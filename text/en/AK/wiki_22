<text>U2 are an Irish rock band formed in Dublin in 1976. The group comprises Bono (lead vocals and rhythm guitar), the Edge (lead guitar, keyboards, and backing vocals), Adam Clayton (bass guitar), and Larry Mullen Jr. (drums and percussion). Initially rooted in post-punk, U2&#x27;s musical style has evolved throughout their career, yet has maintained an anthemic quality built on Bono&#x27;s expressive vocals and the Edge&#x27;s chiming, effects-based guitar sounds. Bono&#x27;s lyrics, often embellished with spiritual imagery, focus on personal and sociopolitical themes. Popular for their live performances, the group have staged several elaborate tours over their career.

The band was formed when the members were teenaged pupils of Mount Temple Comprehensive School and had limited musical proficiency. Within four years, they signed with Island Records and released their debut album, &quot;Boy&quot; (1980). Works such as their first UK number-one album, &quot;War&quot; (1983), and singles &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot; and &quot;Pride (In the Name of Love)&quot; helped establish U2&#x27;s reputation as a politically and socially conscious group. Their fourth album, &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot; (1984), was their first collaboration with producers Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois, whose influence resulted in a more abstract, ambient sound for the band. By the mid-1980s, U2 had become renowned globally for their live act, highlighted by their performance at Live Aid in 1985. Their fifth album, &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; (1987), made them international stars and was their greatest critical and commercial success. One of the world&#x27;s best-selling albums with 25 million copies sold, it produced the group&#x27;s only number-one singles in the US to date: &quot;With or Without You&quot; and &quot;I Still Haven&#x27;t Found What I&#x27;m Looking For&quot;.

Facing creative stagnation and a backlash to their documentary and double album &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot; (1988), U2 reinvented themselves in the 1990s. Beginning with their acclaimed seventh album, &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; (1991), and the multimedia spectacle of the Zoo TV Tour, the band pursued a new musical direction influenced by alternative rock, electronic dance music, and industrial music, and they embraced a more ironic, flippant image. This experimentation continued on &quot;Zooropa&quot; (1993) and concluded with &quot;Pop&quot; (1997) and the PopMart Tour. &quot;All That You Can&#x27;t Leave Behind&quot; (2000) and &quot;How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb&quot; (2004), saw a return to a more conventional, mainstream sound. The U2 360° Tour of 2009–2011 set records for the highest-attended and highest-grossing concert tour, which stood until 2019. &quot;Songs of Innocence&quot; (2014) received criticism for its pushed release through the iTunes Store. In 2023, U2 released &quot;Songs of Surrender&quot;, an album of re-recorded songs, and began the U2:UV &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; Live concert residency to inaugurate Sphere in the Las Vegas Valley.

U2 have released 15 studio albums and are one of the world&#x27;s best-selling music artists, having sold an estimated 150–170 million records worldwide. They have won 22 Grammy Awards—the most of any band—and in 2005, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in their first year of eligibility. According to &quot;Pollstar&quot;, they were the second-highest-grossing live music artist from 1980 to 2022, earning US$2.13 billion. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked U2 at number 22 on its list of the &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot;. Throughout their career, as a band and as individuals, they have campaigned for human rights and social justice causes, working with organisations and coalitions that include Amnesty International, Jubilee 2000, DATA/the ONE Campaign, Product Red, War Child, and Music Rising.
== History ==
=== Formation and early years (1976–1980) ===

In 1976, Larry Mullen Jr., then a 14-year-old pupil of Mount Temple Comprehensive School in Dublin, Ireland, posted a note on the school&#x27;s notice board in search of musicians for a new band. For the first practice, which was held on 25 September in Mullen&#x27;s kitchen, Mullen played drums and was joined by at least five other people: Paul Hewson (&quot;Bono Vox&quot;) on lead vocals; David Evans (&quot;the Edge&quot;) and his older brother Dik Evans on guitar; Adam Clayton, a friend of the Evans brothers, on bass guitar; and Ivan McCormick. Mullen later described it as &quot;&#x27;The Larry Mullen Band&#x27; for about ten minutes, then Bono walked in and blew any chance I had of being in charge.&quot; Peter Martin, a friend of Mullen and McCormick, loaned his guitar and amplifier for the first practice, but he could not play and was quickly phased out; sources differ on whether he was in attendance at the first meeting or not. Within a few weeks, McCormick was also dropped from the group. The remaining five members settled on the name &quot;Feedback&quot; for the group because it was one of the few technical terms they knew. Early rehearsals took place in their music teacher&#x27;s classroom at Mount Temple. Most of their initial material consisted of cover songs, which they admitted was not their forte. The emergence of punk rock, in particular the influence of acts such as the Stranglers, the Jam, the Clash, Buzzcocks, and Sex Pistols, convinced them that musical proficiency was not a prerequisite to success.

In April 1977, Feedback played their first gig for a paying audience at St. Fintan&#x27;s High School. Shortly thereafter, the band changed their name to &quot;The Hype&quot;. Dik Evans, who was older and by that time attending college, was becoming the odd man out of the group. The other members were leaning towards the idea of a four-piece ensemble. In March 1978, the group changed their name to &quot;U2&quot;, selecting it from a list of six options suggested by Steve Averill, a punk rock musician with the Radiators from Space and a family friend of Clayton. The band chose U2 for its open-ended interpretations, visual strength on posters, and because it was the name that they disliked the least. Dik Evans officially left the band with a farewell concert at the Presbyterian Hall in Sutton on 4 March. During the show, which featured the group playing cover songs as the Hype, Dik ceremonially walked offstage. The remaining four members returned later in the concert to play original material as U2. Dik joined the Virgin Prunes, a band made up of mutual friends of U2; early on, the Prunes served as U2&#x27;s default opening act, and the two groups often shared members for live performances to fill in for occasional absences. On 18 March, the four-piece U2 won the &quot;Pop Group &#x27;78&quot; talent contest sponsored by the &quot;Evening Press&quot; and Guinness&#x27;s Harp Lager as part of Limerick Civic Week. The win was an important milestone and affirmation for the fledgling act. The contest prize consisted of () and a recording session for a demo that would be heard by the record label CBS Ireland. U2&#x27;s demo tape was recorded at Keystone Studios in Dublin in April 1978, but the results were largely unsuccessful due to their inexperience.
Irish magazine &quot;Hot Press&quot; was influential in shaping U2&#x27;s future; in addition to being one of their earliest allies, the publication&#x27;s journalist Bill Graham introduced the band to Paul McGuinness, who agreed to be their manager in mid-1978. With the connections he was making within the music industry, McGuinness booked demo sessions for the group and sought to garner them a record deal. The band continued to build their fanbase with performances across Ireland, the most famous of which were a series of weekend afternoon shows at Dublin&#x27;s Dandelion Market in mid-1979. 

In August 1979, U2 recorded demos at Windmill Lane Studios with CBS talent scout Chas de Whalley as producer, marking the first of the band&#x27;s many recordings at the studio during their career. The following month, three songs from the session were released by CBS in Ireland as the EP &quot;Three&quot;. It was the group&#x27;s first chart success, selling all 1,000 copies of its limited edition 12-inch vinyl almost immediately. In December 1979, the band performed in London for their first shows outside Ireland, although they were unable to gain much attention from audiences or critics. On 26 February 1980, their second single, &quot;Another Day&quot;, was released on the CBS label, again only for the Irish market. The same day, U2 performed at the 2,000-seat National Stadium in Dublin as part of an Irish tour. Despite their gamble of booking a concert in such a large venue, the move paid off. Bill Stewart, an A&amp;R representative for Island Records, was in attendance and offered to sign them to the label. The following month, the band signed a four-year, four-album contract with Island, which included a advance () and in tour support.

=== &quot;Boy&quot; and &quot;October&quot; (1980–1982) ===

In May 1980, U2 released &quot;11 O&#x27;Clock Tick Tock&quot;, their first international single and their debut on Island, but it failed to chart. Martin Hannett, who produced the single, was in consideration to produce the band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Boy&quot;, but was replaced with Steve Lillywhite. From July to September 1980, U2 recorded the album at Windmill Lane Studios, drawing from their nearly 40-song repertoire at the time. Lillywhite employed an experimental approach as producer, setting up Mullen&#x27;s drums in a stairwell and recording overdubs such as smashed bottles and cutlery skimmed against a spinning bicycle wheel. The band found Lillywhite very encouraging and creative; Bono called him &quot;such a breath of fresh air&quot;, and the Edge said he &quot;had a great way of pulling the best out of everybody&quot;. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;A Day Without Me&quot;, was released in August. Although it did not chart, the song was the impetus for the Edge&#x27;s purchase of a delay effect unit, the Electro-Harmonix Memory Man, which came to define his guitar playing style.

Released in October 1980, &quot;Boy&quot; received generally positive reviews. Paul Morley of &quot;NME&quot; called it &quot;touching, precocious, full of archaic and modernist conviction&quot;, while Declan Lynch of &quot;Hot Press&quot; said he found it &quot;almost impossible to react negatively to U2&#x27;s music&quot;. Bono&#x27;s lyrics reflected on adolescence, innocence, and the passage into adulthood, themes represented on the album cover by a closeup of an adolescent Peter Rowen, the younger brother of Bono&#x27;s friend Guggi. &quot;Boy&quot; peaked at number 52 in the United Kingdom and number 63 in the United States. The album included the band&#x27;s first songs to receive airplay on US radio, including the single &quot;I Will Follow&quot;, which reached number 20 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top Tracks rock chart. &quot;Boy&quot;″s release was followed by the Boy Tour, U2&#x27;s first tour of continental Europe and the US. Reviewing the band&#x27;s early live performances, critics complimented their ambition and Bono&#x27;s exuberance, and found the shows to be illustrative of U2&#x27;s potential despite lacking polish.
The band faced several challenges in writing their second album, &quot;October.&quot; On an American leg of the Boy Tour, Bono&#x27;s briefcase containing in-progress lyrics and musical ideas was lost backstage during a March 1981 performance at a nightclub in Portland, Oregon. The band had limited time to write new music on tour and in July began a two-month recording session at Windmill Lane Studios largely unprepared, forcing Bono to quickly improvise lyrics. Lillywhite, reprising his role as producer, called the sessions &quot;completely chaotic and mad&quot;. &quot;October&quot;″s lead single, &quot;Fire&quot;, was released in July and was U2&#x27;s first song to chart in the UK. Despite earning the band an appearance on UK television programme &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, the single fell in the charts afterwards. On 16 August 1981, the group opened for Thin Lizzy at the inaugural Slane Concert; the Edge called it one of U2&#x27;s worst shows. Adding to this period of self-doubt, Bono&#x27;s, the Edge&#x27;s, and Mullen&#x27;s involvement in a Charismatic Christian group in Dublin called the &quot;Shalom Fellowship&quot; led them to question the relationship between their religious faith and the lifestyle of a rock band. Bono and the Edge considered quitting U2 due to their perceived spiritual conflicts before deciding to leave Shalom instead.
&quot;October&quot; was released in October 1981 and contained overtly spiritual themes. The album received mixed reviews and limited radio play. It debuted at number 11 in the UK, but sold poorly elsewhere. The single &quot;Gloria&quot; was U2&#x27;s first song to have its music video played on MTV, generating excitement for the band during the October Tour of 1981–1982 in markets where the television channel was available. During the tour, U2 met Dutch photographer Anton Corbijn, who became their principal photographer and has had a major influence on their public image. In March 1982, the band played 14 dates as the opening act for the J. Geils Band. U2 were disappointed by their lack of progress by the end of the October Tour. Having run out of money and feeling unsupported by their record label, the group committed to improving; Clayton recalled that &quot;there was a firm resolve to come out of the box fighting with the next record&quot;.

===&quot;War&quot; and &quot;Under a Blood Red Sky&quot; (1982–1983)===
After the October Tour, U2 decamped to a rented cottage in Howth, where they lived, wrote new songs, and rehearsed for their third album, &quot;War&quot;. Significant musical breakthroughs were achieved by the Edge in August 1982 during a two-week period of independent songwriting, while the other band members holidayed and Bono honeymooned with his wife, Ali. From September to November, the group recorded &quot;War&quot; at Windmill Lane Studios. Lillywhite, who had a policy of not working with an artist more than twice, was convinced by the group to return as producer for a third time. The recording sessions featured contributions from violinist Steve Wickham and the female singers of Kid Creole and the Coconuts. For the first time, Mullen played drums to a click track to keep time. After completing the album, U2 played a short tour of Western Europe in December.
&quot;War&quot;″s lead single, &quot;New Year&#x27;s Day&quot;, was released in January 1983. It reached number 10 in the UK and became the group&#x27;s first hit outside Europe; in the US, it received extensive radio coverage and peaked at number 53. Resolving their doubts of the &quot;October&quot; period, U2 released &quot;War&quot; in February. Critically, the album received favourable reviews, although a few UK reviewers were critical of it. It was the band&#x27;s first commercial success, debuting at number one in the UK, while reaching number 12 in the US. &quot;War&quot;″s sincerity and &quot;rugged&quot; guitar were intentionally at odds with the trendier synthpop of the time. Described as a record on which the band &quot;turned pacifism itself into a crusade&quot;, &quot;War&quot; was lyrically more political than their first two records, focusing on the physical and emotional effects of warfare. The album included the protest song &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot;, in which Bono lyrically contrasted the events of the 1972 Bloody Sunday shooting with Easter Sunday. Other songs addressed nuclear proliferation (&quot;Seconds&quot;) and the Polish Solidarity movement (&quot;New Year&#x27;s Day&quot;). &quot;War&quot; was U2&#x27;s first record to feature Corbijn&#x27;s photography. An adolescent Rowen was again featured on the album cover, with his previously innocent expression replaced by a fearful one.

On the subsequent 1983 War Tour of Europe, the US and Japan, the band played progressively larger venues, moving from clubs to halls to arenas. Bono attempted to engage the growing audiences with theatrical, often dangerous antics, climbing scaffolding and lighting rigs and jumping into the audience. The sight of Bono waving a white flag during performances of &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot; became the tour&#x27;s iconic image. The band played several dates at large European and American music festivals, including a performance at the US Festival on Memorial Day weekend for an audience of 125,000 people. Nearly rained out, the group&#x27;s 5 June 1983 concert at Red Rocks Amphitheatre was singled out by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; as one of &quot;50 Moments that Changed the History of Rock and Roll&quot;. The show was recorded for the concert video &quot;Live at Red Rocks&quot;, and was one of several concerts from the tour captured on their live album &quot;Under a Blood Red Sky&quot;. The releases received extensive play on MTV and the radio, expanding the band&#x27;s audience and showcasing their prowess as a live act. During the tour, the group established a new tradition by closing concerts with the &quot;War&quot; track &quot;40&quot;, during which the Edge and Clayton would exchange instruments and the band members would leave the stage one by one as the crowd continued to sing the refrain &quot;How long to sing this song?&quot;. The War Tour was U2&#x27;s first profitable tour, grossing about .

=== &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot; and Live Aid (1984–1985) ===
With their record deal with Island Records coming to an end, U2 signed a more lucrative extension in 1984. They negotiated the return of the copyrights of their songs, an increase in their royalty rate, and a general improvement in terms, at the expense of a larger initial payment.

Following the &quot;War&quot; album and tour, U2 feared that they were in danger of becoming another &quot;shrill&quot;, &quot;sloganeering arena-rock band&quot;. While they were confident that fans would embrace them as successors to groups like the Who and Led Zeppelin, according to Bono: &quot;something just didn&#x27;t feel right. We felt we had more dimension than just the next big anything, we had something unique to offer.&quot; They sought experimentation for their fourth studio album, &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot;. Clayton said, &quot;We were looking for something that was a bit more serious, more arty.&quot; The Edge admired the ambient and &quot;weird works&quot; of Brian Eno, who, along with his engineer Daniel Lanois, eventually agreed to produce the record. The decision to hire them was against the wishes of Island Records founder Chris Blackwell, who believed that just when the band were about to achieve the highest levels of success, Eno would &quot;bury them under a layer of avant-garde nonsense&quot;.
Partly recorded in Slane Castle, &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot; was released in October 1984 and marked a major change of style. It was ambient and abstract, and featured a rich, orchestrated sound. Under Lanois&#x27; direction, Mullen&#x27;s drumming became looser, funkier, and more subtle, and Clayton&#x27;s bass became more subtle. Complementing the album&#x27;s atmospheric sound, the lyrics were left open to interpretation, providing what the band called a &quot;very visual feel&quot;. Due to a tight recording schedule, Bono felt songs like &quot;Bad&quot; and &quot;Pride (In the Name of Love)&quot; were incomplete &quot;sketches&quot;. The album reached number one in the UK, and was successful in the US. The lead single &quot;Pride (In the Name of Love)&quot;, written about civil rights movement leader Martin Luther King Jr., was their first song to chart in the US top 40.
Much of the Unforgettable Fire Tour moved into indoor arenas as U2 built their audience. The complex textures of the new studio-recorded tracks, such as &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot; and &quot;Bad&quot;, was hard to translate to live performances. One solution was programming music sequencers, which the band had previously been reluctant to use but now incorporate into the majority of their performances. Songs on the album had been criticised as being &quot;unfinished&quot;, &quot;fuzzy&quot;, and &quot;unfocused&quot;, but were better received by critics when played on stage. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, which was critical of the album version of &quot;Bad&quot;, described its live performance as a &quot;show stopper&quot;.

In March 1985, a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; cover story called U2 the &quot;Band of the &#x27;80s&quot;, saying that &quot;for a growing number of rock &amp; roll fans, U2... has become the band that matters most, maybe even the only band that matters&quot;. On 13 July 1985, the group performed at the Live Aid concert at Wembley Stadium for Ethiopian famine relief, before a crowd of 72,000 fans and a worldwide television audience of 1.5 billion people. During a 12-minute performance of &quot;Bad&quot;, Bono climbed down from the stage to embrace and dance with a female fan he had picked out of the crowd, showing a global audience the personal connection that he could make with fans. The performance was a pivotal event in the band&#x27;s career; &quot;The Guardian&quot; cited Live Aid as the moment that made stars of U2, and it included their performance on a list of 50 key events in rock history.

=== &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; and &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot; (1986–1990) ===
For their fifth album, &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot;, the band wanted to build on &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot;″s textures, but instead of experimentation, sought a harder-hitting sound within the limitation of conventional song structures. Realising that &quot;U2 had no tradition&quot; and that their knowledge of music from before their childhood was limited, the group delved into American and Irish roots music. Friendships with Bob Dylan, Van Morrison, and Keith Richards motivated Bono to explore blues, folk, and gospel music and to focus on his skills as a songwriter and lyricist. U2 halted the album sessions in June 1986 to play as a headline act on the Conspiracy of Hope benefit concert tour for Amnesty International. Rather than distract the band, the tour invigourated their new material. The following month, Bono travelled to Nicaragua and El Salvador and saw first-hand the distress of peasants affected by political conflicts and US military intervention. The experience became a central influence on their new music.
&quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; was released in March 1987. The album juxtaposes antipathy towards US foreign policy against the group&#x27;s deep fascination with the country, its open spaces, freedom, and ideals. The band wanted music with a sense of location and a &quot;cinematic&quot; quality, and the record draws on imagery created by American writers whose works the band had been reading. &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; was critically acclaimed; Robert Hilburn of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said the album &quot;confirms on record what this band has been slowly asserting for three years now on stage: U2 is what the Rolling Stones ceased being years ago—the greatest rock and roll band in the world&quot;. The record went to number one in over 20 countries, including the UK where it received a platinum certification in 48 hours and sold 235,000 copies in its first week, making it the fastest seller in British chart history at the time. In the US, it spent nine consecutive weeks at number one. The album included the hit singles &quot;With or Without You&quot;, &quot;I Still Haven&#x27;t Found What I&#x27;m Looking For&quot;, and &quot;Where the Streets Have No Name&quot;, the first two of which became the group&#x27;s only number-one hits in the US. U2 became the fourth rock band to be featured on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine, which called them &quot;Rock&#x27;s Hottest Ticket&quot;. The album and its songs received four Grammy Award nominations, winning Album of the Year and Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. Many publications, including &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, have cited &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; as one of rock&#x27;s greatest albums. The Joshua Tree Tour was the first tour on which the band played shows in stadiums alongside smaller arena shows. It was the highest-grossing North American tour of the year with earned at the box office, and globally it grossed from 3.17 million tickets sold.

In October 1988, the group released &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot;, a double album and theatrically released documentary film that captured the band&#x27;s experiences with American roots music on the Joshua Tree Tour. The record featured nine studio tracks and six live U2 performances, including recordings at Sun Studio in Memphis and collaborations with Dylan and B.B. King. Intended as a tribute to American music, one &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; editor spoke of the album&#x27;s &quot;excitement&quot; and another described it as &quot;misguided and bombastic&quot;. The film&#x27;s director, Phil Joanou, described it as &quot;an overly pretentious look at U2&quot;. The film underperformed at the box office and was withdrawn from theatres after three weeks, having grossed only . Despite the criticism, the album sold 14 million copies and reached number one worldwide. Lead single &quot;Desire&quot; became the band&#x27;s first number-one song in the UK while reaching number three in the US. Most of the album&#x27;s new material was played on 1989–1990&#x27;s Lovetown Tour, which visited Australasia, Japan, and Europe. They had grown dissatisfied with their live performances; Mullen recalled, &quot;We were the biggest, but we weren&#x27;t the best&quot;. With a sense of musical stagnation, Bono hinted at changes to come during a 30 December 1989 concert near the end of the tour; before a hometown crowd in Dublin, he said on stage that it was &quot;the end of something for U2&quot; and that they had to &quot;go away and ... just dream it all up again&quot;.
=== &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;, Zoo TV, and &quot;Zooropa&quot; (1990–1993) ===
Stung by the criticism of &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot;, the band sought to transform themselves musically. Seeking inspiration from German reunification, they began work on their seventh studio album, &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;, at Berlin&#x27;s Hansa Studios in October 1990 with producers Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno. The sessions were fraught, as the band argued over their musical direction and the quality of their material. Clayton and Mullen preferred a sound similar to U2&#x27;s previous work; Bono and the Edge were inspired by European industrial music and electronic dance music and advocated a change. Weeks of tension and slow progress nearly prompted the group to break up until they made a breakthrough with the improvised writing of the song &quot;One&quot;. They returned to Dublin in 1991, where morale improved and the majority of the album was completed.

&quot;Achtung Baby&quot; was released in November 1991. The album represented a calculated change in musical and thematic style, their most dramatic since &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot;. Sonically, the record incorporated influences from alternative rock, dance, and industrial music, and Bono referred to it as &quot;four men chopping down the Joshua Tree&quot;. Thematically, it was a more introspective and personal record; it was darker, yet more flippant than the band&#x27;s previous work. Commercially and critically, it has been one of the band&#x27;s most successful albums. It produced five hit singles, including &quot;The Fly&quot;, &quot;Mysterious Ways&quot;, and &quot;One&quot;, and was a crucial part of the band&#x27;s early 1990s reinvention. In 1993, &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; won the Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. Like &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot;, many publications have cited the record as one of rock&#x27;s greatest.
Like &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;, the 1992–1993 Zoo TV Tour was a break with the band&#x27;s past. In contrast to the austere stage setups of previous U2 tours, Zoo TV was an elaborate multimedia event. It satirised the pervasive nature of television and its blurring of news, entertainment, and home shopping by attempting to instill &quot;sensory overload&quot; in its audience. The stage featured large video screens that showed visual effects, random video clips from pop culture, and flashing text phrases, along with a lighting system partially made of Trabant cars. U2 were known for their earnest performances in the 1980s, but the Zoo TV performances were intentionally ironic and self-deprecating. Bono performed as several over-the-top characters, including the leather-clad egomaniac &quot;The Fly&quot;, the greedy televangelist &quot;Mirror Ball Man&quot;, and the devilish &quot;MacPhisto&quot;. Prank phone calls were made to US President George H. W. Bush, the United Nations, and others. Live satellite link-ups to war-torn Sarajevo caused controversy. Zoo TV was the highest-grossing North American tour of 1992, earning .

In June 1993, U2 signed a six-album deal to remain with Island Records/PolyGram. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; estimated that the deal was worth to the band, making them the highest-paid rock group ever. The following month, the group released a new album, &quot;Zooropa&quot;. Quickly recorded during a break in the Zoo TV Tour in early 1993, it expanded on many of the themes from &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; and the tour. Initially intended to be an EP, &quot;Zooropa&quot; evolved into a full-length LP album. It delved further into electronic, industrial, and dance music. Country musician Johnny Cash sang the lead vocals on the closing track &quot;The Wanderer&quot;. Most of the songs were played at least once during the 1993 legs of the tour, which visited Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan; half the album&#x27;s tracks became long-term fixtures in the setlist. The commercially successful &quot;Zooropa&quot; won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album in 1994; the band regard it as &quot;an interlude&quot;.

Clayton&#x27;s issues with alcohol came to a head on the final leg of the Zoo TV Tour. After experiencing a blackout, Clayton was unable to perform for the group&#x27;s 26 November 1993 show in Sydney, which served as the dress rehearsal for a worldwide television broadcast the following night. Bass guitar technician Stuart Morgan filled in for him, the first time a member of U2 had missed a concert since their earliest days. After the incident, Clayton resolved to stop drinking alcohol. The tour concluded the following month in Japan. It earned 5.3 million in ticket sales and in gross revenues. &quot;Q&quot;″s Tom Doyle said in 2002 that Zoo TV was &quot;the most spectacular rock tour staged by any band&quot;.

=== Passengers, &quot;Pop&quot;, and PopMart (1994–1998) ===
In 1995, following a long break, U2 contributed &quot;Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me&quot; to the soundtrack album of the film &quot;Batman Forever&quot;. The song reached number one in Australia and Ireland, number two in the UK, and number 16 in the US. In November, the band released an experimental album called &quot;Original Soundtracks 1&quot;, a collaboration with Brian Eno, who contributed as a full songwriting partner and performer. Due to his participation and the record&#x27;s experimental nature, the band released it under the moniker &quot;Passengers&quot; to distinguish it from U2&#x27;s conventional albums. Mullen said of the release: &quot;There&#x27;s a thin line between interesting music and self-indulgence. We crossed it on the Passengers record.&quot; It was commercially unnoticed by U2 standards and it received mixed reviews. The single &quot;Miss Sarajevo&quot; (featuring Luciano Pavarotti) was among Bono&#x27;s favourite U2 songs.

U2 began work on their next studio album, &quot;Pop&quot;, in mid-1995, holding recording sessions with Nellee Hooper, Flood, and Howie B. The band mixed the contrasting influences of each producer into their music, in particular Howie B&#x27;s experiences with electronica and dance music. Mullen was sidelined due to back surgery in November, prompting the other band members to take different approaches to songwriting, such as programming drum loops and playing to samples provided by Howie B. Upon Mullen&#x27;s return in February 1996, the group began reworking their material but struggled to complete songs, causing them to miss their mid-year deadline to complete the record. The band allowed manager Paul McGuinness to book their 1997–1998 PopMart Tour with the album still in progress; Bono called it &quot;the worst decision U2 ever made&quot;. Rushed to complete the album, the band delayed its release date a second time from late 1996 to March 1997, cutting into tour rehearsal time. Even with the additional recording time, U2 worked up to the last minute to complete songs.

In February 1997, the group released &quot;Pop&quot;″s lead single, &quot;Discothèque&quot;, a dance-heavy song with a music video in which the band wore Village People costumes. The song reached number one in the UK, Japan, and Canada, but did not chart for long in the US despite debuting at number 10. Within days of the single&#x27;s release, the group announced the PopMart Tour with a press conference in the lingerie section of a Kmart department store. Tickets went on sale shortly after, but &quot;Pop&quot; would not be released until March. The album represented U2&#x27;s further exploration of nightclub culture, featuring heavy, funky dance rhythms. The record drew favourable reviews. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; stated that U2 had &quot;defied the odds and made some of the greatest music of their lives&quot;. Other critics felt that the album was a major disappointment. Despite debuting at number one in over 30 countries, &quot;Pop&quot; dropped off the charts quickly. Bono admitted that the album &quot;didn&#x27;t communicate the way it was intended to&quot;, while the Edge called it a &quot;compromise project by the end&quot;.
The PopMart Tour began in April 1997 and was intended as a satire of consumerism. The stage included a 100-foot-tall (30 m) golden yellow arch reminiscent of the McDonald&#x27;s logo, a 40-foot-tall (12 m) mirrorball lemon, and a 150-foot-long (46 m) LED video screen, at the time the world&#x27;s largest. U2&#x27;s &quot;big shtick&quot; failed to satisfy many who were seemingly confused by the band&#x27;s new kitsch image and the tour&#x27;s elaborate set. The reduced rehearsal time for the tour affected the quality of early shows, and in some US markets, the band played to half-empty stadiums. On several occasions, the mirrorball lemon from which the band emerged for the encores malfunctioned, trapping them inside. Despite the mixed reviews and difficulties of the tour, Bono considered PopMart to be &quot;better than Zoo TV aesthetically, and as an art project it is a clearer thought.&quot; He later explained, &quot;When that show worked, it was mindblowing.&quot;

The group&#x27;s 20 September 1997 show in Reggio Emilia was attended by over 150,000 people, which was reported to have set a world record for the largest paying audience for a one-act show. U2 also performed in Sarajevo on 23 September, making them the first major group to stage a concert there following the Bosnian War. Mullen described the show as &quot;an experience I will never forget for the rest of my life, and if I had to spend 20 years in the band just to play that show, and have done that, I think it would have been worthwhile.&quot; Bono called the show &quot;one of the toughest and one of the sweetest nights of my life.&quot; The tour concluded in March 1998 with gross revenues of and 3.98 million tickets sold. The following month, U2 appeared on the 200th episode of the animated sitcom &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, in which Homer Simpson disrupts the band on stage during a PopMart concert. In November 1998, U2 released their first compilation album, &quot;The Best of 1980–1990&quot;, which featured a re-recording of a 1987 B-side, &quot;Sweetest Thing&quot;, as its single. The album broke a first-week sales record in the US for a greatest hits collection by a group, and &quot;Sweetest Thing&quot; topped the singles charts in Ireland and Canada.

=== &quot;All That You Can&#x27;t Leave Behind&quot; and Elevation Tour (1998–2002) ===
Following their musical pursuits in the 1990s, U2 sought to simplify their sound; the Edge said that with &quot;Pop&quot;, the group had &quot;taken the deconstruction of the rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll band format to its absolute &#x27;nth degree&quot;. For their tenth album, &quot;All That You Can&#x27;t Leave Behind&quot;, the group wanted to return to their old recording ethos of &quot;the band in a room playing together&quot;. Reuniting with Eno and Lanois, U2 began working on the album in late 1998. After their experiences with being pressured to complete &quot;Pop&quot;, the band were content to work without deadlines. With Bono&#x27;s schedule limited by his commitments to debt relief for Jubilee 2000 and the other band members spending time with their families, the recording sessions lasted until August 2000.

Released that October, &quot;All That You Can&#x27;t Leave Behind&quot; was seen by critics as a &quot;back to basics&quot; album, on which the group returned to a more mainstream, conventional rock sound. For many of those not won over by the band&#x27;s forays into dance music, it was considered a return to grace; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called it U2&#x27;s &quot;third masterpiece&quot; alongside &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; and &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;. The album debuted at number one in 32 countries and sold 12 million copies. Its lead single, &quot;Beautiful Day&quot;, reached number one in Ireland, the UK, Australia, and Canada, and number 21 in the US. The song won Grammy Awards for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, Song of the Year, and Record of the Year. At the awards ceremony, Bono declared that U2 were &quot;reapplying for the job ... [of] the best band in the world&quot;. The album&#x27;s other singles, &quot;Stuck in a Moment You Can&#x27;t Get Out Of&quot;, &quot;Elevation&quot;, and &quot;Walk On&quot;, reached number one in Canada, and charted in the top five in the UK and top ten in Australia.
The band&#x27;s 2001 Elevation Tour started in March, visiting North America and Europe across three legs. For the tour, U2 performed on a scaled-down stage, returning to arenas after nearly a decade of stadium productions. Mirroring the album&#x27;s themes of &quot;emotional contact, connection, and communication&quot;, the tour&#x27;s set was designed to bring the group closer to their fans; a heart-shaped catwalk around the stage encircled many audience members, and festival seating was offered in the US for the first time in the group&#x27;s history. During the tour, U2 headlined two Slane Concerts in Ireland, playing to crowds of 80,000. Following the September 11 attacks in the US, &quot;All That You Can&#x27;t Leave Behind&quot; found added resonance with American audiences, as the album climbed in the charts and songs such as &quot;Walk On&quot; and &quot;Peace on Earth&quot; received radio airplay. In October, U2 performed at Madison Square Garden in New York City for the first time since the attacks. Bono and the Edge said these shows were among their most memorable and emotional performances. The Elevation Tour was the top-earning North American tour of 2001 with a gross of , the second-highest amount ever at the time for a North American tour. Globally, it grossed from 2.18 million tickets sold, making it the year&#x27;s highest-grossing tour overall. &quot;Spin&quot; named U2 the &quot;Band of the Year&quot; for 2001, saying they had &quot;schooled bands half their age about what a rock show could really accomplish&quot;.

On 3 February 2002, U2 performed during the Super Bowl XXXVI halftime show. In a tribute to those who died in the 11 September attacks, the victims&#x27; names were projected onto a backdrop, and at the end, Bono opened his jacket to reveal an American flag in the lining. &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, and &quot;USA Today&quot; ranked the band&#x27;s performance as the best halftime show in Super Bowl history. Later that month, U2 received four additional Grammy Awards; &quot;All That You Can&#x27;t Leave Behind&quot; won Best Rock Album, while &quot;Walk On&quot; was named Record of the Year, the first time an artist had won the award in consecutive years for songs from the same album. In November 2002, the band released their second compilation, &quot;The Best of 1990–2000&quot;, which featured several remixed 1990s songs and two new tracks, including the single &quot;Electrical Storm&quot;.

=== &quot;How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb&quot; and Vertigo Tour (2003–2006) ===
Looking for a harder-hitting rock sound than that of &quot;All That You Can&#x27;t Leave Behind&quot;, U2 began recording their eleventh studio album, &quot;How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb&quot;, in February 2003 with producer Chris Thomas. After nine months of work, the band had an album&#x27;s worth of material ready for release, but they were not satisfied with the results; Mullen said that the songs &quot;had no magic&quot;. The group subsequently enlisted Steve Lillywhite to take over as producer in Dublin in January 2004. Lillywhite, along with his assistant Jacknife Lee, spent six months with the band reworking songs and encouraging better performances. Several other producers received credits on the album, including Lanois, Eno, Flood, Carl Glanville, and Nellee Hooper; Bono acknowledged that the involvement of multiple producers affected the record&#x27;s &quot;sonic cohesion&quot;.
Released in November 2004, &quot;How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb&quot; received favourable reviews from critics. The album featured lyrics touching on life, death, love, war, faith, and family. It reached number one in 30 countries, including the US, where first-week sales of 840,000 copies nearly doubled those of &quot;All That You Can&#x27;t Leave Behind&quot;, setting a personal best for the band. Overall, it sold 9 million copies globally. For the album&#x27;s release, U2 partnered with Apple for several cross-promotions: the first single, &quot;Vertigo&quot;, was featured in a television advertisement for the company&#x27;s iPod music player, while a U2-branded iPod and digital box set exclusive to the iTunes Store were released. &quot;Vertigo&quot; was an international hit, topping the charts in Ireland and the UK, and reaching number two in Canada and number five in Australia. The song won three Grammy Awards, including one for Best Rock Song. Other singles from the album were also hits; &quot;Sometimes You Can&#x27;t Make It on Your Own&quot;, written as a tribute to Bono&#x27;s late father, went to number one in the UK and Canada, while &quot;City of Blinding Lights&quot; reached number two in both regions. In March 2005, U2 were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by Bruce Springsteen in their first year of eligibility. During his speech, Springsteen said the band had &quot;beaten [the odds] by continuing to do their finest work and remaining at the top of their game and the charts for 25 years&quot;.
U2&#x27;s 2005–2006 Vertigo Tour was preceded by several complications. A sudden illness afflicting the Edge&#x27;s daughter nearly resulted in the tour&#x27;s cancellation, before the group decided to adjust the tour schedule to accommodate her treatment. Additionally, ticket presales on the band&#x27;s website were plagued with issues, as subscribing members encountered technical glitches and limited ticket availability, partially due to scalpers exploiting the system. Commencing in March 2005, the Vertigo Tour consisted of arena shows in North America and stadium shows internationally across five legs. The indoor stage replaced the heart-shaped ramp of the Elevation Tour with an elliptical one and featured retractable video curtains around the stage, while the stadium stage used a massive LED video screen. Setlists on tour varied more than in the group&#x27;s past and included songs they had not played in decades. Like its predecessor, the Vertigo Tour was a commercial success, ranking as the top-earning tour of 2005 with grossed.
In February 2006, U2 received five additional Grammy Awards, including Song of the Year for &quot;Sometimes You Can&#x27;t Make It on Your Own&quot;, and Best Rock Album and Album of the Year for &quot;How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb&quot;; the awards made the album and its singles winners in all eight categories in which U2 were nominated, spanning two separate Grammy ceremonies. The group resumed the Vertigo Tour that month with a Latin American leg, on which several shows were filmed for the concert film &quot;U2 3D&quot;. It was released in theatres nearly two years later, and was the world&#x27;s first live-action digital 3D film. In March, the band postponed the tour&#x27;s remaining shows until the end of the year due to the health of the Edge&#x27;s daughter. On 25 September 2006, U2 and Green Day performed at the Louisiana Superdome prior to an NFL football game, the New Orleans Saints&#x27; first home game in the city since Hurricane Katrina. The two bands covered the Skids&#x27; song &quot;The Saints Are Coming&quot; during the performance and for a benefit single, which reached number one in Australia and throughout Europe. U2 issued an official autobiography, &quot;U2 by U2&quot;, that month, followed in November by their third compilation album, &quot;U218 Singles&quot;. The Vertigo Tour concluded in December, having sold 4.6 million tickets and having earned , the second-highest gross ever at the time.

In August 2006, the band incorporated its publishing business in the Netherlands following the capping of Irish artists&#x27; tax exemption at . The Edge stated that businesses often seek to minimise their tax burdens. The move was criticised in the Irish parliament. The band defended themselves, saying approximately 95% of their business took place outside Ireland, that they were taxed globally because of this, and that they were all &quot;personal investors and employers in the country&quot;. Bono later said, &quot;I think U2&#x27;s tax business is our own business and I think it is not just to the letter of the law but to the spirit of the law.&quot;

=== &quot;No Line on the Horizon&quot; and U2 360° Tour (2006–2011) ===
Recording for U2&#x27;s twelfth album, &quot;No Line on the Horizon&quot;, began with producer Rick Rubin in 2006, but the sessions were short-lived and the material was shelved. In May 2007, the group began new sessions with Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois in Fez, Morocco, involving the producers as full songwriting partners. Intending to write &quot;future hymns&quot;—songs that would be played forever—the group spent two weeks recording in a riad and exploring local music. The Edge called it &quot;a very freeing experience&quot; that &quot;reminded [him] in many ways of early on and why [they] got into a band in the first place. Just that joy of playing.&quot; As recording on the album continued in New York, London, and Dublin, the band scaled back their experimental pursuits, which Eno said &quot;sounded kind of synthetic&quot; and were not easily married with the group&#x27;s sound.

&quot;No Line on the Horizon&quot; was released in February 2009, more than four years after &quot;How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb&quot;, the longest gap between albums of the band&#x27;s career to that point. It received generally positive reviews, including their first five-star &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; review, but critics found it was not as experimental as originally billed. The album debuted at number one in over 30 countries, but its sales of 5 million were seen as a disappointment by U2 standards and it did not contain a hit single. Following the album&#x27;s release, the band discussed tentative plans for a follow-up record entitled &quot;Songs of Ascent&quot;. Bono described the project as &quot;a more meditative album on the theme of pilgrimage&quot;.
The group embarked on the U2 360° Tour in June 2009. It was their first live venture for Live Nation under a 12-year, () contract signed the year prior. As part of the deal, the company assumed control over U2&#x27;s touring, merchandising, and official website. The 360° Tour concerts featured the band playing stadiums &quot;in the round&quot;, allowing the audience to surround them on all sides. To accommodate the stage configuration, a large four-legged structure nicknamed &quot;The Claw&quot; was built above the stage, with the sound system and a cylindrical, expanding video screen on top of it. At tall, it was the largest stage ever constructed. The tour visited Europe and North America in 2009. On 25 October 2009, U2 set a new US record for single concert attendance for one headline act, performing to 97,014 people at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena. In May 2010, while rehearsing for the next leg of the tour, Bono suffered a herniated disk and severe compression of the sciatic nerve, requiring emergency back surgery. The band were forced to postpone the North American leg of the tour and a headlining performance at the Glastonbury Festival 2010 until the following year. After Bono&#x27;s recovery, U2 resumed the 360° Tour in August 2010 with legs in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand, during which they began to play new, unreleased songs live. By its conclusion in July 2011, U2 360° had set records for the highest-grossing concert tour () and most tickets sold for a tour (7.3 million).

=== &quot;Songs of Innocence&quot; and Innocence + Experience Tour (2011–2015) ===

Throughout the 360° Tour, the band worked on multiple projects, including a rock album produced by Danger Mouse, a dance record produced by RedOne and will.i.am, and &quot;Songs of Ascent&quot;. The latter was not completed to their satisfaction, and by December 2011, Clayton admitted it would not come to fruition. The sessions with Danger Mouse formed the foundation of U2&#x27;s next album, and they worked with him until May 2013 before enlisting the help of producers Paul Epworth, Ryan Tedder, Declan Gaffney, and Flood. The band suspended work on the album late in 2013 to contribute a new song, &quot;Ordinary Love&quot;, to the film &quot;&quot;. The track, written in honour of Nelson Mandela, won the 2014 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. In November 2013, U2&#x27;s manager Paul McGuinness stepped down as part of a deal with Live Nation to acquire his management firm, Principle Management. McGuinness, who had managed the group for over 30 years, was succeeded by Guy Oseary. In February 2014, the single &quot;Invisible&quot;, debuted in a Super Bowl television advertisement and was made available in the iTunes Store at no cost to launch a partnership with Product Red and Bank of America to fight AIDS. Bono called the track a &quot;sneak preview&quot; of their pending record.

On 9 September 2014, U2 appeared at an Apple product launch event to make a surprise announcement of their thirteenth studio album, &quot;Songs of Innocence&quot;. They released it digitally the same day to all iTunes Store customers at no cost, making it available to over 500 million people in what Apple CEO Tim Cook called &quot;the largest album release of all time&quot;. Apple reportedly paid Universal Music Group and U2 a lump sum for a five-week exclusivity period in which to distribute the album and spent on a promotional campaign. &quot;Songs of Innocence&quot; recalls the group members&#x27; youth in Ireland, touching on childhood experiences, loves and losses, while paying tribute to their musical inspirations. Bono described it as &quot;the most personal album we&#x27;ve written&quot;. The record received mixed reviews and was criticised for its digital release strategy; it was automatically added to users&#x27; iTunes accounts, which for many, triggered an unprompted download to their electronic devices. Chris Richards of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called the release &quot;rock-and-roll as dystopian junk mail&quot;. The group&#x27;s press tour for the album was interrupted after Bono was seriously injured in a bicycle accident in Central Park on 16 November 2014. He suffered fractures of his shoulder blade, humerus, orbit, and pinky finger, leading to uncertainty that he would ever be able to play guitar again.
Following Bono&#x27;s recuperation, U2 embarked on the Innocence + Experience Tour in May 2015, visiting arenas in North America and Europe from May to December. The group structured their concerts around a loose autobiographical narrative of &quot;innocence&quot; passing into &quot;experience&quot;, with a fixed set of songs for the first half of each show and a varying second half, separated by an intermission—a first for U2 concerts. The stage spanned the length of the venue floor and had three sections: a rectangular main stage, a smaller circular B-stage, and a connecting walkway. The centrepiece of the set was a double-sided video screen that featured an interior catwalk, allowing the band members to perform amidst the video projections. U2&#x27;s sound system was moved to the venue ceilings and arranged in an oval array to improve the sound. The tour grossed from 1.29 million tickets sold. The final date of the tour, one of two Paris shows rescheduled due to the 13 November 2015 attacks in the city, was filmed for the video &quot;Innocence + Experience: Live in Paris&quot; and broadcast on the American television network HBO.

===&quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; anniversary tours and &quot;Songs of Experience&quot; (2016–2019)===
In 2016, U2 worked on their next studio album, &quot;Songs of Experience&quot;, a companion piece to &quot;Songs of Innocence&quot;. The group had mostly completed the album and planned to release it that year, but after the shift of global politics in a conservative direction, highlighted by the UK&#x27;s Brexit referendum and the 2016 US presidential election, they put the record on hold to reassess its tone. The group spent the extra time rewriting lyrics, rearranging and remixing songs, and pursuing different production styles. Further impacting the lyrical direction of the album was a &quot;brush with mortality&quot; that Bono experienced; in December 2016, he underwent open-heart surgery due to an aortic aneurysm that formed over time as a result of having a bicuspid aortic valve.
U2 toured in 2017 to commemorate the 30th anniversary of &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot;, with each show featuring a performance of the entire album. It was the first time the group toured in promotion of an album from their back catalogue. The Edge cited the same world events that caused the group to delay &quot;Songs of Experience&quot; for what he judged to be renewed resonance of &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot;″s subject matter and a reason to revisit it. The tour&#x27;s stage featured a 7.6K video screen measuring that was, according to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, the largest and highest resolution screen used on a concert tour. The tour included a headlining appearance at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in June. The tour grossed more than from over 2.7 million tickets sold, making it the highest-grossing tour of the year.

&quot;Songs of Experience&quot; was released on 1 December 2017. Lyrically, the album reflects the &quot;political and personal apocalypse&quot; that Bono felt in 2016. The first single, &quot;You&#x27;re the Best Thing About Me&quot;, is one of several songs from the record for which Bono wrote the lyrics as letters addressed to people and places closest to his heart. &quot;Songs of Experience&quot; received mixed reviews from critics; it was the sixth-best-selling album globally in 2017 with 1.3 million copies sold.
In May 2018, the band embarked on the Experience + Innocence Tour, which consisted of arena shows across North America and Europe. 
It was a sequel to their 2015 Innocence + Experience Tour, reprising its loose narrative and using a similar stage set. Several enhancements were made, such as a higher resolution and more transparent video screen and the addition of LED panels to the B-stage floor. The band incorporated augmented reality into the shows, releasing a mobile app for concertgoers to use and reviving Bono&#x27;s demonic stage character MacPhisto from the 1993 Zoo TV Tour with the help of a camera filter. The tour concluded in Berlin in November with total revenues of from 924,000 tickets sold, according to &quot;Billboard&quot;.

U2&#x27;s &quot;Joshua Tree&quot; anniversary concert tour visited Oceania and Asia in 2019, their first time playing Australia and New Zealand since the 360° Tour in 2010, and their first time performing in South Korea, Singapore, India, and the Philippines. The band released the single &quot;Ahimsa&quot; with Indian musician A.R. Rahman to promote their December concert in India. The group&#x27;s 2019 shows grossed and sold 567,000 tickets, bringing the cumulative totals for their &quot;Joshua Tree&quot; anniversary tours to grossed and 3.3 million tickets sold.

===&quot;Songs of Surrender&quot; and concert residency at Sphere (2020–current)===
Over a two-year period during lockdowns for the COVID-19 pandemic, the group worked on &quot;Songs of Surrender&quot;, an album of re-recorded and reinterpreted versions of 40 songs from their back catalogue. Largely the effort of the Edge and Bono, the album was recorded with collaborators that included Bob Ezrin, Duncan Stewart, Declan Gaffney, and Stjepan Hauser. The reimagined songs feature stripped-down and acoustic arrangements, in different keys and tempos and often with re-written lyrics. The project was conceived as a companion to Bono&#x27;s memoir &quot;Surrender: 40 Songs, One Story&quot;.

In October 2022, several media outlets reported that U2 were in discussions to sign with Irving Azoff and his son Jeffrey of Full Stop Management, following the end of Guy Oseary&#x27;s nine-year tenure as the band&#x27;s manager.

After releasing his memoir in November 2022, Bono embarked on a book tour that month called &quot;Stories of Surrender&quot;, initially consisting of 14 dates across North America and Europe. During the shows, Bono performed U2 songs in stripped-down arrangements mirroring those from &quot;Songs of Surrender&quot;. The record was released in March 2023. It was the group&#x27;s first number-one album in the UK since 2009, but sales quickly tapered off; it charted in the UK for three weeks, and in the US for one week after reaching number five. The album&#x27;s release coincided with a television documentary film, &quot;Bono &amp; The Edge: A Sort of Homecoming, With Dave Letterman&quot;, that premiered on Disney+. In April, Bono resumed his &quot;Stories of Surrender&quot; book tour with an 11-show residency at the Beacon Theatre in New York City.
From September 2023 to March 2024, U2 staged a 40-date concert residency called U2:UV &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; Live to inaugurate Sphere in the Las Vegas Valley. The residency was announced during a Super Bowl LVII television advertisement. Performances were focused on the group&#x27;s 1991 album &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; and leveraged the venue&#x27;s immersive video and sound capabilities, which include a 16K resolution wraparound LED screen and speakers with beamforming and wave field synthesis technologies. Mullen did not participate in the concerts in order to recuperate from surgery, marking the first time since 1978 that U2 performed without him; Dutch drummer Bram van den Berg from the band Krezip filled in. Coinciding with the beginning of the residency, the group released the Las Vegas-inspired single &quot;Atomic City&quot;.

U2:UV &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; Live was highly acclaimed by critics; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Andy Greene called it &quot;a quantum leap forward for concerts&quot;, and Neil McCormick of &quot;The Telegraph&quot; said it would &quot;change live entertainment forever&quot;. The residency grossed from 663,000 tickets sold, making it the fourth-highest-grossing concert residency of all time. It was filmed for the immersive concert film &quot;V-U2&quot;, which began screening exclusively at Sphere in September 2024.

== Musical style ==
Bono&#x27;s songwriting exhibits a penchant for social, political, and personal subject matter, while maintaining a grandiosity. The Edge has described U2 as a fundamentally live band. U2&#x27;s early sound was punk-influenced alternative rock, and the group were associated with the post-punk movement. Their influences included acts such as Television, Siouxsie and the Banshees, and Joy Division, and their resulting sound was described as containing a &quot;sense of exhilaration&quot; that resulted from the Edge&#x27;s &quot;radiant chords&quot; and Bono&#x27;s &quot;ardent vocals&quot;. According to Bob Stanley, &quot;U2 rejected post-punk&#x27;s own rejection of pop as lingua franca, its hunkering down in regional particularity, and its raised finger to populist communication.&quot; U2 developed a melodic sound under the early influence of record producer Steve Lillywhite at a time when they were not known for musical proficiency. Their songs began as minimalistic and uncomplicated instrumentals heard on &quot;Boy&quot; and &quot;October&quot;, before evolving with &quot;War&quot; to include aspects of rock anthem, funk, and dance rhythms to become more versatile and aggressive. &quot;Boy&quot; and &quot;War&quot; were labelled &quot;muscular and assertive&quot; by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, influenced in large part by Lillywhite&#x27;s production. &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot;, which began with the Edge playing more keyboards than guitars, as well as follow-up &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot;, were produced by Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois. With their influence, both albums achieved a &quot;diverse texture&quot;. The songs from &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; and &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot; placed more emphasis on Lanois-inspired rhythm as they mixed distinct and varied styles of gospel and blues music, which stemmed from the band&#x27;s fascination with America.

In the 1990s, U2 began using synthesisers, distortion, and electronic beats derived from noise music, dance, and hip-hop on &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;, &quot;Zooropa&quot;, and &quot;Pop&quot;. According to Stephen Thomas Erlewine, &quot;U2 was able to sustain their popularity in the &#x27;90s by reinventing themselves as a post-modern, self-consciously ironic dance-inflected pop-rock act, owing equally to the experimentalism of late &#x27;70s Bowie and &#x27;90s electronic dance and techno&quot;. They have also been called a pop-rock band by biographer Michael Heatley and musicologist Gerry Smyth. The band&#x27;s 1990s output has been regarded as an art rock phase in commentaries by biographer John Jobling, &quot;Salon&quot; journalist Nico Lang, and music critic Jim DeRogatis, as well as in an interview by Bono. &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s Josh Tyrangiel went further in saying that, &quot;In the towering period that spanned &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; to &quot;Zooropa&quot;, U2 made stadium-size art rock with huge melodies that allowed Bono to throw his arms around the world while bending its ear about social justice.&quot;

In the 2000s, U2 returned to more stripped-down rock and pop sounds, with more conventional rhythms and reduced usage of synthesisers and effects, &quot;reinvent[ing] themselves as a quality pop band&quot;, according to music journalist Chris Charlesworth. U2&#x27;s music has been regarded as pop in analyses by writers David Hawke, Robert Christgau, and Niall Stokes. In an interview with Stokes for &quot;Hot Press&quot;, Bono explained the band&#x27;s struggles in the 1980s among highbrow circles who patronised them for being a successful pop group, leading to their embrace of the term &quot;pop&quot; by the 1990s. Reviewing their 2000 album &quot;All That You Can&#x27;t Leave Behind&quot;, Christgau remarked that, &quot;since they&#x27;d been calling themselves pop for half of their two-decade run, maybe they&#x27;d better sit down and write some catchy songs. So they did.&quot; Summing up U2&#x27;s stylistic evolution since &quot;Boy&quot;, &quot;Guitar&quot; journalist Owen Bailey said that they &quot;have gone on to conquer the world&#x27;s airwaves and arenas in a number of different incarnations, ranging from earnest, politically charged new-wave flagbearers to wide-eyed art-rock musicologists to purveyors of irony-laden alt-rock and ever onward&quot;, with the Edge remaining &quot;at the heart of their sound&quot;.

===Vocals===

Bono is known for his impassioned vocal style, often delivered in a high register through open-throated belting. He has been classified as a tenor, and according to him has a three-octave vocal range; one analysis found it to span from C to G on studio recordings over the course of his career. He frequently employs &quot;whoa-oh-oh&quot; vocalisations in his singing. Rock musician Billie Joe Armstrong of Green Day said: &quot;He&#x27;s a physical singer, like the leader of a gospel choir, and he gets lost in the melodic moment. He goes to a place outside himself, especially in front of an audience, when he hits those high notes.&quot; He added that Bono is &quot;not afraid to go beyond what he&#x27;s capable of&quot;.

In the early days of U2, Bono unintentionally developed an English vocal accent as a result of him mimicking his musical influences such as Siouxsie and the Banshees. He said that he found his own singing voice after attending a Ramones concert and hearing Joey Ramone sing. Bono&#x27;s vocal style evolved during the band&#x27;s exploration of roots music for &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot;; &quot;Spin&quot; said that he learned to command &quot;the full whisper-to-shout range of blues mannerisms&quot;. Bono attributed this maturation to &quot;loosening up&quot;, &quot;discover[ing] other voices&quot;, and employing more restraint in his singing. For &quot;Where the Streets Have No Name&quot;, he varied the timbre of his voice extensively and used rubato to vary its timing, while author Susan Fast found &quot;With or Without You&quot; to be the first track on which he &quot;extended his vocal range downward in an appreciable way&quot;.

Bono continued to explore a lower range in the 1990s, using what Fast described as &quot;breathy and subdued colors&quot; for &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;. One technique used on the album is octave doubling, in which his vocals are sung in two different octaves, either simultaneously or alternating between verses and choruses. According to Fast, this technique introduces &quot;a contrasting lyrical idea and vocal character to deliver it&quot;, leading to both literal and ironic interpretations of Bono&#x27;s vocals. On tracks such as &quot;Zoo Station&quot; and &quot;The Fly&quot;, his vocals were highly processed, giving them a different emotional feel from his previous work. Bono said that lowering his voice helped him find a new vocal vocabulary, which he felt was limited to &quot;certain words and tones&quot; by his tenor voice. His singing on &quot;Zooropa&quot; was an even further departure from U2&#x27;s previous style; throughout the record, Bono &quot;underplay[ed] his lung power&quot;, according to Jon Pareles, and he also used an operatic falsetto he calls the &quot;Fat Lady&quot; voice on the tracks &quot;Lemon&quot; and &quot;Numb&quot;. As he has aged, Bono has continued to evolve his singing, relying more on &quot;the croon than the belt&quot;, according to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Joe Gross.

=== Guitar ===

The Edge&#x27;s style of playing guitar is distinguished by his chiming timbres, echoing notes, sparse voicings, and extensive use of effects units. He favours the perfect fifth interval and often plays power chords, which are chords consisting of just the fifth and root notes without the third. This style is not explicitly in a minor or major key, but implies both, creating a musical ambiguity. For these chords, he often plays the same notes on multiple strings, some of which are left open, creating an Irish-influenced drone. Against this drone, he changes other notes to imply a harmony. Among the Edge&#x27;s signature techniques are playing arpeggios, sixteenth note percussive strumming, and harmonics, the latter of which he described as &quot;so pure and finely-focused that [they have] the incredible ability to pierce through [their] environment of sound, just like lightning&quot;. His approach to guitar playing is relatively understated and eschews virtuosity in favour of &quot;atmospherics, subtlety, minimalism, and clever signal processing&quot;. Rather than emulate common playing styles, the Edge is interested in &quot;tearing up the rule book&quot; and finding new ways to approach the instrument. He cited guitarists such as Tom Verlaine of Television, John McGeoch, Rory Gallagher, and Patti Smith as some of his strongest influences.

The Edge&#x27;s guitar sound is frequently modulated with a delay set to a dotted eighth note for rhythmic effect. After acquiring his first delay pedal, the Electro-Harmonix Memory Man, he became fascinated with how to use its return echo to &quot;fill in notes that [he&#x27;s] not playing, like two guitar players rather than one&quot;. The effect unit became a mainstay in his guitar rig and had a significant impact on the band&#x27;s creative output. The Edge became known for his extensive use of effects units, and for his meticulous nature in crafting specific sounds and guitar tones from his equipment choices. Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page called him a &quot;sonic architect&quot;, while Neil McCormick described him as an &quot;effects maestro&quot;. Critics have variously referred to the Edge&#x27;s guitar sounds as evoking the image of fighter planes on &quot;Bullet the Blue Sky&quot;, resembling a &quot;dentist&#x27;s drill&quot; on &quot;Love Is Blindness&quot;, and resembling an &quot;airplane turbine&quot; on &quot;Mofo&quot;. The Edge said that rather than using effects merely to modify his sound, he uses them to spark ideas during his songwriting process.

The Edge developed his playing style during his teenage years, partially as a result of him and Mullen trying to accommodate the &quot;eccentric&quot; bass playing of Clayton by being the timekeepers of the band. In their early days, the Edge&#x27;s only guitar was his 1976 Gibson Explorer Limited Edition, which became a signature of the group. He found the sound of the Explorer&#x27;s bass strings unsatisfactory and avoided them in his playing early on, resulting in a trebly sound. He said by focusing &quot;on one area of the fretboard [he] was developing a very stylized way of doing something that someone else would play in a normal way&quot;. His 1964 Vox AC30 &quot;Top Boost&quot; amplifier (housed in a 1970s cabinet) is favoured for its &quot;sparkle&quot; tone, and is the basis for his sound both in the studio and live. Rather than hold his plectrum with a standard grip, the Edge turns it sideways or upside down to use the dimpled edge against the strings, producing a &quot;rasping top end&quot; to his tone.

===Rhythm section===
As a rhythm section, Mullen and Clayton often play the same patterns, giving U2&#x27;s music a driving, pulsating beat that serves as a foundation for the Edge&#x27;s guitar work. For his drumming, Mullen locks into the Edge&#x27;s guitar playing, while Clayton locks his bass playing into Mullen&#x27;s drumming. Author Bill Flanagan said that their playing styles perfectly reflected their personalities: &quot;Larry is right on top of the beat, a bit ahead—as you&#x27;d expect from a man who&#x27;s so ordered and punctual in his life. Adam plays a little behind the beat, waiting till the last moment to slip in, which fits Adam&#x27;s casual, don&#x27;t-sweat-it personality.&quot;
Mullen&#x27;s drumming style is influenced by his experience in marching bands during his adolescence, which helped contribute to the militaristic beats of songs such as &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot;. Flanagan said that he plays &quot;with a martial rigidity but uses his kit in a way a properly trained drummer would not&quot;; he tends to transition from the snare drum onto tom-toms positioned on either side of him, contrasting with how they are traditionally used. Mullen occasionally rides a tom-tom the way other drummers would play a cymbal, or rides the hi-hat how others would play a snare. He admitted his bass drum technique is not a strength, as he mostly played the snare in marching bands and did not learn to properly combine the separate drumming elements together on a full kit. As a result, he uses a floor tom to his left to create the effect of a bass drum. He said, &quot;I couldn&#x27;t do what most people would consider a normal beat for the song, so I chose alternatives.&quot; He was heavily influenced by glam rock acts of the 1970s when first learning to play. In the early days of U2, Mullen had what Bono called a &quot;florid&quot; drumming style, before he pared down his rhythms. His drumming leaves open space, owing to what &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; described as his understanding of &quot;when to hit and when not to hit&quot;. As he matured as a timekeeper, he developed an excellent sense of rhythm; Eno recounted one occasion when Mullen noticed that his click track had been set incorrectly by six milliseconds. Under the tutelage of Lanois, Mullen learned more about his musical role as the drummer in filling out the band&#x27;s sound, while Flood helped him learn to play along with electronic elements such as drum machines and samples. His kit has a tambourine mounted on a cymbal stand, which he uses as an accent on certain beats for songs such as &quot;With or Without You&quot;.
Clayton&#x27;s style of bass guitar playing is noted for what instructor Patrick Pfeiffer called &quot;harmonic syncopation&quot;. With this technique, Clayton plays a consistent rhythm that stresses the eighth note of each bar, but he &quot;anticipates the harmony by shifting the tonality&quot; before the guitar chords do. This gives the music a feeling of &quot;forward motion&quot;. In the band&#x27;s early years, Clayton had no formal musical training, and he generally played simple bass parts in time consisting of steady eighth notes emphasising the roots of chords. Over time, he incorporated influences from Motown and reggae into his playing style, and as he became a better timekeeper, his playing became more melodic. Flanagan said that he &quot;often plays with the swollen, vibrating bottom sound of a Jamaican dub bassist, covering the most sonic space with the smallest number of notes&quot;. Clayton relies on his own instincts when developing basslines, deciding whether to follow the chord progressions of the guitars or play a counter-melody, and when to play an octave higher or lower. He cites bassists such as Paul Simonon, Bruce Foxton, Peter Hook, Jean-Jacques Burnel, and James Jamerson as major influences on him. Describing his role in the rhythm section, Clayton said, &quot;Larry&#x27;s drums have always told me what to play, and then the chords tell me where to go&quot;.

=== Lyrics and themes ===

U2&#x27;s lyrics are known for their social and political themes, and often contain Christian and spiritual imagery. Songs such as &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot;, &quot;Silver and Gold&quot;, and &quot;Mothers of the Disappeared&quot; were motivated by current events. The first was written about the Troubles in Northern Ireland, while the last was a tribute to COMADRES, the women whose children were killed or forcibly disappeared at the hands of the Salvadoran government during the country&#x27;s civil war. The song &quot;Running to Stand Still&quot; from &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; was inspired by the heroin addiction that was sweeping through Dublin—the lyric &quot;I see seven towers, but I only see one way out&quot; references the Ballymun Towers of Dublin&#x27;s Northside and the imagery throughout the song personifies the struggles of addiction.

Bono&#x27;s personal conflicts and turmoil inspired songs like &quot;Mofo&quot;, &quot;Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;Kite&quot;. An emotional yearning or pleading frequently appears as a lyrical theme, in tracks such as &quot;Yahweh&quot;, &quot;Peace on Earth&quot;, and &quot;Please&quot;. Much of U2&#x27;s songwriting and music is motivated by contemplations of loss and anguish, along with hopefulness and resilience, themes that are central to &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot;. Some of these lyrical ideas have been amplified by Bono and the band&#x27;s personal experiences during their youth in Ireland, as well as Bono&#x27;s campaigning and activism later in his life. U2 have used tours such as Zoo TV and PopMart to caricature social trends, such as media overload and consumerism, respectively.

While the band and its fans often affirm the political nature of their songs, U2&#x27;s lyrics and music were criticised as apolitical by &quot;Slate&quot; in 2002 for their perceived vagueness and &quot;fuzzy imagery&quot;, and a lack of any specific references to people.

=== Influences ===

The band cite the Who, the Clash, Television, Ramones, the Beatles, Joy Division, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Elvis Presley, Patti Smith, and Kraftwerk as influences. Van Morrison has been cited by Bono as an influence, and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame mentioned his influence on U2. U2 have also worked with or had influential relationships with artists including Johnny Cash, Green Day, Leonard Cohen, Bruce Springsteen, B.B. King, Lou Reed, Bob Dylan and Luciano Pavarotti. Bono said that David Bowie helped him discover the works of Bertolt Brecht, William Burroughs, Springsteen, and Brian Eno. Fellow Irish rock band the Script have also been influenced by U2.

== Activism and philanthropy ==
Since the early 1980s, the members of U2—as a band and individually—have collaborated with other musicians, artists, celebrities, and politicians to address issues concerning poverty, disease, and social injustice.

In 1984, Bono and Clayton participated in Band Aid to raise money for the 1983–85 famine in Ethiopia. This initiative produced the hit charity single &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot;, the first of several collaborations between U2 and Bob Geldof. In July 1985, U2 performed at Live Aid, a follow-up to Band Aid&#x27;s efforts. Bono and his wife Ali, invited by World Vision, visited Ethiopia that year where they witnessed the famine first-hand. Bono later said that this laid the groundwork for his Africa campaigning and some of his songwriting. In 1986, U2 participated in the Self Aid benefit concert for unemployment in Ireland and the Conspiracy of Hope benefit concert tour in support of Amnesty International. The same year, Bono and Ali also visited Nicaragua and El Salvador at the invitation of the Sanctuary movement and saw the effects of the Salvadoran Civil War. These 1986 events greatly influenced &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; album, which was being recorded at the time.

During their Zoo TV Tour in 1992, U2 participated in the &quot;Stop Sellafield&quot; concert with Greenpeace to protest a nuclear fuel reprocessing plant. Events in Sarajevo during the Bosnian War inspired their song with Brian Eno called &quot;Miss Sarajevo&quot;, which they debuted at a September 1995 Pavarotti &amp; Friends concert to benefit the War Child charity. U2 fulfilled a 1993 promise to play in Sarajevo during the PopMart Tour in 1997. In May 1998, they performed in Belfast to promote Northern Ireland&#x27;s referendum over the Good Friday Agreement, which ended the Troubles. During the show, Bono brought Northern Irish political leaders David Trimble and John Hume on stage to shake hands; the referendum ultimately was passed. Later that year, all proceeds from the release of the &quot;Sweetest Thing&quot; single went towards supporting the Chernobyl Children&#x27;s Project.
The band dedicated their 2000 song &quot;Walk On&quot; to Burma&#x27;s pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who had been under house arrest since 1989. In late 2003, Bono and the Edge participated in the South Africa HIV/AIDS awareness 46664 series of concerts hosted by Nelson Mandela. In 2005, the band played the Live 8 concert in London, which Geldof helped stage on the 20th anniversary of Live Aid to support the Make Poverty History campaign. The band and manager Paul McGuinness were awarded Amnesty International&#x27;s Ambassador of Conscience Award for their work in promoting human rights.

Since 2000, Bono&#x27;s campaigning has included Jubilee 2000 with Geldof, Muhammad Ali, and others to promote the cancellation of third-world debt during the Great Jubilee. In January 2002, Bono co-founded the multinational NGO DATA, with the aim of improving the social, political, and financial state of Africa. He continued his campaigns for debt and HIV/AIDS relief into June 2002 by making high-profile visits to Africa. Product Red, a for-profit licensed brand seeking to raise money for the Global Fund, was co-founded by Bono in 2006. The ONE Campaign, originally the US counterpart of Make Poverty History, was shaped by his efforts and vision.

In November 2005, the Edge and producer Bob Ezrin helped introduce Music Rising, an initiative to replace instruments for musicians in the New Orleans area impacted by Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita. In 2006, U2 collaborated with Green Day to record a remake of the song &quot;The Saints Are Coming&quot; by the Skids to benefit Music Rising. A live version of the song recorded at the Louisiana Superdome was released on the single.

U2 have provided funding for music education on several occasions. In 2010, an education programme for children called Music Generation was established from funds provided by U2 and the Ireland Funds. The band initially gave for the programme&#x27;s creation, followed by donations of in 2015 and some of their earnings from their Joshua Tree Tour 2017. The programme provided tuition to 116,000 children in 2023. Following U2&#x27;s residency at Sphere in the Las Vegas Valley, the University of Nevada, Las Vegas&#x27;s College of Fine Arts announced in January 2025 that the band had made a donation of $300,000 to the U2:UV Music Scholarship and Experiential Fund for music education.

In April 2020, the group donated to purchase personal protective equipment for Irish healthcare workers working during the COVID-19 pandemic. The band also donated to ease the impact of the pandemic on the music industry, including a donation to the Songs from an Empty Room fundraiser. In January 2025, U2 donated $1 million to FireAid to benefit those affected by the Southern California wildfires.

U2 were honoured with the Innovator Award at the 3rd iHeartRadio Music Awards in April 2016 for their &quot;impact on popular culture and commitment to social causes&quot;. Bono has received many awards for his music and activism, including the Legion of Honour from the French Government in 2003, &quot;Time&quot;″s Person of the Year for 2005 (along with Bill Gates and Melinda Gates), and an honorary British knighthood in 2007. Some news sources have questioned the efficacy of Bono&#x27;s campaign to relieve debt and provide assistance to Africa.

== Other projects and collaborations ==
The members of U2 have undertaken side projects, sometimes in collaboration with some of their bandmates. In 1985, Bono recorded the song &quot;In a Lifetime&quot; with the Irish band Clannad. The Edge recorded a solo soundtrack album for the film &quot;Captive&quot;, which was released in 1986 and included a vocal performance by Sinéad O&#x27;Connor on the song &quot;Heroine&quot; that predates her own debut album by a year. For Robbie Robertson&#x27;s 1987 self-titled solo album, U2 performed on the songs &quot;Sweet Fire of Love&quot; and &quot;Testimony&quot;. Bono and the Edge wrote the song &quot;She&#x27;s a Mystery to Me&quot; for Roy Orbison, which was featured on his 1989 album &quot;Mystery Girl&quot;. In 1990, Bono and the Edge provided the original score to the Royal Shakespeare Company London&#x27;s stage adaptation of &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;. One track, &quot;Alex Descends into Hell for a Bottle of Milk/Korova 1&quot;, was on the B-side to &quot;The Fly&quot; single. That same year, Mullen produced and played drums on &quot;Put &#x27;Em Under Pressure&quot;, a song for the Ireland national team for the 1990 FIFA World Cup; the song topped the Irish charts for 13 weeks. For the 1995 James Bond film &quot;GoldenEye&quot;, Bono and the Edge wrote the title song &quot;GoldenEye&quot;, which was performed by Tina Turner. Clayton and Mullen reworked the &quot;Theme from &quot;Mission: Impossible&quot;&quot; for the . Bono and the Edge ventured into theatre again by writing the music and lyrics for the Broadway musical &quot;Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark&quot;, which opened in June 2011. Bono and the Edge collaborated with Dutch DJ Martin Garrix on the 2021 track &quot;We Are the People&quot;, which served as the official song of the UEFA Euro 2020 tournament.

In addition to collaborating with fellow musicians, U2 have worked with several authors. American author William S. Burroughs had a guest appearance in U2&#x27;s video for &quot;Last Night on Earth&quot; shortly before he died. Video footage of him reading his poem &quot;Thanksgiving Prayer&quot; was used during a Zoo TV Tour television special. Other collaborators include Allen Ginsberg and Salman Rushdie. Lyrics from Rushdie&#x27;s 1999 book &quot;The Ground Beneath Her Feet&quot; were adapted by U2 into the song &quot;The Ground Beneath Her Feet&quot;, which was one of three tracks the group contributed to &quot;The Million Dollar Hotel&quot; movie soundtrack in 2000.

In April 2017, U2 were featured on a Kendrick Lamar song, &quot;XXX&quot;, from his album &quot;DAMN&quot;.

== Legacy ==
U2 have sold an estimated 150–170 million records worldwide, placing them among the best-selling music artists in history. The group&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot;, is one of the best-selling albums in the US (10 million copies shipped) and worldwide (25 million copies sold). With 52 million certified units by the RIAA, U2 rank as the 24th-highest-selling music artist in the US. U2 have eight albums that have reached number one in the US, the third-most of any group. They were the first group to attain number-one albums in the US in the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s. In the UK, the group have had seven number-one singles, tied for the 17th-most of any artist, and eleven number-one albums, tied for the 8th-most of any artist. The band&#x27;s 1,468 weeks spent on the UK music charts ranks 18th all-time. In their native Ireland, U2 hold the record for most number-one singles with 21, and they have 10 number-one albums.

In the 1980s, U2 &quot;dominated the alternative rock scene&quot;, according to cultural critic Kevin J. H. Dettmar. Similarly, in the next decade, they were one of the most famous alternative rock bands worldwide and among the highest-selling rock bands. In the 35-year history of &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Alternative Airplay chart, U2 holds records for most songs charted (42), most number ones in the 1980s (2, tied), and most number ones in the 1990s (6). Record sales declined in the 2000s and the music industry entered an age of often illegal digital downloading, but according to author Mat Snow, U2 prospered more than younger acts because of a loyal following that held an attachment to the album format. Snow said, &quot;Children of the album era as they were, U2 would never stop regarding the album as the core statement of their creativity&quot;, despite progressively decreasing sales, while he noted that live shows consequently became the group&#x27;s greatest source of revenue.

Based on data from &quot;Pollstar&quot;, U2 were the second-highest-grossing musical act from 1980 to 2022, earning in revenue from 26.178 million tickets sold. According to &quot;Billboard Boxscore&quot;, the band grossed in ticket sales from 1990 to 2016, second only to the Rolling Stones. U2 were the only group in the top 25 touring acts from 2000 to 2009 to sell out every show they played. According to &quot;Pollstar&quot;, the band grossed and sold 9,300,500 tickets from 255 shows played between 2010 and November 2019, earning the publication&#x27;s title of touring artist of the 2010s decade; U2 were the only artist to surpass grossed during that span. &quot;Forbes&quot; has named U2 the world&#x27;s annual highest-earning music artist a record five times. &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;″ 2020 Irish Rich List estimated the group&#x27;s collective wealth at .

U2 are regarded as one of the greatest pop-rock acts of all time. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed U2 at number 22 on its list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot;, while ranking Bono the 32nd-greatest singer, the Edge the 38th-greatest guitarist, and Mullen the 96th-greatest drummer. The magazine placed Bono and the Edge at number 35 on its list of the &quot;100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time&quot;. In 2004, &quot;Q&quot; ranked U2 as the fourth-biggest band in a list compiled based on album sales, time spent on the UK charts, and largest audience for a headlining show. VH1 placed U2 at number 19 on its 2010 list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot;. In 2010, eight of U2&#x27;s songs appeared on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s updated list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;, with &quot;One&quot; ranking the highest at number 36. Five of the group&#x27;s twelve studio albums were ranked on the magazine&#x27;s 2012 list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;—&quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; placed the highest at number 27. Reflecting on the band&#x27;s popularity and worldwide impact, Jeff Pollack for &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; said, &quot;like the Who before them, U2 wrote songs about things that were important and resonated with their audience&quot;. &quot;Houston Press&quot; journalist John Seaborn Gray attributed U2&#x27;s pioneering impact on pop-rock music largely to the Edge&#x27;s unique guitar style.
U2 received their first Grammy Award in 1988 for &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot;, and they have won 22 in total out of 46 nominations, more than any other group. These include Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group, Album of the Year, Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Rock Album. In the UK, U2 have received 7 Brit Awards out of 20 nominations from the British Phonographic Industry, including five wins for Best International Group. They were the first international group to win the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music. In Ireland, U2 have won 14 Meteor Awards since the awards began in 2001. Other awards won by the band and their members include one American Music Award, six MTV Video Music Awards, eleven Q Awards, two Juno Awards, five NME Awards, and two Golden Globe Awards. The band were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in March 2005. In 2006, all four members of the band received ASCAP awards for writing the songs &quot;I Still Haven&#x27;t Found What I&#x27;m Looking For&quot; and &quot;Vertigo&quot;. In 2022, the group received Kennedy Center Honors for their contributions in the performing arts, making them only the fifth musical group to be so honoured.

<text>β-Lactam antibiotics (&quot;beta&quot;-lactam antibiotics) are antibiotics that contain a β-lactam ring in their chemical
structure. This includes penicillin derivatives (penams), cephalosporins and cephamycins (cephems), monobactams, carbapenems and carbacephems. Most β-lactam antibiotics work by inhibiting cell wall biosynthesis in the bacterial organism and are the most widely used group of antibiotics. Until 2003, when measured by sales, more than half of all commercially available antibiotics in use were β-lactam compounds. The first β-lactam antibiotic discovered, penicillin, was isolated from a strain of &quot;Penicillium rubens&quot; (named as &quot;Penicillium notatum&quot; at the time).

Bacteria often develop resistance to β-lactam antibiotics by synthesizing a β-lactamase, an enzyme that attacks the β-lactam ring. To overcome this resistance, β-lactam antibiotics can be given with β-lactamase inhibitors such as clavulanic acid.

==Medical use==
β-Lactam antibiotics are indicated for the prevention and treatment of bacterial infections caused by susceptible organisms. At first, β-lactam antibiotics were mainly active only against gram-positive bacteria, yet the recent development of broad-spectrum β-lactam antibiotics active against various gram-negative organisms has increased their usefulness.

In uninflamed (normal) brain meninges, the penetration of beta-lactam antibiotics is low, at 0.15 of AUCCSF/AUCS ratio (the ratio of area under curve of cerebrosopinal fluid against area under curve of serum).

==Adverse effects==

===Adverse drug reactions===
Common adverse drug reactions for the β-lactam antibiotics include diarrhea, nausea, rash, urticaria, superinfection (including candidiasis).

Infrequent adverse effects include fever, vomiting, erythema, dermatitis, angioedema, pseudomembranous colitis.

Pain and inflammation at the injection site is also common for parenterally administered β-lactam antibiotics.

===Allergy/hypersensitivity===
Immunologically mediated adverse reactions to any β-lactam antibiotic may occur in up to 10% of patients receiving that agent (a small fraction of which are truly IgE-mediated allergic reactions, see amoxicillin rash). Anaphylaxis will occur in approximately 0.01% of patients. There is perhaps a 5–10% cross-sensitivity between penicillin-derivatives, cephalosporins, and carbapenems; but this figure has been challenged by various investigators.

Nevertheless, the risk of cross-reactivity is sufficient to warrant the contraindication of all β-lactam antibiotics in patients with a history of severe allergic reactions (urticaria, anaphylaxis, interstitial nephritis) to any β-lactam antibiotic. Rarely, allergic reactions have been triggered by exposure from kissing and sexual contact with a partner who is taking these antibiotics.

A Jarisch–Herxheimer reaction may occur after initial treatment of a spirochetal infection such as syphilis with a β-lactam antibiotic.

==Mechanism of action==

===Inhibition of cell wall synthesis===


β-Lactam antibiotics are bactericidal, and act by inhibiting the synthesis of the peptidoglycan layer of bacterial cell walls. The peptidoglycan layer is important for cell wall structural integrity, especially in gram-positive organisms, being the outermost and primary component of the wall. The final transpeptidation step in the synthesis of the peptidoglycan is facilitated by -transpeptidases, also known as penicillin binding proteins (PBPs). PBPs vary in their affinity for penicillin and other β-lactam antibiotics. The number of PBPs varies between bacterial species.

β-Lactam antibiotics are analogues of -alanyl--alanine—the terminal amino acid residues on the precursor NAM/NAG-peptide subunits of the nascent peptidoglycan layer. The structural similarity between β-lactam antibiotics and -alanyl--alanine facilitates their binding to the active site of PBPs. The β-lactam nucleus of the molecule irreversibly binds to (acylates) the Ser403 residue of the PBP active site. This irreversible inhibition of the PBPs prevents the final crosslinking (transpeptidation) of the nascent peptidoglycan layer, disrupting cell wall synthesis.
β-Lactam antibiotics block not only the division of bacteria, including cyanobacteria, but also the division of cyanelles, the photosynthetic organelles of the glaucophytes, and the division of chloroplasts of bryophytes. In contrast, they have no effect on the plastids of the highly developed vascular plants. This is supporting the endosymbiotic theory and indicates an evolution of plastid division in land plants.

Under normal circumstances, peptidoglycan precursors signal a reorganisation of the bacterial cell wall and, as a consequence, trigger the activation of autolytic cell wall hydrolases. Inhibition of cross-linkage by β-lactams causes a build-up of peptidoglycan precursors, which triggers the digestion of existing peptidoglycan by autolytic hydrolases without the production of new peptidoglycan. As a result, the bactericidal action of β-lactam antibiotics is further enhanced.

===Guanine oxidation===
Another possibility that has been proposed to account for much of the cytotoxicity of β-lactams focuses on the oxidation of the guanine nucleotide in the bacterial nucleotide pool. The incorporation of oxidized guanine nucleotide into DNA could cause cytotoxicity. Bacterial cytotoxicity could arise from incomplete repair of closely spaced 8-oxo-2&#x27;-deoxyguanosine lesions in the DNA resulting in double-strand breaks.

==Potency==

Two structural features of β-lactam antibiotics have been correlated with their antibiotic potency. The first is known as &quot;Woodward&#x27;s parameter&quot;, &quot;h&quot;, and is the height (in angstroms) of the pyramid formed by the nitrogen atom of the β-lactam as the apex and the three adjacent carbon atoms as the base. The second is called &quot;Cohen&#x27;s parameter&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, and is the distance between the carbon atom of the carboxylate and the oxygen atom of the β-lactam carbonyl. This distance is thought to correspond to the distance between the carboxylate-binding site and the oxyanion hole of the PBP enzyme. The best antibiotics are those with higher &quot;h&quot; values (more reactive to hydrolysis) and lower &quot;c&quot; values (better binding to PBPs).

==Modes of resistance==
By definition, all β-lactam antibiotics have a β-lactam ring in their structure. The effectiveness of these antibiotics relies on their ability to reach the PBP intact and their ability to bind to the PBP. Hence, there are two main modes of bacterial resistance to β-lactams: enzymatic hydrolysis of the β-lactam ring and possession of altered penicillin-binding proteins.

===Enzymatic hydrolysis of the β-lactam ring===
If the bacterium produces the enzyme β-lactamase or the enzyme penicillinase, the enzyme will hydrolyse the β-lactam ring of the antibiotic, rendering the antibiotic ineffective. (An example of such an enzyme is New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1, discovered in 2009.) The genes encoding these enzymes may be inherently present on the bacterial chromosome or may be acquired via plasmid transfer (plasmid-mediated resistance), and β-lactamase gene expression may be induced by exposure to β-lactams.

The production of a β-lactamase by a bacterium does not necessarily rule out all treatment options with β-lactam antibiotics. In some instances, β-lactam antibiotics may be co-administered with a β-lactamase inhibitor. For example, Augmentin (FGP) is made of amoxicillin (a β-lactam antibiotic) and clavulanic acid (a β-lactamase inhibitor). The clavulanic acid is designed to overwhelm all β-lactamase enzymes, and effectively serve as an antagonist so that the amoxicillin is not affected by the β-lactamase enzymes. Another β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combination is piperacillin/tazobactam with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity that includes gram-positive and -negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The addition of tazobactam to piperacillin has enhanced its stability against a wide range of β-lactamase enzymes including some Extended-Spectrum β-lactamases.

Other β-lactamase inhibitors such as boronic acids are being studied in which they irreversibly bind to the active site of β-lactamases. This is a benefit over clavulanic acid and similar β-lactam competitors, because they cannot be hydrolysed, and therefore rendered useless. Extensive research is currently being done to develop tailored boronic acids to target different isozymes of beta-lactamases.

However, in all cases where infection with β-lactamase-producing bacteria is suspected, the choice of a suitable β-lactam antibiotic should be carefully considered prior to treatment. In particular, choosing appropriate β-lactam antibiotic therapy is of utmost importance against organisms which harbor some level of β-lactamase expression. In this case, failure to use the most appropriate β-lactam antibiotic therapy at the onset of treatment could result in selection for bacteria with higher levels of β-lactamase expression, thereby making further efforts with other β-lactam antibiotics more difficult.

In the context of medical pharmacology, penicillins, cephalosporins, and carbapenems, while all have the β-lactam ring that serves as the fundamental structure, also have an auxiliary ring that carries a carboxylate group that is positioned on the same side as the carbonyl group within the β-lactam ring, and, as such, this structural configuration is critical to their antimicrobial activity. Bacterial resistance to these antibiotics primarily occurs through the production of β-lactamases, enzymes that hydrolyze the amide bond of the β-lactam ring, thereby eliminating the antimicrobial activity of these antibiotics. This resistance mechanism underscores the importance of the structural integrity of the β-lactam ring for the antibiotic&#x27;s function. The color change from colorless or light yellow to amber or even red in an aqueous solution of a β-lactam antibiotic can denote β-lactamase hydrolysis of amide bonds in the β-lactam ring. This is often observed with a chromogenic β-lactamase substrate like ceftriaxone, merapenem, or nitrocefin, that undergoes a distinctive color change from yellow to red as the amide bond in the β-lactam ring is hydrolyzed by β-lactamase. This color change is a visual indicator of the presence and activity of β-lactamase enzymes, which are responsible for conferring resistance to β-lactam antibiotics in many bacterial species. The hydrolysis of the β-lactam ring by β-lactamase enzymes renders the antibiotic ineffective, thereby allowing the bacteria to survive in the presence of the antibiotic. Some β-lactam antibiotics like ceftriaxone and meropenem are known to be relatively unstable in solution, especially when stored for extended periods, and degrade in an aqueous solution even without the presence of β-lactamase. For ceftriaxone, the color of solutions can range from light yellow to amber, depending on the length of storage, concentration, and diluent used. A study found that meropenem concentrations dropped to 90% of the initial concentration at 7.4 hours at 22°C and 5.7 hours at 33°C, indicating degradation over time.

===Possession of altered penicillin-binding proteins===
As a response to the use of β-lactams to control bacterial infections, some bacteria have evolved penicillin binding proteins with novel structures. β-Lactam antibiotics cannot bind as effectively to these altered PBPs, and, as a result, the β-lactams are less effective at disrupting cell wall synthesis. Notable examples of this mode of resistance include methicillin-resistant &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; (MRSA) and penicillin-resistant &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot;. Altered PBPs do not necessarily rule out all treatment options with β-lactam antibiotics.

==Nomenclature==
β-Lactams are classified according to their core ring structures.
* β-Lactams fused to saturated five-membered rings:
** β-Lactams containing thiazolidine rings are named penams.
** β-Lactams containing pyrrolidine rings are named carbapenams.
** β-Lactams fused to oxazolidine rings are named oxapenams or clavams.
* β-Lactams fused to unsaturated five-membered rings:
** β-Lactams containing 2,3-dihydrothiazole rings are named penems.
** β-Lactams containing 2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrrole rings are named carbapenems.
* β-Lactams fused to unsaturated six-membered rings:
** β-Lactams containing 3,6-dihydro-2H-1,3-thiazine rings are named cephems.
** β-Lactams containing 1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyridine rings are named carbacephems.
** β-Lactams containing 3,6-dihydro-2H-1,3-oxazine rings are named oxacephems.
* β-Lactams not fused to any other ring are named monobactams.
By convention, the bicyclic β-lactams are numbered starting with the position occupied by sulfur in the penams and cephems, regardless of which atom it is in a given class. That is, position 1 is always adjacent to the β-carbon of β-lactam ring. The numbering continues clockwise from position one until the β-carbon of β-lactam is reached, at which point numbering continues counterclockwise around the lactam ring to number the remaining to carbons. For example, the nitrogen atom of all bicyclic β-lactams fused to five-membered rings is labelled position 4, as it is in penams, while in cephems, the nitrogen is position 5.

The numbering of monobactams follows that of the IUPAC; the nitrogen atom is position 1, the carbonyl carbon is 2, the α-carbon is 3, and the β-carbon 4.

==Biosynthesis==
To date, two distinct methods of biosynthesizing the β-lactam core of this family of antibiotics have been discovered. The first pathway discovered was that of the penams and cephems. This path begins with a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), ACV synthetase (ACVS), which generates the linear tripeptide δ-(-α-aminoadipyl)--cysteine--valine (ACV). ACV is oxidatively cyclized (two cyclizations by a single enzyme) to bicyclic intermediate isopenicillin N by isopenicillin N synthase (IPNS) to form the penam core structure. Various transamidations lead to the different natural penicillins.

The biosynthesis of cephems branch off at isopenicillin N by an oxidative ring expansion to the cephem core. As with the penams, the variety of cephalosporins and cephamycins come from different transamidations, as is the case for the penicillins.

While the ring closure in penams and cephems is between positions 1 and 4 of the β-lactam and is oxidative, the clavams and carbapenems have their rings closed between positions 1 and 2 of the ring. β-lactam synthetases are responsible for these cyclizations, and the carboxylate of the open-ring substrates is activated by ATP. In clavams, the β-lactam is formed prior to the second ring; in carbapenems, the β-lactam ring is closed second in sequence.

The biosynthesis of the β-lactam ring of tabtoxin mirrors that of the clavams and carbapenems. The closure of the lactam ring in the other monobactams, such as sulfazecin and the nocardicins, may involve a third mechanism involving inversion of configuration at the β-carbon.

<text>Local government is a generic term for the lowest tiers of governance or public administration within a particular sovereign state.

Local governments typically constitute a subdivision of a higher-level political or administrative unit, such as a nation or state. Local governments generally act within the powers and functions assigned to them by law or directives of a higher level of government. In federal states, local government generally comprises a third or fourth level of government, whereas in unitary states, local government usually occupies the second or third level of government.

The institutions of local government vary greatly between countries, and even where similar arrangements exist, country-specific terminology often varies. Common designated names for different types of local government entities include counties, districts, cities, townships, towns, boroughs, parishes, municipalities, municipal corporations, shires, villages, and local government areas. The same term may be used in different countries to refer to local governance institutions with vastly different institutional features, powers, or functions.

In addition to general-purpose local governments, some countries have special-purpose local governments (special districts), such as independent school districts, elected water boards, or local service districts.

Although there is no single, commonly accepted definition of the term, the most precise definition of local governments is provided by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which divides the general government sector into three sub-sectors (central, state, and local government) and defines local governments as &quot;institutional units whose fiscal, legislative, and executive authority extends over the smallest geographical areas distinguished for administrative and political purposes.&quot;

The IMF further notes that local governments &quot;typically provide a wide range of services to local residents,&quot; while &quot;the scope of their authority is generally much less than that of central government or state governments, and they may or may not be entitled to levy taxes.&quot; They are often heavily dependent on grants (transfers) from higher levels of government, and they may also act, to some extent, as agents of central or regional governments. They should also be able to appoint their own officers, independently of external administrative control. Even when local governments act as agents of central or state governments to some extent, they can be treated as a separate level of government, provided they are also able to raise and spend some funds on their own initiative and own responsibility.&quot;

Other definitions for local governments are less prescriptive and emphasize the political or representative nature of local governments. For instance, OECD defines local governments as &quot;decentralized entities whose governance bodies are elected through universal suffrage and which has general responsibilities and some autonomy with respect to budget, staff and assets.&quot; The Local Public Sector Alliance defines local government institutions as &quot;a corporate body (or institutional unit) that performs one or more public sector functions within a [local] jurisdiction that has adequate political, administrative, and fiscal autonomy and authority to respond to the needs and priorities of its constituents&quot;.

Questions regarding the empowerment of local government institutions, the structure and nature of local political leadership, and the extent of local self-governance and municipal autonomy are key questions of public administration and governance. Local elections are held in many countries.

==Africa==
=== Egypt ===
Egypt has a centralised system of local government officially called local administration as it is a branch of the Executive. The country is divided into 27 governorates ( &#x27;; ; genitive case: ; plural: &#x27;), the top tier of local administration. A governorate is administered by a governor, who is appointed by the President of Egypt and serves at the president&#x27;s discretion.

Governors have the civilian rank of minister and report directly to the prime minister, who chairs the Board of Governors and meets with them on a regular basis. The Minister of Local Development coordinates the governors and their governorate&#x27;s budgets.

===Mali===

In recent years, Mali has undertaken an ambitious decentralization program, which involves the capital district of Bamako, seven regions subdivided into 46 cercles, and 682 rural community districts (communes). The state retains an advisory role in administrative and fiscal matters, and it provides technical support, coordination, and legal recourse to these levels. Opportunities for direct political participation, and increased local responsibility for development have been improved.

In August–September 1998, elections were held for urban council members, who subsequently elected their mayors. In May/June 1999, citizens of the communes elected their communal council members for the first time. Female voter turnout was about 70% of the total, and observers considered the process open and transparent. With mayors, councils, and boards in place at the local level, newly elected officials, civil society organizations, decentralized technical services, private sector interests, other communes, and donor groups began partnering to further development.

Eventually, the cercles will be reinstituted (formerly grouping arrondissements) with a legal and financial basis of their own. Their councils will be chosen by and from members of the communal councils. The regions, at the highest decentralized level, will have a similar legal and financial autonomy, and will comprise a number of cercles within their geographical boundaries. Mali needs to build capacity at these levels, especially to mobilize and manage financial resources.

=== Nigeria ===
Nigeria as a federal republic operates three tiers of government: federal (or central), states 
and local government. The country&#x27;s constitution provides for each local government (which exists in a single tier countrywide), and its development areas and autonomous communities created by individual state legislation to have democratically elected local government heads. There is a ministry (or bureau) of local government and chieftaincy affairs in each state charged with the responsibility of administration at that level. Nigeria has a total of 774 Local Government Areas 
(LGAs).

===South Africa===
South Africa has a two-tiered local government system comprising local municipalities which fall into district municipalities, and metropolitan municipalities which span both tiers of local government.

==Asia==

===Afghanistan===
Afghanistan was traditionally divided into provinces governed by centrally appointed governors with considerable autonomy in local affairs. There are currently 34 provinces. During the Soviet occupation and the development of country-wide resistance, local areas came increasingly under the control of mujaheddin groups that were largely independent of any higher authority; local commanders, in some instances, asserted a measure of independence also from the mujaheddin leadership in Pakistan, establishing their own systems of local government, collecting revenues, running educational and other facilities, and even engaging in local negotiations. Mujaheddin groups retained links with the Peshawar parties to ensure access to weapons that were doled out to the parties by the government of Pakistan for distribution to fighters inside Afghanistan.

The Taliban set up a shura (assembly), made up of senior Taliban members and important tribal from the area. Each shura made laws and collected taxes locally. The Taliban set up a provisional government for the whole of Afghanistan, but it did not exercise central control over the local shuras.

The process of setting up the transitional government in June 2002 by the Loya Jirga took many steps involving local government. First, at the district and municipal level, traditional shura councils met to pick electors—persons who cast ballots for Loya Jirga delegates. Each district or municipality had to choose a predetermined number of electors, based on the size of its population. The electors then traveled to regional centers and cast ballots, to choose from amongst themselves a smaller number of loya jirga delegates— according to allotted numbers assigned to each district. The delegates then took part in the Loya Jirga.

The warlords who rule various regions of the country exert local control. The transitional government is attempting to integrate local governing authorities with the central government, but it lacks the loyalty from the warlords necessary to its governing authority. More traditional elements of political authority—such as Sufi networks, royal lineage, clan strength, age-based wisdom, and the like—still exist and play a role in Afghan society. Karzai is relying on these traditional sources of authority in his challenge to the warlords and older Islamist leaders. The deep ethnic, linguistic, sectarian, tribal, racial, and regional cleavages present in the country create what is called &quot;Qawm&quot; identity, emphasizing the local over higher-order formations. Qawm refers to the group to which the individual considers himself to belong, whether a subtribe, village, valley, or neighborhood. Local governing authority relies upon these forms of identity and loyalty.

===Armenia===

Armenia is subdivided into eleven administrative divisions. Of these, ten are provinces, known as &quot;marzer&quot; () or in the singular form &quot;marz&quot; () in Armenian.

===Azerbaijan===

Azerbaijan is administratively divided into the following subdivisions:
*59 districts (&quot;rayonlar&quot;; sing.– &quot;rayon&quot;), 
*11 cities (&quot;şəhərlər&quot;; sing.– &quot;şəhər&quot;), 
*1 autonomous republic (&quot;muxtar respublika&quot;), which itself contains:
**7 districts
**1 city

The rayons are further divided into municipalities (&quot;Bələdiyyə&quot;).

===Bangladesh===

Bangladesh is divided into eight administrative divisions, each named after their respective divisional headquarters: Barisal, Chittagong, Dhaka, Khulna, Rajshahi, Sylhet, Rangpur and Mymensingh Division.

Divisions are divided into &quot;zila&quot;. There are 64 zila in Bangladesh, each further divided into &quot;upazila&quot; or &quot;thana&quot;. The area within each police station, except for those in metropolitan areas, is divided into several &quot;unions&quot;, with each union consisting of multiple villages. In the metropolitan areas, police stations are divided into wards, which are further divided into &quot;mahallas&quot;. There are no directly elected officials at the divisional or district levels, although elected chairs of subdistricts also sit on district councils. Direct elections are held for each union (or ward), electing a chairperson and a number of members. In 1997, a parliamentary act was passed to reserve three seats (out of 12) in every union for female candidates.

Dhaka is the capital and largest city of Bangladesh. The cities with a city corporation, having mayoral elections, include Dhaka South, Dhaka North, Chittagong, Khulna, Sylhet, Rajshahi, Barisal, Rangpur, Comilla and Gazipur. Other major cities, these and other municipalities electing a mayor and councilors for each ward, include Mymensingh, Gopalganj, Jessore, Bogra, Dinajpur, Saidapur, Narayanganj, Naogaon and Rangamati. Both the municipal heads are elected for a span of five years.

=== Brunei Darussalam ===
The administrative divisions of Brunei mainly consist of &quot;daerah&quot;, &quot;mukim&quot; and &quot;kampung&quot; or &quot;kampong&quot;. They are organised hierarchically, with &quot;daerah&quot; being the first level and &quot;kampong&quot; the third level. All the administrative divisions are under direct governance of the government through the Ministry of Home Affairs. There are four districts in Brunei: Brunei-Muara, Belait, Tutong and Temburong. The administrative level of mukim lies below the district. At present, there are 38 mukims, with 17 in Brunei-Muara, 8 in Tutong, 8 in Belait and 5 in Temburong District. A mukim is headed by a penghulu. A village (Malay: kampung or kampong) is the lowest administrative level in Brunei and headed by a ketua kampong or village head. Its population varies from a few hundreds to tens of thousands.

===Cambodia===

*Cities: 71 single-level urban municipalities, usually with populations exceeding 20,000 residents.
*Local councils: 141 single-level urban or rural municipalities, usually with populations between 2,000 and 20,000.
*Regional Councils: 54 bi-level municipalities which govern multiple rural communities located in relative geographic vicinity. The number of residents in the individual communities usually does not exceed 2000. There are no clear limits to the population and land area size of Israeli regional councils.
*Industrial councils: Two single-level municipalities which govern large and complex industrial areas outside cities. The local industrial councils are Tefen in Upper Galilee (north of Karmiel) and Ramat Hovav in the Negev (south of Beer Sheva).

===Japan===
Since the Meiji restoration, Japan has had a local government system based on prefectures. The national government oversees much of the country. Municipal governments were historical villages. Now mergers are common for cost effective administration. There are 47 prefectures. They have two main responsibilities. One is mediation between national and municipal governments. The other is area wide administration.

===Kazakhstan===
===Korea, North===
===Korea, South===
===Malaysia===
Local government is the lowest level in the system of government in Malaysia—after federal and state. Councillors are not elected in local-level elections which have been abolished in 1976, but rather appointed by state governments. It has the power to collect taxes (in the form of assessment tax), to create laws and rules (in the form of by-laws) and grants licenses and permits for any trade in its area of jurisdiction, in addition to providing basic amenities, collecting and managing waste and garbage as well as planning and developing the area under its jurisdiction.

===Myanmar===

And there are total 6,743 wards are formed under these 753 local levels. These local government are ruled by local leaders and the Mayor is the supreme of each local government which is elected every 5 (Five) year by local public.

===Pakistan===
Local government is the third tier of government in Pakistan, after Federal Government and Provincial Government. There are three types of administrative unit of local government in Pakistan:

* District Government Administrations
* Town Municipal Administrations
* Union Council Administrations

There are over five thousand local governments in Pakistan. Since 2001, these have been led by democratically elected local councils, each headed by a Nazim (the word means &quot;supervisor&quot; in Urdu, but is sometimes translated as Mayor). Some districts, incorporating large metropolitan areas, are called City Districts. A City District may contain subdivisions called Towns and Union Councils. Council elections are held every four years. District Governments also include a District Coordination Officer (DCO), who is a civil servant in-charge of all devolved departments. Currently, the Powers of Nazim are also held by the DCO.

===Palestinian Authority===
Local government in the Palestinian National Authority-controlled areas are divided into three main groups: Municipal councils, village council and local development committees.
* Municipality (Palestinian Authority): Depends on size of locality. Localities that serve as the centers of governorates and populations over 15,000 have 15-member councils. Localities with populations over 15,000 residents have 13-member councils and localities with populations between 4,000 and 15,000 have 9-member councils.
* Village Council (Palestinian Authority): Localities with populations between 800 and 1,500 have 3-member councils while those between 1,500 and −4,000 residents have 7-member councils.

===Philippines===

The Local Government Code of 1991 provides for the three levels of Local Government Units or LGUs in the Philippines: (1) the province (2) city and municipality, and (3) the barangay. The country remains a unitary state and the National Government continues to have strong influence over local government units.

A province is led by a governor along with the &quot;Sangguniang Panlalawigan&quot; (Provincial Council) composed of board members. A mayor leads a city or municipality while the &quot;Sangguniang Panlungsod&quot; (City Council) and the &quot;Sangguniang Bayan&quot; (Municipal Council) constitute the legislative branches of a city and municipality, respectively. A barangay is headed by the Barangay Captain and the Barangay Council. Barangays can be further divided into puroks and sitios but their leadership is unelected.

The 1987 Philippine Constitution also provides for the existence of autonomous regions. The Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) is the only autonomous region in the Philippines. There was an attempt to institute an autonomous region in the Cordillera, but that failed and instead the Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR) was established.

Local governments have limited taxing authority. Most of their funds come from the national government via the Internal Revenue Allotment

===Saudi Arabia===
There are three levels of local government in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia: the city council, the municipal council and the municipality.

The city council is the highest level of local government. The municipal councils began in 2005 and is the second level of local government. The municipality is the third level of local government. There are 178 municipalities across the kingdom. The first began in Jeddah during the Othmanic period. Each municipality is run by its city&#x27;s mayor. Collectively, the kingdom&#x27;s municipalities make up the Ministry of Municipality and Rural Affairs (MoMRA).

===Sri Lanka===
===Syria===
===Taiwan===
The Republic of China government in Taiwan consists of special municipality governments, provincial city governments and county governments for their local governments. They also have councils in each of those three local government levels.

===Tajikistan===
===Thailand===
===Turkey===
Turkey has two levels of local government; provinces (Turkish: iller) and districts (Turkish: ilçeler).

The territory of Turkey is subdivided into 81 provinces for administrative purposes. The provinces are organized into 7 regions for census purposes; however, they do not represent an administrative structure. Each province is divided into districts, for a total of 957 districts.

===United Arab Emirates===
===Uzbekistan===
===Vietnam===
Vietnam has 3 levels of local government:
*First tier: municipalities (thành phố) and provinces (tỉnh)
*Second tier: provincial cities (thành phố), district-level towns (thị xã) and rural districts (huyện)

Each level has a People&#x27;s Committee (executive – up to third tier), a People&#x27;s Council (legislative – up to third tier) and a People&#x27;s Court (judiciary – up to second tier).

===Yemen===
==Europe==
===Albania===

Since its Declaration of Independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1912, Albania has reformed its internal divisions 21 times. Before the implementation of the 1998 Constitution, the primary division was into about 36 districts (), whose number, size, and importance varied over time. Following their abolishment in the year 2000, the counties were divided into urban () and rural municipalities () until the 2015 elections, when they were replaced by the current system.

Presently, Albania has 34 levels of local government :
* 12 counties (), sometimes known as prefectures () or administrative divisions
* 61 municipalities ()
* 373 administrative units (), sometimes known as communes (), which also oversee about 3,000 villages ()

The prefects who oversee each county are appointed by the central government, but the mayors of the municipalities and the local government councils are elected democratically.

===Andorra===
Andorra is formed by seven parishes (parròquies, singular – parròquia); Andorra la Vella, Canillo, Encamp, La Massana, Escaldes-Engordany, Ordino, Sant Julià de Lòria.

Some parishes have a further territorial subdivision. Ordino, La Massana and Sant Julià de Lòria are subdivided into &quot;quarts&quot; (quarters), while Canillo is subdivided into 10 &quot;veïnats&quot; (neighborhoods). Those mostly coincide with villages, which are found in all parishes. Each parish has its own elected mayor who is the nominal head of the local government known as a &quot;comú&quot; in Catalan.

===Belarus===

At the top level of administration, Belarus is divided into six &quot;regions&quot; and the city of Minsk, which has a special status being the capital of Belarus. Minsk is also the capital of Minsk Region.

At the second level, the regions are divided into &quot;raions&quot; (&quot;districts&quot;).

===Bulgaria===
Since the 1880s, the number of territorial management units in Bulgaria has varied from seven to 26. Between 1987 and 1999 the administrative structure consisted of nine provinces (&quot;oblasti&quot;, singular &quot;oblast&quot;). A new administrative structure was adopted in parallel with the decentralisation of the economic system. It includes 27 provinces and a metropolitan capital province (Sofia-Grad). All areas take their names from their respective capital cities. The provinces subdivide into 264 municipalities.

Municipalities are run by mayors, who are elected to four-year terms, and by directly elected municipal councils. Bulgaria is a highly centralised state, where the national Council of Ministers directly appoints regional governors and all provinces and municipalities are heavily dependent on it for funding.

===Croatia===
Croatia is divided into 20 counties and the capital city of Zagreb, the latter having the authority and legal status of a county and a city at the same time. The counties subdivide into 127 cities and 429 municipalities.

===Czech Republic===
The highest tier of local government in the Czech Republic are the thirteen regions (Czech: ) and the capital city of Prague. Each region has its own elected Regional Assembly (&quot;krajské zastupitelstvo&quot;) and &quot;hejtman&quot; (usually translated as hetman or governor). In Prague, their powers are executed by the city council and the mayor.

The regions are divided into seventy-six districts (&quot;okresy&quot;, singular &quot;okres&quot;) including three &quot;statutory cities&quot; (without Prague, which had special status). The districts lost most of their importance in 1999 in an administrative reform; they remain as territorial divisions and seats of various branches of state administration. A further reform in effect since January 2003 created 204 Municipalities with Extended Competence (obce s rozšířenou působností); also obce III. stupně – third-level municipalities, unofficially also called &quot;little districts&quot; (Czech: &#x27;malé okresy&#x27;) which took over most of the administration of the former district authorities. Some of these are further divided between Municipalities with Commissioned Local Authority (obce s pověřeným obecním úřadem, shortened to pověřená obec, pl. pověřené obce; &quot;second-level municipalities&quot;). In 2007 the borders of the districts were slightly adjusted, and 119 municipalities are now within different districts.

===Denmark===
For local government purposes, Denmark is divided into five regions (), with their most important area of responsibility being the public health service. They are also responsible for employment policies, while some regions are responsible for public mass transit. Regions are not financial independent as they rely entirely on central state funding (around 70%) and funding coming from the municipalities (around 30%). Regions are led by directly elected councils (&quot;regionsråd&quot;) consisting of 41 members each.

The regions are further divided into 98 municipalities (&quot;kommuner&quot;). Elections for the municipalities are held on the third Tuesday of November every four years.

===Estonia===
Estonia is divided into 79 municipalities (&quot;omavalitsus&quot;), and each municipality is a unit of self-government with its representative and executive bodies. Furthermore, the country is also divided into fifteen counties (), each of which were used to be led by a county governor (&quot;maavanem&quot;), who represents the national government at the regional level. This although changed with 2017 administrative reform.

===Finland===
The most important administrative layer of local government in Finland are the 311 municipalities, which may also call themselves towns or cities. They account for half of public spending. Spending is financed by municipal income tax, property tax, state subsidies, and other revenue.

In addition to municipalities, there are two intermediate levels of local government. Municipalities co-operate in seventy-four sub-regions and nineteen regions. These are governed by the member municipalities and have only limited powers. However, the autonomous province of Åland has a directly elected regional council, and the Sami people have a semi-autonomous Sami Domicile Area in Lapland for issues on language and culture.

===France===
According to its Constitution of 1958, France has 3 levels of local government:
*13 &quot;Régions&quot; (including Corsica) and 5 &quot;Régions d&#x27;outre-mer&quot; (Réunion, Martinique, Mayotte, Guadeloupe and French Guiana). Corsica is not referred to as a &quot;région&quot; but simply as a &quot;collectivité territoriale&quot;, that merely means &quot;local government area&quot;.
*96 &quot;départements&quot; and 5 &quot;départements d&#x27;outre-mer&quot; (Réunion, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Mayotte and French Guiana). Paris is both a commune and a département.
*There are 36,679 municipalities (in French: &quot;Communes&quot;).

However, in addition to the constitutional clauses of 1958, there now exist specificities:
*Intercommunalities are now a level of government between municipalities and departments.
*There exist 2 &quot;pays d&#x27;outre-mer&quot;: French Polynesia and New Caledonia. The expression &quot;pays d&#x27;outre-mer&quot; is convenient as it can be understood in French as both &quot;overseas country&quot; and &quot;overseas county/traditional area&quot; (as evidenced by Pays de la Loire that is a home région, not a home &quot;country&quot;). French Polynesia works as an autonomous &quot;région&quot;, whereas New Caledonia has a &quot;sui generis&quot; local government status with specific institutions and even more autonomy.

===Germany===
===Greece===
Since 1 January 2011, Greece consists of thirteen regions subdivided into a total of 325 municipalities and communities. The regions have their own elected governors and regional councils, however there are seven decentralized administrations, which group from one to three regions under a government-appointed general secretary. There is also one autonomous area, Mount Athos.

===Hungary===
For local government, Hungary is divided into 19 counties. In addition, the capital (&quot;főváros&quot;), Budapest, is independent of any county government

The counties are further subdivided into 174 subregions (&quot;kistérségek&quot;), and Budapest is its own subregion.

There are also 23 towns with county rights (singular &quot;megyei jogú város&quot;). The local authorities of these towns have extended powers, but these towns belong to the territory of the respective county instead of being independent territorial units.

===Iceland===
The Municipalities of Iceland are local administrative areas in Iceland that provide a number of services to their inhabitants such as kindergartens, elementary schools, waste management, social services, public housing, public transportation, services to senior citizens and handicapped people. They also govern zoning and can voluntarily take on additional functions if they have the budget for it. The autonomy of municipalities over their own matters is guaranteed by the constitution of Iceland.

The municipalities are governed by municipal councils which are directly elected every four years. The sizes of these councils vary from five members in the smallest municipalities to fifteen in the largest one. Most municipalities except for the very small ones hire an executive manager who may or may not be a member of the municipal council. These managers are usually referred to as mayors (&quot;bæjarstjóri / borgarstjóri&quot;) in the mostly urban municipalities but &quot;commune manager&quot; (&quot;sveitarstjóri&quot;) in the rural or mixed municipalities.

===Ireland===
 The Republic of Ireland&#x27;s local government is laid out by the Local Government Reform Act 2014. With a few exceptions, local government is two-tier. At the lowest level are the municipal, metropolitan or borough councils, which are elected during local elections. These councillors from the relevant county then together form the council, termed either County or City and County Councils. For example, the 4 municipal districts in Westmeath County each elect their own councils, who together form Westmeath County Council. Many functions are performed by the Chief Executive, who is appointed by the Minister for Local Government.

The exceptions to the above is the county of Dublin and the cities of Cork and Galway, the later two&#x27;s councils are directly elected with no lower council. Dublin county is made up of four local area authorities, each elected directly. There are thirty-one local authorities.

The main sources of funding for local government in Ireland are local property and motor tax revenues, payments from the Exchequer, charges for goods and services, and state grants.

===Isle of Man===

Local government on the Isle of Man is partly based on the ancient parishes. There are four types of local authorities: a borough corporation, town commissioners, village commissioners, and parish commissioners.

===Italy===
The Constitution of Italy defines three levels of local government:
*Regions: they were first acknowledged after the birth of the Italian republic in 1948. Numbering 20, they acquired a significant degree of autonomy after a constitutional reform was passed in 2001. Furthermore, 5 of them (namely Valle d&#x27;Aosta, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Trentino-Alto Adige, Sardinia and Sicily) have a special status and are given even more power than the 15 others.
*Provinces: they were the only local bodies in effect during the Kingdom of Italy (from the unification of Italy in 1861 to the birth of the Republic in 1948). Consequently, they used to serve many functions, but these were reduced as Regions absorbed more and more competences. Nowadays they number 107 and mostly care to roads, school buildings, and local zoning and planning. Finally, from 2015 onwards, 14 provinces officially became &quot;metropolitan cities&quot;.
*Communes: The Mayor and staff, caring for the needs of a single town or of a village and neighbouring minor towns or villages.

Major cities also have an extra tier of local government named &quot;Circoscrizione di Decentramento Comunale&quot; or, in some cities (e.g. Rome) &quot;Municipio&quot;.

===Latvia===
Latvia is a unitary state, currently divided into 110 municipalities () and 9 republican cities () with their own council.

===Liechtenstein===
Liechtenstein is divided into eleven municipalities (&quot;Gemeinden&quot; singular &quot;Gemeinde&quot;), most consisting of only a single town.

===Lithuania===

Lithuania has a three-tier division of local government: the country is divided into 10 counties (Lithuanian: singular – &quot;apskritis&quot;, plural – &quot;apskritys&quot;) that are further subdivided into 60 municipalities (Lithuanian: singular – &quot;savivaldybė&quot;, plural – &quot;savivaldybės&quot;) which consist of over 500 elderships (Lithuanian: singular – &quot;seniūnija&quot;, plural – &quot;seniūnijos&quot;).

The counties are ruled by county governors (Lithuanian: &quot;apskrities viršininkas&quot;) appointed by the central government, and effectively oversee the two lower tiers of local government.

Municipalities are the most important administrative unit of local government. Each municipality has its own government and council, with elections taking place every four years. The mayor, who is a member of the council, is elected directly by the residents in a majority vote. The council appoints elders to govern the elderships.

Elderships, numbering over 500, are the smallest units of local government. They provide public services such as registering births and deaths and identifying individuals or families in need of welfare.

===Malta===
Malta is a unitary city state divided into 68 municipalities (local councils), according to the constitution of the Malta.

===Netherlands===

The Netherlands has three tiers of local government: national, provincial, municipal and water board.

The Netherlands is divided into twelve provinces (&quot;provincie&quot;, pl. &quot;provincies&quot;). They form the tier of administration between the central government and the municipalities. Each province is governed by a provincial council, the States-Provincial (&quot;Provinciale Staten&quot;, abbr. to &quot;PS&quot;). Its members are elected every four years. The day-to-day management of the province is in the hands of the provincial executive, the States Deputed (&quot;Gedeputeerde Staten&quot;, abbr. to &quot;GS&quot;). Members of the executive are chosen by the provincial council. The size of the executive varies from one province to another. In Flevoland, the smallest of the Dutch provinces, it has four members, while most other provinces have six or seven. Meetings of the provincial executive are chaired by the King&#x27;s Commissioner (&quot;Commissaris van de Koning(in)&quot;, abbr. to &quot;CvdK&quot;). The King&#x27;s Commissioner is not elected by the residents of the province, but appointed by the Crown (the King and government ministers). The appointment is for six years and may be extended by a second term. The King&#x27;s Commissioner can be dismissed only by the Crown. King&#x27;s Commissioners play an important part in the appointment of municipal mayors. When a vacancy arises, the King&#x27;s Commissioner first asks the municipal council for its views as to a successor, then writes to the Minister of the Interior recommending a candidate.

Municipalities (&quot;gemeente&quot;, pl. &quot;gemeenten&quot;) form the lowest tier of government in the Netherlands, after the central government and the provinces. There are 415 of them (1 January 2012). The municipal council (&quot;gemeenteraad&quot;) is the highest authority in the municipality. Its members are elected every four years. The role of the municipal council is comparable to that of the board of an organisation or institution. Its main job is to decide the municipality&#x27;s broad policies and to oversee their implementation. The day-to-day administration of the municipality is in the hands of the municipal executive (&quot;college van burgemeester en wethouders&quot;, abbr. to &quot;(college van) B&amp;W)&quot;, made up of the mayor (&quot;burgemeester&quot;) and the aldermen (&quot;wethouder&quot;, pl. &quot;wethouders&quot;). The executive implements national legislation on matters such as social assistance, unemployment benefits and environmental management. It also bears primary responsibility for the financial affairs of the municipality and for its personnel policies. Aldermen are appointed by the council. Councillors can be chosen to act as aldermen. In that case, they lose their seats on the council and their places are taken by other representatives of the same political parties. Non-councillors can also be appointed. Unlike councillors and aldermen, mayors are not elected (not even indirectly), but are appointed by the Crown. Mayors chair both the municipal council and the executive. They have a number of statutory powers and responsibilities of their own. They are responsible for maintaining public order and safety within the municipality and frequently manage the municipality&#x27;s public relations. As Crown appointees, mayors also have some responsibility for overseeing the work of the municipality, its policies and relations with other government bodies. Although they are obliged to carry out the decisions of the municipal council and executive, they may recommend that the Minister of the Interior quash any decision that they believe to be contrary to the law or against the public interest. Mayors are invariably appointed for a period of six years. They can be dismissed only by the Crown and not by the municipal council.

Water boards (&quot;waterschap&quot; and &quot;hoogheemraadschap&quot;, pl. &quot;waterschappen&quot; and &quot;hoogheemraadschappen&quot;) are among the oldest government authorities in the Netherlands. They literally form the foundation of the whole Dutch system of local government; from time immemorial they have shouldered the responsibility for water management for the residents of their area. In polders this mainly involves regulating the water level. It has always been in the common interest to keep water out and polder residents have always had to work together. That is what led to the creation of water boards. The structure of the water boards varies, but they all have a general administrative body and an executive board (&quot;college van dijkgraaf en heemraden&quot;) consisting of a chairperson (&quot;dijkgraaf&quot;) and other members (&quot;(hoog)heemraad&quot;, pl. &quot;(hoog)heemraden&quot;). The chairperson also presides the general administrative body. This body consists of people representing the various categories of stakeholders: landholders, leaseholders, owners of buildings, companies and, since recently, all the residents as well. Importance and financial contribution decide how many representatives each category may delegate. Certain stakeholders (e.g. environmental organisations) may be given the power to appoint members. The general administrative body elects the executive board from among its members. The government appoints the chairperson for a period of six years. The general administrative body is elected for a period of four years. In the past the administrative body was elected as individuals but from 2009 they will be elected as party representatives.

===Norway===
Norway had 357 municipalities of varying size in 2024, each administered by an elected municipal council. They are grouped into 15 counties (fylker), each governed by an elected county council.

Each county has a governor appointed by the central government, responsible for ensuring legality in their administration. The municipal sector is a provider of vital services to the Norwegian public, accounting for about 20% of Norwegian GNP and 24% of total employment. They have the right to tax and to use their resources to support education, libraries, social security, and public works such as streetcar lines, gas and electricity works, roads, and town planning, but they are usually aided in these activities by state funds.

Oslo is the only urban center that alone constitutes a county; the remaining 14 counties consist of both urban and rural areas. County and municipal councils are popularly elected every four years.

===Portugal===
Currently, mainland Portugal is divided into 18 districts (in Portuguese, &quot;distritos&quot;). Each district takes the name of their respective capital city. Insular Portugal, comprising the two Atlantic archipelagos of the Azores and Madeira, is organized as two autonomous regions (in Portuguese, &quot;regiões autónomas&quot;).

Each district and each Autonomous region is divided into municipalities (in Portuguese, &quot;municípios&quot;) which, in turn, are subdivided into parishes (in Portuguese, &quot;freguesias&quot;).

Since 1976, when the two Autonomous regions of Portugal were established, the Azores and Madeira are no longer divided into districts.

===Poland===

Poland has three levels of subdivision. The Polish territory is divided into 16 voivodeships (provinces); these are further divided into 379 powiats (counties or districts), and these powiats are further divided into 2,479 gminas (communes or municipalities). Major cities normally have the status of both gmina and powiat.

Each voivodeship is jointly governed by the National-government appointed voivode and a locally elected sejmik (provincial assembly), which appoints an executive board led by a voivodeship marshal.

===Russia===

The Russian Federation consistes of eighty-five federal subjects that are constituent members of the Federation. However, two of these federal subjects — the Republic of Crimea and the federal city of Sevastopol—are internationally recognized as part of Ukraine. All federal subjects are of equal federal rights in the sense that they have equal representation—two delegates each—in the Federation Council (upper house of the Federal Assembly). But they do differ in the degree of autonomy they enjoy.

The modern administrative-territorial structures of the federal subjects vary significantly from one federal subject to another. While the implementation details may be considerably different, in general, however, the following types of high-level administrative divisions are recognized:
*administrative districts (raions)
*cities/towns and urban-type settlements of federal subject significance
*closed administrative-territorial formations

Typical lower-level administrative divisions include:
*selsoviets (rural councils)
*towns and urban-type settlements of the administrative district significance
*city districts

===Slovenia===
Slovenia has only one level of local self-government established: municipalities. The Constitution of the Republic of Slovenia provides also basis for establishing second level, regions, but they haven&#x27;t been established yet (Article 143).
There are two types of municipalities in Slovenia:
*urban municipalities (Art. 141 of the Constitution)
*(rural) municipalities (Art. 139 of the Constitution)
Slovenia signed (1994) and ratified (1996) European Charter of Local Self-Government without any reservations. The Charter is in force since March 1, 1997. The Congress of Local and Regional Authorities (Council of Europe) performed three monitorings (2001, 2011, and 2018).

===Spain===

Spain is divided into 17 autonomous communities, which in turn are divided into 50 provinces. There are also two autonomous cities: those of Ceuta and Melilla. Finally, each province comprises a number of municipalities.

Each administrative entity is given powers, structure, and boundaries by a law that was passed by the Prime Minister .

Law 7/1985, passed by the former Spanish Prime Minister Felipe González Márquez (socialist), lays down the procedure of the Local Government. Every city in Spain used this Law until 2003. This year, the former Spanish Prime Minister José María Aznar (conservative), passed a Law (57/2003) to modernize organic rules of those cities which had more than 250,000 inhabitants, and other important cities (like capital cities of provinces with at least 175,000 inhabitants). Also, it exists two other important Laws for specifically Madrid (Law 22/2006) and Barcelona (Law 1/2006). The main governing body in most municipalities is called Ayuntamiento (in the less populated municipalities an alternative local organization system called open council, &quot;concejo abierto&quot;, is used). The Ayuntamiento in turn is formed by the Plenary (&quot;el Pleno&quot;, the collective formed by the city councillors) and the Mayor. The number of members that compose The Plenary varies depending on city&#x27;s population (for example, since 2007 Valencia has 33 members and Pamplona has 27). The name given to the members of the Plenary is councillor (&quot;concejal&quot;). Those councillors are elected between city&#x27;s inhabitants every four years by direct vote. After being elected, councillors meet in a special Plenary session to determine who will be elected, between them, as city&#x27;s Mayor. In the next days after the election, the mayor chooses some councillors to set up the executive governing body (&quot;Junta de Gobierno&quot; or &quot;Comisión de Gobierno&quot;). After that, and for the next four years, city&#x27;s mayor and the &quot;Junta de Gobierno&quot; will govern over the city according to their competences (urbanism, some taxes, local police, licenses for specific activities, cleaning services, etc.). Meanwhile, councillors in the Plenary but not part of the &quot;Junta de Gobierno&quot; (the opposition) will oversee Mayor&#x27;s rule.
The autonomous community of Catalonia is divided in 4 provinces and more than 900 municipalities. Between these two tiers, there are 41 &quot;comarques&quot; (singular, &quot;comarca&quot;), roughly equivalent to &#x27;district&#x27; or &#x27;county&#x27;. The &quot;comarca&quot; is a commonwealth, or union, of municipalities with competences in several fields (Law 6/1987 of the Parliament of Catalonia).

===Sweden===
Every fourth year general elections are held in Sweden to elect members of the national parliament, 20 county council assemblies and 290 municipal assemblies. As the parliament elects the national government, the local assemblies elect their executive committees and their boards. Members in local committees and boards are elected proportionally by the political parties in the assemblies, giving all the major parties representation. The parties usually cooperate well on the local levels.

The county councils (&quot;landsting&quot;) are responsible for health care and usually provide transportation.

The municipalities (&quot;kommuner&quot;) are responsible for:
*social services, childcare, preschool, elderly care
*primary and secondary education
*planning and building
*health protection, water, sewerage, refuse, emergency services

On a voluntary basis, the municipalities provide sports, culture, housing, energy as well as commercial service.

The activities are financed by income taxes. Swedes pay around 20% of their taxable income to the municipality and around 11% to the county council. (The national government is financed by VAT and payroll taxes and fees.)

===Ukraine===
===United Kingdom===
The system of local government is different in each of the four home nations of the UK. In total there are 426 local authorities in the UK. 346 of these are in England, 11 in Northern Ireland, 32 in Scotland and 22 are in Wales.

====England====

The most complex system is in England, the result of numerous reforms and reorganisation over the centuries. The top-level of sub-national administration within England until the end of March 2012 consisted of the nine regions. The regions were used by central government for various statistical purposes, and Government Offices for the English Regions and assorted other institutions including Regional Development Agencies. Regional Government Offices, Regional Development Agencies and Regional Ministers were all abolished by the Cameron ministry in 2010. Only the London region which is a sub-region compared to the other regions of England has a directly elected government. Only one regional referendum has been held to date to seek consent for the introduction of direct elections elsewhere — by John Prescott in the northeast of England — and this was initially rejected by the people of the North East in 2004.

The layers of elected local government vary. In different areas the highest tier of elected local government may be:
*counties, which may be
**single-tier unitary authorities, or
**divided into districts (also known as boroughs in some areas)
*districts, which are separate unitary authorities in some areas
*metropolitan districts (also called metropolitan boroughs) in some areas which are similar to unitary authorities, but have joint boards with other districts in the same metropolitan county
*Greater London, which is divided into 32 London boroughs and the City of London

In most areas there is a lower tier of government, civil parishes, with unlimited functions and powers under the 2011 Localism Act.

Most civil parishes are in rural areas, but if the parish is a town the parish council may be called a town council. In a few cases the parish is a city, and the parish council is called a city council.

Metropolitan counties, and a few non-metropolitan counties, no longer have elected councils or administrative functions, and their former functions are performed by districts. Such counties remain ceremonial counties.

====Northern Ireland====

Since 1 April 2015 Northern Ireland is divided into 11 districts. Local government in Northern Ireland does not carry out the same range of functions as those in the rest of the United Kingdom.

====Scotland====

Local government in Scotland is arranged on the lines of unitary authorities, with the nation divided into 32 council areas.

====Wales====

Wales has a uniform system of 22 unitary authorities, variously styled as county, county borough, city or city and county local authorities. There are also communities, equivalent to parishes.

The Local Government Association (LGA) is the national membership body for local authorities in England and Wales. Its core membership is made up of 317 English councils and the 22 Welsh councils through the Welsh Local Government Association. Across the UK, the Association for Public Service Excellence (APSE) also works to assist local authorities in the UK to improve their frontline services. APSE works with more than 250 local authorities &quot;to advise and share information and expertise on a broad range of frontline public services&quot;.

==North America==

===Canada===
In Canada&#x27;s federal system, local government is the responsibility of provincial and territorial governments. The most prominent form of local government is the municipality, which is a locally elected authority with responsibility over a variety of services, such as roads, parks, fire protection, policing, planning, libraries, transit, and waste management. The exact responsibilities, powers, and governance of municipalities varies from province to province. In British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec, municipalities operate on a two-tiered system, where lower-tier local municipalities administer some services, such as fire protection or parks, while upper-tier regional municipalities administer shared services, such as utilities, waste management, or policing. The remaining provinces and territories use a single-tier system of municipal government, where each municipality is legally independent of every other, although they may still voluntarily share services.

In addition to municipal government, some provinces maintain special purpose boards to govern police services, school districts, conservation authorities, or to provide certain municipal services to unincorporated areas that would not otherwise receive them.

The federal government regulates First Nations band governments, which deliver local services to Indigenous reserves in the country. Many band governments administer more than one reserve, and may participate in tribal councils, a form of voluntary regional organization for several band governments.

===Mexico===
Mexico is a Federal Republic made up by 31 states and a federal district. Each state is divided in &quot;municipios&quot;, while the federal district is divided in sixteen . Twenty-nine states of Mexico were created as administrative divisions by the constitution of 1917, which grants them those powers not expressly vested in the federal government; Mexico&#x27;s two remaining territories, Baja California Sur and Quintana Roo, achieved statehood on 8 October 1974, raising the total to 31. Each state has a constitution, a governor elected for six years, and a unicameral legislature, with representatives elected by district vote in proportion to population. An ordinary session of the legislature is held annually, and extraordinary sessions may be called by the governor or the permanent committee. Bills may be introduced by legislators, by the governor, by the state supreme court, and by municipalities (a unit comparable to a US county). In addition to the 31 states, there is also one federal district comprising Mexico City, whose governor serves as a member of the cabinet. Many state services are supported by federal subsidies.

The principal unit of state government is the municipality. Mexico&#x27;s 2,378 municipalities are governed by municipal presidents and municipal councils. State governors generally select the nominees for the municipal elections. Municipal budgets are approved by the respective state governors. Until 1997, the president appointed the mayor of Mexico City. Political reforms allowed the first open elections in 1997, and Cuauhtémoc Cardenas Solórzano became Mexico City&#x27;s first elected mayor.

===United States===
Local government in the United States refers to governmental jurisdictions below the level of the state. Most states have at least two tiers of local government: counties and municipalities. In some states, counties are divided into townships. There are several different types of jurisdictions at the municipal level, including the city, town, parish, borough, village, reservations and boundaries. The types and nature of these municipal entities varies from state to state.

==Oceania==

===Australia===

Local government is the third tier of government in Australia, after federal and state.

===New Zealand===
New Zealand has a local government system comprising two complementary sets of local authorities—regional councils and territorial authorities. There are 78 local authorities consisting of:
*11 regional councils, which cover much of New Zealand&#x27;s land area, and
*67 territorial authorities (comprising 53 district councils, 12 city councils and 2 other councils).
Six of the territorial authorities are unitary authorities, which also have the powers of a regional council. They are Auckland Council, Nelson City Council, the Gisborne, Marlborough and Tasman district councils, and Chatham Islands Council.

Regional council areas are based on water catchment areas, whereas territorial authorities are based on community of interest and road access. Within a regional council area there are usually many city or district councils, although city and district councils can be in multiple regional council areas.

==South America==

===Argentina===
Argentina is a federation of 23 provinces and the federal capital of Buenos Aires. During the 19th century there was a bitter struggle between Buenos Aires and the interior provinces, and there has long been an element of tension regarding the division of powers between the central government and provincial bodies. The federal government retains control over such matters as the regulation of commerce, customs collections, currency, civil or commercial codes, or the appointment of foreign agents. The provincial governors are elected every four years.

The constitutional &quot;national intervention&quot; and &quot;state of siege&quot; powers of the president have been invoked frequently. The first of these powers was designed to &quot;guarantee the republican form of government in the provinces.&quot; Since the adoption of the 1853 constitution, the federal government has intervened over 200 times, mostly by presidential decree. Under this authority, provincial and municipal offices may be declared vacant, appointments annulled, and local elections supervised. Between 1966 and 1973, all local legislatures were dissolved, and provincial governors were appointed by the new president. A restoration of provincial and municipal government followed the return to constitutional government in 1973. After the March 1976 coup, the federal government again intervened to remove all provincial governors and impose direct military rule over all municipalities. Since 1983, representative local government has been in force again.

Until 1996, the President appointed the mayor of Buenos Aires, and by law, the president and Congress controlled any legislation that affected the city. Constitutional reforms that year led to an elected mayoral position, and a 60-member Poder Legislativo (legislative power).

===Brazil===

Brazil is a federation consisting of 27 federative units: 26 states and one Federal District. Government exists at three levels: federal, state, and municipal. The states are subdivided into 5,570 municipalities, while the Federal District has no municipalities (divided into administrative regions instead) and has powers of both a state and a municipality..

Municipal government consists of an executive branch headed by a mayor (&quot;Prefeito/Prefeita&quot;), and a legislative branch (&quot;Câmara Municipal),&quot; serving four-year terms&quot;.&quot; Municipalities are enshrined in the constitution of 1988 as entities of the federation; their responsibilities are distinct from the other two levels in theory, but overlap in practice (e.g. education, health, transportation). With their broad powers, municipalities may create their own constitutions, termed organic law, and cannot be overruled by state governments.

Elections at the municipal level follow a similar, partisan system to state and federal elections, but take place in different years. Municipalities may have anywhere from 9 to 55 members of the &quot;Câmara Municipal&quot;, depending on the population. There is no minimum or maximum population requirement for municipalities: while the average population of a municipality in 2005 was 30,099, Borá, São Paulo state (the least populous) had only 823 inhabitants, while São Paulo (the largest) had 10.9 million inhabitants. Municipalities within a state may choose to merge or separate with approval in a plebiscite and enacting of a state law.

===Paraguay===
Paraguay is divided into 17 departments, which are subdivided into districts, which, in turn, comprise municipalities (the minimum requirement for a municipality is 3,000 persons) and rural districts (partidos). A governor, elected by popular vote, runs each department. Municipal government is exercised through a municipal board, chosen by direct election, and an executive department. In the principal cities and capitals, the executive department is headed by a mayor appointed by the minister of the interior; in other localities, the mayor is appointed by the presidents of the municipal boards. Police chiefs are appointed by the central government.

===Peru===
Peru is divided into 25 regions and the province of Lima. Each region has an elected government composed of a president and council that serve four-year terms. These governments plan regional development, execute public investment projects, promote economic activities, and manage public property. The province of Lima is administered by a city council. The goal of devolving power to regional and municipal governments was among others to improve popular participation. NGOs played an important role in the decentralisation process and still influence local politics.

===Uruguay===
Uruguay&#x27;s administrative subdivisions consisted of nineteen territories called departments and governed by intendencias, which were subordinate to the central government and responsible for local administration. They enforced national laws and administered the nation&#x27;s social and educational policies and institutions within their territories. These territories had limited taxing powers, but they could borrow funds and acquire property. They also had the power to establish unpaid five-member local boards or town councils in municipalities other than the departmental capital if the population was large enough to warrant such a body.

Executive authority was vested in a governor (intendente), who administered the department, and in a thirty-one-member departmental board (junta departmental), which carried out legislative functions. These functions included approval of the departmental budget and judicial actions, such as impeachment proceedings against departmental officials, including the governor. At the municipal level, a mayor (intendente municipal) assumed executive and administrative duties, carrying out resolutions made by the local board (whose members were appointed on the basis of proportional representation of the political parties). The governor was required to comply with and enforce the constitution and the laws and to promulgate the decrees enacted by the departmental board. The governor was authorized to prepare the budget, submit it for approval to the departmental board, appoint the board&#x27;s employees, and, if necessary, discipline or suspend them. The governor represented the department in its relations with the national government and other departmental governments and in the negotiation of contracts with public or private agencies.

Like the governor, the members of the departmental board and the mayor were elected for five-year terms in direct, popular elections. A governor could be reelected only once, and candidates for the post had to meet the same requirements as those for a senator, in addition to being a native of the department or a resident therein for at least three years before assuming office. Departmental board members had to be at least twenty-three years of age, native born (or a legal citizen for at least three years), and a native of the department (or a resident for at least three years).

The board sat in the capital city of each department and exercised jurisdiction throughout the entire territory of the department. It could issue decrees and resolutions that it deemed necessary either on the suggestion of the governor or on its own initiative. It could approve budgets, fix the amount of taxes, request the intervention of the Accounts Tribunal for advice concerning departmental finances or administration, and remove from office—at the request of the governor—members of nonelective local departmental boards. The board also supervised local public services; public health; and primary, secondary, preparatory, industrial, and artistic education. Although Montevideo was the smallest department in terms of area (divided into twenty-three geographic zones that generally coincided with the electoral zones), its departmental board had sixty-five members in 1990; all other departments had thirty-one-member boards and a five-member executive council appointed by the departmental board, with proportional representation from the principal political parties.

Data as of December 1990

<text>Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) is a condition involving the inability to respond to androgens, typically due to androgen receptor dysfunction.

It affects 1 in 20,000 to 64,000 XY (karyotypically male) births. The condition results in the partial or complete inability of cells to respond to androgens. This unresponsiveness can impair or prevent the development of male genitals, as well as impairing or preventing the development of male secondary sexual characteristics at puberty. It does not significantly impair female genital or sexual development. The insensitivity to androgens is therefore clinically significant only when it occurs in genetic males, (i.e. individuals with a Y-chromosome, or more specifically, an SRY gene). Clinical phenotypes in these individuals range from a typical male habitus with mild spermatogenic defect or reduced secondary terminal hair, to a full female habitus, despite the presence of a Y-chromosome.

AIS is divided into three categories that are differentiated by the degree of genital masculinization:
*Mild androgen insensitivity syndrome (MAIS) is indicated when the external genitalia are those of a typical male (a penis and a scrotum)
*Partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS) is indicated when the external genitalia are partially, but not fully, masculinized
*Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) is indicated when the external genitalia are those of a typical female (a vulva)

Androgen insensitivity syndrome is the largest single entity that leads to 46,XY undermasculinized genitalia.

Management of AIS is currently limited to symptomatic management; no method is currently available to correct the malfunctioning androgen receptor proteins produced by &quot;AR&quot; gene mutations. Areas of management include sex assignment, genitoplasty, gonadectomy to reduce tumor risk, hormone replacement therapy, genetic counseling, and psychological counseling.

==Genetics==
The human androgen receptor (AR) is a protein encoded by a gene located on the proximal long arm of the X chromosome (locus Xq11-Xq12). The protein coding region consists of approximately 2,757 nucleotides (919 codons) spanning eight exons, designated 1-8 or A-H. Introns vary in size between 0.7 and 26 kb. Like other nuclear receptors, the AR protein consists of several functional domains: the transactivation domain (also called the transcription-regulation domain or the amino / NH2-terminal domain), the DNA-binding domain, the hinge region, and the steroid-binding domain (also called the carboxyl-terminal ligand-binding domain). The transactivation domain is encoded by exon 1, and makes up more than half of the AR protein. Exons 2 and 3 encode the DNA-binding domain, while the 5&#x27; portion of exon 4 encodes the hinge region. The remainder of exons 4 through 8 encodes the ligand binding domain.

===Trinucleotide satellite lengths and AR transcriptional activity===
The AR gene contains two polymorphic trinucleotide microsatellites in exon 1. The first microsatellite (nearest the 5&#x27; end) contains 8 to 60 repetitions of the glutamine codon &quot;CAG&quot; and is thus known as the polyglutamine tract. The second microsatellite contains 4 to 31 repetitions of the glycine codon &quot;GGC&quot; and is known as the polyglycine tract. The average number of repetitions varies by ethnicity, with Caucasians exhibiting an average of 21 CAG repeats, and Blacks 18. In men, disease states are associated with extremes in polyglutamine tract length; prostate cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and intellectual disability are associated with too few repetitions, while spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is associated with a CAG repetition length of 40 or more. Some studies indicate that the length of the polyglutamine tract is inversely correlated with transcriptional activity in the AR protein, and that longer polyglutamine tracts may be associated with male infertility and undermasculinized genitalia in men. However, other studies have indicated no such correlation exists. A comprehensive meta-analysis of the subject published in 2007 supports the existence of the correlation, and concluded these discrepancies could be resolved when sample size and study design are taken into account. Some studies suggest longer polyglycine tract lengths are also associated with genital masculinization defects in men. Other studies find no such association.

===AR mutations===
As of 2010, over 400 &quot;AR&quot; mutations have been reported in the &quot;AR&quot; mutation database, and the number continues to grow. Inheritance is typically maternal and follows an X-linked recessive pattern; individuals with a 46,XY karyotype always express the mutant gene since they have only one X chromosome, whereas 46,XX carriers are minimally affected. About 30% of the time, the &quot;AR&quot; mutation is a spontaneous result, and is not inherited. Such &quot;de novo&quot; mutations are the result of a germ cell mutation or germ cell mosaicism in the gonads of one of the parents, or a mutation in the fertilized egg itself. In one study, three of eight &quot;de novo&quot; mutations occurred in the postzygotic stage, leading to the estimate that up to one-third of &quot;de novo&quot; mutations result in somatic mosaicism. Not every mutation of the &quot;AR&quot; gene results in androgen insensitivity; one particular mutation occurs in 8 to 14% of genetic males, and is thought to adversely affect only a small number of individuals when other genetic factors are present.

===Other causes===
Some individuals with CAIS or PAIS do not have any &quot;AR&quot; mutations despite clinical, hormonal, and histological features sufficient to warrant an AIS diagnosis; up to 5% of women with CAIS do not have an &quot;AR&quot; mutation, as well as between 27 and 72% of individuals with PAIS.

In one patient, the underlying cause for presumptive PAIS was a mutant steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) protein. In another patient, CAIS was the result of a deficit in the transmission of a transactivating signal from the N-terminal region of the androgen receptor to the basal transcription machinery of the cell. A coactivator protein interacting with the activation function 1 (AF-1) transactivation domain of the androgen receptor may have been deficient in this patient. The signal disruption could not be corrected by supplementation with any coactivators known at the time, nor was the absent coactivator protein characterized, which left some in the field unconvinced that a mutant coactivator would explain the mechanism of androgen resistance in CAIS or PAIS patients with a typical &quot;AR&quot; gene.

===XY karyotype===
Depending on the mutation, a person with a 46,XY karyotype and AIS can have either a male (MAIS) or female (CAIS) phenotype, or may have genitalia that are only partially masculinized (PAIS). The gonads are testes regardless of phenotype due to the influence of the Y chromosome. A 46,XY female, thus, does not have ovaries, and can not contribute an egg towards conception. In some cases, 46, XY females do form a vestigial uterus and have been able to gestate children. Such examples are rare and have required the use of an egg donor, hormone therapy, and IVF.

Several case studies of fertile 46,XY males with AIS have been published, although this group is thought to be a minority. In some cases, infertile males with MAIS have been able to conceive children after increasing their sperm count through the use of supplementary testosterone.

A genetic male conceived by a man with AIS would not receive his father&#x27;s X chromosome, thus would neither inherit nor carry the gene for the syndrome. A genetic female conceived in such a way would receive her father&#x27;s X chromosome, thus would become a carrier.

===XX karyotype===
Genetic females (46,XX karyotype) have two X chromosomes, thus have two &quot;AR&quot; genes. A mutation in one (but not both) results in a minimally affected, fertile, female carrier. Some carriers have been noted to have slightly reduced body hair, delayed puberty, and/or tall stature, presumably due to skewed X-inactivation. A female carrier will pass the affected &quot;AR&quot; gene to her children 50% of the time. If the affected child is a genetic female, she, too, will be a carrier. An affected 46,XY child will have AIS.

A genetic female with mutations in both &quot;AR&quot; genes could theoretically result from the union of a fertile man with AIS and a female carrier of the gene, or from &quot;de novo&quot; mutation. However, given the scarcity of fertile AIS men and low incidence of &quot;AR&quot; mutation, the chances of this occurrence are small. The phenotype of such an individual is a matter of speculation; as of 2010, no such documented case has been published.

===Correlation of genotype and phenotype===
Individuals with partial AIS, unlike those with the complete or mild forms, present at birth with ambiguous genitalia, and the decision to raise the child as male or female is often not obvious. Unfortunately, little information regarding phenotype can be gleaned from precise knowledge of the &quot;AR&quot; mutation itself; the same &quot;AR &quot;mutation may cause significant variation in the degree of masculinization in different individuals, even among members of the same family. Exactly what causes this variation is not entirely understood, although factors contributing to it could include the lengths of the polyglutamine and polyglycine tracts, sensitivity to and variations in the intrauterine endocrine milieu, the effect of coregulatory proteins active in Sertoli cells, somatic mosaicism, expression of the &quot;5RD2&quot; gene in genital skin fibroblasts, reduced &quot;AR&quot; transcription and translation from factors other than mutations in the AR coding region, an unidentified coactivator protein, enzyme deficiencies such as 21-hydroxylase deficiency, or other genetic variations such as a mutant steroidogenic factor-1 protein. The degree of variation, however, does not appear to be constant across all &quot;AR&quot; mutations, and is much more extreme in some. Missense mutations that result in a single amino acid substitution are known to produce the most phenotypic diversity.

==Pathophysiology==
===Androgens and the androgen receptor===

The effects that androgens have on the human body (virilization, masculinization, anabolism, etc.) are not brought about by androgens themselves, but rather are the result of androgens bound to androgen receptors; the androgen receptor mediates the effects of androgens in the human body. Likewise, the androgen receptor itself is generally inactive in the cell until androgen binding occurs.

The following series of steps illustrates how androgens and the androgen receptor work together to produce androgenic effects:

In this way, androgens bound to androgen receptors regulate the expression of target genes, thus produce androgenic effects.

Theoretically, certain mutant androgen receptors can function without androgens; &quot;in vitro&quot; studies have demonstrated that a mutant androgen receptor protein can induce transcription in the absence of androgen if its steroid binding domain is deleted. Conversely, the steroid-binding domain may act to repress the AR transactivation domain, perhaps due to the AR&#x27;s unliganded conformation.

===Androgens in fetal development===
Human embryos develop similarly for the first six weeks, regardless of genetic sex (46,XX or 46,XY karyotype); the only way to tell the difference between 46,XX or 46,XY embryos during this time period is to look for Barr bodies or a Y chromosome. The gonads begin as bulges of tissue called the genital ridges at the back of the abdominal cavity, near the midline. By the fifth week, the genital ridges differentiate into an outer cortex and an inner , and are called indifferent gonads. By the sixth week, the indifferent gonads begin to differentiate according to genetic sex. If the karyotype is 46,XY, testes develop due to the influence of the Y chromosome&#x27;s &quot;SRY&quot; gene. This process does not require the presence of androgen, nor a functional androgen receptor.

Until around the seventh week of development, the embryo has indifferent sex accessory ducts, which consist of two pairs of ducts: the Müllerian ducts and the Wolffian ducts. Sertoli cells within the testes secrete anti-Müllerian hormone around this time to suppress the development of the Müllerian ducts, and cause their degeneration. Without this anti-Müllerian hormone, the Müllerian ducts develop into the female internal genitalia (uterus, cervix, fallopian tubes, and upper vaginal barrel). Unlike the Müllerian ducts, the Wolffian ducts will not continue to develop by default. In the presence of testosterone and functional androgen receptors, the Wolffian ducts develop into the epididymides, vasa deferentia, and seminal vesicles. If the testes fail to secrete testosterone, or the androgen receptors do not function properly, the Wolffian ducts degenerate.
Masculinization of the male external genitalia (the penis, penile urethra, and scrotum), as well as the prostate, are dependent on the androgen dihydrotestosterone. Testosterone is converted into dihydrotestosterone by the 5-alpha reductase enzyme. If this enzyme is absent or deficient, then dihydrotestosterone is not created, and the external male genitalia do not develop properly. As is the case with the internal male genitalia, a functional androgen receptor is needed for dihydrotestosterone to regulate the transcription of target genes involved in development.

===Pathogenesis of AIS===
Mutations in the androgen receptor gene can cause problems with any of the steps involved in androgenization, from the synthesis of the androgen receptor protein itself, through the transcriptional ability of the dimerized, androgen-AR complex. AIS can result if even one of these steps is significantly disrupted, as each step is required for androgens to activate the AR successfully and regulate gene expression. Exactly which steps a particular mutation will impair can be predicted, to some extent, by identifying the area of the AR in which the mutation resides. This predictive ability is primarily retrospective in origin; the different functional domains of the AR gene have been elucidated by analyzing the effects of specific mutations in different regions of the AR. For example, mutations in the steroid binding domain have been known to affect androgen binding affinity or retention, mutations in the hinge region have been known to affect nuclear translocation, mutations in the DNA-binding domain have been known to affect dimerization and binding to target DNA, and mutations in the transactivation domain have been known to affect target gene transcription regulation. Unfortunately, even when the affected functional domain is known, predicting the phenotypical consequences of a particular mutation (see Correlation of genotype and phenotype) is difficult.

Some mutations can adversely impact more than one functional domain. For example, a mutation in one functional domain can have deleterious effects on another by altering the way in which the domains interact. A single mutation can affect all downstream functional domains if a premature stop codon or framing error results; such a mutation can result in a completely unusable (or unsynthesizable) androgen receptor protein. The steroid binding domain is particularly vulnerable to the effects of a premature stop codon or framing error, since it occurs at the end of the gene, and its information is thus more likely to be truncated or misinterpreted than other functional domains.

Other, more complex relationships have been observed as a consequence of mutated &quot;AR&quot;; some mutations associated with male phenotypes have been linked to male breast cancer, prostate cancer, or in the case of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, disease of the central nervous system. The form of breast cancer seen in some men with PAIS is caused by a mutation in the AR&#x27;s DNA-binding domain. This mutation is thought to cause a disturbance of the AR&#x27;s target gene interaction that allows it to act at certain additional targets, possibly in conjunction with the estrogen receptor protein, to cause cancerous growth. The pathogenesis of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) demonstrates that even the mutant AR protein itself can result in pathology. The trinucleotide repeat expansion of the polyglutamine tract of the AR gene that is associated with SBMA results in the synthesis of a misfolded AR protein that the cell fails to proteolyze and disperse properly. These misfolded AR proteins form aggregates in the cell cytoplasm and nucleus. Over the course of 30 to 50 years, these aggregates accumulate and have a cytotoxic effect, eventually resulting in the neurodegenerative symptoms associated with SBMA.

==Diagnosis==
The phenotypes that result from the insensitivity to androgens are not unique to AIS, thus the diagnosis of AIS requires thorough exclusion of other causes. Clinical findings indicative of AIS include the presence of a short vagina or undermasculinized genitalia, partial or complete regression of Müllerian structures, bilateral nondysplastic testes, and impaired spermatogenesis and/or virilization. Laboratory findings include a 46,XY karyotype and typical or elevated postpubertal testosterone, luteinizing hormone, and estradiol levels. The androgen binding activity of genital skin fibroblasts is typically diminished, although exceptions have been reported. Conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone may be impaired. The diagnosis of AIS is confirmed if androgen receptor gene sequencing reveals a mutation, although not all individuals with AIS (particularly PAIS) will have an &quot;AR&quot; mutation (see Other Causes).

Each of the three types of AIS (complete, partial, and mild) has a different list of differential diagnoses to consider. However, cases have been reported of individuals with both AIS and certain diagnoses listed here, such as Klinefelter syndrome or Turner syndrome with mosaicism. Depending on the form of AIS suspected, the list of differentials can include:
===Classification===
AIS is broken down into three classes based on phenotype: complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS), partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS), and mild androgen insensitivity syndrome (MAIS). A supplemental system of phenotypic grading that uses seven classes instead of the traditional three was proposed by pediatric endocrinologist Charmian A. Quigley et al. in 1995. The first six grades of the scale, grades 1 through 6, are differentiated by the degree of genital masculinization; grade 1 is indicated when the external genitalia is fully masculinized, grade 6 is indicated when the external genitalia is fully feminized, and grades 2 through 5 quantify four degrees of decreasingly masculinized genitalia that lie in the interim. Grade 7 is indistinguishable from grade 6 until puberty, and is thereafter differentiated by the presence of secondary terminal hair; grade 6 is indicated when secondary terminal hair is present, whereas grade 7 is indicated when it is absent. The Quigley scale can be used in conjunction with the traditional three classes of AIS to provide additional information regarding the degree of genital masculinization, and is particularly useful when the diagnosis is PAIS.

====Partial AIS====
====Mild AIS====
==Management==
Management of AIS is currently limited to symptomatic management; no method is currently available to correct the malfunctioning androgen receptor proteins produced by &quot;AR&quot; gene mutations. Areas of management include sex assignment, genitoplasty, gonadectomy in relation to tumor risk, hormone replacement therapy, genetic counseling, and psychological counseling.

===MAIS===
===PAIS===
===CAIS===
==Epidemiology==
AIS represents about 15% to 20% of DSDs and affects 1 in 20,000 to 1 in 64,000 males.

Estimates for the incidence of androgen insensitivity syndrome are based on a relatively small population size, thus are known to be imprecise. CAIS is estimated to occur in one of every 20,400 46,XY births. A nationwide survey in the Netherlands based on patients with genetic confirmation of the diagnosis estimates that the minimal incidence of CAIS is one in 99,000. The incidence of PAIS is estimated to be one in 130,000. Due to its subtle presentation, MAIS is not typically investigated except in the case of male infertility, thus its true prevalence is unknown.

==Controversy==

===Preimplantation genetic diagnosis===
Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD or PIGD) refers to genetic profiling of embryos prior to implantation (as a form of embryo profiling), and sometimes even of oocytes prior to fertilization. When used to screen for a specific genetic sequence, its main advantage is that it avoids selective pregnancy termination, as the method makes it highly likely that a selected embryo will be free of the condition under consideration.

In the UK, AIS appears on a list of serious genetic diseases that may be screened for via PGD. Some ethicists, clinicians, and intersex advocates have argued that screening embryos to specifically exclude intersex traits is based on social and cultural norms as opposed to medical necessity.

==History==
Recorded descriptions of the effects of AIS date back hundreds of years, although significant understanding of its underlying histopathology did not occur until the 1950s. The taxonomy and nomenclature associated with androgen insensitivity went through a significant evolution that paralleled this understanding.

===Timeline of major milestones===
* 1950: Lawson Wilkins administers daily methyltestosterone to a karyotype 46,XY female patient, who shows no signs of virilization. His experiment is the first documented demonstration of the pathophysiology of AIS.
* 1970: Mary F. Lyon and Susan Hawkes reported that a gene on the X chromosome caused complete insensitivity to androgens in mice.
* 1981: Barbara Migeon &quot;et al.&quot; narrowed down the locus of the human androgen receptor gene (or a factor controlling the androgen receptor gene) to somewhere between Xq11 and Xq13.
* 1988: The human androgen receptor gene is first cloned and partially analyzed by multiple parties. Terry Brown &quot;et al.&quot; reported the first mutations proven to cause AIS.
* 1989: Terry Brown &quot;et al.&quot; reported the exact locus of the AR gene (Xq11-Xq12), and Dennis Lubahn &quot;et al.&quot; published its intron-exon boundaries.
* 1994: The androgen receptor gene mutations database was created to provide a comprehensive listing of mutations published in medical journals and conference proceedings.

===Early terminology===
The first descriptions of the effects of AIS appeared in the medical literature as individual case reports or as part of a comprehensive description of intersex physicalities. In 1839, Scottish obstetrician Sir James Young Simpson published one such description in an exhaustive study of intersexuality that has been credited with advancing the medical community&#x27;s understanding of the subject. Simpson&#x27;s system of taxonomy, however, was far from the first; taxonomies or descriptions for the classification of intersexuality were developed by Italian physician and physicist Fortuné Affaitati in 1549, French surgeon Ambroise Paré in 1573, French physician and sexology pioneer Nicolas Venette in 1687 (under the pseudonym Vénitien Salocini), and French zoologist Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire in 1832. All five of these authors used the colloquial term &quot;hermaphrodite&quot; as the foundation of their taxonomies, although Simpson himself questioned the propriety of the word in his publication. Use of the word &quot;hermaphrodite&quot; in the medical literature has persisted to this day, although its propriety is still in question. An alternative system of nomenclature has been recently suggested, but the subject of exactly which word or words should be used in its place still one of much debate.

===Pseudohermaphroditism===
&quot;Pseudohermaphroditism&quot; has, until very recently, been the term used in the medical literature to describe the condition of an individual whose gonads do not match the expected external genitalia in of their sex. For example, 46,XY individuals who have a female phenotype, but also have testes instead of ovaries—a group that includes all individuals with CAIS, as well as some individuals with PAIS—are classified as having &quot;male pseudohermaphroditism&quot;, while individuals with both an ovary and a testis (or at least one ovotestis) are classified as having &quot;true hermaphroditism&quot;. Use of the word in the medical literature antedates the discovery of the chromosome, thus its definition has not always taken karyotype into account when determining an individual&#x27;s sex. Previous definitions of &quot;pseudohermaphroditism&quot; relied on perceived inconsistencies between the internal and external organs; the &quot;true&quot; sex of an individual was determined by the internal organs, and the external organs determined the &quot;perceived&quot; sex of an individual.

German-Swiss pathologist Edwin Klebs is sometimes noted for using the word &quot;pseudohermaphroditism&quot; in his taxonomy of intersexuality in 1876, although the word is clearly not his invention as is sometimes reported; the history of the word &quot;pseudohermaphrodite&quot; and the corresponding desire to separate &quot;true&quot; hermaphrodites from &quot;false&quot;, &quot;spurious&quot;, or &quot;pseudo&quot; hermaphrodites, dates back to at least 1709, when Dutch anatomist Frederik Ruysch used it in a publication describing a subject with testes and a mostly female phenotype. &quot;Pseudohermaphrodite&quot; also appeared in the &quot;Acta Eruditorum&quot; later that same year, in a review of Ruysch&#x27;s work. Also some evidence indicates the word was already being used by the German and French medical community long before Klebs used it; German physiologist Johannes Peter Müller equated &quot;pseudohermaphroditism&quot; with a subclass of hermaphroditism from Saint-Hilaire&#x27;s taxonomy in a publication dated 1834, and by the 1840s &quot;pseudohermaphroditism&quot; was appearing in several French and German publications, including dictionaries.

===Testicular feminization===
In 1953, American gynecologist John Morris provided the first full description of what he called &quot;testicular feminization syndrome&quot; based on 82 cases compiled from the medical literature, including two of his own patients. The term &quot;testicular feminization&quot; was coined to reflect Morris&#x27; observation that the testicles in these patients produced a hormone that had a feminizing effect on the body, a phenomenon now understood to be due to the inaction of androgens, and subsequent aromatization of testosterone into estrogen. A few years before Morris published his landmark paper, Lawson Wilkins had shown through experiment that unresponsiveness of the target cell to the action of androgenic hormones was a cause of &quot;male pseudohermaphroditism&quot;. Wilkins&#x27; work, which clearly demonstrated the lack of a therapeutic effect when 46,XY patients were treated with androgens, caused a gradual shift in nomenclature from &quot;testicular feminization&quot; to &quot;androgen resistance&quot;.

===Other names===
A distinct name has been given to many of the various presentations of AIS, such as Reifenstein syndrome (1947), Goldberg-Maxwell syndrome (1948), Morris&#x27; syndrome (1953), Gilbert-Dreyfus syndrome (1957), Lub&#x27;s syndrome (1959), &quot;incomplete testicular feminization&quot; (1963), Rosewater syndrome (1965), and Aiman&#x27;s syndrome (1979). Since it was not understood that these different presentations were all caused by the same set of mutations in the androgen receptor gene, a unique name was given to each new combination of symptoms, resulting in a complicated stratification of seemingly disparate disorders.

Over the last 60 years, as reports of strikingly different phenotypes were reported to occur even among members of the same family, and as steady progress was made towards the understanding of the underlying molecular pathogenesis of AIS, these disorders were found to be different phenotypic expressions of one syndrome caused by molecular defects in the androgen receptor gene.

AIS is now the accepted terminology for the syndromes resulting from unresponsiveness of the target cell to the action of androgenic hormones. CAIS encompasses the phenotypes previously described by &quot;testicular feminization&quot;, Morris&#x27; syndrome, and Goldberg-Maxwell syndrome; PAIS includes Reifenstein syndrome, Gilbert-Dreyfus syndrome, Lub&#x27;s syndrome, &quot;incomplete testicular feminization&quot;, and Rosewater syndrome; and MAIS includes Aiman&#x27;s syndrome.

The more virilized phenotypes of AIS have sometimes been described as &quot;undervirilized male syndrome&quot;, &quot;infertile male syndrome&quot;, &quot;undervirilized fertile male syndrome&quot;, etc., before evidence was reported that these conditions were caused by mutations in the &quot;AR&quot; gene. These diagnoses were used to describe a variety of mild defects in virilization; as a result, the phenotypes of some men who have been diagnosed as such are better described by PAIS (e.g. micropenis, hypospadias, and undescended testes), while others are better described by MAIS (e.g. isolated male infertility or gynecomastia).

== Society and culture ==

In the film &quot;Orchids, My Intersex Adventure&quot;, Phoebe Hart and her sister Bonnie Hart, both women with CAIS, documented their exploration of AIS and other intersex issues.

Recording artist Dalea is a Hispanic-American Activist who is public about her CAIS. She has given interviews about her condition and founded Girl Comet, a non-profit diversity awareness and inspiration initiative.

In 2017, fashion model Hanne Gaby Odiele disclosed that they were born with androgen insensitivity syndrome. As a child, they underwent medical procedures relating to the condition, which they said took place without their or their parents&#x27; informed consent. They were told about their intersex condition weeks before beginning their modelling career.

In the 1991 Japanese horror novel &quot;Ring&quot; and its sequels, by Koji Suzuki (later adapted into Japanese, Korean, and American films), the central antagonist Sadako has this syndrome, as revealed by Dr Nagao when confronted by Ryuji and Asakawa. Sadako&#x27;s condition is referred to by the earlier name &quot;testicular feminisation syndrome&quot;.

In season 2, episode 13 (&quot;Skin Deep&quot;) of the TV series &quot;House&quot;, the main patient&#x27;s cancerous testicle is mistaken for an ovary due to the patient&#x27;s undiscovered CAIS. The episode has been criticized for its medical inaccuracy as well as its stigmatizing and offensive portrayal of CAIS.

In season 2 of the MTV series &quot;Faking It&quot;, a character has CAIS. The character, Lauren Cooper, played by Bailey De Young, was the first intersex series regular on American television.

In , episode 11 (&quot;Delko for the Defense&quot;) of the , the primary suspect has AIS which gets him off a rape charge.

In series 8, episode 5 of &quot;Call the Midwife&quot;, a woman discovers that she has AIS. She attends a cervical smear and brings up that she has never had a period, and is concerned about having children as she is about to be married. She is then diagnosed with &quot;testicular feminisation syndrome&quot;, the old term for AIS.

<doc id="52790" wikidata="Q7200" url="?curid=52790" title="Alexander Pushkin">
<text>Aleksandr Sergeyevich Pushkin () was a Russian poet, playwright, and novelist of the Romantic era. He is considered by many to be the greatest Russian poet, as well as the founder of modern Russian literature.

Pushkin was born into the Russian nobility in Moscow. His father, Sergey Lvovich Pushkin, belonged to an old noble family. One of his maternal great-grandfathers was Major-General Abram Petrovich Gannibal, a nobleman of African origin who was kidnapped from his homeland by the Ottomans, then freed by the Russian Emperor and raised in the Emperor&#x27;s court household as his godson.

He published his first poem at the age of 15, and was widely recognized by the literary establishment by the time of his graduation from the Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum. Upon graduation from the Lycée, Pushkin recited his controversial poem &quot;Ode to Liberty&quot;, one of several that led to his exile by Emperor Alexander I. While under strict surveillance by the Emperor&#x27;s political police and unable to publish, Pushkin wrote his most famous play, &quot;Boris Godunov&quot;. His novel in verse &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot; was serialized between 1825 and 1832. Pushkin was fatally wounded in a duel with his wife&#x27;s alleged lover and her sister&#x27;s husband, Georges-Charles de Heeckeren d&#x27;Anthès, also known as Dantes-Gekkern, a French officer serving with the Chevalier Guard Regiment.

==Ancestry==
Pushkin&#x27;s father, Sergei Lvovich Pushkin (1767–1848), was descended from a distinguished family of the Russian nobility that traced its ancestry back to the 12th century. Pushkin&#x27;s mother, Nadezhda (Nadya) Ossipovna Gannibal (1775–1836), was descended through her paternal grandmother from German and Scandinavian nobility. She was the daughter of Ossip Abramovich Gannibal (1744–1807) and his wife, Maria Alekseyevna Pushkina (1745–1818).

Ossip Abramovich Gannibal&#x27;s father, Pushkin&#x27;s great-grandfather, was Abram Petrovich Gannibal (1696–1781), an African page kidnapped and taken to Constantinople as a gift for the Ottoman Sultan and later transferred to Russia as a gift for Peter the Great. Abram wrote in a letter to Empress Elizabeth, Peter the Great&#x27;s daughter, that Gannibal was from the town of &quot;Lagon&quot;, largely on the basis of a mythical biography by Gannibal&#x27;s son-in-law Rotkirch.

Vladimir Nabokov, when researching &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot;, cast serious doubt on this origin theory. Later research by the scholars Dieudonné Gnammankou and Hugh Barnes eventually conclusively established that Gannibal was instead born in Central Africa, in an area bordering Lake Chad in modern-day Cameroon. After education in France as a military engineer, Gannibal became governor of Reval and eventually Général en Chief (the third most senior army rank) in charge of the building of sea forts and canals in Russia.
==Early life==
Born in Moscow, Pushkin was entrusted to nursemaids and French tutors, and spoke mostly French until the age of ten. He became acquainted with the Russian language through communication with household serfs and his nanny, Arina Rodionovna, whom he loved dearly and to whom he was more attached than to his own mother.

He published his first poem at the age of 15. When he finished school, as part of the first graduating class of the prestigious Imperial Lyceum in Tsarskoye Selo, near Saint Petersburg, his talent was already widely recognized on the Russian literary scene. At the Lyceum, he was a student of David Mara, known in Russia as , a younger brother of French revolutionary Jean-Paul Marat. After school, Pushkin plunged into the vibrant and raucous intellectual youth culture of St. Petersburg, which was then the capital of the Russian Empire. In 1820, he published his first long poem, &quot;Ruslan and Ludmila&quot;, with much controversy about its subject and style.

==Social activism==
While at the Lyceum, Pushkin was heavily influenced by the Kantian liberal individualist teachings of Alexander Kunitsyn, whom Pushkin would later commemorate in his poem &quot;19 October&quot;. Pushkin also immersed himself in the thought of the French Enlightenment, to which he would remain permanently indebted throughout his life, especially Voltaire, whom he described as &quot;the first to follow the new road, and to bring the lamp of philosophy into the dark archives of history&quot;.

Pushkin gradually became committed to social reform, and emerged as a spokesman for literary radicals. That angered the government and led to his transfer from the capital in May 1820. He went to the Caucasus and to Crimea and then to Kamianka and Chișinău in Bessarabia.

He joined the Filiki Eteria, a secret organization whose purpose was to overthrow Ottoman rule in Greece and establish an independent Greek state. He was inspired by the Greek Revolution and when the war against the Ottoman Empire broke out, he kept a diary recording the events of the national uprising.

==Rise==
He stayed in Chișinău until 1823 and wrote two Romantic poems which brought him acclaim: &quot;The Prisoner of the Caucasus&quot; and &quot;The Fountain of Bakhchisaray&quot;. In 1823, Pushkin moved to Odessa, where he again clashed with the government, which sent him into exile on his mother&#x27;s rural estate of Mikhailovskoye, near Pskov, from 1824 to 1826.

In Mikhaylovskoye, Pushkin wrote nostalgic love poems which he dedicated to Elizaveta Vorontsova, wife of Malorossia&#x27;s General-Governor. Then Pushkin worked on his verse-novel &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot;.

In Mikhaylovskoye, in 1825, Pushkin wrote the poem &quot;To***&quot;. It is generally believed that he dedicated this poem to Anna Kern, but there are other opinions. Poet Mikhail Dudin believed that the poem was dedicated to the serf Olga Kalashnikova. Pushkinist Kira Victorova believed that the poem was dedicated to the Empress Elizaveta Alekseyevna. Vadim Nikolayev argued that the idea about the Empress was marginal and refused to discuss it, while trying to prove that poem had been dedicated to Tatyana Larina, the heroine of &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot;.

Authorities summoned Pushkin to Moscow after his poem Ode to Liberty was found among the belongings of the rebels from the Decembrist Uprising (1825). After his exile in 1820 Pushkin&#x27;s friends and family continually petitioned for his release, sending letters and meeting Emperor Alexander I and then Emperor Nicholas I on the heels of the Decembrist Uprising. Upon meeting Emperor Nicholas I Pushkin obtained his release from exile and began to work as the emperor&#x27;s Titular Counsel of the National Archives. However, because insurgents in the Decembrist Uprising (1825) in Saint Petersburg had kept some of Pushkin&#x27;s earlier political poems, the emperor retained strict control of everything Pushkin published and he was banned from travelling at will.

During that same year (1825) Pushkin also wrote what would become his most famous play, the drama &quot;Boris Godunov&quot;, while at his mother&#x27;s estate. He could not, however, gain permission to publish it until five years later. The original and uncensored version of the drama was not staged until 2007.

Around 1825–1829 he met and befriended the Polish poet Adam Mickiewicz, during exile in central Russia. In 1829 he travelled through the Caucasus to Erzurum to visit friends fighting in the Russian army during the Russo-Turkish War. At the end of 1829 Pushkin wanted to set off on a journey abroad, the desire reflected in his poem &quot;Let&#x27;s go, I&#x27;m ready&quot;. He applied for permission for the journey but received negative response from Nicholas I on 17 January 1830.
Around 1828 Pushkin met Natalia Goncharova, then 16 years old and one of the most talked-about beauties of Moscow. After much hesitation Natalia accepted a proposal of marriage from Pushkin in April 1830, but not before she received assurances that the Tsarist government had no intention of persecuting the libertarian poet. Later Pushkin and his wife became regulars of court society. They officially became engaged on 6 May 1830 and sent out wedding invitations. Owing to an outbreak of cholera and other circumstances, the wedding was delayed for a year. The ceremony took place on 18 February 1831 (Old Style) in the Great Ascension Church on Bolshaya Nikitskaya Street in Moscow.

Pushkin&#x27;s marriage to Goncharova was largely a happy one, but his wife’s characteristic flirtatiousness and frivolity would lead to his fatal duel seven years later, for Pushkin had a highly jealous temperament.
In 1831, during the period of Pushkin&#x27;s growing literary influence, he met one of Russia&#x27;s other influential early writers, Nikolai Gogol. After reading Gogol&#x27;s 1831–1832 volume of short stories &quot;Evenings on a Farm Near Dikanka&quot;, Pushkin supported him and would feature some of Gogol&#x27;s most famous short stories in the magazine &quot;The Contemporary&quot;, which he founded in 1836.

==Death==
By the autumn of 1836, Pushkin was falling into greater and greater debt and faced scandalous rumours that his wife was having a love affair. On 4 November, he sent a challenge to a duel to Georges d&#x27;Anthès, also known as Dantes-Gekkern. Jacob van Heeckeren, d&#x27;Anthès&#x27; adoptive father, asked that the duel be delayed by two weeks. With efforts by the poet&#x27;s friends, the duel was cancelled.

On 17 November, d&#x27;Anthès proposed to Natalia Goncharova&#x27;s sister, Ekaterina. The marriage did not resolve the conflict. D&#x27;Anthès continued to pursue Natalia Goncharova in public and rumours circulated that d&#x27;Anthès had married Natalia&#x27;s sister just to save her reputation.

On 26 January (7 February in the Gregorian calendar) 1837 Pushkin sent a &quot;highly insulting letter&quot; to Gekkern. The only answer to that letter could be a challenge to a duel, as Pushkin knew. Pushkin received the formal challenge to a duel through his sister-in-law, Ekaterina Gekkerna, approved by d&#x27;Anthès, on the same day through the attaché of the French Embassy, Viscount d&#x27;Archiac.

Pushkin asked Arthur Magenis, then attaché to the British Consulate-General in Saint Petersburg, to be his second. Magenis did not formally accept but on 26 January (7 February) approached Viscount d&#x27;Archiac to attempt a reconciliation; however d&#x27;Archiac refused to speak with him as he was not yet officially Pushkin&#x27;s second. Magenis, unable to find Pushkin in the evening, sent him a letter through a messenger at 2 o&#x27;clock in the morning declining to be his second, as the possibility of a peaceful settlement had already been quashed, and the traditional first task of the second was to try to bring about a reconciliation.

The pistol duel with d&#x27;Anthès took place on 27 January (8 February) at the Black River, without the presence of a second for Pushkin. The duel they fought was of a kind known as a &quot;barrier duel&quot;. The rules of this type dictated that the duellists began at an agreed distance. After the signal to begin, they walked towards each other, closing the distance. They could fire at any time they wished, but the duellist that shot first was required to stand still and wait for the other to shoot back at his leisure.

D&#x27;Anthès fired first, critically wounding Pushkin; the bullet entered at his hip and penetrated his abdomen. D&#x27;Anthès was only lightly wounded in the right arm by Pushkin&#x27;s shot. Two days later, at 2.45 pm on 29 January (10 February), Pushkin died of peritonitis.

In Fyodor Dostoevsky&#x27;s novel The Idiot, a character suggests that the shot was accidental: ‘The bullet hit so low that d’Anthès was probably aiming somewhere higher, the chest or the head; nobody aims where that bullet hit, that means it probably hit Pushkin by chance, a fluke. I’ve been told that by people who know.’ 

At Pushkin&#x27;s wife&#x27;s request he was put in the coffin in evening dress, not in chamber-cadet uniform, the uniform provided by the emperor. The funeral service was initially assigned to St Isaac&#x27;s Cathedral but was moved to Konyushennaya church. Many people attended. After the funeral the coffin was lowered into the basement, where it stayed until 3 February, when it was removed to Pskov province. Pushkin was buried in the grounds of Svyatogorsky monastery in present-day Pushkinskiye Gory, near Pskov, beside his mother. His last home is now a museum.

==Descendants==
Pushkin had four children from his marriage to Natalia: Maria (b. 1832), Alexander (b. 1833), Grigory (b. 1835) and Natalia (b. 1836), the last of whom married morganatically Prince Nikolaus Wilhelm of Nassau of the House of Nassau-Weilburg and was granted the title of Countess of Merenberg. Her daughter Sophie married Grand Duke Michael Mikhailovich of Russia, a grandson of Emperor Nicholas I.
Only the lines of Alexander and Natalia still remain. Natalia&#x27;s granddaughter, Nadejda, married into the extended British royal family, her husband being the uncle of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, and is the grandmother of the present Marquess of Milford Haven. Descendants of the poet now live around the globe in the United Kingdom, the Czech Republic, Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg and the United States.

==Legacy==

===Literary===
Critics consider many of his works masterpieces, such as the poem &quot;The Bronze Horseman&quot; and the drama &quot;The Stone Guest&quot;, a tale of the fall of Don Juan. His poetic short drama &quot;Mozart and Salieri&quot; (like &quot;The Stone Guest&quot;, one of the so-called four &quot;Little Tragedies&quot;, a collective characterization by Pushkin himself in 1830 letter to Pyotr Pletnyov) was the inspiration for Peter Shaffer&#x27;s &quot;Amadeus&quot; as well as providing the libretto (almost verbatim) to Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s opera &quot;Mozart and Salieri&quot;.

Pushkin is also known for his short stories. In particular his cycle &quot;The Tales of the Late Ivan Petrovich Belkin&quot;, including The Shot, were well received. According to the literary theorist Kornelije Kvas, &quot;the narrative logic and the plausibility of that which is narrated, together with the precision, conciseness – economy of the presentation of reality – all of the above is achieved in &quot;Tales of Belkin&quot;, especially, and most of all in the story &quot;The Stationmaster&quot;. Pushkin is the progenitor of the long and fruitful development of Russian realist literature, for he manages to attain the realist ideal of a concise presentation of reality&quot;. Pushkin himself preferred his verse novel &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot;, which he wrote over the course of his life and which, starting a tradition of great Russian novels, follows a few central characters but varies widely in tone and focus.

&quot;Onegin&quot; is a work of such complexity that, though it is only about a hundred pages long, translator Vladimir Nabokov needed two full volumes of material to fully render its meaning into English. Because of this difficulty in translation, Pushkin&#x27;s verse remains largely unknown to English readers. Even so Pushkin has profoundly influenced western writers such as Henry James.
Pushkin wrote The Queen of Spades, a short story frequently anthologized in English translation.

===Musical===
Pushkin&#x27;s works also provided fertile ground for Russian composers. Glinka&#x27;s &quot;Ruslan and Lyudmila&quot; is the earliest important Pushkin-inspired opera, and a landmark in the tradition of Russian music. Tchaikovsky&#x27;s operas &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot; (1879) and &quot;The Queen of Spades&quot; (&quot;Pikovaya Dama&quot;, 1890) became perhaps better known outside of Russia than Pushkin&#x27;s own works of the same name.

Mussorgsky&#x27;s monumental &quot;Boris Godunov&quot; (two versions, 1868–9 and 1871–2) ranks as one of the very finest and most original of Russian operas.
Other Russian operas based on Pushkin include Dargomyzhsky&#x27;s &quot;Rusalka&quot; and &quot;The Stone Guest&quot;; Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s &quot;Mozart and Salieri&quot;, &quot;Tale of Tsar Saltan&quot;, and &quot;The Golden Cockerel&quot;; Cui&#x27;s &quot;Prisoner of the Caucasus&quot;, &quot;Feast in Time of Plague&quot;, and &quot;The Captain&#x27;s Daughter&quot;; Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Mazeppa&quot;; Rachmaninoff&#x27;s one-act operas &quot;Aleko&quot; (based on &quot;The Gypsies&quot;) and &quot;The Miserly Knight&quot;; Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Mavra&quot;, and Nápravník&#x27;s &quot;Dubrovsky&quot;.

Additionally, ballets and cantatas, as well as innumerable songs, have been set to Pushkin&#x27;s verse (including even his French-language poems, in Isabelle Aboulker&#x27;s song cycle &quot;Caprice étrange&quot;). Suppé, Leoncavallo and Malipiero have also based operas on his works. Composers Yudif Grigorevna Rozhavskaya, Galina Konstantinovna Smirnova, Yevgania Yosifovna Yakhina, Maria Semyonovna Zavalishina, Zinaida Petrovna Ziberova composed folk songs using Pushkin&#x27;s text.

&quot;The Desire of Glory&quot;, which has been dedicated to Elizaveta Vorontsova, was set to music by David Tukhmanov, as well as &quot;Keep Me, Mine Talisman&quot; – by Alexander Barykin and later by Tukhmanov.

===Romanticism===
Pushkin is considered by many to be the central representative of Romanticism in Russian literature; however, he was not unequivocally known as a Romantic. Russian critics have traditionally argued that his works represent a path from Neoclassicism through Romanticism to Realism. An alternative assessment suggests that &quot;he had an ability to entertain contrarities which may seem Romantic in origin, but are ultimately subversive of all fixed points of view, all single outlooks, including the Romantic&quot; and that &quot;he is simultaneously Romantic and not Romantic&quot;.

===Russian literature===
Pushkin is usually credited with developing Russian literature. He is seen as having originated the highly nuanced level of language which characterizes Russian literature after him, and he is also credited with substantially augmenting the Russian lexicon. Whenever he found gaps in the Russian vocabulary, he devised calques. His rich vocabulary and highly-sensitive style are the foundation for modern Russian literature. His accomplishments set new records for development of the Russian language and culture. He became the father of Russian literature in the 19th century, marking the highest achievements of the 18th century and the beginning of literary process of the 19th century. He introduced Russia to all the European literary genres as well as a great number of West European writers. He brought natural speech and foreign influences to create modern poetic Russian. Though his life was brief, he left examples of nearly every literary genre of his day: lyric poetry, narrative poetry, the novel, the short story, the drama, the critical essay and even the personal letter.

According to Vladimir Nabokov, Pushkin&#x27;s idiom combined all the contemporaneous elements of Russian with all he had learned from Derzhavin, Zhukovsky, Batyushkov, Karamzin and Krylov:

# The poetical and metaphysical strain that still lived in Church Slavonic forms and locutions
# Abundant and natural gallicisms
# Everyday colloquialisms of his set
# Stylized popular speech by combining the famous three styles (low, medium elevation, high) dear to the pseudoclassical archaists and adding the ingredients of Russian romanticists with a pinch of parody.

His work as a critic and as a journalist marked the birth of Russian magazine culture which included him devising and contributing heavily to one of the most influential literary magazines of the 19th century, the &quot;Sovremennik&quot; (&quot;The Contemporary&quot;, or &quot;Современник&quot;). Pushkin inspired the folk tales and genre pieces of other authors: Leskov, Yesenin and Gorky. His use of Russian formed the basis of the style of novelists Ivan Turgenev, Ivan Goncharov and Leo Tolstoy, as well as that of subsequent lyric poets such as Mikhail Lermontov. Pushkin was analysed by Nikolai Gogol, his successor and pupil, and the great Russian critic Vissarion Belinsky, who produced the fullest and deepest critical study of Pushkin&#x27;s work, which still retains much of its relevance.

===Soviet centennial celebrations===
In the centennial year of Pushkin&#x27;s death in 1937, a mass renaming of streets across the entire Soviet Union occurred in his honour. Prior to 2022, Pushkin was the third most common historical figure represented in Ukraine’s streets; however, his monuments were removed and streets bearing his name were renamed following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. These monuments, along with any toponymy named after him, are now illegal in Ukraine following the implementation of a law that bans symbols &quot;dedicated to persons who publicly, including … in literary and other artistic works, supported, glorified, or justified Russian imperial policy&quot;.

The centennial of Pushkin&#x27;s death in 1937 was one of the most significant literary commemorations of the Soviet era, second only to the 1928 centennial of Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s birth. Although Pushkin&#x27;s image was prominently displayed in Soviet propaganda, from billboards to candy wrappers, it conflicted with the ideal Soviet persona. Pushkin was reputed as a libertine with aristocratic tendencies, which clashed with Soviet values and led to a form of repressive revisionism, akin to the Stalinist reworking of Tolstoy&#x27;s Christian anarchism.

==Honours==
*Shortly after Pushkin&#x27;s death, contemporary Russian romantic poet Mikhail Lermontov wrote &quot;Death of the Poet&quot;. The poem, which ended with a passage blaming the aristocracy being (as oppressors of freedom) the true culprits in Pushkin&#x27;s death, was not published (nor could have been) but was informally circulated in St. Petersburg. Lermontov was arrested and exiled to a regiment in the Caucasus.

<text>The Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts (, abbreviated as ) is the largest museum of European art in Moscow. It is located in Volkhonka street, just opposite the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour. The International musical festival &quot;Sviatoslav Richter&#x27;s December nights&quot; has been held in the Pushkin Museum since 1981.

==Etymology==
Despite its name, the museum has no direct association with the Russian poet Alexander Pushkin, other than as a posthumous commemoration. The facility was founded by professor Ivan Tsvetaev (father of the poet Marina Tsvetaeva) in 1912. Tsvetaev persuaded the millionaire and philanthropist Yuriy Nechaev-Maltsov and the architect Roman Klein of the urgent need to give Moscow a fine arts museum. After going through a number of name changes, particularly in the transition to the Soviet era and the return of the Russian capital to Moscow, the museum was finally renamed to honour Pushkin in 1937, the 100th anniversary of his death.

== History ==
During the Bolshevik Revolution, works by French impressionists and modern artists were confiscated and then exhibited in the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg before being privately stored. In 2019, those works reappeared and some of them rejoined the Pushkin museum. In 1981, the museum held the &quot;Moscow-Paris&quot; exhibition. In 2016, art historians discovered 59 Italian Renaissance sculptures in the Pushkin Museum that had been missing from Berlin&#x27;s collections since the Second World War.

In March 2022, a number of museums officials, including deputy directors, resigned to protest against Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine.

==Building==
The building of the Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts was designed by Roman Klein and Vladimir Shukhov. Construction lasted from 1898 until early 1912, with Ivan Rerberg heading structural engineering effort on the museum site for the first 12 years.

In 2008, President Dmitri A. Medvedev announced plans for a $177 million restoration. A 22 billion rubles ($670 million) expansion, developed by Norman Foster in collaboration with local architectural firm Mosproject-5, was confirmed in 2009, but became mired in disputes with officials and preservationists and concern grew that it would not be completed on schedule for 2018. After Moscow&#x27;s chief architect Sergei Kuznetsov issued an ultimatum, demanding that Foster take a more active role in the project and prove his commitment by coming to the Russian capital within a month, Norman Foster&#x27;s firm resigned from the project in 2013. In 2014, Russian architect Yuri Grigoryan, and his firm Project Meganom, were chosen to take over the project. Grigoryan&#x27;s design provides new modern buildings and, following the protest of heritage groups who campaigned to save the pre-revolutionary architecture, preserves the historic 1930s gas station near the Pushkin&#x27;s main building inside a glass structure.

==Collection==
The holdings of the Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts currently include around 700,000 paintings, sculptures, drawings, applied works, photographs, and archaeological and animalistic objects.

===Painting===
 The earliest monuments from the museum collection are pieces of Byzantine art: mosaics and icons. The early stage of development of Western European painting is represented by a relatively small collection of Italian Primitives. The hall of early Italian art was opened on October 10, 1924.

===Graphic art===

The Department of Prints and Drawings was founded in 1924, when the museum received the holdings of the Printing Cabinet of the Moscow Public and Rumyantsev Museum. In 1861, Alexander II made a valuable gift to the Printing Cabinet: the Moscow Public and Rumyantsev Museum received more than 20,000 prints from the Hermitage. 

===Sculpture===

The collection of Western European sculptures includes more than 600 pieces. The museum has expanded its holdings over the years and currently owns artworks from the 6th-21st centuries. The first artifacts presented to the Museum of Fine Arts were sculptures from Mikhail Schekin&#x27;s collections. After the revolution, the museum received sculptures from nationalized collections. 

===Collection of decorative art pieces (Department of the Old Masters)===
The collection of decorative art pieces from Europe includes around 2,000 items. The earliest are from the Middle Ages, and the set as a whole is very diverse. 

===Archaeological collection===
The Museum of Fine Arts was intended primarily as a museum of classical arts. Ancient artifacts were the core and the main components of its collection, and the Department of Antiquity was one of the three major scientific departments. Its founder and director, Ivan Tsvetaev (1847-1913), was an expert in ancient art, as were his closest associates, Vladimir Malmberg (1860-1921) and Nikolay Scherbakov (1884-1933).

====Egypt====
Most of the objects presented in Hall No. 1 have been on display since the museum opening in 1912 and come from the collection of Vladimir Golenishchev (1856-1947).

====Ancient civilizations====
The museum holdings of genuine artifacts of Southwest Asia are based on the collection of Russian Orientalist and Egyptologist Vladimir Golenishchev.

====Antiquity====
The antique collection of the Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts includes many genuine artifacts: more than 1,000 vessels, small plastic pieces, and sculptures.

====Tsvetaev&#x27;s collection of casts====
The collection of casts and copies, typical for European museums of the nineteenth century, is unique today in its preservation and consistency. With a similar cohesiveness, Tsvetaev wanted to present plastic art of the modern era and complete the collection with casts made from contemporary sculptures, where Auguste Rodin&#x27;s works would take the central place.

===Numismatic collection===
Today, the holdings of the Numismatics Department of the Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts form a collection in excess of 200,000 items and 3,000 volumes of the special library. It was started at Imperial Moscow University. In 1888, the collection was divided and formed the basis for the major numismatic collections of Moscow that belonged to the Historical Museum and the Alexander III Fine Arts Museum.

Since 1912, objects of ancient and Western European numismatics from the university collection were transferred to the Sculpture Department of the Fine Arts Museum and mostly kept packaged. By June 1925, museum custodians had grouped together a number of cases with coins, medals, and casts and created the Numismatic Cabinet located on the balcony of the White Hall. In 1945, the museum&#x27;s Numismatic Cabinet became an independent department. It includes archaeological material from Central Asia, such as a hoard of Kushano-Sasanian coins acquired in 2002.

==Museum Quarter==

The work on the Museum Quarter of the Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts started in the late 2000s. In 2019–23, the Main Building of the Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts will be reconstructed.

<text>A digital camera, also called a digicam, is a camera that captures photographs in digital memory. Most cameras produced today are digital, largely replacing those that capture images on photographic film or film stock. Digital cameras are now widely incorporated into mobile devices like smartphones with the same or more capabilities and features of dedicated cameras. High-end, high-definition dedicated cameras are still commonly used by professionals and those who desire to take higher-quality photographs.

Digital and digital movie cameras share an optical system, typically using a lens with a variable diaphragm to focus light onto an image pickup device. The diaphragm and shutter admit a controlled amount of light to the image, just as with film, but the image pickup device is electronic rather than chemical. However, unlike film cameras, digital cameras can display images on a screen immediately after being recorded, and store and delete images from memory. Many digital cameras can also record moving videos with sound. Some digital cameras can crop and stitch pictures and perform other kinds of image editing.

== History ==
The first semiconductor image sensor was the charge-coupled device (CCD), invented by Willard S. Boyle and George E. Smith at Bell Labs in 1969, based on MOS capacitor technology. The NMOS active-pixel sensor was later invented by Tsutomu Nakamura&#x27;s team at Olympus in 1985, which led to the development of the CMOS active-pixel sensor (CMOS sensor) at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 1993.

In the 1960s, Eugene F. Lally of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory was thinking about how to use a mosaic photosensor to capture digital images. His idea was to take pictures of the planets and stars while travelling through space to give information about the astronauts&#x27; position. As with Texas Instruments employee Willis Adcock&#x27;s filmless camera (US patent 4,057,830) in 1972, the technology had yet to catch up with the concept.

In 1972, the Landsat 1 satellite&#x27;s multispectral scanner (MSS) started taking digital images of Earth. The MSS, designed by Virginia Norwood at Hughes Aircraft Company starting in 1969, captured and transmitted image data from green, red, and two infrared bands with 6 bits per channel, using a mechanical rocking mirror and an array of 24 detectors. Operating for six years, it transmitted more than 300,000 digital photographs of Earth while orbiting the planet about 14 times per day.

Also in 1972, Thomas McCord from MIT and James Westphal from Caltech together developed a digital camera for use with telescopes. Their 1972 &quot;photometer-digitizer system&quot; used an analog-to-digital converter and a digital frame memory to store 256 x 256-pixel images of planets and stars, which were then recorded on digital magnetic tape.  CCD sensors were not yet commercially available, and the camera used a silicon diode vidicon tube detector, which was cooled using dry ice to reduce dark current, allowing exposure times of up to one hour.   

The Cromemco Cyclops was an all-digital camera introduced as a commercial product in 1975. Its design was published as a hobbyist construction project in the February 1975 issue of &quot;Popular Electronics&quot; magazine. It used a 32×32 metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) image sensor, which was a modified MOS dynamic RAM (DRAM) memory chip.

Steven Sasson, an engineer at Eastman Kodak, built a self-contained electronic camera that used a monochrome Fairchild CCD image sensor in 1975. Around the same time, Fujifilm began developing CCD technology in the 1970s. Early uses were mainly military and scientific, followed by medical and news applications.

The first filmless SLR (single lens reflex) camera was publicly demonstrated by Sony in August 1981. The Sony &quot;Mavica&quot; (magnetic still video camera) used a color-striped 2/3&quot; format CCD sensor with 280K pixels, along with analogue video signal processing and recording. The Mavica electronic still camera recorded FM-modulated analog video signals on a newly developed 2&quot; magnetic floppy disk, dubbed the &quot;Mavipak&quot;. The disk format was later standardized as the &quot;Still Video Floppy&quot;, or &quot;SVF&quot;.

The Canon RC-701, introduced in May 1986, was the first SVF camera (and the first electronic SLR camera) sold in the US. It employed an SLR viewfinder, included a 2/3&quot; format color CCD sensor with 380K pixels, and was sold along with a removable 11-66mm and 50-150mm zoom lens.  

Over the next few years, many other companies began selling SVF cameras. These analog electronic cameras included the Nikon QV-1000C, which had an SLR viewfinder and a 2/3&quot; format monochrome CCD sensor with 380K pixels and recorded analog black-and-white images on a Still Video Floppy.

At Photokina 1988, Fujifilm introduced the FUJIX DS-1P, the first fully digital camera, which recorded digital images using a semiconductor memory card. The camera&#x27;s memory card had a capacity of 2 MB of SRAM (static random-access memory) and could hold up to ten photographs. In 1989, Fujifilm released the FUJIX DS-X, the first fully digital camera to be commercially released. In 1996, Toshiba&#x27;s 40 MB flash memory card was adopted for several digital cameras.

The first commercial camera phone was the Kyocera Visual Phone VP-210, released in Japan in May 1999. It was called a &quot;mobile videophone&quot; at the time, and had a 110,000-pixel front-facing camera. It stored up to 20 JPEG digital images, which could be sent over e-mail, or the phone could send up to two images per second over Japan&#x27;s Personal Handy-phone System (PHS) cellular network. The Samsung SCH-V200, released in South Korea in June 2000, was also one of the first phones with a built-in camera. It had a TFT liquid-crystal display (LCD) and stored up to 20 digital photos at 350,000-pixel resolution. However, it could not send the resulting image over the telephone function but required a computer connection to access photos. The first mass-market camera phone was the J-SH04, a Sharp J-Phone model sold in Japan in November 2000. It could instantly transmit pictures via cell phone telecommunication. By the mid-2000s, higher-end cell phones had an integrated digital camera, and by the early 2010s, almost all smartphones had an integrated digital camera.

== Image sensors ==

The two major types of digital image sensors are CCD and CMOS. A CCD sensor has one amplifier for all the pixels, while each pixel in a CMOS active-pixel sensor has its own amplifier. Compared to CCDs, CMOS sensors use less power. Cameras with a small sensor use a back-side-illuminated CMOS (BSI-CMOS) sensor. The image processing capabilities of the camera determine the outcome of the final image quality much more than the sensor type.

=== Sensor resolution ===

The resolution of a digital camera is often limited by the image sensor that turns light into discrete signals. The brighter the image at a given point on the sensor, the larger the value that is read for that pixel.
Depending on the physical structure of the sensor, a color filter array may be used, which requires demosaicing to recreate a full-color image. The number of pixels in the sensor determines the camera&#x27;s &quot;pixel count&quot;.
In a typical sensor, the pixel count is the product of the number of rows and the number of columns. For example, a 1,000 by 1,000-pixel sensor would have 1,000,000 pixels, or 1 megapixel.

==== Resolution options ====
Firmwares&#x27; resolution selector allows the user to optionally lower the resolution to reduce the file size per picture and extend lossless digital zooming. The bottom resolution option is typically 640×480 pixels (0.3 megapixels).

A lower resolution extends the number of remaining photos in free space, postponing the exhaustion of space storage, which is of use where no further data storage device is available and for captures of lower significance, where the benefit from less space storage consumption outweighs the disadvantage from reduced detail.

=== Image sharpness ===
An image&#x27;s sharpness is presented through the crisp detail, defined lines, and its depicted contrast. Sharpness is a factor of multiple systems throughout the DSLR camera by its ISO, resolution, lens, and the lens settings, the environment of the image, and its post-processing. Images have a possibility of being too sharp, but they can never be too in focus.

A digital camera resolution is determined by a digital sensor. The digital sensor indicates a high level of sharpness can be produced through the amount of noise and grain that is tolerated through the lens of the camera. Resolution within the field of digital stills and digital movies is indicated through the camera&#x27;s ability to determine detail based on the distance, which is then measured by frame size, pixel type, number, and organization. Although some DSLR cameras have limited resolutions, it is almost impossible to not have the proper sharpness for an image. The ISO choice when taking a photo affects the quality of the image, as high ISO settings equate to an image that is less sharp due to the increased amount of noise allowed into the image, along with too little noise, which can also produce an image that is not sharp.

=== Methods of image capture ===

Since the first digital backs were introduced, there have been three main methods of capturing the image, each based on the hardware configuration of the sensor and color filters.

&quot;Single-shot&quot; capture systems use either one sensor chip with a Bayer filter mosaic, or three separate image sensors (one each for the primary additive colors red, green, and blue) which are exposed to the same image via a beam splitter (see Three-CCD camera).

&quot;Multi-shot&quot; exposes the sensor to the image in a sequence of three or more openings of the lens aperture. There are several methods of application of the multi-shot technique. The most common was originally to use a single image sensor with three filters passed in front of the sensor in sequence to obtain the additive color information. Another multiple-shot method is called microscanning. This method uses a single sensor chip with a Bayer filter and physically moves the sensor on the focus plane of the lens to construct a higher resolution image than the native resolution of the chip. A third version combines these two methods without a Bayer filter on the chip.

The third method is called &quot;scanning&quot; because the sensor moves across the focal plane much like the sensor of an image scanner. The &quot;linear&quot; or &quot;tri-linear&quot; sensors in scanning cameras utilize only a single line of photosensors, or three lines for the three colors. Scanning may be accomplished by moving the sensor (for example, when using color co-site sampling) or by rotating the whole camera. A digital rotating line camera offers images consisting of a total resolution that is very high.

The choice of method for a given capture is determined largely by the subject matter. It is usually inappropriate to attempt to capture a subject that moves with anything but a single-shot system. However, the higher color fidelity and larger file sizes and resolutions that are available with multi-shot and scanning backs make them more attractive for commercial photographers who are working with stationary subjects and large-format photographs.

Improvements in single-shot cameras and image file processing at the beginning of the 21st century made single-shot cameras almost completely dominant, even in high-end commercial photography.

=== Filter mosaics, interpolation, and aliasing ===

Most current consumer digital cameras use a Bayer filter mosaic in combination with an optical anti-aliasing filter to reduce the aliasing due to the reduced sampling of the different primary-color images.
A demosaicing algorithm is used to interpolate color information to create a full array of RGB image data.

Cameras that use a beam-splitter single-shot 3CCD approach, three-filter multi-shot approach, color co-site sampling or Foveon X3 sensor do not use anti-aliasing filters, nor demosaicing.
Firmware in the camera, or a software in a raw converter program such as Adobe Camera Raw, interprets the raw data from the sensor to obtain a full-color image, because the RGB color model requires three intensity values for each pixel: one each for the red, green, and blue (other color models, when used, also require three or more values per pixel).
A single sensor element cannot simultaneously record these three intensities, so a color filter array (CFA) must be used to selectively filter a particular color for each pixel.

The Bayer filter pattern is a repeating 2x2 mosaic pattern of light filters, with green ones at opposite corners and red and blue in the other two positions. The high proportion of green takes advantage of the properties of the human visual system, which determines brightness mostly from green and is far more sensitive to brightness than to hue or saturation. Sometimes a 4-color filter pattern is used, often involving two different hues of green. This provides potentially more accurate color, but requires a slightly more complicated interpolation process.

The color intensity values not captured for each pixel can be interpolated from the values of adjacent pixels which represent the color being calculated.

=== Sensor size and angle of view ===

Cameras with digital image sensors that are smaller than the typical 35 mm film size have a smaller field or angle of view when used with a lens of the same focal length. This is because the angle of view is a function of both focal length and the sensor or film size used.

The crop factor is relative to the 35mm film format. If a smaller sensor is used, as in most digicams, the field of view is cropped by the sensor to smaller than the 35 mm full-frame format&#x27;s field of view. This narrowing of the field of view may be described as crop factor, a factor by which a longer focal length lens would be needed to get the same field of view on a 35 mm film camera. Full-frame digital SLRs utilize a sensor of the same size as a frame of 35 mm film.

Common values for field of view crop in DSLRs using active pixel sensors include 1.3x for some Canon (APS-H) sensors, 1.5x for Sony APS-C sensors used by Nikon, Pentax and Konica Minolta and for Fujifilm sensors, 1.6 (APS-C) for most Canon sensors, ~1.7x for Sigma&#x27;s Foveon sensors and 2x for Kodak and Panasonic 4/3-inch sensors currently used by Olympus and Panasonic. Crop factors for non-SLR consumer compact and bridge cameras are larger, frequently 4x or more.



=== Sensor resolution ===
The resolution of a digital camera is often limited by the image sensor that turns light into discrete signals. The brighter the image at a given point on the sensor, the larger the value that is read for that pixel. Depending on the physical structure of the sensor, a color filter array may be used, which requires demosaicing to recreate a full-color image. The number of pixels in the sensor determines the camera&#x27;s &quot;pixel count&quot;. In a typical sensor, the pixel count is the product of the number of rows and the number of columns. Pixels are square and is often equal to 1, for example, a 1,000 by 1,000-pixel sensor would have 1,000,000 pixels, or 1 megapixel. On full-frame sensors (i.e., 24 mm 36 mm), some cameras propose images with 20–25 million pixels that were captured by 7.5–m photosites, or a surface that is 50 times larger.  

== Types of digital cameras ==
Digital cameras come in a wide range of sizes, prices, and capabilities. In addition to general-purpose digital cameras, specialized cameras including multispectral imaging equipment and astrographs are used for scientific, military, medical, and other special purposes.

=== Compacts ===
Compact cameras are intended to be portable (pocketable) and are particularly suitable for casual &quot;snapshots&quot;. Point-and-shoot cameras usually fall under this category.

Many incorporate a retractable lens assembly that provides optical zoom. In most models, an auto-actuating lens cover protects the lens from elements. Most ruggedized or water-resistant models do not retract, and most with superzoom capability do not retract fully.

Compact cameras are usually designed to be easy to use. Almost all include an automatic mode, or &quot;auto mode&quot;, which automatically makes all camera settings for the user. Some also have manual controls. Compact digital cameras typically contain a small sensor that trades-off picture quality for compactness and simplicity; images can usually only be stored using lossy compression (JPEG). Most have a built-in flash usually of low power, sufficient for nearby subjects. A few high-end compact digital cameras have a hotshoe for connecting to an external flash. Live preview is almost always used to frame the photo on an integrated LCD. In addition to being able to take still photographs almost all compact cameras have the ability to record video.

Compacts often have macro capability and zoom lenses, but the zoom range (up to 30x) is generally enough for candid photography but less than is available on bridge cameras (more than 60x), or the interchangeable lenses of DSLR cameras available at a much higher cost. Autofocus systems in compact digital cameras generally are based on a contrast-detection methodology using the image data from the live preview feed of the main imager. Some compact digital cameras use a hybrid autofocus system similar to what is commonly available on DSLRs.

Typically, compact digital cameras incorporate a nearly silent leaf shutter into the lens but play a simulated camera sound for skeuomorphic purposes.

For low cost and small size, these cameras typically use image sensor formats with a diagonal between 6 and 11 mm, corresponding to a crop factor between 7 and 4. This gives them weaker low-light performance, greater depth of field, generally closer focusing ability, and smaller components than cameras using larger sensors. Some cameras use a larger sensor including, at the high end, a pricey full-frame sensor compact camera, such as Sony Cyber-shot DSC-RX1, but have capability near that of a DSLR.

A variety of additional features are available depending on the model of the camera. Such features include GPS, compass, barometers and altimeters.

Starting in 2010, some compact digital cameras can take 3D still photos. These 3D compact stereo cameras can capture 3D panoramic photos with dual lens or even a single lens for playback on a 3D TV.

In 2013, Sony released two add-on camera models without display, to be used with a smartphone or tablet, controlled by a mobile application via WiFi.

=== Rugged compacts ===
Rugged compact cameras typically include protection against submersion, hot and cold conditions, shock, and pressure. Terms used to describe such properties include waterproof, freeze-proof, heatproof, shockproof, and crushproof, respectively. Nearly all major camera manufacturers have at least one product in this category. Some are waterproof to a considerable depth up to 100 feet (30 m); others only 10 feet (3 m), but only a few will float. Ruggeds often lack some of the features of ordinary compact camera, but they have video capability and the majority can record sound. Most have image stabilization and built-in flash. Touchscreen LCD and GPS do not work underwater.

=== Action cameras ===

GoPro and other brands offer action cameras that are rugged, small, and can be easily attached to helmets, arms, bicycles, etc. Most have a wide angle and fixed focus and can take still pictures and video, typically with sound.

=== 360-degree cameras ===

The 360-degree camera can take picture or video 360 degrees using two lenses back-to-back and shooting at the same time. Some of the cameras are Ricoh Theta S, Nikon Keymission 360 and Samsung Gear 360. Nico360 was launched in 2016 and claimed as the world&#x27;s smallest 360-degree camera with size 46 x 46 x 28 mm (1.8 x 1.8 x 1.1 in) and price less than $200. With virtual reality mode built-in stitching, Wifi, and Bluetooth, live streaming can be done. Due to it also being water resistant, the Nico360 can be used as action camera.

There are tend that action cameras have capabilities to shoot 360 degrees with at least 4K resolution.

=== Bridge cameras ===

Bridge cameras physically resemble DSLRs, and are sometimes called DSLR-shape or DSLR-like. They provide some similar features but, like compacts, they use a fixed lens and a small sensor. Some compact cameras have also PSAM mode. Most use live preview to frame the image. Their usual autofocus is by the same contrast-detect mechanism as compacts, but many bridge cameras have a manual focus mode and some have a separate focus ring for greater control.

The big physical size and small sensor allow superzoom and wide aperture. Bridge cameras generally include an image stabilization system to enable longer handheld exposures, sometimes better than DSLR for low light conditions.

As of 2014, bridge cameras come in two principal classes in terms of sensor size, firstly the more traditional 1/2.3&quot; sensor (as measured by image sensor format) which gives more flexibility in lens design and allows for handholdable zoom from 20 to 24 mm (35 mm equivalent) wide angle all the way up to over 1000 mm supertele, and secondly a 1&quot; sensor that allows better image quality particularly in low light (higher ISO) but puts greater constraints on lens design, resulting in zoom lenses that stop at 200 mm (constant aperture, e.g. Sony RX10) or 400 mm (variable aperture, e.g. Panasonic Lumix FZ1000) equivalent, corresponding to an optical zoom factor of roughly 10 to 15.

Some bridge cameras have a lens thread to attach accessories such as wide-angle or telephoto converters as well as filters such as UV or Circular Polarizing filter and lens hoods. The scene is composed by viewing the display or the electronic viewfinder (EVF). Most have a slightly longer shutter lag than a DSLR. Many of these cameras can store images in a raw format in addition to supporting JPEG. The majority have a built-in flash, but only a few have a hotshoe.

In bright sun, the quality difference between a good compact camera and a digital SLR is minimal but bridge cameras are more portable, cost less and have a greater zoom ability. Thus a bridge camera may better suit outdoor daytime activities, except when seeking professional-quality photos.

=== Mirrorless interchangeable-lens cameras ===

In late 2008, a new type of camera emerged, called a &quot;mirrorless interchangeable-lens camera&quot;. It is technically a DSLR camera that does not require a reflex mirror, a key component of the former. While a typical DSLR has a mirror that reflects light from the lens up to the optical viewfinder, in a mirrorless camera, there is no optical viewfinder. The image sensor is exposed to light at all times, giving the user a digital preview of the image either on the built-in rear LCD screen or an electronic viewfinder (EVF).

These are simpler and more compact than DSLRs due to not having a lens reflex system. MILCs, or mirrorless cameras for short, come with various sensor sizes depending on the brand and manufacturer, these include: a small 1/2.3 inch sensor, as is commonly used in bridge cameras such as the original Pentax Q (more recent Pentax Q versions have a slightly larger 1/1.7 inch sensor); a 1-inch sensor; a Micro Four Thirds sensor; an APS-C sensor found in Sony NEX series and α &quot;DSLR-likes&quot;, Fujifilm X series, Pentax K-01, and Canon EOS M; and some, such as the Sony α7, use a full frame (35 mm) sensor, with the Hasselblad X1D being the first medium format mirrorless camera. Some MILCs have a separate electronic viewfinder to compensate the lack of an optical one. In other cameras, the back display is used as the primary viewfinder in the same way as in compact cameras. One disadvantage of mirrorless cameras compared to a typical DSLR is its battery life due to the energy consumption of the electronic viewfinder, but this can be mitigated by a setting inside the camera in some models. Many mirrorless cameras have a hotshoe.

Olympus and Panasonic released many Micro Four Thirds cameras with interchangeable lenses that are fully compatible with each other without any adapter, while others have proprietary mounts. In 2014, Kodak released its first Micro Four Third system camera.

, mirrorless cameras are fast becoming appealing to both amateurs and professionals alike due to their simplicity, compatibility with some DSLR lenses, and features that match most DSLRs today.

=== Modular cameras ===
While most digital cameras with interchangeable lenses feature a lens-mount of some kind, there are also a number of modular cameras, where the shutter and sensor are incorporated into the lens module.

The first such modular camera was the Minolta Dimâge V in 1996, followed by the Minolta Dimâge EX 1500 in 1998 and the Minolta MetaFlash 3D 1500 in 1999. In 2009, Ricoh released the Ricoh GXR modular camera.

At CES 2013, Sakar International announced the Polaroid iM1836, an 18MP camera with 1&quot;-sensor with interchangeable sensor-lens. An adapter for Micro Four Thirds, Nikon and K-mount lenses was planned to ship with the camera.

There are also a number of add-on camera modules for smartphones, they are called &quot;lens-style&quot; cameras (lens camera or smart lens). They contain all the essential components of a digital camera inside a DSLR lens-shaped module, hence the name, but lack any sort of viewfinder and most controls of a regular camera. Instead, they are connected wirelessly and/or mounted to a smartphone to be used as its display output and operate the camera&#x27;s various controls.

Lens-style cameras include:
* Sony Cyber-shot QX series &quot;Smart Lens&quot; or &quot;SmartShot&quot; cameras, announced and released in mid 2013 with the Cyber-shot DSC-QX10. In January 2014, a firmware update was announced for the DSC-QX10 and DSC-QX100. In September 2014, Sony announced the Cyber-shot DSC-QX30 as well as the Alpha ILCE-QX1, the former an ultrazoom with a built-in 30x optical zoom lens, the latter opting for an interchangeable Sony E-mount instead of a built-in lens.
* Kodak PixPro smart lens camera series, announced in 2014. These include: the 5X optical zoom SL5, 10X optical zoom SL10, and the 25X optical zoom SL25; all featuring 16MP sensors and 1080p video recording, except for the SL5 which caps at 720p.
* ViviCam IU680 smart lens camera from Sakar-owned brand, Vivitar, announced in 2014.
* Olympus Air A01 lens camera, announced in 2014 and released in 2015, the lens camera is an open platform with an Android operating system and can detach into 2 parts (sensor module and lens), just like the Sony QX1, and all compatible Micro Four Thirds lenses can then be attached to the built-in lens mount of the camera&#x27;s sensor module.

=== Digital single-lens reflex cameras (DSLR) ===

Digital single-lens reflex cameras (DSLR) is a camera with a digital sensor that utilizes a reflex mirror to split or direct light into the viewfinder to produce an image. The reflex mirror finds the image by blocking light to the camera&#x27;s sensor and then reflecting it into the camera&#x27;s pentaprism which allows it to be seen through the viewfinder. When the shutter release is fully pressed the reflex mirror pulls out horizontally below the pentaprism briefly darkening the viewfinder and then opening up the sensor for exposure which creates the photo. The digital image is produced by the sensor which is an array of photoreceptors on a microchip capable of recording light values. Many modern DSLRs offer the ability for &quot;live view&quot; or the framing of the subject emitted from the sensor onto a digital screen, and many have a hotshoe.

The sensor also known as a full-frame sensor is much larger than the other types, typically 18mm to 36mm on the diagonal (crop factor 2, 1.6, or 1). The larger sensor permits more light to be received by each pixel; this, combined with the relatively large lenses provides superior low-light performance. For the same field of view and the same aperture, a larger sensor gives shallower focus. DSLRs can equip interchangeable lenses for versatility by removing it from the lens mount of the camera, typically a silver ring on the front side of DSLRs. These lenses work in tandem with the mechanics of the DSLR to adjust aperture and focus. Autofocus is accomplished using sensors in the mirror box and on most modern lenses can be activated from the lens itself which will trigger upon shutter release.

=== Digital Still Cameras (DSC) ===
Digital Still Camera (DSC), such as the Sony DSC cameras, is a type of camera that does not use a reflex mirror. DSCs are like point-and-shoot cameras and are the most common type of cameras, due to their comfortable price and its quality.

Here are a list of DSCs: List of Sony Cyber-shot cameras

=== Fixed-mirror DSLT cameras ===

Cameras with fixed semi-transparent mirrors, also known as DSLT cameras, such as the Sony SLT cameras, are single-lens without a moving reflex mirror as in a conventional DSLR. A semi-transparent mirror transmits some of the light to the image sensor and reflects some of the light along the path to a pentaprism/pentamirror which then goes to an optical view finder (OVF) as is done with a reflex mirror in DSLR cameras. The total amount of light is not changed, just some of the light travels one path and some of it travels the other. The consequences are that DSLT cameras should shoot a half stop differently from DSLR. One advantage of using a DSLT camera is the blind moments a DSLR user experiences while the reflecting mirror is moved to send the light to the sensor instead of the viewfinder do not exist for DSLT cameras. Because there is no time at which light is not traveling along both paths, DSLT cameras get the benefit of continuous auto-focus tracking. This is especially beneficial for burst-mode shooting in low-light conditions and also for tracking when taking video.

=== Digital rangefinders ===
A rangefinder is a device to measure subject distance, with the intent to adjust the focus of a camera&#x27;s objective lens accordingly (open-loop controller). The rangefinder and lens focusing mechanism may or may not be coupled. In common parlance, the term &quot;rangefinder camera&quot; is interpreted very narrowly to denote manual-focus cameras with a visually-read out optical rangefinder based on parallax. Most digital cameras achieve focus through analysis of the image captured by the objective lens and distance estimation, if it is provided at all, is only a byproduct of the focusing process (closed-loop controller).

=== Line-scan camera systems ===

A line-scan camera traditionally has a single row of pixel sensors, instead of a matrix of them. The lines are continuously fed to a computer that joins them to each other and makes an image. This is most commonly done by connecting the camera output to a frame grabber which resides in a PCI slot of an industrial computer. The frame grabber acts to buffer the image and sometimes provide some processing before delivering to the computer software for processing. Industrial processes often require height and width measurements performed by digital line-scan systems.

Multiple rows of sensors may be used to make colored images, or to increase sensitivity by TDI (time delay and integration).

Many industrial applications require a wide field of view. Traditionally maintaining consistent light over large 2D areas is quite difficult. With a line scan camera all that is necessary is to provide even illumination across the &quot;line&quot; currently being viewed by the camera. This makes sharp pictures of objects that pass the camera at high speed.

Such cameras are also commonly used to make photo finishes, to determine the winner when multiple competitors cross the finishing line at nearly the same time. They can also be used as industrial instruments for analyzing fast processes.

Line-scan cameras are also extensively used in imaging from satellites (see push broom scanner). In this case the row of sensors is perpendicular to the direction of satellite motion. Line-scan cameras are widely used in scanners. In this case, the camera moves horizontally.

=== Superzoom cameras ===
Digital superzoom cameras are digital cameras that can zoom in very far. These superzoom cameras are suitable for people who have nearsightedness.

The HX series is a series containing Sony&#x27;s superzoom cameras like HX20V, HX90V and the newest HX99. HX stands for HyperXoom.

=== Light-field camera ===
This type of digital camera captures information about the light field emanating from a scene; that is, the intensity of light in a scene, and also the direction that the light rays are traveling in space. This contrasts with a conventional digital camera, which records only light intensity.

=== Event camera ===
Instead of measuring the intensity of light over some predetermined time interval (the exposure time), event cameras detect when the intensity of light changes by some threshold for each pixel independently, usually with microsecond precision.

== Integration into other devices ==
Many devices have a built-in digital camera, including, for example, smartphones, mobile phones, PDAs and laptop computers. Built-in cameras generally store the images in the JPEG file format, although cameras in Apple&#x27;s iPhone line have used the HEIC format since 2017. 

Mobile phones incorporating digital cameras were introduced in Japan in 2001 by J-Phone. In 2003 camera phones outsold stand-alone digital cameras, and in 2006 they outsold film and digital stand-alone cameras. Five billion camera phones were sold in five years, and by 2007 more than half of the installed base of all mobile phones were camera phones. Sales of separate cameras peaked in 2008.

== Notable digital camera manufacturers ==
There are many manufacturers that lead in the production of digital cameras (commonly DSLRs). Each brand embodies different mission statements that differ them from each other outside of the physical technology that they produce. While the majority of manufacturers share modern features amongst their production of cameras, some specialize in specific details either physically on camera or within the system and image quality. 

== Market trends ==
Sales of traditional digital cameras have declined due to the increasing use of smartphones for casual photography, which also enable easier manipulation and sharing of photos through the use of apps and web-based services. &quot;Bridge cameras&quot;, in contrast, have held their ground with functionality that most smartphone cameras lack, such as optical zoom and other advanced features. DSLRs have also lost ground to Mirrorless interchangeable-lens camera (MILC)s offering the same sensor size in a smaller camera. A few expensive ones use a full-frame sensor, just like DSLR professional cameras.

In response to the convenience and flexibility of smartphone cameras, some manufacturers produced &quot;smart&quot; digital cameras that combine features of traditional cameras with those of a smartphone. In 2012, Nikon and Samsung released the Coolpix S800c and Galaxy Camera, the first two digital cameras to run the Android operating system. Since this software platform is used in many smartphones, they can integrate with some of the same services (such as e-mail attachments, social networks and photo sharing sites) that smartphones do and use other Android-compatible software.

In an inversion, some phone makers have introduced smartphones with cameras designed to resemble traditional digital cameras. Nokia released the 808 PureView and Lumia 1020 in 2012 and 2013; the two devices respectively run the Symbian and Windows Phone operating systems, and both include a 41-megapixel camera (along with a camera grip attachment for the latter). Similarly, Samsung introduced the Galaxy S4 Zoom, having a 16-megapixel camera and 10x optical zoom, combining traits from the Galaxy S4 Mini with the Galaxy Camera. Panasonic Lumix DMC-CM1 is an Android KitKat 4.4 smartphone with 20MP, 1&quot; sensor, the largest sensor for a smartphone ever, with Leica fixed lens equivalent of 28 mm at F2.8, can take RAW image and 4K video, has 21 mm thickness. Furthermore, in 2018 Huawei P20 Pro is an android Oreo 8.1 has triple Leica lenses in the back of the smartphone with 40MP 1/1.7&quot; RGB sensor as first lens, 20MP 1/2.7&quot; monochrome sensor as second lens and 8MP 1/4&quot; RGB sensor with 3x optical zoom as third lens. Combination of first lens and second lens will produce bokeh image with larger high dynamic range, whereas combination of mega pixel first lens and optical zoom will produce maximum 5x digital zoom without loss of quality by reducing the image size to 8MP.

After a big dip of sales in 2012, consumer digital camera sales declined again in 2013 by 36 percent. In 2011, compact digital cameras sold 10 million per month. In 2013, sales fell to about 4 million per month. DSLR and MILC sales also declined in 2013 by 10–15% after almost ten years of double digit growth.
Worldwide unit sales of digital cameras is continuously declining from 148 million in 2011 to 58 million in 2015 and tends to decrease more in the following years.

Film camera sales hit their peak at about 37 million units in 1997, while digital camera sales began in 1989. By 2008, the film camera market had died and digital camera sales hit their peak at 121 million units in 2010. In 2002, cell phones with an integrated camera had been introduced and in 2003 the cell phone with an integrated camera had sold 80 million units per year. By 2011, cell phones with an integrated camera were selling hundreds of millions per year, which were causing a decline in digital cameras. In 2015, digital camera sales were 35 million units or only less than a third of digital camera sales numbers at their peak and also slightly less than film camera sold number at their peak.

== Connectivity ==

=== Transferring photos ===
Many digital cameras can connect directly to a computer to transfer data:-
* Early cameras used the PC serial port. USB is now the most widely used method (most cameras are viewable as USB mass storage), though some have a FireWire port. Some cameras use USB PTP mode for connection instead of USB MSC; some offer both modes.

* Other cameras use wireless connections, via Bluetooth or IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi, such as the Kodak EasyShare One. Wi-Fi integrated Memory cards (SDHC, SDXC) can transmit stored images, video and other files to computers or smartphones. Mobile operating systems such as Android allow automatic upload and backup or sharing of images over Wi-Fi to photo sharing and cloud services.

* Cameras with integrated Wi-Fi or specific Wi-Fi adapters mostly allow camera control, especially shutter release, exposure control and more (tethering) from computer or smartphone apps additionally to the transfer of media data.
* Cameraphones and some high-end stand-alone digital cameras also use cellular networks to connect for sharing images. The most common standard on cellular networks is the MMS Multimedia Messaging Service, commonly called &quot;picture messaging&quot;. The second method with smartphones is to send a picture as an email attachment. Many old cameraphones, however, do not support email.

A common alternative is the use of a card reader which may be capable of reading several types of storage media, as well as high speed transfer of data to the computer. Use of a card reader also avoids draining the camera battery during the download process. An external card reader allows convenient direct access to the images on a collection of storage media. But if only one storage card is in use, moving it back and forth between the camera and the reader can be inconvenient. Many computers have a card reader built in, at least for SD cards.

=== Printing photos ===

Many modern cameras support the PictBridge standard, which allows them to send data directly to a PictBridge-capable printer without the need for a computer. PictBridge uses PTP to transfer images and control information.

Wireless connectivity can also provide for printing photos without a cable connection.
An &quot;instant-print camera&quot;, is a digital camera with a built-in printer. This confers a similar functionality as an instant camera which uses instant film to quickly generate a physical photograph. Such non-digital cameras were popularized by Polaroid with the SX-70 in 1972.

=== Displaying photos ===

Many digital cameras include a video output port. Usually sVideo, it sends a standard-definition video signal to a television, allowing the user to show one picture at a time. Buttons or menus on the camera allow the user to select the photo, advance from one to another, or automatically send a &quot;slide show&quot; to the TV.

HDMI has been adopted by many high-end digital camera makers, to show photos in their high-resolution quality on an HDTV.

In January 2008, Silicon Image announced a new technology for sending video from mobile devices to a television in digital form. MHL sends pictures as a video stream, up to 1080p resolution, and is compatible with HDMI.

Some DVD recorders and television sets can read memory cards used in cameras; alternatively several types of flash card readers have TV output capability.

== Weather-sealing and waterproofing ==
Cameras can be equipped with a varying amount of environmental sealing to provide protection against splashing water, moisture (humidity and fog), dust and sand, or complete waterproofness to a certain depth and for a certain duration. The latter is one of the approaches to allow underwater photography, the other approach being the use of waterproof housings. Many waterproof digital cameras are also shockproof and resistant to low temperatures.

Some waterproof cameras can be fitted with a waterproof housing to increase the operational depth range. The Olympus &#x27;Tough&#x27; range of compact cameras is an example.

== Modes ==
Many digital cameras have preset modes for different applications. Within the constraints of correct exposure various parameters can be changed, including exposure, aperture, focusing, light metering, white balance, and equivalent sensitivity. For example, a portrait might use a wider aperture to render the background out of focus, and would seek out and focus on a human face rather than other image content.

Few cameras are equipped with a voice note (audio-only) recording feature.

=== Scene modes ===
Vendors implement a variety scene modes in cameras&#x27; firmwares for various purposes, such as a &quot;landscape mode&quot; which prevents focusing on rainy and/or stained window glass such as a windshield, and a &quot;sports mode&quot; which reduces motion blur of moving subjects by reducing exposure time with the help of increased light sensitivity. Firmwares may be equipped with the ability to select a suitable scene mode automatically through artificial intelligence.

== Image data storage ==


Many camera phones and most stand alone digital cameras store image data in flash memory cards or other removable media. Most stand-alone cameras use SD format, while a few use CompactFlash, CFexpress or other types. In January 2012, a faster XQD card format was announced. In early 2014, some high end cameras have two hot-swappable memory slots. Photographers can swap one of the memory card with camera-on. Each memory slot can accept either Compact Flash or SD Card. All new Sony cameras also have two memory slots, one for its Memory Stick and one for SD Card, but not hot-swapable.

The approximate count of remaining photos until space exhaustion is calculated by the firmware throughout use and indicated in the viewfinder, to prepare the user for an impending necessary hot swap of the memory card, and/or file offload.

A few cameras used other removable storage such as Microdrives (very small hard disk drives), CD single (185 MB), and 3.5&quot; floppy disks (e. g. Sony Mavica). Other unusual formats include:
* Onboard (internal) flash memory — Cheap cameras and cameras secondary to the device&#x27;s main use (such as a camera phone). Some have small capacities such as 100 Megabytes and less, where intended use is buffer storage for uninterrupted operation during a memory card hot swap.
* SuperDisk (LS120) used in two Panasonic digital cameras, the PV-SD4090 and PV-SD5000, which allowed them to use both SuperDisk and 3.5&quot; floppy disks
* PC Card hard drives — early professional cameras (discontinued)
* PC Card flash memory cards
* Thermal printer — known only in the Casio Petit Colle ZR-1 and ZR-10 which printed images immediately rather than storing
* Zink technology — printing images immediately rather than storing
*PocketZip — media used in the Agfa ePhoto CL30 Clik!
Most manufacturers of digital cameras do not provide drivers and software to allow their cameras to work with Linux or other free software. Still, many cameras use the standard USB mass storage and/or Media Transfer Protocol, and are thus widely supported. Other cameras are supported by the gPhoto project, and many computers are equipped with a memory card reader.

=== File formats ===
The Joint Photography Experts Group standard (JPEG) is the most common file format for storing image data. Other file types include Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) and various Raw image formats.

Many cameras, especially high-end ones, support a raw image format. A raw image is the unprocessed set of pixel data directly from the camera&#x27;s sensor, often saved in a proprietary format. Adobe Systems has released the DNG format, a royalty-free raw image format used by at least 10 camera manufacturers.

Raw files initially had to be processed in specialized image editing programs, but over time many mainstream editing programs, such as Google&#x27;s Picasa, have added support for raw images. Rendering to standard images from raw sensor data allows more flexibility in making major adjustments without losing image quality or retaking the picture.

Formats for movies are AVI, DV, MPEG, MOV (often containing motion JPEG), WMV, and ASF (basically the same as WMV). Recent formats include MP4, which is based on the QuickTime format and uses newer compression algorithms to allow longer recording times in the same space.

Other formats that are used in cameras (but not for pictures) are the Design Rule for Camera Format (DCF), an ISO specification, used in almost all camera since 1998, which defines an internal file structure and naming. Also used is the Digital Print Order Format (DPOF), which dictates what order images are to be printed in and how many copies. The DCF 1998 defines a logical file system with 8.3 filenames and makes the usage of either FAT12, FAT16, FAT32 or exFAT mandatory for its physical layer in order to maximize platform interoperability.

Most cameras include Exif data that provides metadata about the picture. Exif data may include aperture, exposure time, focal length, date and time taken. Some are able to tag the location.

=== Directory and file structure ===

In order to guarantee interoperability, DCF specifies the file system for image and sound files to be used on formatted DCF media (like removable or non-removable memory) as FAT12, FAT16, FAT32, or exFAT. Media with a capacity of more than 2 GB must be formatted using FAT32 or exFAT.

The filesystem in a digital camera contains a DCIM (Digital Camera IMages) directory, which can contain multiple subdirectories with names such as &quot;123ABCDE&quot; that consist of a unique directory number (in the range 100...999) and five alphanumeric characters, which may be freely chosen and often refer to a camera maker. These directories contain files with names such as &quot;ABCD1234.JPG&quot; that consist of four alphanumeric characters (often &quot;100_&quot;, &quot;DSC0&quot;, &quot;DSCF&quot;, &quot;IMG_&quot;, &quot;MOV_&quot;, or &quot;P000&quot;), followed by a number. Handling of directories with possibly user-created duplicate numbers may vary among camera firmwares.

DCF 2.0 adds support for DCF optional files recorded in an optional color space (that is, Adobe RGB rather than sRGB). Such files must be indicated by a leading &quot;_&quot; (as in &quot;_DSC&quot; instead of &quot;100_&quot; or &quot;DSC0&quot;).

=== Thumbnail files ===
To enable loading many images in miniature view quickly and efficiently, and to retain meta data, some vendors&#x27; firmwares generate accompanying low-resolution thumbnail files for videos and raw photos. For example, those of Canon cameras end with codice_1. JPEG can already store a thumbnail image standalone.

== Batteries ==

Digital cameras have become smaller over time, resulting in an ongoing need to develop a battery small enough to fit in the camera and yet able to power it for a reasonable length of time.

Digital cameras utilize either proprietary or standard consumer batteries. , most cameras use proprietary lithium-ion batteries while some use standard AA batteries or primarily use a proprietary Lithium-ion rechargeable battery pack but have an optional AA battery holder available.

=== Proprietary ===

The most common class of battery used in digital cameras is proprietary battery formats. These are built to a manufacturer&#x27;s custom specifications. Almost all proprietary batteries are lithium-ion. In addition to being available from the OEM, aftermarket replacement batteries are commonly available for most camera models.

=== Standard consumer batteries ===
Digital cameras that utilize off-the-shelf batteries are typically designed to be able to use both single-use disposable and rechargeable batteries, but not with both types in use at the same time. The most common off-the-shelf battery size used is AA. CR2, CR-V3 batteries, and AAA batteries are also used in some cameras. The CR2 and CR-V3 batteries are lithium based, intended for a single use. Rechargeable RCR-V3 lithium-ion batteries are also available as an alternative to non-rechargeable CR-V3 batteries.

Some battery grips for DSLRs come with a separate holder to accommodate AA cells as an external power source.

== Conversion of film cameras to digital ==
When digital cameras became common, many photographers asked whether their film cameras could be converted to digital. The answer was not immediately clear, as it differed among models. For the majority of 35 mm film cameras the answer is no, the reworking and cost would be too great, especially as lenses have been evolving as well as cameras. For most a conversion to digital, to give enough space for the electronics and allow a liquid crystal display to preview, would require removing the back of the camera and replacing it with a custom built digital unit.

Many early professional SLR cameras, such as the Kodak DCS series, were developed from 35 mm film cameras. The technology of the time, however, meant that rather than being digital &quot;backs&quot; the bodies of these cameras were mounted on large, bulky digital units, often bigger than the camera portion itself. These were factory built cameras, however, not aftermarket conversions.

A notable exception is the Nikon E2 and Nikon E3, using additional optics to convert the 35 mm format to a 2/3 CCD-sensor.

A few 35 mm cameras have had digital camera backs made by their manufacturer, Leica being a notable example with the Leica R8–R9. Medium format and large format cameras (those using film stock greater than 35 mm), have a low unit production, and typical digital backs for them cost over $10,000. These cameras also tend to be highly modular, with handgrips, film backs, winders, and lenses available separately to fit various needs.

The very large sensor these backs use leads to enormous image sizes. For example, Phase One&#x27;s P45 39 MP image back creates a single TIFF image of size up to 224.6 MB, and even greater pixel counts are available. Medium format digitals such as this are geared more towards studio and portrait photography than their smaller DSLR counterparts; the ISO speed in particular tends to have a maximum of 400, versus 6400 for some DSLR cameras. (Canon EOS-1D Mark IV and Nikon D3S have ISO 12800 plus Hi-3 ISO 102400 with the Canon EOS-1Dx&#x27;s ISO of 204800).

=== Digital camera backs ===
In the industrial and high-end professional photography market, some camera systems use modular (removable) image sensors. For example, some medium format SLR cameras, such as the Mamiya 645D series, allow installation of either a digital camera back or a traditional photographic film back.

* Area array
** CCD
** CMOS
* Linear array
** CCD (monochrome)
** 3-strip CCD with color filters

Linear array cameras are also called scan backs.

* Single-shot
* Multi-shot (three-shot, usually)

Most earlier digital camera backs used linear array sensors, moving vertically to digitize the image. Many of them only capture grayscale images. The relatively long exposure times, in the range of seconds or even minutes generally limit scan backs to studio applications, where all aspects of the photographic scene are under the photographer&#x27;s control.

Some other camera backs use CCD arrays similar to typical cameras. These are called single-shot backs.

Since it is much easier to manufacture a high-quality linear CCD array with only thousands of pixels than a CCD matrix with millions, very high resolution linear CCD camera backs were available much earlier than their CCD matrix counterparts. For example, you could buy an (albeit expensive) camera back with over 7,000 pixel horizontal resolution in the mid-1990s. However, , it is still difficult to buy a comparable CCD matrix camera of the same resolution. Rotating line cameras, with about 10,000 color pixels in its sensor line, are able, , to capture about 120,000 lines during one full 360 degree rotation, thereby creating a single digital image of 1,200 Megapixels.

Most modern digital camera backs use CCD or CMOS matrix sensors. The matrix sensor captures the entire image frame at once, instead of incrementing scanning the frame area through the prolonged exposure. For example, Phase One produces a 39 million pixel digital camera back with a 49.1 x 36.8 mm CCD in 2008. This CCD array is a little smaller than a frame of 120 film and much larger than a 35 mm frame (36 x 24 mm). In comparison, consumer digital cameras use arrays ranging from 36 x 24 mm (full frame on high end consumer DSLRs) to 1.28 x 0.96 mm (on camera phones) CMOS sensor.

<text>John Anthony Bellairs (January 17, 1938 – March 8, 1991) was an American author best known for his fantasy novel &quot;The Face in the Frost&quot; and many Gothic mystery novels for children featuring the characters Lewis Barnavelt, Rose Rita Pottinger, Johnny Dixon, and Anthony Monday. Most of his books were illustrated by Edward Gorey. At the time of his death, Bellairs&#x27; books had sold a quarter-million copies in hard cover and more than a million and a half copies in paperback.

==Biography==
=== Early life and education ===
Bellairs was born in Marshall, Michigan, the son of Virginia (Monk) and Frank Edward Bellairs, who ran a cigar store and bowling alley in Marshall. He was raised a strict Roman Catholic and initially planned to become a priest. His hometown inspired the fictional town of New Zebedee, Michigan, where he set his trilogy about Lewis Barnavelt and Rose Rita Pottinger. Shy, overweight, and often bullied as a child, he had become a voracious reader and a self-described &quot;bottomless pit of useless information&quot; by the time he graduated from Marshall High School and entered the University of Notre Dame in 1955.

Bellairs graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English &quot;magna cum laude&quot; from the University of Notre Dame in 1959. At Notre Dame, he competed in the College Bowl and wrote a regular humor column for the student magazine &quot;Scholastic&quot;. Bellairs went on to receive a Master of Arts degree in English from the University of Chicago in 1960. He received a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship in 1959.

=== Career and interests ===
Bellairs taught English at the College of Saint Teresa (1963–65), Shimer College (1966–67), Emmanuel College (1968–69), and Merrimack College (1969–71) before turning full-time to writing in 1971. During the late 1960s, he spent six months living and writing in Bristol, United Kingdom, where he began writing &quot;The Face in the Frost&quot;. Bristol would later feature in his 1990 novel &quot;The Secret of the Underground Room&quot;.

His personal interests included archaeology, architecture, history, Latin, baseball, kitschy antiques, bad poetry, visits to the UK, and trivia of all kinds. His favorite authors included Charles Dickens, Henry James, M.R. James, Garrett Mattingly, and C. V. Wedgwood.

Alongside Christopher Tolkien, Bellairs was a guest of honor at the 18th Annual Mythopoeic Conference at Marquette University in 1987, hosted by the Mythopoeic Society.

=== Death and legacy ===
Bellairs died suddenly of cardiovascular disease at his home in Haverhill, Massachusetts, on March 8, 1991, at the age of 53. He was survived by his ex-wife, Priscilla (Braids) Bellairs, whom he had married on June 24, 1968, and their son Frank J. Bellairs. Frank Bellairs died in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on August 19, 1999, at the age of 29. Priscilla Bellairs lives in Newburyport.

In 1992, a historical marker was placed in front of the historic Cronin House in Bellairs&#x27;s hometown of Marshall, Michigan. Built in 1870 for local merchant Jeremiah Cronin, this imposing Italianate mansion with its 60-foot tower had inspired the titular house of his 1973 book.

Bellairs was inducted into the Haverhill Citizens Hall of Fame in 2000.

== Writings ==

=== Books for adults ===
Bellairs&#x27; first published work, &quot;St. Fidgeta and Other Parodies&quot; (1966), is a collection of short stories satirizing the rites and rituals of Second Vatican Council-era Catholicism. The title story of St. Fidgeta grew out of humorous stories Bellairs made up and shared with friends while living in Chicago. After committing one such story to paper, he sent it to the Chicago-based Catholic magazine &quot;The Critic&quot;, which published the story in summer 1965. The following year, the hagiography of St. Fidgeta was supplemented by eleven other humorous stories, including an essay on lesser-known popes of antiquity, a cathedral constructed over the course of centuries, and a spoof letter from a modern-day Xavier Rynne about the escapades at the fictional Third Vatican Council. &quot;Library Journal&quot; hailed &quot;St. Fidgeta&quot; as &quot;religious burlesque&quot; that delivered &quot;strokes of inspired foolishness.&quot; A writer for the &quot;National Catholic Reporter&quot; called it a &quot;gem.&quot;

&quot;The Pedant and the Shuffly&quot;, his second book, is a short illustrated fable featuring the evil magician Snodrog (the titular pedant), who ensnares his victims with inescapable (and nonsensical) logic until the kindly sorcerer, Sir Bertram Crabtree-Gore, enlists the help of a magical Shuffly to defeat Snodrog. The book was originally published in 1968 and rereleased in 2001 and 2009.

Bellairs undertook his third book, &quot;The Face in the Frost&quot; (1969), while living in Britain and after reading J.R.R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Bellairs said of his third book: &quot;&quot;The Face in the Frost&quot; was an attempt to write in the Tolkien manner. I was much taken by &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and wanted to do a modest work on those lines. In reading the latter book I was struck by the fact that Gandalf was not much of a person—just a good guy. So I gave Prospero, my wizard, most of my phobias and crotchets. It was simply meant as entertainment and any profundity will have to be read in.&quot; Writing in 1973, Lin Carter described &quot;The Face in the Frost&quot; as one of the three best fantasy novels to appear since &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Carter stated that Bellairs was planning a sequel to &quot;The Face in the Frost&quot; at the time. An unfinished sequel titled &quot;The Dolphin Cross&quot; was included in the anthology &quot;Magic Mirrors&quot; (New England Science Fiction Association Press, 2009).

=== Books for children ===
Bellairs&#x27;s next novel was originally written as a contemporary adult fantasy. To improve the novel&#x27;s marketability, his publisher suggested rewriting it as a young readers&#x27; book. The result was &quot;The House with a Clock in Its Walls&quot; (1973), which was named as one of &quot;The New York Times&quot; Outstanding Books of 1973 and nominated for other awards.

Following the success of &quot;The House with a Clock in Its Walls&quot;, Bellairs focused on writing Gothic fantasy adventures aimed at elementary and middle-school children. &quot;I write scary thrillers for kids because I have the imagination of a 10-year-old,&quot; remarked Bellairs. &quot;I love haunted houses, ghosts, witches, mummies, incantations, secret rituals performed by the light of the waning moon, coffins, bones, cemeteries and enchanted objects.&quot; Bellairs also wrote his hometown influenced his creative bent: “In my imagination I repeatedly walk up and down the streets of the beautiful old Michigan town where I grew up. It’s full of old Victorian mansions and history, and it would work on the creative mind of any kid.”

Writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Marilyn Stasio characterized Bellairs&#x27; children&#x27;s books as fast-paced, spooky adventures involving &quot;believable and likeable&quot; characters, generally a child and an older person (usually a &quot;lovable eccentric&quot;) who are friends and must go on adventures and solve a mystery involving supernatural elements such as ghosts and wicked sorcerers. Beyond these supernatural elements, Bellairs&#x27;s novels evoked &quot;a child&#x27;s concern with comfort and security in his &quot;real&quot; world,&quot; addressing childhood fears of abandonment, loneliness, and bullying, as well as coming of age. His stories are described as spooky but ultimately reassuring as the characters conquer evil through friendship.

The books have proved especially popular among middle-grade readers between the ages of 9 and 13 but also have significant young adult and adult readerships.

===Posthumous sequels===

On his death in 1991, Bellairs left behind two unfinished manuscripts and two one-page synopses for future adventures. The Bellairs estate commissioned Brad Strickland to complete the two unfinished manuscripts and to write novels based on the two one-page outlines. These became &quot;The Ghost in the Mirror&quot;; &quot;The Vengeance of the Witch-finder&quot;; &quot;The Drum, the Doll, and the Zombie&quot;; and &quot;The Doom of the Haunted Opera&quot;, respectively. Starting in 1996 with &quot;The Hand of the Necromancer&quot;, Strickland began writing his own stories based on the established characters.

Strickland announced in spring 2005 that new adventures of the Bellairs&#x27; characters were under way, following contract negotiations with the Bellairs&#x27; estate and a two-year absence since his last-published novel. The first of these new adventures was &quot;The House Where Nobody Lived&quot;, which was published on October 5, 2006. All told, thirteen sequels to Bellairs&#x27; books have been written by Strickland.

=== Critical analysis ===
Critical attention has focused on &quot;The House With the Clock in Its Walls&quot; as exemplar of Bellairs&#x27; literary merit and style. Critics have argued that Bellairs wrestled with notions of masculinity, femininity, and queerness in his works. Professor Gary D. Schmidt contended that Bellairs&#x27; Lewis Barnavelt and Rose Rita Pottinger trilogy traced the &quot;emerging acceptance of self&quot; by the two main characters, who struggled with internalized gender norms. Elizabeth Wein analyzes Bellairs&#x27;s use of the haunted house motif in &quot;The House With a Clock in Its Walls&quot;. One of the most substantial academic treatments of Bellairs comes from Dawn Heinecken, professor of women&#x27;s and gender studies at the University of Louisville. Heinecken situates Bellairs in 1970s-era anxieties about gender and changing discourses around masculinity, which were reflected in the era&#x27;s children&#x27;s literature.

Conservative critic William Kilpatrick observed of Bellairs that &quot;While his books are quite frightening, they are well written and undergirded by a moral vision&quot; and recommended them to parents who wish to expose their children to age-appropriate literature that both entertains and edifies. English education instructor Randi Dickson suggested that Bellairs&#x27; oeuvre evidenced greater literary merit than the works of R. L. Stine, whose horror fiction appeals to a youthful demographic similar to Bellairs&#x27;s. Educators have used &quot;The House With the Clock in Its Walls&quot; as a case study for using storytelling techniques to draw in reluctant readers and assigned &quot;The Curse of the Blue Figurine&quot; to students in a book club.

Bellairs&#x27; books have been translated into Czech, French, German, Japanese, Polish, and Spanish, among other languages.

==Illustrators==
Edward Gorey provided cover illustrations and frontispieces for all but three of Bellairs&#x27;s 15 children&#x27;s novels and continued to illustrate the Strickland novels until Gorey&#x27;s death in 2000. The novel &quot;The Beast Under the Wizard&#x27;s Bridge&quot; featured Gorey&#x27;s last published artwork before his death. Despite the strong association of the novels with Gorey&#x27;s illustrations, Bellairs and Gorey never met and probably never even corresponded. The Gorey covers are no longer in print, though some newer editions of the novels still contain interior Gorey illustrations.

S. D. Schindler and Bart Goldman have created cover art for the Strickland books published since 2001.

Marilyn Fitschen provided the covers and illustrations for Bellairs&#x27; first three books: &quot;St Fidgeta and Other Parodies&quot;, &quot;The Pedant and the Shuffly&quot;, and &quot;The Face in the Frost&quot;.

=== Films ===
On November 18, 2011, Mythology Entertainment, founded by Brad Fischer, co-president of production at Phoenix Pictures; Laeta Kalogridis; and James Vanderbilt announced that they hired Eric Kripke, creator of &quot;Supernatural&quot; and &quot;Revolution&quot;, to write and produce a feature film based on John Bellairs&#x27; work through a partnership with John&#x27;s estate. &quot;Jamie, Laeta and I are thrilled to launch Mythology Entertainment and to be partnering with Eric Kripke and the estate of John Bellairs for our first feature project,” Fischer said.“As a kid, Eric was inspired by Bellairs’ work and these books have stayed with him through the years…. As a company, we aspire to be a haven for artists and friends who believe in the power of myth and remember that feeling we all got as kids, when the lights went down and the images came up and anything was possible.”

The film adaptation of Bellairs&#x27; novel &quot;The House with a Clock in Its Walls&quot; stars Jack Black as Uncle Jonathan, Cate Blanchett as Mrs. Zimmerman, and Owen Vaccaro as Lewis Barnavelt, and was directed by Eli Roth. It was released on September 21, 2018.

<doc id="52800" wikidata="Q191798" url="?curid=52800" title="Georges-Eugène Haussmann">
<text>Georges-Eugène Haussmann, commonly known as Baron Haussmann (; 27 March 180911 January 1891), was a French official who served as prefect of Seine (1853–1870), chosen by Emperor Napoleon III to carry out a massive urban renewal programme of new boulevards, parks and public works in Paris commonly referred to as Haussmann&#x27;s renovation of Paris.

Critics forced his resignation for extravagance. His vision of the city defines modern central Paris.

==Biography==
===Origins and early career===
Haussmann was born on 27 March 1809, at 53 Rue du Faubourg-du-Roule, in the Beaujon neighbourhood of Paris, the son of Nicolas-Valentin Haussmann and Ève-Marie-Henriette-Caroline Dentzel, both of German families. His paternal grandfather was a deputy of the Legislative Assembly and National Convention, an administrator of the department of Seine-et-Oise and a commissioner to the army. His maternal grandfather was a general and a deputy of the National Convention: , a baron of Napoleon&#x27;s First Empire.

He began his schooling at the Collège Henri-IV and the Lycée Condorcet in Paris and then began to study law. At the same time, he studied music as a student at the Paris Conservatory, as he was a talented musician. Haussmann joined his father as an insurgent in the July Revolution of 1830, which deposed the Bourbon king Charles X in favor of his cousin, Louis Philippe, Duke of Orléans.

He was married to Octavie de Laharpe on 17 October 1838 in Bordeaux. They had two daughters: Henriette, who married the banker Camille Dollfus in 1860, and Valentine, who married Vicomte Maurice Pernéty, the chief of staff of his department, in 1865. Valentine divorced Pernéty in 1891 and then married Georges Renouard (1843–1897).

On 21 May 1831, Haussmann began his career in public administration. He was named the secretary-general of the prefecture of the Department of Vienne at Poitiers. On 15 June 1832, he became the deputy prefect of Yssingeaux. Despite proving himself as a hard worker and able representative of the government, his arrogance, dictatorial manner, and habit of impeding his superiors led to his being continually passed over for promotion to prefect. He was posted as deputy prefect to the Lot-et-Garonne Department at Nérac on 9 October 1832, the Ariège Department at Saint-Girons on 19 February 1840, and the Gironde Department at Blaye on 23 November 1841. 

After the 1848 Revolution swept away the July Monarchy, establishing the Second Republic in its place, Haussmann&#x27;s fortunes changed. In 1848, Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte, the nephew of Napoleon Bonaparte, became the first elected president of France. In January 1849, Haussmann travelled to Paris to meet the Minister of the Interior and the new president. He was deemed to be a loyal holdover from the civil service of the July Monarchy, and shortly after their meeting Louis Napoléon granted Haussmann a promotion to prefect of the Var Department at Draguignan. In 1850, he became the prefect of the Yonne Department. In 1851 was appointed as prefect of the Gironde out of Bordeaux.

In 1850, Louis Napoléon started an ambitious project to connect the Louvre to the Hôtel de Ville in Paris, by extending the Rue de Rivoli and create a new park, the Bois de Boulogne, on the outskirts of the city, but he was exasperated by the slow progress made by the incumbent prefect of the Seine, Jean-Jacques Berger. Louis-Napoleon was highly popular, but he was blocked from running for re-election by the constitution of the Second French Republic. While he had a majority of the votes in the legislature at his disposal, he did not have the two-thirds majority needed to change the constitution.

At the end of December 1851, he staged a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;, and in 1852 declared himself Emperor of the French under the title Napoleon III. In November 1852, a plebiscite overwhelmingly approved Napoleon&#x27;s assumption of the throne, and he soon began searching for a new prefect of the Seine to carry out his Paris reconstruction program.

The emperor&#x27;s minister of the interior, Victor de Persigny, interviewed the prefects of Rouen, Lille, Lyon, Marseille and Bordeaux for the Paris post. In his memoirs, he described his interview with Haussmann:

&quot;It was Monsieur Haussmann who impressed me the most. It was a strange thing, but it was less his talents and his remarkable intelligence that appealed to me, but the defects in his character. I had in front of me one of the most extraordinary men of our time; big, strong, vigorous, energetic, and at the same time clever and devious, with a spirit full of resources. This audacious man wasn&#x27;t afraid to show who he was. ... He told me all of his accomplishments during his administrative career, leaving out nothing; he could have talked for six hours without a break, since it was his favourite subject, himself. I wasn&#x27;t at all displeased. ... It seemed to me that he was exactly the man I needed to fight against the ideas and prejudices of a whole school of economics, against devious people and skeptics coming from the Stock Market, against those who were not very scrupulous about their methods; he was just the man. Whereas a gentleman of the most elevated spirit, cleverness, with the most straight and noble character, would inevitably fail, this vigorous athlete ... full of audacity and skill, capable of opposing expedients with better expedients, traps with more clever traps, would certainly succeed. I told him about the Paris works and offered to put him in charge.&quot;

Persigny sent him to Napoleon III with the recommendation that he was exactly the man needed to carry out his renewal plans for Paris. On 22 June 1853, Napoleon made him prefect of the Seine. On 29 June, the emperor gave him the mission of making the city healthier, less congested and grander. Haussmann held this post until 1870.

===Rebuilding of Paris===

Napoleon III and Haussmann launched a series of enormous public works projects in Paris, hiring tens of thousands of workers to improve the sanitation, water supply and traffic circulation of the city. Napoleon III installed a huge map of Paris in his office, marked with coloured lines where he wanted new boulevards to be. To a degree the boulevard system was planned as a mechanism for the easy deployment of troops and artillery, but its main purpose was to help relieve traffic congestion in a dense city and interconnect its landmark buildings. He and Haussmann met almost every day to discuss the projects and overcome the enormous obstacles and opposition they faced as they built the new Paris.

The population of Paris had doubled since 1815, with no increase in its area. To accommodate the growing population and those who would be forced from the centre by the new boulevards and squares Napoleon III planned to build, he issued a decree annexing eleven surrounding communes, and increasing the number of arrondissements from twelve to twenty, which enlarged the city to its modern boundaries.

For the nearly two decades of Napoleon III&#x27;s reign, and for a decade afterwards, most of Paris was an enormous construction site. To bring fresh water to the city, his hydraulic engineer, Eugène Belgrand, built a new aqueduct to bring clean water from the Vanne River in Champagne, and a new huge reservoir near the future Parc Montsouris. These two works increased the water supply of Paris from 87,000 to 400,000 cubic metres of water a day. 

He laid hundreds of kilometres of pipes to distribute the water throughout the city. He built a second network, using the less-clean water from the Ourq and the Seine, to wash the streets and water the new park and gardens. He completely rebuilt the Paris sewers, and installed miles of pipes to distribute gas for thousands of new streetlights along the Paris streets.

Beginning in 1854, in the centre of the city, Haussmann&#x27;s workers tore down hundreds of old buildings and cut eighty kilometres of new avenues, connecting the central points of the city. Buildings along these avenues were required to be the same height and in a similar style, and to be faced with cream-coloured stone, creating the uniform look of Paris boulevards. Victor Hugo mentioned that it was hardly possible to distinguish what the house in front of you was for: theatre, shop or library. Haussmann managed to rebuild the city in 17 years. &quot;On his own estimation the new boulevards and open spaces displaced 350,000 people; ... by 1870 one-fifth of the streets in central Paris were his creation; he had spent ... 2.5 billion francs on the city; ... one in five Parisian workers was employed in the building trade&quot;.
To connect the city with the rest of France, Napoleon III built two new railroad stations: the Gare de Lyon (1855) and the Gare du Nord (1864). He completed Les Halles, the great iron and glass produce market in the centre of the city, and built a new municipal hospital, the Hôtel-Dieu, in the place of crumbling medieval buildings on the Ile de la Cité. The signature architectural landmark was the Paris Opera, the largest theatre in the world, designed by Charles Garnier, crowning the center of Napoleon III&#x27;s new Paris. When the Empress Eugenie saw the model of the opera house, and asked the architect what the style was, Garnier said simply, &quot;Napoleon the Third.&quot;

Napoleon III also wanted to build new parks and gardens for the recreation and relaxation of the Parisians, particularly those in the new neighbourhoods of the expanding city.
Napoleon III&#x27;s new parks were inspired by his memories of the parks in London, especially Hyde Park, where he had strolled and promenaded in a carriage while in exile, but he wanted to build on a much larger scale. Working with Haussmann and Adolphe Alphand, the engineer who headed the new Service of Promenades and Plantations, he laid out a plan for four major parks at the cardinal points of the compass around the city. Thousands of workers and gardeners began to dig lakes, build cascades, plant lawns, flowerbeds, trees, and construct chalets and grottoes. Napoleon III created the Bois de Boulogne (1852–58) to the west of Paris, the Bois de Vincennes (1860–65) to the east, the Parc des Buttes Chaumont (1865–67) to the north, and Parc Montsouris (1865–78) to the south.

In addition to building the four large parks, Haussmann had the city&#x27;s older parks, including Parc Monceau, formerly owned by the Orleans family, and the Jardin du Luxembourg, refurbished and replanted. He created twenty small parks and gardens in the neighbourhoods, as miniature versions of his large parks. Alphand termed these small parks &quot;green and flowering salons.&quot; The intention of Napoleon&#x27;s plan was to have one park in each of the eighty neighbourhoods of Paris, so no one was more than 10 minutes walk from a park. The parks were an immediate success with all classes of Parisians.

===&quot;Baron Haussmann&quot;===
To thank Haussmann for his work, Napoleon III proposed in 1857 to make Haussmann a member of the French Senate and to give him an honorary title, as he had done for some of his generals. Haussmann asked for the title of baron, which, as he said in his memoirs, had been the title of his maternal grandfather, Georges Frédéric, Baron Dentzel, a general under Napoleon I, of whom Haussmann was the only living male descendant. According to his memoirs, he joked that he might consider the title &quot;aqueduc&quot; (a pun on the French words for &#x27;duke&#x27; and &#x27;aqueduct&#x27;) but that no such title existed. This use of &quot;baron&quot;, however, was not officially sanctioned, and he remained, legally, Monsieur Haussmann.

===Downfall===
During the first half of the reign of Napoleon III, the French legislature had little real power. All decisions were made by the Emperor. Beginning in 1860, however, Napoleon decided to liberalise the Empire and give legislators power. The members of the opposition in the parliament increasingly aimed their criticism of Napoleon III at Haussmann, criticising his spending and high-handed attitude toward the parliament.

The cost of the reconstruction projects was also rising rapidly. In December 1858 the Council of State ruled that a property owner whose land was expropriated could retain the land that was not specifically needed for the street, greatly increasing the cost of expropriation. Property owners also became much more clever in claiming higher payments for their buildings, often by creating sham shops and businesses within their buildings. The cost of expropriations jumped from 70 million francs for the first projects to about 230 million francs for the second wave of projects.

In 1858, the Cour des Comptes, which oversaw the finances of the Empire, ruled that the Caisses des Grands Travaux was operating illegally by making &quot;disguised loans&quot; to private companies. The court ruled that such loans had to be approved by the parliament. The parliament was asked to approve a loan of 250 millions francs in 1865, and another 260 million francs in 1869.

The members of the opposition were particularly outraged when in 1866 he took away part of the Luxembourg to make room for the new avenue between the Luxembourg Gardens and the Observatory, and destroyed the old garden nursery which lay between rue Auguste Comte, rue d&#x27;Assas and the avenue de l&#x27;Observatoire. When the Emperor and Empress attended a performance at the Odeon Theater, near the Luxembourg gardens, members of the audience shouted &quot;Dismiss Haussmann!&quot; and jeered the Emperor. Nonetheless, the Emperor stood by Haussmann.
One of the leaders of the parliamentary opposition to Napoleon, Jules Ferry, ridiculed the accounting practices of Haussmann as &quot;Les Comptes fantastiques de Haussmann&quot;, or &quot;The fantastic accounts of Haussmann&quot;, in 1867, a play on words of &quot;Les Contes Fantastiques de Hoffmann&quot;, The Fantastical Tales of Hoffmann. The republican opposition to Napoleon III won many parliamentary seats in the 1869 elections, and increased its criticism of Haussmann. 

Napoleon III gave in to the criticism and named an opposition leader and fierce critic of Haussmann, Emile Ollivier, as his new prime minister. Haussmann was invited to resign. Haussmann refused to resign, and was relieved of his duties by the Emperor. Six months later, during the Franco-German War, Napoleon III was captured by the Germans, and the Empire was overthrown.

In his memoires, Haussmann had this comment on his dismissal: &quot;In the eyes of the Parisians, who like routine in things but are changeable when it comes to people, I committed two great wrongs; over the course of seventeen years I disturbed their daily habits by turning Paris upside down, and they had to look at the same face of the Prefect in the Hotel de Ville. These were two unforgivable complaints.&quot;

After the fall of Napoleon III, Haussmann spent about a year abroad, but he re-entered public life in 1877, when he became Bonapartist deputy for Ajaccio. His later years were occupied with the preparation of his &quot;Mémoires&quot; (three volumes, 1890–1893).

===Death===
Haussmann died in Paris on 11 January 1891 at age 81 and was buried in Père Lachaise Cemetery. His wife, Louise-Octavie de la Harpe, had died just eighteen days earlier. At the time of their deaths, they had resided in an apartment at 12 rue Boissy d&#x27;Anglas, near the Place de la Concorde. The will transferred their estate to the family of their only surviving daughter, Valentine Haussmann. 

==Legacy==

Haussmann&#x27;s plan for Paris inspired the urban planning and creation of similar boulevards, squares and parks in Cairo, Buenos Aires, Brussels, Rome, Vienna, Stockholm, Madrid, and Barcelona. After the Paris International Exposition of 1867, William I, the King of Prussia, carried back to Berlin a large map showing Haussmann&#x27;s projects, which influenced the future planning of that city. 

His work also inspired the City Beautiful Movement in the United States. Frederick Law Olmsted, the designer of Central Park in New York, visited the Bois de Boulogne eight times during his 1859 study trip to Europe, and was also influenced by the innovations of the Parc des Buttes Chaumont. The American architect Daniel Burnham borrowed liberally from Haussmann&#x27;s plan and incorporated the diagonal street designs in his 1909 Plan of Chicago.

Haussmann had been made senator in 1857, member of the Academy of Fine Arts in 1867, and grand cross of the Legion of Honour in 1862. His name is preserved in the Boulevard Haussmann.

==Controversies==

===Financing the reconstruction of Paris===
The reconstruction of the centre of Paris was the largest such public works project ever undertaken in Europe. Never before had a major city been completely rebuilt when it was still intact. London, Rome, Copenhagen and Lisbon had been rebuilt after major fires or earthquakes. Napoleon III began his grand projects when he was prince-president, when the government had a full treasury. In his 1851 plan, he proposed to extend the Rue de Rivoli to connect the Louvre with the Hôtel de Ville, to build a wide new avenue, the Boulevard de Strasbourg on a north-south axis, and to complete the central produce market, Les Halles, long unfinished. 

He approached the Parliament and received authorisation to borrow fifty million francs. The Emperor&#x27;s ambitions were much greater. He wanted to finish the building of the Louvre and to create an enormous new park, the Bois de Boulogne, to the west of Paris. His prefect of the Seine, Berger, protested that Paris did not have the money. At this point, Napoleon dismissed Berger and hired Haussmann, and Haussmann looked for a better way to finance his projects.

Napoleon III was especially anxious to finish the extension of rue de Rivoli from the Louvre to the Hotel de Ville, before the opening of the Paris Universal Exposition of 1855. Napoleon III demanded the construction of a new luxury hotel, to house his imperial guests during the Exposition. Napoleon III and Haussmann turned for funding to two Parisian bankers, Emile Pereire and Isaac Pereire, who had created a bank called Crédit Mobilier.

In December 1854, with no time to lose before the opening of the exposition, the Pereire brothers created a new company to construct the street and the hotel. They sold 240,000 shares for one hundred francs each, with 106,665 shares purchased by Credit Mobilier, 42,220 by the Pereire brothers, and the rest to private investors. In 1850 and 1851, at Napoleon&#x27;s request, new laws were passed making it easier for Paris to expropriate private land for public purposes. They allowed the city to expropriate, in the public interest, land for new streets, and all of the building sites on both sides of the new streets, an asset of enormous value.

The government expropriated the land, with buildings, that it needed to build the new street and hotel. The owners were paid a price set by an arbitration board. The government then sold the land and buildings to the company established by the Pereire brothers, which tore down the old buildings, constructed a new street, sidewalks and a new square, the Place du Palais Royale. They built new buildings along the new street, and sold them or rented them to new owners.

They constructed the Hotel du Louvre, one of the largest buildings in the city and one of the first modern luxury hotels in Paris. The company also built rows of luxury shops under a covered arcade along the Rue de Rivoli and around the hotel, which they rented to shopkeepers. Construction began immediately. Three thousand workers laboured both day and night for two years to complete the street and hotel, which were finished in time for the Exposition.
This was the basic method adopted by Haussmann to finance the reconstruction of Paris. The government expropriated the old buildings, compensated the owners, and private companies built the new streets and buildings, following the standards set by Haussmann. The private companies were often paid for the construction work they did, with city land, which they could then develop and sell.
In 1854, the Parliament approved another loan of sixty million francs, but Haussmann needed far more for his future projects. On 14 November 1858, Napoleon and Haussmann created the &quot;Caisse des travaux de la Ville&quot;, specifically to finance the reconstruction projects. It borrowed money at a higher rate of interest than regular city bonds, and used the money to pay private companies, such as that of Pereire brothers, to rebuild the city. &quot;It was a great relief for the city&#x27;s finances,&quot; Haussmann wrote later in his &quot;Memoirs&quot; &quot;which allowed the city to carry out several grand operations at the same time, with rapid execution, in short more economically.&quot; It functioned entirely independently of the parliament, which greatly irritated the members of parliament.

===Criticism of the renovation===
Haussmann spent 2.5 billion francs on rebuilding Paris, a sum that staggered his critics. Jules Ferry and other political rivals of Napoleon alleged that Haussmann had recklessly squandered money, and planned poorly. They alleged he had falsified accounts. While Napoleon had hired Haussmann, the political attacks were so intense that he forced Haussmann to become a scapegoat, hoping his resignation would satisfy the bourgeois parties which had become increasingly angered during the economic depression of the late 1860s.

Haussmann&#x27;s plans, with their radical redevelopment, coincided with a time of intense political activity in Paris. Many Parisians were troubled by the destruction of &quot;old roots&quot;. Historian Robert Herbert says that &quot;the impressionist movement depicted this loss of connection in such paintings as Manet&#x27;s &quot;A Bar at the Folies-Bergère&quot;.&quot; The subject of the painting is talking to a man, seen in the mirror behind her, but seems disengaged. According to Herbert, this is a symptom of living in Paris at this time: the citizens became detached from one another. &quot;The continuous destruction of physical Paris led to a destruction of social Paris as well.&quot; The poet Charles Baudelaire witnessed these changes and wrote the poem &quot;The Swan&quot; in response. The poem is a lament for, and critique of the destruction of the medieval city in the name of &quot;progress&quot;:

 &quot;Old&quot; Paris is gone (no human heart&lt;br&gt;
changes half so fast as a city&#x27;s face) ...&lt;br&gt;
There used to be a poultry market here,&lt;br&gt;
and one cold morning ... I saw&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;a swan that had broken out of its cage,&lt;br&gt;
webbed feet clumsy on the cobblestones,&lt;br&gt;
white feathers dragging through uneven ruts,&lt;br&gt;
and obstinately pecking at the drains ...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Paris changes ... but in sadness like mine&lt;br&gt;
nothing stirs—new buildings, old&lt;br&gt;
neighbourhoods turn to allegory,&lt;br&gt;
and memories weigh more than stone.

Haussmann was also criticized for the great cost of his project. Napoleon III deposed Haussmann on 5 January 1870 in order to improve his own flagging popularity. Haussmann was a favourite target of the Situationist&#x27;s critique. Besides pointing out the repressive aims that were achieved by Haussmann&#x27;s urbanism, Guy Debord and his friends, who considered urbanism to be a &quot;state science&quot; or inherently &quot;capitalist&quot; science, also underlined that he nicely separated leisure areas from work places, thus announcing modern functionalism, as illustrated by Le Corbusier&#x27;s precise zone tripartition, with one zone for circulation, one for housing, and one for labour.

Some of the contemporary critics of Haussmann softened their views over time. Jules Simon was an ardent republican who had refused to take an oath to Napoleon III, and had been a fierce critic of Haussmann in parliament but in 1882, he wrote of Haussmann in the &quot;Gaulois&quot;:

&quot;He tried to make Paris a magnificent city, and he succeeded completely. When he took Paris in hand and managed our affairs, rue Saint-Honore and rue Saint-Antoine were still the largest streets in the city. We had no other promenades than the Grands Boulevards and the Tuileries; the Champs-Élysées was most of the time a sewer; the Bois-de-Boulogne was at the end of the world. We were lacking water, markets, light, in those far-off times, which are only thirty years past. He demolished neighbourhoods- one could say, entire cities. They cried that he would create a plague; he let us cry and, on the contrary, through his intelligent piercing of streets, he gave us air, health and life. Here he created a street; there he created an avenue or a boulevard; here a Place, a Square; a Promenade. Out of emptiness he made the Champs-Élysées, the Bois de Boulogne, the Bois de Vincennes. He introduced, into his beautiful capital, trees and flowers, and populated it with statues.&quot;

===The debate about the military function of Haussmann&#x27;s boulevards===
Some critics and historians in the 20th century, notably Lewis Mumford, argued that the real purpose of Haussmann&#x27;s boulevards was to make it easier for the army to crush popular uprisings. According to these critics, the wide boulevards gave the army greater mobility, a wider range of fire for their cannon, and made it harder to block streets with barricades. They argued that the boulevards built by Haussmann allowed the French army to easily suppress the Paris Commune in 1871.

Other historians disputed this argument. They noted that while Haussmann sometimes mentioned the military advantages of the boulevards when seeking funding for his projects, it was never the main purpose. Their main purpose, according to Napoleon III and Haussmann, was to improve traffic circulation, provide space and light and views of the city landmarks, and to beautify Paris.

Haussmann did not deny the military value of the wider streets. In his &quot;Memoires&quot;, he wrote that his new boulevard Sebastopol resulted in the &quot;gutting of old Paris, of the quarter of riots and barricades.&quot; He admitted he sometimes used this argument with the parliament to justify the high cost of his projects, arguing that they were for national defense and should be paid for, at least partially, by the state. He wrote: &quot;But, as for me, I who was the promoter of these additions made to original project, I declare that I never thought in the least, in adding them, of their greater or lesser strategic value.&quot; 

The Paris urban historian Patrice de Moncan wrote: &quot;To see the works created by Haussmann and Napoleon III only from the perspective of their strategic value is very reductive. The Emperor was a convinced follower of Saint-Simon. His desire to make Paris, the economic capital of France, a more open, more healthy city, not only for the upper classes but also for the workers, cannot be denied, and should be recognised as the primary motivation.&quot;

During the suppression of the Paris Commune in 1871, the newly built-boulevards were not a major factor in the Commune&#x27;s defeat. The Communards were defeated in one week, not because of Haussmann&#x27;s boulevards, but because they were outnumbered by five to one. They had fewer weapons and fewer men trained to use them, they had no plan for the defense of the city. They had very few experienced officers and there was no single commander, with each neighborhood left to defend itself, and they had no hope of military support from outside of Paris.

<text>The Hunchback of Notre-Dame (, originally titled Notre-Dame de Paris. 1482) is a French Gothic novel by Victor Hugo, published in 1831. The title refers to the Notre-Dame Cathedral, which features prominently throughout the novel. It focuses on the unfortunate story of Quasimodo, the Roma street dancer Esmeralda and Quasimodo&#x27;s guardian the Archdeacon Claude Frollo in 15th-century Paris. All its elements—the Renaissance setting, impossible love affairs and marginalised characters—make the work a model of the literary themes of Romanticism.

The novel is considered a classic of French literature and has been adapted repeatedly for film, stage and television. Some prominent examples include a 1923 silent film with Lon Chaney, a 1939 sound film with Charles Laughton, a 1956 film with Anthony Quinn and a 1996 Disney animated film with Tom Hulce.

Written during a time of cultural upheaval, the novel champions historical preservation. Hugo solidified Notre-Dame de Paris as a national icon, arguing for the preservation of Gothic architecture as an element of France&#x27;s cultural heritage.

==Title==
The novel&#x27;s French title, &quot;Notre-Dame de Paris&quot;, refers to Notre-Dame Cathedral. Frederic Shoberl&#x27;s 1833 English translation was published as &quot;The Hunchback of Notre-Dame&quot;. This became the generally used title in English, referring to Quasimodo, Notre-Dame&#x27;s bell-ringer.

== Background ==

Victor Hugo initially agreed to write &quot;Notre-Dame de Paris&quot; in 1828. Due to Hugo&#x27;s other literary projects, the novel fell by the wayside until 1830. A primary theme of the novel is that of the value of Gothic architecture, which was neglected and often destroyed to be replaced by new buildings or defaced by replacement of parts of buildings in a newer style. For instance, the medieval stained glass panels of Notre-Dame de Paris had been replaced by white glass to let more light into the church. A few years earlier, Hugo had already published a paper entitled &quot;Guerre aux Démolisseurs&quot; (&quot;War [declared] on the Demolishers&quot;) specifically aimed at saving Paris&#x27;s medieval architecture. The agreement with his original publisher, Gosselin, was that the book would be finished that same year, but Hugo was constantly delayed due to the demands of other projects. In the summer of 1830, Gosselin demanded that Hugo complete the book by February 1831. Beginning in September 1830, Hugo worked nonstop on the project thereafter.

Legend has it that Hugo locked himself in his room, getting rid of his clothes to write the novel on time, the idea being he could not go outside without clothes.

==Plot==
In 1482 Paris, during the 21st year of the reign of Louis XI, 10 years before Christopher Columbus landed in the Americas, sixteen-year-old Roma dancer Esmeralda is the romantic and sexual interest of many men, including Captain Phoebus de Chateaupers; poet Pierre Gringoire; the deformed cathedral bell-ringer Quasimodo, and his guardian Archdeacon Claude Frollo. Frollo is torn between his obsessive lust for Esmeralda and the rules of Notre-Dame Cathedral. He orders Quasimodo to kidnap her, but Quasimodo is captured by Phoebus and his guards. After he saves her, Esmeralda becomes infatuated with Phoebus. Gringoire, who attempted to help Esmeralda but was knocked out by Quasimodo, unwittingly wanders into the &quot;Court of Miracles&quot;, populated by the Roma and the truands (beggars). They are about to hang him for being an outsider, but Esmeralda saves him by agreeing to marry him. She only does it to save his life, however, and much to Gringoire&#x27;s annoyance, refuses to allow him to touch her.

The following day, Quasimodo is sentenced to be flogged and turned on the pillory for two hours, followed by another hour&#x27;s public exposure. He calls for water. Seeing his thirst, Esmeralda approaches the public stocks and offers him a drink of water. It saves him, and she captures his heart.

Frollo learns from Gringoire, with whom he has a passing acquaintance, that Esmeralda has taught her pet goat, Djali, who sometimes performs with her on stage, to spell &quot;PHOEBUS&quot; using movable letters, and that she often whispers the name Phoebus when she thinks she is alone. Frollo suspects Phoebus may be a name. As it happens, Phoebus is a drinking companion of Frollo&#x27;s dissolute younger brother, Jehan. After seeing them set out for a local tavern, Frollo follows them. He learns that Phoebus has arranged an assignation with Esmeralda at a local boarding-house, and follows Phoebus there. He observes the meeting from an adjoining room. Esmeralda begs Phoebus to marry her, but Phoebus only wants to lie with her, and eventually seduces her. Inflamed with jealousy, Frollo stabs Phoebus, though not fatally. Esmeralda briefly faints, though not before she has caught a glimpse of Frollo. When she recovers, Frollo has fled, and she is found near Phoebus&#x27; body. Esmeralda is arrested and charged with the attempted murder of Phoebus and also with witchcraft, and is sentenced to death by hanging. The prison&#x27;s torturer hurts her so badly that she falsely confesses to Phoebus&#x27; murder. While imprisoned, awaiting her execution, Esmeralda is visited by Frollo. The Archdeacon professes his love for her and promises to help her escape if she reciprocates. However, recognising him as Phoebus&#x27; true attacker, she angrily rebuffs him. As Esmeralda is being led to the gallows, Quasimodo swings down from Notre-Dame and carries her off to the cathedral, temporarily protecting herunder the law of sanctuaryfrom arrest.

Frollo delves deeper into his obsession and gets frustrated with his plan failing. Upon seeing Esmeralda and Quasimodo when going to meet the latter, he grows jealous. That night he breaks into Esmeralda&#x27;s cell with his master-key and attempts to rape her. Quasimodo intervenes and beats him, almost throwing him off the cathedral before the moonlight reveals his identity. Frollo kicks Quasimodo and declares to Esmeralda that if he cannot have her, no one shall.

Frollo later informs Gringoire that the Court of Parlement has voted to remove Esmeralda&#x27;s right to sanctuary so she can no longer seek shelter in the cathedral and will be taken away to be executed. Clopin Trouillefou, the leader of the Roma, hears the news from Gringoire and rallies the Court of Miracles to charge Notre-Dame and rescue Esmeralda.

Quasimodo incorrectly assumes the approaching Roma intend to harm Esmeralda and drives them off. As Quasimodo defends the cathedral against the invaders, the uproar reaches the king, who is incorrectly informed that those attacking the cathedral are eager for Esmeralda&#x27;s hanging rather than trying to rescue her. The king orders the authorities to dispatch the invaders and calls for Esmeralda&#x27;s immediate execution to settle the unrest. In the chaos, Esmeralda is taken from the cathedral by Frollo and Gringoire.

The king&#x27;s men come to Notre-Dame searching for Esmeralda. Quasimodo believes they intend to rescue her and helps them, meaning that if she had still been there, he would have inadvertently betrayed her.

Frollo once again attempts to win Esmeralda&#x27;s love, but she asserts that she would rather die than be with him. Frollo goes to alert the authorities while trapping Esmeralda with Sister Gudule, a reclusive anchoress who bears an extreme hatred for the Roma, as she believes they cannibalised her infant daughter. However, it is revealed that Gudule is really Esmeralda&#x27;s birth mother and that Esmeralda is Gudule&#x27;s long-lost daughter Agnes, abducted and raised by the Roma. The two women&#x27;s joyous reunion is cut short when the king&#x27;s men arrive to take Esmeralda to the gallows. A desperate Gudule clings to Esmeralda even as she is taken to the place of execution. The guards pull the old woman off her daughter, and she falls to the pavement and dies from the harsh impact.

From the tower of Notre-Dame, Frollo and Quasimodo witness as Esmeralda is hanged. Upon observing this, Quasimodo pushes the Archdeacon from the height of the cathedral to his death. With nothing left to live for, Quasimodo vanishes and is never seen again.

A deformed skeleton is found many years later embracing another in the charnel house at Montfaucon, implying that Quasimodo had sought Esmeralda among the decaying corpses and laid down to die while holding her. As the guards attempt to pull the skeletons apart, his skeleton crumbles to dust.

==Characters==
===Major===
* Esmeralda (born Agnès) is the novel&#x27;s protagonist. She is a beautiful 16-year-old Roma street dancer (referred to in the text by &quot;Gypsy&quot;) who is naturally compassionate and kind. She is the center of the human drama within the story. A popular focus of the citizens&#x27; attention, she is the recipient of their changing attitudes, being first adored as an entertainer, then hated as a witch, before being lauded again by Quasimodo. She is loved by Quasimodo, Pierre Gringoire, and Claude Frollo but falls hopelessly in love with Captain Phoebus. Phoebus is a handsome soldier who she believes will protect her but in reality, simply wants to seduce her. She is one of the few characters to show Quasimodo a measure of human kindness. She is eventually revealed to be not Roma by birth; instead, she was kidnapped by the Roma to &quot;replace&quot; the deformed Quasimodo.
* Quasimodo is a &quot;hunchback&quot; with physical deformities, the novel&#x27;s titular character, and the bell-ringer of Notre-Dame. He is half-blind and almost completely deaf, the latter from all the years ringing the bells of the church. Abandoned by his mother as a baby, he was adopted by Claude Frollo. Quasimodo&#x27;s life within the confines of the cathedral and his only two outletsringing the bells and his love and devotion for Frolloare described. He rarely ventures outside the Cathedral because the citizens of Paris despise and shun him for his appearance. The notable occasions when he does leave include taking part in the Festival of Fools (which is celebrated on 6 January), during which he is elected the Pope of Fools due to his perfect hideousness; his subsequent attempt to kidnap Esmeralda; his rescue of Esmeralda from the gallows; his attempt to bring Phoebus to Esmeralda; and his final abandonment of the cathedral at the end of the novel. It is revealed in the story that the baby Quasimodo was left by the Roma in place of Esmeralda, whom they abducted.
* Claude Frollo, the novel&#x27;s main antagonist, is the Archdeacon of Notre-Dame. His sour attitude and alchemical experiments have alienated him from Parisians, who believe him to be a sorcerer. His only surviving relative is his dissolute younger brother Jehan, whom he unsuccessfully attempts to reform. Frollo also helps care for Quasimodo. Frollo&#x27;s numerous sins include lechery, failed alchemy, sexual assault and other listed vices. His mad attraction to Esmeralda sets off a chain of events leading to Esmeralda&#x27;s execution.
* Pierre Gringoire is a struggling poet. He mistakenly finds his way into the &quot;Court of Miracles&quot;, the domain of the Truands (beggars). In order to preserve the secret location of the Court, Gringoire must either be killed by hanging or marry a Roma. Although Esmeralda does not love him, and in fact believes him to be a coward, she takes pity on his plight and marries him. Touched by her beauty and kindness, Gringoire falls in love with her. But, because she is already in love with Phoebus, much to his disappointment, she will not let him touch her. As time goes on, he grows more fond of Esmeralda&#x27;s goat Djali than Esmeralda herself, so much so that he chooses to save Djali rather than Esmeralda when Frollo and his guards pursue and kidnap her.
* Captain Phoebus de Chateaupers is the Captain of the King&#x27;s Archers, and the secondary antagonist in the novel. After he saves Esmeralda from abduction, she becomes infatuated with him, and he is intrigued by her. Already betrothed to the beautiful but spiteful Fleur-de-Lys, he wants to seduce Esmeralda nonetheless but is prevented when Frollo stabs him. Phoebus survives, but Esmeralda is taken to be the attempted assassin by all, including Phoebus himself, who no longer wants her. He is condemned to an unhappy married life with Fleur-de-Lys.

===Minor===
* Clopin Trouillefou is the King of Truands. He sentences Gringoire to be hanged and presides over his &quot;wedding&quot; to Esmeralda. He rallies the Court of Miracles to rescue Esmeralda from Notre-Dame after the idea is suggested by Gringoire. He is eventually killed during the attack by the King&#x27;s soldiers.
* Mathias Hungadi Spicali, called &quot;Duke of Egypt and Bohemia&quot;, is Esmeralda&#x27;s protector and second-in-command of the Truands. He knows of her past and gave her an amulet to help find her mother. He is last seen during the riot at Notre-Dame to rescue Esmeralda.
* Jehan Frollo &quot;du Moulin&quot; (literally &quot;of the mill&quot;), translated in Latin as &quot;Joannes Frollo &quot;de Molendino&quot;, is Claude Frollo&#x27;s 16-year-old dissolute younger brother. He is a troublemaker and a student at the university. He is dependent on his brother for money, which he then proceeds to squander on alcohol. After Frollo stops giving him money, Jehan becomes a rogue. When he joins Clopin and his beggars to raid the cathedral, he briefly enters the cathedral by ascending one of the towers with a borrowed ladder. Afterwards he sees Quasimodo and tries to shoot an arrow at his eye, but Quasimodo throws him to his death.
* Fleur-de-Lys de Gondelaurier is a beautiful and wealthy noblewoman engaged to Phoebus. Phoebus&#x27;s attentions to Esmeralda make her insecure and jealous, and she and her friends respond by treating Esmeralda with contempt and spite. Fleur-de-Lys later neglects to inform Phoebus that Esmeralda has not been executed, which serves to deprive the pair of any further contactthough as Phoebus no longer lusts after Esmeralda by this time, this does not matter. The novel ends with their wedding, but they are said to be condemned to an unhappy marriage.
* Madame Aloïse de Gondelaurier is Fleur-de-Lys&#x27;s mother.
* Sister Gudule, also known as Sachette and formerly named Paquette Guybertaut &quot;la Chantefleurie&quot;&quot;, is an anchoress living in seclusion in an exposed cell in central Paris. She is tormented by the loss of her daughter Agnes, whom she believes to have been cannibalised by the Roma as a baby, and devotes her life to mourning her. Her long-lost daughter turns out to be Esmeralda, a fact she discovers only moments before Esmeralda is hanged. Gudule is accidentally killed by one of the King&#x27;s soldiers while attempting to prevent them from taking her daughter.
* Djali is Esmeralda&#x27;s pet goat. In addition to dancing with Esmeralda, Djali can do tricks for money, such as tell time, spell Phoebus&#x27;s name, and do impressions of public figures. Later, during Esmeralda&#x27;s trial, when Esmeralda is falsely accused of stabbing Phoebus, Djali is falsely accused of being the devil in disguise. At the end of the novel, Djali is saved by Gringoire (who has become fond of the goat during his marriage to Esmeralda) after Esmeralda is captured and hanged.
* Louis XI is the King of France. He appears as an old and sick man, but his personality is very sly and Machiavellian, as well as self-centred. He appears briefly when he is brought the news of the rioting at Notre-Dame. He orders his guard to kill the rioters, and also the &quot;witch&quot; Esmeralda, because of being misinformed about the reason of rioting.
* Tristan l&#x27;Hermite is a friend of King Louis XI. He leads the band that goes to capture Esmeralda.
* Henriet Cousin is the city executioner, who hangs Esmeralda.
* Florian Barbedienne is the judge who presides over Quasimodo&#x27;s case for kidnapping Esmeralda. Barbedienne is deaf, and does not realise Quasimodo is also deaf; thus, he assumes Quasimodo is mocking him by not answering his questions. Barbedienne sentences Quasimodo to be tortured in the public square: one hour of flogging for attempted kidnap, and another hour of public disgrace for (what Barbedienne assumed to be) mocking the judge.
* Jacques Charmolue is Claude Frollo&#x27;s friend in charge of torturing prisoners. He gets Esmeralda to falsely confess to killing Phoebus. He then has her imprisoned.
* Jacques Coppenole is a man who appears at the beginning of the novel as one of the Flemish guests at the Feast of Fools. He convinces the Parisians to walk out on Gringoire&#x27;s play and select the Fools&#x27; Pope.
* Pierrat Torterue makes two brief appearances in the novel. He is the torturer at the Châtelet. He tortures Esmeralda after her interrogation, hurting her so badly that she falsely confesses, sealing her own fate. He is also the official who administers the savage flogging that Quasimodo is sentenced to by Barbedienne.
* An unnamed magistrate presides over Esmeralda&#x27;s case after she is falsely accused of stabbing Phoebus. He forces her to confess to the crime and sentences her to be hanged on the gallows.
* Robin Poussepain is Jehan Frollo&#x27;s friend who appears with him during the Feast of Fools and Quasimodo&#x27;s flogging in the public square.
* Olivier le Mauvais (literally &quot;Olivier the Evil&quot;) is King Louis XI&#x27;s close advisor.
* La Falourdel owns the boarding-house where Phoebus and Esmeralda meet.
* Marc Cenaine is a magician whom Jacques Charmolue and Claude Frollo torture for practising witchcraft while they try to pry alchemy secrets from him.
* Bérangère de Champchevrier is Fleur-de-Lys&#x27;s friend.
* Jacques Coictier is King Louis XI&#x27;s physician.
* Robert d&#x27;Estouteville is the chamberlain to King Louis XI. He is in a foul mood the day Quasimodo is pilloried, not realising that Quasimodo and the judge on duty are both deaf.
* Colombe is Fleur-de-Lys&#x27;s friend.
* Lambert Hoctement is a German scholar who, at the beginning of the novel, is tormented by Jehan Frollo and Robin Poussepain.
* Bertrand, the majestic cathedral cat.

==Major themes==
The novel&#x27;s original French title, &quot;Notre-Dame de Paris&quot;, indicates that the cathedral itself is the most significant aspect of the novel, both the main setting and the focus of the story&#x27;s themes. The building had fallen into disrepair at the time of writing, which was something Hugo felt strongly about. The book portrays the Romantic era as one of extremes in architecture, passion, and religion. The theme of determinism (fate and destiny, as set up in the preface of the novel through the introduction of the word &quot;ANANKE&quot;) is explored, as well as revolution and social strife.

===Architecture===
Architecture is a major concern of Hugo&#x27;s in &quot;Notre-Dame de Paris&quot;, not just as embodied in the cathedral itself, but as representing throughout Paris and the rest of Europe an artistic genre which, Hugo argued, was about to disappear with the arrival of the printing press. Claude Frollo&#x27;s portentous phrase, &quot;&quot; (&quot;This will kill that&quot;, as he looks from a printed book to the cathedral building), sums up this thesis, which is expounded on in Book V, chapter 2. Hugo writes that &quot;&quot; (&quot;whoever was born a poet became an architect&quot;), arguing that while the written word was heavily censored and difficult to reproduce, architecture was extremely prominent and enjoyed considerable freedom.
With the recent introduction of the printing press, it became possible to reproduce one&#x27;s ideas much more easily on paper, and Hugo considered this period to represent the last flowering of architecture as a great art form. As with many of his books, Hugo was interested in a time that seemed to him to be on the cusp of two types of society.

The major theme of the third book is that over time the cathedral has been repaired but these repairs and additions have made the cathedral worse: &quot;And who put the cold, white panes in the place of those windows&quot; and &quot;...who substituted for the ancient Gothic altar, splendidly encumbered with shrines and reliquaries, that heavy marble sarcophagus, with angels&#x27; heads and clouds&quot; are a few examples of this. This chapter also discusses how, after repairs to the cathedral after the French Revolution, there was not a significant style in what was added. It seems as if the new architecture is now uglier and worse than it was before the repair.

==Literary significance and reception==
Hugo introduced with this work the concept of the novel as Epic Theatre. A giant epic about the history of a whole people, incarnated in the figure of the great cathedral as witness and silent protagonist of that history, and the whole idea of time and life as an ongoing, organic panorama centered on dozens of characters caught in the middle of that history. It is the first novel to have beggars as protagonists.

A significant aspect of &quot;Notre-Dame de Paris&quot; is that it encompasses the whole of life, from the King of France to Paris sewer rats, in a manner later used by Honoré de Balzac, Gustave Flaubert and many others, including Charles Dickens. The enormous popularity of the book in France spurred the nascent historical preservation movement in that country and strongly encouraged Gothic revival architecture. Ultimately it led to major renovations at Notre-Dame in the 19th century led by Eugène Viollet-le-Duc. Much of the cathedral&#x27;s present appearance is a result of this renovation.

==Allusions and references==

===Allusions to actual history, geography and current science===
In &quot;The Hunchback of Notre-Dame&quot;, Victor Hugo makes frequent reference to the architecture of the Cathedral of Notre-Dame in Paris. He also mentions the invention of the printing press, when the bookmaker near the beginning of the work speaks of &quot;the German pest&quot;.

In 2010, British archivist Adrian Glew discovered references to a real-life man called &quot;Hunchback&quot; who was a foreman of a government sculpting studio in Paris in the 1820s who worked on post-Revolution restorations to the cathedral.

===Allusions in other works===
The name Quasimodo has become synonymous with &quot;a courageous heart beneath a grotesque exterior&quot;.

==Adaptations==
To date, all the film and TV adaptations have strayed somewhat from the original plot, some going as far as to give it a happy ending, including in the classic 1939 film and the 1996 Disney animated film. The 1956 French film is one of the few versions to end almost exactly like the novel, although it changes other sections of the story. The 1996 Disney version has an ending that is inspired by an opera created by Hugo himself.

<text>The Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) is a simple lockstep communication protocol for transmitting or receiving files in a client-server application. A primary use of TFTP is in the early stages of nodes booting on a local area network when the operating system or firmware images are stored on a file server.

TFTP was first standardized in 1981 and updated in .

==Overview==
Due to its simple design, TFTP can be easily implemented by code with a small memory footprint. It is, therefore, the protocol of choice for the initial stages of any network booting strategy like BOOTP, PXE, BSDP, etc., when targeting from highly resourced computers to very low resourced Single-board computers (SBC) and System on a Chip (SoC). It is also used to transfer firmware images and configuration files to network appliances like routers, firewalls, IP phones, etc. Today, TFTP is virtually unused for Internet transfers.

TFTP&#x27;s design was influenced from the earlier protocol EFTP, which was part of the PARC Universal Packet protocol suite. TFTP was first defined in 1980 by IEN 133.
In June 1981 The TFTP Protocol (Revision 2) was published as RFC 783 and later updated in July 1992 by RFC 1350 which fixed among other things the Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice syndrome. In March 1995 the TFTP Option Extension RFC 1782 updated later in May 1998 by RFC 2347, defined the option negotiation mechanism which establishes the framework for file transfer options to be negotiated prior to the transfer using a mechanism that is consistent with TFTP&#x27;s original specification.

TFTP is a simple protocol for transferring files, implemented on top of the UDP/IP protocols using well-known port number 69. TFTP was designed to be small and easy to implement, and therefore it lacks most of the advanced features offered by more robust file transfer protocols. TFTP only reads and writes files from or to a remote server. It cannot list, delete, or rename files or directories and it has no provisions for user authentication.
Today TFTP is generally only used on local area networks (LAN).

==Operation==



A TFTP transfer is initiated by the client issuing a request to read or write a particular file on the server. The request can optionally include a set of negotiated transfer parameters proposed by the client under the terms specified by RFC 2347. If the server grants the request, the file is sent in fixed-length blocks of 512 bytes by default or the number specified in the blocksize negotiated option defined by RFC 2348. Each block of transferred data, which is usually carried within a single IP packet in order to avoid IP fragmentation, must be acknowledged before the next block can be sent. A data packet of less than 512 bytes or the agreed blocksize option signals the termination of a transfer. If a packet gets lost in the network, the intended recipient will timeout and may retransmit their last packet (which may be data or an acknowledgment), thus causing the sender of the lost packet to retransmit that lost packet. The sender has to keep just one packet on hand for retransmission since the lock step acknowledgment guarantees that all older packets have been correctly received. Notice that both devices involved in a transfer are considered senders and receivers. One sends data and receives acknowledgments, the other sends acknowledgments and receives data.

TFTP defines three modes of transfer: netascii, octet, and mail.
*Netascii is a modified form of ASCII, defined in RFC 764. It consists of an 8-bit extension of the 7-bit ASCII character space from 0x20 to 0x7F (the printable characters and the space) and eight of the control characters. The allowed control characters include the null (0x00), the line feed (LF, 0x0A), and the carriage return (CR, 0x0D). Netascii also requires that the end of line marker on a host be translated to the character pair CR LF for transmission and that any CR must be followed by either a LF or the null.
*Octet allows for the transfer of arbitrary raw 8-bit bytes, with the received file resulting byte-per-byte identical to the one sent. More correctly, if a host receives an octet file and then returns it, the returned file must be identical to the original.
*Mail transfer mode uses Netascii transfer, but the file is sent to an email recipient by specifying that recipient&#x27;s email address as the file name. RFC 1350 declared this mode of transfer obsolete.

TFTP uses the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) at the transport layer. A transfer request is always initiated targeting port 69, but the data transfer ports are chosen independently by the sender and receiver during the transfer initialization. The ports are chosen at random according to the parameters of the networking stack, typically from the range of ephemeral ports.

# The initiating host A sends an RRQ (read request) or WRQ (write request) packet to host S at port number 69, containing the filename, transfer mode, and optionally any negotiated option under the terms of RFC 2347.
# S replies with an option ACK if options were used, and an ACK (acknowledgment) packet to WRQ and directly with a DATA packet to RRQ. The packet is sent from a randomly allocated ephemeral port, and all future packets to host S should be directed to this port.
# The source host sends numbered DATA packets to the destination host, all but the last containing a full-sized block of data (512 bytes default). The destination host replies with numbered ACK packets for all DATA packets.
# The final DATA packet must contain less than a full-sized block of data to signal that it is the last. If the size of the transferred file is an exact multiple of the block size, the source sends a final DATA packet containing 0 bytes of data.
# Receiver responds to each DATA with associated numbered ACK. The sender responds to the first received ACK of a block with DATA of the next block.
# If an ACK is not eventually received, a retransmit timer re-sends DATA packet.

TFTP has typically been associated with network booting. One of the first applications was the Bootstrap Loading using TFTP standard RFC 906, published in 1984, which established the 1981 published Trivial File Transfer Protocol standard RFC 783 to be used as the standard file transfer protocol for bootstrap loading. It was followed shortly after by the Bootstrap Protocol standard RFC 951 (BOOTP), published in 1985, which allowed a disk-less client machine to discover its own IP address, the address of a TFTP server, and the name of a Network Bootstrap Program (NBP) to be TFTP transferred, loaded into memory, and executed. Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol standard RFC 2131 (DHCP) published in 1997 improved BOOTP capabilities. Finally, the Preboot Execution Environment (PXE) version 2.0 was released in December 1998, and the update 2.1 was made public in September 1999 counting on TFTP as its file transfer protocol. Intel has recently decided to widely support PXE within the new UEFI specification extending the TFTP support to all EFI/UEFI environments.

The original protocol has a transfer file size limit of 512 bytes/block x 65535 blocks = 32 MB. In 1998 this limit was extended to 65535 bytes/block x 65535 blocks = 4 GB by TFTP Blocksize Option RFC 2348. If the defined blocksize produces an IP packet size that exceeds the minimum MTU at any point of the network path, IP fragmentation and reassembly will occur not only adding more overhead but also leading to total transfer failure when the minimalist IP stack implementation in a host&#x27;s BOOTP or PXE ROM does not (or fails to properly) implement IP fragmentation and reassembly. If TFTP packets should be kept within the standard Ethernet MTU (1500), the blocksize value is calculated as 1500 minus headers of TFTP (4 bytes), UDP (8 bytes) and IP (20 bytes) = 1468 bytes/block, this gives a limit of 1468 bytes/block x 65535 blocks = 92 MB. Today most servers and clients support block number roll-over (block counter going back to 0 or 1 after 65535) which gives an essentially unlimited transfer file size.

Since TFTP utilizes UDP, it has to supply its own transport and session support. Each file transferred via TFTP constitutes an independent exchange. Classically, this transfer is performed in lock-step, with only one packet (either a block of data or an acknowledgment) alternatively in flight on the network at any time. Due to this single data block strategy instead of sending a larger amount of uninterrupted data blocks before pausing the transfer to wait for the corresponding acknowledge (windowing), TFTP provides low throughput especially over high latency links. Microsoft introduced windowed TFTP in Windows 2008 as part of their Windows Deployment Services (WDS), in January 2015 TFTP Windowsize Option RFC 7440 was published. This substantially improves performance for things like PXE booting without the IP fragmentation side effect sometimes observed on Blocksize Option RFC 2348

==Security considerations==

TFTP includes no login or access control mechanisms. Care must be taken when using TFTP for file transfers where authentication, access control, confidentiality, or integrity checking are needed. Note that those security services could be supplied above or below the layer at which TFTP runs. Care must also be taken in the rights granted to a TFTP server process so as not to violate the security of the server&#x27;s file system. TFTP is often installed with controls such that only files that have public read access are available via TFTP. Also listing, deleting, renaming, and writing files via TFTP are typically disallowed. TFTP file transfers are not recommended where the inherent protocol limitations could raise insurmountable liability concerns.

<doc id="52812" wikidata="Q180600" url="?curid=52812" title="Humidity">
<text>Humidity is the concentration of water vapor present in the air. Water vapor, the gaseous state of water, is generally invisible to the human eye. Humidity indicates the likelihood for precipitation, dew, or fog to be present.

Humidity depends on the temperature and pressure of the system of interest. The same amount of water vapor results in higher relative humidity in cool air than warm air. A related parameter is the dew point. The amount of water vapor needed to achieve saturation increases as the temperature increases. As the temperature of a parcel of air decreases it will eventually reach the saturation point without adding or losing water mass. The amount of water vapor contained within a parcel of air can vary significantly. For example, a parcel of air near saturation may contain 8 g of water per cubic metre of air at , and 28 g of water per cubic metre of air at 

Three primary measurements of humidity are widely employed: absolute, relative, and specific. Absolute humidity is expressed as either mass of water vapor per volume of moist air (in grams per cubic meter) or as mass of water vapor per mass of dry air (usually in grams per kilogram). Relative humidity, often expressed as a percentage, indicates a present state of absolute humidity relative to a maximum humidity given the same temperature. Specific humidity is the ratio of water vapor mass to total moist air parcel mass.

Humidity plays an important role for surface life. For animal life dependent on perspiration (sweating) to regulate internal body temperature, high humidity impairs heat exchange efficiency by reducing the rate of moisture evaporation from skin surfaces. This effect can be calculated using a heat index table, or alternatively using a similar humidex.

The notion of air &quot;holding&quot; water vapor or being &quot;saturated&quot; by it is often mentioned in connection with the concept of relative humidity. This, however, is misleading—the amount of water vapor that enters (or can enter) a given space at a given temperature is almost independent of the amount of air (nitrogen, oxygen, etc.) that is present. Indeed, a vacuum has approximately the same equilibrium capacity to hold water vapor as the same volume filled with air; both are given by the equilibrium vapor pressure of water at the given temperature. There is a very small difference described under &quot;Enhancement factor&quot; below, which can be neglected in many calculations unless great accuracy is required.

== Definitions ==
=== Absolute humidity ===

Absolute humidity is the total mass of water vapor (gas form of water) present in a given volume or mass of air. It does not take temperature into consideration. Absolute humidity in the atmosphere ranges from near zero to roughly per cubic metre when the air is saturated at .

Air is a gas, and its volume varies with pressure and temperature, per Boyle&#x27;s law. &quot;Absolute humidity&quot; is defined as water mass per volume of air. A given mass of air will grow or shrink as the temperature or pressure varies. So the absolute humidity of a mass of air will vary due to changes in temperature or pressure, even when the proportion of water in that mass of air (its &quot;specific humidity&quot;) remains constant. This makes the term &quot;absolute humidity&quot; as defined not ideal for some situations. 

Absolute humidity is the mass of the water vapor formula_1, divided by the volume of the air and water vapor mixture formula_2, which can be expressed as:
formula_3 In the equation above, if the volume is not set, the absolute humidity varies with changes in air temperature or pressure. Because of this variability, use of the term &quot;absolute humidity&quot; as defined is inappropriate for computations in chemical engineering, such as drying, where temperature variations might be significant. As a result, absolute humidity in chemical engineering may refer to mass of water vapor per unit mass of dry air, also known as the &quot;humidity ratio&quot; or &quot;mass mixing ratio&quot; (see &quot;specific humidity&quot; below), which is better suited for heat and mass balance calculations. Mass of water per unit volume as in the equation above is also defined as &quot;volumetric humidity&quot;. Because of the potential confusion, British Standard BS 1339 suggests avoiding the term &quot;absolute humidity&quot;. Units should always be carefully checked. Many humidity charts are given in g/kg or kg/kg, but any mass units may be used.

=== Relative humidity ===
Relative humidity is the ratio of &quot;how much water vapour is in the air&quot; to &quot;how much water vapour the air could potentially contain&quot; at a given temperature. It varies with the temperature of the air: colder air can contain less vapour, and water will tend to condense out of the air more at lower temperatures. So changing the temperature of air can change the relative humidity, even when the specific humidity remains constant.

Chilling air increases the relative humidity. If the relative humidity rises over 100% (the dew point) and there is an available surface or particle, the water vapour will condense into liquid or ice. Likewise, warming air decreases the relative humidity. Warming some air containing a fog may cause that fog to evaporate, as the droplets are prone to total evaporation due to the lowering partial pressure of water vapour in that air, as the temperature rises.

Relative humidity only considers the invisible water vapour. Mists, clouds, fogs and aerosols of water do not count towards the measure of relative humidity of the air, although their presence is an indication that a body of air may be close to the dew point.

Relative humidity is normally expressed as a percentage; a higher percentage means that the air–water mixture is more humid. At 100% relative humidity, the air is saturated and is at its dew point. In the absence of a foreign body on which droplets or crystals can nucleate, the relative humidity can exceed 100%, in which case the air is said to be supersaturated. Introduction of some particles or a surface to a body of air above 100% relative humidity will allow condensation or ice to form on those nuclei, thereby removing some of the vapour and lowering the humidity.

In a scientific notion, the relative humidity (formula_4 or formula_5) of an air-water mixture is defined as the ratio of the partial pressure of water vapor (formula_6) in air to the saturation vapor pressure (formula_7) of water at the same temperature, usually expressed as a percentage:
formula_8

Relative humidity is an important metric used in weather forecasts and reports, as it is an indicator of the likelihood of precipitation, dew, or fog. In hot summer weather, a rise in relative humidity increases the apparent temperature to humans (and other animals) by hindering the evaporation of perspiration from the skin. For example, according to the &quot;heat index&quot;, a relative humidity of 75% at air temperature of would feel like .

Because wood expands/contracts with high/low humidity, relative humidity is a key metric used to evaluate moisture content and hence size changes in wood, such as making predictions/allowances for seasonal movement in wood floors.

=== Specific humidity ===

&quot;Specific humidity&quot; (or moisture content) is the ratio of the mass of water vapor to the total mass of the air parcel. Specific humidity is approximately equal to the mixing ratio, which is defined as the ratio of the mass of water vapor in an air parcel to the mass of &quot;dry&quot; air for the same parcel. It is typically represented with the symbol ω, and is commonly used in HVAC system design.

=== Related concepts ===
The term &quot;relative humidity&quot; is reserved for systems of water vapor in air. The term &quot;relative saturation&quot; is used to describe the analogous property for systems consisting of a condensable phase other than water in a non-condensable phase other than air.

== Measurement ==

A device used to measure humidity of air is called a psychrometer or hygrometer. A humidistat is a humidity-triggered switch, often used to control a humidifier or a dehumidifier.

The humidity of an air and water vapor mixture is determined through the use of psychrometric charts if both the dry bulb temperature (&quot;T&quot;) and the wet bulb temperature (&quot;T&quot;w) of the mixture are known. These quantities are readily estimated by using a sling psychrometer.

There are several empirical formulas that can be used to estimate the equilibrium vapor pressure of water vapor as a function of temperature. The Antoine equation is among the least complex of these, having only three parameters (&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, and &quot;C&quot;). Other formulas, such as the Goff–Gratch equation and the Magnus–Tetens approximation, are more complicated but yield better accuracy.

The Arden Buck equation is commonly encountered in the literature regarding this topic:
formula_9
where formula_10 is the dry-bulb temperature expressed in degrees Celsius (°C), formula_11 is the absolute pressure expressed in millibars, and formula_12 is the equilibrium vapor pressure expressed in millibars. Buck has reported that the maximal relative error is less than 0.20% between when this particular form of the generalized formula is used to estimate the equilibrium vapor pressure of water.

There are various devices used to measure and regulate humidity. Calibration standards for the most accurate measurement include the gravimetric hygrometer, chilled mirror hygrometer, and electrolytic hygrometer. The gravimetric method, while the most accurate, is very cumbersome. For fast and very accurate measurement the chilled mirror method is effective. For process on-line measurements, the most commonly used sensors nowadays are based on capacitance measurements to measure relative humidity, frequently with internal conversions to display absolute humidity as well. These are cheap, simple, generally accurate and relatively robust. All humidity sensors face problems in measuring dust-laden gas, such as exhaust streams from clothes dryers.

Humidity is also measured on a global scale using remotely placed satellites. These satellites are able to detect the concentration of water in the troposphere at altitudes between . Satellites that can measure water vapor have sensors that are sensitive to infrared radiation. Water vapor specifically absorbs and re-radiates radiation in this spectral band. Satellite water vapor imagery plays an important role in monitoring climate conditions (like the formation of thunderstorms) and in the development of weather forecasts.

== Air density and volume ==
Humidity depends on water vaporization and condensation, which, in turn, mainly depends on temperature. Therefore, when applying more pressure to a gas saturated with water, all components will initially decrease in volume approximately according to the &quot;ideal gas law&quot;. However, some of the water will condense until returning to almost the same humidity as before, giving the resulting total volume deviating from what the ideal gas law predicted. 

Conversely, decreasing temperature would also make some water condense, again making the final volume deviate from predicted by the ideal gas law. Therefore, gas volume may alternatively be expressed as the dry volume, excluding the humidity content. This fraction more accurately follows the ideal gas law. On the contrary the saturated volume is the volume a gas mixture would have if humidity was added to it until saturation (or 100% relative humidity).

Humid air is less dense than dry air because a molecule of water () is less massive than either a molecule of nitrogen () or a molecule of oxygen (). About 78% of the molecules in dry air are nitrogen (N2). Another 21% of the molecules in dry air are oxygen (O2). The final 1% of dry air is a mixture of other gases.

For any gas, at a given temperature and pressure, the number of molecules present in a particular volume is constant. Therefore, when some number N of water molecules (vapor) is introduced into a volume of dry air, the number of air molecules in that volume must decrease by the same number N for the pressure to remain constant without using a change in temperature. The numbers are exactly equal if we consider the gases as ideal. The addition of water molecules, or any other molecules, to a gas, without removal of an equal number of other molecules, will necessarily require a change in temperature, pressure, or total volume; that is, a change in &quot;at least&quot; one of these three parameters. 

If temperature and pressure remain constant, the volume increases, and the dry air molecules that were displaced will initially move out into the additional volume, after which the mixture will eventually become uniform through diffusion. Hence the mass per unit volume of the gas—its density—decreases. Isaac Newton discovered this phenomenon and wrote about it in his book &quot;Opticks&quot;.

== Pressure dependence ==
The relative humidity of an air–water system is dependent not only on the temperature but also on the absolute pressure of the system of interest. This dependence is demonstrated by considering the air–water system shown below. The system is closed (i.e., no matter enters or leaves the system).

If the system at State A is isobarically heated (heating with no change in system pressure), then the relative humidity of the system decreases because the equilibrium vapor pressure of water increases with increasing temperature. This is shown in State B.

If the system at State A is isothermally compressed (compressed with no change in system temperature), then the relative humidity of the system increases because the partial pressure of water in the system increases with the volume reduction. This is shown in State C. Above 202.64 kPa, the RH would exceed 100% and water may begin to condense.

If the pressure of State A was changed by simply adding more dry air, without changing the volume, the relative humidity would not change.

Therefore, a change in relative humidity can be explained by a change in system temperature, a change in the volume of the system, or change in both of these system properties.

=== Enhancement factor ===
The enhancement factor formula_13 is defined as the ratio of the saturated vapor pressure of water in moist air formula_14 to the saturated vapor pressure of pure water:
formula_15

The enhancement factor is equal to unity for ideal gas systems. However, in real systems the interaction effects between gas molecules result in a small increase of the equilibrium vapor pressure of water in air relative to equilibrium vapor pressure of pure water vapor. Therefore, the enhancement factor is normally slightly greater than unity for real systems.

The enhancement factor is commonly used to correct the equilibrium vapor pressure of water vapor when empirical relationships, such as those developed by Wexler, Goff, and Gratch, are used to estimate the properties of psychrometric systems.

Buck has reported that, at sea level, the vapor pressure of water in saturated moist air amounts to an increase of approximately 0.5% over the equilibrium vapor pressure of pure water.

== Effects ==
Climate control refers to the control of temperature and relative humidity in buildings, vehicles and other enclosed spaces for the purpose of providing for human comfort, health and safety, and of meeting environmental requirements of machines, sensitive materials (for example, historic) and technical processes.

=== Climate ===
While humidity itself is a climate variable, it also affects other climate variables. Environmental humidity is affected by winds and by rainfall.

The most humid cities on Earth are generally located closer to the equator, near coastal regions. Cities in parts of Asia and Oceania are among the most humid. Bangkok, Ho Chi Minh City, Kuala Lumpur, Hong Kong, Manila, Jakarta, Naha, Singapore, Kaohsiung and Taipei have very high humidity most or all year round because of their proximity to water bodies and the equator and often overcast weather. 

Some places experience extreme humidity during their rainy seasons combined with warmth giving the feel of a lukewarm sauna, such as Kolkata, Chennai and Kochi in India, and Lahore in Pakistan. Sukkur city located on the Indus River in Pakistan has some of the highest and most uncomfortable dew points in the country, frequently exceeding in the monsoon season.

High temperatures combine with the high dew point to create heat index in excess of . Darwin experiences an extremely humid wet season from December to April. Houston, Miami, San Diego, Osaka, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Tokyo also have an extreme humid period in their summer months. During the South-west and North-east Monsoon seasons (respectively, late May to September and November to March), expect heavy rains and a relatively high humidity post-rainfall. 

Outside the monsoon seasons, humidity is high (in comparison to countries further from the Equator), but completely sunny days abound. In cooler places such as Northern Tasmania, Australia, high humidity is experienced all year due to the ocean between mainland Australia and Tasmania. In the summer the hot dry air is absorbed by this ocean and the temperature rarely climbs above .

=== Global climate ===

Humidity affects the energy budget and thereby influences temperatures in two major ways. First, water vapor in the atmosphere contains &quot;latent&quot; energy. During transpiration or evaporation, this latent heat is removed from surface liquid, cooling the Earth&#x27;s surface. This is the biggest non-radiative cooling effect at the surface. It compensates for roughly 70% of the average net radiative warming at the surface.

Second, water vapor is the most abundant of all greenhouse gases. Water vapor, like a green lens that allows green light to pass through it but absorbs red light, is a &quot;selective absorber&quot;. Like the other greenhouse gasses, water vapor is transparent to most solar energy. However, it absorbs the infrared energy emitted (radiated) upward by the Earth&#x27;s surface, which is the reason that humid areas experience very little nocturnal cooling but dry desert regions cool considerably at night. This selective absorption causes the greenhouse effect. It raises the surface temperature substantially above its theoretical radiative equilibrium temperature with the sun, and water vapor is the cause of more of this warming than any other greenhouse gas.

Unlike most other greenhouse gases, however, water is not merely below its boiling point in all regions of the Earth, but below its freezing point at many altitudes. As a condensible greenhouse gas, it precipitates, with a much lower scale height and shorter atmospheric lifetime — weeks instead of decades. Without other greenhouse gases, Earth&#x27;s blackbody temperature, below the freezing point of water, would cause water vapor to be removed from the atmosphere. Water vapor is thus a &quot;slave&quot; to the non-condensible greenhouse gases.

=== Animal and plant life ===

Humidity is one of the fundamental abiotic factors that defines any habitat (the tundra, wetlands, and the desert are a few examples), and is a determinant of which animals and plants can thrive in a given environment.

The human body dissipates heat through perspiration and its evaporation. Heat convection, to the surrounding air, and thermal radiation are the primary modes of heat transport from the body. Under conditions of high humidity, the rate of evaporation of sweat from the skin decreases. Also, if the atmosphere is as warm or warmer than the skin during times of high humidity, blood brought to the body surface cannot dissipate heat by conduction to the air. With so much blood going to the external surface of the body, less goes to the active muscles, the brain, and other internal organs. Physical strength declines, and fatigue occurs sooner than it would otherwise. Alertness and mental capacity also may be affected, resulting in &quot;heat stroke&quot; or hyperthermia.

Domesticated plants and animals (e.g. lizards) require regular upkeep of humidity percent when grown in-home and container conditions, for optimal thriving environment.

=== Human comfort ===
Although humidity is an important factor for thermal comfort, humans are more sensitive to variations in temperature than they are to changes in relative humidity. Humidity has a small effect on thermal comfort outdoors when air temperatures are low, a slightly more pronounced effect at moderate air temperatures, and a much stronger influence at higher air temperatures.

Humans are sensitive to humid air because the human body uses evaporative cooling as the primary mechanism to regulate temperature. Under humid conditions, the &quot;rate&quot; at which perspiration evaporates on the skin is lower than it would be under arid conditions. Because humans perceive the rate of heat transfer from the body rather than temperature itself, we feel warmer when the relative humidity is high than when it is low.

Humans can be comfortable within a wide range of humidities depending on the temperature—from 30 to 70%—but ideally not above the Absolute (60 °F Dew Point), between 40% and 60%. In general, higher temperatures will require lower humidities to achieve thermal comfort compared to lower temperatures, with all other factors held constant. For example, with clothing level = 1, metabolic rate = 1.1, and air speed 0.1 m/s, a change in air temperature and mean radiant temperature from 20 °C to 24 °C would lower the maximum acceptable relative humidity from 100% to 65% to maintain thermal comfort conditions. The CBE Thermal Comfort Tool can be used to demonstrate the effect of relative humidity for specific thermal comfort conditions and it can be used to demonstrate compliance with ASHRAE Standard 55–2017.

Some people experience difficulty breathing in humid environments. Some cases may possibly be related to respiratory conditions such as asthma, while others may be the product of anxiety. Affected people will often hyperventilate in response, causing sensations of numbness, faintness, and loss of concentration, among others.

Very low humidity can create discomfort, respiratory problems, and aggravate allergies in some individuals. Low humidity causes tissue lining nasal passages to dry, crack and become more susceptible to penetration of rhinovirus cold viruses. Extremely low (below 20%) relative humidities may also cause eye irritation. The use of a humidifier in homes, especially bedrooms, can help with these symptoms. Indoor relative humidities kept above 30% reduce the likelihood of the occupant&#x27;s nasal passages drying out, especially in winter.

Air conditioning reduces discomfort by reducing not just temperature but humidity as well. Heating cold outdoor air can decrease relative humidity levels indoors to below 30%. According to ASHRAE Standard 55-2017: Thermal Environmental Conditions for Human Occupancy, indoor thermal comfort can be achieved through the PMV method with relative humidities ranging from 0% to 100%, depending on the levels of the other factors contributing to thermal comfort. However, the recommended range of indoor relative humidity in air conditioned buildings is generally 30–60%.

=== Human health ===
Higher humidity reduces the infectivity of aerosolized influenza virus. A study concluded, &quot;Maintaining indoor relative humidity &gt;40% will significantly reduce the infectivity of aerosolized virus.&quot;

Excess moisture in buildings expose occupants to fungal spores, cell fragments, or mycotoxins. Infants in homes with mold have a much greater risk of developing asthma and allergic rhinitis. More than half of adult workers in moldy/humid buildings develop nasal or sinus symptoms due to mold exposure.

Mucociliary clearance in the respiratory tract is also hindered by low humidity. One study in dogs found that mucus transport was lower at an absolute humidity of 9 g/m3 than at 30 g/m3.

Increased humidity can also lead to changes in total body water that usually leads to moderate weight gain, especially if one is acclimated to working or exercising in hot and humid weather.

=== Building construction ===

Common construction methods often produce building enclosures with a poor thermal boundary, requiring an insulation and air barrier system designed to retain indoor environmental conditions while resisting external environmental conditions. The energy-efficient, heavily sealed architecture introduced in the 20th century also sealed off the movement of moisture, and this has resulted in a secondary problem of condensation forming in and around walls, which encourages the development of mold and mildew. Additionally, buildings with foundations not properly sealed will allow water to flow through the walls due to capillary action of pores found in masonry products. Solutions for energy-efficient buildings that avoid condensation are a current topic of architecture.

For climate control in buildings using HVAC systems, the key is to maintain the relative humidity at a comfortable range—low enough to be comfortable but high enough to avoid problems associated with very dry air.

When the temperature is high and the relative humidity is low, evaporation of water is rapid; soil dries, wet clothes hung on a line or rack dry quickly, and perspiration readily evaporates from the skin. Wooden furniture can shrink, causing the paint that covers these surfaces to fracture.

When the temperature is low and the relative humidity is high, evaporation of water is slow. When relative humidity approaches 100%, condensation can occur on surfaces, leading to problems with mold, corrosion, decay, and other moisture-related deterioration. Condensation can pose a safety risk as it can promote the growth of mold and wood rot as well as possibly freezing emergency exits shut.

Certain production and technical processes and treatments in factories, laboratories, hospitals, and other facilities require specific relative humidity levels to be maintained using humidifiers, dehumidifiers and associated control systems.

=== Vehicles ===
The basic principles for buildings, above, also apply to vehicles. In addition, there may be safety considerations. For instance, high humidity inside a vehicle can lead to problems of condensation, such as misting of windshields and shorting of electrical components. In vehicles and pressure vessels such as pressurized airliners, submersibles and spacecraft, these considerations may be critical to safety, and complex environmental control systems including equipment to maintain pressure are needed.

=== Aviation ===
Airliners operate with low internal relative humidity, often under 20%, especially on long flights. The low humidity is a consequence of drawing in the very cold air with a low absolute humidity, which is found at airliner cruising altitudes. Subsequent warming of this air lowers its relative humidity. This causes discomfort such as sore eyes, dry skin, and drying out of mucosa, but humidifiers are not employed to raise it to comfortable mid-range levels because the volume of water required to be carried on board can be a significant weight penalty. As airliners descend from colder altitudes into warmer air, perhaps even flying through clouds a few thousand feet above the ground, the ambient relative humidity can increase dramatically. 

Some of this moist air is usually drawn into the pressurized aircraft cabin and into other non-pressurized areas of the aircraft and condenses on the cold aircraft skin. Liquid water can usually be seen running along the aircraft skin, both on the inside and outside of the cabin. Because of the drastic changes in relative humidity inside the vehicle, components must be qualified to operate in those environments. The recommended environmental qualifications for most commercial aircraft components is listed in RTCA DO-160.

Cold, humid air can promote the formation of ice, which is a danger to aircraft as it affects the wing profile and increases weight. Naturally aspirated internal combustion engines have a further danger of ice forming inside the carburetor. Aviation weather reports (METARs) therefore include an indication of relative humidity, usually in the form of the dew point.

Pilots must take humidity into account when calculating takeoff distances, because high humidity requires longer runways and will decrease climb performance.

Density altitude is the altitude relative to the standard atmosphere conditions (International Standard Atmosphere) at which the air density would be equal to the indicated air density at the place of observation, or, in other words, the height when measured in terms of the density of the air rather than the distance from the ground. &quot;Density Altitude&quot; is the pressure altitude adjusted for non-standard temperature.

An increase in temperature, and, to a much lesser degree, humidity, will cause an increase in density altitude. Thus, in hot and humid conditions, the density altitude at a particular location may be significantly higher than the true altitude.

=== Electronics ===
Electronic devices are often rated to operate only under certain humidity conditions (e.g., 10% to 90%). The optimal humidity for electronic devices is 30% to 65%. At the top end of the range, moisture may increase the conductivity of permeable insulators leading to malfunction. Too low humidity may make materials brittle. A particular danger to electronic items, regardless of the stated operating humidity range, is condensation. When an electronic item is moved from a cold place (e.g., garage, car, shed, air conditioned space in the tropics) to a warm humid place (house, outside tropics), condensation may coat circuit boards and other insulators, leading to short circuit inside the equipment. Such short circuits may cause substantial permanent damage if the equipment is powered on before the condensation has evaporated. A similar condensation effect can often be observed when a person wearing glasses comes in from the cold (i.e. the glasses become foggy). 

It is advisable to allow electronic equipment to acclimatise for several hours, after being brought in from the cold, before powering on. Some electronic devices can detect such a change and indicate, when plugged in and usually with a small droplet symbol, that they cannot be used until the risk from condensation has passed. In situations where time is critical, increasing air flow through the device&#x27;s internals, such as removing the side panel from a PC case and directing a fan to blow into the case, will reduce significantly the time needed to acclimatise to the new environment.

In contrast, a very low humidity level favors the build-up of static electricity, which may result in spontaneous shutdown of computers when discharges occur. Apart from spurious erratic function, electrostatic discharges can cause dielectric breakdown in solid-state devices, resulting in irreversible damage. Data centers often monitor relative humidity levels for these reasons.

=== Industry ===
High humidity can often have a negative effect on the capacity of chemical plants and refineries that use furnaces as part of a certain processes (e.g., steam reforming, wet sulfuric acid processes). For example, because humidity reduces ambient oxygen concentrations (dry air is typically 20.9% oxygen, but at 100% relative humidity the air is 20.4% oxygen), flue gas fans must intake air at a higher rate than would otherwise be required to maintain the same firing rate.

=== Baking ===
High humidity in the oven, represented by an elevated wet-bulb temperature, increases the thermal conductivity of the air around the baked item, leading to a quicker baking process or even burning. Conversely, low humidity slows the baking process down.

== Other important facts ==

At 100% relative humidity, air is saturated and at its dew point: the water vapor pressure would permit neither evaporation of nearby liquid water nor condensation to grow the nearby water; neither sublimation of nearby ice nor deposition to grow the nearby ice.

Relative humidity can exceed 100%, in which case the air is supersaturated. Cloud formation requires supersaturated air. Cloud condensation nuclei lower the level of supersaturation required to form fogs and clouds – in the absence of nuclei around which droplets or ice can form, a higher level of supersaturation is required for these droplets or ice crystals to form spontaneously. In the Wilson cloud chamber, which is used in nuclear physics experiments, a state of supersaturation is created within the chamber, and moving subatomic particles act as condensation nuclei so trails of fog show the paths of those particles.

For a given dew point and its corresponding absolute humidity, the relative humidity will change inversely, albeit nonlinearly, with the temperature. This is because the vapor pressure of water increases with temperature—the operative principle behind everything from hair dryers to dehumidifiers.

Due to the increasing potential for a higher water vapor partial pressure at higher air temperatures, the water content of air at sea level can get as high as 3% by mass at compared to no more than about 0.5% by mass at . This explains the low levels (in the absence of measures to add moisture) of humidity in heated structures during winter, resulting in dry skin, itchy eyes, and persistence of static electric charges. Even with saturation (100% relative humidity) outdoors, heating of infiltrated outside air that comes indoors raises its moisture capacity, which lowers relative humidity and increases evaporation rates from moist surfaces indoors, including human bodies and household plants.

Similarly, during summer in humid climates a great deal of liquid water condenses from air cooled in air conditioners. Warmer air is cooled below its dew point, and the excess water vapor condenses. This phenomenon is the same as that which causes water droplets to form on the outside of a cup containing an ice-cold drink.

A useful rule of thumb is that the maximum absolute humidity doubles for every increase in temperature. Thus, the relative humidity will drop by a factor of 2 for each increase in temperature, assuming conservation of absolute moisture. For example, in the range of normal temperatures, air at and 50% relative humidity will become saturated if cooled to , its dew point, and air at 80% relative humidity warmed to will have a relative humidity of only 29% and feel dry. By comparison, thermal comfort standard ASHRAE 55 requires systems designed to control humidity to maintain a dew point of though no lower humidity limit is established.

Water vapor is a lighter gas than other gaseous components of air at the same temperature, so humid air will tend to rise by natural convection. This is a mechanism behind thunderstorms and other weather phenomena. Relative humidity is often mentioned in weather forecasts and reports, as it is an indicator of the likelihood of dew, or fog. In hot summer weather, it also increases the apparent temperature to humans (and other animals) by hindering the evaporation of perspiration from the skin as the relative humidity rises. This effect is calculated as the heat index or humidex.

A device used to measure humidity is called a hygrometer; one used to regulate it is called a humidistat, or sometimes hygrostat. These are analogous to a thermometer and thermostat for temperature, respectively.

The field concerned with the study of physical and thermodynamic properties of gas–vapor mixtures is named psychrometrics.

<text>Dialectic (; ), also known as the dialectical method, refers originally to dialogue between people holding different points of view about a subject but wishing to arrive at the truth through reasoned argument. Dialectic resembles debate, but the concept excludes subjective elements such as emotional appeal and rhetoric. It has its origins in ancient philosophy and continued to be developed in the Middle Ages.

Hegelianism refigured &quot;dialectic&quot; to no longer refer to a literal dialogue. Instead, the term takes on the specialized meaning of development by way of overcoming internal contradictions. Dialectical materialism, a theory advanced by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, adapted the Hegelian dialectic into a materialist theory of history. The legacy of Hegelian and Marxian dialectics has been criticized by philosophers, such as Karl Popper and Mario Bunge, who considered it unscientific.

Dialectic implies a developmental process and so does not fit naturally within classical logic. Nevertheless, some twentieth-century logicians have attempted to formalize it.

== Classical philosophy ==
In classical philosophy, dialectic ( ) is a form of reasoning based upon dialogue of arguments and counter-arguments, advocating &quot;propositions&quot; (theses) and &quot;counter-propositions&quot; (antitheses). The outcome of such a dialectic might be the refutation of a relevant proposition, or a synthesis, a combination of the opposing assertions, or a qualitative improvement of the dialogue.

The term &quot;dialectic&quot; owes much of its prestige to its role in the philosophies of Socrates and Plato, during the fifth and fourth centuries BC. Aristotle said that it was the pre-Socratic philosopher Zeno of Elea who invented dialectic, of which the dialogues of Plato are examples of the Socratic dialectical method.

=== Socratic method ===
The Socratic dialogues are a particular form of dialectic known as the method of &quot;elenchus&quot; (literally &#x27;refutation&#x27; or &#x27;scrutiny&#x27;) whereby a series of questions clarifies a more precise statement of a vague belief, logical consequences of that statement are explored, and a contradiction is discovered. The method is largely destructive, in that false belief is exposed and only constructive in that this exposure may lead to further search for truth. The detection of error does not amount to a proof of the antithesis. For example, a contradiction in the consequences of a definition of &quot;piety&quot; does not provide a correct definition. The principal aim of Socratic activity may be to improve the soul of the interlocutors, by freeing them from unrecognized errors, or indeed, by teaching them the spirit of inquiry.

In common cases, Socrates uses enthymemes as the foundation of his argument. For example, in the &quot;Euthyphro&quot;, Socrates asks Euthyphro to provide a definition of piety. Euthyphro replies that the pious is that which is loved by the gods. But, Socrates also has Euthyphro agreeing that the gods are quarrelsome and their quarrels, like human quarrels, concern objects of love or hatred. Therefore, Socrates reasons, at least one thing exists that certain gods love but other gods hate. Again, Euthyphro agrees. Socrates concludes that if Euthyphro&#x27;s definition of piety is acceptable, then there must exist at least one thing that is both pious and impious (as it is both loved and hated by the gods)—which Euthyphro admits is absurd. Thus, Euthyphro is brought to a realization by this dialectical method that his definition of piety is not sufficiently meaningful.

In another example, in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Gorgias&quot;, dialectic occurs between Socrates, the Sophist Gorgias, and two men, Polus and Callicles. Because Socrates&#x27; ultimate goal was to reach true knowledge, he was even willing to change his own views in order to arrive at the truth. The fundamental goal of dialectic, in this instance, was to establish a precise definition of the subject (in this case, rhetoric) and with the use of argumentation and questioning, make the subject even more precise. In the &quot;Gorgias&quot;, Socrates reaches the truth by asking a series of questions and in return, receiving short, clear answers.

=== Platonism ===
In Platonism and Neoplatonism, dialectic assumed an ontological and metaphysical role in that it became the process whereby the intellect passes from sensibles to intelligibles, rising from idea to idea until it finally grasps the supreme idea, the first principle which is the origin of all. The philosopher is consequently a &quot;dialectician&quot;. In this sense, dialectic is a process of inquiry that does away with hypotheses up to the first principle. It slowly embraces multiplicity in unity. The philosopher Simon Blackburn wrote that the dialectic in this sense is used to understand &quot;the total process of enlightenment, whereby the philosopher is educated so as to achieve knowledge of the supreme good, the Form of the Good&quot;.

=== Aristotle ===
Aristotle has been traditionally understood as viewing dialectic as a lesser method of reasoning than &quot;demonstration&quot;, which derives a necessarily true conclusion from premises assumed to be true via syllogism. Within the &quot;Organon&quot;, the series comprising Aristotle&#x27;s works about logic, the &quot;Topics&quot; is dedicated to dialectic—which he characterizes as argument from &quot;endoxa&quot; (&quot;generally accredited opinions&quot;) where positions are subject to lines of questioning, to which concessions may be made in response. While Aristotle asserts &quot;dialectic does not prove anything&quot;, he considers it to be a useful art closely related to rhetoric.

== Medieval philosophy ==

Logic, which could be considered to include dialectic, was one of the three liberal arts taught in medieval universities as part of the trivium; the other elements were rhetoric and grammar.

Based mainly on Aristotle, the first medieval philosopher to work on dialectics was Boethius (480–524). After him, many scholastic philosophers also made use of dialectics in their works, such as Peter Abelard, William of Sherwood, Garlandus Compotista, Walter Burley, Roger Swyneshed, William of Ockham, and Thomas Aquinas.

This dialectic (a ) was formed as follows:
# The question to be determined (&quot;It is asked whether...&quot;);
# A provisory answer to the question (&quot;And it seems that...&quot;);
# The principal arguments in favor of the provisory answer;
# An argument against the provisory answer, traditionally a single argument from authority (&quot;On the contrary...&quot;);
# The determination of the question after weighing the evidence (&quot;I answer that...&quot;);
# The replies to each of the initial objections. (&quot;To the first, to the second etc., I answer that...&quot;)

== Modern philosophy ==
The concept of dialectics was given new life at the start of the nineteenth century by Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, whose dialectical model of nature and of history made dialectics a fundamental aspect of reality, instead of regarding the contradictions into which dialectics leads as evidence of the limits of pure reason, as Immanuel Kant had argued. Hegel was influenced by Johann Gottlieb Fichte&#x27;s conception of synthesis, although Hegel didn&#x27;t adopt Fichte&#x27;s thesis–antithesis–synthesis language except to describe Kant&#x27;s philosophy: rather, Hegel argued that such language was &quot;a lifeless schema&quot; imposed on various contents, whereas he saw his own dialectic as flowing out of &quot;the inner life and self-movement&quot; of the content itself.

In the mid-nineteenth century, Hegelian dialectic was appropriated by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels and retooled in what they considered to be a nonidealistic manner. It would also become a crucial part of later representations of Marxism as a philosophy of dialectical materialism. These representations often contrasted dramatically and led to vigorous debate among different Marxist groups.

=== Hegelian dialectic ===


The Hegelian dialectic describes changes in the forms of thought through their own internal contradictions into concrete forms that overcome previous oppositions.

This dialectic is sometimes presented in a threefold manner, as first stated by Heinrich Moritz Chalybäus, as comprising three dialectical stages of development: a &quot;thesis&quot;, giving rise to its reaction; an &quot;antithesis&quot;, which contradicts or negates the thesis; and the tension between the two being resolved by means of a &quot;synthesis&quot;. Although, Hegel opposed these terms.

By contrast, the terms &quot;abstract&quot;, &quot;negative&quot;, and &quot;concrete&quot; suggest a flaw or an incompleteness in any initial thesis. For Hegel, the concrete must always pass through the phase of the negative, that is, mediation. This is the essence of what is popularly called Hegelian dialectics.

To describe the activity of overcoming the negative, Hegel often used the term &quot;Aufheben&quot;, variously translated into English as &#x27;sublation&#x27; or &#x27;overcoming&#x27;, to conceive of the working of the dialectic. Roughly, the term indicates preserving the true portion of an idea, thing, society, and so forth, while moving beyond its limitations. What is sublated, on the one hand, is overcome, but, on the other hand, is preserved and maintained.

As in the Socratic dialectic, Hegel claimed to proceed by making implicit contradictions explicit: each stage of the process is the product of contradictions inherent or implicit in the preceding stage. In his view, the purpose of dialectics is &quot;to study things in their own being and movement and thus to demonstrate the finitude of the partial categories of understanding&quot;.

For Hegel, even history can be reconstructed as a unified dialectic, the major stages of which chart a progression from self-alienation as servitude to self-unification and realization as the rational constitutional state of free and equal citizens.

=== Marxist dialectic ===
Marxist dialectic is a form of Hegelian dialectic which applies to the study of historical materialism. Marxist dialectic is thus a method by which one can examine social and economic behaviors. It is the foundation of the philosophy of dialectical materialism, which forms the basis of historical materialism.

In the Marxist tradition, &quot;dialectic&quot; refers to regular and mutual relationships, interactions, and processes in nature, society, and human thought.

A dialectical relationship is a relationship in which two phenomena or ideas mutually impact each other, leading to development and negation. Development refers to the change and motion of phenomena and ideas from less advanced to more advanced or from less complete to more complete. Dialectical negation refers to a stage of development in which a contradiction between two previous subjects gives rise to a new subject. In the Marxist view, dialectical negation is never an endpoint, but instead creates new conditions for further development and negation.

Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, writing several decades after Hegel&#x27;s death, proposed that Hegel&#x27;s dialectic is too abstract. Against this, Marx presented his own dialectic method, which he claimed to be &quot;direct opposite&quot; of Hegel&#x27;s method.

Marxist dialectics is exemplified in &quot;Das Kapital&quot;. As Marx explained,
Class struggle is the primary contradiction to be resolved by Marxist dialectics because of its central role in the social and political lives of a society. Nonetheless, Marx and Marxists developed the concept of class struggle to comprehend the dialectical contradictions between mental and manual labor and between town and country. Hence, philosophic contradiction is central to the development of dialectics: the progress from quantity to quality, the acceleration of gradual social change; the negation of the initial development of the status quo; the negation of that negation; and the high-level recurrence of features of the original status quo.

Friedrich Engels further proposed that nature itself is dialectical, and that this is &quot;a very simple process, which is taking place everywhere and every day&quot;. His dialectical &quot;law of the transformation of quantity into quality and vice versa&quot; corresponds, according to Christian Fuchs, to the concept of phase transition and anticipated the concept of emergence &quot;a hundred years ahead of his time&quot;.

For Vladimir Lenin, the primary feature of Marx&#x27;s &quot;dialectical materialism&quot; (Lenin&#x27;s term) is its application of materialist philosophy to history and social sciences. Lenin&#x27;s main contribution to the philosophy of dialectical materialism is his theory of reflection, which presents human consciousness as a dynamic reflection of the objective material world that fully shapes its contents and structure.

Later, Stalin&#x27;s works on the subject established a rigid and formalistic division of Marxist–Leninist theory into dialectical materialism and historical materialism. While the first was supposed to be the key method and theory of the philosophy of nature, the second was the Soviet version of the philosophy of history.

Soviet systems theory pioneer Alexander Bogdanov viewed Hegelian and materialist dialectic as progressive, albeit inexact and diffuse, attempts at achieving what he called tektology, or a universal science of organization.

=== Dialectical naturalism ===
Dialectical naturalism is a term coined by American philosopher Murray Bookchin to describe the philosophical underpinnings of the political program of social ecology. Dialectical naturalism explores the complex interrelationship between social problems, and the direct consequences they have on the ecological impact of human society. Bookchin offered dialectical naturalism as a contrast to what he saw as the &quot;empyrean, basically antinaturalistic dialectical idealism&quot; of Hegel, and &quot;the wooden, often scientistic dialectical materialism of orthodox Marxists&quot;.

== Theological dialectics ==
Neo-orthodoxy, in Europe also known as theology of crisis and dialectical theology, is a theological approach in Protestantism that was developed in the aftermath of the First World War (1914–1918). It is characterized as a reaction against doctrines of nineteenth-century liberal theology and a more positive reevaluation of the teachings of the Reformation, much of which had been in decline (especially in western Europe) since the late eighteenth century. It is primarily associated with two Swiss professors and pastors, Karl Barth (1886–1968) and Emil Brunner (1899–1966), even though Barth himself expressed his unease in the use of the term.

In dialectical theology, the difference and opposition between God and human beings is stressed in such a way that all human attempts at overcoming this opposition through moral, religious or philosophical idealism must be characterized as sin. In the death of Christ humanity is negated and overcome, but this judgment also points forwards to the resurrection in which humanity is reestablished in Christ. For Barth this meant that only through God&#x27;s &quot;no&quot; to everything human can his &quot;yes&quot; be perceived. Applied to traditional themes of Protestant theology, such as double predestination, this means that election and reprobation cannot be viewed as a quantitative limitation of God&#x27;s action. Rather it must be seen as its &quot;qualitative definition&quot;.

Dialectic prominently figured in Bernard Lonergan&#x27;s philosophy, in his books &quot;Insight&quot; and &quot;Method in Theology&quot;. Michael Shute wrote about Lonergan&#x27;s use of dialectic in &quot;The Origins of Lonergan&#x27;s Notion of the Dialectic of History&quot;. For Lonergan, dialectic is both individual and operative in community. Simply described, it is a dynamic process that results in something new:
Dialectic is one of the eight functional specialties Lonergan envisaged for theology to bring this discipline into the modern world. Lonergan believed that the lack of an agreed method among scholars had inhibited substantive agreement from being reached and progress from being made compared to the natural sciences. Karl Rahner, S. J., however, criticized Lonergan&#x27;s theological method in a short article entitled &quot;Some Critical Thoughts on &#x27;Functional Specialties in Theology&#x27;&quot; where he stated: &quot;Lonergan&#x27;s theological methodology seems to me to be &#x27;so generic that it really fits every science&#x27;, and hence is not the methodology of theology as such, but only a very general methodology of science.&quot;

== Criticisms ==

Friedrich Nietzsche viewed dialectic as a method that imposes artificial boundaries and suppresses the richness and diversity of reality. He rejected the notion that truth can be fully grasped through dialectical reasoning and offered a critique of dialectic, challenging its traditional framework and emphasizing the limitations of its approach to understanding reality. He expressed skepticism towards its methodology and implications in &quot;Twilight of the Idols&quot;: &quot;I mistrust all systematizers and I avoid them. The will to a system is a lack of integrity&quot;. In the same book, Nietzsche criticized Socrates&#x27; dialectics because he believed it prioritized reason over instinct, resulting in the suppression of individual passions and the imposition of an artificial morality.

Karl Popper attacked the dialectic repeatedly. In 1937, he wrote and delivered a paper entitled &quot;What Is Dialectic?&quot; in which he criticized the dialectics of Hegel, Marx, and Engels for their willingness &quot;to put up with contradictions&quot;. He argued that accepting contradiction as a valid form of logic would lead to the principle of explosion and thus trivialism. Popper concluded the essay with these words: &quot;The whole development of dialectic should be a warning against the dangers inherent in philosophical system-building. It should remind us that philosophy should not be made a basis for any sort of scientific system and that philosophers should be much more modest in their claims. One task which they can fulfill quite usefully is the study of the critical methods of science.&quot; Seventy years later, Nicholas Rescher responded that &quot;Popper&#x27;s critique touches only a hyperbolic version of dialectic&quot;, and he quipped: &quot;Ironically, there is something decidedly dialectical about Popper&#x27;s critique of dialectics.&quot; Around the same time as Popper&#x27;s critique was published, philosopher Sidney Hook discussed the &quot;sense and nonsense in dialectic&quot; and rejected two conceptions of dialectic as unscientific but accepted one conception as a &quot;convenient organizing category&quot;.

The philosopher of science and physicist Mario Bunge repeatedly criticized Hegelian and Marxian dialectics, calling them &quot;fuzzy and remote from science&quot; and a &quot;disastrous legacy&quot;. He concluded: &quot;The so-called laws of dialectics, such as formulated by Engels (1940, 1954) and Lenin (1947, 1981), are false insofar as they are intelligible.&quot; Poe Yu-ze Wan, reviewing Bunge&#x27;s criticisms of dialectics, found Bunge&#x27;s arguments to be important and sensible, but he thought that dialectics could still serve some heuristic purposes for scientists. Wan pointed out that scientists such as the American Marxist biologists Richard Levins and Richard Lewontin (authors of &quot;The Dialectical Biologist&quot;) and the German-American evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr, not a Marxist himself, have found agreement between dialectical principles and their own scientific outlooks, although Wan opined that Engels&#x27;s &quot;laws&quot; of dialectics &quot;in fact &#x27;explain&#x27; nothing&quot;.

Even some Marxists are critical of the term &quot;dialectics&quot;. For instance, Michael Heinrich wrote, &quot;More often than not, the grandiose rhetoric about dialectics is reducible to the simple fact that everything is dependent upon everything else and is in a state of interaction and that it&#x27;s all rather complicated—which is true in most cases, but doesn&#x27;t really say anything.&quot;

== Formalization ==

=== Defeasibility ===

=== Dialog games ===

=== Mathematics ===
Mathematician William Lawvere interpreted dialectics in the setting of categorical logic in terms of adjunctions between idempotent monads. This perspective may be useful in the context of theoretical computer science where the duality between syntax and semantics can be interpreted as a dialectic in this sense. For example, the Curry–Howard correspondence is such an adjunction or more generally the duality between closed monoidal categories and their internal logic.

<text>Sierra Entertainment, Inc. (formerly On-Line Systems and Sierra On-Line, Inc.) was an American video game developer and publisher founded in 1979 by Ken and Roberta Williams. The company is known for pioneering the graphic adventure game genre, including the first such game, &quot;Mystery House&quot;. It is known for its graphical adventure game series &quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot;, &quot;Space Quest&quot;, &quot;Police Quest&quot;, &quot;Gabriel Knight&quot;, &quot;Leisure Suit Larry&quot;, and &quot;Quest for Glory&quot;, and as the original publisher of Valve&#x27;s &quot;Half-Life&quot; series.

After seventeen years as an independent company, Sierra was acquired by CUC International in February 1996 to become part of CUC Software. However, CUC International was caught in an accounting scandal in 1998, and many of the original founders of Sierra including the Williamses left the company. Sierra remained as part of CUC Software as it was sold and renamed several times over the next few years. Sierra was formally disestablished as a company and reformed as a division of this group in August 2004. The former CUC Software group was acquired by Vivendi and branded as Vivendi Games in 2006. The Sierra division continued to operate through Vivendi Games&#x27;s merger with Activision to form Activision Blizzard on July 10, 2008, but was shut down later that year. The Sierra brand was revived by Activision in 2014 to re-release former Sierra games and some independently developed games.

Currently, the Sierra brand is under Microsoft&#x27;s ownership through its gaming division, following the acquisition of Activision Blizzard.

== History ==
=== Founding as On-Line Systems (1979–1982) ===
Sierra Entertainment was founded in 1979 as On-Line Systems in Simi Valley, California, by the husband-and-wife duo Ken and Roberta Williams. Ken, a programmer for IBM, had planned to use the company to create business software for the TRS-80 and Apple II. Ken had brought a teletype terminal home one day in 1979 and, while looking through the host system&#x27;s software catalog, discovered the text adventure &quot;Colossal Cave Adventure&quot;. He encouraged Roberta to join him in playing it, and she was enthralled by the game. After Ken had brought an Apple II to their home, she played through other text adventures such as those by Scott Adams and Softape to study them. Dissatisfied with the text-only format, she realized that the graphics display capability of the Apple II could enhance the adventure gaming experience. With Ken&#x27;s help in some of the programming, Roberta designed &quot;Mystery House&quot;, inspired by the novel &quot;And Then There Were None&quot; and the board game &quot;Clue&quot;, using text commands and printout combined with rudimentary graphics depicting the current setting.
&quot;Mystery House&quot; was released through mail-order in May 1980. It was an instant hit with about 15,000 copies sold, earning . It is the first computer adventure game to have graphics, although made with crude, static, monochrome, line drawings. The two shifted the focus to developing more graphical adventure games. &quot;Mystery House&quot; became the first in the &quot;Hi-Res Adventure&quot; series. The &quot;Hi-Res Adventure&quot; series continued with &quot;Mission Asteroid&quot;, which was released as &quot;Hi-Res Adventure #0&quot; though being the second release. The next release, &quot;Wizard and the Princess&quot;, also known as &quot;Adventure in Serenia&quot;, is considered a prelude to the later &quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot; series in both story and concept. Through 1981 and 1982, more games were released in the series including &quot;Cranston Manor&quot;, &quot;Ulysses and the Golden Fleece&quot;, &quot;Time Zone&quot;, and &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot;. A simplified version of &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot;, intended for a younger audience, was written by Al Lowe and released as &quot;Gelfling Adventure&quot;.

=== Rebranding to Sierra On-Line (1982–1988) ===
On-Line Systems was renamed Sierra On-Line in 1982, and moved to Oakhurst, California. The &quot;Sierra&quot; name was taken from the Sierra Nevada mountain range that Oakhurst was near, and its new logo incorporated the imagery of Half Dome mountain. By early 1984, &quot;InfoWorld&quot; estimated that Sierra was the world&#x27;s 12th-largest microcomputer software company, with in 1983 sales. It produced some non-game software, such as an Applesoft BASIC compiler.

The company weathered the video game crash of 1983 with only a 20% increase in sales, after analysts in 1982 had predicted a doubling in 1983 of the entire software market. The company had spent much of 1983 developing for the VIC-20 and the TI-99/4A which were both obsolete by the end of the year. Ken Williams was reportedly described as &quot;bewildered by the pace at which computers come into and fall out of favor&quot;, and Williams said, &quot;I&#x27;ve learned my lesson. I&#x27;m not moving until I understand the market better.&quot;

Many of Sierra&#x27;s best known series began in the 1980s. In 1983, Sierra On-Line was contacted by IBM to create a game for the new PCjr. IBM offered to fund the entire development and marketing of the game, paying royalties. Ken and Roberta Williams accepted and started on the project. Roberta Williams created a story featuring classic fairy-tale elements. Her game concept includes animated color graphics, a pseudo 3D-perspective where the main character is visible on the screen, a more competent text parser that understands advanced commands from the player, and music playing in the background through the PCjr sound hardware. For the game, a complete development system called Adventure Game Interpreter (AGI) was developed. In mid-1984, &quot;King&#x27;s Quest: Quest for the Crown&quot; was released to much acclaim, beginning the &quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot; series.

While finishing &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot;, programmers Mark Crowe and Scott Murphy began to plan for an adventure game of their own. After a simple demonstration to Ken Williams, he allowed them to start working on the full game, which was named &quot;Space Quest: The Sarien Encounter&quot;. The game was released in October 1986 as an instant success, spawning many sequels in the &quot;Space Quest&quot; series in the following years.

Al Lowe, who had been working at Sierra On-Line for many years, was asked by Ken Williams to write a modern version of Chuck Benton&#x27;s &quot;Softporn Adventure&quot; from 1981, the only pure text adventure that the company had ever released. &quot;Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards&quot; was a great hit and won the Software Publishers Association&#x27;s Best Adventure Game award of 1987. It can be deduced that the game first became famous as an early example of software piracy, as Sierra sold many more hintbooks than actual copies of the game. A series of &quot;Leisure Suit Larry&quot; games followed.

Ken Williams befriended a retired highway patrol officer named Jim Walls and asked him to produce an adventure series based on a police theme. Walls proceeded to create &quot;Police Quest: In Pursuit of the Death Angel&quot;, which was released in 1987. Several sequels followed, and the series was touted for adherence to police protocol (relevant parts of which were explained in the games&#x27; manuals), and presenting some real-life situations encountered by Walls during his career as an officer.

&quot;Quest for Glory&quot; is a series of hybrid adventure/role-playing video games designed by Corey and Lori Ann Cole. The first game in the series, &quot;Quest for Glory: So You Want to Be a Hero&quot;, was released in 1989. The series combines humor, puzzle elements, themes and characters borrowed from various legends, puns, and memorable characters, creating a five-part series of the Sierra stable. Although the series was originally titled &quot;Hero&#x27;s Quest&quot;, Sierra failed to trademark the name. Milton Bradley successfully trademarked an electronic version of their unrelated joint Games Workshop board game, &quot;HeroQuest,&quot; which forced Sierra to change the series&#x27; title to &quot;Quest for Glory&quot;. This decision caused all future games in the series, newer releases of &quot;Hero&#x27;s Quest I&quot;, to switch to the new name.

In 1987, Sierra On-Line started to publish its own gaming magazine, about its upcoming games and interviews with the developers. The magazine was initially named &quot;The Sierra Newsletter&quot;, &quot;The Sierra News Magazine&quot;, and &quot;The Sierra/Dynamix Newsmagazine&quot;. However, since Sierra Club already published a magazine called &quot;Sierra Magazine&quot;, the name of the magazine published by Sierra On-Line was changed to &quot;InterAction&quot; in 1991. It was discontinued in 1999.

Sierra&#x27;s Adventure Game Interpreter engine, introduced with &quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot;, was replaced in 1988 with Sierra&#x27;s Creative Interpreter in &quot;King&#x27;s Quest IV&quot;. The game was released under both engines, so those who had newer computers could use the new engine and better rendering technology.

=== Going public (1989–1995) ===
Sierra became a public company in 1989, trading on the NASDAQ under the stock ticker &quot;SIER&quot;. Additional public investment allowed the company to engage in further acquisitions over the next several years.

In 1990, Sierra released &quot;King&#x27;s Quest V&quot;, the first Sierra On-Line game ever to have more than 500,000 copies sold and the highest selling game for five years. It won several awards, such as the Best Adventure Game of the Year from both the Software Publishers Association and &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; magazine.

The Sierra Network was launched on May 6, 1991, as the first game-only online environment. Development of the network began in 1989, as Ken Williams was inspired by the launch of the Prodigy service in 1988 to create something similar for Sierra&#x27;s games. As a free service other than access use charges, the network provided a &quot;land-based&quot; precursor to MMORPGs and internet chat rooms, each land theme for the type of content provided multi-player gaming and category based bulletin boards and chat rooms throughout the continental United States. By July 1993, having reached about 40,000 subscribers, AT&amp;T announced a plan to invest into the network and add more games, gaining partial control as part of its expansion into the growing online services. AT&amp;T later took sole possession of the network on November 15, 1994, so the name was changed to the ImagiNation Network. The network failed to find a mass audience, and was sold to America On-Line in 1996.

In 1991, Sierra released the first game in the &quot;Dr. Brain&quot; series, &quot;Castle of Dr. Brain&quot;, a hybrid puzzle adventure education game, which has several sequels. In 1993, &quot;Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers&quot; was released, beginning the &quot;Gabriel Knight&quot; series. The game and subsequent sequels were critically acclaimed in the mainstream press at the time.

Sierra and Broderbund started merger discussions in March 1991, but the idea was discontinued later that month.
Sierra needed a new building due to growth, and moved its headquarters and much of its key staff to Bellevue, Washington. Sierra&#x27;s original location in Oakhurst was later renamed Yosemite Entertainment, and continued under that name until closing in early 1999.

The company was now made up of five separate and largely autonomous development divisions: Sierra Publishing, Sierra Northwest, Dynamix, Bright Star Technology, and Coktel Vision, with each group working separately on product development but sharing manufacturing, distribution, and sales resources.

1995 was a successful year for the company. Sierra was the market-share leader in PC games for the year. With $83.4 million in sales from software-publishing, earnings improved by 19 percent, and a net income of $11.9 million. In June, Sierra and Pioneer Electric Corp. signed an agreement to create a joint venture that would develop, publish, manufacture, and market entertainment software for the Japanese software market. This joint venture created a new company called Sierra Venture. With Sierra and Pioneer investing over $12 million, the new company immediately manufactured and shipped over twenty of Sierra&#x27;s most popular products to Japan and created new titles for the Japanese market. 1995 also saw Sierra acquiring a number of development companies, both small home developers and larger companies.

&quot;Phantasmagoria&quot; was by far the largest project ever undertaken by Sierra. The anticipation for the game was high at release in late 1995. Although nearly one million copies were sold when the game was first released in August 1995, Sierra&#x27;s bestselling adventure game created, the game received mixed reviews from industry critics.

=== Sale to CUC International (1996–1998) ===
In February 1996, early e-commerce pioneer CUC International, seeking to expand into interactive entertainment, offered to buy Sierra at a price of about . Walter Forbes, the CEO of CUC International, and a member of Sierra&#x27;s own Board of Directors since 1991, surprised Ken Williams with the deal after a board meeting. At this time, Sierra had modest revenues of about in the current fiscal year, so the sum surprised Ken. Forbes had posited the idea to Ken that this would be the start of a large company eventually to bring in LucasArts Entertainment, Broderbund, and Davidson &amp; Associates (which at the time owned Blizzard Entertainment) under one entity and be a major publisher in the video game industry, as a great boon to the Williams and to Sierra&#x27;s shareholders. Roberta had expressed her concerns about the offer to Ken and to executive officers, but he remained interested in the potential that Forbes offered. Ken accepted the offer, believing it was in the best interest for Sierra&#x27;s future and stockholders, and CUC announced by the end of February 1996 the beginning of closing the acquisition of both Sierra and Davidson for and in CUC stock, respectively. The deal to obtain LucasArts and Broderbund failed.

Sierra&#x27;s acquisition closed on July 24, 1996. The terms included naming Ken Williams a vice-chairman of CUC International, a Member of the Office of the President of CUC, and that he would remain responsible for Sierra&#x27;s R&amp;D and remain Sierra&#x27;s CEO. He also requested creation of a &quot;software board&quot; consisting of him, Michael Brochu (Sierra&#x27;s President and COO), Bob Davidson (founder and CEO of Davidson &amp; Associates), and Forbes. It functioned as a governing body of what would become CUC Software, regulating major decisions and product lines.

In September 1996, CUC announced consolidation of some functions of its game companies into a single company called CUC Software Inc., headquartered in Torrance, California. Bob Davidson, founder and CEO of Davidson &amp; Associates became the CEO for the publishing body. CUC Software consolidated manufacturing, distribution, and sales resources of all of divisions including what was to become Sierra, Davidson, Blizzard, Knowledge Adventure, and Gryphon Software.

CUC Software utilized its various labels&#x27; market specialties. For example, in October 1996, Sierra published &quot;Stay Tooned!&quot;, an adventure game developed by Funnybone Interactive (a subsidiary of Davidson &amp; Associates) as Sierra was more known as an adventure game publisher than Davidson.

In November 1996, Ken Williams met with the founders of Valve and negotiated Sierra&#x27;s exclusive rights to publish &quot;Half-Life&quot;, which Ken Williams debuted at E3 in May 1997. In December 1996, Sierra released &quot;The Realm Online&quot;, an online fantasy role-playing game.

After the sale, Ken Williams remained within the software division so that he could provide strategic guidance to Sierra, although he began to grow disillusioned as he soon found that his new titles at CUC meant very little and the software board met only once. He began disputes with Davidson over Davidson&#x27;s conservative management style and his disdain for Sierra&#x27;s more risque product lines such as &quot;Phantasmagoria&quot; and &quot;Leisure Suit Larry&quot;.

In January 1997, Davidson stepped down as CEO of CUC Software, and CUC Executive Chris MacLeod was named as his replacement. After this, Ken Williams shifted his focus work on CUC&#x27;s online product distributor, NetMarket while remaining as CEO of Sierra in name only. In November, Ken Williams departed from CUC International, while Roberta Williams remained with Sierra until the release of &quot;King&#x27;s Quest: Mask of Eternity&quot; in December 1998. Brochu, who had been hired in 1995 by Ken Williams, to handle the daily business affairs of Sierra, replaced Ken Williams and remained as President of Sierra until October 1997, when he too departed the company.

In April 1997, to further expand upon their role in the edutainment business, Sierra purchased Books That Work and CUC International purchased Berkeley Systems and transferred management of the studio to Sierra as an internal developer. In December 1997, in order to secure the rights to &quot;Return to Krondor&quot;, Sierra purchased PyroTechnix, who were developing the game.

On November 5, 1997, after the departure of Brochu in October, Sierra was split into three business units, all of which reported directly to MacLeod.

In 1998, Sierra divided into 5 sub-brands and corporate divisions:
* Sierra Attractions (for casual games such as poker) - composed of Berkeley Systems
* Sierra Home (for home/lifestyle software) - composed of Sierra&#x27;s gardening, home design, and cooking software divisions
* Sierra Sports (For sports games) - composed of Dynamix&#x27;s Sports Titles, Synergistic Software, and Papyrus
* Sierra Studios (general publishing division) - Composed of Sierra Northwest/Bellevue, Pyrotechnix, and Impressions Software
* Sierra FX (adventure games and online multiplayer games) - Based at Sierra&#x27;s old headquarters in Oakhurst, which was publicly referred to as Yosemite Entertainment.

On November 24, 1997, Sierra published &quot;&quot;, the official expansion pack for the widely popular game &quot;Diablo&quot; developed by Synergistic Software, a division of Sierra.

On November 19, 1998, Sierra published &quot;Half-Life&quot; for the PC, developed by Valve, which became a huge success.

During these events, CUC merged with Henry Silverman&#x27;s HFS Incorporated in December 1997 and became the Cendant Corporation. The merger did not immediately affect operations of Sierra. However, Silverman, who served as CEO of Cendant, had become more involved with the bookkeeping of the merged companies and noticed irregularities from CUC&#x27;s past bookkeeping, leading to the discovery of massive accounting fraud at CUC in March 1998. Forbes was later convicted on three charges related to fraud by the Security and Exchange Commission in 2007. With the news, Cendant announced intention to sell the computer entertainment division, and on November 20, 1998, announced the sale of the consumer software division to Paris-based Havas S.A. Sierra became a part of Havas Interactive, the interactive entertainment division of the company.

=== Fallout from CUC&#x27;s acquisition (1999–2003) ===
On February 22, 1999, Sierra announced a major reorganization of the company, resulting in the shutdown of several of their development studios, cutbacks on others and the relocation of key projects, and employees from those studios, to Bellevue. About 250 people in total lost their jobs. Development groups within Sierra such as PyroTechnix were shut down. Others such as Books That Work were relocated to Bellevue. Also shut down was Yosemite Entertainment, the division occupying the original headquarters of Sierra On-Line. The company sold the rights of Headgate Studios back to the original owner. With the exception of the warehouse and distribution department, the entire studio was shut down. Game designers Al Lowe and Scott Murphy were laid off. Lowe had just started work on &quot;Leisure Suit Larry 8&quot;. Murphy was involved in a &quot;Space Quest 7&quot; project at the time. Layoffs continued on March 1, when Sierra terminated 30 employees at the previously unaffected Dynamix, or 15 percent of their workforce.

Despite the layoffs, Sierra continued to publish games for smaller development houses. In September 1999, they released &quot;Homeworld&quot;, a real-time space-combat strategy game developed by Relic Entertainment. The game design was revolutionary for the genre, and the game received great critical acclaim and many awards.

UK-based game developer and publisher Codemasters, in an effort to establish themselves in the United States, announced the launch of a new development studio in Oakhurst, using the abandoned Sierra facilities and hiring much of the Yosemite Entertainment&#x27;s laid-off staff in mid-September 1999. In early October, the company announced plans to take over management and maintenance of the online RPG &quot;The Realm&quot; and acquiring the complete yet previously canceled &quot;Navy SEALs&quot;. The company also reported they obtained the rights to continue using the name Yosemite Entertainment for the development house.

Meanwhile, Sierra announced another reorganization, this time into three business units: Core Games, Casual Entertainment, and Home Productivity. This reorganization resulted in even more layoffs, eliminating 105 additional jobs and a number of games in production. After 1999, Sierra almost entirely ceased to be a developer of games and, as time went on, instead became a publisher of games by independent developers.

At the end of June 2000, a strategic business alliance between Vivendi, Seagram, and Canal+ was announced, and Vivendi Universal, a leading global media and communications company, was formed after the merger with Seagram (the parent company of Universal Studios). Havas S.A. was renamed Vivendi Universal Publishing and became the publishing division of the new group, divided into five groups: games, education, literature, health, and information. The merger was followed by many more layoffs of Sierra employees.

In August 2001, Sierra announced a major reorganization, which included the closure of Dynamix as well as the layoffs of 148 employees located at the company headquarters in Bellevue.

On February 19, 2002, Sierra On-Line officially announced the name change to Sierra Entertainment, Inc.

In 2002, Sierra, working with High Voltage Software, announced the development of a new chapter in the Leisure Suit Larry franchise, titled &quot;Leisure Suit Larry: Magna Cum Laude&quot;. Released to mostly mixed to negative reviews; Larry&#x27;s creator, Lowe, was not involved with the project.

The newly renamed Sierra Entertainment continued to develop mostly unsuccessful interactive entertainment products. However, hit &quot;Homeworld 2&quot; once again cemented Sierra&#x27;s reputation as a respectable publisher.

In 2003, Sierra Entertainment released the second video game adaptation of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, as well as &quot;NASCAR Racing 2003 Season&quot;.

=== Acquisition and absorption under Vivendi Games (2004–2008) ===

In early 2004, cost-cutting measures were taken at Sierra&#x27;s parent company Vivendi Universal Games due to financial troubles and because of Sierra&#x27;s lack of profitability as a working developer. Sierra&#x27;s last owned studios Impressions Games and the Papyrus Design Group were both shut down in early 2004, laying off 50 people; 180 Sierra-related positions were eliminated at Vivendi&#x27;s Los Angeles offices; and by June 2004, Vivendi had completely shut down Sierra&#x27;s Bellevue location, laid off more than 100 employees, dispersed Sierra&#x27;s work to other VU Games divisions, and re-located the remains of Sierra&#x27;s assets to Vivendi&#x27;s corporate headquarters in Fresno, California. In total, 350 people were laid off. Some assets were retired in the process, including Print Artist, and some like the &quot;Hoyle&quot; franchise were sold to other publishers or developers. Sierra was simply a publishing label and brand name for Vivendi assets, being used in tandem with its own name for publishing. As a company, Sierra was disestablished on August 24, 2004. The business continued to operate as a division of Vivendi Games.

In late 2005, the Sierra brand was re-launched from Los Angeles. A new subsidiary called Sierra Online (no-relation to Sierra&#x27;s former name Sierra On-Line) was also founded within this time, which focused on downloadable and online-only games.

Throughout 2005 and 2006, Vivendi acquired several game development studios including Massive Entertainment, High Moon Studios, Radical Entertainment, Secret Lair Studios / Studio Ch&#x27;in (based in Seattle and Shanghai) and Swordfish Studios and integrated them into Sierra, alongside the creative licenses from other Vivendi divisions and from companies partnered with Vivendi and the copyrights of several notable intellectual properties, such as &quot;Crash Bandicoot&quot;, &quot;Spyro the Dragon&quot;, &quot;50 Cent: Bulletproof&quot; and &quot;&quot;. Vivendi also ceased publishing under their own name by this point after their name change, with all major releases being under the Sierra brand name.

&quot;Caesar IV&quot; was published September 26, 2006, in North America, in partnership with Tilted Mill Entertainment.

In mid 2007, Sierra Online began launching Xbox Live Arcade games for the Xbox 360. One of the first releases is the conversion of the successful &quot;German-style&quot; board game &quot;Carcassonne&quot;, which had been in development at Secret Lair Studios.

In late 2007, Sierra released games like the first-person shooter game &quot;TimeShift&quot; (which was originally going to be published by Atari but was delayed various times during development) and the real-time tactical video game &quot;World in Conflict&quot;.

=== Closure and sale of properties (2008–2009) ===
In 2008, Sierra Entertainment&#x27;s parent company Vivendi Games merged with video game publisher Activision to form Activision Blizzard. Vivendi Games was absorbed into Activision after the merger and the ownership of Sierra properties went to Activision. Later that year, Sierra was closed down for possible future sale. Leading up to the merger, Activision&#x27;s management was confident that Sierra would cease operations post-merger.

On July 29, 2008, Activision announced a long-term strategy for its library of Sierra games and announced that they would only publish five titles: &quot;&quot;, &quot;The Legend of Spyro: Dawn of the Dragon&quot;, &quot;Prototype&quot;, and &quot;Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs&quot;, and an unannounced new property. The rest of the properties, including the Sierra Online division, were deemed by the company to be &quot;non-strategic&quot; with its then-current business practices. A selection of earlier sales and reversions followed:
* July 30, 2008 - The video game rights to the Robert Ludlum/&quot;Bourne&quot; franchise reverted back to Robert Ludlum&#x27;s estate through their Ludlum Entertainment subsidiary. Ludlum subsequently licensed these rights to Electronic Arts in February 2009.
* August 6, 2008 - Activision announced they have put Massive Entertainment up for sale, citing their disinterest in owning a European strategy developer, and that they were likely to sell &quot;World in Conflict&quot; and its dropped expansion pack &quot;Soviet Assault&quot; separately. Swordfish Studios was also put up for sale.
* August 13, 2008 - The video game licensing rights to &quot;Scarface&quot;, including a planned sequel to &quot;&quot;, reverted back to Universal Pictures.
* September 8, 2008 - Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment acquired the &quot;F.E.A.R.&quot; trademark as well as the original title, consisting of the base game and its outsourced expansion packs &quot;Extraction Point&quot; and &quot;Perseus Mandate&quot;. The purchase of the trademark allowed Monolith Productions, who developed the original game, to rename its upcoming sequel &quot;Project Origin&quot; as &quot;F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin&quot;.
* October 8, 2008 - Activision announced the closure of the online servers of several older Sierra games on November 1. The Sierra Online division was also closed within that period despite the fact that two more games would be published under that name in 2009.
* October 13, 2008 - THQ picked up the rights to &quot;50 Cent: Blood on the Sand&quot;.
* October 30, 2008 - Infogrames, the parent company of Atari, purchased publishing rights to &quot;&quot; and &quot;The Chronicles of Riddick: Assault on Dark Athena&quot;, and secured licensing rights from Sony and Universal respectively for future titles using both licenses.
* November 11, 2008 - Ubisoft purchased Massive Entertainment, in addition to purchasing the rights to &quot;World in Conflict&quot; .
* November 12, 2008 - Monumental Games purchased Swordfish Studios&#x27; Manchester development studio.
* November 15, 2008 - Codemasters purchased Swordfish Studios&#x27; remaining studio in Birmingham.
* December 12, 2008 - Electronic Arts purchased publishing rights to &quot;Brütal Legend&quot;.
* February 2009 - Codemasters purchased the &quot;Leisure Suit Larry&quot; IP and the publishing rights to &quot;Leisure Suit Larry: Box Office Bust&quot;.
* April 27, 2009 - Bethesda Softworks purchased the publishing rights to &quot;WET&quot;.
* July 14, 2009 - Rebellion Developments acquired several Sierra titles - &quot;Evil Genius&quot;, &quot;Ground Control&quot;, &quot;Empire Earth&quot;, &quot;Lords of Magic&quot; and &quot;Lords of the Realm&quot;.
* October 1, 2009 - Jeff Tunnell acquired &quot;The Incredible Machine&quot; through his company PushButton Labs.

=== Brand name revival under Activision (2014–2016) ===

On August 7, 2014, the website for Sierra, which previously redirected to Activision&#x27;s website, was updated to showcase a new logo, teasing: &quot;More to be revealed at Gamescom 2014.&quot; Activision confirmed that the Sierra label would re-release some of its older games, re-imagine its older franchises, and collaborate with indie studios to create new &quot;innovative, edgy and graphically unique&quot; projects. Sierra plans to focus on publishing downloadable games through PlayStation Network, Steam, and Xbox Live. Ken Williams said, &quot;We&#x27;re very proud of what we created all those years ago with Sierra On-Line, and today&#x27;s news about carrying Sierra forward as an indie-specific brand is very encouraging. We look forward to seeing Sierra&#x27;s independent spirit live on.&quot; That day, &quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot; and &quot;Geometry Wars 3: Dimensions&quot; were announced as the first two games published under the revived Sierra brand. On December 5, 2014, the company was awarded with the &quot;Industry Icon&quot; award during the 2014 The Game Awards, and it introduced the first footage of the reboot of &quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot;.

In August 2018, TJX Companies acquired the domain sierra.com from Activision, subsequently shortening the name of its Sierra Trading Post subsidiary to Sierra.

<doc id="52816" wikidata="Q279744" url="?curid=52816" title="Half-Life (video game)">
<text>Half-Life is a 1998 first-person shooter game developed by Valve Corporation and published by Sierra Studios for Windows. It was Valve&#x27;s debut product and the first game in the &quot;Half-Life&quot; series. The player assumes the role of Gordon Freeman, a scientist who must escape from the Black Mesa Research Facility after it is overrun by alien creatures following a disastrous scientific experiment. The gameplay consists of combat, exploration and puzzles.

Valve was disappointed with the lack of innovation in the FPS genre, and aimed to create an immersive world rather than a &quot;shooting gallery&quot;. Unlike other games at the time, the player has almost uninterrupted control of the player character; the story is mostly experienced through scripted sequences rather than cutscenes. Valve developed the game using GoldSrc, a heavily modified version of the &quot;Quake&quot; engine, licensed from id Software. The science fiction novelist Marc Laidlaw was hired to craft the plot and assist with design.

&quot;Half-Life&quot; received acclaim for its graphics, gameplay and narrative and won more than 50 PC &quot;Game of the Year&quot; awards. It is considered one of the most influential first-person shooter games and one of the greatest video games ever made. By 2008, it had sold more than nine million copies. It was ported to the PlayStation 2 in 2001, along with the multiplayer expansion &quot;Decay&quot;, and to OS X and Linux in 2013. Valve ported &quot;Half-Life&quot; to its Source engine as Half-Life: Source in 2004. In 2020, Crowbar Collective released an unofficial remake, &quot;Black Mesa&quot;.

&quot;Half-Life&quot; inspired numerous fan-made mods, some of which became standalone games, such as &quot;Counter-Strike&quot;, &quot;Day of Defeat&quot;, and &quot;Sven Co-op&quot;. It was followed by the expansion packs &quot;Opposing Force&quot; (1999) and &quot;Blue Shift&quot; (2001), developed by Gearbox Software, and the sequels &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; (2004), &quot;Episode One&quot; (2006), &quot;Episode Two&quot; (2007) and &quot;Half-Life: Alyx&quot; (2020).

== Gameplay ==
&quot;Half-Life&quot; is a first-person shooter that requires the player to perform combat tasks and puzzle solving to advance through the game. Unlike most first-person shooters at the time, which relied on cut-scene intermissions to detail their plotlines, &quot;Half-Life&quot;″s story is told mostly using scripted sequences (bar one short cutscene), keeping the player in control of the first-person viewpoint. In line with this, the player rarely loses the ability to control the player character, Gordon Freeman, who never speaks and is never actually seen in the game; the player sees &quot;through his eyes&quot; for the entire length of the game. &quot;Half-Life&quot; has no levels; it instead divides the game into chapters, whose titles briefly appear on screen as the player progresses through the game. With the exception of short loading pauses, progression throughout the game is continuous, with each map directly connecting to the next, with the exception of levels involving teleportation.

The game regularly integrates puzzles, such as navigating a maze of conveyor belts or using nearby boxes to build a small staircase to the next area the player must travel to. Some puzzles involve using the environment to kill an enemy, like turning a valve to spray hot steam at their enemies. There are few bosses in the conventional sense, where the player defeats a superior opponent by direct confrontation. Instead, such organisms occasionally define chapters, and the player is generally expected to use the terrain, rather than firepower, to kill the boss. Late in the game, the player receives a &quot;long jump module&quot; for the HEV suit, which allows the player to increase the horizontal distance and speed of jumps by crouching before jumping. The player must rely on this ability to navigate various platformer-style jumping puzzles in Xen toward the end of the game.

The player battles alone for the majority of the game, but is occasionally assisted by non-player characters; specifically security guards and scientists who help the player. The guards will fight alongside the player, and both guards and scientists can assist in reaching new areas and pass on relevant plot information. An array of alien enemies populate the game, including headcrabs, bullsquids, vortigaunts, and headcrab zombies. The player also faces hostile human soldiers and Black Ops assassins. &quot;Half-Life&quot; includes online multiplayer support for both individual and team-based deathmatch modes. It was one of the first mainstream games to use the WASD keys as the default control scheme.

== Plot ==
At the underground Black Mesa Research Facility, physicist Gordon Freeman participates in an experiment on a crystal of unknown origin. This triggers a resonance cascade, which causes widespread damage and teleports in hostile alien creatures. Venturing to the surface, Freeman discovers government soldiers have been dispatched to cover up the incident by killing humans and aliens alike. He is instructed by a scientist to make his way to the Lambda Complex to stop the alien invasion. 

Freeman kills a giant creature inside a rocket engine test facility. He uses an underground monorail to reach a rocket silo, where he launches a satellite to help the Lambda team. Freeman is captured by soldiers and left for dead inside a trash compactor. Escaping through a waste treatment complex, he discovers a laboratory filled with alien specimens, collected long before the resonance cascade.

Overpowered by the aliens, the soldiers begin to withdraw. Freeman fights across a military base to reach the Lambda Complex, where he discovers secret teleportation technology. There, scientists inform him that a powerful alien creature is preventing them from closing the portal. They teleport him to the alien dimension of Xen to kill it.

Freeman encounters dead scientists who teleported there before him. He kills a large alien, the Gonarch, and finds a factory that manufactures alien soldiers. Finally, he discovers the Nihilanth&#x27;s lair and kills it. Freeman is detained by the G-Man, a mysterious interdimensional agent who claims his &quot;employers&quot; wish to hire him. If he accepts, Freeman is placed into stasis; if not, he is teleported to his death.

Valve, based in Kirkland, Washington, was founded in 1996 by the former Microsoft employees Gabe Newell and Mike Harrington. For their first product, Valve settled on a concept for a horror first-person shooter (FPS) game. They did not want to build their own game engine, as this would have created too much work for a small team and Newell planned to innovate in different areas. Instead, Valve licensed the &quot;Quake&quot; engine and the &quot;Quake II&quot; engine from id Software and combined them with their own code. Newell estimated that around 75% of the final engine code was by Valve. As the project expanded, Valve cancelled development of a fantasy role-playing game, &quot;Prospero&quot;, and the &quot;Prospero&quot; team joined the &quot;Half-Life&quot; project.

&quot;Half-Life&quot; was inspired by the FPS games &quot;Doom&quot; (1993) and &quot;Quake&quot; (1996), Stephen King&#x27;s 1980 novella &quot;The Mist&quot;, and a 1963 episode of &quot;The Outer Limits&quot; titled &quot;The Borderland&quot;. According to the designer Harry Teasley, &quot;Doom&quot; was a major influence and the team wanted &quot;Half-Life&quot; to &quot;scare you like &quot;Doom&quot; did&quot;. The project had the working title &quot;Quiver&quot;, after the Arrowhead military base from &quot;The Mist&quot;. The name &quot;Half-Life&quot; was chosen because it was evocative of the theme, not clichéd, and had a corresponding visual symbol: the Greek letter λ (lower-case lambda), which represents the &quot;decay constant&quot; in the half-life equation. According to the designer Brett Johnson, the level design was inspired by environments in the manga series &quot;Akira&quot;.

Valve struggled to find a publisher, as many believed the game was too ambitious for a first-time developer. Sierra On-Line signed Valve for a one-game deal as it was interested in making a 3D action game, especially one based on the &quot;Quake&quot; engine. Sierra gave Valve an advance of around $1 million in exchange for 30% of the revenue and 100% of the intellectual property; the rest of development was funded by Newell and Harrington. Valve first showed &quot;Half-Life&quot; in early 1997; it was a success at E3 that year, where Valve demonstrated the animation and artificial intelligence. Novel features of the artificial intelligence included fear and pack behavior.

Valve aimed for a November 1997 release to compete with &quot;Quake II&quot;. By September 1997, the team found that while they had built some innovative aspects in weapons, enemies, and level design, the game was not fun and there was little design cohesion. Playtesting produced &quot;lukewarm&quot; responses. Sierra would not agree to extra funding, so Newell took out a loan to fund additional development to rework the game.

Valve took a novel approach of assigning a small team to build a prototype level containing every element in the game and then spent a month iterating on the level. When the rest of the team played the level, which the designer Ken Birdwell described as &quot;&quot;Die Hard&quot; meets &quot;Evil Dead&quot;&quot;, they agreed to use it as a baseline. The team developed three theories about what made the level fun. First, it had several interesting things happen in it, all triggered by the player rather than a timer so that the player would set the pace of the level. Second, the level responded to any player action, even for something as simple as adding graphic decals to wall textures to show a bullet impact. Finally, the level warned the player of imminent danger to allow them to avoid it, rather than killing the player with no warning.

To move forward with this unified design, Valve sought a game designer but found no one suitable. Instead, Valve created the &quot;cabal&quot;, initially a group of six individuals from across all departments that worked primarily for six months straight in six-hour meetings four days a week. The cabal was responsible for all elements of design, including level layouts, key events, enemy designs, narrative, and the introduction of gameplay elements relative to the story. The collaboration proved successful, and once the cabal had come to decisions on types of gameplay elements that would be needed, mini-cabals from other departments most affected by the choice were formed to implement these elements. Membership in the main cabal rotated since the required commitment created burnout.

The cabal produced a 200-page design document detailing nearly every aspect of the game. They also produced a 30-page document for the narrative, and hired the science fiction novelist Marc Laidlaw to help manage the script. Laidlaw said his contribution was to add &quot;old storytelling tricks&quot; to the team&#x27;s ambitious designs: &quot;I was in awe of [the team]. It felt to me like I was just borrowing from old standards while they were the ones doing something truly new.&quot; Rather than dictate narrative elements &quot;from some kind of ivory tower of authorial inspiration&quot;, he worked with the team to improvise ideas, and was inspired by their experiments. For example, he conceived the opening train ride after an engineer implemented train code for another concept.

Valve initially planned to use traditional cutscenes, but switched to a continuous first-person perspective for lack of time. Laidlaw said they discovered unexpected advantages in this approach, as it created a sense of immersion and enforced a sense of loneliness in a frightening environment. Laidlaw felt that non-player characters were unnecessary to guide players if the design had sufficiently strong &quot;visual grammar&quot;, and that this allowed the characters to &quot;feel like characters instead of signposts&quot;. An early version of &quot;Half-Life&quot; began immediately after the disaster, with the environments already wrecked. Laidlaw worked with Johnson to create versions of the lab environment before the disaster to help set the story. He said: &quot;These were all economical ways of doing storytelling with the architecture — which was my whole obsession. The narrative had to be baked into the corridors.&quot;

Within a month of the cabal&#x27;s formation, the other team members started detailed game development, and within another month began playtesting through Sierra. The cabal was intimately involved with playtesting, monitoring the player but otherwise not interacting. They noted any confusion or inability to solve a game&#x27;s puzzles and made them into action items to be fixed on the next iteration. Later, with most of the main adjustments made, the team included means to benchmark players&#x27; actions. They then collected and interpreted statistically to fine-tune levels further. Between the cabal and playtesting, Valve identified and removed parts that proved unenjoyable. Birdwell said that while there were struggles at first, the cabal approach was critical for &quot;Half-Life&quot;″s success, and was reused for &quot;Team Fortress 2&quot; from the start.

Much of the detail of &quot;Half-Life&quot; development has been lost. According to Valve employee Erik Johnson, two or three months before release, their Visual SourceSafe source control system &quot;exploded&quot;. Logs of technical changes from before the final month of development were lost, and code had to be recovered from individual computers. The revised version of &quot;Half-Life&quot; shown at E3 1998 was received the Game Critics Awards for &quot;Best PC Game&quot; and &quot;Best Action Game&quot;.

== Release ==
To promote &quot;Half-Life&quot;, Valve&#x27;s chief marketing officer, Monica Harrington, promoted Valve&#x27;s reputation in the industry, with conference talks about their advances in game development, leading to coverage in the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;. 

&quot;Half-Life&quot; was released on November 19, 1998. When Sierra told Valve it was not planning to promote it beyond launch, Monica Harrington threatened that Valve would &quot;walk away from our agreement and tell the industry that had fallen in love with Valve how screwed up Sierra really was&quot;. In response, Sierra reissued &quot;Half-Life&quot; in a &quot;Game of the Year&quot; edition, boosting sales. In 2001, after renegotiating with Sierra, Valve gained the &quot;Half-Life&quot; intellectual property and online distribution rights for its games.

Valve released two &quot;Half-Life&quot; demos. The first, &quot;Half-Life: Day One&quot;, contained the first fifth of the game and was distributed with certain graphic cards. The second, &quot;Half-Life: Uplink&quot;, was released on February 12, 1999, and featured original content. A short film based on &quot;Half-Life,&quot; also titled &quot;Half-Life: Uplink&quot;, was developed by Cruise Control, a British marketing agency, and released on February 11, 1999. The protagonist is a journalist who infiltrates the Black Mesa Research Facility, trying to discover what has happened there.

&quot;Half-Life&quot; was censored in Germany to comply with the Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons, which regulates depictions of violence against humans. Valve replaced the human characters with robots, spilling oil and gears instead of blood and body parts when killed, among other changes. In 2017, &quot;Half-Life&quot; was removed from the German censorship list. To acknowledge this, Valve released &quot;Half-Life Uncensored&quot;, a free downloadable content pack, that reverts the censorship.

=== Ports ===
Valve canceled a version of &quot;Half-Life&quot; for Mac, developed by Logicware, in 2000. Newell said the port was substandard and would have made Mac players &quot;second-class customers&quot;. Rebecca Heineman, the co-founder of Logicware, denied this, saying that Valve cancelled the port as Apple had angered them by misrepresenting sales projections. She said the port was complete and three weeks from release. Valve released ports for OS X and Linux in 2013.

Captivation Digital Laboratories and Gearbox Software developed a port of &quot;Half-Life&quot; for the Dreamcast, with new character models and textures and an exclusive expansion, &quot;Blue Shift&quot;. Following the cancellations of several third-party Dreamcast games in the wake of Sega&#x27;s decision to discontinue the console in March 2001, Sierra cancelled the port weeks before its scheduled release in June, citing &quot;changing marketing conditions&quot;. &quot;Blue Shift&quot; was ported to Windows. The Dreamcast port became the basis of the &quot;Half-Life&quot; port for PlayStation 2, released in late 2001. This version added competitive play and a co-op expansion, &quot;Half-Life: Decay.&quot;

=== Remastered version ===
In 2004, Valve released &quot;Half-Life: Source&quot;, a remastered version of &quot;Half-Life&quot; created in their new game engine, Source. It includes no new graphical elements, but adds new physics, water effects and 5.1 surround sound. It received negative reviews for its glitches and lack of new content. Following the release of the 25th anniversary update in 2023, &quot;Half-Life: Source&quot; was unlisted from Steam and does not appear in its search results. 

=== Remake ===
&quot;Black Mesa&quot;, a third-party remake of &quot;Half-Life&quot; developed by Crowbar Collective on the Source engine, was published as a free mod in September 2012 and later approved by Valve for a commercial standalone release.

===25th anniversary update===

In November 2023, for the 25th anniversary of &quot;Half-Life&quot;, Valve updated the Steam version to revert content to its original 1998 state, fix long-standing bugs, and add content including the &quot;Half-Life: Uplink&quot; demo, four new multiplayer maps, Steam Deck support, rendering improvements, and support for 4K resolution monitors. Valve also released an hour-long documentary on the creation of &quot;Half-Life&quot;, featuring commentary from the original developers, designers and artists. Two days after the release, &quot;Half-Life&quot; reached 33,471 concurrent players on Steam, its highest-ever number.

== Additional content ==
=== Expansions ===
&quot;Half-Life&quot; was followed by an expansion pack, &quot;Opposing Force&quot;, on November 1, 1999, developed by Gearbox Software. Players control Hazardous Environment Combat Unit (HECU) Corporal Adrian Shephard, who fights a new group of aliens called Race X and Black Ops units after being split from his team. Gearbox developed a second expansion pack, &quot;Blue Shift&quot;, in which players control Barney Calhoun, a security guard at Black Mesa, as he attempts to escape the facility. It was developed as a bonus campaign for the Dreamcast port of &quot;Half-Life,&quot; but was released for Windows on June 12, 2001, after the port was canceled. Gearbox created a cooperative multiplayer expansion pack, &quot;Decay,&quot; exclusively for the PlayStation 2 port of &quot;Half-Life&quot; which is played through the perspectives of Gina Cross and Colette Green, two Black Mesa scientists.

=== Mods ===
&quot;Half-Life&quot; received support from independent game developers, supported and encouraged by Valve. With the game, Valve included Worldcraft, the level design tool used during development, and a software development kit, enabling developers to modify the game and create mods. Both tools were updated with the release of the version 1.1.0.0 patch. Supporting tools (including texture editors, model editors, and level editors such as the multiple engine editor QuArK) were either created or updated to work with &quot;Half-Life&quot;.

The &quot;Half-Life&quot; software development kit served as the development base for many mods, including the Valve-developed &quot;Team Fortress Classic&quot; and &quot;Deathmatch Classic&quot; (a remake of &quot;Quake&quot;″s multiplayer deathmatch mode in the GoldSrc engine). Other mods such as &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; and &quot;Day of Defeat&quot; (&quot;DOD&quot;) began life as the work of independent developers who later received aid from Valve. Other multiplayer mods include &quot;Firearms&quot;, &quot;Natural Selection&quot; and &quot;Sven Co-op&quot;. Single-player mods include &quot;USS Darkstar&quot; (1999, a futuristic action-adventure on board a zoological research spaceship) and &quot;They Hunger&quot; (2000–2001, a survival horror total conversion trilogy involving zombies).

Some &quot;Half-Life&quot; modifications received retail releases. &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; was the most successful, having been released in six different editions: as a standalone product (2000), as part of the &quot;Platinum Pack&quot; (2000), as an Xbox version (2003), and as a single-player spin-off, &quot;Counter-Strike: Condition Zero&quot; (2004), as well as in two versions using the Source engine. &quot;Team Fortress Classic&quot;, &quot;Day of Defeat&quot;, &quot;Gunman Chronicles&quot; (2000, a futuristic Western movie-style total conversion with emphasis on its single-player mode) and &quot;Sven Co-op&quot; were also released as standalone products. &quot;Half-Life&quot; is also the subject of the YouTube improv roleplaying series &quot;Half-Life VR but the AI is Self-Aware&quot; and &quot;Freeman&#x27;s Mind&quot;.

In 2003, Valve&#x27;s network was infiltrated by hackers. Among the stolen files was the unreleased &quot;Half-Life&quot; mod &quot;Half-Life: Threewave&quot;, a canceled remake of the &quot;Quake&quot; mod &quot;Threewave CTF&quot;. The files were found by fans on a Vietnamese FTP server in February 2016 and unofficially distributed that September.

== Reception ==
=== Critical reception ===
On the review aggregation website Metacritic, &quot;Half-Life&quot; has a score of 96 out of 100. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;″s Jeff Green said it was &quot;not just one of the best games of the year. It&#x27;s one of the best games of any year, an instant classic that is miles better than any of its immediate competition, and – in its single-player form – is the best shooter since the original &quot;Doom.&quot;&quot; &quot;Next Generation&quot; wrote: &quot;It is fast paced, it is dramatic, and it brings the very idea of adventure on a PC out of the dark ages and into a 3D world. All that and not a single Orc in sight.&quot; &quot;IGN&quot; described it as &quot;a tour de force in game design, the definitive single player game in a first-person shooter&quot;. &quot;GameSpot&quot; said it was the &quot;closest thing to a revolutionary step the genre has ever taken&quot;.

Several reviewers cited the level of immersion and interactivity as revolutionary. &quot;AllGame&quot; said, &quot;It isn&#x27;t everyday that you come across a game that totally revolutionizes an entire genre, but Half-Life has done just that.&quot; &quot;Hot Games&quot; commented on the realism, and how the environment &quot;all adds up to a totally immersive gaming experience that makes everything else look quite shoddy in comparison&quot;. &quot;Gamers Depot&quot; wrote that it was the most immersive game they had played.

The final portion of the game, taking place in the alien world of Xen, was generally considered the weakest. Besides introducing a wholly new and alien setting, it also featured a number of low-gravity jumping puzzles. The GoldSrc engine did not provide as much precise control for the player during jumping, making these jumps difficult and often with Freeman falling into a void and the player restarting the game. &quot;Wired&quot; Julie Muncy called the Xen sequence &quot;an abbreviated, unpleasant stop on an alien world with bad platforming and a boss fight against what appeared, by all accounts, to be a giant floating infant&quot;. &quot;The Electric Playground&quot; said that &quot;Half-Life&quot; was an &quot;immersive and engaging entertainment experience&quot; in its first half and that it &quot;peaked too soon&quot;.

During the AIAS&#x27; 2nd Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, &quot;Half-Life&quot; was awarded &quot;Computer Entertainment Title of the Year&quot; and &quot;PC Action Game of the Year&quot;; it also received nominations for &quot;Game of the Year&quot; and outstanding achievement in &quot;Art/Graphics&quot;, &quot;Character or Story Development&quot;, &quot;Interactive Design&quot;, and &quot;Software Engineering&quot;.

Jeff Lundrigan reviewed the PlayStation 2 version for &quot;Next Generation&quot;, rating it three out of five, and wrote that &quot;it may be getting old, but there&#x27;s still a surprising amount of life in &quot;Half-Life&quot;&quot;. The PlayStation 2 version was a nominee for &quot;The Electric Playground&quot;″s 2001 Blister Awards for &quot;Best Console Shooter Game&quot;, but lost to &quot;&quot; for Xbox.

In 1999, 2001, and 2005, &quot;PC Gamer&quot; named &quot;Half-Life&quot; the best PC game of all time. In 2004, &quot;GameSpy&quot; readers voted &quot;Half-Life&quot; the best game of all time. &quot;Gamasutra&quot; gave it their Quantum Leap Award in the FPS category in 2006. GameSpot inducted &quot;Half-Life&quot; into their Greatest Games of All Time list in May 2007. In 2007, &quot;IGN&quot; described &quot;Half-Life&quot; as one of the most influential video games, and in 2013 wrote that the history of the FPS genre &quot;breaks down pretty cleanly into pre-&quot;Half-Life&quot; and post-&quot;Half-Life&quot; eras&quot;. In 2021, the &quot;Guardian&quot; ranked &quot;Half-Life&quot; the third-greatest game of the 1990s, writing that it &quot;helped write the rulebook for how games tell their stories without resorting to aping the conventions of film&quot;.

=== Sales ===
According to Newell, &quot;Half-Life&quot; was budgeted with the expectation of lifetime sales of around 180,000 copies. However, it was a surprise hit. In the United States, &quot;Half-Life&quot; debuted at #8 on PC Data&#x27;s weekly PC game sales chart for the November 15–21 period, with an average retail price (ARP) of $49. It rose to sixth place the following week, before dropping to position 10 for the week ending December 5. During the December 6–12 period, the game climbed back to sixth place; by this time, its ARP had dropped to $36. It placed between sixth and eighth on PC Data&#x27;s weekly charts through the end of December, and its ARP rose back to $45 by the week ending January 2. PC Data declared &quot;Half-Life&quot; November&#x27;s sixth-best-selling PC game in the United States, a position it held for the month of December. While its US sales were below 100,000 copies by November 30, by 1999 it had sold 212,173 copies and earned revenues of $8.6 million in the United States by the end of 1998.

In January 1999, &quot;Half-Life&quot; debuted at #3 on Chart-Track&#x27;s PC game sales rankings for the United Kingdom, and remained in PC Data&#x27;s weekly top 10 for the entire month, peaking at #4. By January 19, after two full months of availability, global sales of &quot;Half-Life&quot; surpassed 500,000 units. In the United States, it was the fifth-best-selling PC game for the month of January. On PC Data&#x27;s weekly charts, it rose to #2 from February 7–20, with an ARP of $35. Holding a position in the weekly top 10 for the rest of February, it climbed to fourth for the month. The game remained in PC Data&#x27;s weekly top 10 until the week of March 21 and dropped to position 11 for March as a whole. In the United Kingdom, it placed second in February—behind the debut of &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot;—and fifth in March. In April, it claimed #3 on Chart-Track&#x27;s rankings and dropped to #16 on those of PC Data. On April 23, Sierra announced that global sales of &quot;Half-Life&quot; had reached almost 1 million copies.

After maintaining the 16th place for May in the US, &quot;Half-Life&quot; exited PC Data&#x27;s monthly top 20 in June. &quot;Half-Life&quot; became the fifth-bestselling PC game of the first half of 1999 in the US. Its domestic sales during 1999 reached 290,000 copies by the end of September. During 1999, it was the fifth-best-selling PC game in the US, with sales of 445,123 copies. These sales brought in revenues of $16.6 million, the sixth-highest gross that year for a PC game in the US. The following year, it was the 16th-bestselling PC game in the US, selling another 286,593 copies and earning $8.98 million.

The PlayStation 2 version received a &quot;Silver&quot; sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom. &quot;Half-Life&quot;″s global sales reached 2.5 million units by July 2001. &quot;Edge&quot; noted in 2003 that &quot;a significant number of the 7.5m copies of the PC version were bought because the game offered such potential for community-driven expansion&quot;. As of November 16, 2004, eight million copies of the game had been sold, by 2008, 9.3 million copies had been sold at retail. &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; awarded &quot;Half-Life&quot; the world record for Best-Selling First-Person Shooter of All Time (PC) in the &quot;Guinness World Records: Gamer&#x27;s Edition 2008&quot;.

== Sequels ==
&quot;Half-Life 2&quot; was announced at E3 2003 and released in 2004. The player controls Freeman 20 years after the Black Mesa incident in the dystopian City 17, where he joins a rebellion against an alien regime. It was followed by the episodic sequels &quot;Half-Life 2: Episode One&quot; (2006) and &quot;Half-Life 2: Episode Two&quot; (2007). After cancelling several other &quot;Half-Life&quot; projects, Valve released &quot;Half-Life: Alyx&quot; in 2020.

<text>County Leitrim ( ; ) is a county in Ireland. It is in the province of Connacht and is part of the Northern and Western Region. It is named after the village of Leitrim. Leitrim County Council is the local authority for the county, which had a population of 35,199 according to the 2022 census.

The county encompasses the historic Gaelic territory of West Breffny () corresponding to the northern part of the county, and Muintir Eolais or Conmaicne Réin, corresponding to the southern part.

==Geography==

Leitrim is the 26th in size of the 32 counties by area (21st of the 26 counties of the Republic) and the smallest by population. It is the smallest of Connacht&#x27;s five counties in both size and population. Leitrim is bordered by the counties of Donegal to the north, Fermanagh to the north-east, Cavan to the east, Longford to the south, Roscommon to the south-west and Sligo to the west. Fermanagh is in Northern Ireland while all the other neighbouring counties are within the Republic of Ireland.

Leitrim has a hilly and mountainous landscape in its northwest and is relatively flat in the southeast, each separated from the other by Lough Allen in the middle of the county. Leitrim has the shortest length of coastline of any Irish county that touches the sea. At Tullaghan, the coastline is only long. The Shannon is linked to the Erne via the Shannon–Erne Waterway. Notable lakes include:
*Lough Melvin 
*Lough Allen
*Lough Gill is to the northwest of Dromahair; Parke&#x27;s Castle is located on the lakeshore.
*Belhavel Lough is also located in Dromahair, within the parish of Killargue.
*Lough Scur, and Saint John&#x27;s Lough, on the Shannon–Erne Waterway.
*Glencar Lough which lies mostly in Leitrim is fed via Glencar waterfall made famous in the poem The Stolen Child by W. B. Yeats.
*Rockfield Lake, just east of Carrigallen in South Leitrim, is popular with anglers; while part of this lake is in County Leitrim, most of it is in County Cavan
*Other lakes include Upper Lough MacNean, Glenade Lough, Garadice Lough, Rinn Lough, Lough Scannal, Lough Erril and Lough Machugh.

==History==
In ancient times Leitrim formed the western half of the Kingdom of Breifne. This region was long influenced by the O&#x27;Rourke family of Dromahair, whose heraldic lion occupies the official county shield to this day. Close ties initially existed with the O&#x27;Reilly clan in the eastern half of the kingdom, however, a split occurred in the 13th century and the kingdom was divided into East Breifne, now County Cavan, and West Breifne, now County Leitrim. The Normans invaded south Leitrim in the 13th century but were defeated at the Battle of Áth an Chip in 1270.

Much of the county was confiscated from its owners in 1620 and given to Villiers and Hamilton. Their initial objective was to plant the county with English settlers. However, this proved unsuccessful. English Deputy Sir John Perrot had ordered the legal establishment of &quot;Leitrim County&quot; a half-century prior, in 1565. Perrott also demarcated the current county borders around 1583.
Long ago Ireland was covered in woodland, and five great forests are traditionally said to have stood in Leitrim, with a 19th-century county survey stating- &quot;a hundred years ago almost the whole country was one continued, undivided forest, so that from Drumshanbo to Drumkeeran, a distance of nine or ten miles, one could travel the whole way from tree to tree by branches&quot;. Many of these great forests were denuded for the making of charcoal for iron works around Sliabh an Iarainn. Working of the county&#x27;s rich deposits of iron ore began in the 15th century and continued until the mid-18th century. Coal mining became prominent in the 19th century to the east of Lough Allen at Sliabh an Iarainn and also to the west in Arigna, on the Roscommon border. The last coal mine closed in July 1990 and there is now a visitor centre. Sandstone was also quarried in the Glenfarne region.
Writing in 1791, the geographer Beaufort suggested the county housing population encompassed 10,026 homes with &quot;upwards of 50,000 inhabitants&quot;, the primary agriculture being cattle production, and the growth of flax sustaining the linen industry. Leitrim was first hit by the recession caused by the mechanisation of linen weaving in the 1830s and its 155,000 residents (as of the 1841 census) were ravaged by the Great Famine and the population dropped to 112,000 by 1851. The population subsequently continued to decrease due to emigration. After many years, the wounds of such rapid population decline have finally started to heal. Agriculture improved over the last century. Leitrim now has the fastest growing population in Connacht.

The &quot;Book of Fenagh&quot; is the most famous medieval manuscript originating here. In the 19th century the poet John McDonald (of Dromod) lived in the county, and William Butler Yeats spent the turn of the twentieth century fascinated with Lough Allen and much of Leitrim. Glencar Waterfall, from Manorhamilton, inspired Yeats and is mentioned in his poem The Stolen Child.

==Subdivisions==

Geographically, the county is almost evenly divided along north–south lines by Lough Allen, the River Shannon and Sliabh an Iarainn. Uniquely among Irish counties, there is no way to cross from the north of the county to the south (or vice versa) by road without leaving its boundaries. North Leitrim is slightly larger than the south, comprising 51% of County Leitrim&#x27;s land area. However, South Leitrim, with towns such as Carrick-on-Shannon, Ballinamore and Drumshambo, is significantly more populous, containing approximately 65% of the county&#x27;s population as of 2016.

===Baronies===
There are five historic baronies in the county. While baronies continue to be officially defined units, they are no longer used for many administrative purposes. Their official status is illustrated by Placenames Orders made since 2003, where official Irish names of baronies are listed under &quot;Administrative units&quot;. They are Carrigallen, Drumahaire, Leitrim, Mohill and Rosclogher.

===Rural districts===

==Demographics==
*Leitrim has the fastest-growing population of any county in Connacht. As measured by the census, the population rose by 36% between 2002 and 2022 to 35,087.
*2005 HEA statistics identified that Leitrim has the highest rate of participation in higher education in Ireland with 75% of 17- to 19-year-olds being admitted to a higher course.
*The county town is Carrick-on-Shannon (population 4,062). It is a highly developed, prospering river port on the River Shannon and many tourists hire cruising boats here to explore the Shannon and the Shannon–Erne Waterway, which is a 63 km canal linking the two river systems. It is amongst the fastest growing towns in Ireland and has grown by 25% in the past few years.

==Local government and politics==
Leitrim County Council is the local authority for the county. The county is divided into three local electoral areas, each of which is also a municipal district: Ballinamore (6 councillors), Carrick-on-Shannon (6 councillors), and Manorhamilton (6 councillors). Leitrim County Council has two representatives on the Northern and Western Regional Assembly.

===2019 seats summary===
The following were elected at the 2019 Leitrim County Council election:
===National politics===
Leitrim is part of the Dáil constituency of Sligo–Leitrim. This constituency existed from 1948 to 2007, and previously from 1923 to 1937 as Leitrim–Sligo. From 1937 to 1948, the county formed the Leitrim constituency. From 2007 until 2016, County Leitrim was divided between two constituencies: Roscommon–South Leitrim and Sligo–North Leitrim. This proved controversial, and at the 2007 general election there was no TD elected whose domicile was in the county. Sligo–Leitrim was recreated at the 2016 general election.

==Transport==

*Supplementing the local and regional road networks are the N15 (Sligo-Leitrim-Donegal), N16 (Sligo-Leitrim-Enniskillen) and N4 (Sligo-Leitrim-Dublin) national roads.
*Railway stations in Leitrim on the Dublin to Sligo line include Dromod and Carrick-on-Shannon.
*The Cavan and Leitrim Railway opened on 17 October 1887. It consisted of two branches, meeting at Ballinamore which connected Dromod and Arigna with Belturbet. Services carried goods, passengers and coal from around Lough Allen. Although protested, the line finally closed on 31 March 1959. A revived heritage railway centre and transport museum with a running line has been based at Dromod since the 1990s.
*Railway stations in Leitrim on the former Sligo, Leitrim and Northern Counties Railway (which ran between Sligo and Enniskillen) included Dromahair, Manorhamilton and Glenfarne.
*The Shannon and Shannon–Erne Waterway give access to much of Leitrim by boat.

<text>County Londonderry (Ulster-Scots: &quot;Coontie Lunnonderrie&quot;), also known as County Derry (), is one of the six counties of Northern Ireland, one of the thirty-two counties of Ireland and one of the nine counties of Ulster. Before the partition of Ireland, it was one of the counties of the Kingdom of Ireland from 1613 onward and then of the United Kingdom after the Acts of Union 1800. Adjoining the north-west shore of Lough Neagh, the county covers an area of and today has a population of about 252,231.

Since 1972, the counties in Northern Ireland, including Londonderry, have no longer been used by the state as part of the local administration. Following further reforms in 2015, the area is now governed under three different districts: Derry and Strabane, Causeway Coast and Glens and Mid-Ulster. Despite no longer being used for local government and administrative purposes, it is sometimes used in a cultural context in All-Ireland sporting and cultural events (i.e. Derry GAA).

Since 1981, it has become one of four counties in Northern Ireland that has a Catholic majority (55.56% according to the 2001 Census and 61.3% according to the 2021 Census). The county flower is the purple saxifrage.

== Name ==
The place name &quot;Derry&quot; is an anglicisation of the Old Irish &quot;Daire&quot; (Modern Irish &quot;Doire&quot;), meaning &quot;oak-grove&quot; or &quot;oak-wood&quot;.

As with the city, its name is subject to the Derry/Londonderry name dispute, with the form &quot;Londonderry&quot; generally preferred by unionists and &quot;Derry&quot; by nationalists. Unlike with the city, however, there has never been a County Derry. County Londonderry was formed mostly from the old County Coleraine (see below). British authorities use the name &quot;Londonderry&quot;, while &quot;Derry&quot; is used by the Republic of Ireland.

== History ==

===Prehistoric===
The county has a significant of megalithic structures from prehistoric times, including Ballygroll Prehistoric Landscape, as well as numerous others. The most significant site however is Mountsandel, located near Coleraine in County Londonderry is &quot;perhaps the oldest recorded settlement within Ireland&quot;.

===County Coleraine and the Plantation of Ulster===
At an early period, what became the county of Coleraine was inhabited by the O&#x27;Cahans, who were tributary to the O&#x27;Neills. Towards the close of the reign of Elizabeth I their territory was seized by England, with the purpose of checking the power of the O&#x27;Neills, and was made the county of Coleraine, named after the regional capital.

A short description of County Coleraine is given in Harris&#x27;s &quot;Hibernica&quot;, and also in Captain Pynnar&#x27;s &quot;Survey of the Escheated Counties of Ulster, Anno 1618&quot;:

On 2 March 1613, James I granted a charter to The Honourable The Irish Society to undertake the plantation of a new county. This county was named Londonderry, a combination of London (in reference to the Livery Companies of the Irish Society) and Derry (then name of the city). This charter declared that the &quot;City of Londonderry&quot; and everything contained within the new county:
This new county would comprise the then County Coleraine—which consisted of the baronies of Tirkeeran, Coleraine, and Keenaght—and at the behest of The Irish Society the following additional territory was added: all but the south-west corner of the barony of Loughinsholin, then a part of County Tyrone, as it had sufficient wood for construction; the North East Liberties of Coleraine, which was part of County Antrim and the City of Londonderry and its Liberties, which were in County Donegal, so that they could control both banks of the River Foyle and River Bann.

The Irish Society was made up of the twelve main livery companies of London, which themselves were composed of various guilds. Whilst The Irish Society as a whole was given possession of the city of Londonderry and Coleraine, the individual companies were each granted an estimated throughout the county. These companies and the sites of their headquarters were:
*Clothworkers, based at Killowen and Clothworker&#x27;s Hall (present-day Articlave) in the barony of Coleraine;
*Drapers, based at Draper&#x27;s Hall, later called Drapers Town (present-day Moneymore) in the barony of Loughinsholin;
*Fishmongers, based at Artikelly and Fishermonger&#x27;s Hall (present-day Ballykelly) in the barony of Keenaght;
*Goldsmiths, based at Goldsmith&#x27;s Hall (present-day Newbuildings) in the barony of Tirkeeran;
*Grocers, based at Grocer&#x27;s Hall, alias Muff (present-day Eglinton) in the barony of Tirkeeran;
*Haberdashers, based at Habberdasher&#x27;s Hall (present-day Ballycastle) in the barony of Keenaght;
*Ironmongers, based at Ironmonger&#x27;s Hall (present-day townland of Agivey) in the barony of Coleraine;
*Mercers, based at Mercer&#x27;s Hall (present-day townland of Movanagher) in the barony of Coleraine;
*Merchant Taylors, based at Merchant Taylor&#x27;s Hall (present-day Macosquin) in the barony of Coleraine;
*Salters, based at Salter&#x27;s Hall (present-day Magherafelt) and Salters Town in the barony of Loughinsholin;
*Skinners, based at Skinner&#x27;s Hall (present-day Dungiven) in the barony of Keenaght;
*Vintners, based at Vintner&#x27;s Hall, later called Vintner&#x27;s Town (present-day Bellaghy) in the barony of Loughinsholin.

===19th century===
As a result of the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898, the city was detached from the county for administrative purposes, becoming a separate county borough from 1899. The county town of County Londonderry, and seat of the Londonderry County Council until its abolition in 1973, was therefore moved to the town of Coleraine.
==Geography and places of interest==
The highest point in the county is the summit of Sawel Mountain () on the border with County Tyrone. Sawel is part of the Sperrin Mountains, which dominate the southern part of the county. To the east and west, the land falls into the valleys of the Bann and Foyle rivers respectively; in the south-east, the county touches the shore of Lough Neagh, which is the largest lake in Ireland; the north of the county is distinguished by the steep cliffs, dune systems, and remarkable beaches of the Atlantic coast.

The county is home to a number of important buildings and landscapes, including the well-preserved 17th-century city walls of Derry; the National Trust–owned Plantation estate at Springhill; Mussenden Temple on the Atlantic coast; the dikes, artificial coastlines and the bird sanctuaries on the eastern shore of Lough Foyle; and the visitor centre at Bellaghy Bawn, close to the childhood home of Nobel laureate Seamus Heaney. In the centre of the county are the old-growth deciduous forests at Banagher and Ness Wood, where the Burntollet River flows over the highest waterfalls in Northern Ireland.

==Demography==

It is one of four counties in Northern Ireland which currently has a majority of the population from a Catholic community background, according to the 2021 census. At the time of the 2021 census there were 252,231 residents of County Londonderry. Of these: 61.3% were from a Catholic background, 32.5% were from a Protestant and Other Christian (including Christian related), 0.9% were from other religions, and 5.3% had no religious background.


== Administration ==
The county was administered by Londonderry County Council from 1899 until the abolition of county councils in Northern Ireland in 1973. They were replaced by district councils. These councils were: Londonderry City Council (renamed Derry City Council in 1984), Limavady Borough Council, and Magherafelt District Council, most of Coleraine Borough Council, and part of Cookstown District Council. After a reduction in the number of councils in Northern Ireland in 2011, County Londonderry is divided into three cross-county councils: Causeway Coast and Glens, Derry and Strabane, and Mid-Ulster District.

== Transport ==
Translink provides a Northern Ireland Railways service in the county, linking Derry~Londonderry railway station to Coleraine railway station (with a branch to on the Coleraine–Portrush railway line) and onwards into County Antrim to Belfast Lanyon Place and Belfast Grand Central on the Belfast-Derry railway line.

There is also the Foyle Valley Railway, a museum in Derry with some rolling stock from both the County Donegal Railway and the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway, and is located on the site of the former Londonderry Foyle Road railway station. The Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway continued as a private bus company based in the city but operating predominantly in County Donegal until it closed in 2014. Bus services are now provided by Ulsterbus.

== Education ==
Government-funded education up to secondary school level is administered by the Education Authority (EA), sponsored by the Department of Education. The EA is divided into sub-regions:

* Western region: Derry, Limavady;
* North Eastern region: Coleraine, Magherafelt;
* Southern region: Cookstown.

For Catholic grant-maintained schools administration is by the Derry Diocesan Education Office.

Two major centres of the University of Ulster are in the county, including its headquarters at Coleraine and the Magee Campus in Derry.

== Sport ==

In Gaelic games, the GAA county of Derry is more or less coterminous with the former administrative county of Londonderry, although teams from the neighbouring counties of Tyrone, Donegal and Antrim have occasionally played in Derry competitions, and vice versa. The Derry teams wear the colours red and white. There are many club teams competing in up to five leagues and three championships. The county team has won one All-Ireland Senior Football Championship (in 1993) and five National League titles. Hurling is also widely played but is not as popular as football. However, the county team is generally regarded as one of the top hurling sides in Ulster and in 2006 won the Nicky Rackard Cup – the third tier hurling competition in Ireland.

In association football, the NIFL Premiership, which operates as the top division, has two teams in the county: Coleraine F.C. and Institute F.C., with Limavady United F.C., Moyola Park F.C., Portstewart F.C. and Tobermore United F.C. competing in the NIFL Championship, which operates as levels two and three. Derry City F.C. play in the Premier Division of the League of Ireland after leaving the Northern Ireland structures in 1985, having resigned from the Irish Football League at the height of the Troubles because of not being allowed play their home games at the Brandywell due to security concerns from other clubs.

The Northern Ireland Milk Cup was established in 1983 and is regarded as one of the most prestigious youth football tournaments in Europe and the world. The competition is based at Coleraine and involves several other towns and villages in the county – Limavady, Portstewart and Castlerock – and in neighbouring County Antrim – Ballymoney, Portrush, Ballymena and Broughshane. The event, held in the last week of July, has attracted teams from 56 countries around the world including Europe, the US, Africa, the Far East, South America, the Middle East, Australia, Russia, New Zealand and Canada. Some of the biggest teams in the world have entered including Premiership giants Everton, Liverpool, Manchester United, Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur as well as top European teams such as Feyenoord, F.C. Porto, FC Barcelona, Benfica, Bayern Munich and Dynamo Kiev.

In rugby union, the county is represented at senior level by Rainey Old Boys Rugby Club, Magherafelt who compete in the Ulster Senior League and All Ireland Division Three. Limavady R.F.C, City of Derry Rugby Club, Londonderry Y.M.C.A and Coleraine Rugby Club all compete in Ulster Qualifying League One.

Cricket is particularly popular in the north-west of Ireland, with 11 of the 20 senior clubs in the North West Cricket Union located in County Londonderry: Limavady, Eglinton, Glendermott, Brigade, Killymallaght, Ardmore, Coleraine, Bonds Glen, Drummond, Creevedonnell and The Nedd.

In rowing, Richard Archibald from Coleraine along with his Irish teammates qualified for the Beijing 2008 Olympics by finishing second in the lightweight fours final in Poznań, thus qualifying for the Beijing 2008 Olympics. Another Coleraine rower Alan Campbell is a World Cup gold medallist in the single sculls in 2006.

== Media ==
The county currently has four main radio stations:

* BBC Radio Foyle;
* Q102.9;
* Q97.2;
* Six FM (in the south of the county).

<doc id="52820" wikidata="Q220260" url="?curid=52820" title="Resident Evil">
<text>Resident Evil, known as in Japan, is a Japanese horror game series and media franchise created by Capcom. It consists of survival horror, third-person shooter and first-person shooter games, with players typically surviving in environments inhabited by zombies and other mutated creatures. The franchise has expanded into other media, including a live-action film series, animated films, television series, comic books, novels, audiobooks, and merchandise. &quot;Resident Evil&quot; is the highest-grossing horror franchise.

The first &quot;Resident Evil&quot; game was created by Shinji Mikami and Tokuro Fujiwara for PlayStation, and released in 1996. It is credited for defining the survival horror genre and returning zombies to popular culture. With &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot; (2005), the franchise shifted to more dynamic shooting action, popularizing the &quot;over-the-shoulder&quot; third-person view in action-adventure games.

The franchise returned to survival horror with &quot;Resident Evil 7: Biohazard&quot; (2017) and &quot;Resident Evil Village&quot; (2021), which used a first-person perspective. Capcom has also released four &quot;Resident Evil&quot; remakes: &quot;Resident Evil&quot; (2002), &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; (2019), &quot;Resident Evil 3&quot; (2020) and &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot; (2023). &quot;Resident Evil&quot; is Capcom&#x27;s best-selling franchise and the best-selling horror game series, with more than copies sold worldwide as of December 2024.

The first &quot;Resident Evil&quot; film was released in 2002, starring Milla Jovovich, followed by five sequels and a reboot, &quot;Welcome to Raccoon City&quot; (2021). The films received mostly negative reviews, but have grossed more than $1.2 billion, making &quot;Resident Evil&quot; the third-highest-grossing video game film series.

== History ==
The development of the first &quot;Resident Evil&quot;, released as &quot;Biohazard&quot; in Japan, began in 1993 when Capcom&#x27;s Tokuro Fujiwara told Shinji Mikami and other co-workers to create a game using elements from Fujiwara&#x27;s 1989 game &quot;Sweet Home&quot; on the Family Computer (Famicom) in Japan. When in late 1994 marketing executives were setting up to release &quot;Biohazard&quot; in the United States, it was pointed out that securing the rights to the name &quot;Biohazard&quot; would be very difficult as a DOS game had been registered under that name, as well as a New York hardcore punk band called Biohazard. A contest was held among company personnel to choose a new name; this competition turned up &quot;Resident Evil&quot;, the name under which it was released in the west. &quot;Resident Evil&quot; made its debut on the PlayStation in 1996 and was later ported to the Sega Saturn.

The first entry in the series was the first game to be dubbed a &quot;survival horror&quot;, a term coined for the new genre it initiated, and its critical and commercial success led to the production of two sequels, &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; in 1998 and &quot;Resident Evil 3: Nemesis&quot; in 1999, both for the PlayStation. A port of &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; was released for the Nintendo 64. In addition, ports of all three were released for Windows. The fourth game in the series, &quot;Resident Evil – Code: Veronica&quot;, was developed for the Dreamcast and released in 2000, followed by ports of &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; and &quot;Resident Evil 3: Nemesis&quot;. &quot;Resident Evil – Code: Veronica&quot; was later re-released for Dreamcast in Japan in an updated form as &quot;Code: Veronica Complete&quot;, which included slight changes, many of which revolved around story cutscenes. This updated version was later ported to the PlayStation 2 and GameCube as &quot;Code: Veronica X&quot;.

Despite earlier announcements that the next game in the series would be released for the PlayStation 2, which resulted in the creation of an unrelated game, &quot;Devil May Cry&quot;, Mikami decided to make the series exclusively for the GameCube. The next three games in the series—a remake of the original &quot;Resident Evil&quot; and the prequel &quot;Resident Evil Zero&quot;, both released in 2002, as well as &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot; (2005)—were all released initially as GameCube exclusives. &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot; was later released for Windows, PlayStation 2, and Wii.

A trilogy of GunCon-compatible light gun games known as the &quot;Gun Survivor&quot; series featured first-person gameplay. The first, &quot;Resident Evil Survivor&quot;, was released in 2000 for the PlayStation and PC but received mediocre reviews. The subsequent games, &quot;Resident Evil Survivor 2 – Code: Veronica&quot; and &quot;Resident Evil: Dead Aim&quot;, fared somewhat better. &quot;Dead Aim&quot; is the fourth &quot;Gun Survivor&quot; game in Japan, with &quot;Gun Survivor 3&quot; being the &quot;Dino Crisis&quot; spin-off &quot;Dino Stalker&quot;. In a similar vein, the &quot;Chronicles&quot; series features first-person gameplay, albeit on an on-rails path. &quot;Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles&quot; was released in 2007 for the Wii, with a sequel, &quot;Resident Evil: The Darkside Chronicles&quot; released in 2009 (both were later ported to the PlayStation 3 in 2012).

&quot;Resident Evil Outbreak&quot; is an online game for the PlayStation 2, released in 2003, depicting a series of episodic storylines in Raccoon City set during the same period as &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; and &quot;Resident Evil 3: Nemesis&quot;. It was the first in the series and the first survival horror game to feature cooperative gameplay. It was followed by a sequel, &quot;Resident Evil Outbreak: File #2&quot;. Raccoon City is a metropolis located in the Arklay Mountains of the Midwestern United States that succumbed to the deadly T-virus outbreak and was consequently destroyed via a nuclear missile attack issued by the United States government. The town served as a critical junction for the series&#x27; progression as one of the main catalysts to Umbrella&#x27;s downfall and the entry point for some of the series&#x27; most notable characters.
&quot;Resident Evil Gaiden&quot; is an action-adventure game for the Game Boy Color featuring a role-playing-style combat system. There have been several downloadable mobile games based on the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; series in Japan. Some of these mobile games have been released in North America and Europe through T-Mobile. At the Sony press conference during E3 2009, &quot;Resident Evil Portable&quot; was announced for the PlayStation Portable, described as a new game being developed with &quot;the PSP Go in mind&quot; and &quot;totally different for a &quot;Resident Evil&quot; game&quot;. No further announcements have been made, and the game is considered to have been canceled.

In 2009, &quot;Resident Evil 5&quot; was released for PlayStation 3, Windows and Xbox 360, becoming the best selling game of the franchise despite mixed fan reception. Capcom revealed the third-person shooter &quot;Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City&quot;, which was developed by Slant Six Games for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Windows and released in March 2012. A survival horror game for the Nintendo 3DS, &quot;Resident Evil: Revelations&quot;, was released in February 2012. In October of the same year, the next numbered entry in the main series, &quot;Resident Evil 6&quot;, was released to mixed reviews, but enthusiastic pre-order sales.

In 2013, producer Masachika Kawata said the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; franchise would return to focus on elements of horror and suspense over action, adding that &quot;survival horror as a genre is never going to be on the same level, financially, as shooters and much more popular, mainstream games. At the same time, I think we need to have the confidence to put money behind these projects, and it doesn&#x27;t mean we can&#x27;t focus on what we need to do as a survival horror game to meet fan&#x27;s needs.&quot; &quot;Resident Evil: Revelations 2&quot;, an episodic game set between &quot;Resident Evil 5&quot; and &quot;Resident Evil 6&quot;, was released in March 2015. A series of team-based multiplayer games were developed beginning with the poorly received &quot;Umbrella Corps&quot;, which was released in June 2016. &quot;Resident Evil: Resistance&quot; was released in April 2020, followed by &quot;Resident Evil Re:Verse&quot; in October 2022, with both being available for free to those who bought &quot;Resident Evil 3&quot; and &quot;Village&quot; respectively.

Using the new RE Engine, which would develop the next generation of &quot;Resident Evil&quot; games, the series continued to shift back towards more horror elements. The next mainline game, &quot;Resident Evil 7: Biohazard&quot; was released for Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in January 2017. Set in a dilapidated mansion in Louisiana, the game uses a first-person perspective and emphasizes horror and exploration over action, unlike previous installments. The first-person perspective continued in the eighth mainline game &quot;Resident Evil Village.&quot; Released in May 2021, the game, set in a mysterious European village, is a direct sequel to &quot;Resident Evil 7: Biohazard&quot; although it incorporates more action elements inspired from &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot;. The game also marked the franchise&#x27;s debut on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S

A new generation of remakes of older entries began in 2019 with a remake of &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot;, being released for the PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One. The remake outsold the original game within a year, selling over five million copies. Following in the success of the &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; remake, Capcom revealed a remake of &quot;Resident Evil 3: Nemesis&quot; in December 2019, known as &quot;Resident Evil 3&quot;. It was released in April 2020. In June 2022, a remake of &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot; was announced, and released on March 24, 2023, for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

== Story overview ==

The early &quot;Resident Evil&quot; games focused on the Umbrella Corporation, an international pharmaceutical company that secretly develops mutagenic viruses to further their &quot;bio-organic weapons&quot; (BOW) research. The company&#x27;s viruses can transform humans into mindless zombies while also mutating plants and animals into horrifying monstrosities. The Umbrella Corporation uses its vast resources to effectively control Raccoon City, a fictional midwestern American city. In the original &quot;Resident Evil&quot;, members of an elite police task force, Special Tactics and Rescue Service (STARS), are lured to a derelict mansion on the outskirts of Raccoon City. The STARS team is mostly decimated by zombies and other BOWs, leaving only a handful of survivors, including Chris Redfield, Jill Valentine, and Albert Wesker. Chris and Jill explore the zombie-infested mansion and uncover a secret underground Umbrella research facility. Wesker reveals himself to be a double agent for Umbrella and betrays his comrades. However, Wesker is seemingly murdered by a Tyrant, a special BOW that is the culmination of the Umbrella Corporation&#x27;s research.

Chris and Jill escape the mansion, but their testimony is ridiculed by Raccoon City&#x27;s officials due to Umbrella&#x27;s influence. Meanwhile, a separate viral outbreak occurs in another Umbrella research facility underneath Raccoon City. Most of the city&#x27;s residents are infected and become zombies. &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; introduces two new protagonists, Leon S. Kennedy, a rookie police officer and Claire Redfield, the younger sister of Chris. Leon and Claire arrive in Raccoon City amidst the chaos of the viral outbreak. Leon is aided by Ada Wong, a corporate spy posing as an FBI agent, while Claire rescues Sherry Birkin, the daughter of two prominent Umbrella researchers. At the same time, Jill makes her escape from the city in &quot;Resident Evil 3: Nemesis&quot;. She is relentlessly pursued by a new Tyrant, Nemesis, who is deployed by Umbrella to eliminate all surviving STARS members. The U.S. Government destroys Raccoon City with a missile strike to sterilize the viral outbreak. Leon, Claire, Sherry, Ada, and Jill escape the city before its eradication. Claire continues to look for Chris, whereas Leon is recruited to work for the U.S. Government. &quot;Resident Evil – Code: Veronica&quot; follows Claire as she escapes from a prison camp in the Southern Ocean and later reunites with Chris at an Umbrella research facility in Antarctica. &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot; is set six years after the Raccoon City incident and focuses on Leon as he tries to rescue the U.S. President&#x27;s daughter from a cult in Spain.

A government investigation into the Umbrella Corporation reveals its involvement in the Raccoon City disaster and leads to the company&#x27;s dissolution. Despite the downfall of the Umbrella Corporation, the company&#x27;s research and BOWs proliferate across the black market and lead to the rise of bioterrorism. Chris and Jill establish the Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance (BSAA) to combat these ever-growing threats on a global scale. Wesker is revealed to be alive and involved in the development of new potent viral agents and BOWs. In &quot;Resident Evil 5&quot;, Wesker seeks to unleash a highly mutagenic virus that will infect all of humanity. Chris and the BSAA confront and kill Wesker in Africa before he can fulfill his mission. &quot;Resident Evil 6&quot; features Leon and Chris meeting for the first time in the video game series. The two work separately to triage bioterrorist attacks in the United States, Eastern Europe, and China. They are assisted by Sherry, Wesker&#x27;s illegitimate son Jake Muller, Ada, and many members of the BSAA and U.S. government.

&quot;Resident Evil 7: Biohazard&quot; and &quot;Resident Evil Village&quot; introduce a new protagonist, Ethan Winters, who becomes entangled in a bioterrorism incident while searching for his missing wife. He encounters Chris and the BSAA, who help him rescue his wife and defeat Eveline, a powerful BOW. Ethan, Mia, and their newborn daughter, Rosemary, are relocated to Eastern Europe but are abducted by a cult. Ethan ultimately sacrifices himself to destroy a fungal colony being weaponized by bioterrorists and save his family.

==Gameplay==
The &quot;Resident Evil&quot; franchise has had a variety of control schemes and gameplay mechanics throughout its history. Puzzle-solving has figured prominently throughout the series.

===Tank controls===
The first game introduced a control scheme that the player community has come to refer to as &quot;tank controls&quot; to the series. In a game with tank controls, players control movement relative to the position of the player character, rather than relative to the fixed virtual camera from which the player views the current scene. Pressing up (for example on a D-pad, analog stick, or cursor movement keys) on the game controller moves the character in the direction being faced, pressing down backpedals, and left and right rotates the character. This can feel counter-intuitive when the character is facing the camera, as the controls are essentially reversed in this state. This differs from many 3D games, in which characters move in the direction the player pushes the controls from the perspective of the camera. Some critics have posited that the control scheme is intentionally clumsy, meant to enhance stress and exacerbate difficulty.

While the first three entries in the series featured this control scheme, the third, &quot;Resident Evil 3: Nemesis&quot;, saw some action-oriented additions. These included a 180 degree turn and dodge command that, according to &quot;GameSpot&quot;, &quot;hinted at a new direction that the series would go in.&quot; Later games in the series, like &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot;, would feature a more fluid over-the-shoulder third-person camera instead of a fixed camera for each room, while &quot;Resident Evil 7&quot; and &quot;Resident Evil Village&quot; are played from the first-person perspective.

===Third-person shooter gameplay===
&quot;Resident Evil 4&quot; saw significant changes to the established gameplay, including switching from fixed camera perspectives to a tracking camera, and more action-oriented gameplay and mechanics. This was complemented by an abundance of ammunition and revised aiming and melee mechanics. Some critics claimed that this overhauled control scheme &quot;made the game less scary.&quot; The next two games in the franchise furthered the action-oriented mechanics: &quot;Resident Evil 5&quot; featured cooperative play and added strafing, while &quot;Resident Evil 6&quot; allowed players to move while aiming and shooting for the first time, fully abandoning the series&#x27; signature tank controls.

===First-person shooter gameplay and VR===
&quot;Resident Evil 7&quot; is the first main &quot;Resident Evil&quot; game to use the first-person perspective and to use virtual reality. It drew comparisons to modern survival horror games such as &quot;Outlast&quot; and &quot;PT&quot;. The eighth main-series game, &quot;Resident Evil Village&quot;, also features a first-person perspective. A VR version of &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot; was released on the Oculus Quest 2 on October 21, 2021.

== Other media ==
The &quot;Resident Evil&quot; franchise features video games and tie-in merchandise and products, including various live-action and animated films, comic books, and novels.

=== Films ===
==== Live-action films ====
From 2002 to 2016, six live-action &quot;Resident Evil&quot; films were produced, all written and produced by Paul W. S. Anderson. The films do not follow the games&#x27; premise but feature some game characters. The series&#x27; protagonist is Alice, an original character created for the films portrayed by Milla Jovovich. Despite a negative reaction from critics, the live-action film series has made over $1 billion worldwide. They are, to date, the only video game adaptations to increase the amount of money made with each successive film. The series holds the record for the &quot;Most Live-Action Film Adaptations of a Video Game&quot; in the 2012 &quot;Guinness World Records Gamer&#x27;s Edition&quot;, which also described it as &quot;the most successful movie series to be based on a video game.&quot;

A reboot, &quot;Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City,&quot; was released on November 24, 2021, with Johannes Roberts as writer/director.

==== Animated films ====

The first computer animated film for the franchise was &quot;Biohazard 4D-Executer&quot;. It was a short 3D film produced for Japanese theme parks and did not feature any characters from the game.

Starting in 2008, a series of feature-length computer-animated films have been released. These films take place in the same continuity with the games of the series, and feature characters such as Leon Kennedy, Claire Redfield, Ada Wong, Chris Redfield, Jill Valentine and Rebecca Chambers.

=== Television ===
&quot;Resident Evil: Infinite Darkness&quot;, a four-part CG anime series, premiered on July 8, 2021, on Netflix. Starring the &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; protagonists Leon S. Kennedy and Claire Redfield, the series features both uncovering a worldwide plot. The series released on July 8, 2021 on Netflix.

=== Merchandise ===

Over the years, various toy companies have acquired the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; license, with each producing their own unique line of &quot;Resident Evil&quot; action figures or models. These include, but are not limited to, Toy Biz, Palisades Toys, NECA, and Hot Toys.

Tokyo Marui also produced replicas of the guns used in the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; series in the form of gas blow-back airsoft guns. Some models included the STARS Beretta featured in &quot;Resident Evil 3&quot;, and the Desert Eagle in a limited edition that came with other memorabilia in a wooden case, along with the Gold Lugers from &quot;Code: Veronica&quot; and the &quot;Samurai Edge&quot; pistol from the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; remake. Other merchandise includes an energy drink called &quot;T-virus Antidote&quot;.

&quot;Resident Evil Archives&quot; is a reference guide of the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; series written by staff members of Capcom. It was translated into English and published by BradyGames. The guide describes and summarizes all of the key events that occur in &quot;Resident Evil Zero&quot;, &quot;Resident Evil&quot;, &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot;, &quot;Resident Evil 3: Nemesis&quot;, and &quot;Code: Veronica&quot;. The main plot analysis also contains character relationship charts, artwork, item descriptions, and file transcripts for all five games. A second Archives book was later released in December 2011 and covers &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot;, &quot;Resident Evil 5&quot;, the new scenarios detailed in &quot;Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles&quot; and &quot;Resident Evil: The Darkside Chronicles&quot;, and the 2008 CGI movie, &quot;Resident Evil: Degeneration&quot;. The second Archives volume was also translated by Capcom and published by BradyGames.

A &quot;Resident Evil&quot; theme restaurant called Biohazard Cafe &amp; Grill S.T.A.R.S. opened in Tokyo in 2012. Halloween Horror Nights 2013, held at Universal Orlando, featured a haunted house titled &quot;Resident Evil: Escape from Raccoon City&quot;, based on &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; and &quot;Resident Evil 3: Nemesis&quot;.

=== Novels ===
The first &quot;Resident Evil&quot; novel was Hiroyuki Ariga&#x27;s novella &quot;Biohazard: The Beginning&quot;, published in 1997 as a portion of the book &quot;The True Story of Biohazard&quot;, which was given away as a pre-order bonus with the Sega Saturn version of &quot;Biohazard&quot;. The story serves as a prelude to the original &quot;Resident Evil&quot;, in which Chris investigates the disappearance of his missing friend, Billy Rabbitson.

S. D. Perry has written novelizations of the first five games, as well as two original novels taking place between games. The novels often take liberties with the games&#x27; plot by exploring events occurring outside and beyond the games. This often meant that the games would later contradict the books on a few occasions. One notable addition from the novels is the original character Trent, who often served as a mysterious behind-the-scenes string-puller who aided the main characters. Perry&#x27;s novels were translated and released in Japan with new cover arts by Wolfina. Perry&#x27;s novels, particularly &quot;The Umbrella Conspiracy&quot;, also alluded to events in &quot;Biohazard: The Beginning&quot;, such as the disappearance of Billy Rabbitson and Brian Irons&#x27; bid to run for Mayor. A reprinting of Perry&#x27;s novels with new cover artwork began in 2012 to coincide with the release of &quot;Resident Evil: Retribution&quot; and its respective novelization.

There are a trilogy of original &quot;Biohazard&quot; novels in Japan. was published in 1998 and was written by Kyū Asakura and the staff of Flagship. Two additional novels were published in 2002, &quot;To the Liberty&quot; by Sudan Kimura and &quot;Rose Blank&quot; by Tadashi Aizawa. While no official English translation of these novels has been published yet, the last two books were translated into German and published in 2006.

Novelizations of the films &quot;Genesis&quot;, &quot;Apocalypse&quot;, and &quot;Extinction&quot; were written by Keith DeCandido. &quot;Afterlife&quot; did not receive a novelization due to Capcom&#x27;s decision to discontinue working with Pocket Books, who had been their primary source of publishing books up to that point, Capcom would later make Titan Books their primary publisher going forth. &quot;Retribution&quot; was written by John Shirley, while &quot;The Final Chapter&quot; was written by Tim Waggoner. &quot;Genesis&quot; was published over two years after that film&#x27;s release and coincided with the publication of &quot;Apocalypse&quot;, &quot;Genesis&quot; being marketed as a prequel to &quot;Apocalypse&quot;, while the &quot;Extinction&quot; novel was released in late July 2007, two months before the film&#x27;s release. &quot;The Final Chapter&quot; was published in December 2016 alongside the film&#x27;s theatrical release. There was also a Japanese novelization of the first film, unrelated to DeCandido&#x27;s version, written by Osamu Makino. Makino also wrote two novels based on the game &quot;Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles&quot;. The books are a two-part direct novelization of the game and are published in Japanese and German only. The first novel, titled &quot;Biohazard: The Umbrella Chronicles Side A&quot; in Japan and &quot;Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles 1&quot; in Germany, was released on December 22, 2007. The second novel, titled &quot;Biohazard: The Umbrella Chronicles Side B&quot; in Japan and &quot;Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles 2&quot; in Germany, was published in January 2008.

=== Comics ===
In 1997, Marvel Comics published a single-issue prologue comic based on the original &quot;Resident Evil&quot;, released through a promotional giveaway alongside the original PlayStation game.

In 1998, WildStorm began producing a monthly comic book series based on the first two games, &quot;Resident Evil: The Official Comic Magazine&quot;, which lasted five issues. The first four issues were published by Image, while Wildstorm themselves published the fifth and final issue. Each issue was a compilation of short stories that were both adaptations of events from the games and related side stories. Like the Perry novels, the comics also explored events occurring beyond &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; (the latest game during the series&#x27; publication) and thus were contradicted by later games. Wildstorm also published a four-issue miniseries, &quot;Resident Evil: Fire &amp; Ice&quot;, which depicted the ordeal of Charlie Team, a third STARS team created specifically for the comic. In 2009, Wildstorm reprinted &quot;Fire &amp; Ice&quot; in a trade paperback collection.

In Hong Kong, there has been officially licensed &quot;Biohazard&quot; manhua adaptations of &quot;Biohazard 0&quot; by publisher Yulang Group, &quot;Biohazard 2&quot; by Kings Fountain, &quot;Biohazard 3 Supplemental Edition&quot; by Cao Zhihao and, &quot;Biohazard 3 The Last Escape&quot;, and &quot;Biohazard Code: Veronica&quot; by Lee Chung Hing published by Tinhangse Publishing. The Code: Veronica manhua was translated into English, formatted to look like an American comic and distributed by WildStorm as a series of four graphic novel collections.

In 2009, Wildstorm began publishing a &quot;Resident Evil&quot; comic book prequel to &quot;Resident Evil 5&quot;, which centers on two original members of the BSAA, Mina Gere and Holiday Sugarman. Written by Ricardo Sanchez and illustrated by Kevin Sharpe and Jim Clark, the first issue was published on March 11, 2009. On November 11, 2009, the third issue was released, and the fourth was released March 24, 2010. The sixth and final book was finally published in February 2011.

=== Plays ===
In the summer of 2000, &quot;Bioroid: Year Zero&quot; was performed in Japan. It was a musical horror-comedy but took the perspective of the infected. Super Eccentric Theater put on the production under the direction of Osamu Yagihashi. The stage play was performed from early July to late August.

&quot;Biohazard The Stage&quot; was released in Japan in 2015. The play focused on iconic characters, Chris Redfield and Rebecca Chambers, as Philosophy University in Australia is experiencing a bioterrorist attack. The production was handled by Avex Live Creative and Ace Crew Entertainment, under supervision from Capcom.

The following year, &quot;Musical Biohazard ~Voice of Gaia~&quot; was released in September. It was produced by Umeda Arts Theater by director G2 and composer, Shunsuke Wada.

&quot;Biohazard the Experience&quot; was the second &quot;Resident Evil&quot; play produced by Avex Live Creative and Ace Crew Entertainment. The story is set in 2015 and follows a cast of thirteen survivors who were abducted and woke up in a mansion during an outbreak.

== Reception and legacy ==
Most of the games in the prominent &quot;Resident Evil&quot; series have been released to positive reviews.

The success of the video games and films have made &quot;Resident Evil&quot; the highest-grossing franchise in the horror and zombie genres.

===Cultural impact===
&quot;GameSpot&quot; listed the original &quot;Resident Evil&quot; as one of the fifteen most influential video games of all time. It is credited with defining and popularizing the survival horror genre of games. It is also credited with taking video games in a cinematic direction with its B-movie style cut-scenes, including live-action full-motion video (FMV) footage. Its live-action opening, however, was controversial; it became one of the first action games to receive the &quot;Mature 17+&quot; (M) rating from the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB), despite the opening cutscene being censored in North America.

The &quot;Resident Evil&quot; franchise is credited with sparking a revival of the zombie genre in popular culture, leading to a renewed interest in zombie films during the 2000s. &quot;Resident Evil&quot; also helped redefine the zombie genre, playing an important role in its shift from supernatural themes to scientific themes by using science to explain the origins of zombies. According to Kim Newman in the book &quot;Nightmare Movies&quot; (2011), &quot;the zombie revival began in the Far East&quot; mainly due to the 1996 Japanese zombie games &quot;Resident Evil&quot; and &quot;The House of the Dead&quot;. George A. Romero, in 2013, said it was the video games &quot;Resident Evil&quot; and &quot;House of the Dead&quot; &quot;more than anything else&quot; that popularised his zombie concept in early 21st-century popular culture. In a 2015 interview with &quot;Huffington Post&quot;, screenwriter-director Alex Garland credited the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; series as a primary influence on his script for the horror film &quot;28 Days Later&quot; (2002), and credited the first &quot;Resident Evil&quot; game for revitalizing the zombie genre. Screenwriter Edgar Wright cited &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; as a primary influence on his zombie comedy film &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; (2004), with the film&#x27;s star and co-writer Simon Pegg also crediting the first game with starting the zombie revival in popular culture. &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; comic book creator Robert Kirkman cited &quot;Resident Evil&quot; as his favorite zombie game, while &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; television series director Greg Nicotero credited &quot;Resident Evil&quot; and &quot;The House of the Dead&quot; with introducing the zombie genre &quot;to a whole generation of younger people who didn&#x27;t grow up watching &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; and &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot;.&quot;

The &quot;Resident Evil Apocalypse&quot; zombies were conceptualized and choreographed by Sharon B. Moore and Derek Aasland. Through script analysis and movement research a &quot;scientific logic&quot; was devised for the T-virus accounting for each Zombie behaviour envisioned in Paul W. S. Anderson&#x27;s script. Sharon B. Moore and Derek Aasland then wrote the so-called Undead Bible - a Handbook for the Undead - used as the guide for the nearly 1000 cast under the choreographic department (stunt performers, actors, dancers, extras) to ensure the Undead physicality was performed in a unified way across the picture.  The Stunt and Core teams participated in the &quot;Undead Bootcamp&quot;.  See also 2007 Documentary &quot;Undead Bootcamp&quot; starring producer Jeremy Bolt, director Alexander Witt, and choreographers Sharon B. Moore and Derek Aasland.

On the DVD Featurette ″&quot;Resident Evil; Game Over&quot;″ &quot;Apocalypse&quot; director Alexander Witt said the zombies needed to be &quot;more aggressive and more dangerous&quot; than the original film, so they were created by the film&#x27;s choreographers Sharon B. Moore and Derek Aasland as &quot;liquid zombie[s]&#x27; in terms of their relentless forward motion: unstoppable, flowing around any kind of resistance, and then rushing in on the final attack. This is also detailed in the University of Liverpool book Biopunk Dystopias Genetic Engineering, Society, and Science Fiction (Lars Schmeink, 2016, p. 214). 

Additionally, the first &quot;Resident Evil&quot; film adaptation also contributed to the revival of zombie films, with the success of the film and the games resulting in zombies achieving greater mainstream prominence and several zombie films being greenlit, such as the video game film adaptation &quot;House of the Dead&quot; (2003), the remake &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; (2004) and Romero&#x27;s &quot;Land of the Dead&quot; (2005). The &quot;Resident Evil&quot; films, &quot;28 Days Later&quot; and the &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; remake all set box office records for the zombie genre, reaching levels of commercial success not seen since the original &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; (1978). They were followed by other zombie films such as &quot;28 Weeks Later&quot; (2007), &quot;Zombieland&quot; (2009), &quot;Cockneys vs Zombies&quot; (2012), and &quot;World War Z&quot; (2013), as well as zombie-themed graphic novels and television shows such as &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; and &quot;The Returned&quot;, and books such as &quot;World War Z&quot; (2006), &quot;Pride and Prejudice and Zombies&quot; (2009) and &quot;Warm Bodies&quot; (2010). The zombie revival trend was popular across different media up until the mid-2010s. Since then, zombie films have declined in popularity during the late 2010s, but zombie video games have remained popular, as seen with the commercial success of the &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; remake and &quot;Days Gone&quot; in 2019.

<text>County Tyrone (; ) is one of the six counties of Northern Ireland, one of the nine counties of Ulster and one of the thirty-two traditional counties of Ireland. Its county town is Omagh.

Adjoined to the south-west shore of Lough Neagh, the county covers an area of , making it the largest of Northern Ireland&#x27;s six counties by size, and the second largest county in Ulster after Donegal. With a population of 188,383 as of the 2021 census, Tyrone is the 5th most populous county in both Northern Ireland and Ulster, and the 11th most populous county on the island of Ireland. The county derives its name and general geographic location from Tír Eoghain, a Gaelic kingdom under the O&#x27;Neill dynasty which existed until the 17th century.

==Name==
The name &quot;Tyrone&quot; is derived , the name given to the conquests made by the Cenél nEógain from the provinces of Airgíalla and Ulaid. Historically, it was anglicised as &quot;Tirowen&quot; or &quot;Tyrowen&quot;, which are closer to the Irish pronunciation.

==History==

Historically Tyrone (then Tír Eoghain or Tirowen) was much larger in size, stretching as far north as Lough Foyle, and comprised part of modern-day County Londonderry east of the River Foyle. The majority of County Londonderry was carved out of Tyrone between 1610 and 1620 when that land went to the Guilds of London to set up profit making schemes based on natural resources located there. Tyrone was the traditional stronghold of the various O&#x27;Neill clans and families, the strongest of the Gaelic Irish families in Ulster, surviving into the seventeenth century. The ancient principality of Tír Eoghain, the inheritance of the O&#x27;Neills, included the whole of the present counties of Tyrone and Londonderry, and the four baronies of West Inishowen, East Inishowen, Raphoe North and Raphoe South in County Donegal.

In 1608 during O&#x27;Doherty&#x27;s Rebellion areas of the country were plundered and burnt by the forces of Sir Cahir O&#x27;Doherty following his destruction of Derry. However, O&#x27;Doherty&#x27;s men avoided the estates of the recently fled Earl of Tyrone around Dungannon, fearing Tyrone&#x27;s anger if he returned from his exile.

==Geography==
With an area of , Tyrone is the largest county in Northern Ireland. The flat peatlands of East Tyrone border the shoreline of the largest lake in the British Isles, Lough Neagh, rising gradually across to the more mountainous terrain in the west of the county, the area surrounding the Sperrin Mountains, the highest point being Sawel Mountain at a height of . The length of the county, from the mouth of the River Blackwater at Lough Neagh to the western point near Carrickaduff hill is . The breadth, from the southern corner, southeast of Fivemiletown, to the northeastern corner near Meenard Mountain is ; giving an area of . Annaghone lays claim to be the geographical centre of Northern Ireland.

Tyrone is connected by land to the counties of Fermanagh to the southwest; Monaghan to the south; Armagh to the southeast; Londonderry to the north; and Donegal to the west. Across Lough Neagh to the east, it borders County Antrim. It is the eighth largest of Ireland&#x27;s thirty-two counties by area and tenth largest by population. It is the second largest of Ulster&#x27;s nine traditional counties by area and fourth largest by population.
