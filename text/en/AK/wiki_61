<doc id="55289" wikidata="Q1533" url="?curid=55289" title="Caracas">
<text>Caracas ( , ), officially Santiago de León de Caracas (CCS), is the capital and largest city of Venezuela, and the center of the Metropolitan Region of Caracas (or Greater Caracas). Caracas is located along the Guaire River in the northern part of the country, within the Caracas Valley of the Venezuelan coastal mountain range (Cordillera de la Costa). The valley is close to the Caribbean Sea, separated from the coast by a steep mountain range, Cerro El Ávila; to the south there are more hills and mountains. The Metropolitan Region of Caracas has an estimated population of almost 5 million inhabitants.

The historic center of the city is the Cathedral, located on Bolívar Square, though some consider the center to be Plaza Venezuela, located in the Los Caobos area. Businesses in the city include service companies, banks, and malls. Caracas has a largely service-based economy, apart from some industrial activity in its metropolitan area. The Caracas Stock Exchange and Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) are headquartered in Caracas. Empresas Polar is the largest private company in Venezuela. Caracas is also Venezuela&#x27;s cultural capital, with many restaurants, theaters, museums, and shopping centers. Caracas has some of the tallest skyscrapers in Latin America, such as the Parque Central Towers. The Museum of Contemporary Art of Caracas is one of the most important in South America.

== History ==
Before the city was founded in 1567, the valley of Caracas was populated by indigenous peoples. Francisco Fajardo, the son of a Spanish captain and a Guaiqueri &quot;cacica&quot;, who came from Margarita, began establishing settlements in the area of La Guaira and the Caracas valley between 1555 and 1560. Fajardo attempted to establish a plantation in the valley in 1562 after these unsuccessful coastal towns, but it did not last long: it was destroyed by natives of the region led by Terepaima and Guaicaipuro. Fajardo&#x27;s 1560 settlement was known as Hato de San Francisco, and another attempt in 1561 by Juan Rodríguez de Suárez was called Villa de San Francisco, and was also destroyed by the same native people. The eventual settlers of Caracas came from Coro, the German capital of their Klein-Venedig colony around the present-day coastal Colombia–Venezuela border; from the 1540s, the colony had been &quot;de facto&quot; controlled by Spaniards. Moving eastward from Coro, groups of Spanish settlers founded inland towns including Barquisimeto and Valencia before reaching the Caracas valley.

On 25 July 1567, Captain Diego de Losada laid the foundations of the city of &quot;Santiago de León de Caracas&quot;. De Losada had been commissioned to capture the valley, and was successful by splitting the natives into different groups to work with, then fighting and defeating each of them. The town was the closest to the coast of these new settlements, and the colonists retained a native workforce, which allowed a trade network to develop between Caracas, the interior, and Margarita; the towns further inland produced ample cotton products and beeswax, and Margarita was a rich source of pearls. The Caracas valley had a good environment for both agricultural and arable farming, which contributed to the system of commerce but meant that the town&#x27;s population was initially sparse, as it was only large enough to support a few farms.

In 1577, Caracas became the capital of the Spanish Empire&#x27;s Venezuela Province under the province&#x27;s new governor, Juan de Pimentel (1576–1583). In the 1580s, Caraqueños started selling food to the Spanish soldiers in Cartagena, who often docked in the coastal city when collecting products from the empire in South America. Wheat was growing increasingly expensive in the Iberian Peninsula, and the Spanish profited from buying it from Caracas farmers. This cemented the city in the empire&#x27;s trade circuit.

During the 16th and 17th centuries, the coast of Venezuela was frequently raided by pirates. With the coastal mountains of the Central Range as a barrier, Caracas was relatively immune to such attacks, compared to other Caribbean coastal settlements, but in 1595 the Preston–Somers expedition landed and around 200 English Privateers, including George Somers and Amyas Preston, crossed the mountains through a little-used pass while the town&#x27;s defenders were guarding the more frequently used one. Encountering little resistance, the invaders sacked and set fire to the town after a failed ransom negotiation. The city managed to rebuild, using wheat profits and &quot;a lot of sacrifice&quot;. In the 1620s, farmers in Caracas discovered that Cacao beans could be sold, first selling them to native people of Mexico and quickly growing across the Caribbean. The city became important in the Viceroyalty of New Spain, as well as moving from largely native slave labor to African slaves, the first of the Spanish colonies to become part of the slave trade. The city was successful and operated on cacao and slave trade until the 1650s, when an &quot;alhorra&quot; blight, the Mexican Inquisition of many of their Portuguese traders, and increased cacao production in Guayaquil greatly affected the market. This and the destructive 1641 earthquake put the city into decline, and they likely began illegally trading with the Dutch Empire, which Caraqueños later proved sympathetic to; by the 1670s, Caracas had a trading route through Curaçao.
In 1728, the Guipuzcoan Company of Caracas was founded by the king, and the cacao business grew in importance. Caracas was made one of the three provinces of Nueva Granada, corresponding to Venezuela, in 1739. Over the next three decades the Viceroyalty was variously split, with Caracas province becoming the Venezuela province. Luis de Unzaga created the Captaincy General of Venezuela in the summer of 1777, with Caracas as the capital. Venezuela then attempted to become independent, first with the 1797 Gual and España conspiracy, based in Caracas, and then the successful 1811 Venezuelan Declaration of Independence. Caracas then came under worse luck: in 1812, an earthquake destroyed Caracas, a quarter of its population migrated in 1814, and the Venezuelan War of Independence continued until 24 June 1821, when Simón Bolívar defeated royalists in the Battle of Carabobo. Urban reforms only took place towards the end of the 19th century, under Antonio Guzmán Blanco: some landmarks were built, but the city remained distinctly colonial until the 1930s.
Caracas grew in size, population, and economic importance during Venezuela&#x27;s oil boom in the early 20th century. In the 1950s, the metropolitan area of Gran Caracas was developed, and the city began an intensive modernization program, funding public buildings, which continued throughout the 1960s and early 1970s. Cultural landmarks, like the University City of Caracas, designed by modernist architect Carlos Raúl Villanueva and declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2000; the Caracas Museum of Contemporary Art; and the Teresa Carreño Cultural Complex were built, as well as the Caracas Metro and a developed downtown area. Urban development was rapid, leading to the growth of slums on the hillsides surrounding the new city. Much of the city development also fell into disrepair come the end of the 20th century, with the 1980s oil glut and political instability like the Caracazo, meaning maintenance can not be sustained. The economic and social problems persist throughout the capital and country, characterized as the Crisis in Venezuela. By 2017, Caracas was the most violent city in the world.

== Coat of arms ==

The coat of arms was adopted in 1591. Simón de Bolívar, an ancestor of Venezuelan liberator Simón Bolívar, had been named the first procurator general of the Venezuelan province in 1589. He served as the representative of Venezuela to the Spanish Crown, and vice versa. In 1591, de Bolívar introduced a petition to King Philip II for a coat of arms, which he granted by Royal Cedula on 4 September that year in San Lorenzo. The coat of arms represents the city&#x27;s name with the red Santiago (St. James&#x27;) cross. It originally depicted &quot;a brown bear rampant on a field of silver, holding between its paws a golden shell with the red cross of Santiago; and its seal is a crown with five golden points&quot;. In the same act, the king declared Caracas as &quot;The Most Noble and Very Loyal City of Santiago de León de Caracas&quot;.

The anthem of the city is the &quot;Marcha a Caracas&quot;, written by the composer Tiero Pezzuti de Matteis with the lyrics by José Enrique Sarabia and approved in 1984.

== Geography ==

Caracas is contained entirely within a valley of the Venezuelan Central Range, and is separated from the Caribbean coast by a roughly expanse of El Ávila National Park. The valley is relatively small and quite irregular, and the altitude varies from between above sea level; the historic center lies at about above sea level. This, along with the rapid population growth, has profoundly influenced the urban development of the city. The most elevated point of the Capital District, wherein the city is located, is the &quot;Pico El Ávila&quot;, which rises to .

The main body of water in Caracas is the Guaire River, which flows across the city and empties into the Tuy River, which is also fed by the El Valle and San Pedro rivers, in addition to numerous streams which descend from El Ávila. The La Mariposa and reservoirs provide water to the city. The city is occasionally subject to earthquakes – notably in 1641 and 1967.

Geologically, Caracas was formed in the Late Cretaceous period, with much of the rest of the Caribbean, and sits on what is mostly metamorphic rock. Deformation of the land in this period formed the region.

=== Climate ===
Under the Köppen climate classification, Caracas has a tropical savanna climate (&quot;Aw&quot;), but also exhibits traits of a subtropical highland climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;) due to its elevated location within the Venezuelan Coastal Range (Maritime Andes). Caracas precipitation varies between (annual), in the city proper to in some parts of the Mountain range. While Caracas is within the tropics, due to its altitude temperatures are cooler compared to other locations with a typical tropical savanna climate. The annual average temperature is approximately , with the average of the coldest month (January) and the average of the warmest month (May) , which gives a small annual thermal amplitude of .

In the months of December and January abundant fog may appear, in addition to a sudden nightly drop in temperature, until reaching . This peculiar weather is known by the natives of Caracas as the &quot;Pacheco&quot;. In addition, nightly temperatures at any time of the year are much (7 to 11 °C) lower than daytime highs and usually do not remain above , resulting in very pleasant evening temperatures. Hailstorms appear in Caracas, although only on rare occasions. Electrical storms are much more frequent, especially between June and October, due to the city being in a closed valley and the orographic action of Cerro El Ávila.

=== Hydrography ===

The hydrographic network of the city of Caracas is made up of the Guaire river basin which is a sub-basin of the Tuy river. This basin crosses the valley where the city is located from West to East (Las Adjuntas – Petare). It covers about 655 square kilometers, about 45 km. long and about 15 km. wide, has a rectangular shape. The basin is formed by the Caracas Valley, which is relatively high, narrow and long, surrounded by the high and steep Cordillera de la Costa, which runs parallel to the Litoral.

Among the characteristics of the hydrographic network associated with the city of Caracas is the high degree of contamination present in the lower parts of the Guaire River due to its tributaries having been used for sewage collection since 1874, during the government of Antonio Guzmán Blanco, until today. The level of contamination is such that it does not allow the maintenance of the life of the species that once populated the basin, and it has become extinct or has been restricted to the highest areas of the basin, mainly within the boundaries of the national park. Avila. Awareness for the recovery of the basin has recently begun, however, much remains to be done before results can be observed.

Among the main rivers and streams that make up the basin are in its northern slope: San Pedro River, Macarao River, Quebrada Caroata, Catuche River, Anauco River, Chacaito River, Tocome River, Caurimare River; on its southern slope we find that among the main tributaries are: El Valle river, Quebrada Baruta and Quebrada La Guairita. In the upper part of the basin there are two reservoirs with the purpose of supplying water to the western part of the city; These are the Macarao Dam and the La Mariposa Reservoir.

== Urbanism ==
Caracas shares commonalities with many Latin American cities: densely populated and with limited space because it is surrounded by mountains. Because of this, the city has grown vertically. A very striking aspect is the number of people living in substandard housing built on the mountain slopes surrounding the city. This type of housing is called ranchos, built improvised, without any official planning, with deficiencies and inadequate materials, marking a difference between those who live in the valley proper, 45% of the population in 25% of the urban area lives in these settlements.

The city center, developed around a small historic center, represents less than a quarter of the total area of the city, which has spread along the valley and has also been connected in recent years with satellite cities in the states of Miranda and La Guaira, creating a major metropolitan area known as Gran Caracas. The city&#x27;s rapid population growth has resulted in increasing traffic congestion. To this end, the subway transportation system (Metro de Caracas) has been progressively expanded and is currently linked to the Los Teques Metro and, in the future, to the Guarenas-Guatire Metro system. The &quot;Ezequiel Zamora&quot; Central Railway System also links the communities of Charallave and Cúa de los Valles del Tuy with the subway transportation of the capital city.

Some areas of the city have a grid layout, either inherited from the colony or developed during the urban projects of the 20th century. Other areas, built on the mountain slopes, do not follow this pattern, but adapt to the irregularities of the terrain. These elevated areas enjoy a temperate temperature throughout the year.

== Demographics ==

According to the population census of 2011 the Caracas proper (Distrito Capital) is over 1.9 million inhabitants, while that of the Metropolitan District of Caracas is estimated at 2.9 million . The majority of the population is mixed-race, typically with varying degrees of European, Indigenous, African and occasional Asian ancestry. There is a noteworthy Afro-Venezuelan community. Additionally, the city has a large number of both European Venezuelans and Asian Venezuelans who descend from the massive influx of various immigrants Venezuela received from all across Eurasia during the 20th century; in particular are descendants of Spaniards, Portuguese, Italians, Serbs, Chinese, Colombians, Germans, Syrians and Lebanese people. In 2020, the poorest 55% of the Caracas population lived on about a third of its land, in poorly planned slums that are generally dangerous to live in and access.

Caracas has exceeded the administrative limits of its perimeter due to accelerated population growth, so that its most suitable demographic study territory is the Metropolitan District or AMC. According to 2011 calculations by the National Institute of Statistics, the metropolitan city had a population for the 2011 census of 2,923,959 inhabitants. The Metropolitan District represents less than 1% of the national territory and is home to one-fifteenth of the total population of the country. In percentage numbers, 9.2% of the nation&#x27;s total population lives in the five capital municipalities, out of the 335 municipalities that comprise the country.

The region is called Greater Caracas or Metropolitan Region of Caracas (RMC) satellite cities or adjacent bedrooms: the Altos Mirandinos, the Central Coast of La Guaira, Guarenas, Guatire and the Valles del Tuy. This agglomeration had an estimated population of 4.3 million inhabitants in 2011.

In the 20th century, an exodus of the peasantry to the capital and other cities intensified, motivated by a search for improvements in their quality of life. This led to depopulation of the rural areas of the country and the demographic saturation of the centers. This saturation caused the expansion of marginal areas on the outskirts of the city; however, the lowest unemployment rates in the entire country correspond precisely to the metropolitan area of Caracas. In 1936, the total population of Venezuela had been equal to the estimated population of Greater Caracas for the year 2000: almost 4 million inhabitants. From 1936 to 1990, Caracas multiplied its population, although far less than any other major city in the country, such as Valencia, which in the same period of time multiplied its population almost 25 times.

Between the 1940s and 1950s, after the Second World War, a growing wave of European immigrants began, mostly Spanish, Portuguese and Italians and in other magnitudes, communities of Germans (Colonia Tovar), French, English, Serbs and Jews were established. New developments in Caracas were populated mainly by these European immigrants, such as La Florida and Altamira.
During the 1960s, President Rómulo Betancourt followed the same policy as the Marcos Pérez Jiménez government: promoting immigration, especially from Latin America and from other parts of the world. These policies were maintained until the late 1980s, with a notable influx of Argentines, Uruguayans, Chileans, Cubans, Peruvians, Ecuadorians, Chinese, and Arabs. Towards the beginning of the 1980s, immigration was marked by a strong exodus of Colombians.

The multiethnic, cultural and racial mix has marked the city throughout history. Its ethnic composition is very diverse.

=== Crime ===

Venezuela and its capital, Caracas, have been reported to both have among the highest per capita murder rates in the world. In 2010 Caracas had the highest murder rate in the world, having more deaths than Baghdad during the Iraq War, and in 2012 there were 13,080 murders in Venezuela, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. By 2019, Caracas was the city with the sixth highest homicide rate in the world outside of a warzone, with a rate of around 76 murders per 100,000 people. In 2023 it was the nineteenth, with a rate of around 52 murders per 100,000 people. Most murders and other violent crimes go unsolved, with estimates of the number of unresolved crimes as high as 98%. The U.S. Department of State and British Foreign and Commonwealth Office have issued travel warnings for Venezuela due to high rates of crime.

== Economy ==

Businesses that are located in Caracas include service companies, banks, and malls, among others. It has a largely service-based economy, apart from some industrial activity in its metropolitan area. The Caracas Stock Exchange and Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) are headquartered here. PDVSA, a state-run organization, is the largest company in Venezuela, and negotiates all the international agreements for the distribution and export of petroleum. When it existed, the airline Viasa had its headquarters in the Torre Viasa.

Several international companies and embassies are located in El Rosal and Las Mercedes, in the Caracas area. The city also serves as a hub for communication and transportation infrastructure between the metropolitan area and the rest of the country. Important industries in Caracas include chemicals, textiles, leather, food, iron, and wood products. There are also rubber and cement factories. Its nominal GDP is US$70 billion and the GDP (PPP) per capita is US$24,000.

A 2009 United Nations survey reported that the cost of living in Caracas was 89% of that of the survey&#x27;s baseline city, New York. However, this statistic is based upon a fixed currency-exchange-rate of 2003 and might not be completely realistic, due to the elevated inflation rates of the last several years.

=== Tourism ===

In 2013, the World Economic Forum evaluated countries in terms of how successful they were in advertising campaigns to attract foreign visitors. Out of the 140 countries evaluated, Venezuela came last. A major factor that has contributed to the lack of foreign visitors has been poor transport for tourists. Venezuela has limited railway systems and airlines. High crime rates and the negative attitude of the Venezuelan population towards tourism also contributed to the poor evaluation.

In an attempt to attract more foreign visitors, the Venezuelan Ministry of Tourism invested in multiple hotel infrastructures. The largest hotel investment has been in the Hotel Alba Caracas. The cost for the general maintenance of the north and south towers of the hotel is approximately 231.5 million Venezuelan bolivars. Although the Venezuelan Ministry of Tourism has taken the initiative to recognize the importance of the tourism industry, the Venezuelan government has not placed the tourism industry as an economic priority. In 2013, the budget for the Ministry of Tourism was only 173.8 million bolivars, while the Ministry of the Youth received approximately 724.6 million bolivars. The tourism industry in Venezuela contributes approximately 3.8 percent of the country GDP. The World Economic Forum predicts Venezuela&#x27;s GDP to rise to 4.2 percent by 2022.

== Government ==
On 8 March 2000, the year after a new constitution was introduced in Venezuela, it was decreed in &quot;Gaceta Official&quot; N° 36,906 that the Metropolitan District of Caracas would be created and that some of the powers of the Libertador, Chacao, Baruta, Sucre, and El Hatillo municipalities would be delegated to the &quot;Alcaldía Mayor&quot;, physically located in the large Libertador municipality, in the center of the city. The Metropolitan District of Caracas was suppressed on 20 December 2017 by the Constituent National Assembly of Venezuela.

=== Capital District ===

In the case of the Libertador Municipality of Caracas, the only member of the Capital District, the executive authority rests with the head of government of the Capital District, a position designated by the president of the republic.

According to Article 3 of the Capital District Law, the legislative function is exercised directly by the Republic through the National Assembly of Venezuela.

Before the creation of the Metropolitan District, the Federal District (current Capital District) had a governor appointed by the president of the republic, while the Caracas municipalities of the State of Miranda governed with their respective mayors in isolation, without any coordinating entity. In April 2009, the National Assembly reformed the Capital District Law, legalizing the constitution of a head of government or governor for the Libertador municipality designated by the National Executive.

Using as an argument what is established in article 156 of the constitution:

=== Metropolitan District ===
The city of Caracas occupies the entirety of the Libertador municipality of the Capital District and part of the state of Miranda, specifically the municipalities of Baruta, Chacao, El Hatillo and Sucre, which until 2011 formed the Metropolitan District of Caracas, which enjoyed legal personality and autonomy within the limits of the Constitution and the law.

Until that year, the Metropolitan Mayor was the first civil, political and administrative authority of the city of Caracas, as well as the municipal mayors in each of the municipalities comprising it. The Metropolitan District of Caracas was organized in a system of municipal government at two levels: the metropolitan or district and the municipalities.

== Transport ==
The Caracas Metro has been in operation since 27 March 1983, with four lines, 47 stations and about 10 more to be constructed. It covers a great part of the city and also has an integrated ticket system that combines the route of the &quot;Metro&quot; with those offered by the &quot;Metrobús&quot;, a bus service of the Caracas Metro. In 2010, the first segment of a new aerial cable car system opened, Metrocable which feeds into the larger metro system.

Buses are the main means of mass transportation. There are two bus systems: the traditional system and the &quot;Metrobús&quot;. Other transportation services include the IFE train to and from the Tuy Valley cities of Charallave and Cúa; the Simón Bolívar International Airport, the biggest and most important in the country; the metro additional services Caracas Aerial Tramway and Los Teques Metro (connecting Caracas with the suburban city of Los Teques); and the Generalissimo Francisco de Miranda Air Base used by military aviation and government airplanes.

=== Highways and main roads ===
The largest concentration of road networks in the country is in the Caracas region and its surroundings, with a large network of highways and avenues in the Metropolitan District and urban, suburban and interurban roads. The road network has become a great crossroads between the West, the East and the Center of the country. Not very advantageous role for a city saturated with population and vehicles of all kinds, both from the same city and from its immediate area of influence (La Guaira State, Valles del Tuy, Guarenas-Guatire, Altos Mirandinos) and from other areas of the country.

Currently, a link is being built that will connect the Central Regional highway (at km 31) with the Gran Mariscal de Ayacucho highway (Kempis sector), in order to serve as a spillway to the city of Caracas and neighboring Guarenas and Guatire, so that vehicles that go from east to west or center, and vice versa, do not have the need to enter Caracas. The route of this highway would be from the vicinity of the Charallave airport, passing through Santa Lucía and going up to the Kempis area (between Guatire and Caucagua).

Traffic in the Caracas Region is very congested, since it is the city with the largest number of cars in the country, causing traffic jams at any time in the city and being over-saturated at peak hours, where Caracas residents last up to 3 hours to get out of congestion.

Since 1986 a mysterious black substance referred to as La Mancha Negra (The Black Stain) has oozed from roads has caused many car accidents killing multiple people.

=== Caracas metro ===

It is one of the most important means of transportation in the city, since its 47 operating stations transport about 2 million people, according to official figures83 The Caracas Metro system covers the central area of the city from east to west, with lines that connect the southwest and with other surface systems of the Metro system (BusCaracas, MetroCable San Agustín) as well as the southeast (Cabletrén de Petare, Metrocable Mariche), Metrobús feeder routes in most of the stations, in addition to the expansion of lines existing stations (La Rinconada terminal station of line 3 and intermediate stations of the extension; interconnection of the Plaza Venezuela and Capuchinos stations – extension of line 2, better known as line 4, as well as the future interconnection with the Metro Guarenas Guatire system, which began with the Bello Monte station) and an appendix that extends to the city of Los Teques (capital of the Miranda state). The three stations that comprise this last line make up the Los Teques Metro System86. Both systems are operated by the company C. A. Metro de Caracas (Cametro)

The system inaugurated in 1983 has 71 km and with five lines, being one of the longest in Latin America and expansions of it are being built towards the towns of Guarenas and Guatire. The expansion plans also include the extension to the Baruta and Hatillo municipalities, as well as other metrocable systems in the city center.

=== BusCaracas ===
BusCaracas is a mass transit system that connects some areas of the Libertador municipality of Caracas. It began operations in October 201290, taking as a model other means of transportation such as the Trolemérida, and Transbarca. The work was undertaken by the Government of Venezuela through the Ministry of Public Works and Housing (MOPVI), the company in charge of the construction was VIALPA, until its contract was cancelled and replaced by PILPERCA in 2010, and inaugurated on 3 October 2012. Also known as Line 7 of the Caracas subway has 11 stations with two connections to the subway system at La Hoyada and La bandera, lines 1 and 3 respectively.

=== Metrocable ===

The Caracas Metrocable is a cable car system integrated into the Caracas Metro, conceived in such a way that residents of Caracas neighborhoods usually located in mountainous areas can travel faster and safer to the city center. It works like a feeder route in the style of the metrobus.

In 2011, a new metrocable system was built in the Parroquia de San Agustín del Sur, where people can freely go and enjoy a view of a large part of Caracas.

=== Rail system ===
There is a national railway project, which aims to connect Caracas with the central area of the country. Currently, the Caracas-Cúa train service is operating, belonging to the Central Railway System of Venezuela &quot;Ezequiel Zamora I&quot;. Inaugurated in 2006, it is the only railway section currently operating in Venezuela, according to the Instituto de Ferrocarriles del Estado (IFE). This commuter train line connects the city of Caracas with the towns of the Valles del Tuy (Charallave, Santa Lucía, Ocumare, Santa Teresa, Yare and Cúa) and runs for 41.4 kilometers.

The network begins its journey at the Libertador Simón Bolivar station in Caracas, located in La Rinconada and connected to line 3 of the Caracas metro. From the city it communicates with three other stations: Charallave Norte Francisco de Miranda and Charallave Sur Don Simón Rodríguez; both in the town of Charallave and ends at the Cúa General Ezequiel Zamora station (Cúa, Miranda).

<text>Daniel Gedeon Burkhard (born 3 July 1969) is a German film and television actor. Although he has appeared in numerous films and TV series in both Europe and the US, he is probably best recognised for his role as Alexander Brandtner in the Austrian/German television series &quot;Kommissar Rex&quot; (1998–2001), or as Corporal Wilhelm Wicki in the 2009 film &quot;Inglourious Basterds&quot;. He is also well recognised for his role as Chris Ritter in the long-running series &quot;Alarm für Cobra 11&quot;.

==Life and career==
Gedeon Burkhard was born in Munich, West Germany, the son of Wolfgang Burkhard and German actress Elisabeth von Molo (then Burkhard) who is the granddaughter of Alexander Moissi, a famous Albanian-born Austrian actor of the 20th century. Gedeon was educated at a boarding school in England and began his acting career in 1979 in the German TV film &quot;Tante Maria&quot;.

During the 1990s, he lived in the United States, working in several productions, but without much recognition. Burkhard married Birgit Cunningham, then divorced three months later. After that, he lived in Vienna for &quot;Kommisar Rex&quot; for more than five years, then moved to Berlin. Burkhard was working in Cologne on the TV series &quot;Alarm für Cobra 11&quot; as the detective Chris Ritter until November 2007. His character Chris Ritter had a heroic death. He then returned to Berlin to be close to his daughter and to work on projects. He said &quot;For the moment I will dedicate myself again fully to my artistic vagabond life in Berlin&quot;. Burkhard appeared in the Quentin Tarantino movie &quot;Inglourious Basterds&quot;. In February 2009, he was shooting the film &quot;Massel&quot;, made for German television. In 2011, he was in Rome, shooting the Italian miniseries &quot;Caccia al Re – La narcotici&quot;.

In 2011, he competed in &quot;Ballando con le Stelle&quot;, the Italian version of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, accompanied by professional Italian dancer Samanta Togni, in which he danced with his &quot;daughter&quot; Laura Glavan.

In 2016, Burkhard played Gustav Froehlich, a German actor and UFA star, in the international movie &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Mistress&quot; by Czech director Filip Renč. The biographical film is about the life of actress Lída Baarová and her relationship with Joseph Goebbels. The film was released in January 2016 in Prague.

<doc id="55293" wikidata="Q114969" url="?curid=55293" title="Niagara County, New York">
<text>Niagara County is in the U.S. state of New York. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 212,666. The county seat is Lockport. The county name is from the Iroquois word &quot;Onguiaahra&quot;; meaning &quot;the strait&quot; or &quot;thunder of waters&quot;. The county is part of the Western New York region of the state.

Niagara County is part of the Buffalo–Niagara Falls metropolitan area, and across the Canada–US border is the province of Ontario.

It is the location of Niagara Falls and Fort Niagara, and has many parks and lake shore recreation communities. In the summer of 2008, Niagara County celebrated its 200th birthday with the first settlement of the county, of Niagara Falls.

==History==
When counties were established in the New York colony in 1683, the present Niagara County was part of Albany County. Prior to the British, the area was part of New Netherland.

Albany was an enormous county, including the northern part of New York State as well as all of the present State of Vermont and, in theory, extending westward to the Pacific Ocean. This county was reduced in size on July 3, 1766, by the creation of Cumberland County, and further on March 16, 1770, by the creation of Gloucester County, both containing territory now in Vermont.

On March 12, 1772, what was left of Albany County was split into three parts, one remaining under the name Albany County. One of the other pieces, Tryon County, contained the western portion (and thus, since no western boundary was specified, theoretically still extended west to the Pacific). The eastern boundary of Tryon County was approximately five miles west of the present city of Schenectady, and the county included the western part of the Adirondack Mountains and the area west of the West Branch of the Delaware River. The area then designated as Tryon County now includes 37 counties of New York State. The county was named for William Tryon, colonial governor of New York.

In the years prior to 1776, most of the Loyalists in Tryon County fled to Canada including the likes of local judge John Butler and militia commander Sir John Johnson. In 1784, following the peace treaty that ended the American Revolutionary War, the name of Tryon County was changed to honor the general, Richard Montgomery, who had captured several places in Canada and died attempting to capture the city of Quebec, replacing the name of the hated British governor.

In 1789, Ontario County was split off from Montgomery. In turn, Genesee County was created from Ontario County in 1802.

Niagara County was created from Genesee County in 1808. It was, however, larger than the present Niagara County even though it consisted of only the Town of Cambria.

From 1814 to 1817, records of Cattaraugus County were divided between Belmont (the seat of Allegany County) and Buffalo (then in Niagara County). Niagara County governed the western portion of Cattaraugus County, then known as the town of Perry.

In 1821, Erie County was created from Niagara County.

The county has a number of properties on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 1,139 square miles, of which is land and (54%) is water.

Niagara County is in the most western part of New York State, just north of the city Buffalo and bordering Lake Ontario on its northern border, and the Niagara River Canada on its western border.

The county&#x27;s primary geographic feature is Niagara Falls, the riverbed of which has eroded seven miles south over the past 12,000 years since the last ice age. The Niagara River and Niagara Falls, are in effect, the drainage ditch for four of the Great Lakes which constitute the world&#x27;s largest supply of fresh water. The water flows north from Lake Erie, then through the Niagara River, goes over Niagara Falls, and then on to Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River, eventually emptying into the North Atlantic Ocean. Today, tourists and visitors to the Falls see a diminished flow of water over the Falls, since a portion of the flow has been diverted for hydroelectric power purposes. Both the American and Canadian side of the Niagara River have massive electrical power plants.

The Niagara Gorge is the path Niagara Falls has taken over thousands of years as it continues to erode. Niagara Falls started at the Niagara Escarpment which cuts Niagara County in half in an east–west direction. North of the Escarpment lies the Lake Plain, which is a fertile flatland used to grow grapes, apples, peaches and other fruits and vegetables. The grape variety Niagara, source of most American white grape juice but not esteemed for wine, was first grown in the county, in 1868. Viticulture, or wine culture has begun to take place, with several wineries below the escarpment. This has helped to improve the depressed economy of the region.

==Government and politics==


















===Structure===
Niagara County is governed by a 15-member Legislature, with the Chairman of the Legislature as the de facto head of county government. The 2024 Legislature, consists of 12 members of the Republican-led Majority Caucus and three members of the Democratic-led Minority Caucus. The Legislature formerly consisted of 19 members, but was downsized to 15 seats effective January 1, 2012, based on the results of a public referendum.

A subordinate county manager reports to the County Legislature. Governing functions of the Legislature rely on a committee system. There are five standing committees and one long-term ad hoc committee: Administration; Community Services; Community Safety and Security; Economic Development; Public Works; and the &quot;ad hoc&quot; Refuse Disposal District Committee.

The dominant political party in the Niagara County Legislature is currently the Republican Party, which is ancestrally the dominant party in Niagara County.

<doc id="55294" wikidata="Q115043" url="?curid=55294" title="Oneida County, New York">
<text>Oneida County ( ) is a county in the state of New York, United States. As of February 26, 2024, the population was 226,654. The county seat is Utica. The name is in honor of the Oneida, one of the Five Nations of the Iroquois League or &quot;Haudenosaunee&quot;, which had long occupied this territory at the time of European encounter and colonization. The federally recognized Oneida Indian Nation has had a reservation in the region since the late 18th century, after the American Revolutionary War. The county is part of the Mohawk Valley region of the state.

Oneida County is part of the Utica–Rome, NY Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
When England established colonial counties in the Province of New York in 1683, the territory of present Oneida County was included in a very large, mostly undeveloped Albany County. This county included the northern part of present-day New York State as well as all of the present state of Vermont and, in theory, extended westward to the Pacific Ocean. This county was reduced in size on July 3, 1766, to create Cumberland County, and further on March 16, 1770, by the creation of Gloucester County, both containing territory now in Vermont.

On March 12, 1772, what was left of Albany County was split into three parts, one remaining under the name Albany County. Tryon County contained the western portion (and thus, since no western boundary was specified, theoretically still extended west to the Pacific). The eastern boundary of Tryon County was approximately five miles west of the present city of Schenectady in the Mohawk River Valley, and the county included the western part of the Adirondack Mountains and the area west of the West Branch of the Delaware River. Tryon County was later divided to organize 37 distinct counties of New York State. The county was named for William Tryon, colonial governor of New York.

During and after the Revolution, most of the Loyalists in Tryon County fled to Canada. In 1784, following the peace treaty that ended the American Revolutionary War, Americans changed the name of Tryon County to Montgomery County to honor the general, Richard Montgomery, who had captured several places in Canada and died attempting to capture the city of Quebec. They replaced the name of the British governor.

In 1789, Montgomery County was reduced by the splitting off of Ontario County from Montgomery. The area taken from Montgomery County contained all of present-day Allegany, Cattaraugus, Chautauqua, Erie, Genesee, Livingston, Monroe, Niagara, Orleans, Steuben, Wyoming, Yates, and part of Schuyler and Wayne counties, as well as Ontario County.

After continued new settlement, in 1791 Herkimer County was one of three counties taken from Montgomery (the other two being Otsego, and Tioga County). It was much larger than the present Herkimer County, however, and was reduced by a number of subsequent splits.

In 1794, Herkimer County was reduced in size by the creation of Onondaga County. This county was larger than the current Onondaga County, including the present Cayuga, Cortland, and part of Oswego counties.

In 1798, Oneida County was created from another part of Herkimer County. This county was larger than the current Oneida County, as it included the present-day Jefferson (which extends along Lake Ontario), Lewis, and part of Oswego counties.

In 1805, Jefferson and Lewis counties were split off from Oneida. In 1816, parts of Oneida and Onondaga counties were taken to form the new Oswego County.

Together with Utica, Oneida county was the cultural centre of Welsh settlement in New York state. By the mid-nineteenth century, the lexicorapher John Russell Bartlett noted that the area had a number of Welsh language newspapers and magazines, as well as Welsh churches. Indeed Bartlett noted in his &quot;Dictionary of Americanisms&quot; that &quot;one may travel for miles and hear nothing but the Welsh language&quot;. By 1855, there were four thousand Welshmen in Oneida.

In 1848, John Humphrey Noyes founded a religious and Utopian community, the Oneida Community, near Oneida. Its unconventional views on religion and relations between the sexes generated much controversy. The community lasted until 1881. The Oneida Silver Company was founded here to manufacture sterling silver, silverplate holloware and, later, stainless steel flatware.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (3.6%) is water.

Oneida County is in the central portion of New York State, east of Syracuse, and west of Albany. Oneida Lake is on the northwestern corner of the county, and the Adirondack Park is on the northeast. Part of the Tug Hill Plateau is in the northern part of the county. Oneida County&#x27;s highest point lies neither on the plateau nor in the Adirondack Park, but in the county&#x27;s southern extremity. The peak&#x27;s name is Tassel Hill. It is located slightly southeast of Hardscrabble Road (Tassel Hill Road), between the villages of Waterville and Cassville.

The Erie Canal, completed in 1825, runs east–west along the Mohawk River through the county. It stimulated considerable trade and settlement. Oneida Lake and Oneida Creek form part of the western boundary.

In the early 21st century, Oneida is the only county in New York state documented as having Chronic wasting disease among its wild White-tailed deer.

==Government and politics==


















A board of supervisors governed Oneida County until 1962, when the county charter was changed to create a county executive and a 29-seat county legislature. The entire county elects the county executive. On January 1, 2014, the Oneida County Legislature was reduced to 23 seats. All 23 members are elected from single-member districts. Currently, there are 17 Republicans and 6 Democrats.

Oneida County also leans Republican in major statewide and national elections. The last Democratic presidential nominee to carry Oneida County was Bill Clinton in 1996, by plurality. The last Democrat to win a majority in the county was Lyndon Johnson in his 1964 landslide. In 2008, Republican John McCain won the county by 6,000 votes out of 90,000 cast. He won all municipalities in the county except the city of Utica and the town of Kirkland. In 2012, Republican Mitt Romney won the county by even fewer votes, by around 4,000 plus votes. Republican Donald Trump returned the county to its reliably red roots, posting strong victories in 2016, 2020, and 2024.

==Economy==
The main product of Oneida County was once silverware, chiefly manufactured at Oneida Ltd.&#x27;s headquarters in Sherrill. In January 2005, the company ceased manufacturing their product, closing its main plant and selling its assets. The factory, under new ownership, continues to produce American-made silverware under the Liberty Tabletop brand.

Currently the largest non-governmental, non-healthcare product of Oneida County is gambling. Turning Stone Casino Resort is an enterprise of the Oneida Indian Nation of New York, and the largest private employer in Oneida County.

<text>Onondaga County ( ) is a county in the U.S. state of New York. As of the 2020 census, the population was 476,516. The county seat is Syracuse. The county is part of the Central New York region of the state.

Onondaga County is the core of the Syracuse Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
The name &quot;Onondaga&quot; derives from the name of the Native American tribe indigenous to this area, one of the original Five Nations of the &quot;Haudenosaunee&quot;. They call themselves (autonym) &quot;Onoda&#x27;gega&quot;, sometimes spelled &quot;Onontakeka.&quot; The word means &quot;People of the Hills.&quot; Sometimes the term is &quot;Onondagaono&quot; (&quot;The People of the Hills&quot;). The federally recognized Onondaga Nation has a reservation within the county, on which they have self-government.

When counties were established in New York in 1683, the present Onondaga County was part of Albany County. This enormous county included the northern part of New York State as well as all of the present State of Vermont and, in theory, extended westward to the Pacific Ocean. It was reduced in size on July 3, 1766, by the creation of Cumberland County, and further on March 16, 1770, by the creation of Gloucester County, both containing territory now in Vermont.

On March 12, 1772, what was left of Albany County was split into three parts, one remaining under the name Albany County. One of the other pieces, Tryon County, contained the western portion (and thus, since no western boundary was specified, theoretically still extended west to the Pacific). The eastern boundary of Tryon County was approximately west of the present city of Schenectady, and the county included the western part of the Adirondack Mountains and the area west of the West Branch of the Delaware River. The area then designated as Tryon County now includes 37 counties of New York State. The county was named for William Tryon, colonial governor of New York.

In the years prior to 1776, most of the Loyalists in Tryon County fled to Canada. The Onondaga were among four Iroquois tribes that allied with the British against the American colonists, as they hoped to end their encroachment. Instead, they were forced to cede most of their land in New York to the United States after the war. Many Onondaga went with Joseph Brant and other nations to Canada, where they received land grants in compensation and formed the Six Nations of the Grand River First Nation.

In 1784, after a peace treaty ended the American Revolutionary War, the name of Tryon County was changed to Montgomery County. It honored General Richard Montgomery, who had captured several places in Canada and died attempting to capture the city of Quebec, and replaced the name of the hated British governor.

In 1789, Montgomery County was reduced by the splitting off of Ontario County from Montgomery. The actual area split off from Montgomery County was much larger than the present county, also including the present Allegany, Cattaraugus, Chautauqua, Erie, Genesee, Livingston, Monroe, Niagara, Orleans, Steuben, Wyoming, Yates, and part of Schuyler and Wayne Counties.

In 1791, Herkimer County was one of three counties split off from Montgomery (the other two being Otsego, and Tioga County). This was much larger than the present county, however, and was reduced by a number of subsequent splits.

In 1794, Onondaga County was split off from Herkimer County. This county was larger than the current Onondaga County, including the present Cayuga, Cortland, and part of Oswego Counties.

In 1799, Cayuga County was split off from Onondaga.

In 1808, Cortland County was split off from Onondaga.

In 1816, parts of Oneida and Onondaga Counties were taken to form the new Oswego County.

At the time Onondaga County was organized, it was divided into eleven towns: Homer, Pompey, Manlius, Lysander, Marcellus, Ulysses, Milton, Scipio, Ovid, Aurelius and Romulus.

Central New York developed rapidly after the New Military Tract provided land in lieu of payment to Revolutionary War veterans. Migration was largely from the east, mostly from New England states. The Genesee Road, which became the Seneca Turnpike in 1800, provided access. Generally settlers preferred higher land, since they associated lowlands with disease. Over time, as early clearing and farming eroded hillside soil, valley lands were more fertile and highly prized for agriculture as well as for water power, which was the origin of many communities. An early settler of 1823 was James Hutchinson Woodworth, a native of Washington County, NY. He helped clear land for his family&#x27;s farm in this region before he moved to Chicago where he became Mayor. The completion of the Erie Canal across New York state in 1825 accelerated trade, development and migration.

The city of Syracuse, New York developed relatively late, due to its marshy situation. It was incorporated as a village in 1825 and as a city in 1847; by contrast, the Village of Manlius, along the Cherry Valley and Seneca Turnpikes, was incorporated in 1813. The population of these rural towns was greatest in the late nineteenth century, when more people cultivated land and farms were relatively small, supporting large households.

Since that time, agriculture has declined in the county. Some Onondaga County towns like Spafford were largely depopulated and many villages became veritable ghost towns. Onondaga County highlands now are more heavily reforested, with public parks and preserves providing recreation. Two Finger Lakes in the county, Skaneateles and Otisco, also attract visitors. The village of Skaneateles on scenic Route 20 has become a major tourist destination.

At the turn of the twenty-first century, population declined in the City of Syracuse while suburban communities generally grew, particularly with tract developments north of the city. Elsewhere, scattered commuter houses appeared, generally on fairly large parcels. The rapid development of the village of Skaneateles and shores of Skaneateles Lake led to increased demand for property and property values.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has an area of , of which is land and (3.4%) is water. The geographic dimensions of the county are illustrated as approximately in length and in width, and comprising of the New York State Barge Canal System, in combination with a number of lakes, streams and rivers. Onondaga County is in the central portion of New York State, west of Albany and Utica, east of Rochester and northeast of Ithaca. Onondaga Lake is bordered by many of the larger communities in the county. The highest point in Onondaga County is at 2057 feet, along Morgan Hill located just east of Morgan Hill State Forest on private property. The second highest point in Onondaga County is at 2019 feet elevation and on the summit of Fellows Hill which is located in Morgan Hill State Forest near Fabius and Apulia south of state route 80.

The northern part of the county is fairly level lake plain, extending northward to Lake Ontario. Oneida Lake three rivers, as well as the Erie and subsequent Barge Canals are in the lake plain. The main line of the New York Central Railroad and the New York State Thruway extend east and west across the county through the lake plain. The southern part of the county is Appalachian Plateau, with high hills rising at the southern edge of Syracuse. This is the eastern part of the Finger Lakes region. Skaneateles Lake and Otisco Lake are both in Onondaga County. US 20 extends east and west across the county, traversing dramatic hill-and-valley terrain. Between the lake plain and Appalachian highlands is a zone noted for drumlins, smaller, scattered hills formed as mounds of debris left by the last glacier. Tully is geologically noted for the terminal moraine deposited there by the glacier, filling the deep Tully Valley, which might have been another Finger Lake had the moraine been left closer to Syracuse, impounding water. Tully is at the divide between two major watersheds, one flowing northward to the Atlantic Ocean by way of the St. Lawrence River and the other southward to the ocean via the Susquehanna River. Oneida Lake, the Finger Lakes, and smaller bodies of water provide recreation. The Appalachian hills have several ski areas, waterfalls and historic villages as well as large parks and forest preserves.

==Government and politics==













=== Government ===
Onondaga County was governed exclusively by a board of supervisors until 1961, when voters approved the creation of the county executive. In 1968, the board reorganized into a 24-seat county legislature. In 2001, the legislature was reduced to 19 seats. In 2010, voters approved a measure to reduce the legislature to 17 seats. None of the legislative seats, nor the county executive&#x27;s seat, are at-large. Currently, there are 11 Republicans and 6 Democrats. J. Ryan McMahon II (R) is the current County Executive.

=== Politics ===
Historically, Onondaga County was a Republican stronghold, like most of Central New York. From 1856 to 1988, the GOP carried the county in all but one presidential election, Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s landslide in 1964. Since 1992, the county has gone Democratic in every presidential election, much like many urban counties around the country. However, it is a swing county in congressional, state and local races. Onondaga is entirely located within New York&#x27;s 22nd Congressional District, represented by Democrat John Mannion. Democratic strength is concentrated in Syracuse itself, while Republicans do well in the suburbs.


, the sheriff of Onondaga County is Eugene J. Conway. Along with Broome County, New York, Onondaga County was sued in 2017 over placing juvenile inmates in solitary confinement.

<text>A registered nurse (RN) is a nurse who has graduated or successfully passed a nursing program from a recognized nursing school and met the requirements outlined by a country, state, province or similar government-authorized licensing body to obtain a nursing license. An RN&#x27;s scope of practice is determined by legislation, and is regulated by a professional body or council.

Registered nurses are employed in a wide variety of professional settings, and often specialize in a field of practice. Depending on the jurisdiction, they may be responsible for supervising care delivered by other healthcare workers, including student nurses, licensed practical nurses, unlicensed assistive personnel, and less-experienced RNs.

Registered nurses must usually meet a minimum practice hours requirement and undertake continuing education to maintain their license. Furthermore, certain jurisdictions require that an RN remain free from serious criminal convictions.

==History==
Florence Nightingale was a British nurse who provided the foundation of modern nursing. Nightingale obtained her experience during the Crimean War. In 1860, Nightingale established the St. Thomas Hospital and the Nightingale Training School for Nurses.
The registration of nurses by nursing councils or boards began in the early twentieth century. New Zealand registered the first nurse in 1901 with the establishment of the Nurses Registration Act. Nurses were required to complete three years of training and pass a state-administered examination. Registration ensured a degree of consistency in the education of new nurses, and the title was usually protected by law. After 1905 in California, for example, it became a misdemeanour to claim to be an RN without a certificate of registration. Today, typical requirements for an RN licence in the United States include earning either an associate degree (community college) or a baccalaureate degree (college or university) in nursing and passing an examination.

Registration acts allowed authorities a degree of control over who was admitted to the profession. Requirements varied by location, but often included a stipulation that the applicant must be &quot;of good moral character&quot; and must not have mental or physical conditions that rendered them unable to practice.

Before the 1870s, most people were cared for at home by family members. The view on nursing began to change as more medical advances were made during the end of the 19th century and leading into the beginning of the 20th century.

==Benefits of nursing==
When obtaining a nursing degree, there are personal benefits that come with it. One personal benefit is that nursing is a highly respected position. Another personal advantage is the availability of jobs; nurses are in high demand. Nursing also provides many different possibilities of employment, because with a nursing degree, there are many positions that fall under this category. Being able to explore multiple options gives someone the chance to find the most suitable job for themselves. Nurses are generally in demand around the world. The World Health Organization estimates that by 2030 there will be a world-wide shortage of 4.5 million nurses.

Patients benefit from having a sufficient number of nurses to meet the clinic&#x27;s or hospital&#x27;s needs. As the number of nurses increases, the quality of life for the patients increases as well.

== Issues within registered nursing ==
Nurses are responsible for providing a high quality of care and maintaining the well-being of patients. With that being said, various situations cause nurses to feel overwhelmed. For example when an excessive workload results in missed nursing. An excessive workload can make errors and mishaps more likely. Insufficient time to complete tasks and inadequate staffing also contribute to missed aspects of nursing care. An indicator of an excessive workload correlates with missed nursing care and activities. Missed care and activities may cause nurses to feel stressed and anxious. Nurses often experience sleep disturbance which can result in lost sleep or inability to fall asleep.

==By nation==
===Australia===
Nursing registration in Australia has been at a national level since 2010, since the inception of the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia (NMBA), which forms part of the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA). Prior to 2010, Nursing registration in Australia was administered individually by each state and territory.

The title &#x27;Registered Nurse&#x27; (also known in the state of Victoria as a &#x27;Division 1 Nurse&#x27;) is granted to a nurse who has successfully completed a board-approved course in the field of nursing, as outlined by education and registration standards defined by the NMBA. Registered Nurses are also required to meet certain other standards to fulfil registration standards as outlined by the NMBA, and these can include continuing professional development, recency of practice, criminal history checks and competency in the English language. A nurse who is registered with the NMBA, and as such AHPRA, is free to practice in any state or territory in Australia, providing they meet the governing boards requirements and the individual state/territory legislative requirements, such as working with children checks and individual police checks for that state or territory.

Educational requirements for an entry-level Registered Nurse are at the level of bachelor&#x27;s degree in Australia, and can range in two to four years in length with three years being the national average. Some universities offer a two-year &#x27;fast track&#x27; bachelor&#x27;s degree, whereby a students study three years worth of coursework compressed in a two-year period. This is made possible by reducing summer and winter semester breaks and utilising three semesters per year compared to two. Some universities also offer combined degrees which allow the graduate to exit the program with a Masters in Nursing, e.g.: Bachelor of Science/Master of Nursing, and these are generally offered over a four-year period.

Postgraduate nursing education is widespread in Australia and is encouraged by employing bodies such as state health services (e.g. New South Wales Health). There are many varying courses and scholarships available which provide a bachelor-level Registered Nurse the opportunity to &#x27;up-skill&#x27; and assume an extended scope of practice. Such courses are offered at all levels of the post graduate spectrum and range from graduate certificate to master&#x27;s degree and provide a theoretical framework for a bachelor level Registered nurse to take up an advanced practice position such as Clinical Nurse Specialist (CNS), Clinical Nurse Consultant (CNC) and Nurse Practitioner (NP).

Rural and Remote nursing is an important sub-speciality within Australia and Registered Nurses with advanced practice skills and of which have undertaken further training, such as Pharmacotherapeutics for Remote Area Nurses (RAN&#x27;s), Immunisation Certificate, Remote Emergency Care / Remote Pre Hospital Trauma Certification and Midwifery Emergency Care Courses, permit a generalist Registered Nurse to undertake an advanced scope of practice to operate autonomously within certain clinical situations under the guidance of a &#x27;standard treatment manual&#x27; such as the Central Australian Remote Practitioners Association (CARPA) manuals as opposed to the direct order of a medical practitioner whilst practising in a remote/isolated setting. A Registered Nurse at this level would be professionally referred to as a &#x27;Remote Area Nurse&#x27; or &#x27;Clinical Nurse Specialist - Speciality&#x27;.

===Canada===
In all Canadian provinces except Quebec, newly registered nurses are required to have a Bachelor of Science in Nursing. This is either achieved through a four-year university (or collaborative) program or through a bridging program for registered practical nurses or licensed practical nurses. Some universities also offer compressed programs for applicants already holding a bachelor&#x27;s degree in another field.

Prior to 2015, initial licensure as an RN required passing the Canadian Registered Nurse Examination (CRNE) offered by the Canadian Nurses Association. As of 2015, for initial licensure, Canadian RNs must pass the NCLEX-RN exam offered by the National Council of State Boards of Nursing. In Quebec, the &#x27;Ordre des infirmières et infirmiers du Québec&#x27; (Quebec Order of Nurses) administers their own licensing exam for registration within the province.

===Denmark===
In Denmark, nurses are certified by the Danish Ministry of Health. It is also the ministry that keeps track of violations and can retract individual authorization.

===Hong Kong===
Applicants must complete a pre-registration nursing program lasting not less than 3 years to enroll as registered nurses. Applicants trained outside Hong Kong must have a practicing certificate recognized by the Nursing Council of Hong Kong and pass the Licensing Examination for Registration.

===India===

In the Republic of India nursing is regulated by the Indian Nursing Council.

===Malaysia===
In Malaysia, nursing is regulated by the Ministry of Health Malaysia Nursing Division.

===United Kingdom===

===United States===
In the US, a registered nurse is a professional clinician who has completed at least an associate degree in nursing or a hospital-based diploma program, followed by successfully completing the NCLEX-RN examination for initial licensure. Other requirements vary by state. More information about the NCLEX-RN examination and specific state nursing boards is provided by the National Council of State Boards of Nursing. A BSN degree is preferred by many employers. To obtain state licensure, applicants must also meet clinical nursing requirements and pass the NCLEX-RN. Six weeks prior to graduation, students may submit an application for licensure and then sign up for the NCLEX-RN.

Although associate degree programs are often two years, Associate of Science in Nursing (ASN) degrees frequently take three years to complete because of the increased volume of undergraduate coursework related to the profession of nursing, sometimes as part of the program itself and sometimes as prerequisites for admission. Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) degrees include more thorough coursework in leadership and community health, as well as more clinical hours, and can be completed as an extension of an Associate program or standalone. Accelerated versions of both exist, and are considered particularly challenging due to the increased course-load necessary to complete the program in a short time. Some employers, especially hospitals, may require a bachelor&#x27;s degree even for entry-level positions; however, it is also increasingly common for hospitals to hire ASN-licensed individuals for limited practice, under the condition that the individual complete a BSN within a designated time-frame, typically 2–3 years.

Specialty certification is available through organizations such as the American Nurses Credentialing Center, a subsidiary of the American Nurses Association. After meeting the eligibility requirements and passing the appropriate specialty certification exam, the designation of Registered Nurse – Board Certified (RN-BC) credential is granted.

Registered Nurses can work in a variety of settings including hospitals, physicians&#x27; offices, nursing homes, and home health care services. The median pay for a registered nurse in 2016, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, was $68,450.00 per year with a bachelor&#x27;s degree. RNs can progress to become clinical nurse specialists, nurse practitioners, certified nurse midwives, or nurse anesthetists after obtaining a graduate nursing degree.

In some states, the law allows nurses with higher-level degrees, such as Masters of Science in Nursing (MSN) or Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) to work with increased autonomy, permitting them to practice limited medicine including sometimes even the prescription of medication without the official supervision of a licensed physician (MD or DO). However, a number of advanced nursing degree programs are sufficiently specialized for work within a hospital setting (for example, Nurse Anesthetist) that it is uncommon for such nurses to run their own medical practice.

Nurses in the United States follow the Nurse Practice Act (NPA) which are laws that protect the public&#x27;s health and welfare by outlining the safe practices of nursing. All states and territories in the U.S. have a nurse practice act. The rules and regulations may vary from state to state. It is important to know the current laws governing nursing practices in their state.

Typical requirements to get into a nursing school: High School diploma, required GPA for school of choice, admissions application, personal essay, personal interview, teacher recommendations, volunteer experience (preferably in healthcare), application fee, test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) if applicable, minimum SAT scores or TEAS. Students who wish to pursue either an ADN or a BSN in nursing must first fulfill the necessary liberal arts, math, and scientific prerequisites. Basic anatomy, physiology, biology, psychology, and anatomy are frequently required courses for nursing programs. A minimum &quot;C&quot; grade in these courses is frequently needed for admission to nursing schools.

==Economics==
As of 2011, there are 2.24 million registered nurses in China. In 2014, the United States had approximately 2,751,000 registered nurses and Canada had just over 250,000. In the US and Canada this works out to approximately eight nurses per 1,000 people. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, registered nursing jobs are projected to grow by 15% between 2016 and 2026, which is much faster than the average overall rate. The growth rate in the United States has a number of reasons, including an increased interest in preventive care, an increase in chronic illnesses, and the demands of services required by the baby boom generation. The highest-paid registered nurses in the United States are in California. California cities often comprise the top five highest-paying metropolitan areas for registered nurses in the country. Most registered nurses start working with competitive salaries. The median annual salary for registered nurses was $80,000 per year as of June 2020, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS.) The lowest 10 percent of RN&#x27;s earned less than $70,000, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $101,360 for 2015.

<doc id="55309" wikidata="Q47657" url="?curid=55309" title="Blood type">
<text>A blood type (also known as a blood group) is a classification of blood, based on the presence and absence of antibodies and inherited antigenic substances on the surface of red blood cells (RBCs). These antigens may be proteins, carbohydrates, glycoproteins, or glycolipids, depending on the blood group system. Some of these antigens are also present on the surface of other types of cells of various tissues. Several of these red blood cell surface antigens can stem from one allele (or an alternative version of a gene) and collectively form a blood group system.

Blood types are inherited and represent contributions from both parents of an individual. a total of 45 human blood group systems are recognized by the International Society of Blood Transfusion (ISBT). The two most important blood group systems are ABO and Rh; they determine someone&#x27;s blood type (A, B, AB, and O, with + or − denoting RhD status) for suitability in blood transfusion.

==Blood group systems==
A complete blood type would describe each of the 45 blood groups, and an individual&#x27;s blood type is one of many possible combinations of blood-group antigens. Almost always, an individual has the same blood group for life, but very rarely an individual&#x27;s blood type changes through addition or suppression of an antigen in infection, malignancy, or autoimmune disease. Another more common cause of blood type change is a bone marrow transplant. Bone-marrow transplants are performed for many leukemias and lymphomas, among other diseases. If a person receives bone marrow from someone of a different ABO type (e.g., a type O patient receives a type A bone marrow), the patient&#x27;s blood type should eventually become the donor&#x27;s type, as the patient&#x27;s hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are destroyed, either by ablation of the bone marrow or by the donor&#x27;s T-cells. Once all the patient&#x27;s original red blood cells have died, they will have been fully replaced by new cells derived from the donor HSCs. Provided the donor had a different ABO type, the new cells&#x27; surface antigens will be different from those on the surface of the patient&#x27;s original red blood cells.

Some blood types are associated with inheritance of other diseases; for example, the Kell antigen is sometimes associated with McLeod syndrome.For another example, Von Willebrand disease may be more severe or apparent in people with blood type O. Certain blood types may affect susceptibility to infections. For example, people with blood type O may be less susceptible to pro-thrombotic events induced by COVID-19 or long covid. Another example being the resistance to specific malaria species seen in individuals lacking the Duffy antigen. The Duffy antigen, presumably as a result of natural selection, is less common in population groups from areas having a high incidence of malaria. 

===ABO blood group system===


The ABO blood group system involves two antigens and two antibodies found in human blood. The two antigens are antigen A and antigen B. The two antibodies are antibody A and antibody B. The antigens are present on the red blood cells and the antibodies in the serum. Regarding the antigen property of the blood all human beings can be classified into four groups, those with antigen A (group A), those with antigen B (group B), those with both antigen A and B (group AB) and those with neither antigen (group O). The antibodies present together with the antigens are found as follows:
# Antigen A with antibody B
# Antigen B with antibody A
# Antigen AB with neither antibody A nor B
# Antigen null (group O) with both antibody A and B

There is an agglutination reaction between similar antigen and antibody (for example, antigen A agglutinates the antibody A and antigen B agglutinates the antibody B). Thus, transfusion can be considered safe as long as the serum of the recipient does not contain antibodies for the blood cell antigens of the donor.

The ABO system is the most important blood-group system in human-blood transfusion. The associated anti-A and anti-B antibodies are usually immunoglobulin M, abbreviated IgM, antibodies. It has been hypothesized that ABO IgM antibodies are produced in the first years of life by sensitization to environmental substances such as food, bacteria, and viruses, although blood group compatibility rules are applied to newborn and infants as a matter of practice. The original terminology used by Karl Landsteiner in 1901 for the classification was A/B/C; in later publications &quot;C&quot; became &quot;O&quot;. Type O is often called &quot;0&quot; (&quot;zero&quot;, or &quot;null&quot;) in other languages.
===Rh blood group system===

The Rh system (Rh meaning &quot;Rhesus&quot;) is the second most significant blood-group system in human-blood transfusion with currently 50 antigens. The most significant Rh antigen is the D antigen, because it is the most likely to provoke an immune system response of the five main Rh antigens. It is common for D-negative individuals not to have any anti-D IgG or IgM antibodies, because anti-D antibodies are not usually produced by sensitization against environmental substances. However, D-negative individuals can produce IgG anti-D antibodies following a sensitizing event: possibly a fetomaternal transfusion of blood from a fetus in pregnancy or occasionally a blood transfusion with D positive RBCs. Rh disease can develop in these cases. Rh negative blood types are much less common in Asian populations (0.3%) than they are in European populations (15%).

The presence or absence of the Rh(D) antigen is signified by the + or − sign, so that, for example, the A− group is ABO type A and does not have the Rh (D) antigen.

===ABO and Rh distribution by country===
As with many other genetic traits, the distribution of ABO and Rh blood groups varies significantly between populations. While theories are still debated in the scientific community as to why blood types vary geographically and why they emerged in the first place, evidence suggests that the evolution of blood types may be driven by genetic selection for those types whose antigens confer resistance to particular diseases in certain regions – such as the prevalence of blood type O in malaria-endemic countries where individuals of blood type O exhibit the highest rates of survival.

===Other blood group systems===

 42 blood-group systems have been identified by the International Society for Blood Transfusion in addition to the ABO and Rh systems. Thus, in addition to the ABO antigens and Rh antigens, many other antigens are expressed on the RBC surface membrane. For example, an individual can be AB, D positive, and at the same time M and N positive (MNS system), K positive (Kell system), Lea or Leb negative (Lewis system), and so on, being positive or negative for each blood group system antigen. Many of the blood group systems were named after the patients in whom the corresponding antibodies were initially encountered. Blood group systems other than ABO and Rh pose a potential, yet relatively low, risk of complications upon mixing of blood from different people.

Following is a comparison of clinically relevant characteristics of antibodies against the main human blood group systems:
==Clinical significance==

===Blood transfusion===

Transfusion medicine is a specialized branch of hematology that is concerned with the study of blood groups, along with the work of a blood bank to provide a transfusion service for blood and other blood products. Across the world, blood products must be prescribed by a medical doctor (licensed physician or surgeon) in a similar way as medicines.

Much of the routine work of a blood bank involves testing blood from both donors and recipients to ensure that every individual recipient is given blood that is compatible and as safe as possible. If a unit of incompatible blood is transfused between a donor and recipient, a severe acute hemolytic reaction with hemolysis (RBC destruction), kidney failure and shock is likely to occur, and death is a possibility. Antibodies can be highly active and can attack RBCs and bind components of the complement system to cause massive hemolysis of the transfused blood.

Patients should ideally receive their own blood or type-specific blood products to minimize the chance of a transfusion reaction. It is also possible to use the patient&#x27;s own blood for transfusion. This is called autotransfusion, which is always compatible with the patient. The procedure of washing a patient&#x27;s own red blood cells goes as follows: The patient&#x27;s lost blood is collected and washed with a saline solution. The washing procedure yields concentrated washed red blood cells. The last step is reinfusing the packed red blood cells into the patient. There are multiple ways to wash red blood cells. The two main ways are centrifugation and filtration methods. This procedure can be performed with microfiltration devices like the Hemoclear filter. Risks can be further reduced by cross-matching blood, but this may be skipped when blood is required for an emergency. Cross-matching involves mixing a sample of the recipient&#x27;s serum with a sample of the donor&#x27;s red blood cells and checking if the mixture &quot;agglutinates&quot;, or forms clumps. If agglutination is not obvious by direct vision, blood bank technologist usually check for agglutination with a microscope. If agglutination occurs, that particular donor&#x27;s blood cannot be transfused to that particular recipient. In a blood bank it is vital that all blood specimens are correctly identified, so labelling has been standardized using a barcode system known as ISBT 128.

The blood group may be included on identification tags or on tattoos worn by military personnel, in case they should need an emergency blood transfusion. Frontline German Waffen-SS had blood group tattoos during World War II.

Rare blood types can cause supply problems for blood banks and hospitals. For example, Duffy-negative blood occurs much more frequently in people of African origin, and the rarity of this blood type in the rest of the population can result in a shortage of Duffy-negative blood for these patients. Similarly, for RhD negative people there is a risk associated with travelling to parts of the world where supplies of RhD negative blood are rare, particularly East Asia, where blood services may endeavor to encourage Westerners to donate blood.

===Hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN)===

A pregnant woman may carry a fetus with a blood type which is different from her own. Typically, this is an issue if a Rh- mother has a child with a Rh+ father, and the fetus ends up being Rh+ like the father. In those cases, the mother can make IgG blood group antibodies. This can happen if some of the fetus&#x27; blood cells pass into the mother&#x27;s blood circulation (e.g. a small fetomaternal hemorrhage at the time of childbirth or obstetric intervention), or sometimes after a therapeutic blood transfusion. This can cause Rh disease or other forms of hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) in the current pregnancy and/or subsequent pregnancies. Sometimes this is lethal for the fetus; in these cases it is called hydrops fetalis. If a pregnant woman is known to have anti-D antibodies, the Rh blood type of a fetus can be tested by analysis of fetal DNA in maternal plasma to assess the risk to the fetus of Rh disease. One of the major advances of twentieth century medicine was to prevent this disease by stopping the formation of Anti-D antibodies by D negative mothers with an injectable medication called Rho(D) immune globulin. Antibodies associated with some blood groups can cause severe HDN, others can only cause mild HDN and others are not known to cause HDN.

=== Blood products ===
To provide maximum benefit from each blood donation and to extend shelf-life, blood banks fractionate some whole blood into several products. The most common of these products are packed RBCs, plasma, platelets, cryoprecipitate, and fresh frozen plasma (FFP). FFP is quick-frozen to retain the labile clotting factors V and VIII, which are usually administered to patients who have a potentially fatal clotting problem caused by a condition such as advanced liver disease, overdose of anticoagulant, or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

Units of packed red cells are made by removing as much of the plasma as possible from whole blood units.

Clotting factors synthesized by modern recombinant methods are now in routine clinical use for hemophilia, as the risks of infection transmission that occur with pooled blood products are avoided.

===Red blood cell compatibility===
* Blood group AB individuals have both A and B antigens on the surface of their RBCs, and their blood plasma does not contain any antibodies against either A or B antigen. Therefore, an individual with type AB blood can receive blood from any group (with AB being preferable), but cannot donate blood to any group other than AB. They are known as universal recipients.
* Blood group A individuals have the A antigen on the surface of their RBCs, and blood serum containing IgM antibodies against the B antigen. Therefore, a group A individual can receive blood only from individuals of groups A or O (with A being preferable), and can donate blood to individuals with type A or AB.
* Blood group B individuals have the B antigen on the surface of their RBCs, and blood serum containing IgM antibodies against the A antigen. Therefore, a group B individual can receive blood only from individuals of groups B or O (with B being preferable), and can donate blood to individuals with type B or AB.
* Blood group O (or blood group zero in some countries) individuals do not have either A or B antigens on the surface of their RBCs, and their blood serum contains IgM anti-A and anti-B antibodies. Therefore, a group O individual can receive blood only from a group O individual, but can donate blood to individuals of any ABO blood group (i.e., A, B, O or AB). If a patient needs an urgent blood transfusion, and if the time taken to process the recipient&#x27;s blood would cause a detrimental delay, O negative blood can be used. Because it is compatible with anyone, there are some concerns that O negative blood is often overused and consequently is always in short supply. According to the American Association of Blood Banks and the British Chief Medical Officer&#x27;s National Blood Transfusion Committee, the use of group O RhD negative red cells should be restricted to persons with O negative blood, women who might be pregnant, and emergency cases in which blood-group testing is genuinely impracticable.

An Rh D-negative patient who does not have any anti-D antibodies (never being previously sensitized to D-positive RBCs) can receive a transfusion of D-positive blood once, but this would cause sensitization to the D antigen, and a female patient would become at risk for hemolytic disease of the newborn. If a D-negative patient has developed anti-D antibodies, a subsequent exposure to D-positive blood would lead to a potentially dangerous transfusion reaction. Rh D-positive blood should never be given to D-negative women of child-bearing age or to patients with D antibodies, so blood banks must conserve Rh-negative blood for these patients. In extreme circumstances, such as for a major bleed when stocks of D-negative blood units are very low at the blood bank, D-positive blood might be given to D-negative females above child-bearing age or to Rh-negative males, providing that they did not have anti-D antibodies, to conserve D-negative blood stock in the blood bank. The converse is not true; Rh D-positive patients do not react to D negative blood.

This same matching is done for other antigens of the Rh system as C, c, E and e and for other blood group systems with a known risk for immunization such as the Kell system in particular for females of child-bearing age or patients with known need for many transfusions.

===Plasma compatibility===

Blood plasma compatibility is the inverse of red blood cell compatibility. Type AB plasma carries neither anti-A nor anti-B antibodies and can be transfused to individuals of any blood group; but type AB patients can only receive type AB plasma. Type O carries both antibodies, so individuals of blood group O can receive plasma from any blood group, but type O plasma can be used only by type O recipients.


Rh D antibodies are uncommon, so generally neither D negative nor D positive blood contain anti-D antibodies. If a potential donor is found to have anti-D antibodies or any strong atypical blood group antibody by antibody screening in the blood bank, they would not be accepted as a donor (or in some blood banks the blood would be drawn but the product would need to be appropriately labeled); therefore, donor blood plasma issued by a blood bank can be selected to be free of D antibodies and free of other atypical antibodies, and such donor plasma issued from a blood bank would be suitable for a recipient who may be D positive or D negative, as long as blood plasma and the recipient are ABO compatible.

===Universal donors and universal recipients===
In transfusions of packed red blood cells, individuals with type O Rh D negative blood are often called universal donors. Those with type AB Rh D positive blood are called universal recipients. However, these terms are only generally true with respect to possible reactions of the recipient&#x27;s anti-A and anti-B antibodies to transfused red blood cells, and also possible sensitization to Rh D antigens. One exception is individuals with hh antigen system (also known as the Bombay phenotype) who can only receive blood safely from other hh donors, because they form antibodies against the H antigen present on all red blood cells.

Blood donors with exceptionally strong anti-A, anti-B or any atypical blood group antibody may be excluded from blood donation. In general, while the plasma fraction of a blood transfusion may carry donor antibodies not found in the recipient, a significant reaction is unlikely because of dilution.

Additionally, red blood cell surface antigens other than A, B and Rh D, might cause adverse reactions and sensitization, if they can bind to the corresponding antibodies to generate an immune response. Transfusions are further complicated because platelets and white blood cells (WBCs) have their own systems of surface antigens, and sensitization to platelet or WBC antigens can occur as a result of transfusion.

For transfusions of plasma, this situation is reversed. Type O plasma, containing both anti-A and anti-B antibodies, can only be given to O recipients. The antibodies will attack the antigens on any other blood type. Conversely, AB plasma can be given to patients of any ABO blood group, because it does not contain any anti-A or anti-B antibodies.

==Blood typing==

Typically, blood type tests are performed through addition of a blood sample to a solution containing antibodies corresponding to each antigen. The presence of an antigen on the surface of the blood cells is indicated by agglutination.

===Blood group genotyping===
In addition to the current practice of serologic testing of blood types, the progress in molecular diagnostics allows the increasing use of blood group genotyping. In contrast to serologic tests reporting a direct blood type phenotype, genotyping allows the prediction of a phenotype based on the knowledge of the molecular basis of the currently known antigens. This allows a more detailed determination of the blood type and therefore a better match for transfusion, which can be crucial in particular for patients with needs for many transfusions to prevent allo-immunization.

==History==
Blood types were first discovered by an Austrian physician, Karl Landsteiner, working at the Pathological-Anatomical Institute of the University of Vienna (now Medical University of Vienna). In 1900, he found that blood sera from different persons would clump together (agglutinate) when mixed in test tubes, and not only that, some human blood also agglutinated with animal blood. He wrote a two-sentence footnote:

This was the first evidence that blood variation exists in humans. The next year, in 1901, he made a definitive observation that blood serum of an individual would agglutinate with only those of certain individuals. Based on this he classified human bloods into three groups, namely group A, group B, and group C. He defined that group A blood agglutinates with group B, but never with its own type. Similarly, group B blood agglutinates with group A. Group C blood is different in that it agglutinates with both A and B. This was the discovery of blood groups for which Landsteiner was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1930. (C was later renamed to O after the German &quot;Ohne&quot;, meaning without, or zero, or null.) Another group (later named AB) was discovered a year later by Landsteiner&#x27;s students Adriano Sturli and Alfred von Decastello without designating the name (simply referring it to as &quot;no particular type&quot;). Thus, after Landsteiner, three blood types were initially recognised, namely A, B, and C.

Czech serologist Jan Janský was the first to recognise and designate four blood types in 1907 that he published in a local journal, using the Roman numerical I, II, III, and IV (corresponding to modern O, A, B, and AB respectively). Unknown to Janský, American physician William L. Moss introduced an almost identical classification in 1910, but with Moss&#x27;s I and IV corresponding to Janský&#x27;s IV and I. Thus the existence of two systems immediately created confusion and potential danger in medical practice. Moss&#x27;s system was adopted in Britain, France, and the US, while Janský&#x27;s was preferred in most other European countries and some parts of the US. It was reported that &quot;The practically universal use of the Moss classification at that time was completely and purposely cast aside. Therefore in place of bringing order out of chaos, chaos was increased in the larger cities.&quot; To resolve the confusion, the American Association of Immunologists, the Society of American Bacteriologists, and the Association of Pathologists and Bacteriologists made a joint recommendation in 1921 that the Jansky classification be adopted based on priority. But it was not followed particularly where Moss&#x27;s system had been used.

In 1927, Landsteiner, who had moved to the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research in New York, and as a member of a committee of the National Research Council concerned with blood grouping suggested to substitute Janský&#x27;s and Moss&#x27;s systems with the letters O, A, B, and AB, first introduced by Polish physician Ludwik Hirszfeld and German physician Emil von Dungern. There was another confusion on the use of O which was introduced in 1910. It was never clear whether it was meant for the figure 0, German &quot;null&quot; for zero or the upper case letter O for &quot;ohne&quot;, meaning without; Landsteiner chose the letter.

In 1928 the Permanent Commission on Biological Standardization adopted Landsteiner&#x27;s proposal and stated:This classification became widely accepted and after the early 1950s it was universally followed.

Hirszfeld and Dungern discovered the inheritance of blood types as Mendelian genetics in 1910 and the existence of sub-types of A in 1911. In 1927, Landsteiner, with Philip Levine, discovered the MN blood group system, and the P system. Development of the Coombs test in 1945, the advent of transfusion medicine, and the understanding of ABO hemolytic disease of the newborn led to discovery of more blood groups. , the International Society of Blood Transfusion (ISBT) recognizes 47 blood groups.

==Society and culture==

A popular pseudoscientific belief in Eastern Asian countries (especially in Japan and South Korea) known as 血液型 &quot;ketsuekigata / hyeoraekhyeong&quot; is that a person&#x27;s ABO blood type is predictive of their personality, character, and compatibility with others. Researchers have established no scientific basis exists for blood type personality categorization, and studies have found no &quot;significant relationship between personality and blood type, rendering the theory &#x27;obsolete&#x27; and concluding that no basis exists to assume that personality is anything more than randomly associated with blood type.&quot;

<text>Seattle Wireless was an American non-profit project created by Matt Westervelt and Ken Caruso in June 2000. It sought to develop a free, locally owned wireless community network using widely available, license-free technology wireless broadband Internet access. It is a metropolitan area network. As of 2016, Seattle Wireless is no longer operational.

Seattle Wireless was one of the first Community Wireless Networks and one of the first project focused wikis. It also had a short lived (7 episode) online television show, called Seattle Wireless TV. It was created by Peter Yorke and Michael Pierce and ran July 2003 - June 2004. SWTV was an early adopter of Bittorrent to distribute its shows.

<doc id="55312" wikidata="Q1110" url="?curid=55312" title="United Federation of Planets">
<text>In the fictional universe of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, the United Federation of Planets (UFP) is the interstellar government with which, as part of its space force Starfleet, most of the characters and starships of the franchise are affiliated. Commonly referred to as &quot;the Federation&quot;, it was introduced in the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; television series. The survival, success, and growth of the Federation and its principles of freedom have become some of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise&#x27;s central themes.

The Federation is an organization of numerous planetary sovereignties, including Earth and Vulcan. The franchise focuses on Starfleet, the exploration and defense arm of the Federation, rather than the government. Viewers are rarely given details of the internal workings of the government; however, many episodes refer to the rules and laws that the Federation imposes on the characters and their adventures.

==Development==
Early in the first season of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, Captain Kirk had said the &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s authority came from the United Earth Space Probe Agency. Bases visited in the series were labeled &quot;Earth Outposts&quot;. In August 1966, Gene L. Coon was hired by Gene Roddenberry as a writer for &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Actor William Shatner credits Coon with injecting the concepts of Starfleet, Starfleet Command and the United Federation of Planets into the show. One of the first teleplays Coon was credited with was &quot;A Taste of Armageddon&quot;, where an ambassador on the &quot;Enterprise&quot; is referred to as a Federation official.

Eventually, the series became an allegory for the current events of the 1960s counterculture, placing great emphasis on an anti-war message and depicting the United Federation of Planets, a vast interstellar alliance founded on the enlightened principles of liberty, equality, justice, progress, and peaceful co-existence, as an idealistic version of the United Nations.

==Reception==
The optimistic view of the future present in the Federation has been highlighted as unique among most science fiction, showing how &quot;evolved&quot; and &quot;civilized&quot; the future could conceivably be. Much debate has centered on how the materialist application of a post-scarcity economy in the Federation is incompatible with its own idealist ethics. It has been described, along with the series as a whole, as a vehicle to explore what it means to be human, as well as exploring mankind&#x27;s efforts to build a better society. Other writers have noted that &quot;Star Trek&quot;″s Federation has the same logistical and philosophical difficulties of other utopian economic and political schemes that make it seem unrealistic. However, Star Trek has brought up this idea of slavery or coerced service labor being necessary for its utopian society in &quot;The Measure of a Man&quot;, where Captain Jean-Luc Picard successfully defends Data&#x27;s right to resign from Starfleet in a trial of his sentience, which extends the right not to work to robots alongside all other sentient beings following the in-universe year 42523.7 (2365 AD.).

In 2020, &quot;Screen Rant&quot; noted the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; episode &quot;First Contact&quot; for exploring the United Federation of Planets and how it sometimes struggles with contact with aliens.

== In-universe portrayal ==
Like many things in &quot;Star Trek&quot;, episodes and films may reference entities or laws within the Federation, but viewers are never given a broad view of its inner workings. Many contemporary terms are assigned to the Federation, but parallels to current government bodies and their roles and responsibilities are pure speculation on the part of fans and critics.

In the timeline of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, the Federation was founded in 2161, after the events of &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; but before those of the other series in the franchise. Its founding members were Earth, Vulcan, Andoria, and Tellar. Over time it has expanded to include many more worlds through peaceful voluntary association. Some notable ones include Trill, Betazed, and Bolarus IX. References to the size of the Federation vary, with Captain Kirk stating in 2267 that humanity was on &quot;a thousand planets and spreading out&quot;, while Captain Picard referred to the Federation (in 2373) as being made up of &quot;over one hundred and fifty&quot; planets, spread across 8,000 light-years. The Federation is a major galactic power, and at various times has been at war with other powers such as the Klingons, the Romulans and the Dominion. The Federation&#x27;s space force is called Starfleet, and, although most of &quot;Star Trek&quot; depicts peaceful exploration of the galaxy, Starfleet is also capable of considerable military might. Section 31 is a paramilitary espionage agency, described by writer Ira Steven Behr as &quot;...doing the nasty stuff that no one wants to think about.&quot;.

The Federation is depicted as a democratic republic, led by a President based in Paris on Earth. Presidential powers include issuing pardons and declaring states of emergency. This president is supported by a cabinet. The Federation also has a supreme court and a legislature, the Federation Council, with delegates from its various member worlds. A constitution and a charter have both been referred to as founding documents of the Federation.

Several planets are shown to desire Federation membership. Joining the Federation is a complicated process, and requires meeting various criteria. Disqualifying criteria include caste-based discrimination and violations of sentient rights. A single, unified government is not required for admission, but is desirable. Most Starfleet personnel are Federation citizens. Non-citizens can join Starfleet, but the process is more difficult, as with all non-Federation races.

The Federation&#x27;s counterpart in the Mirror Universe is the Terran Empire, a human-dominated authoritarian state which has formed an empire by conquest.

==Future of the Federation==
In the &quot;Short Treks&quot; episode &quot;Calypso&quot;, taking place at an unknown time in the distant future, the character of Craft refers to the &quot;V&#x27;draysh&quot;. Little is said about the V&#x27;draysh, except that it is at war with Alcor IV, and that the V&#x27;draysh people are searching for artifacts from ancient human history. The writer of this episode, Michael Chabon, stated that the name &quot;V&#x27;draysh&quot; is intended to be a syncope for the word &quot;Federation&quot;.

In the 32nd century setting of the third season of &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot;, the Federation had undergone a near-total collapse precipitated by &quot;The Burn&quot;, a galaxy-wide disaster. This shrunk the Federation from a peak of 350 worlds to just 38, notably excluding both Earth and Ni&#x27;Var (formerly known as Vulcan). During the fourth season, the Federation is in the process of rebuilding itself; Starfleet Academy is reopened, new shipbuilding facilities are commissioned, and many former member worlds such as Trill, Ni&#x27;Var and Earth rejoin.

==Non-canon references==

In non-canon sources like the original 1975 &quot;Star Trek Star Fleet Technical Manual&quot;, Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Worlds of the Federation&quot;, and roleplaying games, the Federation&#x27;s five founding members were Earth (or Terra), Vulcan, Tellar, Andor, and Alpha Centauri. Some non-canon works assert that founding member Alpha Centauri is home to a human race (transplanted by the Preservers from classical third-century BC Greece) known as, variously, Centaurans, Centaurians, or Centauri.

The 1980-to-2188 historical guide &quot;Star Trek Spaceflight Chronology&quot; posits the Federation as being incorporated at &#x27;the first Babel Interplanetary Conference&#x27; in 2087.

In books such as the &quot;Star Trek Star Fleet Technical Manual&quot; and the novel &quot;Articles of the Federation&quot;, the Federation&#x27;s founding document is the Articles of Federation.

<doc id="55313" wikidata="Q42982" url="?curid=55313" title="Allergy">
<text>Allergies, also known as allergic diseases, are various conditions caused by hypersensitivity of the immune system to typically harmless substances in the environment. These diseases include hay fever, food allergies, atopic dermatitis, allergic asthma, and anaphylaxis. Symptoms may include red eyes, an itchy rash, sneezing, coughing, a runny nose, shortness of breath, or swelling. Note that food intolerances and food poisoning are separate conditions.
Common allergens include pollen and certain foods. Metals and other substances may also cause such problems. Food, insect stings, and medications are common causes of severe reactions. Their development is due to both genetic and environmental factors. The underlying mechanism involves immunoglobulin E antibodies (IgE), part of the body&#x27;s immune system, binding to an allergen and then to a receptor on mast cells or basophils where it triggers the release of inflammatory chemicals such as histamine. Diagnosis is typically based on a person&#x27;s medical history. Further testing of the skin or blood may be useful in certain cases. Positive tests, however, may not necessarily mean there is a significant allergy to the substance in question.
Early exposure of children to potential allergens may be protective. Treatments for allergies include avoidance of known allergens and the use of medications such as steroids and antihistamines. In severe reactions, injectable adrenaline (epinephrine) is recommended. Allergen immunotherapy, which gradually exposes people to larger and larger amounts of allergen, is useful for some types of allergies such as hay fever and reactions to insect bites. Its use in food allergies is unclear.
Allergies are common. In the developed world, about 20% of people are affected by allergic rhinitis, food allergy affects 10% of adults and 8% of children, and about 20% have or have had atopic dermatitis at some point in time. Depending on the country, about 1–18% of people have asthma. Anaphylaxis occurs in between 0.05–2% of people. Rates of many allergic diseases appear to be increasing. The word &quot;allergy&quot; was first used by Clemens von Pirquet in 1906.

==Signs and symptoms==

Many allergens such as dust or pollen are airborne particles. In these cases, symptoms arise in areas in contact with air, such as the eyes, nose, and lungs. For instance, allergic rhinitis, also known as hay fever, causes irritation of the nose, sneezing, itching, and redness of the eyes. Inhaled allergens can also lead to increased production of mucus in the lungs, shortness of breath, coughing, and wheezing.

Aside from these ambient allergens, allergic reactions can result from foods, insect stings, and reactions to medications like aspirin and antibiotics such as penicillin. Symptoms of food allergy include abdominal pain, bloating, vomiting, diarrhea, itchy skin, and hives. Food allergies rarely cause respiratory (asthmatic) reactions, or rhinitis. Insect stings, food, antibiotics, and certain medicines may produce a systemic allergic response that is also called anaphylaxis; multiple organ systems can be affected, including the digestive system, the respiratory system, and the circulatory system. Depending on the severity, anaphylaxis can include skin reactions, bronchoconstriction, swelling, low blood pressure, coma, and death. This type of reaction can be triggered suddenly, or the onset can be delayed. The nature of anaphylaxis is such that the reaction can seem to be subsiding but may recur throughout a period of time.

===Skin===
Substances that come into contact with the skin, such as latex, are also common causes of allergic reactions, known as contact dermatitis or eczema. Skin allergies frequently cause rashes, or swelling and inflammation within the skin, in what is known as a &quot;weal and flare&quot; reaction characteristic of hives and angioedema.

With insect stings, a large local reaction may occur in the form of an area of skin redness greater than 10 cm in size that can last one to two days. This reaction may also occur after immunotherapy.

The way our body responds to foreign invaders on the molecular level is similar to how our allergens are treated even on the skin. Our skin forms an effective barrier to the entry of most allergens but this barrier cannot withstand everything that comes at it because at the end of the day, it is only our skin. A situation such as an insect sting can breach the barrier and inject allergen to the affected spot. When an allergen enters the epidermis or dermis, it triggers a localized allergic reaction which activates the mast cells in the skin resulting in an immediate increase in vascular permeability, leading to fluid leakage and swelling in the affected area. Mast-cell activation also stimulates a skin lesion called the wheal-and-flare reaction. This is when the release of chemicals from local nerve endings by a nerve axon reflex, causes the vasodilatations of surrounding cutaneous blood vessels, which causes redness of the surrounding skin.

As a part of the allergy response, our body has developed a secondary response which in some individuals causes a more widespread and sustained edematous response. This usually occurs about 8 hours after the allergen originally comes in contact with the skin. When an allergen is ingested, a dispersed form of wheal-and-flare reaction, known as urticaria or hives will appear when the allergen enters the bloodstream and eventually reaches the skin. The way our skin reacts to different allergens gives allergists the upper hand and allows them to test for allergies by injecting a very small amount of an allergen into the skin. Even though these injections are very small and local, they still pose the risk of causing systematic anaphylaxis.

==Cause==
Risk factors for allergies can be placed in two broad categories, namely host and environmental factors. Host factors include heredity, sex, race, and age, with heredity being by far the most significant. However, there has been a recent increase in the incidence of allergic disorders that cannot be explained by genetic factors alone. Four major environmental candidates are alterations in exposure to infectious diseases during early childhood, environmental pollution, allergen levels, and dietary changes.

===Dust mites===
Dust mite allergy, also known as house dust allergy, is a sensitization and allergic reaction to the droppings of house dust mites. The allergy is common and can trigger allergic reactions such as asthma, eczema, or itching. The mite&#x27;s gut contains potent digestive enzymes (notably peptidase 1) that persist in their feces and are major inducers of allergic reactions such as wheezing. The mite&#x27;s exoskeleton can also contribute to allergic reactions. Unlike scabies mites or skin follicle mites, house dust mites do not burrow under the skin and are not parasitic.

===Foods===

A wide variety of foods can cause allergic reactions, but 90% of allergic responses to foods are caused by cow&#x27;s milk, soy, eggs, wheat, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, and shellfish. Other food allergies, affecting less than 1 person per 10,000 population, may be considered &quot;rare&quot;. The most common food allergy in the US population is a sensitivity to crustacea. Although peanut allergies are notorious for their severity, peanut allergies are not the most common food allergy in adults or children. Severe or life-threatening reactions may be triggered by other allergens and are more common when combined with asthma.

Rates of allergies differ between adults and children. Children can sometimes outgrow peanut allergies. Egg allergies affect one to two percent of children but are outgrown by about two-thirds of children by the age of 5. The sensitivity is usually to proteins in the white, rather than the yolk.

Milk-protein allergies—distinct from lactose intolerance—are most common in children. Approximately 60% of milk-protein reactions are immunoglobulin E–mediated, with the remaining usually attributable to inflammation of the colon. Some people are unable to tolerate milk from goats or sheep as well as from cows, and many are also unable to tolerate dairy products such as cheese. Roughly 10% of children with a milk allergy will have a reaction to beef. Lactose intolerance, a common reaction to milk, is not a form of allergy at all, but due to the absence of an enzyme in the digestive tract.

Those with tree nut allergies may be allergic to one or many tree nuts, including pecans, pistachios, and walnuts. In addition, seeds, including sesame seeds and poppy seeds, contain oils in which protein is present, which may elicit an allergic reaction.

Allergens can be transferred from one food to another through genetic engineering; however, genetic modification can also remove allergens. Little research has been done on the natural variation of allergen concentrations in unmodified crops.

===Latex===
Latex can trigger an IgE-mediated cutaneous, respiratory, and systemic reaction. The prevalence of latex allergy in the general population is believed to be less than one percent. In a hospital study, 1 in 800 surgical patients (0.125 percent) reported latex sensitivity, although the sensitivity among healthcare workers is higher, between seven and ten percent. Researchers attribute this higher level to the exposure of healthcare workers to areas with significant airborne latex allergens, such as operating rooms, intensive-care units, and dental suites. These latex-rich environments may sensitize healthcare workers who regularly inhale allergenic proteins.

The most prevalent response to latex is an allergic contact dermatitis, a delayed hypersensitive reaction appearing as dry, crusted lesions. This reaction usually lasts 48–96 hours. Sweating or rubbing the area under the glove aggravates the lesions, possibly leading to ulcerations. Anaphylactic reactions occur most often in sensitive patients who have been exposed to a surgeon&#x27;s latex gloves during abdominal surgery, but other mucosal exposures, such as dental procedures, can also produce systemic reactions.

Latex and banana sensitivity may cross-react. Furthermore, those with latex allergy may also have sensitivities to avocado, kiwifruit, and chestnut. These people often have perioral itching and local urticaria. Only occasionally have these food-induced allergies induced systemic responses. Researchers suspect that the cross-reactivity of latex with banana, avocado, kiwifruit, and chestnut occurs because latex proteins are structurally homologous with some other plant proteins.

===Medications===
About 10% of people report that they are allergic to penicillin; however, of that 10%, 90% turn out not to be. Serious allergies only occur in about 0.03%.

===Insect stings===

One of the main sources of human allergies is insects. An allergy to insects can be brought on by bites, stings, ingestion, and inhalation.

===Toxins interacting with proteins===
Another non-food protein reaction, urushiol-induced contact dermatitis, originates after contact with poison ivy, eastern poison oak, western poison oak, or poison sumac. Urushiol, which is not itself a protein, acts as a hapten and chemically reacts with, binds to, and changes the shape of integral membrane proteins on exposed skin cells. The immune system does not recognize the affected cells as normal parts of the body, causing a T-cell-mediated immune response.

Of these poisonous plants, sumac is the most virulent. The resulting dermatological response to the reaction between urushiol and membrane proteins includes redness, swelling, papules, vesicles, blisters, and streaking.

Estimates vary on the population fraction that will have an immune system response. Approximately 25% of the population will have a strong allergic response to urushiol. In general, approximately 80–90% of adults will develop a rash if they are exposed to of purified urushiol, but some people are so sensitive that it takes only a molecular trace on the skin to initiate an allergic reaction.

===Genetics===
Allergic diseases are strongly familial; identical twins are likely to have the same allergic diseases about 70% of the time; the same allergy occurs about 40% of the time in non-identical twins. Allergic parents are more likely to have allergic children and those children&#x27;s allergies are likely to be more severe than those in children of non-allergic parents. Some allergies, however, are not consistent along genealogies; parents who are allergic to peanuts may have children who are allergic to ragweed. The likelihood of developing allergies is inherited and related to an irregularity in the immune system, but the specific allergen is not.

The risk of allergic sensitization and the development of allergies varies with age, with young children most at risk. Several studies have shown that IgE levels are highest in childhood and fall rapidly between the ages of 10 and 30 years. The peak prevalence of hay fever is highest in children and young adults and the incidence of asthma is highest in children under 10.

Ethnicity may play a role in some allergies; however, racial factors have been difficult to separate from environmental influences and changes due to migration. It has been suggested that different genetic loci are responsible for asthma, to be specific, in people of European, Hispanic, Asian, and African origins.

When we think about how different we all look and perceive our surroundings, it becomes unimaginable to think about how different all the ways we are different on the molecular level. Everything from how we react to foreign bodies to how we respond to those bodies and why. This is all because of our genetic markup; our DNA, which is made up of genes that encode for specific molecules or whole complexes. Due to the variability in responses and how the disease manifests differently in individuals, a clear genetic basis for the predisposition and severity of allergic diseases has not yet been fully established. A lot of what causes the allergy is the way our body extremely reacts to the environment so the genes that cause these things are related to regulation of molecules.

Researchers have worked to characterize genes involved in inflammation and the maintenance of mucosal integrity. The identified genes associated with allergic disease severity, progression, and development primarily function in four areas: regulating inflammatory responses (IFN-α, TLR-1, IL-13, IL-4, IL-5, HLA-G, iNOS), maintaining vascular endothelium and mucosal lining (FLG, PLAUR, CTNNA3, PDCH1, COL29A1), mediating immune cell function (PHF11, H1R, HDC, TSLP, STAT6, RERE, PPP2R3C), and influencing susceptibility to allergic sensitization (e.g., ORMDL3, CHI3L1).

Multiple studies have investigated the genetic profiles of individuals with predispositions to and experiences of allergic diseases, revealing a complex polygenic architecture. Specific genetic loci, such as MIIP, CXCR4, SCML4, CYP1B1, ICOS, and LINC00824, have been directly associated with allergic disorders. Additionally, some loci show pleiotropic effects, linking them to both autoimmune and allergic conditions, including PRDM2, G3BP1, HBS1L, and POU2AF1. These genes engage in shared inflammatory pathways across various epithelial tissues—such as the skin, esophagus, vagina, and lung—highlighting common genetic factors that contribute to the pathogenesis of asthma and other allergic diseases.

In atopic patients, transcriptome studies have identified IL-13-related pathways as key for eosinophilic airway inflammation and remodeling. That causes the body to experience the type of airflow restriction of allergic asthma. Expression of genes was quite variable: genes associated with inflammation were found almost exclusively in superficial airways, while genes related to airway remodeling were mainly present in endobronchial biopsy specimens. This enhanced gene profile was similar across multiple sample sizes – nasal brushing, sputum, endobronchial brushing – demonstrating the importance of eosinophilic inflammation, mast cell degranulation and group 3 innate lymphoid cells in severe adult-onset asthma. IL-13 is an immunoregulatory cytokine that is made mostly by activated T-helper 2 (Th2) cells. It is an important cytokine for many steps in B-cell maturation and differentiation, since it increases CD23 and MHC class II molecules, and aids in B-cell isotype switching to IgE. IL-13 also suppresses macrophage function by reducing the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The more striking thing is that IL-13 is the prime mover in allergen-induced asthma via pathways that are independent of IgE and eosinophils.

===Hygiene hypothesis===

Allergic diseases are caused by inappropriate immunological responses to harmless antigens driven by a TH2-mediated immune response. Many bacteria and viruses elicit a TH1-mediated immune response, which down-regulates TH2 responses. The first proposed mechanism of action of the hygiene hypothesis was that insufficient stimulation of the TH1 arm of the immune system leads to an overactive TH2 arm, which in turn leads to allergic disease. In other words, individuals living in too sterile an environment are not exposed to enough pathogens to keep the immune system busy. Since our bodies evolved to deal with a certain level of such pathogens, when they are not exposed to this level, the immune system will attack harmless antigens, and thus normally benign microbial objects—like pollen—will trigger an immune response.

The hygiene hypothesis was developed to explain the observation that hay fever and eczema, both allergic diseases, were less common in children from larger families, which were, it is presumed, exposed to more infectious agents through their siblings, than in children from families with only one child. It is used to explain the increase in allergic diseases that have been seen since industrialization, and the higher incidence of allergic diseases in more developed countries. The hygiene hypothesis has now expanded to include exposure to symbiotic bacteria and parasites as important modulators of immune system development, along with infectious agents.

Epidemiological data support the hygiene hypothesis. Studies have shown that various immunological and autoimmune diseases are much less common in the developing world than the industrialized world, and that immigrants to the industrialized world from the developing world increasingly develop immunological disorders in relation to the length of time since arrival in the industrialized world. Longitudinal studies in the third world demonstrate an increase in immunological disorders as a country grows more affluent and, it is presumed, cleaner. The use of antibiotics in the first year of life has been linked to asthma and other allergic diseases. The use of antibacterial cleaning products has also been associated with higher incidence of asthma, as has birth by caesarean section rather than vaginal birth.

===Stress===
Chronic stress can aggravate allergic conditions. This has been attributed to a T helper 2 (TH2)-predominant response driven by suppression of interleukin 12 by both the autonomic nervous system and the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis. Stress management in highly susceptible individuals may improve symptoms.

===Other environmental factors===
Allergic diseases are more common in industrialized countries than in countries that are more traditional or agricultural, and there is a higher rate of allergic disease in urban populations versus rural populations, although these differences are becoming less defined. Historically, the trees planted in urban areas were predominantly male to prevent litter from seeds and fruits, but the high ratio of male trees causes high pollen counts, a phenomenon that horticulturist Tom Ogren has called &quot;botanical sexism&quot;.

Alterations in exposure to microorganisms is another plausible explanation, at present, for the increase in atopic allergy. Endotoxin exposure reduces release of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IFNγ, interleukin-10, and interleukin-12 from white blood cells (leukocytes) that circulate in the blood. Certain microbe-sensing proteins, known as Toll-like receptors, found on the surface of cells in the body are also thought to be involved in these processes.

Parasitic worms and similar parasites are present in untreated drinking water in developing countries, and were present in the water of developed countries until the routine chlorination and purification of drinking water supplies. Recent research has shown that some common parasites, such as intestinal worms (e.g., hookworms), secrete chemicals into the gut wall (and, hence, the bloodstream) that suppress the immune system and prevent the body from attacking the parasite. This gives rise to a new slant on the hygiene hypothesis theory—that co-evolution of humans and parasites has led to an immune system that functions correctly only in the presence of the parasites. Without them, the immune system becomes unbalanced and oversensitive.

In particular, research suggests that allergies may coincide with the delayed establishment of gut flora in infants. However, the research to support this theory is conflicting, with some studies performed in China and Ethiopia showing an increase in allergy in people infected with intestinal worms. Clinical trials have been initiated to test the effectiveness of certain worms in treating some allergies. It may be that the term &#x27;parasite&#x27; could turn out to be inappropriate, and in fact a hitherto unsuspected symbiosis is at work. For more information on this topic, see Helminthic therapy.

==Pathophysiology==

===Acute response===

In the initial stages of allergy, a type I hypersensitivity reaction against an allergen encountered for the first time and presented by a professional antigen-presenting cell causes a response in a type of immune cell called a TH2 lymphocyte, a subset of T cells that produce a cytokine called interleukin-4 (IL-4). These TH2 cells interact with other lymphocytes called B cells, whose role is production of antibodies. Coupled with signals provided by IL-4, this interaction stimulates the B cell to begin production of a large amount of a particular type of antibody known as IgE. Secreted IgE circulates in the blood and binds to an IgE-specific receptor (a kind of Fc receptor called FcεRI) on the surface of other kinds of immune cells called mast cells and basophils, which are both involved in the acute inflammatory response. The IgE-coated cells, at this stage, are sensitized to the allergen.

If later exposure to the same allergen occurs, the allergen can bind to the IgE molecules held on the surface of the mast cells or basophils. Cross-linking of the IgE and Fc receptors occurs when more than one IgE-receptor complex interacts with the same allergenic molecule and activates the sensitized cell. Activated mast cells and basophils undergo a process called degranulation, during which they release histamine and other inflammatory chemical mediators (cytokines, interleukins, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins) from their granules into the surrounding tissue causing several systemic effects, such as vasodilation, mucous secretion, nerve stimulation, and smooth muscle contraction.

This results in rhinorrhea, itchiness, dyspnea, and anaphylaxis. Depending on the individual, allergen, and mode of introduction, the symptoms can be system-wide (classical anaphylaxis) or localized to specific body systems. Asthma is localized to the respiratory system and eczema is localized to the dermis.

===Late-phase response===
After the chemical mediators of the acute response subside, late-phase responses can often occur. This is due to the migration of other leukocytes such as neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils, and macrophages to the initial site. The reaction is usually seen 2–24 hours after the original reaction. Cytokines from mast cells may play a role in the persistence of long-term effects. Late-phase responses seen in asthma are slightly different from those seen in other allergic responses, although they are still caused by release of mediators from eosinophils and are still dependent on activity of TH2 cells.

===Allergic contact dermatitis===
Although allergic contact dermatitis is termed an &quot;allergic&quot; reaction (which usually refers to type I hypersensitivity), its pathophysiology involves a reaction that more correctly corresponds to a type IV hypersensitivity reaction. In type IV hypersensitivity, there is activation of certain types of T cells (CD8+) that destroy target cells on contact, as well as activated macrophages that produce hydrolytic enzymes.

==Diagnosis==

Effective management of allergic diseases relies on the ability to make an accurate diagnosis. Allergy testing can help confirm or rule out allergies. Correct diagnosis, counseling, and avoidance advice based on valid allergy test results reduce the incidence of symptoms and need for medications, and improve quality of life. To assess the presence of allergen-specific IgE antibodies, two different methods can be used: a skin prick test, or an allergy blood test. Both methods are recommended, and they have similar diagnostic value.

Skin prick tests and blood tests are equally cost-effective, and health economic evidence shows that both tests were cost-effective compared with no test. Early and more accurate diagnoses save cost due to reduced consultations, referrals to secondary care, misdiagnosis, and emergency admissions.

Allergy undergoes dynamic changes over time. Regular allergy testing of relevant allergens provides information on if and how patient management can be changed to improve health and quality of life. Annual testing is often the practice for determining whether allergy to milk, egg, soy, and wheat have been outgrown, and the testing interval is extended to 2–3 years for allergy to peanut, tree nuts, fish, and crustacean shellfish. Results of follow-up testing can guide decision-making regarding whether and when it is safe to introduce or re-introduce allergenic food into the diet.

===Skin prick testing===

Skin testing is also known as &quot;puncture testing&quot; and &quot;prick testing&quot; due to the series of tiny punctures or pricks made into the patient&#x27;s skin. Tiny amounts of suspected allergens and/or their extracts (&quot;e.g.&quot;, pollen, grass, mite proteins, peanut extract) are introduced to sites on the skin marked with pen or dye (the ink/dye should be carefully selected, lest it cause an allergic response itself). A negative and positive control are also included for comparison (eg, negative is saline or glycerin; positive is histamine). A small plastic or metal device is used to puncture or prick the skin. Sometimes, the allergens are injected &quot;intradermally&quot; into the patient&#x27;s skin, with a needle and syringe. Common areas for testing include the inside forearm and the back.

If the patient is allergic to the substance, then a visible inflammatory reaction will usually occur within 30 minutes. This response will range from slight reddening of the skin to a full-blown hive (called &quot;wheal and flare&quot;) in more sensitive patients similar to a mosquito bite. Interpretation of the results of the skin prick test is normally done by allergists on a scale of severity, with +/− meaning borderline reactivity, and 4+ being a large reaction. Increasingly, allergists are measuring and recording the diameter of the wheal and flare reaction. Interpretation by well-trained allergists is often guided by relevant literature.

In general, a positive response is interpreted when the wheal of an antigen is ≥3mm larger than the wheal of the negative control (eg, saline or glycerin). Some patients may believe they have determined their own allergic sensitivity from observation, but a skin test has been shown to be much better than patient observation to detect allergy.

If a serious life-threatening anaphylactic reaction has brought a patient in for evaluation, some allergists will prefer an initial blood test prior to performing the skin prick test. Skin tests may not be an option if the patient has widespread skin disease or has taken antihistamines in the last several days.

===Patch testing===
Patch testing is a method used to determine if a specific substance causes allergic inflammation of the skin. It tests for delayed reactions. It is used to help ascertain the cause of skin contact allergy or contact dermatitis. Adhesive patches, usually treated with several common allergic chemicals or skin sensitizers, are applied to the back. The skin is then examined for possible local reactions at least twice, usually at 48 hours after application of the patch, and again two or three days later.

===Blood testing===
An allergy blood test is quick and simple and can be ordered by a licensed health care provider (&quot;e.g.&quot;, an allergy specialist) or general practitioner. Unlike skin-prick testing, a blood test can be performed irrespective of age, skin condition, medication, symptom, disease activity, and pregnancy. Adults and children of any age can get an allergy blood test. For babies and very young children, a single needle stick for allergy blood testing is often gentler than several skin pricks.

An allergy blood test is available through most laboratories. A sample of the patient&#x27;s blood is sent to a laboratory for analysis, and the results are sent back a few days later. Multiple allergens can be detected with a single blood sample. Allergy blood tests are very safe since the person is not exposed to any allergens during the testing procedure. After the onset of anaphylaxis or a severe allergic reaction, guidelines recommend emergency departments obtain a time-sensitive blood test to determine blood tryptase levels and assess for mast cell activation.

The test measures the concentration of specific IgE antibodies in the blood. Quantitative IgE test results increase the possibility of ranking how different substances may affect symptoms. A rule of thumb is that the higher the IgE antibody value, the greater the likelihood of symptoms. Allergens found at low levels that today do not result in symptoms cannot help predict future symptom development. The quantitative allergy blood result can help determine what a patient is allergic to, help predict and follow the disease development, estimate the risk of a severe reaction, and explain cross-reactivity.

A low total IgE level is not adequate to rule out sensitization to commonly inhaled allergens. Statistical methods, such as ROC curves, predictive value calculations, and likelihood ratios have been used to examine the relationship of various testing methods to each other. These methods have shown that patients with a high total IgE have a high probability of allergic sensitization, but further investigation with allergy tests for specific IgE antibodies for a carefully chosen of allergens is often warranted.

Laboratory methods to measure specific IgE antibodies for allergy testing include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA, or EIA), radioallergosorbent test (RAST), fluorescent enzyme immunoassay (FEIA), and chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA).

===Other testing===
Challenge testing: Challenge testing is when tiny amounts of a suspected allergen are introduced to the body orally, through inhalation, or via other routes. Except for testing food and medication allergies, challenges are rarely performed. When this type of testing is chosen, it must be closely supervised by an allergist.

Elimination/challenge tests: This testing method is used most often with foods or medicines. A patient with a suspected allergen is instructed to modify his diet to totally avoid that allergen for a set time. If the patient experiences significant improvement, he may then be &quot;challenged&quot; by reintroducing the allergen, to see if symptoms are reproduced.

Unreliable tests: There are other types of allergy testing methods that are unreliable, including applied kinesiology (allergy testing through muscle relaxation), cytotoxicity testing, urine autoinjection, skin titration (Rinkel method), and provocative and neutralization (subcutaneous) testing or sublingual provocation.

===Differential diagnosis===
Before a diagnosis of allergic disease can be confirmed, other plausible causes of the presenting symptoms must be considered. Vasomotor rhinitis, for example, is one of many illnesses that share symptoms with allergic rhinitis, underscoring the need for professional differential diagnosis. Once a diagnosis of asthma, rhinitis, anaphylaxis, or other allergic disease has been made, there are several methods for discovering the causative agent of that allergy.

==Prevention==

Giving peanut products early in childhood may decrease the risk of allergies, and only breastfeeding during at least the first few months of life may decrease the risk of allergic dermatitis. There is little evidence that a mother&#x27;s diet during pregnancy or breastfeeding affects the risk of allergies, although there has been some research to show that irregular cow&#x27;s milk exposure might increase the risk of cow&#x27;s milk allergy. There is some evidence that delayed introduction of certain foods is useful, and that early exposure to potential allergens may actually be protective.

Fish oil supplementation during pregnancy is associated with a lower risk of food sensitivities. Probiotic supplements during pregnancy or infancy may help to prevent atopic dermatitis.

==Management==
Management of allergies typically involves avoiding the allergy trigger and taking medications to improve the symptoms. Allergen immunotherapy may be useful for some types of allergies.

===Medication===
Several medications may be used to block the action of allergic mediators, or to prevent activation of cells and degranulation processes. These include antihistamines, glucocorticoids, epinephrine (adrenaline), mast cell stabilizers, and antileukotriene agents are common treatments of allergic diseases. Anticholinergics, decongestants, and other compounds thought to impair eosinophil chemotaxis are also commonly used. Although rare, the severity of anaphylaxis often requires epinephrine injection, and where medical care is unavailable, a device known as an epinephrine autoinjector may be used.

===Immunotherapy===
Allergen immunotherapy is useful for environmental allergies, allergies to insect bites, and asthma. Its benefit for food allergies is unclear and thus not recommended. Immunotherapy involves exposing people to larger and larger amounts of allergen in an effort to change the immune system&#x27;s response.

Meta-analyses have found that injections of allergens under the skin is effective in the treatment in allergic rhinitis in children and in asthma. The benefits may last for years after treatment is stopped. It is generally safe and effective for allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis, allergic forms of asthma, and stinging insects.

To a lesser extent, the evidence also supports the use of sublingual immunotherapy for rhinitis and asthma. For seasonal allergies the benefit is small. In this form the allergen is given under the tongue and people often prefer it to injections. Immunotherapy is not recommended as a stand-alone treatment for asthma.

===Alternative medicine===
An experimental treatment, enzyme potentiated desensitization (EPD), has been tried for decades but is not generally accepted as effective. EPD uses dilutions of allergen and an enzyme, beta-glucuronidase, to which T-regulatory lymphocytes are supposed to respond by favoring desensitization, or down-regulation, rather than sensitization. EPD has also been tried for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, but evidence does not show effectiveness.

A review found no effectiveness of homeopathic treatments and no difference compared with placebo. The authors concluded that based on rigorous clinical trials of all types of homeopathy for childhood and adolescence ailments, there is no convincing evidence that supports the use of homeopathic treatments.

According to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, U.S., the evidence is relatively strong that saline nasal irrigation and butterbur are effective, when compared to other alternative medicine treatments, for which the scientific evidence is weak, negative, or nonexistent, such as honey, acupuncture, omega 3&#x27;s, probiotics, astragalus, capsaicin, grape seed extract, Pycnogenol, quercetin, spirulina, stinging nettle, tinospora, or guduchi.
==Epidemiology==
The allergic diseases—hay fever and asthma—have increased in the Western world over the past 2–3 decades. Increases in allergic asthma and other atopic disorders in industrialized nations, it is estimated, began in the 1960s and 1970s, with further increases occurring during the 1980s and 1990s, although some suggest that a steady rise in sensitization has been occurring since the 1920s. The number of new cases per year of atopy in developing countries has, in general, remained much lower.

===Changing frequency===
Although genetic factors govern susceptibility to atopic disease, increases in atopy have occurred within too short a period to be explained by a genetic change in the population, thus pointing to environmental or lifestyle changes. Several hypotheses have been identified to explain this increased rate. Increased exposure to perennial allergens may be due to housing changes and increased time spent indoors, and a decreased activation of a common immune control mechanism may be caused by changes in cleanliness or hygiene, and exacerbated by dietary changes, obesity, and decline in physical exercise. The hygiene hypothesis maintains that high living standards and hygienic conditions exposes children to fewer infections. It is thought that reduced bacterial and viral infections early in life direct the maturing immune system away from TH1 type responses, leading to unrestrained TH2 responses that allow for an increase in allergy.

Changes in rates and types of infection alone, however, have been unable to explain the observed increase in allergic disease, and recent evidence has focused attention on the importance of the gastrointestinal microbial environment. Evidence has shown that exposure to food and fecal-oral pathogens, such as hepatitis A, &quot;Toxoplasma gondii&quot;, and &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; (which also tend to be more prevalent in developing countries), can reduce the overall risk of atopy by more than 60%, and an increased rate of parasitic infections has been associated with a decreased prevalence of asthma. It is speculated that these infections exert their effect by critically altering TH1/TH2 regulation. Important elements of newer hygiene hypotheses also include exposure to endotoxins, exposure to pets and growing up on a farm.

==History==
Some symptoms attributable to allergic diseases are mentioned in ancient sources. Particularly, three members of the Roman Julio-Claudian dynasty (Augustus, Claudius and Britannicus) are suspected to have a family history of atopy. The concept of &quot;allergy&quot; was originally introduced in 1906 by the Viennese pediatrician Clemens von Pirquet, after he noticed that patients who had received injections of horse serum or smallpox vaccine usually had quicker, more severe reactions to second injections. Pirquet called this phenomenon &quot;allergy&quot; from the Ancient Greek words &quot;allos&quot; meaning &quot;other&quot; and &quot;ergon&quot; meaning &quot;work&quot;.

All forms of hypersensitivity used to be classified as allergies, and all were thought to be caused by an improper activation of the immune system. Later, it became clear that several different disease mechanisms were implicated, with a common link to a disordered activation of the immune system. In 1963, a new classification scheme was designed by Philip Gell and Robin Coombs that described four types of hypersensitivity reactions, known as Type I to Type IV hypersensitivity.

With this new classification, the word &quot;allergy&quot;, sometimes clarified as a &quot;true allergy&quot;, was restricted to type I hypersensitivities (also called immediate hypersensitivity), which are characterized as rapidly developing reactions involving IgE antibodies.

A major breakthrough in understanding the mechanisms of allergy was the discovery of the antibody class labeled immunoglobulin E (IgE). IgE was simultaneously discovered in 1966–67 by two independent groups: Ishizaka&#x27;s team at the Children&#x27;s Asthma Research Institute and Hospital in Denver, USA, and by Gunnar Johansson and Hans Bennich in Uppsala, Sweden. Their joint paper was published in April 1969.

===Diagnosis===
Radiometric assays include the radioallergosorbent test (RAST test) method, which uses IgE-binding (anti-IgE) antibodies labeled with radioactive isotopes for quantifying the levels of IgE antibody in the blood.

The RAST methodology was invented and marketed in 1974 by Pharmacia Diagnostics AB, Uppsala, Sweden, and the acronym RAST is actually a brand name. In 1989, Pharmacia Diagnostics AB replaced it with a superior test named the ImmunoCAP Specific IgE blood test, which uses the newer fluorescence-labeled technology.

American College of Allergy Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI) and the American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology (AAAAI) issued the Joint Task Force Report &quot;Pearls and pitfalls of allergy diagnostic testing&quot; in 2008, and is firm in its statement that the term RAST is now obsolete:

The updated version, the ImmunoCAP Specific IgE blood test, is the only specific IgE assay to receive Food and Drug Administration approval to quantitatively report to its detection limit of 0.1kU/L.

==Medical specialty==

The medical speciality that studies, diagnoses and treats diseases caused by allergies is called allergology.
An allergist is a physician specially trained to manage and treat allergies, asthma, and the other allergic diseases. In the United States physicians holding certification by the American Board of Allergy and Immunology (ABAI) have successfully completed an accredited educational program and evaluation process, including a proctored examination to demonstrate knowledge, skills, and experience in patient care in allergy and immunology. Becoming an allergist/immunologist requires completion of at least nine years of training.

After completing medical school and graduating with a medical degree, a physician will undergo three years of training in internal medicine (to become an internist) or pediatrics (to become a pediatrician). Once physicians have finished training in one of these specialties, they must pass the exam of either the American Board of Pediatrics (ABP), the American Osteopathic Board of Pediatrics (AOBP), the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM), or the American Osteopathic Board of Internal Medicine (AOBIM). Internists or pediatricians wishing to focus on the sub-specialty of allergy-immunology then complete at least an additional two years of study, called a fellowship, in an allergy/immunology training program. Allergist/immunologists listed as ABAI-certified have successfully passed the certifying examination of the ABAI following their fellowship.

In the United Kingdom, allergy is a subspecialty of general medicine or pediatrics. After obtaining postgraduate exams (MRCP or MRCPCH), a doctor works for several years as a specialist registrar before qualifying for the General Medical Council specialist register. Allergy services may also be delivered by immunologists. A 2003 Royal College of Physicians report presented a case for improvement of what were felt to be inadequate allergy services in the UK.

In 2006, the House of Lords convened a subcommittee. It concluded likewise in 2007 that allergy services were insufficient to deal with what the Lords referred to as an &quot;allergy epidemic&quot; and its social cost; it made several recommendations.

==Research==
Low-allergen foods are being developed, as are improvements in skin prick test predictions; evaluation of the atopy patch test, wasp sting outcomes predictions, a rapidly disintegrating epinephrine tablet, and anti-IL-5 for eosinophilic diseases.

<text>A deacon is a member of the diaconate, an office in Christian churches that is generally associated with service of some kind, but which varies among theological and denominational traditions.

Major Christian denominations, such as the Catholic Church, the Oriental Orthodox Churches, the Eastern Orthodox Church, Lutheranism, Presbyterianism, Methodism, Anglicanism, and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, view the diaconate as an order of ministry.

Permanent deacons are deacons who are not transitioning into the priesthood, in contrast to those continuing their formation, who were then called transitional deacons.

== Origin and development ==
The word &quot;deacon&quot; is derived from the Greek word (), which is a standard ancient Greek word meaning &quot;servant&quot;, &quot;waiter&quot;, &quot;minister&quot;, or &quot;messenger&quot;. Recent research has highlighted the role of the deacon &quot;as a co-operator&quot; and &quot;go-between,&quot; emphasizing their intermediary position in early Christian communities.

It is generally assumed that the office of deacon originated in the selection of seven men by the apostles, among them Stephen, to assist with the charitable work of the early church as recorded in Acts of the Apostles chapter 6. Newer research emphasizes that while the deacons&#x27; role was indeed to help, their assistance involved more liturgical, teaching and leadership functions than purely charitable work.

The Greek word (), meaning deaconess, is not found in the Bible. However, one woman, Phoebe, is mentioned at Romans 16:1–2 as a deacon or deaconess () of the church in Cenchreae. Nothing more specific is said about her duties or authority, although it is assumed she carried Paul&#x27;s Letter to the Romans.

Female deacons are mentioned by the Roman author Pliny the Younger in a letter to the Roman emperor Trajan dated :

This is the earliest Latin text that appears to refer to female deacons as a distinct category of Christian minister.

A biblical description of the qualities required of a deacon can be found in 1 Timothy 3:1–13.

The Synod of Arles in 314 and the First Council of Nicaea denied deacons the possibility of presiding over the Eucharist even in exceptional cases.

Among the more prominent deacons in history are:

* Stephen, the first Christian martyr (the &quot;protomartyr&quot;)
* Philip, whose baptism of the Ethiopian eunuch is recounted in Acts 8:26–40
* Phoebe, who is mentioned in the Letter to the Romans
* Lawrence, an early Roman martyr
* Vincent of Saragossa, protomartyr of Spain
* Francis of Assisi, founder of the mendicant Franciscans
* Ephrem the Syrian
* Romanos the Melodist, a prominent early hymnographer

Prominent historical figures who played major roles as deacons and went on to higher office include Athanasius of Alexandria, Thomas Becket, and Reginald Pole. On June 8, 536, a serving Roman deacon was raised to Pope, Silverius.

The diaconate has been retained as a separate vocation in Eastern Christianity, while in Western Christianity it was largely used in cathedrals and as a temporary step along the path toward priestly ordination. In the 20th century, the diaconate was restored as a vocational order in many Western churches, most notably in the Catholic Church, the Anglican Communion, and the United Methodist Church.

==By Christian denomination==
In the Catholic, Scandinavian Lutheran, Anglican, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, and Persian churches, the diaconate is one of the major orders—the others being bishop, presbyter (priest), and, historically, subdeacon. Deacons assist priests in their pastoral and administrative duties, but often report directly to the bishops of their diocese. They have a distinctive role in the liturgy of the Eastern and Western Churches.

Deacons are also appointed or elected in other denominations, though this is less commonly seen as a step towards the clerical ministry. The role of deacon in these denominations varies greatly from denomination to denomination; often, there will be more emphasis on administrative duties than on pastoral or liturgical duties. In some denominations, deacons&#x27; duties are only financial management and practical aid and relief. Elders handle pastoral and other administrative duties.

===Latin Catholicism===

Beginning around the fifth century, there was a gradual decline in the diaconate as a permanent state of life in the Latin Church. The development of a (sequence of offices) found men entering the clerical state through tonsure, then ordination to the minor orders of lector, porter, exorcist, acolyte before ordination to the major orders of sub-deacon and deacon, all stages on the path to priesthood. Only men destined for priesthood were permitted to be ordained deacons. As seminaries developed, following the Council of Trent, to contemporary times, the only men ordained as deacons were seminarians who were completing the last year or so of graduate theological training, so-called &quot;transitional deacons&quot;.

Following the recommendations of the Second Vatican Council ( 29) and the instigation of the Josephites (whose work with African Americans necessitated increased vocational opportunity for married men), in 1967 Pope Paul VI issued the motu proprio , reviving the practice of ordaining to the diaconate men who were not candidates for priestly ordination. These men are known as &quot;permanent deacons&quot;, in contrast to those continuing their formation, who were then called &quot;transitional deacons&quot;. There is no sacramental difference between the two, however, as there is only one order of deacons.

The period of formation to the permanent diaconate varies from diocese to diocese as determined by the local ordinary, but it usually entails a period of prayerful preparation and several years of study. Diaconal candidates receive instruction in philosophy, theology, study of the Bible, homiletics, sacramental studies, evangelization, ecclesiology, counseling, and pastoral care and ministry before ordination.

They may be assigned to work in a parish by the diocesan bishop, where they are under the supervision of the parish priests, or in diocesan ministries. Unlike most clerics, permanent deacons who also have a secular profession have no right to receive a salary for their ministry, but many dioceses opt to remunerate them anyway.

During the Mass, the deacon&#x27;s responsibilities include assisting the priest, proclaiming the Gospel, announcing the General Intercessions, and distributing Communion. They may also preach the homily. As clerics, deacons are required to pray the Liturgy of the Hours. Deacons, like priests and bishops, are ordinary ministers of the sacrament of Baptism and may witness at the sacrament of holy matrimony outside of Mass. Deacons may lead funeral rites outside Mass such as the final commendation at the gravesite or the reception of the body at a service in the funeral home, and may assist the priest at the requiem Mass. They can also preside over various services such as Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament, and they may give certain blessings. While in ancient history their tasks and competencies varied, today deacons cannot hear confession and give absolution, anoint the sick, or celebrate Mass.

The vestments most particularly associated with the Latin Catholic deacon are the alb, stole and dalmatic. Deacons, like priests and bishops, must wear their albs and stoles; deacons place the stole over their left shoulder and it hangs across to their right side, while priests and bishops wear it around their necks. The dalmatic, a vestment especially associated with the deacon, is worn during the celebration of the Mass and other liturgical functions; its use is more liberally applied than the corresponding vestment of the priest, the chasuble. At certain major celebrations, such as ordinations, the diocesan bishop wears a dalmatic under his chasuble, now taken to signify that he enjoys the fullness of the three degrees of holy orders—deacon, priest, and bishop, but owing its origin, like the sakkos of Byzantine-rite bishops, to the court dress of the eastern Roman Empire.
The diaconate is conferred on seminarians continuing to the priesthood no sooner than 23 years of age (canon 1031 of the Code of Canon Law). As a permanent state, the diaconate can be conferred on single men 25 or older, and on married men 35 or older, but an older age can be required by the episcopal conference. If a married deacon is widowed, he must maintain the celibate state. Under some very rare circumstances, however, deacons who have been widowed can receive permission to remarry. This is most commonly done when the deacon is left as a single father. In some cases, a widowed deacon will seek priestly ordination, especially if his children are grown.

A deacon is not styled &quot;Father&quot; as a priest would be, but as &quot;Deacon&quot;, abbreviated variously as &quot;Dn.&quot; or &quot;Dcn.&quot; This preferred method of address is stated in the 2005 document of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, &quot;National Directory for the Formation, Ministry and Life of Permanent Deacons in the United States&quot;. 

The proper address in written correspondence for all deacons of the Latin Church in the United States is &quot;Deacon &quot;Name&quot;&quot;, although it is not uncommon to see &quot;Rev. Mr.&quot; sometimes used. &quot;Rev. Mr.&quot;, however, is more often used to indicate a transitional deacon (i.e., preparing for ordination to the priesthood) or one who belongs to a religious institute, while Rev. Deacon is used as the honorific for permanent deacons in many dioceses (e.g., Rev. Deacon John Smith, or Deacon John Smith). The decision as to whether deacons wear the Roman collar as street attire is left to the discretion of each bishop for his own diocese. Where clerical garb is approved by the bishop, the deacon can choose to wear or not wear the &quot;collar&quot;.

Deacons, like seminarians, religious, and the two other orders, bishops and priests, pray the Liturgy of the Hours; however, deacons are usually only required to pray morning and evening prayer.

===Eastern Orthodoxy and Eastern Catholicism===

In addition to proclaiming the Gospel and assisting in the distribution of holy communion, the deacon censes the icons and people, calls the people to prayer, leads the litanies, and has a role in the dialogue of the anaphora. In keeping with Eastern tradition, the deacon is not permitted to perform any sacred mysteries (sacraments) on their own, except for Baptism &quot;in extremis&quot; (in danger of death), conditions under which anyone, including the laity, may baptize. When assisting at a normal baptism, it is often the deacon who goes down into the water with the one being baptized (). In contrast to the Roman Catholic Church, deacons in the Eastern Churches may not preside at the celebration of marriages, as in Eastern theology the sacrament is conferred by the nuptial blessing of a priest.

Diaconal vestments are the sticharion (alb, although it has come to resemble the western dalmatic), the orarion (deacon&#x27;s stole), and the epimanikia (cuffs). The last are worn under the sticharion, not over it as does a priest or bishop. The deacon usually wears a simple orarion which is only draped over the left shoulder but, if elevated to the rank of archdeacon, the deacon wears the &quot;doubled-orarion&quot;, meaning it is passed over the left shoulder, under the right arm, and then crossed over the left shoulder (see photograph, right). In modern Greek practice, a deacon wears this doubled orarion from the time of their ordination. Also, in the Greek practice, a deacon wears the clerical kamilavka (cylindrical head covering) with a rim at the top. In Slavic practice, a hierodeacon (monastic deacon) wears the simple black kamilavka of a monk (without the rim), but removes the monastic veil (see klobuk) when vested; a married deacon would not wear a kamilavka unless it is given to them by the bishop as an ecclesiastical award; the honorary kamilavka is purple in colour, and may be awarded to either married or monastic clergy.

As far as street clothing is concerned, immediately following ordination a deacon receives a blessing to wear the &quot;exorasson&quot; (Arabic: &quot;Jib&#x27;be&quot;, Slavonic: r&quot;iasa&quot;), an outer cassock with wide sleeves, in addition to the &quot;anterion&quot; (Slavonic: podriasnik), the inner cassock worn by all orders of clergy. In the Slavic practice, married clergy may wear any of a number of colours, but most often grey, while monastic clergy always wear black. In certain jurisdictions in North America and Western Europe, a Roman collar is often worn, although this is not a traditional or widespread practice.

A &quot;protodeacon&quot; (Ecclesiastical Greek: , &quot;first deacon&quot;) is a distinction of honor awarded to senior deacons, usually serving on the staff of the diocesan bishop. An &quot;archdeacon&quot; is similar, but is among the monastic clergy. Protodeacons and archdeacons use a double-length orarion even if it is not the local tradition for all deacons to use it. In the Slavic tradition a deacon may be awarded the doubled-orarion even if not a protodeacon or archdeacon.

According to the practice of the Greek Orthodox Church of America, in keeping with the tradition of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, the most common way to address a deacon is &quot;Father&quot;. 

The tradition of kissing the hands of ordained clergy extends to the diaconate as well. This practice is rooted in the holy eucharist and is in acknowledgement and respect of the eucharistic role members of the clergy play in preparing, handling and disbursing the sacrament during the Divine Liturgy, and in building and serving the church as the Body of Christ.

===Lutheranism===
In the Lutheran Churches of the Scandinavian tradition, there is a threefold ministry of &quot;bishops, priests, and deacons&quot;. Until the 1960s, deacons in the Church of Sweden were required to be celibate. For deacons, &quot;vows made at ordination involve seeking and helping anyone in bodily or spiritual need, defending the rights of all, standing beside the oppressed, and exhorting God&#x27;s people to all good works so that the love of God is made visible in the world.&quot; An ordained deacon&#x27;s charism includes &quot;visits, helps, and supports those in bodily or spiritual need; gives Christian nurture and teaching in the faith; is a sign of merciful kindness in the parish and society at large, and in all things serves Christ in the neighbour&quot;.

===Anglicanism===

In Anglican churches, such as the Church of England and the Free Church of England, deacons are permitted to marry freely before or after ordination, as are Anglican priests. Most deacons are &quot;transitional deacons&quot;, that is, preparing for the priesthood and they are usually ordained priests about a year after their diaconal ordination. However, there are some deacons who do not go on to receive priestly ordination, recognising a vocation to remain in the diaconate. A permanent deacon is also known as a &quot;distinctive deacon&quot;, or a &quot;vocational deacon&quot;. 

Many provinces of the Anglican Communion ordain both women and men as deacons. Many of those provinces that ordain women to the priesthood previously allowed them to be ordained only to the diaconate. The effect of this was the creation of a large and overwhelmingly female diaconate for a time, as most men proceeded to be ordained priests after a short time as a deacon.
Anglican deacons may baptize and in some dioceses are granted licences to solemnize matrimony, usually under the instruction of their parish priest and bishop. Deacons are not able to preside at the eucharist (but can lead worship with the distribution of already-consecrated communion elements where this is permitted), nor can they pronounce God&#x27;s absolution of sin or pronounce the Trinitarian blessing. In most cases, deacons minister alongside other clergy.

An Anglican deacon wears an identical choir dress to an Anglican priest: cassock, surplice, tippet and academic hood. However, liturgically, deacons usually wear a stole over their left shoulder and fastened on the right side of their waist. This is worn both over the surplice and the alb. A deacon might also wear a dalmatic. Church of England deacons are supported through the CofE Network of Distinctive Deacons (CENDD). Bishop James Newcome of Carlisle is the Distinctive Deacons’ Champion in the House of Bishops.

===Methodist churches===

In Methodism, deacons began as a transitional order before ordination as elders (presbyters). In 1996, the United Methodist Church ended the transitional deacon and established a new Order of Deacons to be equal in status with the Order of Elders. Both men and women may be ordained as deacons. Deacons serve in a variety of specialized ministries including, but not limited to, Christian education, music, communications and ministries of justice and advocacy. Unlike United Methodist elders, deacons must find their own place of service. Nevertheless, the bishop does officially approve and appoint deacons to their selected ministry. Deacons may assist the elder in the administration of Sacraments, but must receive special approval from a bishop before presiding over Baptism and holy communion. United Methodist deacons are present in North America, Europe and Africa.

The Methodist Church of Great Britain also has a permanent diaconate—based on an understanding of the New Testament that deacons have an equal, but distinct ministry from presbyters. Deacons are called to a ministry of service and witness, and &quot;to hold before them the needs and concerns of the world&quot;. The Methodist Diaconal Order is both an order of ministry and a religious order within the Methodist Church in Britain. It was formed in 1989 as a successor to the Wesley Deaconess Order and is open to both women and men. Diaconal ministry is one of two ordained ministries within the Methodist Church. The original Wesleyan Deaconess Order was founded by Thomas Bowman Stephenson in 1890, following observation of new ministries in urban areas in the previous years. The order continued as the Wesley Deaconess Order following Methodist Union in 1932, but, following the admission of women to &quot;The Ministry&quot; (as presbyteral ministry is commonly termed in the Methodist Church), a number of deaconesses transferred and recruitment for the WDO ceased from 1978. The 1986 Methodist Conference re-opened the order to both men and women and the first ordinations to the renewed order occurred during the 1990 Conference in Cardiff, which coincided with celebrations of 100 years of diaconal service in British Methodism; deaconesses had previously been ordained at their annual convocation.

The Methodist Church of Southern Africa ordains deacons who constitute a diaconal order, similar to that in the British church.

===Reformed churches===

====Church of Scotland (and related Churches)====
There are two distinct offices of deacon in the Church of Scotland. The best-known form of diaconate are trained and paid pastoral workers. The permanent diaconate was formerly exclusively female, and it was in 1988, the centenary year of the diaconate, that men were admitted to the office of deacon. The offices of deacon and minister are now both open to both women and men; deacons are now ordained (they were previously &quot;commissioned&quot;).

The other office of deacon can be found in congregations formerly belonging to the pre-1900 Free Church of Scotland, with a &quot;Deacons&#x27; Court&quot; having responsibility for financial and administrative oversight of congregations. Only a few congregations still retain this constitutional model, with most having since adopted the Church of Scotland&#x27;s &quot;Model Constitution&quot; (with a kirk session and congregational board) or &quot;Unitary Congregation&quot; (with just a kirk session). Most of the Free Church congregations united with the United Presbyterian Church of Scotland in 1900 creating the United Free Church of Scotland, which itself united with the Church of Scotland in 1929.

The 100+ congregations of the remnant post-1900 Free Church of Scotland, alongside those of the Free Presbyterian Church, the Associated Presbyterian Churches and Reformed Presbyterian Church, continue to ordain men as both elders and deacons, with deacons (operating through a Deacons&#x27; Court) caring for the financial and property requirements of the congregation, and attending to the mercy ministry of the local church. Both elders and deacons have to subscribe to the Westminster Confession of Faith before being ordained to the office.

==== Presbyterian churches ====
One of John Calvin&#x27;s legacies was to restore the diaconate as a servant ministry. Individual congregations of the various Presbyterian denominations, such as the Presbyterian Church (USA), Presbyterian Church in America and Orthodox Presbyterian Church, also elect deacons, along with elders. However, in some churches the property-functions of the diaconate and session of elders is commended to an independent board of trustees.

==== Dutch Reformed churches ====
In many Dutch Reformed churches deacons are charged with ministries of mercy. As such, the deacons are also members of the local church council. A special feature of the Dutch Reformed churches is the fact that the diaconate of each local church is its own legal entity with its own financial means, separated from the church itself, and governed by the deacons.

====Uniting Church in Australia====
In the Uniting Church in Australia, the diaconate is one of two offices of ordained ministry. The other is Minister of the Word.

Deacons in the Uniting Church are called to minister to those on the fringes of the church and be involved in ministry in the community. Deacons offer leadership in a ministry of service to the world. The primary focus of the ministry of deacons is on care and compassion for the poor and oppressed and in seeking social justice for all people. They take both an active role in leadership in such actions themselves, but are also play a key role in encouraging other Uniting Church members in similar action.

Some examples of service that deacons may take include: prison chaplaincy, acting as youth or community workers, in community service agencies, in schools and hospitals, or in mission placements in Australia or overseas. Although the primary responsibility for worship in congregations lies with the Ministers of the Word, deacons have a liturgical role appropriate to their distinctive ministry, including ministries where their main leadership is within a congregation.

In the Uniting Church both ministers of the word and deacons are styled &quot;The Reverend&quot;.

The Uniting Church has recognised deacons since union, but it was not until the 6th Assembly in 1991 that the Uniting Church began ordaining deacons. This was partly because the historical, theological and sociological roles of deaconesses and deacons was being widely discussed in Churches throughout the world at the time that the Basis of Union was being drafted 

===Anabaptist Churches===
====Amish====
The Amish have deacons; they are elected by a council and receive no formal training.

====Schwarzenau Brethren====
=====Church of the Brethren=====
The Church of the Brethren also have deacons, as do other Brethren denominations. They are elected by the congregation to serve in ministries of compassion. They are elected for life in some congregations.

===Baptists===
Baptists traditionally recognize two ordained positions in the church: elders (pastors) and deacons, as per 1 Timothy 3. Some Baptist churches in the Reformed tradition recognize elder and pastor as separate offices.

Baptists have traditionally practised congregationalism, giving each church the ability to discern for themselves the interpretation of scripture. Thus, Baptist churches hold a wide variety of views on the qualifications and activities of deacons: some Baptist churches have the deacons decide many of the church affairs, while others have deacons in serving roles only.

The predominant view among Baptist churches (especially theologically conservative ones, including the majority of Southern Baptist and Independent Baptist churches) is that a deacon must be a male, and married (or a widower) and not divorced previously. If a deacon subsequently divorces, he must relinquish his office (but if his wife dies he may continue to serve). However, there are Baptist churches where women are allowed to be deacons or deaconesses (primarily in the United Kingdom and in the United States among African-American and theologically moderate churches). In the General Association of Regular Baptist Churches, deacons can be any adult male member of the congregation who is in good standing.

In some African American Missionary Baptist churches and in churches affiliated with the National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc. male and female deacons serve as one board. Other churches may have two separate boards of deacons and deaconesses. Most often the deacon or deacon candidate is a long-standing member of the church, being middle aged, but younger deacons may be selected from among members of a family that has had several generations in the same church. They are elected by quorum vote annually. Their roles are semi-pastoral in that they fill in for the pastor on occasion, or support the pastor vocally during his sermon. They may also lead a special prayer service, generally known as &quot;The deacon&#x27;s Prayer&quot;. Their other roles are to accompany the pastor during Communion by handing out the remembrances of bread and wine (or grape juice) and to set a good example for others to follow. Their administrative duties sometimes include oversight of the treasury, Sunday school curriculum, transportation, and various outreach ministries.

See Baptist Distinctives for a more detailed treatment of deacons in churches in other associations, particularly the UK.

===Quakers===
Deacons in the structure of most meetings of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) are called overseers. This is not an ordained role but rather a temporary ministry that is discerned every three years. They are responsible for coordinating pastoral care within a community while elders (the equivalent of the Biblical presbyterate) take care of the spiritual concerns of the meeting. Other names include &quot;pastoral care&quot; or &quot;care and counsel&quot;.

===Church of Christ===
In accordance with Church of Christ doctrine and practice, only males may serve as deacons (deaconesses are not recognized), and must meet Biblical qualifications (generally 1 Timothy 3:8–13 is the Biblical text used to determine if a male is qualified to serve as deacon). A deacon may also be qualified to serve as an elder (and, in fact, may move into that role after a period of time if his service as deacon is considered acceptable).

The role of the deacon varies, depending on the local congregation. Generally a deacon will have responsibility for a specific non-spiritual function (e.g. finance, building and grounds, benevolence); however, the deacons (like the rest of the congregation) are under the subjection of the elders, who have spiritual and administrative authority over the deacon&#x27;s function.

In congregations which lack qualified elders (where, in their absence, the men of the congregation handle leadership duties), often there also are no deacons, as they are usually appointed by the elders of the church.

===Irvingian churches===
====New Apostolic Church====
In the New Apostolic Church, the deacon ministry is a local ministry. A deacon mostly works in his home congregation to support the priests. If a priest is unavailable, a deacon will hold a divine service, without the act of communion. (Only priests and up can consecrate holy communion.)

===Restorationist Churches===
====The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints====

The office of deacon is generally open to all 12- and 13-year-old male members of the LDS church; all are encouraged to become deacons. Duties include:

* Gather fast offerings.
* Pass the sacrament.
* Serve as the bishop&#x27;s messenger.
* Care for the grounds and physical facilities of the church.
* Assist in service projects or welfare assignments as assigned by the bishop.
* Watch over the church and act as standing ministers (see D&amp;C 84:111).
* Be involved in missionary and reactivation efforts (see D&amp;C 20:58–59).
* Assist teachers in all their duties as needed (see D&amp;C 20:53, 57).
&#x27;s deacons serve as etiquette checkers and offering collectors for males during worship services, with deaconesses as their female counterparts. In the Iglesia ni Cristo, deacons and deaconesses are usually required to be married. There are also head deacons (an exclusively male role with no head deaconess counterpart) who lead the congregation in the prayer before the sermon and the prayer for offerings. They can also be promoted to Bishops if they are faithful to the rules.
====Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses====
Deacons among Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses are referred to as ministerial servants, claiming it preferable to translate the descriptive Greek term used in the Bible rather than merely transliterate it as though it were a title. Appointed ministerial servants aid elders in congregational duties. Like the elders, they are adult baptized males and serve without a salary.

==Deaconesses==
The title &quot;woman deacon&quot; or &quot;deaconess&quot; appears in many documents from the early church period, particularly in the East. Their duties were often different from that of male deacons; women deacons prepared adult women for baptism and they had a general apostolate to female Christians and catechumens (typically for the sake of modesty). Women appear to have been ordained as deacons to serve the larger community until about the 6th century in the West. Liturgies for the ordination of women deacons had similarities with as well as differences from those for male deacons. Opinions on the sacramental nature of the ordination vary: some scholars argue that the ordination of women deacons would have been equally sacramental to that of male deacons, while others say that women deacons of history were not sacramentally ordained in the full sense, as determined in the Catholic Church by Canons 1008 and 1009 of the Code of Canon Law.

The Catholic Church presently does not recognise the validity of female ordinations, be it to the diaconate or any other clerical order. In August 2016, the Catholic Church established a Study Commission on the Women&#x27;s Diaconate to study the history of female deacons and to study the possibility of ordaining women as deacons. 

The Russian Orthodox Church had a female subdiaconate into the 20th century. 

The Armenian Apostolic Church is still ordaining religious sisters as deaconesses; its last monastic deaconess was Sister Hripsime Sasounian (died in 2007) and on 25 September 2017, Ani-Kristi Manvelian, a twenty-four-year-old lay woman, was ordained in Tehran&#x27;s St. Sarkis Mother Church as the first parish deaconess after many centuries. 

In 2016, the Holy Synod of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria and all Africa voted to reinstate the female diaconate; in the following year, it ordained six sub-deaconesses in the Democratic Republic of Congo. In 2024 the Patriarchate ordained its first female deacon, Angelic Molen, in Zimbabwe, making her the first female deacon in the Eastern Orthodox Church.

== Cognates ==
The Greek word &quot;diakonos&quot; (διάκονος) gave rise to the following terms from the history of Russia, not to be confused with each other: &quot;dyak&quot;, &quot;podyachy&quot;, &quot;dyachok&quot;, in addition to &quot;deacon&quot; and &quot;protodeacon&quot;.

==Scots usage==
In Scots, the title &quot;deacon&quot; is used for a head-workman, a master or chairman of a trade guild, or one who is adept, expert and proficient. The term &quot;deaconry&quot; refers to the office of a &quot;deacon&quot; or the trade guild under a &quot;deacon&quot;.

The most famous holder of this title was Deacon Brodie, who was a cabinet-maker and president of the Incorporation of Wrights and Masons as well as being a Burgh councillor of Edinburgh but at night led a double life as a burglar. He is thought to have inspired the story of &quot;The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde&quot;.

<text>USS &quot;Voyager&quot; (NCC-74656) is the fictional &quot;Intrepid&quot;-class starship which is the primary setting of the science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;. It is commanded by Captain Kathryn Janeway. &quot;Voyager&quot; was designed by &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; production designer Richard D. James and illustrator Rick Sternbach. Most of the ship&#x27;s on-screen appearances are computer-generated imagery (CGI), although models were also sometimes used. The ship&#x27;s motto, as engraved on its dedication plaque, is a quote from the poem &quot;Locksley Hall&quot; by Alfred, Lord Tennyson: &quot;For I dipt in to the future, far as human eye could see; Saw the vision of the world, and all the wonder that would be.&quot;

&quot;Voyager&quot; made its television debut in January 1995 in &quot;Caretaker&quot;, the most expensive pilot in television history up to that point, reportedly costing $23 million. In addition to its namesake television show, the spacecraft appeared in the computer game &quot;Star Trek: Voyager Elite Force&quot; (2000). The spacecraft design was also used for Star Trek: The Experience, a theme park in Las Vegas from 1998 to 2008, and as album art.

==Concept and design==
Rick Sternbach, who designed the Borg cube for &quot;The Next Generation&quot;, and Richard James collaborated over several months to design the USS &quot;Voyager&quot;. Sternbach started work on the new design in the fall of 1993 when the new series was announced. By the spring of 1994, the design had started to mature, and was smaller than &quot;The Next Generation&quot; &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D with features like the ability to land on a planet&#x27;s surface. The interior design focused on the bridge, which set the tone for the rest of ship. Throughout the design process, the main goal was to make it new and appealing while still holding in part to the same familiar design.

&quot;Voyager&quot; special effect shots were done with both miniatures and CGI. The miniature shots of the &quot;Voyager&quot; model were used as a benchmark to improve the CGI shots. Two different computer models were developed from the physical model by two different companies that scanned it, Amblin Imaging and Foundation Imaging. Amblin won an Emmy for &quot;Voyager&quot; opening CGI title visuals featuring USS &quot;Voyager&quot; passing through space, but the weekly episode exteriors were captured with hand-built miniatures of &quot;Voyager&quot;. By late 1996 (midway through season three), certain exterior shots were fully CGI. Another challenge of the design was coordinating the interior set design with exterior shots, in particular the location of key rooms and the design of windows. These were important, for example, in shots that crossed over from outside the spacecraft to inside the spacecraft in one filming shot.

The principal model of &quot;Voyager&quot; used for filming sold at a Christie&#x27;s auction in 2006 for 132,000 USD.

===Mission===
&quot;Voyager&quot; was launched in 2371. The crew&#x27;s first mission was to track down a Maquis ship in the Badlands. An alien force called the Caretaker transported both &quot;Voyager&quot; and the Maquis vessel across 70,000 light-years to the Delta Quadrant, damaging &quot;Voyager&quot; and killing several crewmembers including the medical staff, helm officer, first officer and the chief engineer. &quot;Voyager&quot; and the Maquis ship are ultimately stranded in the Delta Quadrant to prevent a genocide of the Ocampans, a species on a nearby planet under the Caretaker&#x27;s protection from the Kazon, an antagonistic race native to the Delta Quadrant who seek the resources of the Ocampa. Captain Janeway orders the destruction of the device that could transport &quot;Voyager&quot; and the Maquis vessel home, thereby protecting the Ocampa. Stranded, and with the Maquis ship also destroyed, both crews integrate and work together for the anticipated 75-year journey home.

The intended crew complement was 141 Starfleet personnel, though it held 153 for its inaugural mission. This figure fluctuated during its time in the Delta Quadrant, gaining or losing count due to mishaps, adopted crew, births, and voluntary departures; they start the second year of their journey with 152 people on board, at one point during the fifth year of its journey, there were 150 people on board.

Starfleet Command eventually becomes aware of the ship&#x27;s presence in the Delta Quadrant and is later able to establish regular communication. After a seven-year journey, during which the acquisition of new technologies and assistance from various allies had already enabled the ship to travel a distance that otherwise would have taken over thirty years, the ship returned to the Alpha Quadrant via a Borg transwarp conduit.

In the &quot;Star Trek: Lower Decks&quot; season 4 premiere &quot;Twovix,&quot; &quot;Voyager&quot; is being converted into a museum when a dormant marcovirus wreaks havoc on the ship. After the incident is concluded, &quot;Voyager&quot; is retired to a museum with the episode&#x27;s events being added to its exhibits.

In &quot;Star Trek: Prodigy&quot; season 2, &quot;Voyager&quot; is replaced by the USS &quot;Voyager&quot;-A which is described by the Doctor as being a &quot;Lamarr&quot;-class science vessel retrofitted with technologies that &quot;Voyager&quot; brought back from the Delta Quadrant. Commanded by now-Vice Admiral Janeway on its maiden voyage. There are several references made to the original &quot;Voyager&quot; with Janeway having a model of the ship in her ready room. During this time, Janeway also celebrates the 14th anniversary of her command of &quot;Voyager&quot; which was Janeway&#x27;s first command. 

&quot;Voyager&quot; is seen briefly in the &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot; third-season episode &quot;The Bounty&quot;, now decommissioned and part of Starfleet&#x27;s Fleet Museum. 

===Design and capabilities===

The 15-deck (257 rooms), &quot;Voyager&quot; was built at the Utopia Planitia Fleet Yards and launched from Earth Station McKinley.

&quot;Voyager&quot; was equipped with 47 bio-neural gel packs and two holodecks. It was equipped with a class-9 warp drive, allowing for a maximum sustainable speed of Warp 9.975. Variable geometry pylons allowed &quot;Voyager&quot; and other &quot;Intrepid&quot;-class ships to exceed warp 5 without damaging subspace. Like the &quot;Galaxy&quot; class, &quot;Voyager&quot; warp nacelles were below the primary hull. The ship also was capable of planetary landings.

&quot;Voyager&quot; also had an Emergency Medical Hologram (EMH) programmed with a library of more than five million different medical treatments from 2,000 medical references and 47 physicians.

The ship was initially equipped with 40 photon torpedoes with type VI warheads, two of which were equipped with tricobalt devices. Both tricobalt devices were used to destroy the Caretaker&#x27;s array. Quantum torpedoes were also compatible with &quot;Voyager&quot; launchers, with some modifications. &quot;Voyager&quot; housed five standard torpedo launchers (two fore, two aft, one ventral) and was able to fire up to four torpedoes per launcher at once. In the final episode, an alternate future Kathryn Janeway equipped the ship with transphasic torpedoes and ablative hull armor.

During the years in the Delta Quadrant, the ship is augmented with custom, non-spec upgrades and modifications, some of which are modified from technology of other cultures, an example being Seven of Nine&#x27;s alcoves and the Delta Flyer which both utilize modified Borg technology. Several pieces of technology from the future were also installed in the final episode, courtesy of Admiral Janeway who went back in time to bring &quot;Voyager&quot; home. Some of the adaptive solutions are to compensate for the disadvantages of being from port, such as the airponics bay and the transformation of the Captain&#x27;s dining room to a galley, and the acquisition of enhancements from aliens in the Void that massively increases replicator efficiency.

Cargo bay 2 is equipped with several Borg alcoves when Captain Janeway forms an alliance with the Borg and several Borg are forced to work aboard &quot;Voyager&quot; during the alliance. Seven of Nine and Harry Kim construct an astrometrics lab from scratch with Borg-enhanced sensors, knowledge of which Seven of Nine retained from the Borg.

==Shuttlecraft==
An important shuttlecraft in many episodes, and operated from the USS &quot;Voyager&quot;, was a spacecraft called the &quot;Delta Flyer&quot;. The &quot;Delta Flyer&quot; was introduced in the Season 5 episode &quot;Extreme Risk&quot;, and was designed and constructed by the crew in the context of the show. The design of the fictional spacecraft by the production staff and how it was presented in special effects has been written about in books about the franchise. The Delta Flyer was designed by illustrator Rich Sternbach, and exterior views were rendered by computer graphics by Foundation Imaging.

One of &quot;Voyager&quot;″s shuttles, the &quot;Aeroshuttle&quot;, was integrated with the hull in the saucer section and although it was never used in an episode, the production team did develop special effects test footage of it disembarking. &quot;Voyager&quot; &quot;Aeroshuttle&quot; was intended as a warp-capable vessel that could also fly in atmospheres; the footage was made by CGI team leaders Rob Bonchune and Adam Lebowitz, along with the VFX producer Dan Curry. Two other craft, the &quot;Manta&quot; and &quot;Cochrane&quot; were also developed but the Manta was not used. &quot;Cochrane&quot; was used in Threshold for the purpose of reaching warp 10.

==Presentations==
In addition to its namesake television show, the spacecraft appeared in the computer game &quot;Star Trek: Voyager Elite Force&quot; (2000). The spacecraft design was also used for Star Trek: The Experience, a theme park in Las Vegas from 1998 to 2008, and as album art. The designs was shown on cover art for LaserDisc releases also.

===In computer gaming===
The &quot;Voyager&quot; design appeared in &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; which originally aired on UPN network from 1995 to 2001, but was also used in a number of computer and video games in that period in various capacities. One was &quot;Star Trek: Voyager – Elite Force&quot; which came out in 2000. This was a computer game style known as a first-person shooter and received a positive reception by the gaming community at that time. &quot;Voyager Elite Force&quot; was ranked second out of ten of the best &quot;Star Trek&quot; games up to 2015. Its sequel was published in 2003. One game based on the show, &quot;Voyager&quot; (circa 1995), was cancelled but has been an influence on other games since.

===Merchandise===
The model-making company Revell released a plastic model of USS &quot;Voyager&quot;. Another pre-built offering was made of metal, and a reviewer praised the &quot;swooshy&quot; &#x27;arrowhead&#x27; style of the design. The form of the design commonly appears in relation to &quot;Voyager&quot; merchandise, or elsewhere in places that make use of &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise content; for example, a view of USS &quot;Voyager&quot; was shown as album art for a 4-CD music collection from the show released in 2017.

==Production==
In late October 1994, the USS Voyager model was delivered to Image G, who did the motion control photography video work with the model for the special effects shots for the upcoming launch of the &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; television show. Image G also did the motion control photography for the Caretaker Array, as well as for the Maquis and Kazon vessels.

The main sets for the interior of the spacecraft were located at Stage 8 and Stage 9 at Paramount Studios.

One of the more complex sets for the spacecraft was the bridge of &quot;Voyager&quot;. The bridge of &quot;Voyager&quot; had 11 different monitors of three different sizes, that had custom graphics displayed depending on what was being shot for each scene. For a scene with the &quot;red alert&quot; setting, the appropriate video graphics would have to be displayed on cue. These graphics were created a by a team of people, with a need for both static and video graphics. Depending on the episode, custom graphics or video sequences would have to be made by a creative team. The videos were recorded to videocassette to be played at the right time, such as when an actor (e.g. &quot;Voyager&quot; crew) was looking at a monitor.

The ship&#x27;s design and sets were also used in the &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; episode &quot;Inter Arma Enim Silent Leges&quot;, this time as the Intrepid Class USS &quot;Bellerophon&quot;.

<text>A first day of issue cover or first day cover (FDC) is a postage stamp on a cover, postal card or stamped envelope franked on the first day the issue is authorized for use within the country or territory of the stamp-issuing authority. Sometimes the issue is made from a temporary or permanent foreign or overseas office. Covers that are postmarked at sea or their next port of call will carry a Paquebot postmark. There will usually be a first day of issue postmark, frequently a pictorial cancellation, indicating the city and date where the item was first issued, and &quot;first day of issue&quot; is often used to refer to this postmark. Depending on the policy of the nation issuing the stamp, official first day postmarks may sometimes be applied to covers weeks or months after the date indicated.

Postal authorities may hold a first day ceremony to generate publicity for the new issue, with postal officials revealing the stamp, and with connected persons in attendance, such as descendants of the person being honored by the stamp. The ceremony may also be held in a location that has a special connection with the stamp&#x27;s subject, such as the birthplace of a social movement, or at a stamp show.

==History==
Prior to 1840, postage costs were very high and they were usually paid by the person who received the mail. The cost was measured by how many sheets were in the letter and how far the letter had to go. Sometimes this amounted to a very considerable sum. Sir Rowland Hill calculated that the cost to the Post Office was far less than what some people were paying to send/receive their mail; this figure was just a fraction of 1d. Hill believed that sending mail should be affordable to all so proposed that postage should be pre-paid, based on the weight rather than the number of sheets and the cost should be drastically reduced. On 10 January 1840 a Uniform 1d postmark was released which allowed a universal penny postage rate, this was a postmark that was paid and was applied when the letter was sent. It was later decided that an adhesive label should be used to prevent forgeries and mis-use of the postal service and the Penny Black stamp was born. It was officially released for sale on 6 May 1840; however, several post offices that received the stamps prior to that date released the stamps early. The City of Bath is known for releasing the stamps on 2 May 1840. Here began the very first First Day Covers.

==Types==
===Event covers===
Event covers, also known as commemorative covers, instead of marking the issuance of a stamp, commemorate events. A design on the left side of the envelope (a &quot;cachet&quot;) explains the event or anniversary being celebrated. Ideally the stamp or stamps affixed relate to the event. Cancels are obtained either from the location (e.g., Cape Canaveral, Anytown) or, in the case of the United States, from the Postal Service&#x27;s Cancellation Services unit in Kansas City.

===Philatelic covers===

Philatelic covers are envelope prepared with a stamp(s), addressed and sent through the mail delivery system to create a collectible item. Information about philatelic covers is available online in catalogs and collector websites.

===Other types===
Computer vended postage stamps issued by Neopost had first-day-of-issue ceremonies sponsored by the company, not by an official stamp-issuing entity. Personalised postage stamps of different designs are sometimes also given first-day-of-issue ceremonies and cancellations by the private designer. The stamps issued by private local posts can also have first days of issue, as can artistamps.

==Features of a cover==
===Postmark===
The postmark is one of the most important features of a cover. Stamps are cancelled by a postmark, which shows they have been used and can’t be re-used to send a letter. Circular Date Stamps (CDS) are the &#x27;bread-and-butter&#x27; postmarks used on everyday mail by Post Office counters across the UK. A CDS postmark is very straight forward and only features the town’s name and the date. There is no picture. If one wanted to use a CDS postmark from a town relevant to the stamp&#x27;s issue, one would have to go to the town’s local Post Office to get it. On a cover, the postmark should touch each stamp and link them to the envelope.
Postmarks came to the foreground in the early 1960s, when collectors started to demand more interesting cancellations on their first day covers. For the Red Cross issue in 1963, a special Florence Nightingale cover was posted at her birthplace, West Wellow. The Botanical Conference issue of 1964 featured primroses on the stamps, so one clever cover dealer posted his covers at Primrose Valley. This kind of relevant postmark made a cover worth often ten times more than the same cover with a standard postmark issued by the Philatelic Bureau at Edinburgh (a place with no connection to the stamps). In the US, the U.S. Postal Service chooses a city, or several, as &#x27;official&#x27; first day cities. These have a special connection to the stamp issue being released, and these postmarks are the only ones that have the wording: &#x27;First Day of Issue&#x27;

===Special handstamps===
With postmarks becoming more and more important to the covers, pictorial postmarks became very popular. Pictorial postmarks are also known as Special Handstamps/Postmarks. In 1924, the first commemorative set of stamps for the British Empire Exhibition had both special postmarks and a special slogan, but it was not until the late 1960s and early 1970s that dealers and organisations really caught on that you could sponsor/design a connected postmark and it would make an ordinary cover something special. These days anyone can sponsor a postmark. They need to design the postmark, get it approved by Royal Mail and then pay a fee. The postmark then becomes the property of Royal Mail and anyone is allowed to use it on their covers. This means that to a certain extent, most cover producers “borrow” other people’s postmarks. However, to be an “official” cover, a postmark has to be on the cover produced by the organisation that sponsored the postmark in the first place.

===Cachet===
As the collecting of first day covers became more popular they began to appear on prepared envelopes, often with an illustration (commonly referred to by collectors as a cachet) that corresponded with the theme of the stamp. Several printing companies began producing such envelopes and often hired freelance illustrators to design their cachets such as Charles R. Chickering who in his earlier years designed postage stamps for the U.S. Post Office. Cachets, which should not be confused with postmarks, are basically rubber stamps. Postmarks can only be applied by official Post Offices whereas anyone can design a cachet and put it on their cover. A cachet makes a cover unique and helps tell the story of the cover. It can say whether the cover was carried (for example, covers were carried on the very last flight of the Concorde), who the signer was or information about the postmark. Royal Mail no longer counts pre-decimal stamps as valid and won’t postmark them, a cachet can therefore be used to &quot;cancel&quot; a pre-decimal stamp on a cover. It provides a link between that stamp and the envelope. They can also be used to &quot;cancel&quot; Cinderella stamps.

<doc id="55319" wikidata="Q193207" url="?curid=55319" title="Ambient music">
<text>Ambient music is a genre of music that emphasizes tone and atmosphere over traditional musical structure or rhythm. Often &quot;peaceful&quot; sounding and lacking composition, beat, and/or structured melody, ambient music uses textural layers of sound that can reward both passive and active listening, and encourage a sense of calm or contemplation. The genre evokes an &quot;atmospheric&quot;, &quot;visual&quot;, or &quot;unobtrusive&quot; quality. Nature soundscapes may be included, and some works use sustained or repeated notes, as in drone music. Bearing elements with new-age music, instruments such as the piano, strings and flute may be emulated through a synthesizer.

The genre originated in the 1960s and 1970s, when new musical instruments were being introduced to a wider market, such as the synthesizer. It was presaged by Erik Satie&#x27;s furniture music and styles such as musique concrète, minimal music, Jamaican dub reggae and German electronic music, but was prominently named and popularized by British musician Brian Eno in 1978 with his album &quot;Ambient 1: Music for Airports&quot;; Eno opined that ambient music &quot;must be as ignorable as it is interesting&quot;, however, in early years, there were artists that were pioneers in this genre, like Jean-Michel Jarre, Vangelis, Mike Oldfield, Wendy Carlos, Kraftwerk, etc. It saw a revival towards the late 1980s with the prominence of house and techno music, growing a cult following by the 1990s. 

Ambient music did not achieve large commercial success, being criticized as everything from &quot;dolled-up new age, ... to boring and irrelevant technical noodling&quot;. Nevertheless, it has attained a certain degree of acclaim throughout the years, especially in the Internet age. Due to its relatively open style, ambient music often takes influences from many other genres, ranging from classical, avant-garde music, experimental music, folk, jazz, and world music, amongst others.

== History ==
===Etymology===
The word English word &quot;ambient&quot; is derived from Latin &quot;ambientem&quot; (nominative &quot;ambiens&quot;) which means &quot;surrounding, encircling, to go around, go about&quot;, which in turn comes from &quot;amb&quot;- &quot;around&quot; (which ultimately derives from PIE root &quot;*ambhi&quot;- &quot;around&quot;). 
===Origins===

As an early 20th-century French composer, Erik Satie used such Dadaist-inspired explorations to create an early form of ambient/background music that he labeled &quot;furniture music&quot; (&quot;Musique d&#x27;ameublement&quot;). This he described as being the sort of music that could be played during a dinner to create a background atmosphere for that activity, rather than serving as the focus of attention.

In his own words, Satie sought to create &quot;a music...which will be part of the noises of the environment, will take them into consideration. I think of it as melodious, softening the noises of the knives and forks at dinner, not dominating them, not imposing itself. It would fill up those heavy silences that sometime fall between friends dining together. It would spare them the trouble of paying attention to their own banal remarks. And at the same time it would neutralize the street noises which so indiscreetly enter into the play of conversation. To make such music would be to respond to a need.&quot;

In 1948, French composer &amp; engineer, Pierre Schaeffer coined the term musique concrète. This experimental style of music used recordings of natural sounds that were then modified, manipulated or effected to create a composition. Shaeffer&#x27;s techniques of using tape loops and splicing are considered to be the precursor to modern day sampling.

In 1952, John Cage released his famous three-movement composition &quot;4&#x27;33&quot; which is a performance of complete silence for four minutes and thirty-three seconds. The piece is intended to capture the ambient sounds of the venue/location of the performance and have that be the music played. Cage has been cited by seminal artists such as Brian Eno as influence.

===1960s===
In the 1960s, many music groups experimented with unusual methods, with some of them creating what would later be called ambient music.

In the summer of 1962, composers Ramon Sender and Morton Subotnick founded The San Francisco Tape Music Center which functioned both as an electronic music studio and concert venue. Other composers working with tape recorders became members and collaborators including Pauline Oliveros, Terry Riley and Steve Reich. Their compositions, among others, contributed to the development of minimal music (also called minimalism), which shares many similar concepts to ambient music such as repetitive patterns or pulses, steady drones, and consonant harmony.

Many records were released in Europe and the United States of America between the mid-1960s and the mid-1990s that established the conventions of the ambient genre in the anglophone popular music market. Some 1960s records with ambient elements include &quot;Music for Yoga Meditation and Other Joys&quot; and &quot;Music for Zen Meditation&quot; by Tony Scott, &quot;Soothing Sounds for Baby&quot; by Raymond Scott, and the first record of the &quot;Environments&quot; album series by Irv Teibel.

In the late 1960s, French composer Éliane Radigue composed several pieces by processing tape loops from the feedback between two tape recorders and a microphone. In the 1970s, she then went on to compose similar music almost exclusively with an ARP 2500 synthesiser, and her long, slow compositions have often been compared to drone music. In 1969, the group COUM Transmissions were performing sonic experiments in British art schools. Pearls Before Swine&#x27;s 1968 album &quot;Balaklava&quot; features the sounds of birdsong and ocean noise, which were to become tropes of ambient music.&quot;

===1970s===
Developing in the 1970s, ambient music stemmed from the experimental and synthesizer-oriented styles of the period.

Between 1974 and 1976, American composer Laurie Spiegel created her seminal work &quot;The Expanding Universe&quot;, created on a computer-analog hybrid system called GROOVE. In 1977, her composition, &quot;Music of the Spheres&quot; was included on Voyager 1 and 2&#x27;s Golden Record.

In April 1975, Suzanne Ciani gave two performances on her Buchla synthesizer – one at the WBAI Free music store and one at Phil Niblock&#x27;s loft. These performances were released on an archival album in 2016 entitled &quot;Buchla Concerts 1975&quot;. According to the record label, these concerts were part live presentation, part grant application and part educational demonstration.

However, it was not until Brian Eno coined the term in the mid-70s that ambient music was defined as a genre. Eno went on to record 1975&#x27;s &quot;Discreet Music&quot; with this in mind, suggesting that it be listened to at &quot;comparatively low levels, even to the extent that it frequently falls below the threshold of audibility&quot;, referring to Satie&#x27;s quote about his musique d&#x27;ameublement.

Other contemporaneous musicians creating ambient-style music at the time included Jamaican dub musicians such as King Tubby, Japanese electronic music composers such as Isao Tomita and Ryuichi Sakamoto as well as the psychoacoustic soundscapes of Irv Teibel&#x27;s &quot;Environments&quot; series, and German experimental bands such as Popol Vuh, Cluster, Kraftwerk, Harmonia, Ash Ra Tempel and Tangerine Dream. Mike Orme of &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; describes the work of Berlin school musicians as &quot;laying the groundwork&quot; for ambient.

The impact the rise of the synthesizer in modern music had on ambient as a genre cannot be overstated; as Ralf Hutter of early electronic pioneers Kraftwerk said in a 1977 &quot;Billboard&quot; interview: &quot;Electronics is beyond nations and colors...with electronics everything is possible. The only limit is with the composer&quot;. The Yellow Magic Orchestra developed a distinct style of ambient electronic music that would later be developed into ambient house music.

==== Brian Eno ====
The English producer Brian Eno is credited with coining the term &quot;ambient music&quot; in the mid-1970s. He said other artists had been creating similar music, but that &quot;I just gave it a name. Which is exactly what it needed ... By naming something you create a difference. You say that this is now real. Names are very important.&quot; He used the term to describe music that is different from forms of canned music like Muzak.

In the liner notes for his 1978 album &quot;Ambient 1:&quot; &quot;Music for Airports&quot;, Eno wrote:


Eno, who describes himself as a &quot;non-musician&quot;, termed his experiments &quot;treatments&quot; rather than traditional performances.

===1980s===
In the late 70s, new-age musician Laraaji began busking in New York parks and sidewalks, including Washington Square Park. It was there that Brian Eno heard Laraaji playing and asked him if he&#x27;d like to record an album. &quot;Day of Radiance&quot; released in 1980, was the third album in Eno&#x27;s Ambient series. Although Laraaji had already recorded a number of albums, this one gave him international recognition. Unlike other albums in the series, &quot;Day of Radiance&quot; featured mostly acoustic instruments instead of electronics.

In the mid-1980s, the possibilities to create a sonic landscape increased through the use of sampling. By the late 1980s, there was a steep increase in the incorporation of the computer in the writing and recording process of records. The sixteen-bit Macintosh platform with built-in sound and comparable IBM models would find themselves in studios and homes of musicians and record makers. However, many artists were still working with analogue synthesizers and acoustic instruments to produce ambient works.

In 1983, Midori Takada recorded her first solo LP &quot;Through the Looking Glass&quot; in two days. She performed all parts on the album, with diverse instrumentation including percussion, marimba, gong, reed organ, bells, ocarina, vibraphone, piano and glass Coca-Cola bottles. Between 1988 and 1993, Éliane Radigue produced three hour-long works on the ARP 2500 which were subsequently issued together as &quot;La Trilogie De La Mort&quot;.

Also in 1988, founding member and director of the San Francisco Tape Music Centre, Pauline Oliveros coined the term &quot;deep listening&quot; after she recorded an album inside a huge underground cistern in Washington which has a 45-second reverberation time. The concept of Deep Listening then went on to become &quot;an aesthetic based upon principles of improvisation, electronic music, ritual, teaching and meditation&quot;.

===1990s===
By the early 1990s, artists such as the Orb, Aphex Twin, Seefeel, the Irresistible Force, Biosphere, and the Higher Intelligence Agency gained commercial success and were being referred to by the popular music press as ambient house, ambient techno, IDM or simply &quot;ambient&quot;. The term chillout emerged from British ecstasy culture which was originally applied in relaxed downtempo &quot;chillout rooms&quot; outside of the main dance floor where ambient, dub and downtempo beats were played to ease the tripping mind.

British artists such as Aphex Twin (specifically: &quot;Selected Ambient Works Volume II&quot;, 1994), Global Communication (&quot;76:14&quot;, 1994), The Future Sound of London (&quot;Lifeforms&quot;, 1994, &quot;ISDN&quot;, 1994), the Black Dog (&quot;Temple of Transparent Balls&quot;, 1993), Autechre (&quot;Incunabula&quot;, 1993, &quot;Amber&quot;, 1994), Boards of Canada, and The KLF&#x27;s &quot;Chill Out&quot;, (1990), all took a part in popularising and diversifying ambient music where it was used as a calming respite from the intensity of the hardcore and techno popular at that time. Other global ambient artists from the 1990s include American composers Stars of the Lid (who released 5 albums during this decade), and Japanese artist Susumu Yokota whose album &quot;Sakura&quot; (1999) featured what Pitchfork magazine called &quot;dreamy, processed guitar as a distinctive sound tool&quot;. 

===2000s===
In the early 2000s, trance music was an offshoot of some psychedelic ambient productions. Established in France in 2001, Ultimae has become the go-to label for space ambient, and they included artists such as Carbon Based Lifeforms. A number of Stockhausen&#x27;s later compositions (not all of them electronic music) feature ambient space music as their theme: The so-called &quot;Urantia&quot; subcycle of &quot;Klang&quot; (Sound, 2006–2007), extending from its thirteenth &quot;hour&quot;, &quot;Cosmic Pulses&quot; to its twenty-first &quot;hour&quot; &quot;Paradies&quot;. 

In the early 2000s, DJs in Ibiza&#x27;s Café Del Mar began creating ambient house mixes that drew on jazz, classical, Hispanic, and New Age sources. Consequently, the popular understanding of &quot;chill-out music&quot; shifted away from &quot;ambient&quot; and into its own distinct genre. In 2009, a genre called &quot;chillwave&quot; was invented by the satirical blog Hipster Runoff for music that could already be described with existing labels such as dream pop. Producer Wolfgang Voigt co-runs the German label Kompakt, which has released installments of the influential ambient techno compilation series &quot;Pop Ambient&quot; annually since 2001.

In February 2008, Atlas Sound debuted with the album &quot;Let the Blind Lead Those Who Can See but Cannot Feel&quot;, which featured ambient pieces. Animal Collective&#x27;s &quot;Merriweather Post Pavilion&quot; was an album released in January 2009 that was particularly influential for its ambient sounds and repetitive melodies.

===2010s–present===
====YouTube====

From the early 2010s to present, ambient music gained widespread recognition on YouTube, with uploaded pieces, usually ranging from one to eight hours long, getting over millions of hits. Such videos are usually titled, or are generally known as, &quot;relaxing music&quot;, and may be influenced by other music genres. Ambient videos assist online listeners with yoga, study, sleep (see music and sleep), massage, meditation and gaining optimism, inspiration, and creating peaceful atmosphere in their rooms or other environments.

Many uploaded ambient videos tend to be influenced by biomusic where they feature sounds of nature, though the sounds would be modified with reverbs and delay units to make spacey versions of the sounds as part of the ambience. Such natural sounds oftentimes include those of a beach, rainforest, thunderstorm and rainfall, among others, with vocalizations of animals such as bird songs being used as well. Pieces containing binaural beats are common and popular uploads as well, which provide music therapy and stress management for the listener. 

====Digital releases====
iTunes and Spotify have digital radio stations that feature ambient music, which are mostly produced by independent labels.

Acclaimed ambient music of this era (according to &quot;Pitchfork&quot; magazine) include works by Max Richter, Julianna Barwick, Grouper, William Basinski, Oneohtrix Point Never, and the Caretaker. In 2011, American composer Liz Harris recording as Grouper released the album &quot;AIA: Alien Observer&quot;, listed by Pitchfork at number 21 on their &quot;50 Best Ambient Albums of All Time&quot;. In 2011, Julianna Barwick released her first full-length album &quot;The Magic Place&quot;. Heavily influenced by her childhood experiences in a church choir, Barwick loops her wordless vocals into ethereal soundscapes. It was listed at number 30 on Pitchfork&#x27;s 50 Best Ambient Albums of All Time. After several self-released albums, Buchla composer, producer and performer Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith was signed to independent record label Western Vinyl in 2015. 

In 2016, she released her second official album &quot;EARS&quot;. It paired the Buchla synthesizer with traditional instruments and her compositions were compared to Laurie Spiegel and Alice Coltrane. Kaitlyn has also collaborated with other well-known Buchla performer, Suzanne Ciani. &quot;Long Ambients 1: Calm. Sleep.&quot; was released by American electronica musician Moby in 2016, as a free download. In March 2019, Moby released a follow-up ambient album, &quot;Long Ambients 2&quot;. Iggy Pop&#x27;s 2019 album &quot;Free&quot; features ambient soundscapes. Mallsoft, a subgenre of vaporwave, features various ambient influences, with artists such as Cat System Corp. and Groceries exploring ambient sounds typical of malls and grocery stores.

== Related and derivative genres ==

=== Ambient house ===

Ambient house is a musical category founded in the late 1980s that is used to describe acid house featuring ambient music elements and atmospheres. Tracks in the ambient house genre typically feature four-on-the-floor beats, synth pads, and vocal samples integrated in an atmospheric style. 

Ambient house tracks generally lack a diatonic center and feature much atonality along with synthesized chords. The Dutch Brainvoyager is an example of this genre. Illbient is another form of ambient house music.

=== Ambient industrial ===
Ambient industrial is a hybrid genre of industrial and ambient music. A &quot;typical&quot; ambient industrial work (if there is such a thing) might consist of evolving dissonant harmonies of metallic drones and resonances, extreme low frequency rumbles and machine noises, perhaps supplemented by gongs, percussive rhythms, bullroarers, distorted voices or anything else the artist might care to sample (often processed to the point where the original sample is no longer recognizable). 

Entire works may be based on radio telescope recordings, the babbling of newborn babies, or sounds recorded through contact microphones on telegraph wires.

=== Ambient pop ===
Ambient pop is a style that developed in the 1980s and 1990s contemporaneously with post-rock; it has also been regarded as an extension of the dream pop movement and the atmospheric style of shoegaze. It incorporates structures that are common to indie music, but extensively explores &quot;electronic textures and atmospheres that mirror the hypnotic, meditative qualities of ambient music&quot;, which is also central to indie electronic music. Ambient pop utilizes the musical experimentation of psychedelia and the repetitive traits of minimalism, krautrock and techno as prevalent influences. Despite being an extension of dream pop, it is distinguished by its adoption of &quot;contemporary electronic idioms, including sampling, although for the most part live instruments continue to define the sound.&quot;

David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Berlin Trilogy&quot; with ambient music pioneer Brian Eno, both of whom were inspired during the production of the albums in the trilogy by German &quot;kosmische Musik&quot; bands and minimalist composers, was regarded as influential on ambient pop. The track &quot;Red Sails&quot; from the trilogy&#x27;s third album, &quot;Lodger&quot; (1979), was retroactively described as a &quot;piece of ambient-pop&quot; by the music journalist David Buckley in &quot;David Bowie: The Music and The Changes&quot;, as it prominently incorporates a motorik drum rhythm, electronically processed guitars and a simplistic melody.

Dream pop band Slowdive&#x27;s 1995 album &quot;Pygmalion&quot; was a major departure from the band&#x27;s usual sound, heavily incorporating elements of ambient electronica and psychedelia with hypnotic, repetitive rhythms, influencing many ambient pop bands and subsequently being regarded as a landmark album in the genre; Pitchfork critic Nitsuh Abebe described the album&#x27;s songs as &quot;ambient pop dreams that have more in common with post-rock [bands] like Disco Inferno than shoegazers like Ride&quot;. The genre continued to stylistically progress in the 2000s with bands including Sweet Trip, Múm, Broadcast, Dntel and his project the Postal Service.

=== Ambient techno ===

Ambient techno is a music category emerging in the late 1980s that is used to describe ambient music atmospheres with the rhythmic and melodic elements of techno. Notable artists include Aphex Twin, B12, Autechre, and the Black Dog.

=== Dark ambient ===
Brian Eno&#x27;s original vision of ambient music as unobtrusive musical wallpaper, later fused with warm house rhythms and given playful qualities by the Orb in the 1990s, found its opposite in the style known as dark ambient. Populated by a wide assortment of personalities—ranging from older industrial and metal experimentalists (Scorn&#x27;s Mick Harris, Current 93&#x27;s David Tibet, Nurse with Wound&#x27;s Steven Stapleton) to electronic boffins (Kim Cascone/PGR, Psychick Warriors Ov Gaia), Japanese noise artists (K.K. Null, Merzbow), and latter-day indie rockers (Main, Bark Psychosis). 

Dark ambient features toned-down or entirely missing beats with unsettling passages of keyboards, eerie samples, and treated guitar effects. Like most styles related in some way to electronic/dance music of the &#x27;90s, it&#x27;s a very nebulous term; many artists enter or leave the style with each successive release. Related styles include ambient industrial (see below) and isolationist ambient.

===Drone music===

Drone music is a minimalist genre of music that emphasizes the use of sustained sounds, notes, or tone clusters called &quot;drones&quot;. It is typically characterized by lengthy compositions featuring relatively slight harmonic variations. La Monte Young, one of its 1960s originators, defined it in 2000 as &quot;the sustained tone branch of minimalism.&quot; Elements of drone music have been incorporated in diverse genres such as rock, ambient, and electronic music.

===New-age music===

Ambient music fused with new-age music styles has an explicit purpose of aiding meditation and relaxation, or aiding and enabling various alternative spiritual practices, such as alternative healing, yoga practice, guided meditation, or chakra auditing. The proponents of new age-ambient music are almost always musicians who create their music expressly for these purposes. To be useful for meditation, the music must have repetitive dynamic and texture without sudden loud chords or improvisation, which could disturb the meditator. It is minimalist in conception, and musicians in the genre are mostly instrumentalists rather than vocalists. 

Subliminal messages are also used in new-age music, and the use of instruments along with sounds of animals (like whales, wolves and eagles) and nature (waterfalls, ocean waves, rain) is also popular. Flautist Dean Evenson was one of the first musicians to combine peaceful music with the sounds of nature, launching a genre that became popular for massage and yoga.

=== Space music ===
Space music, also spelled &quot;Spacemusic&quot;, includes music from the ambient genre as well as a broad range of other genres with certain characteristics in common to create the experience of contemplative spaciousness.

Space music ranges from simple to complex sonic textures sometimes lacking conventional melodic, rhythmic, or vocal components, generally evoking a sense of &quot;continuum of spatial imagery and emotion&quot;, beneficial introspection, deep listening and sensations of floating, cruising or flying.

Space music is used by individuals for both background enhancement and foreground listening, often with headphones, to stimulate relaxation, contemplation, inspiration and generally peaceful expansive moods and soundscapes. Space music is also a component of many film soundtracks and is commonly used in planetariums, as a relaxation aid and for meditation.

==Sleep==

Ambient has been selected by participants from online sleep surveys to aid sleep. The ambient music genre, among other genres, was used in a study pertaining to insomnia in adults, where it facilitated a large improvement in sleep quality for insomnia patients. Participants, who were between 20 and 45 years old, listened to Max Richter&#x27;s album &quot;Sleep&quot;, which was originally meant to work as a sleep aid. They used headphones and were able to shut their eyes, but they were informed to stay in a sitting position so they do not fall asleep. Though one participant fell asleep whilst listening to the music.

==Film soundtracks==
Examples of films with soundtracks that feature some, or extensive, usage of ambient music include, &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; (1956), &quot;THX 1138&quot; (1971), &quot;Solaris&quot; (1972), &quot;Blade Runner&quot; (1982), &quot;The Thing&quot; (1982), &quot;Dune&quot; (1984), &quot;Heathers&quot; (1988), &quot;Akira&quot; (1988), &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; (1995), &quot;Titanic&quot; (1997), &quot;Traffic&quot; (2000), &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; (2001), &quot;Solaris&quot; (2002), &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; (2004), &quot;Pride &amp; Prejudice&quot; (2005), &quot;Moon&quot; (2009), &quot;The Social Network&quot; (2010), &quot;Cosmopolis&quot; (2012), &quot;Her&quot; (2013), &quot;Enemy&quot; (2013), &quot;Drive&quot; (2011), &quot;Interstellar&quot; (2014), &quot;Gone Girl&quot; (2014), &quot;The Revenant&quot; (2015), &quot;Columbus&quot; (2017), &quot;Mandy&quot; (2018), &quot;Annihilation&quot; (2018), &quot;Ad Astra&quot; (2019), &quot;Chernobyl&quot; (2019) and &quot;Dune&quot; (2021), among many others.

<text>A postcard or post card is a piece of thick paper or thin cardboard, typically rectangular, intended for writing and mailing without an envelope. Non-rectangular shapes may also be used but are rare.

In some places, one can send a postcard for a lower fee than a letter. Stamp collectors distinguish between postcards (which require a postage stamp) and postal cards (which have the postage pre-printed on them). While a postcard is usually printed and sold by a private company, individual or organization, a postal card is issued by the relevant postal authority (often with pre-printed postage).

Production of postcards blossomed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. As an easy and quick way for individuals to communicate, they became extremely popular. The study and collecting of postcards is termed &quot;deltiology&quot; (from Greek , small writing tablet, and the also Greek &quot;-logy&quot;, the study of).

== History ==
=== 1840 to 1864 ===

Cards with messages have been sporadically created and posted by individuals since the beginning of postal services. The earliest known picture postcard was a hand-painted design on card created by the writer Theodore Hook. Hook posted the card, which bears a penny black stamp, to himself in 1840 from Fulham (part of London). He probably did so as a practical joke on the postal service, since the image is a caricature of workers in the post office. In 2002 the postcard sold for a record £31,750.

In the United States, the custom of sending through the mail, at letter rate, a picture or blank card stock that held a message, began with a card postmarked in December 1848 containing printed advertising. The first commercially produced card was created in 1861 by John P. Charlton of Philadelphia, who patented a private postal card, and sold the rights to Hymen Lipman, whose postcards, complete with a decorated border, were marketed as &quot;Lipman&#x27;s Postal Card&quot;. These cards had no images. While the United States government allowed privately printed cards as early as February 1861, they saw little use until 1870, when experiments were done on their commercial viability.

=== First postals and private postcards (c. 1865 to 1880) ===

A Prussian postal official, Heinrich von Stephan, first proposed an &quot;open post-sheet&quot; made of stiff paper in 1865. He proposed that one side would be reserved for a recipient address, and the other for a brief message. His proposal was denied on grounds of being too radical and officials did not believe anyone would willingly give up their privacy. In October 1869, the post office of Austria-Hungary accepted a similar proposal, also without images, and 3 million cards were mailed within the first three months. With the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in July 1870, the government of the North German Confederation decided to take the advice of Austrian Emanuel Herrmann and issued postals for soldiers to inexpensively send home from the field.

The period from 1870 to 1874 saw a great number of countries begin the issuance of postals. In 1870, the North German Confederation was joined by Baden, Bavaria, Great Britain, Luxembourg and Switzerland. The year 1871 saw Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden introduce their own postals. Algeria, Chile, France and Russia did so in 1872, and were followed by France, Japan, Romania, Serbia, Spain and the United States between 1873 and 1874. Many of these postals included small images on the same side as the postage. Postcards began to be sent internationally after the first Congress of the General Postal Union, which met in Bern, Switzerland in October 1874. The Treaty of Bern was ratified in the United States in 1875.The first known printed picture postcard, with an image on one side, was created in France in 1870 at Camp Conlie by Léon Besnardeau (1829–1914). Conlie was a training camp for soldiers in the Franco-Prussian War. The cards had a lithographed design printed on them containing emblematic images of piles of armaments on either side of a scroll topped by the arms of the Duchy of Brittany and the inscription &quot;War of 1870. Camp Conlie. Souvenir of the National Defence. Army of Brittany&quot; (in French). While these are certainly the first known picture postcards, there was no space for stamps and no evidence that they were ever posted without envelopes.

In Germany, the bookdealer August Schwartz from Oldenburg is regarded as the inventor of the illustrated postcard. On July 16, 1870, he mailed a post correspondence card with an image of a man with a cannon, signaling the looming Franco-Prussian war.

In the following year the first known picture postcard in which the image functioned as a souvenir was sent from Vienna. The first advertising card appeared in 1872 in Great Britain and the first German card appeared in 1874. Private advertising cards started appearing in the United States around 1873, and qualified for a special postage rate of one cent. Private cards inspired Lipman&#x27;s card were also produced concurrently with the U.S. government postal in 1873. The backs of these private cards contained the words &quot;Correspondence Card&quot;, &quot;Mail Card&quot; or &quot;Souvenir Card&quot; and required two-cent postage if they were written upon.

=== Golden age of postcards (c. 1890 to 1915) ===
Cards showing images increased in number during the 1880s. Images of the newly built Eiffel Tower in 1889 and 1890 gave impetus to the postcard, leading to the so-called &quot;golden age&quot; of the picture postcard. This golden age began slightly earlier in Europe than the United States, likely due to a depression in the 1890s. Still, the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair in 1893 excited many attendees with its line of &quot;Official Souvenir&quot; postals, which popularized the idea of picture postcards. The stage was now set for private postcard industry to boom, which it did once the United States government changed the postage rate for private cards from two cents to one in May 1898.

Spanning from approximately 1905 to 1915 in the United States, the golden age of postcards stemmed from a combination of social, economic, and governmental factors. Demand for postcards increased, government restrictions on production loosened, and technological advances (in photography, printing, and mass production) made the boom possible. In addition, the expansion of Rural Free Delivery allowed mail to be delivered to more American households than ever before. Billions of postcards were mailed during the golden age, including nearly a billion per year in United States from 1905 to 1915, and 7 billion worldwide in 1905. Many postcards from this era were in fact never posted but directly acquired by collectors themselves.

Despite years of incredible success, economic and government forces would ultimately spell the end of the golden age. The peak came sometime between 1907 and 1910 for the United States. In 1909, American publishers successfully lobbied to place tariffs on high quality German imports with the Payne-Aldrich Tariff Act. The effects of tariffs really started to make a large impact, and escalating hostilities in Europe made it difficult to import cards and ink into the United States. The fad may have also simply run its natural course. The war disrupted production efforts in Europe, although postcard production did not entirely stop. Cards were still useful for propaganda, and for boosting troop morale.

=== Post-World War I (1918 to present) ===

After the war, the production of postcards continued, albeit in different styles than before. Demand for postcards decreased, especially as telephone usage grew. There was still a need for postcards, which would be dubbed the &quot;poor man&#x27;s telephone&quot;. As tastes changed, publishers began focusing on scenic views, humor, and fashion. &quot;White border&quot; cards, which existed prior to the war, were produced in greater numbers from roughly 1915 to 1930 in the United States. They required less ink and had lower production standards than fine German cards. These were later replaced by &quot;linen&quot; postcards in the 1930s and 1940s, which used a printing process popularized by Curt Teich. Finally, the modern era of Photochrom (often shortened simply to &quot;chrome&quot;) postcards began in 1939, and gained momentum around 1950. These glossy, colorful postcards are what we most commonly encounter today. Postcard sales dropped to around 25% of 1990s levels, with the growing popularity of social media around 2007, resulting in closure of long-established printers such as J Salmon Ltd in 2017.

==Country specifics==
=== India ===
In July 1879, the Post Office of India introduced a quarter anna postcard that could be posted from one place to another within British India. This was the cheapest form of post provided to the Indian people to date and proved a huge success. The establishment of a large postal system spanning India resulted in unprecedented postal access: a message on a postcard could be sent from one part of the country to another part (often to a physical address without a nearby post office) without additional postage affixed. This was followed in April 1880 by postcards meant specifically for government use and by reply postcards in 1890. The postcard facility continues to this date in independent India.

===Japan===
Official postcards were introduced in December 1873, shortly after stamps were introduced to Japan. Return postcards were introduced in 1885, sealed postcards in 1900, and private postcards were allowed from 1900.

Official Japanese postcards have one side dedicated exclusively to the address, and the other side for the content, though commemorative picture postcards and private picture postcards also exist. In Japan today, two particular idiosyncratic postcard customs exist: and . New Year&#x27;s Day postcards serve as greeting cards, similar to Western Christmas cards, while return postcards function similarly to a self-addressed stamped envelope, allowing one to receive a reply without burdening the addressee with postage fees. Return postcards consist of a single double-size sheet, and cost double the price of a usual postcard – one addresses and writes one half as a usual postcard, writes one&#x27;s own address on the return card, leaving the other side blank for the reply, then folds and sends. Return postcards are most frequently encountered by non-Japanese in the context of making reservations at certain locations that only accept reservations by return postcard, notably at Saihō-ji (moss temple). For overseas purposes, an international reply coupon is used instead.

===Russia===

In the State Standard of the Russian Federation &quot;GOST 51507-99. Postal cards. Technical requirements. Methods of Control&quot; (2000) gives the following definition:

Post Card is a standard rectangular form of a paper for public postings. According to the same state standards, cards are classified according to the type and kind.

Depending on whether or not the image on the card printing postage stamp cards are divided into two types:
*marked;
*unmarked.

Depending on whether or not the card illustrations, cards are divided into two types:
*illustrated;
*simple, that is non-illustrated.

Cards, depending on the location of illustrations divided into:
*Vector card at the location on the front side;
*on the reverse side.

Depending on the walking area cards subdivided into:
*cards for shipment within the Russian Federation (internal post);
*cards for shipment outside of the Russian Federation (international postage).

=== United Kingdom ===
==== History ====
In Britain, postcards without images were issued by the Post Office in 1870, and were printed with a stamp as part of the design, which was included in the price of purchase. These cards came in two sizes. The larger size was found to be slightly too large for ease of handling, and was soon withdrawn in favour of cards 13mm ( inch) shorter. 75 million of these cards were sent within Britain during 1870.

In 1973 the British Post Office introduced a new type of card, PHQ Cards, popular with collectors, especially when they have the appropriate stamp affixed and a first day of issue postmark obtained.

==== Seaside postcards ====

In 1894, British publishers were given permission by the Royal Mail to manufacture and distribute picture postcards, which could be sent through the post. It was originally thought that the first UK postcards were produced by printing firm Stewarts of Edinburgh but later research, published in Picture Postcard Monthly in 1991, has shown that the first UK picture card was published by ETW Dennis of Scarborough. Two postmarked examples of the September 1894 ETW Dennis card have survived but no cards of Stewarts dated 1894 have been found. Early postcards were pictures of landmarks, scenic views, photographs or drawings of celebrities and so on. With steam locomotives providing fast and affordable travel, the seaside became a popular tourist destination, and generated its own souvenir-industry.
In the early 1930s, cartoon-style saucy postcards became widespread, and at the peak of their popularity the sale of saucy postcards reached 16 million a year. They were often bawdy in nature, making use of innuendo and double entendres, and traditionally featured stereotypical characters such as vicars, large ladies, and put-upon husbands, in the same vein as the &quot;Carry On&quot; films.

A notable artist of seaside postcards, often saucy, was the illustrator Thomas Henry, most known for his portrayal of William Brown in the Just William book series by Richmal Crompton. He started drawing postcards as early as 1913, continuing well into the 1950s.

In the early 1950s, the newly elected Conservative government were concerned at the apparent deterioration of morals in the UK and decided on a crackdown on these postcards. The main target of their campaign was the postcard artist Donald McGill. In the more liberal 1960s, the saucy postcard was revived and later came to be considered, by some, as an art form.

Original postcards are now highly sought after, and rare examples can command high prices at auction. The best-known saucy seaside postcards were produced by the publishing company Bamforths of Holmfirth, West Yorkshire.

Despite the decline in popularity of postcards that are overtly &quot;saucy&quot;, postcards continue to be a significant economic and cultural aspect of British seaside tourism. Sold by newsagents and street vendors, as well as by specialist souvenir shops, modern seaside postcards often feature multiple depictions of the resort in unusually favourable weather conditions. John Hinde used saturated colour and meticulously planned his photographs, which made his postcards of the later twentieth century become collected and admired as kitsch. Such cards are also respected as important documents of social history, and have been influential on the work of Martin Parr.

=== United States ===
The United States Postal Service defines a postcard as: rectangular, at least high × long × thick and no more than high × long × thick. However, some postcards have deviated from this (for example, shaped postcards).

==Controversies ==

=== Legalities and censorship ===
The initial appearance of picture postcards (and the enthusiasm with which the new medium was embraced) raised some legal issues. Picture postcards allowed and encouraged many individuals to send images across national borders, and the legal availability of a postcard image in one country did not guarantee that the card would be considered &quot;proper&quot; in the destination country, or in the intermediate countries that the card would have to pass through. Some countries might refuse to handle postcards containing sexual references (in seaside postcards) or images of full or partial nudity (for instance, in images of classical statuary or paintings). For example, the United States Postal Service would only allow the delivery of postcards showing a back view of naked men from Britain if their posteriors were covered with a black bar. Early postcards often showcased photography of nude women. Illegal to produce in the United States, these were commonly known as French postcards, due to the large number of them produced in France. Other countries objected to the inappropriate use of religious imagery. The Ottoman Empire banned the sale or importation of some materials relating to the Islamic prophet Muhammad in 1900. Affected postcards that were successfully sent through the Ottoman Empire before this date (and are postmarked accordingly) have a high rarity value and are considered valuable by collectors.

==== Lynchings ====
In 1873, the Comstock Act was passed in the United States, which banned the publication of &quot;obscene matter as well as its circulation in the mails&quot;. In 1908, §3893 was added to the Comstock Act, stating that the ban included material &quot;tending to incite arson, murder, or assassination&quot;. Although this act did not explicitly ban lynching photographs or postcards, it banned the explicit racist texts and poems inscribed on certain prints. According to some, these texts were deemed &quot;more incriminating&quot; and caused their removal from the mail instead of the photograph itself because the text made &quot;too explicit what was always implicit in lynchings&quot;. Some towns imposed &quot;self-censorship&quot; on lynching photographs, but section 3893 was the first step towards a national censorship. Despite the amendment, the distribution of lynching photographs and postcards continued. Though they were not sold openly, the censorship was bypassed when people sent the material in envelopes or mail wrappers.

==== World War I ====

Censorship played an important role in the First World War. Each country involved utilized some form of censorship. This was a way to sustain an atmosphere of ignorance and give propaganda a chance to succeed. In response to the war, the United States Congress passed the Espionage Act of 1917 and Sedition Act of 1918. These gave broad powers to the government to censor the press through the use of fines, and later any criticism of the government, army, or sale of war bonds. The Espionage Act laid the groundwork for the establishment of a Central Censorship Board which oversaw censorship of communications including cable and mail.

Postal control was eventually introduced in all of the armies, to find the disclosure of military secrets and test the morale of soldiers. In Allied countries, civilians were also subjected to censorship. French censorship was modest and more targeted compared to the sweeping efforts made by the British and Americans. In Great Britain, all mail was sent to censorship offices in London or Liverpool. The United States sent mail to several centralized post offices as directed by the Central Censorship Board. American censors would only open mail related to Spain, Latin America or Asia—as their British allies were handling other countries. In one week alone, the San Antonio post office processed more than 75,000 letters, of which they controlled 77 percent (and held 20 percent for the following week).

Soldiers on the front developed strategies to circumvent censors. Some would go on &quot;home leave&quot; and take messages with them to post from a remote location. Those writing postcards in the field knew they were being censored, and deliberately held back controversial content and personal matters. Those writing home had a few options including free, government-issued field postcards, cheap, picture postcards, and embroidered cards meant as keepsakes. Unfortunately, censors often disapproved of picture postcards. In one case, French censors reviewed 23,000 letters and destroyed only 156 (although 149 of those were illustrated postcards). Censors in all warring countries also filtered out propaganda that disparaged the enemy or approved of atrocities. For example, German censors prevented postcards with hostile slogans such as &quot;&quot; (&quot;Every hit a Frenchman&quot;) among others.

== Historical value ==
Postcards document the natural landscape as well as the built environment—buildings, gardens, parks, cemeteries, and tourist sites. They provide snapshots of societies at a time when few newspapers carried images. Postcards provided a way for the general public to keep in touch with their friends and family, and required little writing. Anytime there was a major event, a postcard photographer was there to document it (including celebrations, disasters, political movements, and even wars). Commemorating popular humor, entertainment, fashion, and many other aspects of daily life, they also shed light on transportation, sports, work, religion, and advertising. Cards were sent to convey news of death and birth, store purchases, and employment.
As a primary source, postcards are incredibly important to the types of historical research conducted by historians, historic preservationists, and genealogists alike. They give insight into both the physical world, and the social world of the time. During their heyday postcards revolutionized communication, similar to social media of today. For those studying communication, they highlight the adoption of media, its adaptation, and its ultimate discarding. Postcards have been used to study topics as diverse as theatre, racial attitudes, and war.

=== Digital collections ===
Libraries, archives, and museums have extensive collections of picture postcards; many of the postcards in these collections are digitized Efforts are continuously being made by professionals in these fields to digitize these materials to make them more widely accessible to the public. For those interested, there are already several large collections viewable online. Some large digital collections of postcards include:

* &quot;OldNYC&quot; (New York Public Library)
*Digital Collections (New York Public Library)
**These collections include the Detroit Publishing Company, holiday postcards, WWI postcards, and more.

== Collecting ==
It is likely that postcard collecting first began as soon as postcards were mailed. One could argue that actual collecting began with the acquisition of souvenir postcards from the world&#x27;s fairs, which were produced specifically with the collector (souvenir hunter) in mind. Later, during the golden age of postcards, collecting became a mainstream craze. The frenzy of purchasing, mailing, and collecting postcards was often referred to as &quot;postcarditis&quot;, with up to half purchased by collectors. Clubs such as &quot;The Jolly Jokers&quot;, &quot;The Society for the Promulgation of Post Cards&quot;, and the &quot;Post Card Union&quot; sprang up to facilitate postcard exchanges, each having thousands of members. Postcard albums were commonly seen in Victorian parlors, and had a place of prominence in many middle and upper class households.

Today, postcard collecting is still a popular and widespread hobby. The value of a postcard is mainly determined by the image illustrated on it. Other important factors for collectors can be countries, issuers, and authors. Online catalogs can be found on collector websites and clubs. These catalogs provide detailed information about each postcard alongside their picture. In addition, these websites include collection management tools, trading platforms, and forums to assist with discussions between collectors. The oldest continuously run club in the United States is the &quot;Metropolitan Postcard Club of New York City&quot;, founded in 1946.

:Postcards with a plain back where all of this space was used for the address. This is usually in reference to &quot;early&quot; cards, although undivided were still in common use up until 1907. In 1907, the Universal Postal Congress published a series of decrees that permitted postcards to bear messages on the left half of the card&#x27;s back. This allowed printers to eschew the vignette in favor of extending the picture to the edges, ensuing the divided-back &quot;Golden Age of Postcards.&quot;

;Vignette
:Usually found on &quot;undivided back&quot; cards, consisting of a design that does not occupy the whole of the picture side. Vignettes may be anything from a small sketch in one corner of the card, to a design cover three quarters of the card. The purpose is to leave some space for the message to be written, as the entire reverse of the card could only be used for the address.

;Write-Away
:A card with the opening line of a sentence, which the sender would then complete. Often found on early comic cards.

<doc id="55325" wikidata="Q222018" url="?curid=55325" title="Total Recall (1990 film)">
<text>Total Recall is a 1990 American science fiction action film directed by Paul Verhoeven, with a screenplay by Ronald Shusett, Dan O&#x27;Bannon, and Gary Goldman. The film stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Rachel Ticotin, Sharon Stone, Ronny Cox, and Michael Ironside. Based on the 1966 short story &quot;We Can Remember It for You Wholesale&quot; by Philip K. Dick, &quot;Total Recall&quot; tells the story of Douglas Quaid (Schwarzenegger), a construction worker who receives an implanted memory of a fantastical adventure on Mars. He subsequently finds his adventure occurring in reality as agents of a shadow organization try to prevent him from recovering memories of his past as a Martian secret agent aiming to stop the tyrannical regime of Martian dictator Vilos Cohaagen (Cox).

Shusett bought the rights to Dick&#x27;s short story in 1974 and developed a script with O&#x27;Bannon. Although considered promising, the ambitious scope kept the project in development hell at multiple studios over sixteen years, seeing forty script drafts, seven different directors, and multiple actors cast as Quaid. &quot;Total Recall&quot; eventually entered the early stages of filming in 1987 under the De Laurentiis Entertainment Group shortly before its bankruptcy. Schwarzenegger, who had long held an interest in the project but had been dismissed as inappropriate for the lead role, convinced Carolco Pictures to purchase the rights and develop the film with him as the star. On an estimated $48–80million budget (making it one of the most expensive films made in its time), filming took place on expansive sets at Estudios Churubusco in Mexico over six months. Cast and crew experienced numerous injuries and illnesses during filming.

&quot;Total Recall&quot; was anticipated to be one of the year&#x27;s most successful films. On its release, the film earned approximately $261.4million worldwide, making it the fifth-highest-grossing film of the year. Its critical reception was mixed, with reviewers praising its themes of identity and questioning reality, but criticizing content perceived as vulgar and violent. The practical special effects were well received, earning the film an Academy Award, and the score by Jerry Goldsmith has been praised as one of his best works.

Since its release, &quot;Total Recall&quot; has been praised for its ambiguous ending positing whether Quaid&#x27;s adventures are real or a fantasy, and it has also been analyzed for themes of authoritarianism and colonialism. Retrospective reviews have called it one of Schwarzenegger&#x27;s best films and placed it among the best science fiction films ever made. Alongside comic books and video games, &quot;Total Recall&quot; has been adapted into the 1999 television series &quot;Total Recall 2070&quot;. An early attempt at a sequel, based on Dick&#x27;s &quot;The Minority Report&quot;, became the 2002 standalone film &quot;Minority Report&quot;, and a 2012 remake, also titled &quot;Total Recall&quot;, failed to replicate the success of the original.

==Plot==
In 2084, Mars is a colonized world under the tyrannical regime of Vilos Cohaagen, who controls the mining of valuable turbinium ore. On Earth, construction worker Douglas Quaid experiences recurring dreams about Mars and a mysterious woman. Intrigued, he visits Rekall, a company that implants realistic false memories, and chooses one set on Mars (with a blue sky) where he is a Martian secret agent. However, before the implant is completed Quaid lashes out, already thinking he is a secret agent. Believing Cohaagen&#x27;s &quot;Agency&quot; has suppressed Quaid&#x27;s memories, the Rekall employees erase evidence of Quaid&#x27;s visit and send him home.

En route, Quaid is attacked by men led by his colleague Harry because Quaid unknowingly revealed his past; Quaid&#x27;s instincts take over and he kills his assailants. At home, he is assaulted by his wife Lori, who claims she was assigned to monitor Quaid by the Agency and that their marriage is a false memory implant. He flees but is pursued by armed men led by Richter, Cohaagen&#x27;s operative and Lori&#x27;s real husband. A man who claims to be Quaid&#x27;s former acquaintance gives him a suitcase containing supplies and a video recording in which Quaid identifies himself as Hauser, a Cohaagen ally who defected after falling in love. According to the recording, Cohaagen brainwashed Hauser to become Quaid and conceal his secrets before securing him on Earth. Hauser instructs Quaid to return to Mars and stop Cohaagen.

On Mars, Quaid evades Richter and, following a note from Hauser, travels to Venusville, a district populated by humans and those mutated by air pollution and solar radiation within the cheaply built domes protecting the colony. Quaid meets Melina, the woman from his dreams, who knows him as Hauser and believes he is still working for Cohaagen. In his hotel room, Quaid is confronted by Lori and Dr. Edgemar from Rekall, who explains that Quaid is still at Rekall on Earth, trapped in his fantasy memory and on the verge of permanent brain damage. Quaid notices Edgemar is sweating and, believing he is real, kills him. Quaid is captured by Richter&#x27;s men, but Melina rescues him and Quaid kills Lori. The pair escape with taxi driver Benny to Venusville.

The mutants lead them to a hidden rebel base, where Quaid meets their leader Kuato, a mutant growing out of the abdomen of his brother George. Kuato psychically reads Quaid&#x27;s mind, learning that Cohaagen is hiding a 500,000-year-old alien reactor built into a mountain that, once activated, produces breathable air but could also destroy all turbinium, ending Cohaagen&#x27;s monopoly over both resources. Benny shoots George, revealing himself to be in Cohaagen&#x27;s employ, and Cohaagen&#x27;s forces attack the base, killing the rebels. Kuato implores Quaid to start the reactor before Richter executes him. Cohaagen disables Venusville&#x27;s air supply to slowly suffocate the remaining inhabitants.

Quaid and Melina are brought to Cohaagen, who explains that Hauser was his close friend who volunteered to become Quaid as an elaborate ruse to bypass the mutants&#x27; psychic abilities, infiltrate the rebellion, and destroy it. Quaid&#x27;s Rekall visit had activated him earlier than planned and Cohaagen has been helping him to survive the oblivious Richter&#x27;s pursuit. Cohaagen orders Hauser&#x27;s memories to be restored in Quaid and Melina to be reprogrammed as his subservient lover, but they manage to escape to the mines below the reactor. Benny, Richter, and his men attack them, but the pair outwits and kills them all.

Cohaagen awaits them in the reactor control room, claiming that activating it will destroy the planet. He activates an explosive to destroy the controls, but Quaid throws the explosive into a nearby tunnel, where it detonates and creates a breach to the Martian surface. The explosive decompression blows Cohaagen out to the surface where he suffocates and dies. Quaid activates the reactor before he and Melina are also blown out. The reactor melts the planet&#x27;s ice core into gas that bursts to the surface, forming a breathable atmosphere and saving Quaid, Melina, and the rest of Mars&#x27;s population. As everyone beholds the now-blue sky, Quaid momentarily wonders if everything was a dream, before he and Melina kiss.

==Production==
===Early development===
The development of &quot;Total Recall&quot; began in 1974, when producer Ronald Shusett purchased the adaptation rights to science fiction writer Philip K. Dick&#x27;s 1966 short story &quot;We Can Remember It for You Wholesale&quot; for $1,000. Shusett had read the 23-page story by the then-little-known pulp fiction writer in an April 1966 edition of &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot;. Dick&#x27;s story depicts a meek clerk on Earth named Quail who visits Rekal Incorporated to receive a memory implant of being a secret agent on Mars. However, the process uncovers his true identity as a secret agent who previously visited Mars and whose death will bring about an alien invasion.

Renaming it &quot;Total Recall&quot;, Shusett worked with Dan O&#x27;Bannon to write the script. O&#x27;Bannon exhausted the existing material quickly, and the short story&#x27;s abrupt ending meant he could only write thirty pages, effectively only the first act, and an original second and third act were needed; he suggested sending Quaid to Mars. Shusett and O&#x27;Bannon disagreed over the third act, the former wanting something more dramatic. O&#x27;Bannon&#x27;s ending revealed the handprint on the alien machine as Quaid&#x27;s, who is a replica of the original, and placing his hand on it grants him total memory recall. O&#x27;Bannon described the filmed ending as &quot;lame&quot;. Dick read the script prior to his death in 1982 and, according to O&#x27;Bannon, enjoyed it. Although studios deemed Shusett and O&#x27;Bannon&#x27;s script an ambitious and brilliant idea, it was essentially considered unfilmable, in part because of the extensive special effects and high budget that would be required.

The pair moved on to collaborating on the script for the science fiction horror film &quot;Alien&quot; (1979), the success of which earned Shusett a development deal at Walt Disney Studios. He pursued the &quot;Total Recall&quot; project at the studio, initially budgeted at $20million, but the idea did not progress because issues with the third act could not be resolved. The project was sold to Dino De Laurentiis&#x27;s De Laurentiis Entertainment Group (DEG) in 1982.

===Development under De Laurentiis Entertainment Group===

De Laurentiis considered Richard Rush, Lewis Teague, Russell Mulcahy, and Fred Schepisi to direct the film, before choosing David Cronenberg in 1984. Cronenberg was unfamiliar with Dick&#x27;s work but was interested in the script. Even so, problems remained with the third act and Cronenberg spent the next year writing twelve separate drafts. In his finished script, Quaid&#x27;s true identity is Chairman Mandrell, the dictator of Earth who, following a failed assassination attempt on his life, is convinced by Mars Administrator Cohaagen to confront the organization that suppressed his memory. Cohaagen later reveals that Quaid is an inconsequential government worker chosen to play the role of Mandrell to facilitate Cohaagen usurping control of the Earth. Quaid defeats Cohaagen and assumes the identity of Mandrell. Cronenberg was responsible for the mutant characters, including Kuato (originally called Quato), and further developed an idea by Shusett about mutant animals, known as Ganzibulls, in the Martian sewers; Cronenberg made them mutant camels.

Cronenberg found himself at odds with Shusett regarding the tone, as Shusett and De Laurentiis did not want it to be as serious as the science fiction film &quot;Blade Runner&quot; (1982)—an adaptation of Dick&#x27;s novel &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&quot; (1968). Shusett described Cronenberg&#x27;s work as bringing the film back to Dick&#x27;s original short story, whereas they wanted an adventure closer to &quot;&quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; go to Mars&quot;. Cronenberg did not want to make that film and chose to quit. He was also frustrated by his disagreements with Shusett and De Laurentiis, and the casting of Richard Dreyfuss in the lead role. Dreyfuss had requested further rewrites to have Quaid reflect the everyman persona he had established in his previous films, rather than the action-focus of the Shusett/O&#x27;Bannon story. Cronenberg had wanted to cast William Hurt as the lead instead and focus more on the concepts of memory and identity. Christopher Reeve, Jeff Bridges, and Harrison Ford were also considered for Quaid. De Laurentiis threatened to sue Cronenberg for quitting but was placated by Cronenberg agreeing to work with him on a different film. A few years later, De Laurentiis offered Cronenberg the opportunity to make &quot;Total Recall&quot; as he had wanted, but Cronenberg was not interested and did not want to argue with Shusett again.

De Laurentiis sought to keep the budget low following the financial failure of &quot;Dune&quot; (1984), and wanted to reduce costs by eliminating Mars entirely, but Shusett and O&#x27;Bannon dissented. Problems with finalizing the script and the high budget continued to stall &quot;Total Recall&quot; for the next few years. In 1987, De Laurentiis again considered hiring Rush as director, but De Laurentiis disliked the finale featuring a breathable atmosphere on Mars while Rush supported the idea. De Laurentiis accepted he was wrong after hiring director Bruce Beresford, who also supported the ending. Around this time, writer Gary Goldman was offered an opportunity to refine the script, but he turned it down to focus on his own project, called &quot;Warrior&quot;, that he was working on alongside director Paul Verhoeven at Warner Bros. Pictures. Beresford began preparations for a version of &quot;Total Recall&quot; described by Shusett as less gritty and more &quot;Spielbergian&quot; in tone, and Patrick Swayze was cast as Quaid. Set construction was underway in Australia when DEG filed for bankruptcy in 1988. Approximately 80 crew were fired and the sets had to be destroyed. By this point, the project had already accrued $8million in pre-production costs, and $6million in turnaround costs—a process allowing other studios to purchase the idea.
===Development under Carolco Pictures===

Arnold Schwarzenegger became aware of &quot;Total Recall&quot; in the mid-1980s, either during filming of &quot;Commando&quot; (1985) or &quot;Raw Deal&quot; (1986). He liked the script and agreed to pursue it alongside producer Joel Silver while filming &quot;Predator&quot; (1987), but the project remained unrealized due to its prohibitive budget and because De Laurentiis did not think Schwarzenegger was right for the lead role. Following DEG&#x27;s bankruptcy, Schwarzenegger convinced Andrew G. Vajna and Mario Kassar, co-owners of the independent film studio Carolco Pictures, with whom he had made &quot;Red Heat&quot; (1988), to purchase the rights for $3million, including pre-production costs. Schwarzenegger wanted to star in the film, pending rewrites to his satisfaction, and his fame and international appeal justified the studio investing the necessary budget. Carolco completed its acquisition of the majority of DEG&#x27;s business and assets in April 1989. Schwarzenegger was given substantial influence over the project: he retained Shusett as a screenwriter and co-producer alongside producer Buzz Feitshans, and oversaw script revisions, casting decisions, and set construction. He described himself as effectively an executive producer without the responsibility, but he involved himself heavily because he wanted the project to work. He received a $10–$11million salary, plus 15% of the film&#x27;s profits.

Schwarzenegger hired Verhoeven as the director after being impressed by his science fiction film &quot;RoboCop&quot; (1987), for which Schwarzenegger had been considered in the lead role. Verhoeven had previously been courted by Shusett to direct the film based on his work on &quot;Soldier of Orange&quot; (1977), but declined then because he did not like science fiction. Even so, Verhoeven accepted Schwarzenegger&#x27;s offer after reading the Mars hotel scene where Dr. Edgemar attempts to convince Quaid he is still on Earth. Verhoeven had wanted to avoid special effects-heavy films after &quot;RoboCop&quot; and said that he did not realize how much effects work would be involved. He requested Goldman be brought in to help with rewrites, as well as some core personnel from &quot;RoboCop,&quot; including cinematographer Jost Vacano, production designer William Sandell, and special effects artist Rob Bottin. By this point, approximately thirty drafts had been completed, credited to a combination of Shusett and either O&#x27;Bannon, Jon Povill, or Steven Pressfield, among others. Verhoeven read each one and highlighted those he wanted Goldman to reference.

===Writing===
Goldman had little knowledge of Dick&#x27;s work but tried to respect the source material and work of previous screenwriters. He considered the second half of the film a concession to traditional Hollywood narratives and so retained most of the structure from Beresford&#x27;s shooting script. Because the creative team wanted to commence soon, Goldman believed he did not have the freedom to make substantial changes to the script and focused on refining the existing content and making the scientific aspects more realistic. Verhoeven and Schwarzenegger agreed that everything after Dr. Edgemar&#x27;s visit to Quaid on Mars was not working. Verhoeven wanted a significant change, to indicate that Edgemar could be telling the truth and Quaid is actually having a mental breakdown on Earth. Goldman rewrote the script to make it possible for the film to be viewed as both reality and fantasy. He also made Hauser an ally to Cohaagen, clearly defining Quaid and Hauser as separate identities. Goldman believed that making Hauser evil would better justify Quaid not returning to his original personality. It would also explain why Hauser becomes Quaid: to conceal his intentions from the psychic mutants. Goldman made the Benny character a villain, because he believed African Americans were typically typecast as good characters and the reveal would be surprising.

The script also had to be revised to match Schwarzenegger&#x27;s action-hero public image, although Goldman tried to make it less comical than some of the actor&#x27;s previous films. The meek clerk Quail was renamed Quaid, to avoid referencing then-vice president Dan Quayle, and became a muscle-bound construction worker, while fight scenes were rewritten to include more feats of strength and less martial arts or running. Second unit director and stunt coordinator Vic Armstrong, among other stunt people who had worked with Schwarzenegger on &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot; (1982) and &quot;Red Sonja&quot; (1985), said that they knew what he could physically do without looking silly. Schwarzenegger also wanted more creative methods to dispatch Quaid&#x27;s foes because he had been criticized for an over-reliance on guns to kill people in films like &quot;Commando&quot;. After Goldman&#x27;s first rewrite, he discussed it with Verhoeven, Schwarzenegger, Shusett, Vajna, and Kassar. Schwarzenegger and Shusett believed the climax lacked emotion, which was an intentional choice by Verhoeven, who did not take the Martian rebel plot very seriously and prioritized the intellectual aspects of the narrative. To appease Schwarzenegger, Goldman conceived of Cohaagen shutting off the oxygen to the mutants in Venusville. After nearly sixteen years in development, seven directors, four co-writers, and forty script drafts, &quot;Total Recall&quot; went into production.

===Cast and characters===
Verhoeven chose Michael Ironside to portray Cohaagen&#x27;s henchman Richter. Ironside had previously auditioned for the lead in &quot;RoboCop&quot; and Verhoeven had also offered him the role of antagonist Clarence Boddicker, which he turned down because he did not want to portray another &quot;psychopath&quot; character following his role in &quot;Extreme Prejudice&quot; (1987). Ironside said he considered Richter more of a &quot;sociopath&quot;, who had personal ambitions and covets Cohaagen&#x27;s position. Turning down a role on &quot;RoboCop&quot; and a separate film had created the impression that Ironside was difficult to work with, so he had to complete an audition before being offered the role. In it, he portrayed someone having an emotional breakdown leading to him lying on the floor crying as Verhoeven moved in for a closeup shot. Schwarzenegger believed Ironside&#x27;s physical presence made him a credible threat to his portrayal of Quaid.

The female leads, Rachel Ticotin and Sharon Stone, were chosen in part for their athleticism, which was needed for the physically demanding roles. Stone said that her physically formidable character resulted in the cast and crew treating her like she was &quot;one of the guys&quot;, and that Ironside &quot;was the one guy who never forgot I was a woman. When I was thrown down, he would help me up.&quot; Verhoeven&#x27;s daughters were responsible for casting Benny, picking Mel Johnson Jr.&#x27;s screen test for the available options. He recounted having just finished filming a &quot;horrible&quot; black exploitation film when he read the &quot;Total Recall&quot; script and, after seeing Benny described as a &quot;black jivester&quot;, he threw the script across the room. Nonetheless, he eventually read it through and decided to audition because he believed the character was more fully realized, saying &quot;this guy is cold and calculating and the story was intriguing.&quot;

Cox had previously worked with Verhoeven on &quot;RoboCop&quot; and traded on the actor&#x27;s history of playing good-natured characters to make his villainous turn more impactful. Describing his portrayal, Cox said that he did not employ method acting but did try to understand how the character would feel and think and how he would react to situations and that would determine his performance. The character&#x27;s hairstyle came about after Cox&#x27;s hair was slicked-back in order to make a face mold for special effects purposes. Cox knew it was the right look and convinced Verhoeven to reshoot two days of Cox&#x27;s scenes with the new style. When Marshall Bell auditioned for the role, the script did not explain the relationship between George and Kuato, and he was confused as to why George had so few lines. Although voice actors were considered for Kuato, Verhoeven decided to use Bell. Verhoeven based the appearance and physicality of Brocksmith&#x27;s Dr. Edgemar on the central scientist character portrayed by Paul Newman in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s 1966 thriller &quot;Torn Curtain&quot;. He wanted an actor who looked &quot;naive and strange and a bit weird.&quot;
===Filming and post-production===
Principal photography for &quot;Total Recall&quot; began in April–May 1989. Filmed almost entirely in sequence—a rare feat—the production took place over 20 weeks. The initial budget was reported as $30million, but the final budget was reported as being between $48million and $80million. &quot;Total Recall&quot; was filmed almost entirely on sets at Estudios Churubusco in Mexico City, Mexico, where 43 cast and up to 500 crew members worked across forty-five sets on ten soundstages. The Earth train station was filmed in the Mexico City Metro and many exterior Mars scenes took place at the Valley of Fire State Park in Overton, Nevada.

Shusett and Goldman were present on set, providing additional rewrites where necessary; Goldman estimated the script was changed &quot;less than one percent&quot;. Verhoeven sometimes required up to twenty takes of scenes, but remained faithful to the script and discouraged improvisation. Even so, some scenes, such as Benny&#x27;s death, lacked sufficient detail and in these cases dialogue was mostly improvised. Although Verhoeven had been adamant that he did not want a second unit director—having fired three of them on &quot;RoboCop&quot;—Armstrong ended up filming 1,200 different setups and all of the fight scenes; Verhoeven was happy with his work. Armstrong&#x27;s first scene was filming Schwarzenegger drilling cement.

Filming was beset by injuries and illness. Almost everyone involved suffered from dust inhalation on set. Food poisoning and gastroenteritis from the local Mexican cuisine was also a problem, except for Shusett and Schwarzenegger, who had his food brought from the United States after a negative experience while filming &quot;Predator&quot; in Mexico. The illness compounded the difficulties Lycia Naff had filming her scenes as the three-breasted prostitute. She said she felt like crying because even though the breasts were artificial, she felt exposed in front of the cast and crew. Schwarzenegger cut his wrist while smashing a train window when an explosive designed to pre-detonate the glass failed. His injuries were patched up and concealed by his jacket. He also incurred other minor cuts and broken fingers.

Ironside cracked his sternum and separated two ribs after running into Michael Champion, who was holding an Uzi during the pursuit of Quaid and Melina in a Martian hotel. Filming had to be paused while he recovered, as Richter was involved in most of the remaining scenes. After three weeks, a producer asked that he return to filming but they could not obtain insurance unless Ironside performed fifty push-ups. Despite the doctor&#x27;s advice, he attempted the feat and reinjured himself; after thirty push-ups, the doctor said it was sufficient. Ironside&#x27;s first scene upon his return involved him fighting Schwarzenegger on an elevator, but he struggled to lift his arm. The doctor had Oakland Raiders quarterback Jim Plunkett drop off a brace built for his own injury, which held Ironside&#x27;s chest in a stable position, although it made breathing difficult. Ironside filmed his scene over the remainder of the day, only being hit once accidentally by Schwarzenegger, who was cautious due to his condition. A separate fight between Stone and Ticotin was arranged to feature one of the actresses and one stunt person because padding could not be concealed under their outfits. Verhoeven wanted the actresses to perform the fight stunts themselves, but Armstrong insisted on using a stunt person.

Schwarzenegger was known for his pranks on the set, such as arranging styrofoam snowball fights and water pistol battles during dinners as well as booking parties to reward the crew for the six-day working weeks and practical stunts. Even so, Ironside recounted how Schwarzenegger helped him stay in regular contact with his ill sister using the personal phone in his trailer, at a time before widespread use of mobile phones or internet access. Ironside later learned Schwarzenegger was also regularly calling his sister to check on her.

Initially scheduled for release on June 15, &quot;Total Recall&quot;″s post-production schedule was rushed to move the date forward two weeks to avoid competition from other films, particularly &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; with its cast of popular stars. Editor Frank J. Urioste worked overtime to complete &quot;Total Recall&quot;″s 113-minute cut early. This meant there was no time to test screen the film, which Verhoeven and Goldman believed worked against the finished product, including its third act. The film also had to be trimmed to remove violent content and gore, including a longer version of Benny&#x27;s death, to avoid an X rating, which would have restricted attendance to audience members over the age of 17. &quot;Total Recall&quot; ultimately received an R rating, allowing younger people to see it when accompanied by an adult.
===Special effects and design===

The development of the film&#x27;s special effects was led by Dream Quest Images, with Eric Brevig serving as visual effects supervisor, Alex Funke as special effects photographer, Thomas L. Fisher as special effects supervisor, William Sandell as production designer, and Mary Siceloff as effects producer. Rob Bottin, who previously worked with Verhoeven on &quot;RoboCop&quot;, provided the character visual effects. Concept artist Ron Cobb and illustrator Ron Miller contributed to designs for technology, vehicles, and locations. Additional effects were provided by Metrolight Studios, and Industrial Light &amp; Magic.

&quot;Total Recall&quot; features over 100 visual effects, including miniatures and bluescreen effects. The film was made at the onset of computer-generated imagery (CGI), which was not a suitable option for photorealistic or textured imagery, and was used mainly in the X-ray machine sequence. Most other effects were practical, employing sophisticated prosthetics and animatronics to realize automated taxi drivers, &quot;fat lady&quot; disguises, mutants, and scenes of explosive decompression. &quot;Total Recall&quot; features thirty-five sets across eight of Estudios Churubusco&#x27;s soundstages. The sets were expansive and connected by tunnels so long that they continued outside of the stage, making it possible to drive between them on film.

Expansive locations, including Martian exteriors, were created using miniature sets produced by Stetson Visual Services in Los Angeles, and supervised by Mark Stetson and Robert Spurlock. The sets were large, with the alien reactor being among the largest and most complex sets ever constructed in cinema, and the largest set built for the film. It had to be built vertically to fit on Dream Quest&#x27;s stage. Even so, it was limited by the high ceilings. The Martian mountain set was also substantial, measuring tall and in diameter, with only the frontside constructed, allowing special effects to be operated from behind.

===Music===
The score was composed by Jerry Goldsmith. The producers intended to have him record the score in Munich because the pay for musicians there was lower, but the players were unfamiliar with Goldsmith&#x27;s style and the resulting score was disappointing. Instead, Goldsmith was given the funding necessary to record the score in London with the National Philharmonic Orchestra, who were more fitting to Goldsmith&#x27;s musical intentions with brass and string instruments combined with electronic sounds. The recording was put on hiatus for three months so Verhoeven could have time to edit the special effects, during which Goldsmith recorded the score for &quot;Gremlins 2: The New Batch&quot; (1990), before returning to finish his work on &quot;Total Recall&quot;. Goldsmith also performed the commercial jingles and elevator music heard in the film, and composer Bruno Louchouarn provided additional pieces heard on Mars.

==Release==
===Context===

Following the previous year&#x27;s record $5billion box office, more films than ever were expected to surpass $100million at box office as fifty films were scheduled for release during the summer theater season of 1990 (May 18 – September 3). &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; was predicted to dominate the box office, and films such as &quot;Another 48 Hrs.&quot;, &quot;Back to the Future Part III&quot;, &quot;Days of Thunder&quot;, &quot;Die Hard 2&quot;, &quot;RoboCop 2&quot;, and &quot;Total Recall&quot; were expected to perform well based on their brand recognition and star appeal. These films were all scheduled for release by the end of June to ensure a long theatrical run during the peak time of the year, and other releases were scheduled to avoid opening against them. The importance of domestic box office grosses was also decreasing as studios increasingly earned profits from home media releases, television rights, and markets outside of the United States and Canada. These growing markets were, in turn, increasing film production costs as stars commanded higher salaries to compensate for their international appeal, with &quot;Total Recall&quot;, &quot;Die Hard 2&quot;, and &quot;Days of Thunder&quot; among the most expensive films being released. Average salaries for male leads had also increased to between $7–$11million.

===Marketing===

The teaser for &quot;Total Recall&quot;, made by distributor Tri-Star Pictures, disappointed Schwarzenegger and tested poorly with audiences. It lacked the action scenes and special effects, and presented the film in a vague, dramatic way. Schwarzenegger believed it &quot;cheapened&quot; the film, saying &quot;it looks like a $20million movie in this trailer... it&#x27;s like a $50million movie.&quot; He contacted Peter Guber, the head of Tri-Star&#x27;s owner Sony Pictures Studios, who contracted a different company, Cimmaron/Bacon/O&#x27;Brien, to produce a new trailer focusing on the action and special effects; it fared much better with audiences and attracted praise from industry professionals, such as Joel Silver.

===Box office===
In the U.S. and Canada, &quot;Total Recall&quot; was released on June1, 1990, in 2,060 theaters. It grossed $25.5million—an average of $12,395 per theater—and finished as the number one film of the weekend, ahead of &quot;Back to the Future Part III&quot; ($10.3million), which was in its second weekend of release, and &quot;Bird on a Wire&quot; ($6.3million), in its third. This figure gave it the highest opening weekend gross of the year to date, narrowly beating &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; $25.4million. This was also the highest opening for an R-rated film, and one of the ten highest-grossing three-day opening weekends ever. The film fell to number two in its second weekend, with an additional gross of $15million (a decline of forty-one percent), behind the debut of &quot;Another 48 Hrs.&quot; ($19.5million), and to the number three position in its third week with an additional gross of $10.2million, behind &quot;Another 48 Hrs.&quot; ($10.7million) and the debut of &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; ($22.5million).

By mid-July, the film had earned over $100million and was classified as a success. During the remainder of its sixteen-weekend theatrical run, &quot;Total Recall&quot; never regained the number one position, leaving the top-ten highest-grossing films by the end of July. &quot;Total Recall&quot; earned an approximate total box office gross of $119.4million. This figure made it the second-highest-grossing film of the summer, behind the surprise success of &quot;Ghost&quot;, and the seventh-highest-grossing film of the year behind &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; ($120.1million), &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; ($135.3million), &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; ($178.4million), &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot; ($184.2million), &quot;Ghost&quot; ($217.6million), and &quot;Home Alone&quot; ($285.8million).

Figures are unavailable for all theatrical releases outside of the U.S. and Canada, but the film is estimated to have earned a further $142million, giving it a cumulative worldwide gross of $261.4million, making it the fifth-highest-grossing film of the year, behind &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot; ($424.2million), &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; ($432.6million), &quot;Home Alone&quot; ($476.7million), and &quot;Ghost&quot; ($517.6million). Taking into account production fees, interest, residual payments, and other costs, &quot;Total Recall&quot; is estimated to have returned $36million in profit to the studio.

==Reception==
===Critical response===

On its release, &quot;Total Recall&quot; received mixed reviews from critics, who generally praised the production values and Schwarzenegger&#x27;s performance, but criticized the violent content. Audience polls by CinemaScore reported moviegoers gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an scale.

The narrative polarized reviewers; some praised it as an above-average, complex, and visually interesting science fiction film that successfully blends humor with satirization of the genre&#x27;s tropes, while others found it lacked humor, romance, or a strong narrative structure. Gene Siskel and Peter Travers believed the latter half of the film, after Quaid reaches Mars, to be where &quot;Total Recall&quot; became &quot;mechanical&quot;, abandoning logic and artistic ambition for excessive action and violence. Travers described it as a transitory blockbuster in contrast to &quot;The Terminator&quot; (1984) (also starring Schwarzenegger), which he said would &quot;haunt our dreams&quot;. Several reviewers agreed that the hotel confrontation between Quaid and Rekall&#x27;s Dr. Edgemar on Mars, in which the former learns everything he has experienced is potentially a dream, was the best scene, and found the concept of overwriting memories and identity to be a genuinely horrifying concept. Jonathan Rosenbaum called it a &quot;worthy entry in the dystopian&quot; genre initiated by &quot;Blade Runner&quot; that avoided being derivative of its predecessors.

The film was often compared to Verhoeven&#x27;s previous work on &quot;RoboCop&quot;, with some reviews remarking that &quot;Total Recall&quot; lacked the same &quot;impudence and incandescence&quot; or satirization of 1980s action films as the earlier film. Some said the film was only fun when Verhoeven inserted moments of &quot;RoboCop&quot;″s camp style. &quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s review compared it unfavorably with the Sylvester Stallone action film &quot;Cobra&quot; (1986), saying it was disappointing in its overuse of violence and abandonment of cynicism and creativity for machoism and misogyny. Several reviews focused on the excessive violence, with Vincent Canby describing it as part of an influx of action-adventure films featuring numerous deaths, counting seventy-four kills in the film and over two hundred in &quot;Die Hard 2&quot;. Some were concerned by the dismissive and sometimes comical depiction of the deaths, and the general reliance on violence as a solution to all problems posed. Even so, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;″s review said the violence never seemed to be deliberately sadistic or callous. Despite this criticism, Bottin&#x27;s practical effects were roundly praised, particularly the three-breasted prostitute and mutants that provided many of the film&#x27;s standout visuals, despite their sometimes perverse or macabre nature.

Reviews praised Schwarzenegger for playing against his public action hero image by portraying a confused, vulnerable, and sympathetic character, with Roger Ebert considering him vital to the film&#x27;s success. Desson Howe and Travers described it as Schwarzenegger&#x27;s finest and most interesting work since &quot;The Terminator&quot;. Even so, others believed the actor&#x27;s &quot;superman presence&quot; and comic one-liners were out of place and undermined attempts to make the audience emotionally connect with Quaid&#x27;s genuine fears about his identity. Janet Maslin wrote that this was further harmed by the narrative failing to emphasize his dual identities. Some reviews considered the role to be beyond Schwarzenegger&#x27;s acting abilities, describing him as &quot;unusually oafish... a cross between Frankenstein&#x27;s monster, a hockey puck, and Colonel Klink&quot;, incapable of generating a romantic connection with Stone&#x27;s or Ticotin&#x27;s characters. Some female reviewers were critical of the film&#x27;s treatment of women, who they perceived as &quot;hybrid hooker-commandos&quot; and &quot;basically whores&quot;, writing that the three-breasted prostitute is the film&#x27;s idea of a &quot;witty mutation&quot; while Ticotin &quot;registers less strongly than Stone&#x27;s ambiguous, blonde slut-wife&quot;.

===Accolades===
At the 63rd Academy Awards in 1991, &quot;Total Recall&quot; won the award for Best Visual Effects (Eric Brevig, Rob Bottin, Tim McGovern, and Alex Funke). The film received a further two nominations: Best Sound (Nelson Stoll, Michael J. Kohut, Carlos Delarios, and Aaron Rochin) and Best Sound Effects Editing (Stephen Hunter Flick). At the 44th British Academy Film Awards, the film received one nomination, for Best Special Visual Effects (losing to the comedy film &quot;Honey, I Shrunk the Kids&quot; (1989)). At the 17th Saturn Awards, &quot;Total Recall&quot; was named Best Science Fiction Film. It was also nominated for a Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation (losing to fantasy romance film &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot;).

==Post-release==
===Aftermath===
Following &quot;Total Recall&quot;, Schwarzenegger&#x27;s popularity continued to grow as he went on to star in &quot;Kindergarten Cop&quot; (1990), &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot; (1991), and &quot;True Lies&quot; (1994), earning over $1billion combined at the box office and solidifying his status as the most popular international film celebrity, based on surveys of studio executives and talent agents. Verhoeven worked with Stone again when he directed the box office success &quot;Basic Instinct&quot; (1992) for Carolco. Despite their desire to collaborate on another project, Schwarzenegger and Verhoeven did not work together again. Their last attempt to do so, the big-budget historical drama &quot;Crusade&quot;, was abandoned by Carolco in the mid-1990s in favor of &quot;Cutthroat Island&quot; (1995), a box office flop that contributed to Carolco entering bankruptcy the same year.

Shusett and Goldman did not like aspects of &quot;Total Recall&quot;, believing it was overly long and failed to make the audience care about the mutants, as well as disliking the excessive swearing, violence, and deaths. They also thought the special effect of Schwarzenegger&#x27;s and Ticotin&#x27;s swelling heads went on too long and, alongside Verhoeven, they regretted the rushed post-production and lack of test screenings to solicit feedback that could have led to a &quot;tighter&quot; re-edit on the third act. &quot;Total Recall&quot; also failed to impress Cronenberg, who believed Schwarzenegger was not the right actor for the lead role. Two lawsuits followed the film&#x27;s release. John J. Goncz, a prop maker, sued for $3million alleging that his credit was removed from &quot;Total Recall&quot; after he refused permission for Carolco to merchandise a survival knife he made for it. A separate suit, also for $3million, was brought by the Southern California Consortium, who said &quot;Total Recall&quot; used animated sequences they had created for scientific videos about planets orbiting the Sun. The outcomes of these lawsuits are unknown.

===Home media===
&quot;Total Recall&quot; was released on VHS and LaserDisc on November 1, 1990; it was rushed out to take advantage of the Christmas season. It was priced at $24.99, a relatively low figure compared to standard prices closer to $90, because audience research had shown a willingness to purchase the film due to its rewatchability. Although retailers normally avoided selling films with violent or sexual content, they were willing to stock &quot;Total Recall&quot;. It was predicted to perform well as a purchase and rental. It became one of the bestselling home entertainment products of the year, in which purchases outperformed rentals for the first time. It was also one of the top rentals in December, trading the number one position back and forth with &quot;Pretty Woman&quot;.

The film was first released on DVD in 2000, and received criticism from &quot;IGN&quot; for what was perceived as poor image quality. It was followed by a special edition version in 2001 that included a commentary track with Verhoeven and Schwarzenegger and a documentary about the film&#x27;s production, including its release and subsequent reaction. A special &quot;Total Recall: Mind-Bending Edition&quot; Blu-ray was released in 2012, featuring a high-definition restoration from the original negative. This version included a new interview with Verhoeven and a comparison of the restored footage against the original. For its 30th anniversary in 2021, the film was remastered as a 4K resolution Ultra HD Blu-ray (including a digital copy) based on a digital scan from the original 35mm film negatives under Verhoeven&#x27;s supervision. As well as content from the 2012 Blu-ray, this release introduced a 60-minute documentary about the success and failure of Carolco Pictures, and retrospectives on the film score, special effects, and production. A separate 5-disc collectors edition was released with a double-sided poster, art cards, essays about the film and the score on compact disc (CD).

Goldsmith&#x27;s score was first released on CD in 1990 with 10 tracks. A deluxe edition was released in 2000 with 27 tracks. Coinciding with the 30th anniversary, Quartet Records released the remastered soundtrack on a 2-CD and limited edition 3-Vinyl record set. The anniversary edition included the score plus alternates and source music, restored by Goldsmith&#x27;s long-time sound mixer Bruce Botnick.

===Other media===
A novelization of the film, written by Piers Anthony and based on the script and Dick&#x27;s original novel, was released in 1990; it retains the original character name of Douglas Quail. That same year, an action-platformer video game, &quot;Total Recall&quot;, was released for the Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, and Nintendo Entertainment System, and Amiga, and Atari ST computers. A ZX Spectrum version was planned but cancelled because it would not be ready for the Christmas 1990 release date. A comic book adaptation of the film was also released in 1990 by DC Comics. A 2011 four-issue miniseries comic book was released by Dynamite Entertainment. Written by Vince Moore with art by Cezar Rezak, the series&#x27; narrative continues on from the end of the film, depicting Quaid dealing with a Mars still in chaos following Cohaagen&#x27;s death.

==Themes and analysis==
===Themes===
The main theme of &quot;Total Recall&quot; is the question of whether or not Quaid&#x27;s experiences are real or a dream induced by his failed Rekall memory implantation. Despite the film&#x27;s deviations from Dick&#x27;s original story, both focus on this theme. Verhoeven explicitly wanted both possibilities to be viable, although his personal preference is that Quaid&#x27;s experiences are a dream. He explained &quot;it&#x27;s a dream, which is disturbing to the audience because they don&#x27;t want that, of course. They want an adventure story, they don&#x27;t want a fake adventure story. So they are on [Quaid&#x27;s] side trying to believe that it&#x27;s all true, while [Dr. Edgemar] is trying to tell him that it&#x27;s not true.&quot; Quaid chooses to believe in his reality and kills Dr. Edgemar. Lori confirming that the Quaid persona is effectively a dream breaks down the barrier between reality and fantasy, leaving Quaid and the audience unable to definitively determine the reality of what they are experiencing.

It is left up to the audience to determine what is real, and because of Schwarzenegger&#x27;s public image as a superhuman action hero, the possibility remains that Quaid&#x27;s adventures on Mars are real. Verhoeven said that re-watching the film can induce more doubt in the audience, particularly when the Rekall manager, Bob McClane, effectively outlines everything that will happen to Quaid after the memory implantation. During the same scene, Melina is shown on the Rekall screen before Quaid has met her. At the film&#x27;s end, Quaid still questions if everything is a dream, and Melina suggests that he kiss her before he wakes up. English professor Jason P. Vest said that by not including herself in Quaid&#x27;s possible delusion, Melina both suggests and denies she is a creation of Quaid&#x27;s fantasy. Ironside stated that he believed the film is an analog for manipulating reality for the common people through news and the media at the behest of those in power. Writer Bek Aliev believed that this theme remains relevant in the age of social media, where the line between a person&#x27;s average life and more curated online life becomes blurred.

Another theme of &quot;Total Recall&quot; is the meaning of identity in a world where memories are commodities that can be erased or fabricated completely. Vest contrasted this with &quot;Blade Runner,&quot; in which memory is presented as a precious and vital component of the human experience, while in &quot;Total Recall,&quot; memories can be easily removed, replaced, or revised and these changes are generally embraced. When Quaid learns that he is really Hauser, he affirms to himself &quot;I am Quaid&quot; and rejects the Hauser personality.

Author David Hughes wrote that Quaid is not an altered version of Hauser but a completely separate personality with his own memories and morality. He contrasted Quaid with &quot;Blade Runner&quot;″s replicants—artificial humans—except that it is Quaid&#x27;s mind that is artificial. Quaid is forced to choose between returning to his original but antagonistic persona or remaining as the artificial but benevolent construct of Quaid. Hughes considered this an interesting moral choice and true to Dick&#x27;s work. Quaid is offered a chance at a better life by being restored to Hauser&#x27;s higher social status, but will lose himself in the process. Goldman believed Quaid&#x27;s refusal to be the authentic choice because he did not believe someone would willingly and permanently give up their identity. &quot;SyFy&quot; writer Noah Berlatsky said that as an everyday worker who desires grand adventures, Quaid is an audience stand-in, and suggested the hologram projector that creates a duplicate image of Quaid to be akin to the audience viewing themselves through the phantom personality that is Quaid.

The film presents a politically, morally, and visually unattractive future in which the Earth&#x27;s locations are covered in brutalist, concrete architecture. Verhoeven specifically chose to use this style because he believed it suggested a cruel society indifferent to the suffering of the Martian colonists as long as turbinium ore mining continues. Mars is represented ubiquitously with various red hues, invoking associations with blood, danger, and a hellish domain. The in-film Propaganda networks show reality being altered in real-time, as they brand the resistance as terrorists and describe the indiscriminate slaughter of them as restoring order with minimal use of force.

===Analysis===
According to Vest and English professor Frank Grady, most political assessments of the film considered it left-wing for its anti-corporation and revolutionary message but Vest perceived a more conservative subtext in which the &quot;white protagonist saves a society of the less well-off who cannot save themselves&quot;. They identified &quot;Total Recall&quot; as one of many films produced throughout the 1980s—such as &quot;&quot; (1985) and &quot;Predator&quot;—that were &quot;fronted by white male characters who employ violence to preserve American righteousness, liberty, autonomy, and reinforce an idealistic American image of combating unnecessary bureaucracy, fascists, communists, and foreign and domestic threats&quot;. Schwarzenegger identified himself as a conservative and supporter of U.S. president Ronald Reagan, which Vest opined made him &quot;an unusual choice to portray the protagonist who liberates Mars from Cohaagen&#x27;s dictatorship&quot;. Quaid&#x27;s rejection of the Hauser persona can be seen as an example of self-determination and American exceptionalism, but in doing so he also avoids responsibility or punishment for Hauser&#x27;s acts, which Grady considered an act of moral cynicism. Historian Stephen Prince described Quaid&#x27;s choice not as the loss of self, but conscious rejection of it. Remarking on the similarities between &quot;Total Recall&quot; and the science fiction film &quot;The Matrix&quot; (1999), educator Neal King found that both protagonists begin as discontented workers who learn their life is a fabrication, become instrumental to those rebelling against overwhelming authority, and eventually learn they were deliberately created to quash the rebellion. Any good deeds they perform are a result of who they were programmed to be, meaning their free will is an illusion.

Grady and &quot;SyFy&quot; writer Stephanie Williams described the privatization of air in &quot;Total Recall&quot; as the extreme of unchecked corporate power, comparing it to the real world privatization of water sources by companies whose core incentive is to increase profits, such as in the Flint water crisis. The mutants on Mars are the result of early colonists exposed to a toxic atmosphere because of cheap domes, and their offspring still serve Cohaagen, meaning the authorities have escaped any responsibility for their involvement. In the end, Cohaagen suffocates in a toxic atmosphere that he could have changed at any time. The film also contains a number of product placements for brands such as Pepsi, Coca-Cola, and Jack in the Box, promoting corporate interests while portraying an anti-corporate stance.

Linda Mizejewski, a professor of women&#x27;s studies at the Ohio State University, suggests that the name &quot;Cohaagen&quot; is supposed to sound Afrikaans and this, along with the character&#x27;s links to the mining industry, is part of an analogy between Apartheid-era South Africa, in which there was a highly prosperous mining industry, and sharply defined class divisions, akin to those in the film between the mining executives and the ordinary, oppressed Martians. Likewise, Aliev considered the relationship between the lower classes on Mars and the government to be analogous to real-world colonial and post-colonial social structures, such as Apartheid. The technology that undermines the existing power structure is a metaphor for decolonization and championing the voices of the oppressed. Vest believed &quot;Total Recall&quot; did not offer a positive representation of minorities, as Benny, the only important African American character, collaborates with Cohaagen and helps assassinate the Martian freedom fighter Kuato. Vest believed that his repeated references to having multiple children &quot;reinforced stereotypes of African American men as irresponsible and promiscuous&quot;, and that &quot;his alliance with Cohaagen presents the character as untrustworthy, selfish, and corrupt&quot;.

Vest identified certain elements in the film as sexist and misogynistic. Many female characters are presented as prostitutes or mutants, which he believed suggested that &quot;femininity is a source of moral or physical deformity&quot;. Many female characters are violently killed throughout, such as Lori, who is dispatched while Schwarzenegger quips that she should &quot;consider that a divorce&quot;. However, while Melina is sometimes reliant on Quaid to save her, both she and Lori are portrayed as effective fighters and Melina is essential to saving Quaid&#x27;s life at the end. Union College film studies co-director Michelle Chilcoat wrote that &quot;Total Recall&quot; began a decade of cyberpunk films that focused on a separation and transformation of the mind away from a traditional human body, such as &quot;The Lawnmower Man&quot; (1992), &quot;Strange Days&quot; (1995), and &quot;The Matrix&quot;. Even so, Chilcoat argues that given the option to become anything via Rekall, &quot;Total Recall&quot; repeatedly asserts Quaid&#x27;s heterosexuality.

==Legacy==
===Modern reception===

Since its release, several publications have named &quot;Total Recall&quot; as one of the greatest science fiction films ever made. Rotten Tomatoes named it one of the 300 essential films to watch, and it is also listed in the book &quot;1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die&quot;. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a approval rating from the aggregated reviews of critics, with an average score of . The consensus reads, &quot;Under Paul Verhoeven&#x27;s frenetic direction, &quot;Total Recall&quot; is a fast-paced rush of violence, gore, and humor that never slacks.&quot; The film has a score of 57 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 15 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

In a 2012 retrospective, &quot;Vulture&quot; wrote that despite its anachronistic aspects, such as outdated technology, &quot;Total Recall&quot; remained relevant, particularly in its themes of the oppressed fighting back against their oppressors, which was compared to the 2011 Occupy Wall Street movement. Discussing the film in 2016, &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; described it as one of the best 1980s-style action films. Other publications have called it one of Schwarzenegger&#x27;s most entertaining films and one of his best roles. The film&#x27;s score, by Jerry Goldsmith, is considered among his finest work and, in his own words, one of his &quot;greatest scores&quot;.

A 2020 &quot;Inverse&quot; retrospective argued that &quot;Total Recall&quot;, not &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, was the best adaptation of Dick&#x27;s work, despite its deviations from the source material. He argued that &quot;Blade Runner&quot; presented a stylish and cool future, whereas &quot;Total Recall&quot; presents an &quot;ugly, banal, and grimy&quot; future. Similarly, he believed Quaid&#x27;s upbeat, amoral antihero protagonist was closer to Dick&#x27;s traditional protagonists. Even so, &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; wrote that &quot;its weirdness and appreciation of dumb-fun&quot; meant that it would probably never be as highly considered as &quot;Blade Runner&quot; or films such as &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968). To mark Schwarzenegger&#x27;s 75th birthday in 2022, &quot;Variety&quot; listed &quot;Total Recall&quot; as the fourth-best film in his 46-year career.

===Cultural influence===
&quot;Total Recall&quot; became one of the most expensive films ever made in its time, and one of the last big-budget films to use almost entirely practical special effects. It is also seen as among the films responsible for a significant rise in the costs of film production because of the high salaries studios like Carolco paid to stars with international appeal such as Schwarzenegger, Stallone, and Mel Gibson, recouping their investment by selling their films to the rapidly growing film markets outside of the U.S. and Canada. Alongside the boost to Schwarzenegger&#x27;s career, &quot;Total Recall&quot; also redefined Stone from a model to a legitimate film star.

A 2020 &quot;SyFy&quot; article credited &quot;Total Recall&quot; as one of three action films, along with &quot;Terminator 2&quot; and &quot;True Lies&quot; (1994), that revived Schwarzenegger&#x27;s career after a series of less successful action films such as &quot;The Running Man&quot; (1987), and &quot;Red Heat&quot;. Schwarzenegger recounted coming across the film on television that year, and believing it still held up, saying: &quot;that is really great filmmaking... when you can, after 30 years, watch a movie and it still feels the same.&quot; Schwarzenegger also named his 2012 memoir &quot;Total Recall&quot;.

In 2020, &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that, with hindsight, &quot;Total Recall&quot; formed the middle of Verhoeven&#x27;s unofficial science fiction action film trilogy about authoritarian governance, following &quot;RoboCop&quot; and preceding &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; (1997). Quaid&#x27;s line, &quot;consider that a divorce&quot;, after killing Lori, is considered one of Schwarzenegger&#x27;s most iconic one-line quips from his filmography, and the three-breasted prostitute, portrayed by Lycia Naff, is regarded as an iconic character in cinematic history. Although she eventually came to terms with the role, Naff was initially embarrassed by her appearance in &quot;Total Recall&quot; and avoided interviews or fan interactions, saying &quot;I decided not to answer every letter from every prisoner in the world who was writing to me...&quot;

&quot;Total Recall&quot; influenced films such as &quot;The Matrix&quot;, &quot;The 6th Day&quot; (2000), also starring Schwarzenegger, as well as other media such as &quot;Rick and Morty&quot;, &quot;South Park&quot;, and &quot;The Expanse&quot;. It has been referenced in politics when, during his 2020 address to the Austrian World Summit climate conference about the urgency of their 2050 climate neutrality goal, Dutch politician and European Commissioner for Climate Action, Frans Timmermans, said, &quot;it&#x27;s been 30 years since &quot;Total Recall&quot; and &quot;Kindergarten Cop&quot; — I mean these things go so fast... we have to act now and we can.&quot;

==Sequel and adaptations==
&quot;Total Recall&quot;″s success led to development of a sequel. Goldman had optioned another of Dick&#x27;s works, the 1956 novella &quot;The Minority Report&quot;, intending to direct it himself. Unable to make progress on that project, he and Shusett worked together on adapting &quot;The Minority Report&quot; into a &quot;Total Recall&quot; sequel in 1993, depicting Quaid as the head of an organization that uses mutants with precognition abilities to predict and stop crimes before they happen. Carolco struggled to secure either funding or Schwarzenegger&#x27;s interest to progress the project before its bankruptcy. The television rights to &quot;Total Recall&quot; were bought by DFL Entertainment for $1.2million to develop the television series &quot;Total Recall 2070&quot; (1999). The show, set entirely on Earth, was not based on the film and was described by author David Hughes as closer to a &quot;Blade Runner&quot; adaptation. In the interim, Shusett and Goldman had removed the &quot;Total Recall&quot; elements from their script to develop it as a standalone film, &quot;Minority Report&quot; (2002).

The film rights to &quot;Total Recall&quot; were bought by Dimension Films for $3.15million at Carolco&#x27;s bankruptcy auction. The studio began development of a sequel, intending to bring back the principal cast, but not Verhoeven. Matt Cirulnick developed a script, but Shusett&#x27;s original contract guaranteed him first draft rights to a sequel and he, based on an earlier agreement, was obliged to work with Goldman. The pair&#x27;s story continued from the end of &quot;Total Recall&quot; with Mars now an independent planet. The rebels explore Quaid&#x27;s mind for Hauser&#x27;s memories of a mind-control project. It featured several twists, including Quaid waking up at Rekall on Earth, and other hints that he is living within a dream. Schwarzenegger became actively involved by 1998, but believed their idea was overly complicated. Cirulnick wrote another draft, revealing that Hauser and Quaid are both fabricated personalities, and depicting the destruction of Mars to save Earth from a bomb placed in the Sun. This draft was well received by Dimension, but he was asked to rewrite it to lower the budget. Development eventually ceased as a series of failed films had harmed Dimension financially, and the studio was unable to reach an agreement with Schwarzenegger.

The rights to &quot;Total Recall&quot; were eventually purchased by Columbia Pictures and a remake was announced in 2009. Released in 2012, the film, also called &quot;Total Recall&quot;, starred Colin Farrell, Bryan Cranston, Kate Beckinsale, and Jessica Biel. Its plot follows elements of the 1990 film but omits Mars entirely, taking place on a mostly uninhabitable Earth. The film failed to replicate the financial or critical success of the original.

<text>Neturei Karta () is an anti-Zionist and pro-Palestine Haredi Jewish group.

Founded in Jerusalem in 1937 by Amram Blau and Aharon Katzenelbogen, Neturei Karta was formed as an offshoot of the Aguda movement. Aguda, representing the most devout of the Haredi Jewish community in the Old Yishuv, was opposed to the secular orientation and nationalism of political Zionism, which the religiously devout members of Aguda believed represented a threat to their way of life and was a rejection of Torah law. However, Blau and Neturei Karta disagreed with Aguda&#x27;s accommodationist stance to Zionism in the 1930s in response to European antisemitism.

Neturei Karta believes that the Messiah will usher in a Jewish theocracy to rule over the Land of Israel. The messiah will bring about the resurrection of the dead, the ingathering of the exiles, and a complete return to Torah law. The group, numbering in the low thousands, does not recognize the modern State of Israel, and since the 1960s has pursued relationships with entities who seek the destruction of Israel, such as allies in the Arab world and Iran. It does not support the two-state solution. 

The group&#x27;s views are considered fringe, even within Haredi Jewish circles. Particularly, Neturei Karta&#x27;s relationship with Iran and its attendance at the International Conference to Review the Global Vision of the Holocaust drew condemnation from other Orthodox Jewish movements.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Neturei Karta&quot; means &quot;city guards&quot; in Aramaic and is derived from an &quot;aggadta&quot; recorded in several Talmudic texts, including Jerusalem Talmud Hagigah 1:7 (page 6 in the standard Vilna edition). There, it is related that:
Judah the Prince sent rabbis to tour the cities of Israel and establish for them teachers and scribes. They came to one place and did not find a teacher or a scribe. They said, &quot;Bring us the city guards,&quot; and the city watchmen were brought. They said, &quot;These are the city ruiners, but those are the city guards.&quot; And who were the city guards? The scribes and the teachers, who guard the Torah day and night.
The name thus reflects Neturei Karta&#x27;s original mission to oppose efforts in the Old Yishuv to establish an armed force during the 1936–1939 Arab revolt, arguing that such a force would be destructive and that Torah scholars are the true guards. Today, the Neturei Karta understand it to mean that they defend their interpretation of Halakha against that of other rabbis who support the State of Israel.

==History==
===Pre-Modern State of Israel===
In the Old Yishuv under the Ottoman Empire, the religious Jewish communities primarily concentrated in the Jewish holy cities of Jerusalem, Safed, Hebron, and Tiberias largely eschewed the secular orientation of political Zionism, which they saw as a potential threat to their way of life. They resented the new arrivals, who were predominantly non-religious, while they asserted that Jewish redemption could be brought about only by the Jewish messiah.

In 1921, some of the most devout of the Ashkenazi Old Yishuv formed the Haredi Council of Jerusalem as a counterpoint to the Chief Rabbinate, created by the British Mandatory Palestine government. The Haredi saw the rabbinate as a capitulation to the secular Zionists and their nationalist aspirations.

The Aguda movement represented by the Haredi Council opposed the formation of a Jewish political state in the Land of Israel and discouraged its European members from immigrating to Palestine. However, in the 1930s, the movement adopted a more compromising and accommodationist approach to the Zionist movement in response to rising antisemitism in Europe. Aguda&#x27;s leniency was too much for Rabbi Amram Blau, active in Aguda&#x27;s Jerusalem chapter. Along with Rabbi Aharon Katzenelbogen, Blau split with the Aguda in 1937 and co-founded Chevrat HaChayim, quickly renamed Neturei Karta.

===Modern State of Israel===
After the creation of the modern State of Israel in 1948, Neturei Karta refused to recognize the Israeli government or any of its institutions. The group began holding public protests that often turned violent over what they perceived as the secularization of Jerusalem, the violation of Shabbat in ultra-Orthodox neighborhoods, and public gender mixing.

After the Six Day War, Neturei Karta began cultivating friendly relationships in the Arab world. In 1969, the group protested Israel outside the United Nations, then in 1970 held a similar protest with the new Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). Then Neturei Karta leader Moshe Hirsch befriended PLO leader Yasir Arafat, who many Israelis viewed as their public enemy number one. Arafat appointed Hirsch to the symbolic position of Jewish affairs minister, receiving a $30,000 monthly salary. Two Neturei Karta members participated in a 2004 prayer vigil for Arafat outside the Percy Military Hospital in Paris, France, where he lay on his death bed, an act widely condemned by other Orthodox Jewish organizations, including many other anti-Zionist Haredi organizations, both in New York and Jerusalem. Hirsh attended Arafat&#x27;s funeral in Ramallah.

==Members==
Generally, members of Neturei Karta are descendants of Hungarian Jews and Lithuanian Jews who were students of the Gaon of Vilna (known as &quot;Perushim&quot;) who had settled in Jerusalem in the early nineteenth century. In the late nineteenth century, their ancestors participated in the creation of new neighborhoods outside the city walls to alleviate overcrowding in the Old City, and most are now concentrated in the neighborhood of Batei Ungarin and the larger Meah Shearim neighborhood. Members of the Malachim are also prominently represented within Neturei Karta.

Neturei Karta is notoriously vague about its size, and there are no official population statistics available, in 1971, it was reported to consist of several hundred families in Israel and throughout the diaspora. As recently as 2007, the group was reported to have a few thousand members. &quot;Haaretz&quot; estimated in 2024 that the group had a membership in the low thousands, predominantly in Israel, but also in diaspora locations with large populations of ultra-Orthodox Jews.

==Relationship with other Jewish movements==
The group&#x27;s strong anti-Zionist stance and controversial tactics place Neturei Karta on the fringe, even in Haredi, or ultra-Orthodox circles. Other movements, including anti-Zionist sects like the Satmar, have disavowed Neturei Karta and condemned its activities. The Satmar movement criticized Neturei Karta for attending the International Conference to Review the Global Vision of the Holocaust in Tehran in 2006. During the Gaza war, Rabbi Zalman Leib Teitelbaum, one of the two Grand Rebbes of Satmar, condemned Neturei Karta, calling the group&#x27;s support for Hamas &quot;a terrible desecration of God&#x27;s name.&quot; Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak Jacobson, a leading Chabad rabbi, condemned Neturei Karta and described their actions as &quot;like somebody marching with Hitler.&quot;

One of the targets of the 2008 Mumbai attacks was the Nariman House, which was operated by the Jewish Chabad movement. Neturei Karta subsequently issued a leaflet criticising the Chabad movement for its relations with &quot;the filthy, deplorable traitors – the cursed Zionists that are your friends.&quot; It added that the Chabad movement has been imbued with &quot;false national sentiment&quot; and criticised the organisation for allowing all Jews to stay in its centres, without differentiating &quot;between good and evil, right and wrong, pure and impure, a Jew and a person who joins another religion, a believer and a heretic.&quot; The leaflet also criticised the invitation of Israeli state officials to the funerals of the victims, claiming that they &quot;uttered words of heresy and blasphemy.&quot; The leaflet concluded that &quot;the road [Chabad] have taken is the road of death and it leads to doom, assimilation and the uprooting of the Torah.&quot;

Jewish groups often accuse Neturei Karta of selling out their fellow Jews by allying with antisemitic groups and using their appearance at rallies as token Jews. Neturei Karta have compared Zionists to Nazis; they have denied the Judaism of Zionists, with statements like: &quot;Zionists are not Jews, only racists&quot; and &quot;Zionism does not represent the Jewish people.&quot;

==Beliefs==
=== Exile of the Jewish people ===
Neturei Karta stress what is said in the mussaf Shemona Esrei (&quot;The Standing Prayer&quot;) of Yom Tov, that because of their sins, the Jewish people went into exile from the Land of Israel (&quot;&quot;umipnei chatoeinu golinu meiartzeinu&quot;). Additionally, they maintain the view that any form of forceful recapture of the Land of Israel is a violation of divine will. They believe that the restoration of the Land of Israel to the Jews should happen only with the coming of the Messiah, not by self-determination, and some believe that the introduction of less-observant Jews would cause problems in the sacred land as defined by the Torah.

=== Conditions for a Jewish state ===
Neturei Karta believes that the Messiah will usher in a Jewish theocracy to rule over the Land of Israel. The messiah will bring about the resurrection of the dead, the ingathering of the exiles, and a complete return to Torah law.

Neturei Karta believe that the exile of the Jews can end only with the arrival of the Messiah, and that human attempts to establish Jewish sovereignty over the Land of Israel are sinful. In Neturei Karta&#x27;s view, Zionism is a presumptuous affront against God. Chief among their arguments against Zionism is the Talmudic concept of the so-called Three Oaths, extracted from the discussion of certain portions of the Bible. It states that a pact consisting of three oaths was made between God, the Jewish people, and the nations of the world, when the Jews were sent into exile. One provision of the pact was that the Jews would not rebel against the non-Jewish world that gave them sanctuary; a second was that they would not immigrate en masse to the Land of Israel. In return, the gentile nations promised not to persecute the Jews. By rebelling against this pact, they argued, the Jewish people were engaging in rebellion against God.

The Neturei Karta synagogues follow the customs of the Gaon of Vilna, due to Neturei Karta&#x27;s origin within the Lithuanian rather than Hasidic branch of Haredi Judaism. Neturei Karta is not a Hasidic but a Litvish group; they are often mistaken for Hasidim because their style of dress (including a shtreimel on Shabbos) is very similar to that of Hasidim. This style of dress is not unique to Neturei Karta, but is also the style of other Jerusalem Litvaks, such as Rabbi Yosef Sholom Eliashiv and his followers. Furthermore, Shomer Emunim, a Hasidic group with a similar anti-Zionist ideology, is often bundled together with Neturei Karta. Typically, the Jerusalem Neturei Karta will keep the customs of the &quot;Old &quot;Yishuv&quot; of the city of Jerusalem even when living outside of Jerusalem or even when living abroad, as a demonstration of their love for and connection to the Holy Land.

===Relationship with the State of Israel===
In July 2013, the Shin Bet arrested a 46-year-old member of Neturei Karta for allegedly attempting to spy on Israel for Iran. As part of a plea deal, the man was sentenced to 4 years in prison. Neturei Karta has denied that he had ever been a member of their group.

Neturei Karta&#x27;s website states that its members &quot;frequently participate[s] in public burning of the Israeli flag.&quot; On the Jewish holiday of Purim, Neturei Karta members have routinely burned Israeli flags in celebrations in cities such as London, Brooklyn and Jerusalem.

While many in Neturei Karta chose to simply ignore the State of Israel, this has become more difficult. Some took steps to condemn Israel and bring about its eventual dismantling until the coming of the Messiah. Chief among these was Moshe Hirsch, leader of an activist branch of Neturei Karta, who served in Yasser Arafat&#x27;s cabinet as Minister for Jewish Affairs.

==Activities==
===Palestinian advocacy===
Neturei Karta supports a sovereign Palestinian state in the present, however, argues for complete Jewish sovereignty in the Holy Land upon the arrival of the Messiah.

In addition to halakhic opposition to the organization of a Jewish state in the Holy Land, Neturei Karta also criticizes Israeli policies of aggression towards Palestinian people, stating that the &quot;brutal treatment of the Palestinian people [...] is in violation of the Torah.&quot; They have rejected the claim that Israel is democratic, citing what they refer to as racist, genocidal treatment of Palestinians. They call for the return of all Palestinian refugees to &quot;their rightful land&quot; and attribute the degradation of Jewish-Muslim relations, as well as the bloodshed of both Arabs and Israeli Jews, to Zionism, claiming that before the creation of Israel, both peoples lived together in peace.

Almost a year after the Gaza War, a group of Neturei Karta members crossed into Gaza as part of the Gaza Freedom March to celebrate Jewish &quot;Shabbos&quot; and show support for Palestinians.

In January 2023, three members of Neturei Karta met with prominent Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) officials and families of Palestinian militants during a visit to the Jenin refugee camp. The Neturei Karta members also visited the home of Bassam al-Saadi, who was jailed by Israel for PIJ leadership activities. Upon their return to Israel, Israeli authorities arrested two of the Neturei Karta members for unlawful entry to Area A of the West Bank. The Satmar rebbe publicly denounced the group for their conduct, remarking in his speech that &quot;It is a terrible desecration of God&#x27;s name to support murderers in the name of the holy Torah and God&#x27;s name.&quot;

Neturei Karta asserts that the mass media deliberately downplays their viewpoint and makes them out to be few in number. Their protests in America are usually attended by, at most, a few dozen people. In Israel, the group&#x27;s protests typically attract several hundred participants, depending on the nature of the protest and its location.

Neturei Karta regularly participates in pro-Palestine protests, including protests organized by Palestinian-led groups like Within Our Lifetime. Their signs at Gaza war protests criticize Israel with harsh language like: &quot;Torah true Jews oppose the aggression in al-Aqsa and the occupation of all Palestine&quot; and “State of ‘Israel’ does not represent world Jewry!&quot; According to &quot;The Forward&quot;, the bulk of their statements at protests do not reference their halakhic opposition to Israel but publicly appear close to the views of left-wing American Jewish groups such as IfNotNow and Jewish Voice for Peace.

===Relations with Iran===
In October 2005, Neturei Karta leader Rabbi Yisroel Dovid Weiss issued a statement criticising Jewish attacks on Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Weiss wrote that Ahmadinejad&#x27;s statements were not &quot;indicative of anti-Jewish sentiments&quot;, but rather, &quot;a yearning for a better, more peaceful world&quot;, and &quot;re-stating the beliefs and statements of Ayatollah Khomeini, who always emphasized and practiced the respect and protection of Jews and Judaism.&quot;

In March 2006, several members of a Neturei Karta&#x27;s faction visited Iran, where they met with Iranian leaders, including the vice-president, and praised Ahmadinejad for calling for the &quot;Zionist regime&quot; occupying Jerusalem to vanish from the pages of time. The spokesmen commented that they shared Ahmadinejad&#x27;s aspiration for &quot;a disintegration of the Israeli government&quot;. In an interview with Iranian television reporters, Rabbi Weiss remarked: &quot;The Zionists use the Holocaust issue to their benefit. We, Jews who perished in the Holocaust, do not use it to advance our interests. We stress that there are hundreds of thousands Jews around the world who identify with our opposition to the Zionist ideology and who feel that Zionism is not Jewish, but a political agenda. ... What we want is not a withdrawal to the &#x27;67 borders, but to everything included in it, so the country can go back to the Palestinians and we could live with them ...&quot;.

==== Iranian conference on Holocaust denial in Tehran ====
In December 2006, members of Neturei Karta, including Yisroel Dovid Weiss, attended the International Conference to Review the Global Vision of the Holocaust, a controversial conference held in Tehran, Iran that attracted a number of high-profile Holocaust deniers.

In his speech, Weiss explained that the occurrence of the Nazi Holocaust was irrefutable and spoke about the murder of his own grandparents at Auschwitz, but claimed that Zionists had &quot;collaborated with the Nazis&quot; and &quot;thwarted...efforts to save...Jews&quot; and expressed solidarity with the Iranian position of anti-Zionism. Yonah Metzger, the Chief Ashkenazi Rabbi of Israel, immediately called for those who went to Tehran to be put into &#x27;cherem&#x27;, a form of ex-communication. Subsequently, the Satmar Hassidism court called on Jews &quot;to keep away from them and condemn their actions&quot;.

On 21 December, the Edah HaChareidis rabbinical council of Jerusalem also released a statement calling on the public to distance itself from those who went to Iran. The Edah&#x27;s statement followed, in major lines, the Satmar statement released a few days earlier. In January 2007, a group of protesters stood outside the Neturei Karta synagogue in Monsey, New York, demanding that they leave Monsey and move to Iran. Neturei Karta and their supporters from Monsey&#x27;s Orthodox community responded with a counter-protest.

==Factionalism==

In the United States, the Neturei Karta were led by Moshe Ber Beck of Monsey, New York until his death in 2021. They affiliate with the radical branch that was led by Moshe Hirsch. Beck had courted controversy by meeting with Nation of Islam leader Minister Louis Farrakhan, who has been accused of inciting antisemitism and of describing Judaism as a &quot;gutter religion&quot; (Farrakhan says his words were misinterpreted). In addition, after meeting with the representatives from Neturei Karta, Farrakhan indicated he would be more cautious in his choice of words in the future.

===&quot;Sikrikim&quot;===
A radical breakaway faction called &quot;Sikrikim&quot; is based in Israel, mainly in Jerusalem and Beit Shemesh. The group&#x27;s engagement in acts of vandalism, &quot;mafia-like intimidation&quot; and violent protests caused several people, including authority figures, to push for officially labeling them as a terrorist group, along with Neturei Karta.

<text>In finance, discounting is a mechanism in which a debtor obtains the right to delay payments to a creditor, for a defined period of time, in exchange for a charge or fee. Essentially, the party that owes money in the present purchases the right to delay the payment until some future date. This transaction is based on the fact that most people prefer current interest to delayed interest because of mortality effects, impatience effects, and salience effects. The discount, or charge, is the difference between the original amount owed in the present and the amount that has to be paid in the future to settle the debt.

The discount is usually associated with a &quot;discount rate&quot;, which is also called the &quot;discount yield&quot;. The discount yield is the proportional share of the initial amount owed (initial liability) that must be paid to delay payment for 1 year.

formula_1

Since a person can earn a return on money invested over some period of time, most economic and financial models assume the discount yield is the same as the rate of return the person could receive by investing this money elsewhere (in assets of similar risk) over the given period of time covered by the delay in payment. The concept is associated with the opportunity cost of not having use of the money for the period of time covered by the delay in payment. The relationship between the discount yield and the rate of return on other financial assets is usually discussed in economic and financial theories involving the inter-relation between various market prices, and the achievement of Pareto optimality through the operations in the capitalistic price mechanism, as well as in the discussion of the efficient (financial) market hypothesis. The person delaying the payment of the current liability is essentially compensating the person to whom he/she owes money for the lost revenue that could be earned from an investment during the time period covered by the delay in payment. Accordingly, it is the relevant &quot;discount yield&quot; that determines the &quot;discount&quot;, and not the other way around.

As indicated, the rate of return is usually calculated in accordance to an annual return on investment. Since an investor earns a return on the original principal amount of the investment as well as on any prior period investment income, investment earnings are &quot;compounded&quot; as time advances. Therefore, considering the fact that the &quot;discount&quot; must match the benefits obtained from a similar investment asset, the &quot;discount yield&quot; must be used within the same compounding mechanism to negotiate an increase in the size of the &quot;discount&quot; whenever the time period of the payment is delayed or extended. The &quot;discount rate&quot; is the rate at which the &quot;discount&quot; must grow as the delay in payment is extended. This fact is directly tied into the time value of money and its calculations.

The &quot;time value of money&quot; indicates there is a difference between the &quot;future value&quot; of a payment and the &quot;present value&quot; of the same payment. The rate of return on investment should be the dominant factor in evaluating the market&#x27;s assessment of the difference between the future value and the present value of a payment; and it is the market&#x27;s assessment that counts the most. Therefore, the &quot;discount yield&quot;, which is predetermined by a related return on investment that is found in the different markets in the financial sector, is what is used within the time-value-of-money calculations to determine the &quot;discount&quot; required to delay payment of a financial liability for a given period of time.

==Basic calculation==
If we consider the value of the original payment presently due to be &quot;P&quot;, and the debtor wants to delay the payment for &quot;t&quot; years, then a market rate of return denoted &quot;r&quot; on a similar investment asset means the future value of &quot;P&quot; is formula_2, and the discount can be calculated as

: formula_3

We wish to calculate the present value, also known as the &quot;discounted value&quot; of a payment. Note that a payment made in the future is worth less than the same payment made today which could immediately be deposited into a bank account and earn interest, or invest in other assets. Hence we must discount future payments. Consider a payment &quot;F&quot; that is to be made &quot;t&quot; years in the future, we calculate the present value as 

: formula_4

Suppose that we wanted to find the present value, denoted &quot;PV&quot; of $100 that will be received in five years time. If the interest rate &quot;r&quot; is 12% per year then

: formula_5

== Discount rate ==

The discount rate which is used in financial calculations is usually chosen to be equal to the cost of capital. The cost of capital, in a financial market equilibrium, will be the same as the market rate of return on the financial asset mixture the firm uses to finance capital investment. Some adjustment may be made to the discount rate to take account of risks associated with uncertain cash flows, with other developments.

The discount rates typically applied to different types of companies show significant differences:

* Start-ups seeking money: 50–100%
* Early start-ups: 40–60%
* Late start-ups: 30–50%
* Mature companies: 10–25%

The higher discount rate for start-ups reflects the various disadvantages they face, compared to established companies:

* Reduced marketability of ownerships because stocks are not traded publicly
* Small number of investors willing to invest
* High risks associated with start-ups
* Overly optimistic forecasts by enthusiastic founders

One method that looks into a correct discount rate is the capital asset pricing model. This model takes into account three variables that make up the discount rate:

1. Risk free rate: The percentage of return generated by investing in risk free securities such as government bonds.

2. Beta: The measurement of how a company&#x27;s stock price reacts to a change in the market. A beta higher than 1 means that a change in share price is exaggerated compared to the rest of shares in the same market. A beta less than 1 means that the share is stable and not very responsive to changes in the market. Less than 0 means that a share is moving in the opposite direction from the rest of the shares in the same market.

3. Equity market risk premium: The return on investment that investors require above the risk free rate.

: Discount rate = (risk free rate) + beta * (equity market risk premium)

== Discount factor ==

The discount factor, &quot;DF(T)&quot;, is the factor by which a future cash flow must be multiplied in order to obtain the present value. For a zero-rate (also called spot rate) &quot;r&quot;, taken from a yield curve, and a time to cash flow &quot;T&quot; (in years), the discount factor is:

: formula_6

In the case where the only discount rate one has is not a zero-rate (neither taken from a zero-coupon bond nor converted from a swap rate to a zero-rate through bootstrapping) but an annually-compounded rate (for example if the benchmark is a US Treasury bond with annual coupons) and one only has its yield to maturity, one would use an annually-compounded discount factor:

: formula_7

However, when operating in a bank, where the amount the bank can lend (and therefore get interest) is linked to the value of its assets (including accrued interest), traders usually use daily compounding to discount cash flows. Indeed, even if the interest of the bonds it holds (for example) is paid semi-annually, the value of its book of bond will increase daily, thanks to accrued interest being accounted for, and therefore the bank will be able to re-invest these daily accrued interest (by lending additional money or buying more financial products). In that case, the discount factor is then (if the usual money market day count convention for the currency is ACT/360, in case of currencies such as United States dollar, euro, Japanese yen), with &quot;r&quot; the zero-rate and &quot;T&quot; the time to cash flow in years:

: formula_8

or, in case the market convention for the currency being discounted is ACT/365 (AUD, CAD, GBP):

: formula_9

Sometimes, for manual calculation, the continuously-compounded hypothesis is a close-enough approximation of the daily-compounding hypothesis, and makes calculation easier (even though its application is limited to instruments such as financial derivatives). In that case, the discount factor is:

: formula_10

<text>In economics, cash is money in the physical form of currency, such as banknotes and coins.

In bookkeeping and financial accounting, cash is current assets comprising currency or currency equivalents that can be accessed immediately or near-immediately (as in the case of money market accounts). Cash is seen either as a reserve for payments, in case of a structural or incidental negative cash flow or as a way to avoid a downturn on financial markets.

==Etymology==
The English word &quot;cash&quot; originally meant , and later came to have a secondary meaning . This secondary usage became the sole meaning in the 18th century. The word &quot;cash&quot; comes from the Middle French , which comes from the Old Italian , and ultimately from the Latin .

==History==

In Western Europe, after the fall of the Western Roman Empire, coins, silver jewelry and hacksilver (silver objects hacked into pieces) were for centuries the only form of money, until Venetian merchants started using silver bars for large transactions in the early Middle Ages. In a separate development, Venetian merchants started using paper bills, instructing their banker to make payments. Similar marked silver bars were in use in lands where the Venetian merchants had established representative offices. The Byzantine Empire and several states in the Balkan area and Kievan Rus also used marked silver bars for large payments. As the world economy developed and silver supplies increased, in particular after the colonization of South America, coins became larger and a standard coin for international payment developed from the 15th century: the Spanish and Spanish colonial coin of 8 reales. Its counterpart in gold was the Venetian ducat.

Coin types would compete for markets. By conquering foreign markets, the issuing rulers would enjoy extra income from seigniorage (the difference between the value of the coin and the value of the metal the coin was made of). Successful coin types of high nobility would be copied by lower nobility for seigniorage. Imitations were usually of a lower weight, undermining the popularity of the original. As feudal states coalesced into kingdoms, imitation of silver types abated, but gold coins, in particular, the gold ducat and the gold florin were still issued as trade coins: coins without a fixed value, going by weight. Colonial powers also sought to take away market share from Spain by issuing trade coin equivalents of silver Spanish coins, without much success.

In the early part of the 17th century, English East India Company coins were minted in England and shipped to the East. In England, over time the word &quot;cash&quot; was adopted from Sanskrit कर्ष karsa, a weight of gold or silver but akin to the Old Persian karsha, unit of weight (83.30 grams). East India Company coinage had both Urdu and English writing on it, to facilitate its use within the trade. In 1671, the directors of the East India Company ordered a mint to be established at Bombay, known as Bombaim. In 1677 this was sanctioned by the Crown, the coins, having received royal sanction, were struck as silver rupees; the inscription runs &quot;The rupee of Bombaim&quot;, by the authority of Charles II.

Around that time, coins were also being produced for the East India Company at the Madras mint. The Tamil the word for money is kaasu, which may have been modified into &#x27;cash&#x27;. Both words, &#x27;kaasu&#x27; and &#x27;cash&#x27;, have the same meaning, unlike money box. The currency at the company&#x27;s Bombay and Bengal administrative regions was the rupee. At Madras, however, the company&#x27;s accounts were reckoned in &quot;pagodas&quot;, &quot;fractions&quot;, &quot;fanams&quot;, &quot;faluce&quot; and &quot;cash&quot;. This system was maintained until 1818 when the rupee was adopted as the unit of currency for the company&#x27;s operations.
Paper money was first used in China during the Tang dynasty 500 years prior to it catching on in Europe. During his visit to China in the 13th century, Marco Polo was amazed to find that people traded paper money for goods rather than valuable coins made of silver or gold. He wrote extensively about how the Great Kaan used a part of the Mulberry Tree to create the paper money as well as the process with which a seal was used to impress on the paper to authenticate it. Marco Polo also talks about the chance of forgery and states that someone caught forging money would be punished with death. In the 17th century, European countries started to use paper money in part due to a shortage of precious metals, leading to fewer coins being produced and put into circulation. At first, it was most popular in the colonies of European powers. In the 18th century, important paper issues were made in colonies such as Ceylon and the bordering colonies of Essequibo, Demerara and Berbice. John Law did pioneering work on banknotes with the &quot;Banque Royale&quot;. The relation between money supply and inflation was still imperfectly understood and the bank went under rendering its notes worthless, because they had been over-issued. The lessons learned were applied to the Bank of England, which played a crucial role in financing the Peninsular War against French troops, hamstrung by a metallic Franc de Germinal.

The ability to create paper money made nation-states responsible for the management of inflation, through control of the money supply. It also made a direct relation between the metal of the coin and its denomination superfluous. From 1816, coins generally became token money, though some large silver and gold coins remained standard coins until 1927. The World War I saw standard coins disappear to a very large extent. Afterward, standard gold coins, mainly British sovereigns, would still be used in colonies and less developed economies and silver Maria Theresa thalers dated 1780 would be struck as trade coins for countries in East Asia until 1946 and possibly later locally.

Cash has now become a very small part of the money supply. Its remaining role is to provide a form of currency storage and payment for those who do not wish to take part in other systems, and make small payments conveniently and promptly, though this latter role is being replaced more and more frequently by electronic payment systems. Research has found that the demand for cash decreases as debit card usage increases because merchants need to make less change for customer purchases.

Cash is increasing in circulation. The amount of the United States dollar in circulation increased by 42% from 2007 to 2012. The amount of pound sterling banknotes in circulation increased by 29% from 2008 to 2013. The amount of euro in circulation increased by 34% from August 2008 to August 2013 (2% of the increase was due to the adoption of euro in Slovakia 2009 and in Estonia 2011).

==Motives of cash holding==

In economic theory (according Keynesian economics), the cash holding of cash (especially sight deposits) is roughly attributed to three motives:
* Transactions motive
* Precautionary motive
* Speculative motive.

The transactions motive covers the business needs of economic subjects, the precautionary motive serves to hold money for liquidity purposes and to provide for crisis situations, and the speculation motive, according to John Maynard Keynes, results from the uncertainty about future interest rate developments and relates to financial investments.

In addition to this purely economic importance, there are other aspects of cash use:

* Anonymous payment without disclosing personal data
* Trust to the central bank (control and publication of money creation)
* Activation of a reward center in the brain (anticipation of reaching a specific goal)
* Expenditure control (immediate physical payment)
* Tradition (haptic experience, e.g. monetary donation; long-term reliability of value retention)
* Inclusion (equal participation in economic life for all)
* Identification (symbolic character, solidarity and group membership)
* Educational tool for children (objective handling of assets and expenses)
* Paying a tip as immediate recognition of good service.
In practice, there may be a combination of such motives, with the precautionary motive of preserving value and anonymous payment being decisive. Due to its unique characteristics, there is no perfect substitute for cash. Demonetisation or capital control can destabilize the economy if electronic means of payment are not readily available (e.g. 2016 Indian banknote demonetisation).

==Cash in circulation==

Cash in circulation is characterized by strong seasonal fluctuations. Wage and salary payment dates, tax payment dates or holidays lead to statistically perceptible increases in cash in circulation, for which the credit institutions are preparing. Since cash holdings at banks do not earn interest and can also lead to security problems (bank robbery), banks usually only hold very small amounts of cash. They are therefore forced to involve the central bank in times of higher cash requirements. Therefore, the cash in circulation only remains unchanged if the banks hand over cash from their own cash holdings to their bank customers or take cash deposits from their customers into their own holdings.

The ratio of the cash in circulation in relation to the gross domestic product (cash to GDP ratio) is a good indicator of cash usage and payment behavior in an economy. In countries like the United States, increased use of debit and credit cards is increasing the amount of cash in circulation at a slower rate than in countries with a high amount of cash payments. In 2018, it ranged from 1.3% (in Sweden) to more than 21% (in Japan), 10.5% in Switzerland and 10.7% in the eurozone. 

Since around 2018, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, cash in circulation in the eurozone has increased significantly while the share of cash payments (i.e. transactions) has decreased, known as the &quot;paradox of banknotes&quot;. Analyzes show that private households are increasingly keeping cash as a precaution against crises and that negative interest rates also play a role. This effect is also observed in many other currency areas, e.g. in the United States and Japan.

==Banknote tracking==
In most jurisdictions, banknotes are not routinely tracked by serial number. There are the following exceptions in cash applications:
* Registration of ransom money for blackmail (e.g. for the Oetker kidnapping)
* Macroeconomic studies of cash flows through the central bank
* Statistical recording of the lifespan of banknotes by the central bank
* Tracking the (location-based) migration of individual banknotes using EuroBillTracker for euro banknotes, Where&#x27;s George? for US dollars and Where&#x27;s Willy? for Canadian dollars as a hobby
* Use of individual banknotes for sharing messages with recipients using the mobile app &quot;smill&quot;.

Since 2016, the People&#x27;s Bank of China has requested the recording of banknotes issued and deposited at ATMs and bank counters, arguing that counterfeit money will be prosecuted. 

With Directive ECB/2010/14, the European Central Bank (ECB) requires banks to check the authenticity of deposited and withdrawn banknotes at bank counters and ATMs using tested devices. They are required to trace the origin of suspected counterfeit banknotes to the depositing account holder. They must also physically seize any counterfeit notes and coins.

==Competition of cash==

===Cashless payments===
Cashless society can be defined as one in which all financial transactions are handled through &quot;digital&quot; forms (debit and credit cards) in preference to cash (physical banknotes and coins). Cashless societies have been a part of history from the very beginning of human existence. Barter and other methods of exchange were used to conduct a wide variety of trade transactions during this time period.

Since the 1980s, the use of banknotes has increasingly been displaced by credit and debit cards, electronic money transfers and mobile payments, but much slower than expected. The cashless society has been predicted for more than forty years, but cash remains the most widely used payment instrument in the world and on all continents. In 17 out of 24 studied countries, cash represents more than 50% of all payment transactions, with Austria at 85%, Germany at 80%, France at 68%. The United Kingdom at 42%, Australia at 37%, United States at 32%, Sweden at 20%, and South Korea at 14% are among the countries with lower cash usage.

By the 2010s, cash was no longer the preferred method of payment in the United States. In 2016, the United States User Consumer Survey Study reported that three out of four of the participants preferred a debit or credit card payment instead of cash. Some nations have contributed to this trend, by regulating what type of transactions can be conducted with cash and setting limits on the amount of cash that can be used in a single transaction.

Cash is still the primary means of payment (and store of value) for unbanked people with a low income and helps avoiding debt traps due to uncontrolled spending of money. It supports anonymity and avoids tracking for economic or political reasons. In addition, cash is the only means for contingency planning in order to mitigate risks in case of natural disasters or failures of the technical infrastructure like a large-scale power blackout or shutdown of the communication network. Therefore, central banks and governments are increasingly driving the sufficient availability of cash. The US Federal Reserve has provided guidelines for the continuity of cash services, and the Swedish government is concerned about the consequences in abandoning cash and is considering to pass a law requiring all banks to handle cash.

===Digital and virtual currencies===

Digital currency is a generic term for various approaches to support secure transactions of the public or using a distributed ledger, like blockchain, as a new technology for decentralized asset management. The blockchain 1.0 era has enabled the application of virtual digital currencies in the marketplace, such as money transfer and payment systems. It considers establishing an electronic version of the national currency which is backed by the central bank as the issuer. Virtual currency is a digital representation of value that is neither issued by a central bank or a public authority, such as Bitcoin. Facebook&#x27;s concept for the diem is based on a token to be backed by financial assets such as a basket of national currencies. 

In 2012, Bank of Canada was considering introducing digital currency. Meanwhile, it rates digital currency a fairly complicated decision and is analyzing the pros and cons and working to determine under which conditions it may make sense to, one day, issue a digital currency. As a threat, a central bank digital currency could increase the risk of a run on the banking system.

Also in 2012, Sveriges Riksbank, the central bank of Sweden, was reported to analyze technological advances with regard to electronic money and payment methods for digital currency as an alternative to cash. In 2019, it is investigating whether Swedish krona need to be made available in electronic form, the so-called e-krona, and if so, how it would affect Swedish legislation and the Riksbank&#x27;s task. It has started procuring a technical supplier to develop and test solutions for a potential future e-krona. No decisions have yet been taken on issuing an e-krona.

===Costs of payment===
An analysis by the Deutsche Bundesbank in 2017 found that a cash payment in retail costs an average of 24 euro cents, while payments with a girocard cost 30 cents (or often 0.3 to 0.4% of sales plus a transaction fee) and with a credit card charge one euro which is included in the sales price. This is why retailers often refuse to accept card payments below a minimum amount. Depending on the account model, there are also booking costs for the account holder with an average of 35 euro cents charged for each(!) account posting. Because of this convenient source of income, commercial banks and credit card companies favor cashless payments.

In the case of cashless payment transactions, in addition to the documentation of the payment itself, the personal details of the payer are usually linked to the data of the payee according to the Know Your Customer (KYC) principle. This enables the payment process to be precisely traced for the payer and the payee. The constant increase in digitization leads to a more detailed recording of cashless payment transactions and their evaluation for advertising and marketing campaigns. Since this digital documentation is usually more centralized than before, the potential for abuse increases. On the other hand, the cash transactions are anonymous, unless purchasing profiles are recorded with the help of loyalty programs based on customer cards, and keep the payment landscape competitive.

==Cash in constitutions==
===Austria===
In August 2023, Chancellor of Austria Karl Nehammer came out in support for enshrining cash in the Austrian constitution. This came after the Freedom Party of Austria campaigned on the idea.

===Switzerland===
In 2023, The Swiss government supported moves to have a constitutional protection for cash. This came after a popular initiative asked for it.

===Slovakia===
In June 2023, the Slovakian parliament voted with the support of 111 of 150 MPs to put the right to use cash in the Constitution of Slovakia. The amendment was proposed by the Sme Rodina party.

<text>Song Zheyuan (; October 30, 1885 – April 5, 1940) was a Chinese general during the Chinese Civil War and Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945).

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Born in the village of Zhaohong, northwest of the seat of Laoling County, Shandong, he was educated under his uncle from his mother&#x27;s side, a teacher of a traditional Confucian private school in Yanshan County. At the age of 20 (1904) he began studying in the military institute founded by Lu Jianzhang at Beijing and had since become Lu&#x27;s favorite. In 1912 the troops of Lu and Feng Yuxiang, now subordinates of Yuan Shikai, were regrouped and Feng had then been Song&#x27;s superior.

===Military career===
In 1917, a year after being appointed the head of 1st battalion of Feng&#x27;s 2nd regiment, his battalion spearheaded the removal of Zhang Xun from his imperial restoration in 1917. As part of the Guominjun he became Governor of Jehol Province in 1926. Following the defeat of the Guominjun in the Anti–Fengtian War Feng Yuxiang participated in the Northern Expedition, Sòng assumed the Chairmanship of Shaanxi province in November 1927 and in April of the same year the head of 4th division under the II Corps of the National Revolutionary Army.

Switching sides to the Kuomintang after the abortive coup d&#x27;état in 1930 of Feng against Chiang Kai-shek, his troops were designated as the 29th Army and garrisoned in southern Shanxi province where he was responsible for the frontiers of the Rehe and Chahar provinces against the Japanese in Manchukuo.

==Chair of Chahar province==
Song was the chairman of Chahar province when Japan invaded the provinces in the end of year 1932. Though poorly equipped compared to the better armed Japanese, Song led the 29th army to resist the aggression in a war known as the Defense of the Great Wall (熱河長城之戰). Japanese troops then entered the suburbs of Beijing and Tianjin after the predictable victory. Song was relieved from his post but reinstalled as commander after the He–Umezu Agreement.

==Later years==
In the Battle of Lugou Bridge, his 29th Army bore the brunt of the Japanese Kwantung Army. His troops were halved after the defeat and chased by the Japanese along the Jinpu Railway into Shandong Province during the Beiping–Hankou Railway Operation. However Han Fuqu, chairman of the province and suspected for his clandestine Japanese liaison, forbade Song to retreat across the Yellow River, resulting in the 29th Army being shattered at Shijiazhuang in December 1937 and January 1938. Remaining forces suffered various losses against the Imperial Japanese Army and were delegated to guerrilla combat after retreating into the mountainous regions at the borders of Henan and Shanxi province in February 1938.

He soon suffered various illnesses and died at the age of 54 in Mianyang County, Sichuan province after several unsuccessful medical treatments in Guilin, Chongqing, and Chengdu.

<text>Hermann Huppen (born 17 July 1938) is a Belgian comic book creator. He is better known under his pen-name Hermann. He is most famous for his post-apocalyptic comic &quot;Jeremiah&quot; which was made into a television series.

==Biography==
Hermann was born in 1938 in Bévercé (now a part of Malmedy) in Liège Province. After studying to become a furniture maker and working as interior architect, Hermann made his debut as comic book artist in 1964 in the Franco-Belgian comics magazine &quot;Spirou&quot; with a four-page story. Greg noticed his talent and offered him to work for his studio. In 1966, he began illustrating the &quot;Bernard Prince&quot; series written by Greg, published in &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine. In 1969, also in collaboration with Greg, he began the western series &quot;Comanche&quot;. This appeared at the same time as other western series such as &quot;Blueberry&quot;.

Hermann began writing his own stories in 1977, starting the post-apocalyptic &quot;Jeremiah&quot; series, which is still produced today. In the same period, he also made three albums of &quot;Nick&quot;, inspired by &quot;Little Nemo in Slumberland&quot;, for &quot;Spirou&quot;. In 1983 he began a new series, &quot;Les Tours de Bois-Maury&quot;, which is set in the Middle Ages and is less focused on action than his other works.

Hermann has also created many non-series graphic novels sometimes together with his son Yves H. One of them, &quot;Lune de Guerre&quot;, with a story by Jean Van Hamme, was later filmed as &quot;&quot; by Dominique Deruddere.

Hermann is characterized by a realistic style and stories that are both somber and angry, with a sense of disillusion with regards to the human character in general, and current society more specifically.

<doc id="55345" wikidata="Q192472" url="?curid=55345" title="Net present value">
<text>The net present value (NPV) or net present worth (NPW) is a way of measuring the value of an asset that has cashflow by adding up the present value of all the future cash flows that asset will generate. The present value of a cash flow depends on the interval of time between now and the cash flow because of the Time value of money (which includes the annual effective discount rate). It provides a method for evaluating and comparing capital projects or financial products with cash flows spread over time, as in loans, investments, payouts from insurance contracts plus many other applications.

Time value of money dictates that time affects the value of cash flows. For example, a lender may offer 99 cents for the promise of receiving $1.00 a month from now, but the promise to receive that same dollar 20 years in the future would be worth much less today to that same person (lender), even if the payback in both cases was equally certain. This decrease in the current value of future cash flows is based on a chosen rate of return (or discount rate). If for example there exists a time series of identical cash flows, the cash flow in the present is the most valuable, with each future cash flow becoming less valuable than the previous cash flow. A cash flow today is more valuable than an identical cash flow in the future because a present flow can be invested immediately and begin earning returns, while a future flow cannot.

NPV is determined by calculating the costs (negative cash flows) and benefits (positive cash flows) for each period of an investment. After the cash flow for each period is calculated, the present value (PV) of each one is achieved by discounting its future value (see Formula) at a periodic rate of return (the rate of return dictated by the market). NPV is the sum of all the discounted future cash flows.

Because of its simplicity, NPV is a useful tool to determine whether a project or investment will result in a net profit or a loss. A positive NPV results in profit, while a negative NPV results in a loss. The NPV measures the excess or shortfall of cash flows, in present value terms, above the cost of funds. In a theoretical situation of unlimited capital budgeting, a company should pursue every investment with a positive NPV. However, in practical terms a company&#x27;s capital constraints limit investments to projects with the highest NPV whose cost cash flows, or initial cash investment, do not exceed the company&#x27;s capital. NPV is a central tool in discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis and is a standard method for using the time value of money to appraise long-term projects. It is widely used throughout economics, financial analysis, and financial accounting.

In the case when all future cash flows are positive, or incoming (such as the principal and coupon payment of a bond) the only outflow of cash is the purchase price, the NPV is simply the PV of future cash flows minus the purchase price (which is its own PV). NPV can be described as the &quot;difference amount&quot; between the sums of discounted cash inflows and cash outflows. It compares the present value of money today to the present value of money in the future, taking inflation and returns into account.

The NPV of a sequence of cash flows takes as input the cash flows and a discount rate or discount curve and outputs a present value, which is the current fair price. The converse process in discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis takes a sequence of cash flows and a price as input and as output the discount rate, or internal rate of return (IRR) which would yield the given price as NPV. This rate, called the yield, is widely used in bond trading.

== Formula ==
Each cash inflow/outflow is discounted back to its present value (PV). Then all are summed such that NPV is the sum of all terms:
formula_1
where:
* is the time of the cash flow
* is the discount rate, i.e. the return that could be earned per unit of time on an investment with similar risk
* formula_2 is the net cash flow i.e. cash inflow – cash outflow, at time &quot;t&quot;. For educational purposes, formula_3 is commonly placed to the left of the sum to emphasize its role as (minus) the investment.
* formula_4 is the discount factor, also known as the present value factor.

The result of this formula is multiplied with the Annual Net cash in-flows and reduced by Initial Cash outlay the present value, but in cases where the cash flows are not equal in amount, the previous formula will be used to determine the present value of each cash flow separately. Any cash flow within 12 months will not be discounted for NPV purpose, nevertheless the usual initial investments during the first year &quot;R&quot;0 are summed up a negative cash flow.

The NPV can also be thought of as the difference between the discounted benefits and costs over time. As such, the NPV can also be written as:

:formula_5

where:
* are the benefits or cash inflows
* are the costs or cash outflows

Given the (period, cash inflows, cash outflows) shown by (, formula_6, formula_7) where is the total number of periods, the net present value formula_8 is given by:

:formula_9

where:
* formula_6 are the benefits or cash inflows at time .
* formula_7 are the costs or cash outflows at time .
The NPV can be rewritten using the net cash flow formula_12 in each time period as:formula_13By convention, the initial period occurs at time formula_14, where cash flows in successive periods are then discounted from formula_15 and so on. Furthermore, all future cash flows during a period are assumed to be at the end of each period. For constant cash flow , the net present value formula_8 is a finite geometric series and is given by:

formula_17

Inclusion of the formula_3 term is important in the above formulae. A typical capital project involves a large negative formula_3 cashflow (the initial investment) with positive future cashflows (the return on the investment). A key assessment is whether, for a given discount rate, the NPV is positive (profitable) or negative (loss-making). The IRR is the discount rate for which the NPV is exactly 0.

==Capital efficiency==

The NPV method can be slightly adjusted to calculate how much money is contributed to a project&#x27;s investment per dollar invested. This is known as the capital efficiency ratio. The formula for the net present value per dollar investment (NPVI) is given below:

:formula_20

where:
* formula_2 is the net cash flow i.e. cash inflow – cash outflow, at time &quot;t&quot;.
* formula_7 are the net cash outflows, at time &quot;t&quot;.

===Example===

If the discounted benefits across the life of a project are and the discounted net costs across the life of a project are then the NPVI is:

That is for every dollar invested in the project, a contribution of is made to the project&#x27;s NPV.

== Alternative discounting frequencies ==

The NPV formula assumes that the benefits and costs occur at the end of each period, resulting in a more conservative NPV. However, it may be that the cash inflows and outflows occur at the beginning of the period or in the middle of the period.

The NPV formula for mid period discounting is given by:

:formula_23

Over a project&#x27;s lifecycle, cash flows are typically spread across each period (for example spread across each year), and as such the middle of the year represents the average point in time in which these cash flows occur. Hence mid period discounting typically provides a more accurate, although less conservative NPV.
ЧикЙ
The NPV formula using beginning of period discounting is given by:

:formula_24

This results in the least conservative NPV.

== The discount rate ==

The rate used to discount future cash flows to the present value is a key variable of this process.

A firm&#x27;s weighted average cost of capital (after tax) is often used, but many people believe that it is appropriate to use higher discount rates to adjust for risk, opportunity cost, or other factors. A variable discount rate with higher rates applied to cash flows occurring further along the time span might be used to reflect the yield curve premium for long-term debt.

Another approach to choosing the discount rate factor is to decide the rate which the capital needed for the project could return if invested in an alternative venture. If, for example, the capital required for Project A can earn 5% elsewhere, use this discount rate in the NPV calculation to allow a direct comparison to be made between Project A and the alternative. Related to this concept is to use the firm&#x27;s reinvestment rate. Re-investment rate can be defined as the rate of return for the firm&#x27;s investments on average. When analyzing projects in a capital constrained environment, it may be appropriate to use the reinvestment rate rather than the firm&#x27;s weighted average cost of capital as the discount factor. It reflects opportunity cost of investment, rather than the possibly lower cost of capital.

An NPV calculated using variable discount rates (if they are known for the duration of the investment) may better reflect the situation than one calculated from a constant discount rate for the entire investment duration. Refer to the tutorial article written by Samuel Baker for more detailed relationship between the NPV and the discount rate.

For some professional investors, their investment funds are committed to target a specified rate of return. In such cases, that rate of return should be selected as the discount rate for the NPV calculation. In this way, a direct comparison can be made between the profitability of the project and the desired rate of return.

To some extent, the selection of the discount rate is dependent on the use to which it will be put. If the intent is simply to determine whether a project will add value to the company, using the firm&#x27;s weighted average cost of capital may be appropriate. If trying to decide between alternative investments in order to maximize the value of the firm, the corporate reinvestment rate would probably be a better choice.

===Risk-adjusted net present value (rNPV)===

Using variable rates over time, or discounting &quot;guaranteed&quot; cash flows differently from &quot;at risk&quot; cash flows, may be a superior methodology but is seldom used in practice. Using the discount rate to adjust for risk is often difficult to do in practice (especially internationally) and is difficult to do well.

An alternative to using discount factor to adjust for risk is to explicitly correct the cash flows for the risk elements using risk-adjusted net present value (rNPV) or a similar method, then discount at the firm&#x27;s rate.

== Use in decision making ==
NPV is an indicator of how much value an investment or project adds to the firm. With a particular project, if formula_2 is a positive value, the project is in the status of positive cash inflow in the time of &quot;t&quot;. If formula_2 is a negative value, the project is in the status of discounted cash outflow in the time of &quot;t&quot;. Appropriately risked projects with a positive NPV could be accepted. This does not necessarily mean that they should be undertaken since NPV at the cost of capital may not account for opportunity cost, i.e., comparison with other available investments. In financial theory, if there is a choice between two mutually exclusive alternatives, the one yielding the higher NPV should be selected. A positive net present value indicates that the projected earnings generated by a project or investment (in present dollars) exceeds the anticipated costs (also in present dollars). This concept is the basis for the Net Present Value Rule, which dictates that the only investments that should be made are those with positive NPVs.

An investment with a positive NPV is profitable, but one with a negative NPV will not necessarily result in a net loss: it is just that the internal rate of return of the project falls below the required rate of return.

==Advantages and disadvantages of using Net Present Value==
NPV is an indicator for project investments, and has several advantages and disadvantages for decision-making.

===Advantages===
The NPV includes all relevant time and cash flows for the project by considering the time value of money, which is consistent with the goal of wealth maximization by creating the highest wealth for shareholders.

The NPV formula accounts for cash flow timing patterns and size differences for each project, and provides an easy, unambiguous dollar value comparison of different investment options.

The NPV can be easily calculated using modern spreadsheets, under the assumption that the discount rate and future cash flows are known. For a firm considering investing in multiple projects, the NPV has the benefit of being additive. That is, the NPVs of different projects may be aggregated to calculate the highest wealth creation, based on the available capital that can be invested by a firm.

===Disadvantages===

The NPV method has several disadvantages.

The NPV approach does not consider hidden costs and project size. Thus, investment decisions on projects with substantial hidden costs may not be accurate.

====Relies on input parameters such as knowledge of future cash flows====
The NPV is heavily dependent on knowledge of future cash flows, their timing, the length of a project, the initial investment required, and the discount rate. Hence, it can only be accurate if these input parameters are correct; although, sensitivity analyzes can be undertaken to examine how the NPV changes as the input variables are changed, thus reducing the uncertainty of the NPV.

====Relies on choice of discount rate and discount factor====
The accuracy of the NPV method relies heavily on the choice of a discount rate and hence discount factor, representing an investment&#x27;s true risk premium. The discount rate is assumed to be constant over the life of an investment; however, discount rates can change over time. For example, discount rates can change as the cost of capital changes. There are other drawbacks to the NPV method, such as the fact that it displays a lack of consideration for a project’s size and the cost of capital.

====Lack of consideration of non-financial metrics====
The NPV calculation is purely financial and thus does not consider non-financial metrics that may be relevant to an investment decision.

====Difficulty in comparing mutually exclusive projects====
Comparing mutually exclusive projects with different investment horizons can be difficult. Since unequal projects are all assumed to have duplicate investment horizons, the NPV approach can be used to compare the optimal duration NPV.

== Interpretation as integral transform ==
The time-discrete formula of the net present value
: formula_27

can also be written in a continuous variation
: formula_28
where
:&quot;r&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is the rate of flowing cash given in money per time, and &quot;r&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) = 0 when the investment is over.

Net present value can be regarded as Laplace- respectively Z-transformed cash flow with the integral operator including the complex number &quot;s&quot; which resembles to the interest rate &quot;i&quot; from the real number space or more precisely &quot;s&quot; = ln(1 + &quot;i&quot;).

: formula_29

From this follow simplifications known from cybernetics, control theory and system dynamics. Imaginary parts of the complex number &quot;s&quot; describe the oscillating behaviour (compare with the pork cycle, cobweb theorem, and phase shift between commodity price and supply offer) whereas real parts are responsible for representing the effect of compound interest (compare with damping).

== Example ==

A corporation must decide whether to introduce a new product line. The company will have immediate costs of 100,000 at . Recall, a cost is a negative for outgoing cash flow, thus this cash flow is represented as −100,000. The company assumes the product will provide equal benefits of 10,000 for each of 12 years beginning at . For simplicity, assume the company will have no outgoing cash flows after the initial 100,000 cost. This also makes the simplifying assumption that the net cash received or paid is lumped into a single transaction occurring &quot;on the last day&quot; of each year. At the end of the 12 years the product no longer provides any cash flow and is discontinued without any additional costs. Assume that the effective annual discount rate is 10%.

The present value (value at ) can be calculated for each year:
The total present value of the incoming cash flows is 68,136.91. The total present value of the outgoing cash flows is simply the 100,000 at time .
Thus:

: formula_30

In this example:

: formula_31

Observe that as &quot;t&quot; increases the present value of each cash flow at &quot;t&quot; decreases. For example, the final incoming cash flow has a future value of 10,000 at but has a present value (at ) of 3,186.31. The opposite of discounting is compounding. Taking the example in reverse, it is the equivalent of investing 3,186.31 at (the present value) at an interest rate of 10% compounded for 12 years, which results in a cash flow of 10,000 at (the future value).

The importance of NPV becomes clear in this instance. Although the incoming cash flows () appear to exceed the outgoing cash flow (100,000), the future cash flows are not adjusted using the discount rate. Thus, the project appears misleadingly profitable. When the cash flows are discounted however, it indicates the project would result in a net loss of 31,863.09. Thus, the NPV calculation indicates that this project should be disregarded because investing in this project is the equivalent of a loss of 31,863.09 at . The concept of time value of money indicates that cash flows in different periods of time cannot be accurately compared unless they have been adjusted to reflect their value at the same period of time (in this instance, ). It is the present value of each future cash flow that must be determined in order to provide any meaningful comparison between cash flows at different periods of time. There are a few inherent assumptions in this type of analysis:

# The &quot;investment horizon&quot; of all possible investment projects considered are equally acceptable to the investor (e.g. a 3-year project is not necessarily preferable vs. a 20-year project.)
# The 10% discount rate is the appropriate (and stable) rate to discount the expected cash flows from each project being considered. Each project is assumed equally speculative.
# The shareholders cannot get above a 10% return on their money if they were to directly assume an equivalent level of risk. (If the investor could do better elsewhere, no projects should be undertaken by the firm, and the excess capital should be turned over to the shareholder through dividends and stock repurchases.)

More realistic problems would also need to consider other factors, generally including: smaller time buckets, the calculation of taxes (including the cash flow timing), inflation, currency exchange fluctuations, hedged or unhedged commodity costs, risks of technical obsolescence, potential future competitive factors, uneven or unpredictable cash flows, and a more realistic salvage value assumption, as well as many others.

A more simple example of the net present value of incoming cash flow over a set period of time, would be winning a Powerball lottery of . If one does not select the &quot;CASH&quot; option they will be paid per year for 20 years, a total of , however, if one does select the &quot;CASH&quot; option, they will receive a one-time lump sum payment of approximately , the NPV of paid over time. See &quot;other factors&quot; above that could affect the payment amount. Both scenarios are before taxes.

== Common pitfalls ==

* If, for example, the &quot;R&quot;&quot;t&quot; are generally negative late in the project (&quot;e.g.&quot;, an industrial or mining project might have clean-up and restoration costs), then at that stage the company owes money, so a high discount rate is not cautious but too optimistic. Some people see this as a problem with NPV. A way to avoid this problem is to include explicit provision for financing any losses after the initial investment, that is, explicitly calculate the cost of financing such losses.
* Another common pitfall is to adjust for risk by adding a premium to the discount rate. Whilst a bank might charge a higher rate of interest for a risky project, that does not mean that this is a valid approach to adjusting a net present value for risk, although it can be a reasonable approximation in some specific cases. One reason such an approach may not work well can be seen from the following: if some risk is incurred resulting in some losses, then a discount rate in the NPV will reduce the effect of such losses below their true financial cost. A rigorous approach to risk requires identifying and valuing risks explicitly, &quot;e.g.&quot;, by actuarial or Monte Carlo techniques, and explicitly calculating the cost of financing any losses incurred.
* Yet another issue can result from the compounding of the risk premium. R is a composite of the risk free rate and the risk premium. As a result, future cash flows are discounted by both the risk-free rate as well as the risk premium and this effect is compounded by each subsequent cash flow. This compounding results in a much lower NPV than might be otherwise calculated. The certainty equivalent model can be used to account for the risk premium without compounding its effect on present value.
* Another issue with relying on NPV is that it does not provide an overall picture of the gain or loss of executing a certain project. To see a percentage gain relative to the investments for the project, usually, Internal rate of return or other efficiency measures are used as a complement to NPV.
* Non-specialist users frequently make the error of computing NPV based on cash flows after interest. This is wrong because it double counts the time value of money. Free cash flow should be used as the basis for NPV computations.
* When using Microsoft&#x27;s Excel, the &quot;=NPV(...)&quot; formula makes two assumptions that result in an incorrect solution. The first is that the amount of time between each item in the input array is constant and equidistant (e.g., 30 days of time between item 1 and item 2) which may not always be correct based on the cash flow that is being discounted. The second item is that the function will assume the item in the first position of the array is period 1 not period zero. This then results in incorrectly discounting all array items by one extra period. The easiest fix to both of these errors is to use the &quot;=XNPV(...)&quot; formula.

==Software support==
Many computer-based spreadsheet programs have built-in formulae for PV and NPV.

== History ==
Net present value as a valuation methodology dates at least to the 19th century. Karl Marx refers to NPV as fictitious capital, and the calculation as &quot;capitalising,&quot; writing:

In mainstream neo-classical economics, NPV was formalized and popularized by Irving Fisher, in his 1907 &quot;The Rate of Interest&quot; and became included in textbooks from the 1950s onwards, starting in finance texts.

== Alternative capital budgeting methods ==

* Adjusted present value (APV): adjusted present value, is the net present value of a project if financed solely by ownership equity plus the present value of all the benefits of financing.
* Accounting rate of return (ARR): a ratio similar to IRR and MIRR
* Cost-benefit analysis: which includes issues other than cash, such as time savings.
* Internal rate of return (IRR): which calculates the rate of return of a project while disregarding the absolute amount of money to be gained.
* Modified internal rate of return (MIRR): similar to IRR, but it makes explicit assumptions about the reinvestment of the cash flows. Sometimes it is called Growth Rate of Return.
* Payback period: which measures the time required for the cash inflows to equal the original outlay. It measures risk, not return.
* Real option: which attempts to value managerial flexibility that is assumed away in NPV.
* Equivalent annual cost (EAC): a capital budgeting technique that is useful in comparing two or more projects with different lifespans.

<text>Hierarchical File System (HFS) is a proprietary file system developed by Apple Inc. for use in computer systems running Mac OS. Originally designed for use on floppy and hard disks, it can also be found on read-only media such as CD-ROMs. HFS is also referred to as Mac OS Standard (or HFS Standard), while its successor, HFS Plus, is also called Mac OS Extended (or HFS Extended).

With the introduction of Mac OS X 10.6, Apple dropped support for formatting or writing HFS disks and images, which remained supported as read-only volumes until macOS 10.15. Starting with macOS 10.15, HFS disks can no longer be read.

== History ==
Apple introduced HFS in September 1985, specifically to support Apple&#x27;s first hard disk drive for the Macintosh, replacing the Macintosh File System (MFS), the original file system which had been introduced over a year and a half earlier with the first Macintosh computer. HFS drew heavily upon Apple&#x27;s first operating system with a hierarchical file system, SOS for the failed Apple III, which also served as the basis for hierarchical file systems on the Apple IIe and Apple Lisa. HFS was developed by Patrick Dirks and Bill Bruffey. It shared a number of design features with MFS that were not available in other file systems of the time (such as DOS&#x27;s FAT). Files could have multiple forks (normally a data and a resource fork), which allowed the main data of the file to be stored separately from resources such as icons that might need to be localized. Files were referenced with unique file IDs rather than file names, and file names could be up to 31 characters long.

However, MFS had been optimized to be used on very small and slow media, namely floppy disks, so HFS was introduced to overcome some of the performance problems that arrived with the introduction of larger media, notably hard drives. The main concern was the time needed to display the contents of a folder. Under MFS all of the file and directory listing information was stored in a single file, which the system had to search to build a list of the files stored in a particular folder. This worked well with a system with a few hundred kilobytes of storage and perhaps a hundred files, but as the systems grew into megabytes and thousands of files, the performance degraded rapidly.

The solution was to replace MFS&#x27;s directory structure with one more suitable to larger file systems. HFS replaced the flat table structure with the &quot;Catalog File&quot; which uses a B-tree structure that could be searched very quickly regardless of size. HFS also redesigned various structures to be able to hold larger numbers, 16-bit integers being replaced by 32-bit almost universally. Oddly, one of the few places this &quot;upsizing&quot; did not take place was the file directory itself, which limits HFS to a total of 65,535 files on each logical disk.

While HFS is a proprietary file system format, it is well-documented; there are usually solutions available to access HFS-formatted disks from most modern operating systems.

Apple introduced HFS out of necessity with its first 20 MB hard disk offering for the Macintosh in September 1985, where it was loaded into RAM from a MFS floppy disk on boot using a patch file (&quot;Hard Disk 20&quot;). However, HFS was not widely introduced until it was included in the 128K ROM that debuted with the Macintosh Plus in January 1986 along with the larger 800 KB floppy disk drive for the Macintosh that also used HFS. The introduction of HFS was the first advancement by Apple to leave a Macintosh computer model behind: the original 128K Macintosh, which lacked sufficient memory to load the HFS code and was promptly discontinued.

In 1998, Apple introduced HFS Plus to address inefficient allocation of disk space in HFS and to add other improvements. HFS Plus is still supported by current versions of Mac OS, but starting with Mac OS X, an HFS volume cannot be used for booting, and beginning with Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard), HFS volumes are read-only and cannot be created or updated. In macOS Sierra (10.12), Apple&#x27;s release notes state that &quot;The HFS Standard filesystem is no longer supported.&quot; However, read-only HFS Standard support continued to work until the release of macOS 10.15, ending official support for classic HFS Standard after 35 years.

==Design==
A storage volume is inherently divided into &quot;logical blocks&quot; of 512 bytes. The Hierarchical File System groups these logical blocks into &quot;allocation blocks&quot;, which can contain one or more logical blocks, depending on the total size of the volume. HFS uses a 16-bit value to address allocation blocks, limiting the number of allocation blocks to 65,535 (216-1).

Five structures make up an HFS volume:
# Logical blocks 0 and 1 of the volume are the Boot Blocks, which contain system startup information. For example, the names of the System and Shell (usually the Finder) files which are loaded at startup.
# Logical block 2 contains the Master Directory Block (also known as MDB). This defines a wide variety of data about the volume itself, for example date &amp; time stamps for when the volume was created, the location of the other volume structures such as the Volume Bitmap or the size of logical structures such as allocation blocks. There is also a duplicate of the MDB called the Alternate Master Directory Block (also known as Alternate MDB) located at the opposite end of the volume in the second to last logical block. This is intended mainly for use by disk utilities and is only updated when either the Catalog File or Extents Overflow File grow in size.
# Logical block 3 is the starting block of the Volume Bitmap, which keeps track of which allocation blocks are in use and which are free. Each allocation block on the volume is represented by a bit in the map: if the bit is set then the block is in use; if it is clear then the block is free to be used. Since the Volume Bitmap must have a bit to represent each allocation block, its size is determined by the size of the volume itself.
# The Extent Overflow File is a B-tree that contains extra extents that record which allocation blocks are allocated to which files, once the initial three extents in the Catalog File are used up. Later versions also added the ability for the Extent Overflow File to store extents that record bad blocks, to prevent the file system from trying to allocate a bad block to a file.
# The Catalog File is another B-tree that contains records for all the files and directories stored in the volume. It stores four types of records. Each file consists of a File Thread Record and a File Record while each directory consists of a Directory Thread Record and a Directory Record. Files and directories in the Catalog File are located by their unique Catalog Node ID (or CNID).
#* A File Thread Record stores just the name of the file and the CNID of its parent directory.
#* A File Record stores a variety of metadata about the file including its CNID, the size of the file, three timestamps (when the file was created, last modified, last backed up), the first file extents of the data and resource forks and pointers to the file&#x27;s first data and resource extent records in the Extent Overflow File. The File Record also stores two 16 byte fields that are used by the Finder to store attributes about the file including things like its creator code, type code, the window the file should appear in and its location within the window.
#* A Directory Thread Record stores just the name of the directory and the CNID of its parent directory.
#* A Directory Record which stores data like the number of files stored within the directory, the CNID of the directory, three timestamps (when the directory was created, last modified, last backed up). Like the File Record, the Directory Record also stores two 16 byte fields for use by the Finder. These store things like the width &amp; height and x &amp; y co-ordinates for the window used to display the contents of the directory, the display mode (icon view, list view, etc.) of the window and the position of the window&#x27;s scroll bar.

== Limitations ==
The Catalog File, which stores all the file and directory records in a single data structure, results in performance problems when the system allows multitasking, as only one program can write to this structure at a time, meaning that many programs may be waiting in queue due to one program &quot;hogging&quot; the system. It is also a serious reliability concern, as damage to this file can destroy the entire file system. This contrasts with other file systems that store file and directory records in separate structures (such as DOS&#x27;s FAT file system or the Unix File System), where having structure distributed across the disk means that damaging a single directory is generally non-fatal and the data may possibly be re-constructed with data held in the non-damaged portions.

Additionally, the limit of 65,535 allocation blocks resulted in files having a &quot;minimum&quot; size equivalent 1/65,535th the size of the disk. Thus, any given volume, no matter its size, could only store a maximum of 65,535 files. Moreover, any file would be allocated more space than it actually needed, up to the allocation block size. When disks were small, this was of little consequence, because the individual allocation block size was trivial, but as disks started to approach the 1 GB mark, the smallest amount of space that any file could occupy (a single allocation block) became excessively large, wasting significant amounts of disk space. For example, on a 1 GB disk, the allocation block size under HFS is 16 KB, so even a 1 byte file would take up 16 KB of disk space. This situation was less of a problem for users having large files (such as pictures, databases or audio) because these larger files wasted less space as a percentage of their file size. Users with many small files, on the other hand, could lose a copious amount of space due to large allocation block size. This made partitioning disks into smaller logical volumes very appealing for Mac users, because small documents stored on a smaller volume would take up much less space than if they resided on a large partition. The same problem existed in the FAT16 file system.

HFS saves the case of a file that is created or renamed but is case-insensitive in operation.

<text>Elevator music (also known as [[Muzak]], piped music, or lift music) is a type of background music played in elevators, in rooms where many people come together for reasons other than listening to music, and during telephone calls when placed on hold. Before the emergence of the Internet, such music was often &quot;piped&quot; to businesses and homes through telephone lines, private networks or targeted radio broadcasting (as in the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Music While You Work&quot;, where powerful speakers were set up in factories to make the broadcast audible).

There is no specific sound associated with elevator music, but it usually involves simple instrumental themes from &quot;soft&quot; popular music, or &quot;light&quot; classical music being performed by slow strings. This type of music was produced, for instance, by the Mantovani Orchestra, and conductors such as Franck Pourcel and James Last, peaking in popularity around the 1970s.

More recent types of elevator music may be computer-generated, with the actual score being composed entirely algorithmically.

==Other uses==
The term can also be used for kinds of easy listening, lounge, piano solo, jazz or middle of the road music, or what are known as &quot;beautiful music&quot; radio stations.

This style of music is sometimes used to comedic effect in mass media such as film, where intense or dramatic scenes may be interrupted or interspersed with such anodyne music while characters use an elevator. Some video games have used music similarly: &quot;Metal Gear Solid 4&quot; where a few elevator music-themed tracks are accessible on the in-game iPod, as well as &quot;System Shock&quot;, &quot;Rise of the Triad: Dark War&quot;, &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot;, &quot;Mass Effect&quot;, and &quot;Earthworm Jim&quot;.

<text>A RAM drive (also called a RAM disk) is a block of random-access memory (primary storage or volatile memory) that a computer&#x27;s software is treating as if the memory were a disk drive (secondary storage). RAM drives provide high-performance temporary storage for demanding tasks and protect non-volatile storage devices from wearing down, since RAM is not prone to wear from writing, unlike non-volatile flash memory.

It is sometimes referred to as a virtual RAM drive or software RAM drive to distinguish it from a hardware RAM drive that uses separate hardware containing RAM, which is a type of battery-backed solid-state drive.

Historically primary storage based mass storage devices were conceived to bridge the performance gap between internal memory and secondary storage devices. In the advent of solid-state devices this advantage lost most of its appeal. However, solid-state devices do suffer from wear from frequent writing. Primary memory writes do not so or in far lesser effect. So RAM devices do offer an advantage to store frequently changing data, like temporary or cached information.

== Performance ==
The performance of a RAM drive is generally orders of magnitude faster than other forms of digital storage, such as SSD, tape, optical, hard disk, and floppy drives. This performance gain is due to multiple factors, including access time, maximum throughput, and file system characteristics.

File access time is greatly reduced since a RAM drive is solid state (no moving parts). A physical hard drive, optical (e.g, CD-ROM, DVD, and Blu-ray) or other media (e.g. magnetic bubble, acoustic storage, magnetic tape) must move the information to a particular position before reading or writing can occur. RAM drives can access data with only the address, eliminating this latency.

Second, the maximum throughput of a RAM drive is limited by the speed of the RAM, the data bus, and the CPU of the computer. Other forms of storage media are further limited by the speed of the storage bus, such as IDE (PATA), SATA, USB or FireWire. Compounding this limitation is the speed of the actual mechanics of the drive motors, heads, or eyes.

Third, the file system in use, such as NTFS, HFS, UFS, ext2, etc., uses extra accesses, reads and writes to the drive, which although small, can add up quickly, especially in the event of many small files vs. few larger files (temporary internet folders, web caches, etc.).

Because the storage is in RAM, it is volatile memory, which means it will be lost in the event of power loss, whether intentional (computer reboot or shutdown) or accidental (power failure or system crash). This is, in general, a weakness (the data must periodically be backed up to a persistent-storage medium to avoid loss), but is sometimes desirable: for example, when working with a decrypted copy of an encrypted file, or using the RAM drive to store the system&#x27;s temporary files.

In many cases, the data stored on the RAM drive is created from data permanently stored elsewhere, for faster access, and is re-created on the RAM drive when the system reboots.

Apart from the risk of data loss, the major limitation of RAM drives is capacity, which is constrained by the amount of installed RAM. Multi-terabyte SSD storage has become common, but RAM is still measured in gigabytes.

RAM drives use normal system memory as if it were a partition on a physical hard drive rather than accessing the data bus normally used for secondary storage. Though RAM drives can often be supported directly in the operating system via special mechanisms in the OS kernel, it is generally simpler to access a RAM drive through a virtual device driver. This makes the non-disk nature of RAM drives invisible to both the OS and applications.

Usually no battery backup is needed due to the temporary nature of the information stored in the RAM drive, but an uninterruptible power supply can keep the system running during a short power outage.

Some RAM drives use a compressed file system such as cramfs to allow compressed data to be accessed on the fly, without decompressing it first. This is convenient because RAM drives are often small due to the higher price per byte than conventional hard drive storage.

==History and operating system specifics==

The first software RAM drive for microcomputers was invented and written by Jerry Karlin in the UK in 1979/80. The software, known as the Silicon Disk System, was further developed into a commercial product and marketed by JK Systems Research which became Microcosm Research Ltd when the company was joined by Peter Cheesewright of Microcosm Ltd. The idea was to enable the early microcomputers to use more RAM than the CPU could directly address. Making bank-switched RAM behave like a disk drive was much faster than the disk drives. especially before hard drives were readily available on such machines. The Silicon Disk was launched in 1980, initially for the CP/M operating system and later for MS-DOS.

The 128kB Atari 130XE (with DOS 2.5) and Commodore 128 natively support RAM drives, as does ProDOS for the Apple II. On systems with 128kB or more of RAM, ProDOS automatically creates a RAM drive named .

IBM added a RAM drive named VDISK.SYS to PC DOS (version 3.0) in August 1984, which was the first DOS component to use extended memory. VDISK.SYS was not available in Microsoft&#x27;s MS-DOS as it, unlike most components of early versions of PC DOS, was written by IBM. Microsoft included the similar program RAMDRIVE.SYS in MS-DOS 3.2 (released in 1986), which could also use expanded memory. It was discontinued in Windows 7. DR-DOS and the DR family of multi-user operating systems also came with a RAM disk named VDISK.SYS. In Multiuser DOS, the RAM disk defaults to the drive letter M: (for memory drive). AmigaOS has had a built in RAM drive since the release of version 1.1 in 1985 and still has it in AmigaOS 4.1 (2010). Apple Computer added the functionality to the Apple Macintosh with System 7&#x27;s Memory control panel in 1991, and kept the feature through the life of Mac OS 9. Mac OS X users can use the hdid, newfs (or newfs hfs) and mount utilities to create, format and mount a RAM drive.

A RAM drive innovation introduced in 1986 but made generally available in 1987 by Perry Kivolowitz for AmigaOS was the ability of the RAM drive to survive most crashes and reboots. Called the ASDG Recoverable Ram Disk, the device survived reboots by allocating memory dynamically in the reverse order of default memory allocation (a feature supported by the underlying OS) so as to reduce memory fragmentation. A &quot;super-block&quot; was written with a unique signature which could be located in memory upon reboot. The super-block, and all other RRD disk &quot;blocks&quot; maintained check sums to enable the invalidation of the disk if corruption was detected. At first, the ASDG RRD was locked to ASDG memory boards and used as a selling feature. Later, the ASDG RRD was made available as shareware carrying a suggested donation of 10 dollars. The shareware version appeared on Fred Fish Disks 58 and 241. AmigaOS itself would gain a Recoverable Ram Disk (called &quot;RAD&quot;) in version 1.3.

Many Unix and Unix-like systems provide some form of RAM drive functionality, such as on Linux, or md(4) on FreeBSD. RAM drives are particularly useful in high-performance, low-resource applications for which Unix-like operating systems are sometimes configured. There are also a few specialized &quot;ultra-lightweight&quot; Linux distributions which are designed to boot from removable media and stored in a ramdisk for the entire session.

===Dedicated hardware RAM drives===
There have been RAM drives which use DRAM memory that is exclusively dedicated to function as an extremely low latency storage device. This memory is isolated from the processor and not directly accessible in the same manner as normal system memory. Some of the first dedicated RAM drives were released in 1983-1985.

An early example of a hardware RAM drive was introduced by Assimilation Process in 1986 for the Macintosh. Called the &quot;Excalibur&quot;, it was an external 2MB RAM drive, and retailed for between $599 and $699 US. With the RAM capacity expandable in 1MB increments, its internal battery was said to be effective for between 6 and 8 hours, and, unusual for the time, it was connected via the Macintosh floppy disk port.

In 2002, Cenatek produced the &quot;Rocket Drive&quot;, max 4 GB, which had four DIMM slots for PC133 memory, with up to a maximum of four gigabytes of storage. At the time, common desktop computers used 64 to 128 megabytes of PC100 or PC133 memory. The one gigabyte PC133 modules (the largest available at the time) cost approximately $1,300 (). A fully outfitted Rocket Drive with four GB of storage would have cost $5,600 ().

In 2005, Gigabyte Technology produced the i-RAM, max 4 GB, which functioned essentially identically to the Rocket Drive, except upgraded to use the newer DDR memory technology, though also limited to a maximum of 4 GB capacity.

For both of these devices, the dynamic RAM requires continuous power to retain data; when power is lost, the data fades away. For the Rocket Drive, there was a connector for an external power supply separate from the computer, and the option for an external battery to retain data during a power failure. The i-RAM included a small battery directly on the expansion board, for 10-16 hours of protection.

Both devices used the SATA 1.0 interface to transfer data from the dedicated RAM drive to the system. The SATA interface was a slow bottleneck that limited the maximum performance of both RAM drives, but these drives still provided exceptionally low data access latency and high sustained transfer speeds, compared to mechanical hard drives.

In 2006, Gigabyte Technology produced the GC-RAMDISK, max 8GB, which was the second generation creation for the i-RAM. It has a maximum of 8 GB capacity, twice that of the i-RAM. It used the SATA-II port, again twice that of the i-RAM. One of its best selling points is that it can be used as a boot device.

In 2007, ACard Technology produced the ANS-9010 Serial ATA RAM disk, max 64 GB. Quote from the tech report: The ANS-9010 &quot;which has eight DDR2 DIMM slots and support for up to 8 GB of memory per slot. The ANS-9010 also features a pair of Serial ATA ports, allowing it to function as a single drive or masquerade as a pair of drives that can easily be split into an even faster RAID 0 array.&quot;

In 2009, Acard Technology produced the ACARD ANS-9010BA 5.25&quot; Dynamic SSD SATA-II RAM Disk, max 64GB. It uses a single SATA-II port.

Both variants are equipped with one or more CompactFlash card interface located in the front panel, allowing non-volatile data being stored on the RAM drive to be copied on the CompactFlash card in case of power failure and low backup battery. Two pushbuttons located on the front panel allows the user to manually backup / restore data on the RAM drive. The CompactFlash card itself is not accessible to the user by normal means as the CF card is solely intended for RAM backup and restoration. The CF card&#x27;s capacity has to meet / exceed the RAM module&#x27;s total capacity in order to effectively work as a reliable backup.

In 2009, DDRdrive, LLC produced the DDRDrive X1, which claims to be the fastest solid state drive in the world. The drive is a primary 4GB DDR dedicated RAM drive for regular use, which can back up to and recall from a 4GB SLC NAND drive. The intended market is for keeping and recording log files. If there is a power loss the data can be saved to an internal 4GB ssd in 60 seconds, via the use of a battery backup. Thereafter the data can be recovered back in to RAM once power is restored. A host power loss triggers the DDRdrive X1 to back up volatile data to on-board non-volatile storage.

<text>Jeet Kune Do (; abbreviated JKD) is a hybrid martial art conceived and practiced by martial artist Bruce Lee. It was formed from Lee&#x27;s experiences in unarmed fighting and self-defence—as well as eclectic, Zen Buddhist, Confucianist and Taoist philosophies—as a new school of martial arts thought.

At the heart of Jeet Kune Do lies the principle of intercepting the opponent&#x27;s attacks, crafting responses or counterattacks that effectively target the adversary&#x27;s offensive moves. JKD also incorporates a set of principles to help practitioners make instant decisions and improve the physical and mental self, being intended to have practical applications in life without the traditional routines and metaphysics of conventional martial arts. As an eclectic martial art, it relies on a fighting style heavily influenced by Wing Chun, Tai Chi, taekwondo, boxing, fencing and jujutsu.

Bruce Lee himself never formalized Jeet Kune Do before he died. This forced later JKD practitioners to rely upon their own interpretation of the philosophy created by Bruce Lee.

As a hybrid martial arts philosophy drawing from different combat disciplines, Jeet Kune Do is often credited with paving the way for Mixed martial arts (MMA).

==Overview and philosophy==

Growing up in Hong Kong, Lee was a student of Wing Chun Grandmaster Ip Man. However, in America he called what he taught Jun Fan Gung Fu However, around 1964, following his encounter with Wong Jack-man, Lee disavowed the rigidity of systematized martial arts. Following this, Lee began a journey of research in order to refine his way of practicing martial arts. In 1965, he outlined the basic concepts of Jeet Kune Do in a press interview, but it was not until 1967 that he came up with the name Jeet Kune Do. Initially, Lee wrestled with putting a name to his art as he constantly veered away from any type of crystallization of its essence; however, the simple need to refer to it in some concrete way led him to decide upon a name for it.


The metaphor Lee borrowed from Chan Buddhism was of constantly filling a cup with water, and then emptying it, used for describing Lee&#x27;s philosophy of &quot;casting off what is useless&quot;. Lee considered traditional form-based martial arts, which practiced pre-arranged patterns, forms and techniques, to be restrictive and ineffective in dealing with chaotic self-defence situations. Lee believed that real combat was alive and dynamic and conceived Jeet Kune Do to enable its practitioners to adapt to the changes of live combat, believing that it was only through its use in real combat that a martial arts practitioner could judge a technique worthy of adoption.

==Principles==
Lee incorporated into Jeet Kune Do four universal combat truths that he felt were self-evident and would lead to combat success if followed. The &quot;4 Combat Ranges&quot; in particular are what he felt were instrumental in becoming a &quot;total&quot; martial artist. This is also the principle most related to mixed martial arts.

JKD practitioners also subscribe to the notion that the best defence is a strong offense, hence the principle of &quot;Intercepting&quot;. Lee believed that in order for an opponent to attack someone they had to move towards them. This provided an opportunity to &quot;intercept&quot; that attack or movement. The principle of interception covers more than just intercepting physical attacks. Lee believed that many non-verbals and telegraphs (subtle movements that an opponent is unaware of) could be perceived or &quot;intercepted&quot; and thus be used to one&#x27;s advantage. The &quot;5 Ways of Attack&quot; are attacking categories that help Jeet Kune Do practitioners organize their fighting repertoire and comprise the offensive portion of JKD. The concepts of Stop hits &amp; stop kicks and simultaneous parrying &amp; punching were borrowed from European fencing and Wing Chun&#x27;s theory of simultaneous defending and attacking and comprise the defensive portion of JKD. These concepts were modified for unarmed combat and implemented into the JKD framework by Lee. These concepts also complement the other principle of interception.

===Be like water===
Lee believed that martial systems should be as flexible as possible. He often used water as an analogy for describing why flexibility is a desired trait in martial arts. Water is infinitely flexible. It can be seen through, and yet at other times it can obscure things from sight. It can split and go around things, rejoining on the other side, or it can crash through things. It can erode the hardest rocks by gently lapping away at them or it can flow past the tiniest pebble. Lee believed that a martial system should have these attributes. JKD students reject traditional systems of training, fighting styles and the Confucian pedagogy used in traditional kung fu schools because of this lack of flexibility. JKD is claimed to be a dynamic concept that is forever changing, thus being extremely flexible. &quot;Absorb what is useful; disregard that which is useless&quot; is an often quoted Bruce Lee . A JKD student is encouraged to study every form of combat possible, both to add to his arsenal and to know how to defend against such tactics.

===Economy of motion===
JKD students are told to waste no time or movement. This technique can be called the technique of &quot;Least action&quot; thus strike the opponent with the least distance, time and energy possible but also giving a powerful and precise strike. When it comes to combat JKD practitioners believe the simplest things work best.

====Stop hits and stop kicks====

Adherents of JKD area taught to intercept an opponent&#x27;s attack with an attack of their own, rather than simply blocking the attack. JKD practitioners consider this to be the most difficult defensive skill to develop. This strategy is a feature of some traditional Chinese martial arts, as well as an essential component of European épée fencing (known in fencing terminology as the &quot;counter-attack&quot;).

====Simultaneous parrying and punching====

When confronting an incoming attack, the attack is parried or deflected and a counterattack is delivered at the same time. This is not as advanced as a stop hit but is more effective than blocking and then counterattacking in sequence. This is also practiced by some Chinese martial arts.

====No high kicks====
JKD practitioners believe they should target their kicks to their opponent&#x27;s shins, knees, thighs, midsection, and no higher, as these targets are the closest to the (kicking) foot, provide more stability, and are more difficult to defend against. However, as with all other JKD principles, nothing is written in stone, and if a target of opportunity above the midsection presents itself, one may take advantage of it without feeling hampered by this principle.

===The four ranges of combat===
* Kicking
* Punching
* Trapping
* Grappling

Jeet Kune Do students train in each of these ranges equally. According to Lee, this range of training serves to differentiate JKD from other martial arts. Lee stated that most but not all traditional martial systems specialize in training at one or two ranges. Bruce Lee&#x27;s theories have been especially influential and substantiated in the field of Mixed Martial Arts, as the MMA Phases of Combat are essentially the same concept as the JKD combat ranges. As a historical note, the ranges in JKD have evolved over time. Initially the ranges were categorized as short or close, medium, and long range. These terms proved ambiguous and eventually evolved into their more descriptive forms although there may still be others who prefer the three categories.

===Five ways of attack===
* &quot;Single Angular Attack&quot; (SAA) and its converse &quot;Single Direct Attack&quot; (SDA).
* &quot;Hand Immobilization Attack&quot; (HIA) and its counterpart &quot;Foot Immobilization attack&quot;, which make use of trapping to limit the opponent&#x27;s function with that appendage.
* &quot;Progressive Indirect Attack&quot; (PIA). Attacking one part of the opponent&#x27;s body followed by attacking another part as a means of creating an opening.
* &quot;Attack By Combinations&quot; (ABC). This is using multiple rapid attacks, with volume of attack as a means of overcoming the opponent.
* &quot;Attack By Drawing&quot; (ABD). This is creating an opening with positioning as a means of counterattacking.

===Three parts of JKD===
JKD practitioners believe that techniques should contain the following properties:
* &quot;Efficiency&quot; - An attack that reaches its mark
* &quot;Directness&quot; - Doing what comes naturally in a learned way.
* &quot;Simplicity&quot; - Thinking in an uncomplicated manner; without ornamentation.

===Centreline===
The centreline refers to an imaginary line running down the centre of one&#x27;s body. The theory is to exploit, control and dominate your opponent&#x27;s centreline. All attacks, defences and footwork are designed to preserve your own centreline and open your opponent&#x27;s. Lee incorporated this theory into JKD from Wing Chun. This notion is closely related to maintaining control of the centre squares in the strategic game chess.

The three guidelines for centreline are:
* The one who controls the centreline will control the fight.
* Protect and maintain your own centreline while you control and exploit your opponent&#x27;s.
* Control the centreline by occupying it.

==Branches==
Although Bruce Lee officially closed his martial arts schools two years before his death, he allowed his curriculum to be taught privately. Since his death, Jeet Kune Do is argued to have split into different groups. They are:

* The &quot;Original (or Jun Fan) JKD&quot; branch, whose proponents include Taky Kimura, James Lee, Jerry Poteet, and Ted Wong; these groups claim to teach what was believed to be only what was taught by Bruce Lee and encourage the student to further develop his or her abilities through those teachings. The inherent training principles of this branch are shaped by the static concept of what was &quot;originally taught&quot;, just as the training systems of &quot;traditional&quot; martial arts have been taught for centuries and become recognizable as &quot;styles&quot;, except it is referred to as a philosophy of &quot;style without style&quot;.

* The &quot;JKD Concepts&quot; branch, whose proponents include Dan Inosanto, Richard Bustillo, and Larry Hartsell; these groups strive to continue the philosophy of individual self-expression through re-interpretation of combat systems through the lens of Jeet Kune Do, under the concept that it was never meant to be a static art but rather an ongoing evolution, and have incorporated elements from many other martial arts into the main fold of its teachings (most notably, grappling and Kali / Escrima material) based on the individual&#x27;s personal preferences and physical attributes. The entire JKD &quot;system&quot; can be described through a simple diagram, and the concepts can then be applied to a variety of contexts in a &quot;universal&quot; way.

To understand the branches of JKD it is important to understand the difference between the two &quot;types&quot; or viewpoints of Jeet Kune Do:

#JKD framework: This type of JKD provides the guiding principles. Bruce Lee experimented with many styles and techniques to reach these conclusions. To Lee these principles were truisms. The JKD framework is not bound or confined by any styles or systems. This type of JKD is a process.
#JKD Personal Systems: This type of JKD utilizes the JKD framework along with any techniques from any other style or system to construct a &quot;personal system&quot;. This approach utilizes a &quot;building blocks&quot; manner in which to construct a personalized system that is especially tailored to an individual. Lee believed that only an individual could determine for themselves what the usefulness of any technique should be. This type of JKD is thus a product.
Lee believed that this freedom of adoption was a distinguishing property from traditional martial arts.

There are many who confuse the JKD Framework with a JKD Personal System (e.g., Bruce Lee&#x27;s personal JKD) thinking them to be one and the same. The system that Bruce Lee personally expressed was his own personal JKD; tailored for himself. Before he could do this, however, he needed to first develop the &quot;JKD Framework&quot; process. Many of the systems that Bruce Lee studied were not to develop his &quot;Personal JKD&quot; but rather was used to gather the &quot;principles&quot; for incorporation in the JKD Framework approach. The uniqueness of JKD to Lee is that it was a &quot;process&quot; not a &quot;product&quot; and thus not a &quot;style&quot; but a system, concept, or approach. Traditional martial arts styles are essentially a product that is given to a student with little provision for change. These traditional styles are usually fixed and not tailored for individuals. Bruce Lee claimed there were inherent problems with this approach and established a &quot;Process&quot; based system rather than a fixed style which a student could then utilize to make a &quot;tailored&quot; or &quot;Personal&quot; product of their own.

The two branches of JKD differ in what should be incorporated or offered within the &quot;JKD Framework&quot;. The Original (or Jun Fan) JKD branch believes that the original principles before Bruce Lee died are all that is needed for the construction of personalized systems.
JKD Concepts branch believe that there are further principles that can be added to construct personalized systems. The value of each Branch can be determined by individual practitioners based on whatever merits they deem important.

Original JKD is further divided into two points of view - OJKD and JFJKD both hold Wing Chun, Western boxing and fencing as the cornerstones on Bruce&#x27;s JKD.
*OJKD follows all Bruce&#x27;s training from early Jun Fan Gung Fu (Seattle period) and focuses on trapping with Wing Chun influence.
*Jun Fan Jeet Kune Do is a signature version of JKD as Bruce taught privately to Ted Wong. This is a later time period and practices a greater emphasis on elusiveness and simplified trapping unique to Bruce&#x27;s later approach to combat. The focus is with fencing and Western boxing.

==Conditioning==
Some of the exercises Lee did included &quot;Da Sam Sing&quot; or &quot;Gak Sam Sing, a&quot; traditional method of forearm conditioning practiced in classical Kung Fu. He also did exercises simulating a fight against a four-limbed human using the traditional &quot;Mook Yan Jong&quot; used in Wing Chun. Lee was also an avid follower of Indian wrestler Great Gama&#x27;s training routine. He read articles about him and how he employed his exercises to build his strength for wrestling, incorporating them into his own routine. The training routines Lee used included isometrics as well as &quot;the cat stretch&quot;, &quot;the squat&quot; (known as &quot;baithak&quot;), and also known as the &quot;deep-knee bend.&quot;

==Influence and references in popular culture==
Kato from &quot;Green Hornet&quot; is the first fictional character to use Jeet Kune Do, as he was portrayed by Bruce Lee in the 1966 TV series. In the aforementioned TV series, Lee would demonstrate various techniques associated with Jeet Kune Do. Following Lee&#x27;s impact and death, Kato would utilize JKD in subsequent incarnations of Green Hornet media.

In Arrow, Jeet Kune Do is the martial arts style of the League of Assassins.

===Fighting games===
Various video game characters utilize Jeet Kune Do as their choice way of fighting. These include:
* Liu Kang, Johnny Cage and Mokap in &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;
* K&#x27; in the &quot;King of Fighters&quot; uses a style notably similar to Jeet Kune Do, although his fighting style is listed in official profiles as &quot;pure violence.&quot;
* Jacky Bryant and Sarah Bryant from &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot;
* Marshall Law, Forest Law, and Lee Chaolan from &quot;Tekken&quot;
* Midknight from &quot;Eternal Champions&quot;
* Jann Lee from &quot;Dead or Alive&quot;
* Fei Long from &quot;Super Street Fighter II&quot;
* Jon Talbain from &quot;Darkstalkers&quot;
* Chou from &quot;Mobile Legends: Bang Bang&quot;
* Clair Andrews from &quot;Ehrgeiz&quot;
* Iron Fist from &quot;Marvel Rivals&quot;

<text>Dragon is one of the two official magazines for source material for the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; role-playing game and associated products, along with &quot;Dungeon&quot;.

TSR, Inc. originally launched the monthly printed magazine in 1976 to succeed the company&#x27;s earlier publication, &quot;The Strategic Review&quot;. The final printed issue was #359 in September 2007. Shortly after the last print issue shipped in mid-August 2007, Wizards of the Coast (part of Hasbro, Inc.), the publication&#x27;s current copyright holder, relaunched &quot;Dragon&quot; as an online magazine, continuing on the numbering of the print edition. The last published issue was No. 430 in December 2013. A digital publication called &quot;Dragon+&quot;, which replaced &quot;Dragon&quot; magazine, was launched in 2015. It was created by the advertising agency Dialect in collaboration with Wizards of the Coast, and its numbering system for issues started at No. 1.

==History==

===TSR===
In 1975, TSR, Inc. began publishing &quot;The Strategic Review&quot;. At the time, roleplaying games were still seen as a subgenre of the wargaming industry, and the magazine was designed not only to support &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; and TSR&#x27;s other games, but also to cover wargaming in general. In short order, however, the popularity and growth of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; made it clear that the game had not only separated itself from its wargaming origins, but had launched an entirely new industry unto itself.

TSR canceled &quot;The Strategic Review&quot; the following year after only seven issues, and replaced it with two magazines, &quot;Little Wars&quot;, which covered miniature wargaming, and &quot;The Dragon&quot;, which covered role playing games. After twelve issues, &quot;Little Wars&quot; ceased independent publication and issue 13 was published as part of &quot;Dragon&quot; issue 22.

The magazine debuted as &quot;The Dragon&quot; in June 1976. TSR co-founder Gary Gygax commented years later: &quot;When I decided that &quot;The Strategic Review&quot; was not the right vehicle, hired Tim Kask as a magazine editor for Tactical Studies Rules, and named the new publication he was to produce &quot;The Dragon&quot;, I thought we would eventually have a great periodical to serve gaming enthusiasts worldwide... At no time did I ever contemplate so great a success or so long a lifespan.&quot;

&quot;Dragon&quot; is the launching point for a number of rules, spells, monsters, magic items, and other ideas that were incorporated into later official products of the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; game. A prime example is the Forgotten Realms campaign setting, which first became known through a series of &quot;Dragon&quot; articles in the 1980s by its creator Ed Greenwood. It subsequently went on to become one of the primary campaign &quot;worlds&quot; for official &quot;Dungeons and Dragons&quot; products, starting in 1987. The magazine appeared on the cover as simply &quot;Dragon&quot; from July 1980, later changing its name to &quot;Dragon Magazine&quot; starting November 1987.

===Wizards of the Coast===
Wizards of the Coast purchased TSR and its intellectual properties, including &quot;Dragon Magazine&quot;, in 1997. Production was then transferred from Wisconsin to Washington state. In 1999, Wizards of the Coast was itself purchased by Hasbro, Inc. &quot;Dragon Magazine&quot; suffered a five-month gap between #236 and #237 but remained published by TSR as a subsidiary of WotC starting September 1997, and until January 2000 when WotC became the listed de facto publisher. They removed the word &quot;magazine&quot; from the cover title starting with the June 2000 issue, changing the publication&#x27;s name back to simply &quot;Dragon&quot;.

In 1999 a CD-ROM compilation of the first 250 issues, called &quot;Dragon Magazine Archive&quot;, was released in PDF format with a special viewer. It includes the seven issues of &quot;The Strategic Review&quot;. The &quot;Dragon Magazine Archive&quot; is out of print because of issues raised with the 2001 ruling in &quot;Greenberg v. National Geographic&quot; regarding the reprint rights of various comic strips that had been printed in &quot;Dragon&quot; over the years and Paizo Publishing&#x27;s policy that creators of comics retain their copyright. These comic strips include &quot;Wormy&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s New with Phil &amp; Dixie&quot;, &quot;Snarf Quest&quot;, and &quot;Knights of the Dinner Table&quot; which is covered in TSR&#x27;s own statement in the first issue that &quot;All material published herein becomes the exclusive property of the publisher unless special arrangements to the contrary are made.&quot;

===Paizo===
In 2002, Paizo Publishing acquired the rights to publish both &quot;Dragon&quot; and &quot;Dungeon&quot; under license from Wizards of the Coast. &quot;Dragon&quot; was published by Paizo starting September 2002. It ties &quot;Dragon&quot; more closely to &quot;Dungeon&quot; by including articles supporting and promoting its major multi-issue adventures such as the &quot;Age of Worms&quot; and &quot;Savage Tide&quot;. &quot;Class Acts&quot;, a monthly publication with one- or two-page articles offering ideas for developing specific character classes, were also introduced by Paizo.

===Return to Wizards of the Coast===
On April 18, 2007, Wizards of the Coast announced that it would not be renewing Paizo&#x27;s licenses for &quot;Dragon&quot; and &quot;Dungeon,&quot; instead opting for online publishing. Paizo published the last print editions of &quot;Dragon&quot; and &quot;Dungeon&quot; magazines for September 2007.

In August 2007, Wizards of the Coast announced the fourth edition of the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; game and that &quot;D&amp;D Insider&quot; subscriber content would include the new, online versions of both &quot;Dungeon&quot; and &quot;Dragon&quot; magazines along with tools for building campaigns, managing character sheets, and other features. In its online form, &quot;Dragon&quot; continues to publish articles aimed at &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; players, with rules data from these articles feeding the D&amp;D Character Builder and other online tools.

====Cessation====
In the September 2013 issue of &quot;Dragon&quot; (#427) an article by Wizards of the Coast game designer and editor Chris Perkins announced that both &quot;Dragon&quot; and its sibling publication &quot;Dungeon&quot; would be going on hiatus starting January 2014 pending the release of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 5th edition. The final online version released is Issue #430 in December 2013.

====Dragon+====
A new and fully digital bi-monthly publication called &quot;Dragon+&quot;, was launched on April 30, 2015, succeeding the existing versions of &quot;Dragon&quot; and &quot;Dungeon&quot; magazines. Created by Dialect in collaboration with Wizards of the Coast, the online edition ceased continuity with the printed and digital versions of both magazines, and restarted its numbering system for issues at No. 1.

The magazine branded itself as an app with content &quot;showcasing what’s new in Dungeons &amp; Dragons – from backstory and world information to discussions about what&#x27;s coming next from the creators and developers of your favorite D&amp;D products&quot;. Articles included cover content such as: game strategies and insights; details of the current D&amp;D storyline; interviews; ongoing comic series; lore; Forgotten Realms world information; community updates and fan submissions; and videos. Additional content in the magazine is also accessible through links to the magazine&#x27;s content in Facebook and Twitter feeds.

&quot;Dragon+&quot; ran for 41 issues in total with the last issue published in April 2022; Wizards of the Coast published an update in July 2022 announcing the cancellation of the publication. On November 15, 2022, Wizards of the Coast announced that &quot;&quot;Dragon+&quot; will be removed from app stores on or around November 15th, and dragonmag.com will be redirected and its content will no longer be available&quot;.

==Content==
Many of the gaming world&#x27;s most famous writers, game designers and artists have published work in the magazine. Through most of its run the magazine frequently published fantasy fiction, either short stories or novel excerpts. After the 1990s, the appearance of fiction stories became relatively rare. One late example was issue #305&#x27;s featured excerpt from George R.R. Martin&#x27;s later Hugo-nominated novel &quot;A Feast for Crows&quot;. It also featured book reviews of fantasy and science fiction novels, and occasionally of films of particular interest (such as the TV movie of &quot;Mazes and Monsters&quot;).

From the magazine&#x27;s beginning until issue 274, from August 2000, &quot;Dragon&quot; published articles for various versions of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; and, at various times, other gaming systems. With issue 274, &quot;Dragon&quot; published exclusively 3rd Edition &quot;D&amp;D&quot; content, or content for other games published by Wizards Of The Coast&#x27;s d20 System games. With the release of the 3.5 Edition update in July 2003, issue 309 onward published only Edition 3.5 content and carried a &quot;100% Official &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;&quot; masthead. The magazine switched to exclusively 4th Edition &quot;D&amp;D&quot; content from issue 364 on the release of 4th Edition in June 2008.

===Articles===
Most of the magazine&#x27;s articles provide supplementary material for &quot;D&amp;D&quot; including new prestige classes, races, and monsters. A long-running column &quot;Sage Advice&quot; offers official answers to &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; questions submitted by players. Other articles provide tips and suggestions for players and Dungeon Masters (DMs). It sometimes discusses meta-gaming issues, such as getting along with fellow players. At the end of its print run, the magazine also features four comics; &quot;Nodwick&quot;, &quot;Dork Tower&quot;, &quot;Zogonia&quot;, and a specialized version of the webcomic &quot;The Order of the Stick&quot;. Previous gamer-oriented comic strips include &quot;Knights of the Dinner Table&quot;, &quot;Finieous Fingers&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s New with Phil &amp; Dixie&quot;, &quot;Wormy&quot;, &quot;Yamara&quot;, and &quot;SnarfQuest&quot;.

&quot;Dragon&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Ecology of ...&quot; articles were initially written in the voice of the fictional sage Elminster, who reviewed a D&amp;D monster in-depth. Under Paizo&#x27;s tenure such ecology articles became heavier in game mechanics than narrative and description. The &quot;Dragon&quot; submissions guidelines explicitly state that Ecology articles &quot;should have a hunter’s guidebook approach, although it should not be written &#x27;in voice&#x27;&quot; and further specify the exact format of Ecology articles, leaving less room for artistic license by the author.

In the early 1980s, almost every issue contains a role playing adventure, a simple board game, or some kind of special game supplement (such as a cardboard cut-out castle). For instance, Tom Wham&#x27;s &quot;Snit&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, &quot;The Awful Green Things from Outer Space&quot; and &quot;File 13&quot; all started as supplements within &quot;The Dragon&quot;. These bonus features are infrequent after the 1986 launch of &quot;Dungeon&quot; magazine, which published several new &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; adventures in each issue.

During the 1980s, after TSR had purchased Simulations Publications Inc., the magazine had a subsection called &quot;Ares Magazine&quot;, based on SPI&#x27;s magazine of that name, specializing in science fiction and superhero role playing games, with pages marked by a gray border. The content included write-ups for various characters of the Marvel Universe for TSR&#x27;s &quot;Marvel Super-Heroes&quot;.

===Special issues===

As noted above &quot;The Dragon&quot; was preceded by seven issues of &quot;The Strategic Review&quot;. In the magazine&#x27;s early years it also published five &quot;Best of&quot; issues, reprinting highly regarded articles from &quot;The Strategic Review&quot; and &quot;The Dragon&quot;. From 1996 to 2001, &quot;Dragon Magazine&quot; published the &quot;Dragon Annual&quot;, a thirteenth issue of all new content.

== Other releases ==

A collection of &quot;Dragon&quot; was released as the &quot;Dragon Magazine Archive&quot; in 1999. It was released as a CD-ROM with a Windows application and PDF files. The &quot;Dragon Magazine Archive&quot; was directed by Rob Voce, and published by TSR/Wizards of the Coast. &quot;Pyramid&quot; reviewed it, saying that the archive was &quot;worth the price&quot;, but that its application&#x27;s Windows-only format limits other platforms from being able to read the PDFs manually. It was reviewed in &quot;Backstab&quot; #19.

<text>Single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) is a type of parallel processing in Flynn&#x27;s taxonomy. SIMD can be internal (part of the hardware design) and it can be directly accessible through an instruction set architecture (ISA), but it should not be confused with an ISA. SIMD describes computers with multiple processing elements that perform the same operation on multiple data points simultaneously.

Such machines exploit data level parallelism, but not concurrency: there are simultaneous (parallel) computations, but each unit performs exactly the same instruction at any given moment (just with different data). SIMD is particularly applicable to common tasks such as adjusting the contrast in a digital image or adjusting the volume of digital audio. Most modern CPU designs include SIMD instructions to improve the performance of multimedia use. SIMD has three different subcategories in Flynn&#x27;s 1972 Taxonomy, one of which is SIMT. SIMT should not be confused with software threads or hardware threads, both of which are task time-sharing (time-slicing). SIMT is true simultaneous parallel hardware-level execution.

Each hardware element (PU) working on individual data item sometimes also referred as SIMD lane or channel. Modern graphics processing units (GPUs) are often wide SIMD (typically &gt;16 data lanes or channel) implementations.

==History==
The first use of SIMD instructions was in the ILLIAC IV, which was completed in 1966.

SIMD was the basis for vector supercomputers of the early 1970s such as the CDC Star-100 and the Texas Instruments ASC, which could operate on a &quot;vector&quot; of data with a single instruction. Vector processing was especially popularized by Cray in the 1970s and 1980s. Vector processing architectures are now considered separate from SIMD computers: Duncan&#x27;s Taxonomy includes them whereas Flynn&#x27;s Taxonomy does not, due to Flynn&#x27;s work (1966, 1972) pre-dating the Cray-1 (1977).

The first era of modern SIMD computers was characterized by massively parallel processing-style supercomputers such as the Thinking Machines CM-1 and CM-2. These computers had many limited-functionality processors that would work in parallel. For example, each of 65,536 single-bit processors in a Thinking Machines CM-2 would execute the same instruction at the same time, allowing, for instance, to logically combine 65,536 pairs of bits at a time, using a hypercube-connected network or processor-dedicated RAM to find its operands. Supercomputing moved away from the SIMD approach when inexpensive scalar MIMD approaches based on commodity processors such as the Intel i860 XP became more powerful, and interest in SIMD waned.

The current era of SIMD processors grew out of the desktop-computer market rather than the supercomputer market. As desktop processors became powerful enough to support real-time gaming and audio/video processing during the 1990s, demand grew for this particular type of computing power, and microprocessor vendors turned to SIMD to meet the demand. Hewlett-Packard introduced MAX instructions into PA-RISC 1.1 desktops in 1994 to accelerate MPEG decoding. Sun Microsystems introduced SIMD integer instructions in its &quot;VIS&quot; instruction set extensions in 1995, in its UltraSPARC I microprocessor. MIPS followed suit with their similar MDMX system.

The first widely deployed desktop SIMD was with Intel&#x27;s MMX extensions to the x86 architecture in 1996. This sparked the introduction of the much more powerful AltiVec system in the Motorola PowerPC and IBM&#x27;s POWER systems. Intel responded in 1999 by introducing the all-new SSE system. Since then, there have been several extensions to the SIMD instruction sets for both architectures. Advanced vector extensions AVX, AVX2 and AVX-512 are developed by Intel. AMD supports AVX, AVX2, and AVX-512 in their current products.

All of these developments have been oriented toward support for real-time graphics, and are therefore oriented toward processing in two, three, or four dimensions, usually with vector lengths of between two and sixteen words, depending on data type and architecture. When new SIMD architectures need to be distinguished from older ones, the newer architectures are then considered &quot;short-vector&quot; architectures, as earlier SIMD and vector supercomputers had vector lengths from 64 to 64,000. A modern supercomputer is almost always a cluster of MIMD computers, each of which implements (short-vector) SIMD instructions.

==Advantages==
An application that may take advantage of SIMD is one where the same value is being added to (or subtracted from) a large number of data points, a common operation in many multimedia applications. One example would be changing the brightness of an image. Each pixel of an image consists of three values for the brightness of the red (R), green (G) and blue (B) portions of the color. To change the brightness, the R, G and B values are read from memory, a value is added to (or subtracted from) them, and the resulting values are written back out to memory. Audio DSPs would likewise, for volume control, multiply both Left and Right channels simultaneously.

With a SIMD processor there are two improvements to this process. For one the data is understood to be in blocks, and a number of values can be loaded all at once. Instead of a series of instructions saying &quot;retrieve this pixel, now retrieve the next pixel&quot;, a SIMD processor will have a single instruction that effectively says &quot;retrieve n pixels&quot; (where n is a number that varies from design to design). For a variety of reasons, this can take much less time than retrieving each pixel individually, as with a traditional CPU design.

Another advantage is that the instruction operates on all loaded data in a single operation. In other words, if the SIMD system works by loading up eight data points at once, the codice_1 operation being applied to the data will happen to all eight values at the same time. This parallelism is separate from the parallelism provided by a superscalar processor; the eight values are processed in parallel even on a non-superscalar processor, and a superscalar processor may be able to perform multiple SIMD operations in parallel.

==Disadvantages==
* Not all algorithms can be vectorized easily. For example, a flow-control-heavy task like code parsing may not easily benefit from SIMD; however, it is theoretically possible to vectorize comparisons and &quot;batch flow&quot; to target maximal cache optimality, though this technique will require more intermediate state. Note: Batch-pipeline systems (example: GPUs or software rasterization pipelines) are most advantageous for cache control when implemented with SIMD intrinsics, but they are not exclusive to SIMD features. Further complexity may be apparent to avoid dependence within series such as code strings; while independence is required for vectorization.
* Large register files which increases power consumption and required chip area.
* Currently, implementing an algorithm with SIMD instructions usually requires human labor; most compilers do not generate SIMD instructions from a typical C program, for instance. Automatic vectorization in compilers is an active area of computer science research. (Compare vector processing.)
* Programming with particular SIMD instruction sets can involve numerous low-level challenges.
*# SIMD may have restrictions on data alignment; programmers familiar with one particular architecture may not expect this. Worse: the alignment may change from one revision or &quot;compatible&quot; processor to another.
*# Gathering data into SIMD registers and scattering it to the correct destination locations is tricky (sometimes requiring permute operations) and can be inefficient.
*# Specific instructions like rotations or three-operand addition are not available in some SIMD instruction sets.
*# Instruction sets are architecture-specific: some processors lack SIMD instructions entirely, so programmers must provide non-vectorized implementations (or different vectorized implementations) for them.
*# Different architectures provide different register sizes (e.g. 64, 128, 256 and 512 bits) and instruction sets, meaning that programmers must provide multiple implementations of vectorized code to operate optimally on any given CPU. In addition, the possible set of SIMD instructions grows with each new register size. Unfortunately, for legacy support reasons, the older versions cannot be retired.
*# The early MMX instruction set shared a register file with the floating-point stack, which caused inefficiencies when mixing floating-point and MMX code. However, SSE2 corrects this.

To remedy problems 1 and 5, RISC-V&#x27;s vector extension uses an alternative approach: instead of exposing the sub-register-level details to the programmer, the instruction set abstracts them out as a few &quot;vector registers&quot; that use the same interfaces across all CPUs with this instruction set. The hardware handles all alignment issues and &quot;strip-mining&quot; of loops. Machines with different vector sizes would be able to run the same code. LLVM calls this vector type &quot;&quot;.

An order of magnitude increase in code size is not uncommon, when compared to equivalent scalar or equivalent vector code, and an order of magnitude &quot;or greater&quot; effectiveness (work done per instruction) is achievable with Vector ISAs.

ARM&#x27;s Scalable Vector Extension takes another approach, known in Flynn&#x27;s Taxonomy as &quot;Associative Processing&quot;, more commonly known today as &quot;Predicated&quot; (masked) SIMD. This approach is not as compact as Vector processing but is still far better than non-predicated SIMD. Detailed comparative examples are given in the Vector processing page.

==Chronology==
==Hardware==
Small-scale (64 or 128 bits) SIMD became popular on general-purpose CPUs in the early 1990s and continued through 1997 and later with Motion Video Instructions (MVI) for Alpha. SIMD instructions can be found, to one degree or another, on most CPUs, including IBM&#x27;s AltiVec and SPE for PowerPC, HP&#x27;s PA-RISC Multimedia Acceleration eXtensions (MAX), Intel&#x27;s MMX and iwMMXt, SSE, SSE2, SSE3 SSSE3 and SSE4.x, AMD&#x27;s 3DNow!, ARC&#x27;s ARC Video subsystem, SPARC&#x27;s VIS and VIS2, Sun&#x27;s MAJC, ARM&#x27;s Neon technology, MIPS&#x27; MDMX (MaDMaX) and MIPS-3D. The IBM, Sony, Toshiba co-developed Cell Processor&#x27;s SPU&#x27;s instruction set is heavily SIMD based. Philips, now NXP, developed several SIMD processors named Xetal. The Xetal has 320 16-bit processor elements especially designed for vision tasks.

Intel&#x27;s AVX-512 SIMD instructions process 512 bits of data at once.

==Software==

SIMD instructions are widely used to process 3D graphics, although modern graphics cards with embedded SIMD have largely taken over this task from the CPU. Some systems also include permute functions that re-pack elements inside vectors, making them particularly useful for data processing and compression. They are also used in cryptography. The trend of general-purpose computing on GPUs (GPGPU) may lead to wider use of SIMD in the future.

Adoption of SIMD systems in personal computer software was at first slow, due to a number of problems. One was that many of the early SIMD instruction sets tended to slow overall performance of the system due to the re-use of existing floating point registers. Other systems, like MMX and 3DNow!, offered support for data types that were not interesting to a wide audience and had expensive context switching instructions to switch between using the FPU and MMX registers. Compilers also often lacked support, requiring programmers to resort to assembly language coding.

SIMD on x86 had a slow start. The introduction of 3DNow! by AMD and SSE by Intel confused matters somewhat, but today the system seems to have settled down (after AMD adopted SSE) and newer compilers should result in more SIMD-enabled software. Intel and AMD now both provide optimized math libraries that use SIMD instructions, and open source alternatives like libSIMD, SIMDx86 and SLEEF have started to appear (see also libm).

Apple Computer had somewhat more success, even though they entered the SIMD market later than the rest. AltiVec offered a rich system and can be programmed using increasingly sophisticated compilers from Motorola, IBM and GNU, therefore assembly language programming is rarely needed. Additionally, many of the systems that would benefit from SIMD were supplied by Apple itself, for example iTunes and QuickTime. However, in 2006, Apple computers moved to Intel x86 processors. Apple&#x27;s APIs and development tools (XCode) were modified to support SSE2 and SSE3 as well as AltiVec. Apple was the dominant purchaser of PowerPC chips from IBM and Freescale Semiconductor. Even though Apple has stopped using PowerPC processors in their products, further development of AltiVec is continued in several PowerPC and Power ISA designs from Freescale and IBM.

&quot;SIMD within a register&quot;, or SWAR, is a range of techniques and tricks used for performing SIMD in general-purpose registers on hardware that does not provide any direct support for SIMD instructions. This can be used to exploit parallelism in certain algorithms even on hardware that does not support SIMD directly.

===Programmer interface===
It is common for publishers of the SIMD instruction sets to make their own C/C++ language extensions with intrinsic functions or special datatypes (with operator overloading) guaranteeing the generation of vector code. Intel, AltiVec, and ARM NEON provide extensions widely adopted by the compilers targeting their CPUs. (More complex operations are the task of vector math libraries.)

The GNU C Compiler takes the extensions a step further by abstracting them into a universal interface that can be used on any platform by providing a way of defining SIMD datatypes. The LLVM Clang compiler also implements the feature, with an analogous interface defined in the IR. Rust&#x27;s crate (and the experimental ) uses this interface, and so does Swift 2.0+.

C++ has an experimental interface that works similarly to the GCC extension. LLVM&#x27;s libcxx seems to implement it. For GCC and libstdc++, a wrapper library that builds on top of the GCC extension is available.

Microsoft added SIMD to .NET in RyuJIT. The package, available on NuGet, implements SIMD datatypes. Java also has a new proposed API for SIMD instructions available in OpenJDK 17 in an incubator module. It also has a safe fallback mechanism on unsupported CPUs to simple loops.

Instead of providing an SIMD datatype, compilers can also be hinted to auto-vectorize some loops, potentially taking some assertions about the lack of data dependency. This is not as flexible as manipulating SIMD variables directly, but is easier to use. OpenMP 4.0+ has a hint. This OpenMP interface has replaced a wide set of nonstandard extensions, including Cilk&#x27;s , GCC&#x27;s , and many more.

===SIMD multi-versioning===
Consumer software is typically expected to work on a range of CPUs covering multiple generations, which could limit the programmer&#x27;s ability to use new SIMD instructions to improve the computational performance of a program. The solution is to include multiple versions of the same code that uses either older or newer SIMD technologies, and pick one that best fits the user&#x27;s CPU at run-time (dynamic dispatch). There are two main camps of solutions:
* Function multi-versioning (FMV): a subroutine in the program or a library is duplicated and compiled for many instruction set extensions, and the program decides which one to use at run-time.
* Library multi-versioning (LMV): the entire programming library is duplicated for many instruction set extensions, and the operating system or the program decides which one to load at run-time.

FMV, manually coded in assembly language, is quite commonly used in a number of performance-critical libraries such as glibc and libjpeg-turbo. Intel C++ Compiler, GNU Compiler Collection since GCC 6, and Clang since clang 7 allow for a simplified approach, with the compiler taking care of function duplication and selection. GCC and clang requires explicit labels in the code to &quot;clone&quot; functions, while ICC does so automatically (under the command-line option ). The Rust programming language also supports FMV. The setup is similar to GCC and Clang in that the code defines what instruction sets to compile for, but cloning is manually done via inlining.

As using FMV requires code modification on GCC and Clang, vendors more commonly use library multi-versioning: this is easier to achieve as only compiler switches need to be changed. Glibc supports LMV and this functionality is adopted by the Intel-backed Clear Linux project.

==SIMD on the web==
In 2013 John McCutchan announced that he had created a high-performance interface to SIMD instruction sets for the Dart programming language, bringing the benefits of SIMD to web programs for the first time. The interface consists of two types:
* Float32x4, 4 single precision floating point values.
* Int32x4, 4 32-bit integer values.

Instances of these types are immutable and in optimized code are mapped directly to SIMD registers. Operations expressed in Dart typically are compiled into a single instruction without any overhead. This is similar to C and C++ intrinsics. Benchmarks for 4×4 matrix multiplication, 3D vertex transformation, and Mandelbrot set visualization show near 400% speedup compared to scalar code written in Dart.

McCutchan&#x27;s work on Dart, now called SIMD.js, has been adopted by ECMAScript and Intel announced at IDF 2013 that they are implementing McCutchan&#x27;s specification for both V8 and SpiderMonkey. However, by 2017, SIMD.js has been taken out of the ECMAScript standard queue in favor of pursuing a similar interface in WebAssembly. As of August 2020, the WebAssembly interface remains unfinished, but its portable 128-bit SIMD feature has already seen some use in many engines.

Emscripten, Mozilla&#x27;s C/C++-to-JavaScript compiler, with extensions can enable compilation of C++ programs that make use of SIMD intrinsics or GCC-style vector code to the SIMD API of JavaScript, resulting in equivalent speedups compared to scalar code. It also supports (and now prefers) the WebAssembly 128-bit SIMD proposal.

==Commercial applications==
It has generally proven difficult to find sustainable commercial applications for SIMD-only processors.

One that has had some measure of success is the GAPP, which was developed by Lockheed Martin and taken to the commercial sector by their spin-off Teranex. The GAPP&#x27;s recent incarnations have become a powerful tool in real-time video processing applications like conversion between various video standards and frame rates (NTSC to/from PAL, NTSC to/from HDTV formats, etc.), deinterlacing, image noise reduction, adaptive video compression, and image enhancement.

A more ubiquitous application for SIMD is found in video games: nearly every modern video game console since 1998 has incorporated a SIMD processor somewhere in its architecture. The PlayStation 2 was unusual in that one of its vector-float units could function as an autonomous DSP executing its own instruction stream, or as a coprocessor driven by ordinary CPU instructions. 3D graphics applications tend to lend themselves well to SIMD processing as they rely heavily on operations with 4-dimensional vectors. Microsoft&#x27;s Direct3D 9.0 now chooses at runtime processor-specific implementations of its own math operations, including the use of SIMD-capable instructions.

A later processor that used vector processing is the Cell Processor used in the Playstation 3, which was developed by IBM in cooperation with Toshiba and Sony. It uses a number of SIMD processors (a NUMA architecture, each with independent local store and controlled by a general purpose CPU) and is geared towards the huge datasets required by 3D and video processing applications. It differs from traditional ISAs by being SIMD from the ground up with no separate scalar registers.

Ziilabs produced an SIMD type processor for use on mobile devices, such as media players and mobile phones.

Larger scale commercial SIMD processors are available from ClearSpeed Technology, Ltd. and Stream Processors, Inc. ClearSpeed&#x27;s CSX600 (2004) has 96 cores each with two double-precision floating point units while the CSX700 (2008) has 192. Stream Processors is headed by computer architect Bill Dally. Their Storm-1 processor (2007) contains 80 SIMD cores controlled by a MIPS CPU.

<doc id="55360" wikidata="Q441145" url="?curid=55360" title="AltiVec">
<text>AltiVec is a single-precision floating point and integer SIMD instruction set designed and owned by Apple, IBM, and Freescale Semiconductor (formerly Motorola&#x27;s Semiconductor Products Sector) — the AIM alliance. It is implemented on versions of the PowerPC processor architecture, including Motorola&#x27;s G4, IBM&#x27;s G5 and POWER6 processors, and P.A. Semi&#x27;s PWRficient PA6T. AltiVec is a trademark owned solely by Freescale, so the system is also referred to as Velocity Engine by Apple and VMX (Vector Multimedia Extension) by IBM and P.A. Semi.

While AltiVec refers to an instruction set, the implementations in CPUs produced by IBM and Motorola are separate in terms of logic design. To date, no IBM core has included an AltiVec logic design licensed from Motorola or vice versa.

AltiVec is a standard part of the Power ISA v.2.03 specification. It was never formally a part of the PowerPC architecture until this specification although it used PowerPC instruction formats and syntax and occupied the opcode space expressly allocated for such 
purposes.

==Comparison to x86-64 SSE ==

Both VMX/AltiVec and SSE feature 128-bit vector registers that can represent sixteen 8-bit signed or unsigned chars, eight 16-bit signed or unsigned shorts, four 32-bit ints or four 32-bit floating-point variables. Both provide cache-control instructions intended to minimize cache pollution when working on streams of data.

They also exhibit important differences. Unlike SSE2, VMX/AltiVec supports a special RGB &quot;pixel&quot; data type, but it does not operate on 64-bit double-precision floats, and there is no way to move data directly between scalar and vector registers. In keeping with the &quot;load/store&quot; model of the PowerPC&#x27;s RISC design, the vector registers, like the scalar registers, can only be loaded from and stored to memory. However, VMX/AltiVec provides a much more complete set of &quot;horizontal&quot; operations that work across all the elements of a vector; the allowable combinations of data type and operations are much more complete. Thirty-two 128-bit vector registers are provided, compared to eight for SSE and SSE2 (extended to 16 in x86-64), and most VMX/AltiVec instructions take three register operands compared to only two register/register or register/memory operands on IA-32.

VMX/AltiVec is also unique in its support for a flexible vector permute instruction, in which each byte of a resulting vector value can be taken from any byte of either of two other vectors, parametrized by yet another vector. This allows for sophisticated manipulations in a single instruction.

Recent versions of the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), IBM VisualAge compiler and other compilers provide intrinsics to access VMX/AltiVec instructions directly from C and C++ programs. As of version 4, the GCC also includes auto-vectorization capabilities that attempt to intelligently create VMX/Altivec accelerated binaries without the need for the programmer to use intrinsics directly. The &quot;vector&quot; type keyword is introduced to permit the declaration of native vector types, e.g., &quot;codice_1&quot; declares a 128-bit vector variable named &quot;foo&quot; containing sixteen 8-bit unsigned chars. The full complement of arithmetic and binary operators is defined on vector types so that the normal C expression language can be used to manipulate vector variables. There are also overloaded intrinsic functions such as &quot;codice_2&quot; that emit the appropriate opcode based on the type of the elements within the vector, and very strong type checking is enforced. In contrast, the Intel-defined data types for IA-32 SIMD registers declare only the size of the vector register (128 or 64 bits) and in the case of a 128-bit register, whether it contains integers or floating-point values. The programmer must select the appropriate intrinsic for the data types in use, e.g., &quot;codice_3&quot; for adding two vectors containing eight 16-bit integers.

==Development history==
The Power Vector Media Extension (VMX) was developed between 1996 and 1998 by a collaborative project between Apple, IBM, and Motorola. 
Apple was the primary customer for Power Vector Media Extension (VMX) until Apple switched to Intel-made, x86-based CPUs on June 6, 2005. They used it to accelerate multimedia applications such as QuickTime, iTunes and key parts of Apple&#x27;s Mac OS X including in the Quartz graphics compositor. Other companies such as Adobe used AltiVec to optimize their image-processing programs such as Adobe Photoshop. Motorola was the first to supply AltiVec enabled processors starting with their G4 line. AltiVec was also used in some embedded systems for high-performance digital signal processing.

IBM consistently left VMX out of their earlier POWER microprocessors, which were intended for server applications where it was not very useful. The POWER6 microprocessor, introduced in 2007, implements AltiVec. The last desktop microprocessor from IBM, the PowerPC 970 (dubbed the &quot;G5&quot; by Apple) also implemented AltiVec with hardware similar to that of the PowerPC 7400.

AltiVec is a brandname trademarked by Freescale (previously Motorola) for the standard &quot;Category:Vector&quot; part of the Power ISA v.2.03 specification. This category is also known as VMX (used by IBM), and &quot;Velocity Engine&quot; (a brand name previously used by Apple).

The Cell Broadband Engine, used in (amongst other things) the PlayStation 3, also supports Power Vector Media Extension (VMX) in its PPU, with the SPU ISA being enhanced but architecturally similar.

Freescale is bringing an enhanced version of AltiVec to e6500 based QorIQ processors.

=== VMX128 ===
IBM enhanced VMX for use in Xenon (Xbox 360) and called this enhancement VMX128. The enhancements comprise new routines targeted at gaming (accelerating 3D graphics and game physics) and a total of 128 registers. VMX128 is not entirely compatible with VMX/Altivec, as a number of integer operations were removed to make space for the larger register file and additional application-specific operations. 

=== VSX (Vector Scalar Extension) ===
Power ISA v2.06 introduced VSX vector-scalar instructions which extend SIMD processing for the Power ISA to support up to 64 registers, with support for regular floating point, decimal floating point and vector execution. POWER7 is the first Power ISA processor to implement Power ISA v2.06.

New instructions are introduced by IBM under the Vector Media Extension category for integer operations as part of the VSX extension in Power ISA 2.07.

New integer vector instructions were introduced by IBM following the VMX encodings as part of the VSX extension in Power ISA v3.0. Shall be introduced with POWER9 processors.

== Issues ==
In C++, the standard way of accessing AltiVec support is mutually exclusive with the use of the Standard Template Library codice_4 class template due to the treatment of &quot;vector&quot; as a reserved word when the compiler does not implement the context-sensitive keyword version of vector. However, it may be possible to combine them using compiler-specific workarounds; for instance, in GCC one may do codice_5 to remove the codice_6 keyword, and then use the GCC-specific codice_7 keyword in its place.

AltiVec prior to Power ISA 2.06 with VSX lacks loading from memory using a type&#x27;s natural alignment. For example, the code below requires special handling for Power6 and below when the effective address is not 16-byte aligned. The special handling adds 3 additional instructions to a load operation when VSX is not available.
#include &lt;altivec.h&gt;
typedef __vector unsigned char uint8x16_p;
typedef __vector unsigned int uint32x4_p;
int main(int argc, char* argv)
 /* Natural alignment of vals is 4; and not 16 as required */
 unsigned int vals[4] = { 1, 2, 3, 4 };
 uint32x4_p vec;

#if defined(__VSX__) || defined(_ARCH_PWR8)
 vec = vec_xl(0, vals);
#else
 const uint8x16_p perm = vec_lvsl(0, vals);
 const uint8x16_p low = vec_ld(0, vals);
 const uint8x16_p high = vec_ld(15, vals);
 vec = (uint32x4_p)vec_perm(low, high, perm);
#endif

AltiVec prior to Power ISA 2.06 with VMX lacks 64-bit integer support. Developers who wish to operate on 64-bit data will develop routines from 32-bit components. For example, below are examples of 64-bit codice_8 and codice_9 in C using a vector with four 32-bit words on a big-endian machine. The permutes move the carry and borrow bits from columns 1 and 3 to columns 0 and 2 like in school-book math. A little-endian machine would need a different mask.

#include &lt;altivec.h&gt;
typedef __vector unsigned char uint8x16_p;
typedef __vector unsigned int uint32x4_p;

/* Performs a+b as if the vector held two 64-bit double words */
uint32x4_p add64(const uint32x4_p a, const uint32x4_p b)
 const uint8x16_p cmask = {4,5,6,7, 16,16,16,16, 12,13,14,15, 16,16,16,16};
 const uint32x4_p zero = {0, 0, 0, 0};

 uint32x4_p cy = vec_addc(vec1, vec2);
 cy = vec_perm(cy, zero, cmask);
 return vec_add(vec_add(vec1, vec2), cy);

/* Performs a-b as if the vector held two 64-bit double words */
uint32x4_p sub64(const uint32x4_p a, const uint32x4_p b)
 const uint8x16_p bmask = {4,5,6,7, 16,16,16,16, 12,13,14,15, 16,16,16,16};
 const uint32x4_p amask = {1, 1, 1, 1};
 const uint32x4_p zero = {0, 0, 0, 0};

 uint32x4_p bw = vec_subc(vec1, vec2);
 bw = vec_andc(amask, bw);
 bw = vec_perm(bw, zero, bmask);
 return vec_sub(vec_sub(vec1, vec2), bw);

Power ISA 2.07 used in Power8 finally provided the 64-bit double words. A developer working with Power8 needs only to perform the following.

#include &lt;altivec.h&gt;
typedef __vector unsigned long long uint64x2_p;

/* Performs a+b using native vector 64-bit double words */
uint64x2_p add64(const uint64x2_p a, const uint64x2_p b)
 return vec_add(a, b);

/* Performs a-b using native vector 64-bit double words */
uint64x2_p sub64(const uint64x2_p a, const uint64x2_p b)
 return vec_sub(a, b);

<doc id="55364" wikidata="Q904336" url="?curid=55364" title="MMX (instruction set)">
<text>MMX is a &quot;single instruction, multiple data&quot; (SIMD) instruction set architecture designed by Intel, introduced on January 8, 1997 with its Pentium P5 (microarchitecture) based line of microprocessors, named &quot;Pentium with MMX Technology&quot;. It developed out of a similar unit introduced on the Intel i860, and earlier the Intel i750 video pixel processor. MMX is a processor supplementary capability that is supported on IA-32 processors by Intel and other vendors . AMD also added MMX instruction set in its K6 processor.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; described the initial push, including Super Bowl advertisements, as focused on &quot;a new generation of glitzy multimedia products, including videophones and 3-D video games.&quot;

MMX has subsequently been extended by several programs by Intel and others: 3DNow!, Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE), and ongoing revisions of Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX).

==Overview==
===Naming===
MMX is officially a meaningless initialism trademarked by Intel; unofficially, the initials have been variously explained as standing for 
* &quot;MultiMedia eXtension&quot;, or 
* &quot;Matrix Math eXtension&quot;.

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), during one of its many court battles with Intel, produced marketing material from Intel indicating that MMX stood for &quot;Matrix Math Extensions&quot;. Since an initialism cannot be trademarked, this was an attempt to invalidate Intel&#x27;s trademark. In 1995, Intel filed suit against AMD and Cyrix Corp. for misuse of its trademark MMX. AMD and Intel settled, with AMD acknowledging MMX as a trademark owned by Intel, and with Intel granting AMD rights to use the MMX trademark as a technology name, but not a processor name.

===Technical details===

MMX defines eight processor registers, named MM0 through MM7, and operations that operate on them. Each register is 64 bits wide and can be used to hold either 64-bit integers, or multiple smaller integers in a &quot;packed&quot; format: one instruction can then be applied to two 32-bit integers, four 16-bit integers, or eight 8-bit integers at once.

MMX provides only integer operations. When originally developed, for the Intel i860, the use of integer math made sense (both 2D and 3D calculations required it), but as graphics cards that did much of this became common, integer SIMD in the CPU became somewhat redundant for graphical applications. Alternatively, the saturation arithmetic operations in MMX could significantly speed up some digital signal processing applications.

To avoid compatibility problems with the context switch mechanisms in existing operating systems, the MMX registers are aliases for the existing x87 floating-point unit (FPU) registers, which context switches would already save and restore. Unlike the x87 registers, which behave like a stack, the MMX registers are each directly addressable (random access).

Any operation involving the floating-point stack might also affect the MMX registers and vice versa, so this aliasing makes it difficult to work with floating-point and SIMD operations in the same program. To maximize performance, software often used the processor exclusively in one mode or the other, deferring the relatively slow switch between them as long as possible.

Each 64-bit MMX register corresponds to the mantissa part of an 80-bit x87 register. The upper 16 bits of the x87 registers thus go unused in MMX, and these bits are all set to ones, making them &quot;Not a Number&quot; (NaN) data types, or infinities in the floating-point representation. This can be used by software to decide whether a given register&#x27;s content is intended as floating-point or SIMD data.

===Software support===
Software support for MMX developed slowly. Intel&#x27;s C Compiler and related development tools obtained intrinsics for invoking MMX instructions and Intel released libraries of common vectorized algorithms using MMX. Both Intel and Metrowerks attempted automatic vectorization in their compilers, but the operations in the C programming language mapped poorly onto the MMX instruction set and custom algorithms as of 2000 typically still had to be written in assembly language.

==Successors==
AMD, a competing x86 microprocessor vendor, enhanced Intel&#x27;s MMX with their own 3DNow! instruction set. 3DNow is best known for adding single-precision (32-bit) floating-point support to the SIMD instruction-set, among other integer and more general enhancements.

Following MMX, Intel&#x27;s next major x86 extension was the Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE), introduced with the Pentium III family in 1999, roughly a year after AMD&#x27;s 3DNow! was introduced.

SSE addressed the core shortcomings of MMX (inability to mix integer-SIMD ops with any floating-point ops) by creating a new 128-bit wide register file (XMM0–XMM7) and new SIMD instructions for it. Like 3DNow!, SSE focused exclusively on single-precision floating-point operations (32-bit); integer SIMD operations were still performed using the MMX register and instruction set. However, the new XMM register-file allowed SSE SIMD-operations to be freely mixed with either MMX or x87 FPU ops.

&quot;Streaming SIMD Extensions 2&quot; (SSE2), introduced with the Pentium 4, further extended the x86 SIMD instruction set with integer (8/16/32 bit) and double-precision floating-point data support for the XMM register file. SSE2 also allowed the MMX &quot;operation codes&quot; (opcodes) to use XMM register operands, extended to even wider YMM and ZMM registers by later SSE revisions.

== MMX in embedded applications ==
Intel&#x27;s and Marvell Technology Group&#x27;s XScale microprocessor core starting with PXA270 include an SIMD instruction set architecture extension to the ARM architecture core named &quot;Intel Wireless MMX Technology&quot; (iwMMXt) which functions are similar to those of the IA-32 MMX extension. It provides arithmetic and logic operations on 64-bit integer numbers, in which the software may choose to instead perform two 32-bit, four 16-bit or eight 8-bit operations in one instruction. The extension contains 16 data registers of 64-bits and eight control registers of 32-bits. All registers are accessed through standard ARM architecture coprocessor mapping mechanism. iwMMXt occupies coprocessors 0 and 1 space, and some of its opcodes clash with the opcodes of the earlier floating-point extension, FPA.

Later versions of Marvell&#x27;s ARM processors support both &quot;Wireless MMX&quot; (WMMX) and &quot;Wireless MMX2&quot; (WMMX2) opcodes.

<text>In computing, Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE) is a single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) instruction set extension to the x86 architecture, designed by Intel and introduced in 1999 in its Pentium III series of central processing units (CPUs) shortly after the appearance of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD&#x27;s) 3DNow!. SSE contains 70 new instructions (65 unique mnemonics using 70 encodings), most of which work on single precision floating-point data. SIMD instructions can greatly increase performance when exactly the same operations are to be performed on multiple data objects. Typical applications are digital signal processing and graphics processing.

Intel&#x27;s first IA-32 SIMD effort was the MMX instruction set. MMX had two main problems: it re-used existing x87 floating-point registers making the CPUs unable to work on both floating-point and SIMD data at the same time, and it only worked on integers. SSE floating-point instructions operate on a new independent register set, the XMM registers, and adds a few integer instructions that work on MMX registers.

SSE was subsequently expanded by Intel to SSE2, SSE3, SSSE3 and SSE4. Because it supports floating-point math, it had wider applications than MMX and became more popular. The addition of integer support in SSE2 made MMX largely redundant, though further performance increases can be attained in some situations by using MMX in parallel with SSE operations.

SSE was originally called Katmai New Instructions (KNI), Katmai being the code name for the first Pentium III core revision. During the Katmai project Intel sought to distinguish it from its earlier product line, particularly its flagship Pentium II. It was later renamed Internet Streaming SIMD Extensions (ISSE), then SSE. 

AMD added a subset of SSE, 19 of them, called new MMX instructions, and known as several variants and combinations of SSE and MMX, shortly after with the release of the original Athlon in August 1999, see 3DNow! extensions. AMD eventually added full support for SSE instructions, starting with its Athlon XP and Duron (Morgan core) processors.

== Registers ==
SSE originally added eight new 128-bit registers known as codice_1 through codice_2. The AMD64 extensions from AMD (originally called &quot;x86-64&quot;) added a further eight registers codice_3 through codice_4, and this extension is duplicated in the Intel 64 architecture. There is also a new 32-bit control/status register, codice_5. The registers codice_3 through codice_4 are accessible only in 64-bit operating mode.


SSE used only a single data type for XMM registers:
* four 32-bit single-precision floating-point numbers

SSE2 would later expand the usage of the XMM registers to include:
* two 64-bit double-precision floating-point numbers or
* two 64-bit integers or
* four 32-bit integers or
* eight 16-bit short integers or
* sixteen 8-bit bytes or characters.

Because these 128-bit registers are additional machine states that the operating system must preserve across task switches, they are disabled by default until the operating system explicitly enables them. This means that the OS must know how to use the codice_8 and codice_9 instructions, which is the extended pair of instructions that can save all x86 and SSE register states at once. This support was quickly added to all major IA-32 operating systems.

The first CPU to support SSE, the Pentium III, shared execution resources between SSE and the floating-point unit (FPU). While a compiled application can interleave FPU and SSE instructions side-by-side, the Pentium III will not issue an FPU and an SSE instruction in the same clock cycle. This limitation reduces the effectiveness of pipelining, but the separate XMM registers do allow SIMD and scalar floating-point operations to be mixed without the performance hit from explicit MMX/floating-point mode switching.

== SSE instructions ==
SSE introduced both scalar and packed floating-point instructions.

=== Floating-point instructions ===
* Memory-to-register/register-to-memory/register-to-register data movement
** Scalar – codice_10
** Packed – codice_11
* Arithmetic
** Scalar – codice_12
** Packed – codice_13
* Compare
** Scalar – codice_14
** Packed – codice_15
* Data shuffle and unpacking
** Packed – codice_16
* Data-type conversion
** Scalar – codice_17
** Packed – codice_18
* Bitwise logical operations
** Packed – codice_19

=== Integer instructions ===
* Arithmetic
** codice_20
* Data movement
** codice_21
* Other
** codice_22

=== Other instructions ===
* codice_5 management
** codice_24
* Cache and Memory management
** codice_25

== Example ==
The following simple example demonstrates the advantage of using SSE. Consider an operation like vector addition, which is used very often in computer graphics applications. To add two single precision, four-component vectors together using x86 requires four floating-point addition instructions.
 vec_res.x = v1.x + v2.x;
 vec_res.y = v1.y + v2.y;
 vec_res.z = v1.z + v2.z;
 vec_res.w = v1.w + v2.w;
This corresponds to four x86 FADD instructions in the object code. On the other hand, as the following pseudo-code shows, a single 128-bit &#x27;packed-add&#x27; instruction can replace the four scalar addition instructions.

 movaps xmm0, [v1] ;xmm0 = v1.w | v1.z | v1.y | v1.x 
 addps xmm0, [v2] ;xmm0 = v1.w+v2.w | v1.z+v2.z | v1.y+v2.y | v1.x+v2.x
 movaps [vec_res], xmm0 ;xmm0
== Later versions ==
* SSE2, Willamette New Instructions (WNI), introduced with the Pentium 4, is a major enhancement to SSE. SSE2 adds two major features: double-precision (64-bit) floating-point for all SSE operations, and MMX integer operations on 128-bit XMM registers. In the original SSE instruction set, conversion to and from integers placed the integer data in the 64-bit MMX registers. SSE2 enables the programmer to perform SIMD math on any data type (from 8-bit integer to 64-bit float) entirely with the XMM vector-register file, without the need to use the legacy MMX or FPU registers. It offers an orthogonal set of instructions for dealing with common data types.
* SSE3, also called Prescott New Instructions (PNI), is an incremental upgrade to SSE2, adding a handful of DSP-oriented mathematics instructions and some process (thread) management instructions. It also allowed addition or multiplication of two numbers that are stored in the same register, which wasn&#x27;t possible in SSE2 and earlier. This capability, known as horizontal in Intel terminology, was the major addition to the SSE3 instruction set. AMD&#x27;s 3DNow! extension could do the latter too.
* SSSE3, Merom New Instructions (MNI), is an upgrade to SSE3, adding 16 new instructions which include permuting the bytes in a word, multiplying 16-bit fixed-point numbers with correct rounding, and within-word accumulate instructions. SSSE3 is often mistaken for SSE4 as this term was used during the development of the Core microarchitecture.
* SSE4, Penryn New Instructions (PNI), is another major enhancement, adding a dot product instruction, additional integer instructions, a popcnt instruction (Population count: count number of bits set to 1, used extensively e.g. in cryptography), and more.
* XOP, FMA4 and CVT16 are new iterations announced by AMD in August 2007 and revised in May 2009.
* Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX), Gesher New Instructions (GNI), is an advanced version of SSE announced by Intel featuring a widened data path from 128 bits to 256 bits and 3-operand instructions (up from 2). Intel released processors in early 2011 with AVX support.
* AVX2 is an expansion of the AVX instruction set.
* AVX-512 (3.1 and 3.2) are 512-bit extensions to the 256-bit Advanced Vector Extensions SIMD instructions for x86 instruction set architecture.

<doc id="55374" wikidata="Q1609610" url="?curid=55374" title="Hercules (emulator)">
<text>Hercules is a computer emulator allowing software written for IBM mainframe computers (System/370, System/390, and zSeries/System z) and for plug compatible mainframes (such as Amdahl machines) to run on other types of computer hardware, notably on low-cost personal computers. Development started in 1999 by Roger Bowler, a mainframe systems programmer.

Hercules runs under multiple parent operating systems including Linux, Microsoft Windows, FreeBSD, NetBSD, Solaris, and macOS and is released under the open source software license QPL. It is analogous to Bochs and QEMU in that it emulates CPU instructions and select peripheral devices only. A vendor (or distributor) must still provide an operating system, and the user must install it. Hercules was the first mainframe emulator to incorporate 64-bit z/Architecture support.

==Design==
The emulator is written almost entirely in C. Its developers ruled out using machine-specific assembly code to avoid problems with portability even though such code could significantly improve performance. There are two exceptions: Hercules uses hardware assists to provide inter-processor consistency when emulating multiple CPUs on SMP host systems, and Hercules uses assembler assists to convert between little-endian and big-endian data on platforms where the operating system provides such services and on x86/x86-64 processors.

==Operating systems status==
Hercules is technically compatible with all IBM mainframe operating systems, even older versions which no longer run on newer mainframes. However, many mainframe operating systems require vendor licenses to run legally. Newer licensed operating systems, such as OS/390, z/OS, VSE/ESA, z/VSE, VM/ESA, z/VM, TPF/ESA, and z/TPF are technically compatible but cannot legally run on the Hercules emulator except in very limited circumstances, and they must always be licensed from IBM. IBM&#x27;s Coupling Facility control code, which enables Parallel Sysplex, and UTS also require licenses to run.

Operating systems which may legally be run, without license costs, on Hercules include:
* Older IBM operating systems including OS/360, DOS/360, DOS/VS, MVS, VM/370, and TSS/370 which are either public domain or &quot;copyrighted software provided without charge.&quot;
* The MUSIC/SP operating system may be available for educational and demonstration purposes upon request to its copyright holder, McGill University. Some of MUSIC/SP&#x27;s features, notably networking, require z/VM (and thus an IBM license). However, a complete demonstration version of MUSIC/SP, packaged with the alternative Sim390 mainframe emulator, is available.
* The Michigan Terminal System (MTS) version 6.0A has been tailored to run under Hercules.
* There is no known legal restriction to running open-source operating systems Linux on IBM Z and OpenSolaris for System z on the Hercules emulator. They run well on Hercules, and many Linux on IBM Z developers do their work using Hercules. Several distributors provide 64-bit z/Architecture versions of Linux, and some also provide ESA/390-compatible versions. Mainframe Linux distributions include SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Debian, CentOS, and Slackware. Sine Nomine Associates brought OpenSolaris to System z, relying on features provided by z/VM. Emulation of those specific z/VM features for OpenSolaris is included starting with Hercules Version 3.07.
* Certain unencumbered editors and utilities which can run on a mainframe without a parent operating system may be available to run on Hercules as well.

* PDOS/3X0 (Public Domain Operating System, mainframe version)

==Usage==
Hercules can be used as a development environment to verify that code is portable (across Linux processor architectures, for example), supports symmetric multiprocessing (SMP), and is 64-bit &quot;clean.&quot;

There is also a large community of current and former mainframe operators and programmers, as well as those with no prior experience, who use Hercules and the public domain IBM operating systems as a hobby and for learning purposes. Most of the skills acquired when exploring classic IBM mainframe operating system versions are still relevant when transitioning to licensed IBM machines running the latest versions.

The open source nature of Hercules means that anyone can produce their own customized version of the emulator. For example, a group of developers independent of the Hercules project implemented a hybrid mainframe architecture which they dubbed &quot;S/380&quot; using modifications to both Hercules and to freely available classic versions of MVS (and later VM and DOS/VS), enhancing the operating systems with some degree of 31-bit (and as of 2016, 64-bit) binary compatibility with later operating system versions (and as of 2018, 32-bit is also supported).

==Performance==
It is difficult to determine exactly how Hercules emulation performance corresponds to real mainframe hardware, but the performance characteristics are understandably quite different. This is partially due to the difficulty of comparing real mainframe hardware to other PCs and servers as well as the lack of concrete, controlled performance comparisons. Performance comparisons are likely legally impossible for licensed IBM operating systems, and those operating systems are quite different from other operating systems, such as Linux.

Hercules expresses its processing performance in MIPS. Due to the age of the earlier System/360 and System/370 hardware, it is a relatively safe assumption that Hercules will outperform them when running on moderately powerful hardware, despite the considerable overhead of emulating a computer architecture in software. However, newer, partially or fully configured System z machines outperform Hercules by a wide margin. A relatively fast dual processor X86 machine running Hercules is capable of sustaining about 50 to 60 MIPS for code that utilizes both processors in a realistic environment, with sustained rates rising to a reported 300 MIPS on leading-edge (early 2009) PC-class systems. Hercules can produce peaks of over 1200 MIPS when running in a tight loop, such as in a synthetic instruction benchmark or with other small, compute-intensive programs.

Tom Lehmann, co-founder of TurboHercules, wrote:
Hercules generally outperforms IBM&#x27;s PC based mainframes from the mid-1990s, which have an advertised peak performance of around 29 MIPS. Compared to the more powerful but still entry-level IBM Multiprise 2000 and 3000 mainframes (also from the 1990s), Hercules on typical x86 hardware would be considered a mid-range server in performance terms. For every mainframe after the 9672 Generation 1, Hercules would generally be the lowest end system. For comparison, 2010-era high-end IBM zEnterprise 196 systems can deliver over 52,000 MIPS per machine, and they have considerable I/O performance advantages. With the same number of emulated Sys Z processors, z/PDT is about 3 times faster than Hercules.

Note that there are other non-functional system attributes beyond performance which are typically relevant to mainframe operators. These include high availability, failover, hot-plug CPU and RAM, I/O routing over I/O meshes, system migration and LPAR management. For example, the 370/390/ESA/z architectures implement I/O using four instructions: large, complex I/O operations can be set up and handed over to the peripheral for processing; the CPU has no further involvement in the I/O until the I/O device notifies that it has completed the operation. This results in mainframe systems where the vast majority of &quot;CPU cycles&quot; are used not in mainframe CPU itself, but the assortment of processors embedded in the I/O peripherals. The mainframe CPU then acts more as orchestra conductor, coordinating data movement, rather than &quot;computing&quot; per se. The simplest I/O devices can be emulated; complex systems would pose a challenge.

==TurboHercules==
In 2009, Roger Bowler founded TurboHercules SAS, based in France, to commercialize the Hercules technology. In July 2009, TurboHercules SAS asked IBM to license z/OS to its customers for use on systems sold by TurboHercules. IBM declined the company&#x27;s request. In March 2010, TurboHercules SAS filed a complaint with European Commission regulators, alleging that IBM infringed EU antitrust rules through its alleged tying of mainframe hardware to its mainframe operating system, and the EC opened a preliminary investigation. In November 2010, TurboHercules announced that it had received an investment from Microsoft Corporation. In September 2011, EC regulators closed their investigation without action.

<doc id="55380" wikidata="Q624167" url="?curid=55380" title="Disk partitioning">
<text>Disk partitioning or disk slicing is the creation of one or more regions on secondary storage, so that each region can be managed separately. These regions are called partitions. It is typically the first step of preparing a newly installed disk after a partitioning scheme is chosen for the new disk before any file system is created. The disk stores the information about the partitions&#x27; locations and sizes in an area known as the partition table that the operating system reads before any other part of the disk. Each partition then appears to the operating system as a distinct &quot;logical&quot; disk that uses part of the actual disk. System administrators use a program called a partition editor to create, resize, delete, and manipulate the partitions. Partitioning allows the use of different filesystems to be installed for different kinds of files. Separating user data from system data can prevent the system partition from becoming full and rendering the system unusable. Partitioning can also make backing up easier. A disadvantage is that it can be difficult to properly size partitions, resulting in having one partition with too much free space and another nearly totally allocated.

==History==
IBM in its 1983 release of PC DOS version 2.0 was an early if not first use of the term &quot;partition&quot; to describe dividing a block storage device such as an HDD into physical segments. The term&#x27;s usage is now ubiquitous. Other terms used include &quot;logical disk&quot;, &quot;minidisk&quot;, &quot;portions&quot;, &quot;pseudo-disk&quot;, &quot;section&quot;, &quot;slice&quot; and &quot;virtual drive&quot;.

One of the earliest such segmentation of a disk drive was IBM&#x27;s 1966 usage in its CP-67 operating system of &quot;minidisk&quot; as a separate segment of a hard disk drive.

== Partitioning schemes ==
=== DOS, Windows, and OS/2 ===
With DOS, Microsoft Windows, and OS/2, a common practice is to use one primary partition for the active file system that will contain the operating system, the page/swap file, all utilities, applications, and user data. On most Windows consumer computers, the drive letter C: is routinely assigned to this primary partition. Other partitions may exist on the HDD that may or may not be visible as drives, such as recovery partitions or partitions with diagnostic tools or data. (Windows drive letters do not correspond to partitions in a one-to-one fashion, so there may be more or fewer drive letters than partitions.)

Microsoft Windows 2000, XP, Vista, and Windows 7 include a &#x27;Disk Management&#x27; program which allows for the creation, deletion and resizing of FAT and NTFS partitions. The Windows Disk Manager in Windows Vista and Windows 7 utilizes a 1 MB partition alignment scheme which is fundamentally incompatible with Windows 2000, XP, OS/2, DOS as well as many other operating systems.

=== Unix-like systems ===
On Unix-based and Unix-like operating systems such as Linux, macOS, BSD, and Solaris, it is possible to use multiple partitions on a disk device. Each partition can be formatted with a file system or as a swap partition.

Multiple partitions allow directories such as /boot, /tmp, /usr, /var, or /home to be allocated their own filesystems. Such a scheme has a number of advantages:

* If one file system gets corrupted, the data outside that filesystem/partition may stay intact, minimizing data loss.
* Specific file systems can be mounted with different parameters, e.g., read-only, or with the execution of setuid files disabled.
* A runaway program that uses up all available space on a non-system filesystem does not fill up critical filesystems.
* Keeping user data such as documents separate from system files allows the system to be updated with lessened risk of disturbing the data.

A common minimal configuration for Linux systems is to use three partitions: one holding the system files mounted on &quot;/&quot; (the root directory), one holding user configuration files and data mounted on /home (home directory), and a swap partition.

By default, macOS systems also use a single partition for the entire filesystem and use a swap file inside the file system (like Windows) rather than a swap partition.

In Solaris, partitions are sometimes known as slices. This is a conceptual reference to the slicing of a cake into several pieces.

The term &quot;slice&quot; is used in the FreeBSD operating system to refer to Master Boot Record partitions, to avoid confusion with FreeBSD&#x27;s own disklabel-based partitioning scheme. However, GUID Partition Table partitions are referred to as &quot;partition&quot; worldwide.

=== Multi-boot systems ===
Multi-boot systems are computers where the user can boot into more than one distinct operating system (OS) stored in separate storage devices or in separate partitions of the same storage device. In such systems a menu at startup gives a choice of which OS to boot/start (and only one OS at a time is loaded).

This is distinct from virtual operating systems, in which one operating system is run as a self-contained virtual &quot;program&quot; within another already-running operating system. (An example is a Windows OS &quot;virtual machine&quot; running from within a Linux OS.)

=== GUID Partition Table ===

The GUID Partition Table (Globally Unique IDentifier) is a part of the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) standard for the layout of the partition table on a physical hard disk. Many operating systems now support this standard. However, Windows does not support this on BIOS based computers.

== Partition recovery ==
When a partition is deleted, its entry is removed from a table and the data is no longer accessible. The data remains on the disk until it is overwritten. Specialized recovery utilities may be able to locate &quot;lost&quot; file systems and recreate a partition table which includes entries for these recovered file systems. Some disk utilities may overwrite a number of beginning sectors of a partition they delete. For example, if Windows Disk Management (Windows 2000/XP, etc.) is used to delete a partition, it will overwrite the first sector (relative sector 0) of the partition before removing it. It still may be possible to restore a FAT or NTFS partition if a backup boot sector is available.

== Compressed disks ==
HDDs can be compressed to create additional space. In DOS and early Microsoft Windows, programs such as Stacker (DR-DOS except 6.0), SuperStor (DR DOS 6.0), DoubleSpace (MS-DOS 6.0–6.2), or DriveSpace (MS-DOS 6.22, Windows 9x) were used. This compression was done by creating a very large file on the partition, then storing the disk&#x27;s data in this file. At startup, device drivers opened this file and assigned it a separate letter. Frequently, to avoid confusion, the original partition and the compressed drive had their letters swapped, so that the compressed disk is C:, and the uncompressed area (often containing system files) is given a higher name.

Versions of Windows using the NT kernel, including the most recent version, Windows 10, contain intrinsic disk compression capability. The use of separate disk compression utilities has declined sharply.

== Partition table ==
A partition table is a table maintained on a disk by the operating system that outlines and describes the partitions on that disk. The terms &quot;partition table&quot; and &quot;partition map&quot; are similar terms and can be used interchangeably. The term is most commonly associated with the MBR partition table of a Master Boot Record (MBR) in PCs, but it may be used generically to refer to other formats that divide a disk drive into partitions, such as: GUID Partition Table (GPT), Apple partition map (APM), or BSD disklabel.

== PC partition types ==

=== MBR ===

This section describes the master boot record (MBR) partitioning scheme, as used historically in DOS, Microsoft Windows and Linux (among others) on PC-compatible computer systems. As of the mid-2010s, most new computers use the GUID Partition Table (GPT) partitioning scheme instead. For examples of other partitioning schemes, see the general article on partition tables.

The total data storage space of a PC HDD on which MBR partitioning is implemented can contain at most four &quot;primary partitions&quot;, or alternatively three primary partitions and an &quot;extended partition&quot;. The &quot;Partition Table&quot;, located in the master boot record, contains 16-byte entries, each of which describes a partition.

The &quot;partition type&quot; is identified by a 1-byte code found in its partition table entry. Some of these codes (such as and ) may be used to indicate the presence of an extended partition. Most are used by an operating system&#x27;s bootloader (that examines partition tables) to decide if a partition contains a file system that can be &quot;mounted / accessed&quot; for reading or writing data.

=== Primary partition ===

A primary partition contains one file system. In DOS and all early versions of Microsoft Windows systems, Microsoft required what it called the system partition to be the first partition. All Windows operating systems from Windows 95 onwards can be located on (almost) any partition, but the boot files (codice_1, codice_2, codice_3, etc.) must reside on a primary partition. However, other factors, such as a PC&#x27;s BIOS (see Boot sequence on standard PC) may also impose specific requirements as to which partition must contain the primary OS.

The partition type &quot;code&quot; for a primary partition can either correspond to a file system contained within (e.g., means either an NTFS or an OS/2 HPFS file system) or indicate that the partition has a special use (e.g., code usually indicates a Linux &quot;swap&quot; partition). The FAT16 and FAT32 file systems have made use of a number of partition type codes due to the limits of various DOS and Windows OS versions. Though a Linux operating system may recognize a number of different file systems (ext4, ext3, ext2, ReiserFS, etc.), they have all consistently used the same partition type code: (Linux native file system).

=== Extended partition ===

An HDD may contain only one extended partition, but that extended partition can be subdivided into multiple logical partitions. DOS/Windows systems may then assign a unique drive letter to each logical partition. GUID partition table (GPT) only has the primary partition, doesn&#x27;t have the extended partition and the logical partition.

=== Boot partitions ===
==== BIOS boot partition ====
BIOS boot partition (BIOS BP) is a share of the storage device used to keep software that boots the operating system, a bootloader. It may be an operating system kernel image or bootloader or a completely separate piece of software.

==== EFI system partition ====
EFI system partition is the same as BIOS BP, but is loaded by EFI firmware instead of BIOS.
