<text>A mental disorder is an impairment of the mind disrupting normal thinking, feeling, mood, behavior, or social interactions, and accompanied by significant distress or dysfunction. The causes of mental disorders are very complex and vary depending on the particular disorder and the individual. Although the causes of most mental disorders are not fully understood, researchers have identified a variety of biological, psychological, and environmental factors that can contribute to the development or progression of mental disorders. Most mental disorders result in a combination of several different factors rather than just a single factor.

==Research results==
Risk factors for mental illness include psychological trauma, adverse childhood experiences, genetic predisposition, and personality traits. Correlations between mental disorders and substance use are also found to have a two way relationship, in that substance use can lead to the development of mental disorders and having mental disorders can lead to substance use/abuse. This effect is stronger and more reliable in some substance use than others, such as smoking.

Mental illnesses have risk factors, for instance including unequal parental treatment, adverse life events and drug use in depression, migration and discrimination, childhood trauma, loss or separation in families, and cannabis use in schizophrenia and psychosis, and parenting factors, child abuse, family history (e.g. of anxiety), and temperament and attitudes (e.g. pessimism) in anxiety. Many psychiatric disorders include problems with impulse and other emotional control.

In February 2013, a study found genetic links between five major psychiatric disorders: autism, ADHD, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and schizophrenia. Abnormal functioning of neurotransmitter systems is also responsible for some mental disorders, including serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine, and glutamate system&#x27;s abnormal functioning. Differences have also been found in the size or activity of specific brain regions in some cases. Psychological mechanisms have also been implicated, such as cognitive (e.g. reasoning) biases, emotional influences, personality dynamics, temperament, and coping style. Studies have indicated that variation in genes can play an important role in the evolution of mental disorders, although the reliable identification of connections between specific genes and specific disorders has proven more difficult. Environmental events surrounding pregnancy (such as maternal hypertension, preeclampsia, or infection) and birth have also been implicated. Traumatic brain injury may increase the risk of developing certain mental disorders. Throughout the years, there have been inconsistent links found to certain viral infections, substance misuse, and general physical health that have been false.

Adverse experiences affect a person&#x27;s mental health, including abuse, neglect, bullying, social stress, traumatic events, and other overwhelming life experiences. The specific risks and pathways to particular disorders are less clear, however. Aspects of the wider community have also been implicated, including employment problems, socioeconomic inequality, lack of social cohesion, problems linked to migration, and features of particular societies and cultures. Mental stress is a common cause of mental illnesses, so finding a coping solution to cope with mental stress would be beneficial. Many solutions that have helped reduce stress are yoga, exercise, and some medications that may help.

==Theories==

===General theories===

Several theories or models seek to explain the causes (etiology) of mental disorders. These theories may differ in regards to how they explain the cause of the disorder, how to treat the disorder, and how they classify mental disorders. Theories also differ about the philosophy of mind they accept; that is, whether the mind and brain are identical or not. 

During most of the 20th century, mental illness was ascribable to problematic relationships between children and their parents. This view was held well into the late 1990s, in which people still believed this child-parent relationship was a large determinant of severe mental illness, such as depression and schizophrenia. In the 21st century, additional factors have been identified such as genetic contributions, though experience also plays a role. So, the perceived causes of mental illness have changed over time and will most likely continue to alter while more research develops throughout the years.

Outside the West, community approaches remain a focus.

A practical mixture of models will explain particular issues and disorders, although there may be difficulty defining boundaries for indistinct psychiatric syndromes.

===Medical or biomedical model===
An overall distinction is also commonly made between a &quot;medical model&quot; (also known as a biomedical or disease model) and a &quot;social model&quot; (also known as an empowerment or recovery model) of mental disorder and disability, with the former focusing on hypothesized disease processes and symptoms, along with latter focusing on hypothesized social constructionism and social contexts.

Biological psychiatry has tended to follow a biomedical model focused on organic or &quot;hardware&quot; pathology of the brain, where many mental disorders are conceptualized as disorders of brain circuits shaped by a complex interplay of genetics and experience.

The social and medical models of mental disorders each work to identify and study distinct aspects, solutions, and potential therapies of disorders. The intersection and cross reference between the two models can further be used to develop more holistic models of mental disorders. Many criticisms historically of each model is the exclusivity of the other perspective. Therefore, intersectional research improved the impact and importance of future findings.

===Biopsychosocial model===
The primary model of contemporary mainstream Western psychiatry is the biopsychosocial model (BPS), which integrates biological, psychological, and social factors. The Biopsychosocial model was first conceptualised by George Engel in 1977, suggesting that to understand a person&#x27;s medical condition it is not simply the biological factors to consider, but also the psychological and social factors . The biopsychosocial approach systematically considers biological, psychological, and social factors and their complex interactions in understanding health, illness, and health care delivery. Biological, psychological, and social factors exist along a continuum of natural systems. The factors within the model contain the following:

* Biological (physiological pathology)
* Psychological (thoughts emotions and behaviours such as psychological distress, fear/avoidance beliefs, current coping methods and attribution)
* Social (socio-economical, socio-environmental, and cultural factors such as work issues, family circumstances and benefits/economics)

This model is commonly used for case conceptualization of psychological disorders as well as chronic pain, with the view that the pain is a psychophysiological behavior pattern that cannot be categorised into biological, psychological, or social factors alone. 

A related view, the diathesis-stress model, posits that mental disorders result from genetic dispositions and environmental stressors, combining to cause patterns of distress or dysfunction. The model is one way to explain why some individuals are more vulnerable to mental disorders than others. Additionally, it explains why some people may develop a mental disorder after exposure to stressful life events while others do not.

===Psychoanalytic theories===
Psychoanalytic theories focus on unresolved internal and relational conflicts. These theories have been predicated as explanations of mental disorders. Many psychoanalytic groups are said to adhere to the biopsychosocial model and to accept an eclectic mix of subtypes of psychoanalysis. Sigmund Freud developed the psychoanalytic theory. This theory focuses on the impact of unconscious forces on human behavior. According to Freud, a personality has three parts: the id, ego, and superego. The id operates under the pleasure principle, the ego operates under the reality principle, and the superego is the &quot;conscience&quot; and incorporates what is and is not socially acceptable into a person&#x27;s value system. According to the psychoanalytic theory, there are five stages of psychosexual development that everyone goes through the oral stage, anal stage, phallic stage, latency stage, and genital stage. Mental disorders can be caused by an individual receiving too little or too much gratification in one of the psychosexual developmental stages. When this happens, the individual is said to be in that developmental stage.

=== Attachment theory ===
Attachment theory is a kind of evolutionary-psychological approach sometimes applied in the context of mental disorders, which focuses on the role of early caregiver-child relationships, responses to danger, and the search for a satisfying reproductive relationship in adulthood. According to this theory, a child&#x27;s attachment is to a nurturing adult, the more likely that child will maintain healthy relationships with others in their life. As found by the Strange Situation experiment run by Mary Ainsworth based on the formulations of John Bowlby, there are four patterns of attachment: secure attachment, avoidant attachment, disorganized attachment, and ambivalent attachment. Later research found the fourth pattern of attachment is known as disorganized disoriented attachment. Secure attachments reflect trust in the child-caretaker relationship while insecure attachment reflects mistrust. The security of attachment in a child affects the child&#x27;s emotional, cognitive, and social competence later in life.

===Evolutionary psychology===

Evolutionary psychology and evolutionary psychiatry posit that mental disorders involve the dysfunctional operation of mental modules adapted to ancestral physical or social environments but not necessarily to modern ones. Behavioral abnormalities that resemble human mental illness have been found in related species (great apes).

Other theories suggest that mental illness could have evolutionary &quot;advantages&quot; for the species, including enhancing creativity and stress to enhance survival by activating the flight-or-fight response in anticipation of danger.

Mania and depression could have benefited from seasonal changes by helping to increase energy levels during times of plenty and rejuvenating energy during times of scarcity. In this way, mania was set in motion during the spring and summer to facilitate energy for hunting; depression worked best during the winter, similar to how bears hibernate to recover their energy levels. This may explain the connection between circadian genes and Bipolar Disorder and explain the relationship between light and seasonal affective disorder.

==Biological factors==
Biological factors consist of anything physical that can cause adverse effects on a person&#x27;s mental health. Biological factors include genetics, prenatal damage, infections, exposure to toxins, brain defects or injuries, and substance abuse. Many professionals believe that the cause of mental disorders is the biology of the brain and the nervous system.

&quot;Mind&quot; mentions genetic factors, long-term physical health conditions, and head injuries or epilepsy (affecting behavior and mood) as factors that may trigger an episode of mental illness.

===Genetics===

Some rare mental disorders are caused only by genetics such as Huntington&#x27;s disease.

Family linkage and some twin studies have indicated that genetic factors often play a role in the heritability of mental disorders. The reliable identification of specific genetic variation can cause indication of higher risk to particular disorders, through linkage, Genome Wide Association Scores or association studies, has proven difficult. This is due to the complexity of interactions between genes, environmental events, and early development or the need for new research strategies. No specific gene results in a complex trait disorder, but specific variations of alleles result in higher risk for a trait. The heritability of behavioral traits associated with a mental disorder may be in permissive than in restrictive environments, and susceptibility genes probably work through both &quot;within-the-skin&quot; (physiological) pathways and &quot;outside-the-skin&quot; (behavioral and social) pathways. Investigations increasingly focus on links between genes and endophenotypes because they are more specific traits. Some include neurophysiological, biochemical, endocrinological, neuroanatomical, cognitive, or neuropsychological, rather than disease categories. Concerning a well-known mental disorder, schizophrenia, it is said with certainty that alleles (forms of genes) were responsible for this disorder. Some research has indicated only multiple, rare mutations are thought to alter neurodevelopmental pathways that can ultimately contribute to schizophrenia; virtually every rare structural mutation was different in each individual.

Research has shown that many conditions are polygenic meaning there are multiple defective genes rather than only one that is responsible for a disorder, and these genes may also be pleiotropic meaning that they cause multiple disorders, not just one. Schizophrenia and Alzheimer&#x27;s are both examples of hereditary mental disorders. When exonic genes encode for proteins, these proteins do not just affect one trait. The pathways that contribute to complex traits and phenotypes interact with multiple systems, even though proteins have specific functions. 
brain plasticity (neuroplasticity) raises questions of whether some brain differences may be caused by mental illnesses or by pre-existing and then causing them.
====Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder====

====Bipolar disorder====
===Prenatal damage===
Any damage that occurs to a fetus while still in its mother&#x27;s womb is considered prenatal damage. Mental disorders can develop if the pregnant mother uses drugs or alcohol or is exposed to illnesses or infections during pregnancy. 
Environmental events surrounding pregnancy and birth have increased the development of mental illness in the offspring. Some events may include maternal exposure to stress or trauma, conditions of famine, obstetric birth complications, infections, and gestational exposure to alcohol or cocaine. These factors have been hypothesized to affect areas of neurodevelopment, general development, and restrict neuroplasticity.

===Infection, disease and toxins===
====Infection====
There have been some findings of links between infection by the parasite Toxoplasma gondii and schizophrenia.

AIDS has been linked to some mental disorders. Research shows that infections and exposure to toxins such as HIV and streptococcus cause dementia. This HIV infection that makes its way to the brain is called encephalopathy which spreads itself through the brain leading to dementia. The infections or toxins that trigger a change in the brain chemistry can develop into a mental disorder.

Depression and emotional liability may be also be caused by babesiosis.

There is some evidence that there may be a relationship between BoDV-1 infection and psychiatric disease.

The research on Lyme disease caused by a deer tick and toxins is expanding the link between bacterial infections and mental illness.

====Disease====
Depression, anxiety, mania, psychosis, vegetative symptoms, cognitive deficit and consciousness impairment may be caused by internal disease as well as endocrine and metabolic disorders, deficiency states and neurologic disorders.

===Injury and brain defects===

Any damage to the brain can cause a mental disorder. The brain is the control system for the nervous system and the rest of the body. Without it, the body cannot function properly.

Increased mood swings, insane behavior, and substance abuse disorders are traumatic brain injury (TBI) examples. Findings on the relationship between TBI severity and prevalence of subsequent psychiatric disorders have been inconsistent, and occurrence relates to prior mental health problems. Direct neurophysiological effects in a complex interaction with personality, attitude, and social influences.

Head trauma classifies as either open or closed head injury. In open head injury, the skull is punctured and the brain tissue is demolished. Closed head injury is more common, the skull is not punctured because there is an impact of the brain against the skull that creates permanent structural damage (subdural hematoma). With both types, symptoms may disappear or persist over time. Typically the longer the length of time spent unconscious and the length of post-traumatic amnesia the worse the prognosis for the individual. The cognitive residual symptoms of head trauma are associated with the type of injury (either an open head injury or closed head injury) and the amount of tissue destroyed. Closed injury head trauma symptoms include; Deficits in abstract reasoning ability, judgment, memory, and marked personality changes. Open injury head trauma symptoms tend to be the experience of classic neuropsychological syndromes like aphasia, visual-spatial disorders, and types of memory or perceptual disorders.

Brain tumors are classified as either malignant and benign, and as intrinsic (directly infiltrate the parenchyma of the brain) or extrinsic (grows on the external surface of the brain and produces symptoms as a result of pressure on the brain tissue). Progressive cognitive changes associated with brain tumors may include confusion, poor comprehension, and even dementia. Symptoms tend to depend on the location of the tumor in the brain. For example, tumors on the frontal lobe tend to be associated with the sign of impairment of judgment, apathy, and loss of the ability to regulate/modulate behavior.

Findings have indicated abnormal functioning of brainstem structures in individuals with mental disorders such as schizophrenia, and other disorders that have to do with impairments in maintaining sustained attention. Some abnormalities in the average size or shape of some regions of the brain have been found in some disorders, reflecting genes and experiences. Studies of schizophrenia have tended to find enlarged ventricles and sometimes reduced volume of the cerebrum and hippocampus, while studies of (psychotic) bipolar disorder have sometimes found increased amygdala volume. Findings differ over whether volumetric abnormalities are risk factors or are only found alongside the course of mental health problems, possibly reflecting neurocognitive or emotional stress processes and medication use or substance use. Some studies have also found reduced hippocampal volumes in major depression, possibly worsening with time depression.

===Neurotransmitter systems===
Abnormal levels of dopamine activity correspond with several disorders (reduced in ADHD and OCD, and increased in schizophrenia). The dysfunction in serotonin and other monoamine neurotransmitters (norepinephrine and dopamine) correspond with certain mental disorders and their associated neural networks. Some include major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, phobias, post-traumatic stress disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. Studies of depleted levels of monoamine neurotransmitters show an association with depression and other psychiatric disorders, but &quot;... it should be questioned whether 5-HT [serotonin] represents just one of the final and not the main, factors in the neurological chain of events underlying psychopathological symptoms...&quot;

Simplistic &quot;chemical imbalance&quot; explanations for mental disorders have never received empirical support; and most prominent psychiatrists, neuroscientists, and psychologists have not espoused such ill-defined, facile etiological theories. Instead, neurotransmitter systems have been understood in the context of the diathesis-stress or biopsychosocial models. The following 1967 quote from renowned psychiatric and neuroscience researchers exemplifies this more sophisticated understanding (in contrast to the woolly &quot;chemical imbalance&quot; notion).

Whereas specific genetic factors may be of importance in the etiology of some, and possibly all, depressions, it is equally conceivable that early experiences of the infant or child may cause enduring biochemical changes, that may predispose some individuals to depressions in adulthood. It is not likely that changes in the metabolism of the biogenic amines alone will account for the complex phenomena of normal or pathological affect.

===Substance abuse===

Substance abuse, especially long-term abuse, can cause or exacerbate many mental disorders. Alcoholism is linked to depression while abuse of amphetamines and LSD can leave a person feeling paranoid and anxious.

Correlations of mental disorders with drug use include cannabis, alcohol, and caffeine. At more than 300 mg, caffeine may cause anxiety or worsen anxiety disorders. Illicit drugs can stimulate particular parts of the brain that can affect development in adolescence. Cannabis has also been found to worsen depression and lessen an individual&#x27;s motivation. Alcohol has the potential to damage &quot;white matter&quot; in the brain that affects thinking and memory. Alcohol is a problem in many countries due to many people participating in excessive drinking or binge drinking.

==Environmental factors==
The term &quot;environment&quot; is very loosely defined in the context of mental illnesses. Unlike biological and psychological causes, environmental causes denote a wide range of stressors that individuals experience in everyday life. They are more psychologically than biologically based. Events that evoke feelings of loss are the most likely to cause a mental disorder to develop in an individual. 

Environmental factors include but are not limited to dysfunctional home life, poor interpersonal relationships, substance abuse, not meeting social expectations, low self-esteem, and poverty. The British charity organisation Mind lists childhood abuse, trauma, violence, neglect, social isolation, discrimination, grief, stress, homelessness, social disadvantage, debt, unemployment, caring for a family member or friend, and significant trauma as an adult (such as war, an accident, or being the victim of a violent crime) as possible triggers of an episode of mental illness.

Repeating generational patterns, behaviors that are passed down through different familial generations, are also a risk factor for mental illness, especially in children.

===Life events and emotional stress===
Mistreatment in childhood or adulthood (including sexual-, physical-, and emotional abuse, domestic violence, and bullying) has been linked to the onset of mental disorders through an interaction of societal, familial, psychological, and biological factors. More generally, negative or stressful life events have been implicated in the development of a range of disorders, including mood and anxiety disorders.

The main risks appear to be from the accumulation of such experiences over time, although a single major trauma can sometimes lead to disorders, especially post-traumatic stress disorder. Resilience to such experiences varies; a person may be resistant to some stressors but not to others. The psychological resilience of an individual can be affected by genetics, temperamental characteristics, cognitive flexibility, coping strategies, and previous experiences. For example, in the case of bipolar disorder, stress is not a specific cause but does place genetically and biologically vulnerable people at risk for more severe forms of the illness.

===Adverse childhood experiences===

The Adverse Childhood Experiences Study has shown a strong dose–response relationship between adverse childhood experiences or ACEs (such as physical and/or emotional neglect, abuse, poverty, malnutrition, and traumatic experiences) and numerous health, social, and behavioral problems including suicide attempts and the frequency of depressive episodes. Several such experiences can cause toxic stress.

ACEs may affect the structural and functional development of the brain and lead to abnormalities, and chronic trauma can disrupt immune responses and cause lasting dysregulated inflammatory response. A child&#x27;s neurological development can be disrupted when chronically exposed to stressful events, and his/her cognitive functioning and/or ability to cope with negative emotions can diminish. Over time, the child may adopt various harmful coping strategies that contribute to later mental and physical problems. Findings have been mixed, but some studies suggest that cognitive deficit is more related to neglect than other forms of adversity.

Poor parenting is a risk factor for depression and anxiety. Separation, grief in families, and other forms childhood trauma are risk factors for schizophrenia. Children are more susceptible to psychological harm from traumatic events than adults, but their reaction does vary by individual child, age, the type of event, and the length of exposure.

Neglect is a form of mistreatment in which the responsible caretakers fail to provide the necessary age-appropriate care, supervision, and protection. It is different from abuse in that it is, in this context, not intentional in causing harms. The long-term effects of neglect can be reduced physical, emotional, and mental health throughout the victim&#x27;s life.

===Familial and close relationships===
Parental divorce, death, absence, or the lack of stability appears to increase the risk of mental disorders in a child. Early social privation, and the lack of &quot;ongoing, harmonious, secure, committed&quot; relationships have been implicated in the development of mental illnesses. Continuous conflict with friends, one&#x27;s support system, and family can all increase the risk of developing a mental illness or can worsen one&#x27;s mental health. 

Divorce is a factor that affects adults as well as children. Divorcees may have emotional adjustment problems due to a loss of intimacy and social connections; however, new statistics show that the negative effects of divorce have been overstated.

===Social expectations and self-esteem===
Having both too low or too high self-esteem can be detrimental to an individual&#x27;s mental health. Low self-esteem in particular can result in aggression, self-deprecating behavior, anxiety, and other mental disorders. Being perceived as someone who does not &quot;fit in&quot; can result in bullying and other types of emotional abuse, which can lead to the victim experiencing depression, anger, and loneliness.

===Poverty===
Studies show that there is a direct correlation between poverty and mental illness: the lower the socioeconomic status of an individual, the higher the risk of mental illness. Impoverished people in England, defined as those who live in the lowest 20% income bracket, are two to three times more likely to develop mental illness than those of a higher economic class. This increased risk remains consistent for all poor individuals regardless of any in-group demographic differences, as all disadvantaged families experience economic stressors such as unemployment or lack of housing. A lower or more insecure educational, occupational, economic, or social position is generally linked to more mental disorders. Children from these backgrounds may have low levels of self-efficiency and self-worth. Studies have also shown a strong relationship between poverty and substance abuse, another risk factor in the onset of mental disorders.

Problems in one&#x27;s community or culture including poverty, unemployment or underemployment, a lack of social cohesion, and migration have been associated with the development of mental disorders. Personal resources, community factors, and interactions between individual and regional-level income levels have been implicated. Socioeconomic deprivation in neighborhoods can cause worsen mental health, even after accounting for genetic factors. According to a 2009 meta-analysis by Paul and Moser, countries with high income inequality and poor unemployment protections have worse mental health outcomes among the unemployed.

The effects of different socioeconomic factors varies by country. Minority ethnic groups, including first or second-generation immigrants, are at a greater risk of developing mental disorders. This has been attributed to the insecurities in their lives and their disadvantages, including racism. There have been alternate models, such as the drift hypothesis to account for the complex relationship between an individual&#x27;s social status and mental health.

==Psychological and individual factors, including resilience==
Some clinicians believe that psychological characteristics alone determine mental disorders. Others speculate that abnormal behavior can be explained by a mix of social and psychological factors. In many examples, environmental and psychological triggers complement one another resulting in emotional stress, which in turn activates a mental illness. Each person is unique in how they will react to psychological stressors. What may break one person may have little to no effect on another. Psychological stressors, which can trigger mental illness, are as follows: emotional, physical, or sexual abuse, loss of a significant loved one, neglect, and being unable to relate to others.

The inability to relate to others is also known as emotional detachment. Emotional detachment makes it difficult for an individual to empathize with others or to share their feelings. These individuals tend to stress the importance of their independence and tend to struggle relating to others. An emotionally detached person may try to rationalize or apply logic to a situation to which there is no logical explanation. Often, the inability to relate to others stems from a traumatic event.

Mental characteristics of individuals, as assessed by both neurological and psychological studies, have been linked to the development and maintenance of mental disorders. This includes cognitive or neurocognitive factors, such as the way a person perceives, thinks, or feels about certain things; or an individual&#x27;s overall personality, temperament, or coping style or the extent of protective factors or &quot;positive illusions&quot; such as optimism, personal control and a sense of meaning.

<text>Robert William Fisk (12 July 194630 October 2020) was an English writer and journalist. He was critical of United States foreign policy in the Middle East, and the Israeli government&#x27;s treatment of Palestinians.

As an international correspondent, he covered the civil wars in Lebanon, Algeria, and Syria, the Iran–Iraq conflict, the wars in Bosnia and Kosovo, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the Islamic revolution in Iran, Saddam Hussein&#x27;s invasion of Kuwait, and the U.S. invasion, and occupation of Iraq. An Arabic speaker, he was among the few Western journalists to interview Osama bin Laden, which he did three times between 1993 and 1997.

He began his journalistic career at the &quot;Newcastle Chronicle&quot; and then the &quot;Sunday Express&quot;. From there, he went to work for &quot;The Times&quot; as a correspondent in Northern Ireland, Portugal and the Middle East; in the last role, he based himself in Beirut intermittently from 1976. After 1989, he worked for &quot;The Independent&quot;. Fisk received many British and international journalism awards, including the Press Awards Foreign Reporter of the Year seven times.

Books by Fisk include &quot;The Point of No Return&quot; (1975), &quot;In Time of War&quot; (1985), &quot;Pity the Nation: Lebanon at War&quot; (1990), &quot;The Great War for Civilisation: The Conquest of the Middle East&quot; (2005), and &quot;Syria: Descent Into the Abyss&quot; (2015).

The term  (meaning a line-by-line rebuttal) was named after him.

==Early life and education==
Fisk was an only child, born in Maidstone, Kent, to William and Peggy Fisk. His father was Borough Treasurer at Maidstone Corporation and had fought in the First World War. His mother was an amateur painter who in later years became a Maidstone magistrate. At the end of the war Bill Fisk was punished for disobeying an order to execute another soldier; his son said, &quot;My father&#x27;s refusal to kill another man was the only thing he did in his life which I would also have done.&quot; Though his father said little about his part in the war, it held a fascination for his son. After his father&#x27;s death, he discovered that he had been the scribe of his battalion&#x27;s war diaries from August 1918.

Fisk was educated at Yardley Court, a preparatory school, then at Sutton Valence School and Lancaster University, where he undertook his B.A. in Latin and Linguistics and contributed to the student magazine &quot;John O&#x27;Gauntlet&quot;. He gained a PhD in political science from Trinity College Dublin in 1983; the title of his doctoral thesis was &quot;A Condition of Limited Warfare: Éire&#x27;s Neutrality and the Relationship between Dublin, Belfast and London, 1939–1945&quot;. It was published as &quot;In Time of War: Ireland, Ulster and the Price of Neutrality 1939-1945&quot; (London: André Deutsch, 1983; reprinted in Dublin by Gill &amp; MacMillan, 1996). Reviewer F. I. Magee in 1984 stated: &quot;This book presents a detailed and definitive account of Anglo-Irish relations during the Second World War...Fisk&#x27;s excellent book highlights the ambivalence in relations between Britain, the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland and goes a long way towards explaining why the current situation is so intractable.&quot;

==Career==
===Newspaper correspondent ===
Fisk worked on the &quot;Sunday Express&quot; diary column before a disagreement with the editor, John Junor, prompted a move to &quot;The Times&quot;. From 1972 to 1975, at the height of the Troubles, Fisk was &quot;The Times&quot;″ Belfast correspondent, before being posted to Portugal following the Carnation Revolution in 1974. He then was appointed Middle East correspondent (1976–1987). In addition to the Troubles and Portugal, he reported the Iranian revolution in 1979. When a story of his on Iran Air Flight 655 was spiked shortly after the paper&#x27;s takeover by Rupert Murdoch, Fisk moved to &quot;The Independent&quot; in 1989. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Fisk as &quot;probably the most famous foreign correspondent in Britain&quot;. &quot;The Economist&quot; referred to him as &quot;one of the most influential correspondents in the Middle East since the second world war.&quot;

===War reporting===

Fisk lived in Beirut from 1976, remaining throughout the Lebanese Civil War. He was one of the first Western journalists to report on the Sabra and Shatila massacre in Lebanon, as well as the Hama Massacre in Syria. His book on the Lebanese conflict, &quot;Pity the Nation: Lebanon at War&quot;, was published in 1990.

Fisk also reported on the Soviet–Afghan War, the Iran–Iraq War, the Arab–Israeli conflict, the Gulf War, the Kosovo War, the Algerian Civil War, the Bosnian War, the 2001 international intervention in Afghanistan, the invasion of Iraq in 2003, the Arab Spring in 2011 and the ongoing Syrian Civil War. During the Iran–Iraq War, he suffered partial but permanent hearing loss as a result of being close to Iraqi heavy artillery in the Shatt-al-Arab when covering the early stages of the conflict.

After the United States and allies launched their intervention in Afghanistan, Fisk was for a time transferred to Pakistan to cover the conflict. While reporting from there, he was attacked and beaten by a group of Afghan refugees fleeing heavy bombing by the United States Air Force. In his graphic account of his almost being beaten to death until a local Muslim leader intervened, Fisk absolved the attackers of responsibility and pointed out that their &quot;brutality was entirely the product of others, of us—of we who had armed their struggle against the Russians and ignored their pain and laughed at their civil war and then armed and paid them again for the &#x27;War for Civilisation&#x27; just a few miles away and then bombed their homes and ripped up their families and called them &#x27;collateral damage&#x27;.&quot; According to Richard Falk, Fisk said of his attacker: &quot;There is every reason to be angry. I&#x27;ve been an outspoken critic of the US actions myself. If I had been them, I would have attacked me.&quot;

During the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Fisk was based in Baghdad and filed many eyewitness reports. He criticised other journalists based in Iraq for what he calls their &quot;hotel journalism&quot;: reporting from one&#x27;s hotel room without interviews or first-hand experience of events. Fisk&#x27;s criticism of the invasion was rejected by some other journalists. Fisk criticised the Coalition&#x27;s handling of the sectarian violence in post-invasion Iraq and argued that the official narrative of sectarian conflict is not possible: &quot;The real question I ask myself is: who are these people who are trying to provoke the civil war? Now the Americans will say it&#x27;s Al Qaeda, it&#x27;s the Sunni insurgents. It is the death squads. Many of the death squads work for the Ministry of Interior. Who runs the Ministry of Interior in Baghdad? Who pays the Ministry of the Interior? Who pays the militiamen who make up the death squads? We do, the occupation authorities. ... We need to look at this story in a different light.&quot;

===Osama bin Laden===
Fisk interviewed Osama bin Laden on three occasions. The interviews appeared in articles published by &quot;The Independent&quot; on 6 December 1993, 10 July 1996 and 22 March 1997. In Fisk&#x27;s first interview, &quot;Anti-Soviet warrior puts his army on the road to peace&quot;, he wrote of Osama bin Laden, then overseeing the construction of a highway in Sudan: &quot;With his high cheekbones, narrow eyes and long brown robe, Mr Bin Laden looks every inch the mountain warrior of mujahedin legend. Chadored children danced in front of him, preachers acknowledged his wisdom&quot; while observing that he was accused of &quot;training for further jihad wars&quot;.

During one of Fisk&#x27;s interviews with bin Laden, Fisk noted an attempt by bin Laden to convert him. Bin Laden said: &quot;Mr Robert, one of our brothers had a dream ... that you were a spiritual person ... this means you are a true Muslim&quot;. Fisk replied: &quot;Sheikh Osama, I am not a Muslim. ... I am a journalist [whose] task is to tell the truth.&quot; Bin Laden replied: &quot;If you tell the truth, that means you are a good Muslim.&quot; During the 1996 interview, bin Laden said the Saudi royal family was corrupt. During the final interview in 1997, bin Laden said he sought God&#x27;s help &quot;to turn America into a shadow of itself&quot;.

Fisk strongly condemned the September 11 attacks, describing them as a &quot;hideous crime against humanity&quot;. He also denounced the Bush administration&#x27;s response to the attacks, arguing that &quot;a score of nations&quot; were being identified and positioned as &quot;haters of democracy&quot; or &quot;kernels of evil&quot;, and urged a more honest debate on U.S. policy in the Middle East. He argued that such a debate had hitherto been avoided &quot;because, of course, to look too closely at the Middle East would raise disturbing questions about the region, about our Western policies in those tragic lands, and about America&#x27;s relationship with Israel&quot;.

In 2007, Fisk expressed personal doubts about the official historical record of the attacks. In an article for &quot;The Independent&quot;, he wrote that, while the Bush administration was incapable of successfully carrying out such attacks due to its organisational incompetence, he was &quot;increasingly troubled at the inconsistencies in the official narrative of 9/11&quot; and added that he did not condone the &quot;crazed &#x27;research&#x27; of David Icke&quot;, but was &quot;talking about scientific issues&quot;. Fisk had earlier addressed similar concerns in a speech at Sydney University in 2006. During the speech, Fisk said: &quot;Partly I think because of the culture of secrecy of the White House, never have we had a White House so secret as this one. Partly because of this culture, I think suspicions are growing in the United States, not just among Berkeley guys with flowers in their hair. ... But there are a lot of things we don&#x27;t know, a lot of things we&#x27;re not going to be told. ... Perhaps the [fourth] plane was hit by a missile, we still don&#x27;t know&quot;.

Bill Durodié noted that at one point Osama bin Laden had advised the White House to &quot;read Robert Fisk, rather than, as one might have supposed, the Koran.&quot;

===Syrian Civil War===
Reporting from Douma, in April 2018 on the Douma chemical attack, Fisk quoted a Syrian doctor who attributed the victims&#x27; breathing problems not to gas but to dust and lack of oxygen after heavy shelling by government forces. Other people he spoke to doubted a gas attack, and Fisk queried the incident. Fisk&#x27;s reporting drew criticism for having relied on government supplied contacts, with Asser Khattab writing in &quot;Raseef22&quot; that the doctor quoted by Fisk &quot;had been introduced to him by officials in the Syrian government and army&quot;. Richard Spencer and Catherine Philp in &quot;The Times&quot; wrote that journalists had been taken to Douma on a government-organised trip while international investigators were forced to remain in Damascus, and that the doctor interviewed by Fisk admitted to not having been to the hospital where the victims were taken. The Snopes website said other reporters on the same trip as Fisk had interviewed locals who said they had inhaled toxic gas.

Fisk returned to the subject of the Douma attacks in early January 2020, in an article concerning internal disagreements within the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) recorded in documents released by WikiLeaks.

=== Media appearances ===
He was interviewed by Kirsty Young for &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; in 2006. His final selections were &quot;Adagio for Strings&quot; by Samuel Barber, &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; by Thomas Malory, and a violin.

Fisk featured in the 2016 documentary film &quot;notes to eternity&quot; by New Zealand filmmaker Sarah Cordery, along with Noam Chomsky, Norman Finkelstein and Sara Roy. The film explores their lives and work in relation to the Israel-Palestine conflict.

Fisk was profiled in Yung Chang&#x27;s 2019 documentary film &quot;This Is Not a Movie&quot;. In reviewing the film, &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; stated: &quot;The two things that give this documentary its power and provocativeness are intellectual rather than dramatic: Fisk’s work, and his ideas.&quot; Cath Clarke, writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, said the film asks its audience about war: &quot;Is there something deep in our souls that permits it because it feels natural? His painful, deeply serious question about the inevitability of war sets the tone of this documentary about his career.&quot;

==Views==
===Stances and reception===
Fisk was known for his criticism of the foreign policy of the United States, particularly the country&#x27;s involvement in the wars in Afghanistan and the Middle East. He was consistently critical of Israel, labelling some of the country&#x27;s actions against Palestinians as &quot;war crimes&quot;. One of his beliefs was that he should report events from the point of view of the victim rather than those in authority. &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper, in its November 2020 obituary of Fisk, said that he had developed a &quot;visceral dislike of the Israeli government and its allies&quot; following his coverage of the Sabra and Shatila massacre, arguing that this had made Fisk biased and &quot;unable to provide a dispassionate account of events and their context&quot;. David Pryce-Jones, writing in &quot;The Spectator&quot; in 2003, said that Fisk was guilty of &quot;hysteria and distortion&quot; in his coverage of Middle Eastern topics. In contrast, &quot;The Independent&quot;, for whom he wrote from 1989, praised him as being &quot;renowned for his courage in questioning official narratives from governments&quot;.

The BBC&#x27;s Jeremy Bowen also praised him following his death, and noted the controversy Fisk drew for his &quot;sharp criticism of the US and Israel, and of Western foreign policy&quot;. Bowen described himself as an admirer who would miss Fisk&#x27;s &quot;guts and his appetite for the fight&quot;. Fisk dismissed the controversy related to his reporting in Syria, saying that he was &quot;writing only what he saw and heard&quot;. His ex-wife, Lara Marlowe, took exception to the use of the adjective &quot;controversial&quot; in his obituaries, saying &quot;he was a prolific non-conformist in the world of journalism, whose judgments avoided jumping on the bandwagon&quot; and, in her experience, had been &quot;intuitive, rapid [...] and invariably right&quot;.

Similarly, the foreign correspondent for &quot;The Independent&quot; Patrick Cockburn, responding to criticisms raised in obituaries, said &quot; in times of war usually gets good notices from the press and from public opinion, but moral endurance is a much rarer commodity, when the plaudits are replaced by abuse, often from people who see a world divided between devils and angels and denounce anybody reporting less than angelic behaviour on the part of the latter for being secret sympathisers with the devil.&quot; Cockburn wrote that Fisk was better than anyone at &quot;find[ing] out significant news as fast as possible, disregard[ing] all efforts by governments, armies and media to suppress it, and pass[ing] that information on to the public so they can better judge what is happening in the world around them&quot;.

=== On journalism and politics ===

Fisk described himself as a pacifist and non-voter. He said that journalism must &quot;challenge authority, all authority, especially so when governments and politicians take us to war&quot;. He quoted, with approval, the words of Israeli journalist Amira Hass: &quot;There is a misconception that journalists can be objective. ... What journalism is really about is to monitor power and the centres of power.&quot; In light of his earlier training as a journalist on the &quot;Newcastle Evening Chronicle&quot;, he said &quot;I had a suspicion that the language we were forced to write as trainee reporters all those years ago had somehow imprisoned us, that we had been schooled to mould the world and ourselves in clichés, that for the most part this would define our lives, destroy our anger and imagination, make us loyal to our betters, to governments, to authority. For some reason, I had become possessed of the belief that the blame for our failure as journalists to report the Middle East with any sense of moral passion or indignation lay in the way that we as journalists were trained.&quot; In an interview with the BBC in 2005, he articulated this position further: &quot;If you believe that victims should have more of a say than people who commit atrocities, then yes, I take a definite position. If reporters don&#x27;t do that then they are out of their minds.&quot;

On coverage of foreign reporting, he observed in a 2006 interview with Harry Kreisler of the Institute of International Studies at UC Berkeley: &quot;the French are very good at getting to the scene and reporting the reality. I know France doesn&#x27;t have a very clean reputation in American politics at the moment but my goodness, they&#x27;ve got good journalists. You read a translation of &quot;Libération&quot;, &quot;Figaro&quot;, &quot;Le Monde&quot; – they&#x27;ve got it. I work a lot with French – I normally work on my own, but if I work with other reporters, I tend to report with Italians or the French because, my goodness, they get to the war front.&quot;

When he spoke on &quot;Lies, Misreporting, and Catastrophe in the Middle East&quot; at the First Congregational Church of Berkeley on 22 September 2010, he stated: &quot;I think it is the duty of a foreign correspondent to be neutral and unbiased on the side of those who suffer, whoever they may be.&quot; He wrote at length on how many contemporary conflicts had their origins, in his view, in lines drawn on maps: &quot;After the Allied victory of 1918, at the end of my father&#x27;s war, the victors divided up the lands of their former enemies. In the space of just seventeen months, they created the borders of Northern Ireland, Yugoslavia and most of the Middle East. And I have spent my entire career—in Belfast and Sarajevo, in Beirut and Baghdad—watching the people within those borders burn.&quot;

===Armenian genocide===
Fisk wrote extensively about the Armenian genocide of 1915 and supported moves to persuade the Turkish Government to acknowledge it.

===Remembrance Day===

For Remembrance Day in 2011, Fisk wrote that his father &quot;old Bill Fisk became very ruminative about the Great War. He learned that Haig had lied, that he himself had fought for a world that betrayed him, that 20,000 British dead on the first day of the Somme – which he mercifully avoided because his first regiment, the Cheshires, sent him to Dublin and Cork to deal with another 1916 &quot;problem&quot; – was a trashing of human life. In hospital and recovering from cancer, I asked him once why the Great War was fought. &#x27;All I can tell you, fellah,&#x27; he said, &#x27;was that it was a great waste.&#x27; And he swept his hand from left to right. Then he stopped wearing his poppy. I asked him why, and he said that he didn&#x27;t want to see &#x27;so many damn fools&#x27; wearing it.&quot; He returned to the subject in 2014, the standfirst summarised his experience &quot;My family was haunted by my father&#x27;s experience on the Somme and the loss of his friends. Why do we pay homage to the dead but ignore the lessons of their war?&quot; and in 2016 where he said &quot;His example was one of great courage. He fought for his country and then, unafraid, he threw his poppy away. Television celebrities do not have to fight for their country – yet they do not even have the guts to break this fake conformity and toss their sordid poppies in the office waste paper bin.&quot;

==Personal life==
Fisk married American-born journalist Lara Marlowe in 1994. The couple divorced in 2006. At the time of his death, he was married to Nelofer Pazira, an Afghan-Canadian journalist, author and human rights activist.

On settling down, he wrote in 2005: &quot;I told the journalism students there [at City, University of London] that when I saw families walking happily in London or Paris, I wondered whether I had not missed out on life, that perhaps comparative safety and security with nothing more than the mortgage to worry about was preferable to the existence I had chosen for myself. A friend of my father&#x27;s once said I had enjoyed the privilege of seeing things that no other man had seen. But after a flood of questions from students in Sydney about suffering in the Middle East, I began to wonder if my privilege had not also been my curse.&quot;

==Death==
On 30 October 2020, Fisk died aged 74 at St. Vincent&#x27;s University Hospital in Dublin, Ireland, after a suspected stroke. Due to the Irish Government COVID-19 restrictions, his funeral was held privately.

The president of Ireland, Michael D. Higgins said &quot;with his passing the world of journalism and informed commentary on the Middle East has lost one of its finest commentators&quot; and the Taoiseach Micheál Martin stated that &quot;he was fearless and independent in his reporting, with a deeply researched understanding of the complexities of the Middle East, eastern history and politics&quot;.

The Australian anti-war journalist John Pilger declared upon hearing of his death that &quot;Robert Fisk has died. I pay warmest tribute to one of the last great reporters. The weasel word &#x27;controversial&#x27; appears in even his own paper, &quot;The Independent&quot;, whose pages he honoured. He went against the grain and told the truth, spectacularly. Journalism has lost the bravest.&quot; Former Leader of the UK Labour Party Jeremy Corbyn eulogised him on Twitter, finding it &quot;[s]o sad to hear of the death of Robert Fisk. A huge loss of a brilliant man with unparalleled knowledge of history, politics and people of Middle East.&quot; The Greek politician and economic theorist Yanis Varoufakis also posted a eulogy on Twitter, declaring that &quot;[w]ith Robert Fisk&#x27;s passing we have lost a journalistic eye without which we shall be partially blind, a pen without which our capacity to express the truth is diminished, a soul without which our own empathy for victims of imperialism will be lacking.&quot;

Christian Broughton, the managing director of &quot;The Independent&quot;, said &quot;Fearless, uncompromising, determined and utterly committed to uncovering the truth and reality at all costs, Robert Fisk was the greatest journalist of his generation. The fire he lit at &quot;The Independent&quot; will burn on.&quot; For Harry Browne in &quot;Jacobin&quot;: &quot;Robert Fisk&#x27;s voice was everywhere, and his ideas were vital in both creating and meeting that Irish urge for explanation.&quot; The &quot;Irish Times&quot; obituary read: &quot;He used to explain his rejection of conventional journalistic detachment by saying: &#x27;If you watch wars, the old ideas of journalism that you have to be neutral and take nobody&#x27;s side is rubbish. As a journalist, you have got to be neutral and unbiased on the side of those who suffer.&quot; Former Chartered Institute of Journalists president Liz Justice wrote: &quot;I knew him as a very detailed and knowledgeable journalist. My friend had to edit his work from 2,000 words to 400 and we have very different views involving eggshells and walking carefully. We both agree he will be missed.&quot; Richard Falk, in an interview with &quot;CounterPunch&quot;, said: &quot;Fisk&#x27;s departure from the region left a journalistic gap that has not been filled. It is important to appreciate that there are few war correspondents in the world that combine Fisk&#x27;s reporting fearlessness with his interpretative depth, engaging writing style, and candid exposures of the foibles of the high and mighty.&quot;

== Memoir ==
&quot;Love in a Time of War&quot;, a memoir by Fisk&#x27;s first wife, Lara Marlowe, was published in 2021. It covers the period from 1988 to 2003, the period Fisk and Marlowe worked together.

==Awards, honours and degrees ==
Fisk received the British Press Awards&#x27; International Journalist of the Year seven times, and twice won its &quot;Reporter of the Year&quot; award. He also received Amnesty International UK Media Awards in 1992 for his report &quot;The Other Side of the Hostage Saga&quot;, in 1998 for his reports from Algeria and again in 2000 for his articles on the NATO air campaign against the FRY in 1999.

== Works ==
===Books===
His 2005 work, &quot;The Great War for Civilisation&quot;, was critical of Western and Israeli approaches to the Middle East. Neal Ascherson, for &quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot; commented: &quot;This is a very long book, allowing Fisk to interleave political analysis, recent history and his own adventures with the real stories which concern him. These are the sufferings of ordinary people under monstrous tyrannies or in criminal, avoidable wars&quot;. In &quot;The Guardian&quot;, a former British Ambassador to Libya, Oliver Miles, complained of &quot;a deplorable number of mistakes&quot; in the book&#x27;s 1,366 pages which &quot;undermine the reader&#x27;s confidence&quot;, and that &quot;vigilant editing and ruthless pruning could perhaps have made two or three good short books out of this one&quot;. Richard Beeston, a longtime foreign correspondent and then foreign editor for &quot;The Times&quot;, wrote in a review of the book that Fisk&#x27;s &quot;central argument is lost in a verbal avalanche, as Fisk empties 30 years of notebooks onto the page&quot; and that while there are what he calls &quot;passages of descriptive brilliance&quot; he regarded some of his arguments &quot;ridiculous&quot; and &quot;utter nonsense&quot;.

===Video documentary===
Fisk produced a three-part series titled &quot;From Beirut To Bosnia&quot; in 1993 which Fisk said was an attempt &quot;to find out why an increasing number of Muslims had come to hate the West&quot;. Fisk said that the Discovery Channel did not show a repeat of the films, after initially showing them in full, due to a letter campaign launched by pro-Israel groups such as CAMERA.

<text>Sketch comedy comprises a series of short, amusing scenes or vignettes, called &quot;sketches&quot;, commonly between one and ten minutes long, performed by a group of comic actors or comedians. While the form developed and became popular in music hall in Britain and vaudeville in North America, today it is used widely in variety shows, as well as in late night talk shows and even some sitcoms. While sketch comedy is now associated mostly with adult entertainment, certain children&#x27;s television series such have used it, too. The sketches may be improvised live by the performers, developed through improvisation before public performance, or scripted and rehearsed in advance like a play. 

==History==
Sketch comedy has its origins in music hall and vaudeville, where many brief humorous acts were strung together to form a larger programme. In the 1890s, music hall impresario Fred Karno developed a form of sketch comedy without dialogue, and in 1904 he produced a sketch called &quot;Mumming Birds&quot; for the Hackney Empire in London, which included the pie in the face gag among other innovations. His troupe, advertised as &quot;Fred Karno&#x27;s London Comedians&quot;, included Charlie Chaplin and Stan Laurel.
In Britain, it moved to stage performances by Cambridge Footlights, such as &quot;Beyond the Fringe&quot; and &quot;A Clump of Plinths&quot; (which evolved into &quot;Cambridge Circus&quot;), to radio, with such shows as &quot;It&#x27;s That Man Again&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry, I&#x27;ll Read That Again&quot;, then to television, with such shows as &quot;The Benny Hill Show&quot;, &quot;Not Only... But Also&quot;, &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus,&quot; &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot;, &quot;Not the Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot; (and its successor &quot;Alas Smith and Jones&quot;), and &quot;A Bit of Fry and Laurie&quot;. Making his television debut in 1949, Benny Hill, who developed his parodic sketches on BBC variety shows before having his own show in 1955, was described as &quot;a comic genius steeped in the British music hall tradition&quot;. Charles Isherwood writes that Monty Python, like Benny Hill, &quot;derived their sketch formats in part from the rowdy tradition of the music hall.&quot;

An early, perhaps the first, televised example of a sketch comedy show is &quot;Texaco Star Theater&quot; aka &quot;The Milton Berle Show&quot; 1948–1967, hosted by Milton Berle. In Mexico, the series &quot;Los Supergenios de la Mesa Cuadrada&quot;, created by Mexican comedian Roberto Gómez Bolaños under the stage name Chespirito, was broadcast between 1968 and 1973, creating such famous characters as El Chavo del Ocho and El Chapulín Colorado.

While separate sketches historically have tended to be unrelated, more recent groups have introduced overarching themes that connect the sketches within a particular show with recurring characters that return for more than one appearance. Examples of recurring characters include Mr. Gumby from &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;; Ted and Ralph from &quot;The Fast Show&quot;; The Family from &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;; the Head Crusher from &quot;The Kids in the Hall&quot;; Martin Short&#x27;s Ed Grimley, a recurring character from both &quot;SCTV&quot; and &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;; The Nerd from &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;; and Kevin and Perry from &quot;Harry Enfield and Chums&quot;. Recurring characters from &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; have notably been featured in a number of spinoff films, including &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot; (1980), &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot; (1992) and &quot;Superstar&quot; (1999).

The idea of running characters was taken a step further with shows like &quot;The Red Green Show&quot; and &quot;The League of Gentlemen&quot;, where sketches centered on the various inhabitants of the fictional towns of Possum Lake and Royston Vasey, respectively. In &quot;Little Britain&quot;, sketches focused on a cast of recurring characters.

In North America, contemporary sketch comedy is largely an outgrowth of the improvisational comedy scene that flourished during the 1970s, largely growing out of &quot;The Second City&quot; in Chicago and Toronto, which was built upon the success in Minneapolis of The Brave New Workshop and Dudley Riggs.

Notable contemporary American stage sketch comedy groups include The Second City, the Upright Citizens Brigade, and The Groundlings. In South Bend, Indiana, area high school students produced a sketch comedy series called &quot;Beyond Our Control&quot; that aired on the local NBC affiliate WNDU-TV from 1967 to 1986.
Warner Bros. Animation made two sketch comedy shows, &quot;Mad&quot; and &quot;Right Now Kapow&quot;.

Australian television of the 1980s and 1990s featured several successful sketch comedy shows, notably &quot;The Comedy Company&quot;, whose recurring characters included Col&#x27;n Carpenter, Kylie Mole and Con the Fruiterer.

===Films===
An early British example is the influential &quot;The Running Jumping &amp; Standing Still Film&quot; (1959).
Sketch films made during the 1970s and 1980s include &quot;If You Don&#x27;t Stop It... You&#x27;ll Go Blind&quot; and the sequel &quot;Can I Do It... &#x27;Til I Need Glasses?&quot;, &quot;The Groove Tube&quot;, &quot;Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)&quot;, &quot;The Kentucky Fried Movie&quot; and its sequel &quot;Amazon Women on the Moon&quot;, and Monty Python&#x27;s &quot;And Now for Something Completely Different&quot; and &quot;The Meaning of Life&quot;.

More recent sketch films include &quot;The Underground Comedy Movie&quot;, &quot;InAPPropriate Comedy&quot;, &quot;Movie 43&quot; and &quot;Livrés chez vous sans contact&quot;.

===Festivals===
Many of the sketch comedy revues in Britain included seasons at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.

Since 1999, the growing sketch comedy scene has precipitated the development of sketch comedy festivals in cities all around North America. Noted festivals include:
*Chicago Sketch Fest
*SF Sketchfest
*Toronto Sketch Comedy Festival

<doc id="51611" wikidata="Q23103" url="?curid=51611" title="Shropshire">
<text>Shropshire (; abbreviated Salop) is a ceremonial county in the West Midlands of England, on the border with Wales. It is bordered by Cheshire to the north-east, Staffordshire to the east, Worcestershire to the south-east, Herefordshire to the south, and the Welsh principal areas of Powys and Wrexham to the west and north-west respectively. The largest settlement is Telford, while Shrewsbury is the county town.

The county has an area of and a population of 498,073. Telford in the east and Shrewsbury in the centre are the largest towns. Shropshire is otherwise rural, and contains market towns such as Oswestry in the north-west, Market Drayton in the north-east, Bridgnorth in the south-east, and Ludlow in the south. For local government purposes the county comprises two unitary authority areas: Shropshire, and Telford and Wrekin. The county historically had a large exclave around Halesowen and Oldbury, which are now in the West Midlands county.

The south-west and far west of the county are upland. The Shropshire Hills occupy most of the south-west and include the Stiperstones, Clee Hills, Long Mynd plateau, and the Wenlock Edge escarpment. Together with the Wrekin, which stands isolated to the west of Telford, they have been designated a national landscape. To their west is the upland Clun Forest, and in the far north-west of the county are the Oswestry uplands. The north of the county is a plain, and the far north contains Wixall Moss, part of a national nature reserve. The south-east is a sandstone plateau which forms part of the catchment of the Severn, the county&#x27;s major river; it enters Shropshire in the west and flows through Shrewsbury before turning south-east and exiting into Worcestershire south of Bridgnorth.

There is evidence of Neolithic and Bronze Age human occupation in Shropshire, including the Shropshire bulla pendant. The hillfort at Old Oswestry dates from the Iron Age, and the remains of the city of Viroconium Cornoviorum date from the Roman period. During the Anglo-Saxon era the area was part of Mercia. During the High Middle Ages the county was part of the Welsh Marches, the border region between Wales and England; from 1472 to 1689 Ludlow was the seat of the Council of Wales and the Marches, which administered justice in Wales and Herefordshire, Shropshire, Worcestershire and Gloucestershire. During the English Civil War Shropshire was Royalist, and Charles II fled through the county—famously hiding in an oak tree—after his final defeat at the Battle of Worcester. The area around Coalbrookdale is regarded as one of the birthplaces of the Industrial Revolution and has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

==History==
=== Prehistory and antiquity ===
Evidence of Neolithic occupation of a religious form dating back before 2,000 BC, was discovered in 2017 in the grounds of a church, the medieval Church of the Holy Fathers in Sutton, Shrewsbury, making it Britain&#x27;s oldest place of worship.

The Shropshire bulla (&quot;bulla&quot; is Medieval Latin for &quot;a round seal&quot;, Classical Latin for &quot;bubble, blob&quot;, plural bullae), also known as the Shropshire sun pendant, is a Late Bronze Age gold pendant found by a metal detectorist in 2018 in Shropshire. At Mitchel&#x27;s Fold there is a Bronze Age stone circle set in dramatic moorland on Stapeley Hill.


The area was once part of the lands of the Cornovii, which consisted of the modern day counties of Cheshire, Shropshire, north Staffordshire, north Herefordshire, and eastern parts of Powys. This was a tribal Celtic Iron Age kingdom. Their capital in pre-Roman times was probably a hill fort on the Wrekin. There is an important Iron Age Hill fort at Old Oswestry earthworks, this has been linked to where King Arthur’s Guinevere was born and called &quot;the Stonehenge of the Iron Age.&quot;

According to tradition, Caracticus made his last stand against the Romans in Shropshire. Ptolemy&#x27;s 2nd century &quot;Geography&quot; names one of their towns as being Viroconium Cornoviorum (Wroxeter), which became their capital under Roman rule and one of the largest settlements in Britain.
=== Middle Ages ===

==== Early period ====
After the Roman occupation of Britain ended in the 5th century, the Shropshire area was in the eastern part of the Welsh Kingdom of Powys; known in Welsh poetry as the &quot;Paradise of Powys&quot;.

As &#x27;Caer Guricon&#x27; it is a possible Shrewsbury was the site of the seat of the Kingdom of Powys in the Early Middle Ages. This would date establishment of the town to the 500s CE under Brochwel Ysgithrog. It is believed the area of Shrewsbury was settled in the 5th century by refugees from the nearby Roman City of Viroconium Cornoviorum, most physical evidence dates from the 7th century.

Oswestry saw conflict in the early mediaeval period and is reputed to be the place of death of Oswald of Northumbria in 641 or 642 CE. Oswald was later regarded as a saint, with Bede saying that the spot where he died came to be associated with miracles, and people took dirt from the site, which led to a hole being dug as deep as a man&#x27;s height.

King Offa of Mercia annexed the entirety of Shropshire over the course of the 8th century from Powys, with Shrewsbury captured in 778, with two dykes built to defend, or at least demarcate it from the Welsh. King Offa converted the palace of the rulers of Powys into his first church, dedicated to St Chad (a foundation that still survives in the town and operated on that initial site for over 1000 years, moving in 1792).

In later centuries, Vikings repeatedly invaded and fortresses were built at Bridgnorth (912) and Chirbury (913).

In 914, Æthelflæd, Lady of the Mercians, fortified Shrewsbury, along with two other fortresses, at &quot;Scergeat&quot; (a currently unknown location) and &quot;Weardbyrig&quot;, Viking rides from the north traveling south were reaching Bridgnorth at this time (910CE). In the early tenth century, the relics of St Alkmund were translated to Whitchurch, this was also probably the work of Æthelflæd.

There is evidence to show that by the beginning of the 900s, Shrewsbury was home to a mint.

Archaeological excavations at the site of Shrewsbury castle in 2019 have indicated that the castle itself may have been a fortified site in the time of the Saxons.

==== High medieval period ====
After the Norman conquest in 1066, major estates in Shropshire were granted to Normans, including Roger de Montgomerie and later his son Robert de Bellême, who ordered significant constructions, particularly in Shrewsbury, the town of which he was Earl.

Many defensive castles were built at this time across the county to defend against the Welsh and enable effective control of the region, including Ludlow Castle and Shrewsbury Castle.

The western frontier with Wales was not finally determined until the 14th century. Also in this period, a number of religious foundations were formed, the county largely falling at this time under the Diocese of Hereford and that of Coventry and Lichfield. Some parishes in the north-west of the county in later times fell under the Diocese of St. Asaph until the disestablishment of the Church in Wales in 1920, when they were ceded to the Lichfield diocese.

The county was a central part of the Welsh Marches during the medieval period and was often embroiled in the power struggles between powerful Marcher Lords, the Earls of March and successive monarchs.

=== Modern history ===
From 1457, King Henry VI created for his son, Prince Edward, a Council to rule Wales and the Marches, Cheshire, and Cornwall, which became the Council of the Marches. Shropshire was governed via this council for several centuries.

According to historian John Davies, at its peak under Sir Henry Sidney and for a period thereafter the Council:

represented a remarkable experiment in regional government. It administered the law cheaply and rapidly; it dealt with up to twenty cases a day and George Owen stated that the &#x27;oppressed poor&#x27; flocked to it.

==== Civil War ====

During the English Civil War, Shropshire was a Royalist stronghold, under the command of Sir Francis Ottley. In the autumn of 1642, Charles I had a temporary capital at Shrewsbury, though he immediately moved to Oxford after the events of the Battle of Wem. Prince Rupert established his headquarters in the town on 18 February 1644, being welcomed by Shrewsbury&#x27;s aldermen.

===Victorian era===
Much Wenlock was the birthplace of the modern Olympic movement.

== Culture and cultural references ==
=== Literature and legends ===
In the High Medieval period the Shropshire area influenced important poetry: the poet William Langland, writer of Piers Plowman, was born in Cleobury Mortimer, and the 14th-century alliterative poem St Erkenwald is written in a local dialect. The only copy of the ancient poem &#x27;Life and Death&#x27; was also found in Shropshire.

In this period the county was also associated in divers places and ways with Arthurian legends, for instance at Hawkstone, where there is a legend that one of the caves of Hawkstone Park was the burial ground of King Arthur, and the Arthurian story of the giants Tarquin and Tarquinus is located, or Whittington Castle and linked to the Holy Grail since the 13th century. Old Oswestry has been identified as a possible home of Guinevere. Ludlow Castle site features heavily in the folk-story of Fulk FitzWarin, outlawed Lord of Whittington, Shropshire and a possible inspiration for the &quot;Robin Hood&quot; legend.

Parts of Shropshire are inside the ancient Forest of Arden, which was the part if the English Midlands, that in antiquity and into the Early Modern Period was bounded by the Roman roads including to the North by the Watling Street and to the west by Wales. This forest was the Setting of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;As You Like It,&quot; and that play is acknowledged to potentially be a cultural monument to Sir Rowland Hill, a prominent Tudor statesman and publisher of the Geneva Bible from the county.

Shropshire was the original seat of prominence of the Cotton family who held the Cotton Library before it was taken to found the British Library.

Shrewsbury Abbey features in &quot;The Cadfael Chronicles&quot;; Brother Cadfael is a member of the community at the Abbey.

The poet A. E. Housman used Shropshire as the setting for many of the poems in his first book, &quot;A Shropshire Lad&quot;. Moreover, many of Malcolm Saville&#x27;s children&#x27;s books are set in Shropshire. Additionally, D. H. Lawrence&#x27;s novella, &quot;St. Mawr&quot;, is partially set in the Stiperstones area of South Shropshire.

The early 20th century novelist and poet Mary Webb was born in Shropshire and lived most of her life there, and all her novels are set there, most notably &quot;Precious Bane&quot;, with its powerful evocation of the Shropshire countryside. A school in Pontesbury bears her name.

Shropshire is widely believed to have been an influence for J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s landscape of the Shire in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Specifically, the Wrekin (as The Lonely Mountain) and Ellesmere (as Laketown) are said to have inspired the English fantasy writer.

In Susanna Clarke&#x27;s &quot;Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell&quot; (2004), Jonathan Strange is from the county, and some parts of the book are set there. Another fictional character from Shropshire is Mr Grindley, from Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;Bleak House&quot;.

P. G. Wodehouse&#x27;s fictional Blandings Castle, the ancestral home of Lord Emsworth, is located in Shropshire. Also from Shropshire is Psmith, a fictional character in a series of Wodehouse&#x27;s novels.

In Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot;, Algernon attempts to trick Jack into revealing the location of his country home by inferring he resides in Shropshire.

The 1856 plantation literature novel &quot;White Acre vs. Black Acre&quot; by William M. Burwell features two Shropshire farms acting as an allegory for American slavery – &quot;White Acre Farm&quot; being the abolitionist Northern United States, and &quot;Black Acre Farm&quot; being the slaveholding Southern United States.

The angel Aziraphale, a principal character in &quot;Good Omens&quot;, was credited with designing Shropshire by Terry Pratchett.

In the novel &quot;Howards End&quot;, Mr. Wilcox&#x27;s daughter gets married in Shropshire. Part of the novel is set near Clun.

=== Theology ===

Shropshire was the native county and rural seat of power of Sir Rowland Hill, who coordinated and published the 1560 Geneva Bible. This important Bible was the senior Bible of English Protestantism for the early decades of the Elizabethan Religious Settlement.

=== Drama ===
Prior to the Reformation, there are accounts of major festivals in the county. The &quot;first flowerings of English drama&quot; in the Tudor period are considered to be in the town, according to the 18th century Poet laureate and scholar Thomas Warton. Whitsuntide and mystery plays were performed in the founding years of Shrewsbury School under Thomas Ashton; they attracted the attention of Queen Elizabeth I. Later this was expressed in the many arbours built in Shrewsbury for that town&#x27;s particular tradition of pageantry and performance.

==== Shakespeare ====
Shakespeare memorialised the Battle of Shrewsbury in &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot;, in Acts IV (Scenes and 3) and V (Scenes 1-5). The arrest of Buckingham referred to in &quot;Richard III&quot; ( Act IV, scene iv) happened near Wem. Ludlow castle is also referred to in the same play (Act II, scene ii). There is a tradition that the Stanley monuments in St Bartholomew&#x27;s Church, Tong are the work of Shakespeare.

==== Other playwrights ====
William Wycherley was born at Clive near Shrewsbury, although his birthplace has been said to be Trench Farm to the north near Wem later the birthplace of another writer, John Ireland, who was said to have been adopted by Wycherley&#x27;s widow following the death of Ireland&#x27;s parents.

The playwright George Farquhar&#x27;s 1706 play &quot;The Recruiting Officer&quot; is set in Shrewsbury.

=== Birthplace of English ballet and pantomime ===

The &quot;father of English ballet&quot;, as well as the originator of pantomime, John Weaver, developed his art in Shrewsbury. A second generation dancing master in the town, he founded English ballet, founded pantomime, and wrote on the philosophy, theology, statecraft and biology embedded in his era&#x27;s understating of dance. Later in life he came to publish on the subject of dance, which he located in a wider understanding of his culture as representing a component of Ptolemaic harmony and an earnest part of the statecraft of his time.

=== Architecture ===

The first known architectural project of Inigo Jones is the Cotton monument in the Church of St Chad, Norton-in-Hales.

There are a number of important buildings in the county. The world&#x27;s first iron-framed building was built in Shrewsbury at the Flaxmill Maltings: the techniques pioneered in that building were necessary preconditions for skyscrapers.

Nash and Repton were active at Attingham Park.

A rare Anglo-Saxon hall, which was a high status building from the Anglo Saxon period, and possibly a feasting hall or palace, was excavated at nearby Attingham in 2018; the dating window is between 400 AD and 1066.

=== Film and television ===
The landscape around Hawkstone Park was used to represent parts of Narnia in the BBC&#x27;s TV adaptation of C. S. Lewis&#x27;s books in &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; in 1988 and &quot;Prince Caspian&quot; a year later.

The 1984 film version of Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; was filmed in Shrewsbury. The 2005 sitcom &quot;The Green Green Grass&quot; is set in Shropshire and was filmed near Ludlow.

The 2007 film &quot;Atonement&quot; was partly filmed in the county.

The 2023 BBC adaptation of &quot;Bleak House&quot; was filmed partly in Shropshire.

==Emblems==
===Coat of arms===
The blazon for the coat of arms of the county of Shropshire is:erminois, three pile azure, two issuant from the chief and one in base, each charged with a leopard&#x27;s face The arms were officially granted on 18 June 1896 and continued by the new authority in 2009.

The heads are often referred to as &quot;the loggerheads&quot;. This is thought to originate from the practice of carving a leopard head as a motif on the head of the log used as a battering ram.

===Flag===

The Shropshire county flag is a banner of arms taken from its coat of arms. It was registered with the Flag Institute in March 2012. It shows three leopard heads (&#x27;loggerheads&#x27;) on a gold and blue background.

===County flower===
In a national poll in 2002, conducted by Plantlife International, the round-leaved sundew (&quot;Drosera rotundifolia&quot;) was chosen as Shropshire&#x27;s county flower. The round-leaved sundew is a crimson-coloured insectivorous plant that requires a boggy habitat. Due to habitat loss its range is now dramatically reduced, and Shropshire&#x27;s Longmynd is one of the few areas in England where it can now be found.

===Shropshire Day===
Shropshire&#x27;s county day is on 23 February, the feast day of St Milburga, abbess of Wenlock Priory. St Milburga was the daughter of Anglo-Saxon king Merewalh, who founded the abbey within his sub-kingdom of Magonsæte. The town adjoining the priory is now known as Much Wenlock, and lies within the boundaries of the modern county of Shropshire.

===Motto===
Shropshire&#x27;s motto is &quot;Floreat Salopia&quot;, meaning &quot;May Shropshire flourish&quot;.

British Rail loco No.31147 was named &#x27;Floreat Salopia&#x27;,

== Etymology ==
Shropshire is first recorded in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; annal for 1006.

The origin of the name is the Old English &quot;Scrobbesbyrigscīr&quot;, meaning &quot;Shrewsburyshire&quot;, &quot;the shire of the fortified place in the scrublands&quot; (or &quot;shrubs&quot;, the modern derivative). Salop is an old name for Shropshire, historically used as an abbreviated form for post or telegrams; it is thought to derive from the Anglo-French &quot;Salopesberia&quot;.

It is nowadays normally replaced by Shrops, although Shropshire residents are still referred to as Salopians.

Salop is also an alternative name for the county town, Shrewsbury, which shares the motto &quot;Floreat Salopia&quot;.

==Geography==
When a county council for the county was first established in 1889, it was called Salop County Council. Following the Local Government Act 1972, Salop became the official name of the county. The name was not well-regarded locally, and a subsequent campaign led by a local councillor, John Kenyon, succeeded in having both the county and council renamed as Shropshire in 1980. This took effect from 1 April of that year.

=== County extent ===
The border with Wales was defined in the 16th century – the hundreds of Oswestry (including Oswestry town) and Pimhill (including Wem) and part of Chirbury had prior to the Laws in Wales Act formed various Lordships in the Welsh Marches.

The present day ceremonial county boundary is almost the same as the historic one. Notably there has been the removal of several exclaves and enclaves. The largest of the exclaves was Halesowen, which became part of Worcestershire in 1844 (and is now part of the West Midlands county), and the largest of the enclaves was Herefordshire&#x27;s Farlow in South Shropshire, also transferred in 1844, to Shropshire. Alterations have been made on Shropshire&#x27;s border with all neighbouring English counties over the centuries. Gains have been made to the south of Ludlow (from Herefordshire), to the north of Shifnal (from Staffordshire) and to the north (from Cheshire) and south (from Staffordshire) of Market Drayton. The county has lost land in two places – to Staffordshire and Worcestershire.

Geographically, Shropshire is divisible into two distinct halves – north and south. The county has a highly diverse geology. The West Midlands Green Belt extends into eastern Shropshire, covering an area north from Highley, to the east of Bridgnorth, north to the eastern side of Telford, leaving Shropshire eastwards alongside the A5. This encompasses Shifnal, Cosford and Albrighton, and various other villages paralleling Dudley and Wolverhampton.

===North Shropshire===
The North Shropshire Plain is an extension of the flat and fertile Cheshire Plain. It is here that most of the county&#x27;s large towns, and population, are to be found. Shrewsbury at the centre, Oswestry to the north west, Whitchurch to the north, Market Drayton to the north east, and Newport and the Telford conurbation (Telford, Wellington, Oakengates, Donnington and Shifnal) to the east. The land is fertile and agriculture remains a major feature of the landscape and the economy. The River Severn runs through the lower half of this area (from Wales in the west, eastwards), through Shrewsbury and down the Ironbridge Gorge, before heading south to Bridgnorth.

The area around Oswestry has more rugged geography than the North Shropshire Plain and the western half is over an extension of the Wrexham Coalfield and there are also copper deposits on the border with Wales. Mining of stone and sand aggregates is still going on in Mid-Shropshire, notably on Haughmond Hill, near Bayston Hill, and around the village of Condover. Lead mining also took place at Snailbeach and the Stiperstones, but this has now ceased. Other primary industries, such as forestry and fishing, are to be found too.

The A5 and M54 run from Wolverhampton (to the east of the county) across to Telford, around Shrewsbury parallel to the line of Watling Street, an ancient trackway. The A5 then turns north west to Oswestry, before heading north into Wales in the Wrexham area. This is an important artery and the corridor is where most of Shropshire&#x27;s modern commerce and industry is found, notably in Telford new town. There are also a number of railway lines crossing over the area, which centre at Shrewsbury. To the south west of Telford, near the Ironbridge Gorge, was Ironbridge Power Station.

The new town of Telford is built partly on a former industrial area centred on the East Shropshire Coalfield as well as on former agricultural land. There are still many ex-colliery sites to be found in the area, as well as disused mine shafts. This industrial heritage is an important tourist attraction, as is seen by the growth of museums in the Ironbridge, Coalbrookdale, Broseley and Jackfield area. Blists Hill museum and historical (Victorian era) village is a major tourist attraction as well as the Iron Bridge itself. In addition, Telford Steam Railway runs from Horsehay.

===South Shropshire===


South Shropshire is more rural, with fewer settlements and no large towns, and its landscape differs greatly from that of North Shropshire. The area is dominated by significant hill ranges and river valleys, woods, pine forests and &quot;batches&quot;, a colloquial term for small valleys. Farming is more pastoral than the arable found in the north of the county. The only substantial towns are Bridgnorth, with a population of around 12,000 people, Ludlow and Church Stretton. The Shropshire Hills AONB is located in the south-west, covering an area of ; it forms the only specifically protected area of the county. Inside this area is the popular Long Mynd, a large plateau of overlooking Church Stretton and to its west, the rocky ridge of Stiperstones.

The A49 is the main road through the area, running north to south, from Shrewsbury to Herefordshire. A railway line runs through the area on the same route as the A49 with stations at Church Stretton, Craven Arms and Ludlow. The steam heritage Severn Valley Railway runs from Bridgnorth into Worcestershire along the Severn Valley, terminating at Kidderminster.

Because of its valley location and character, Church Stretton is sometimes called Little Switzerland, and is depicted in &quot;Little Switzerland&quot;. Nearby are the old mining and quarrying communities on the Clee Hills, notable geological features in the Onny Valley and Wenlock Edge and fertile farmland in Corve Dale. The River Teme drains this part of the county, before flowing into Worcestershire to the south and joining the River Severn.

One of the Clee Hills, the Brown Clee Hill, is the county&#x27;s highest peak at . It is the 13th highest county top in England.

South West Shropshire is a markedly rural part of the county, with Clun Forest, Offa&#x27;s Dyke, the River Clun and the River Onny. The small towns of Clun and Bishop&#x27;s Castle are in this area. To the south of Clun is the Welsh border town of Knighton.

=== Natural regions ===
Natural England recognised the following national character areas that lie wholly or partially within Shropshire:

* Shropshire Hills
* Shropshire and Staffordshire Plain
* Oswestry Uplands
* Mid Severn Sandstone Plateau
* Teme Valley
* Herefordshire Lowlands
* Clun and North West Herefordshire Hills
* Whixall Moss

===Climate===
The climate of Shropshire is moderate. Rainfall averages 760 to 1,000 mm (30 to 40 in), influenced by being in the rainshadow of the Cambrian Mountains from warm, moist frontal systems of the Atlantic Ocean which bring generally light precipitation in Autumn and Spring. The hilly areas in the south and west are much colder in the winter, due to their high elevation, they share a similar climate to that of the Welsh Marches and Mid-Wales. The flat northern plain in the north and east has a similar climate to that of the rest of the West Midlands.

Being rural and inland, temperatures can fall more dramatically on clear winter nights than in many other parts of England. It was at Harper Adams University, in Edgmond, where on 10 January 1982 the lowest temperature weather record for England was broken (and is kept to this day): .

The only major Met Office weather station in the county is located at Shawbury, which is in the north, between Shrewsbury and Market Drayton.

===Geology===
Shropshire has a huge range of different types of rocks, stretching from the Precambrian until the Holocene. In the northern part of the county there are examples of Jurassic, Carboniferous, Permian and Triassic. Centrally, Precambrian, Cambrian, Ordovician, Carboniferous and Permian predominate. And in the south it is predominantly Silurian and Quaternary. Shropshire has a number of areas with Silurian and Ordovician rocks, where a number of shells, corals and trilobites can be found. Mortimer Forest and Wenlock Edge are examples where a number of fossils can be found.

===Statistical===
For Eurostat purposes, the county (less the unitary district of Telford and Wrekin) is a NUTS 3 region (code UKG22). The two Shropshire unitary areas (covering all of the ceremonial county), together with the authorities covering the ceremonial county of Staffordshire, comprise the &quot;Shropshire and Staffordshire&quot; NUTS 2 region.

==Economy==
Rayburn Range and Aga Rangemaster Group are based in Telford; the PDSA is in St George&#x27;s and Priorslee, Telford. The MoD have a significant depot at Lilleshall and Donnington. Here are also high-technology industries such as Unimation, Nikon, Hitachi Maxell, Ricoh, Capgemini, Fujitsu and Electronic Data Systems. In Hadley Castle, Denso Manufacturing UK Ltd make car air-conditioning systems and GKN Wheels make car wheels. Makita Manufacturing Europe at Hortonwood, Telford is the only plant in the UK that makes power tools.

Müller Dairy Ltd is based in Market Drayton, and Palethorpes, part of Pork Farms which makes own-label sausages. At Crudgington, Dairy Crest made Country Life butter and Clover until February 2015, and have their Technical Centre. Anglo Beef Processors (ABP Food Group) are at Harlescott in the north of Shrewsbury. Uniq plc have a plant at Minsterley and make chilled desserts for Tesco.

BT have their National Network Management Centre (Whittington House) in Whittington, Shropshire. Military helicopter training in the UK takes place at RAF Shawbury, alongside training for the RAF&#x27;s air traffic controllers (ATC).

==Towns and villages==

Shropshire has no cities, but 22 towns, of which two can be considered major. Telford is the largest town in the county with a population of 138,241 (which is approximately 30% of the total Salopian populace); whereas the county town of Shrewsbury has a lower, but still sizeable population of 71,715 (15%). The other sizeable towns are Oswestry, Bridgnorth, Newport and Ludlow. The historic town of Wellington now makes up part of the Telford conurbation. The majority of the other settlements can be classed as villages or towns such as Much Wenlock or Whitchurch. Several villages have larger populations than the smallest town, Clun. The largest of these, Bayston Hill, is the 10th most populous settlement in the county. The names of several villages close to the border are of Welsh origin, such as Gobowen and Selattyn.

The larger settlements are primarily concentrated in a central belt that roughly follows the A5/M54 roadway. Other settlements are concentrated on rivers, for example Bridgnorth and Ironbridge on the Severn, or Ludlow on the Teme, as these waterways were historically vital for trade and a supply of water.

The town of Telford was created by the merger and expansion of older, small towns to the north and east of The Wrekin. These towns now have sizeable populations that now make up the population of Telford: Wellington (20,430), Madeley (17,935), Dawley (11,399) and Oakengates (8,517), but the Telford and Wrekin borough towns incentive aims to make Oakengates into the largest of the towns.

Historically, all or parts of the towns of Halesowen, Smethwick and Oldbury, as well as the Quinton suburb of Birmingham, were in Shropshire.

==Politics==

===Parliamentary constituencies===
The county has five parliamentary constituencies. In the July 2024 General Election, two returned Conservatives MPS, two Labour and one Liberal Democrat.

At the 2005 general election, four returned Conservative MPs, Telford, returned a Labour MP. This is a marked change from the 2001 general election result, where the county returned only one Conservative, three Labour and a Liberal Democrat MP to the House of Commons (see maps to the right) (Labour = Red, Conservatives = Blue and
Liberal Democrats = Orange).

The current MPs of Shropshire, following the 2024 General Election, are:
* Shaun Davies, Labour, Telford (covering the town of Telford)
* Helen Morgan, Liberal Democrat, North Shropshire (covering the former North Shropshire and Oswestry districts, now coextensive with the North area committee)
* Stuart Anderson, Conservative, South Shropshire (covering the former Ludlow and (the majority of) Bridgnorth districts; now co-extensive with the South area committee except for the part covered by The Wrekin constituency)
* Julia Buckley, Labour, Shrewsbury (covering the former Shrewsbury and Atcham district; now co-extensive with the Central area committee)
* Mark Pritchard, Conservative, The Wrekin (covering Telford and Wrekin borough, minus Telford, and including a small area of the former Bridgnorth district/South area committee)
*Note (*), The Wrekin (historic UK Parliament constituency) was split at the 1997 election.

2021 refers to the by election in North Shropshire only.

===Divisions and environs===

Most of the ceremonial county of Shropshire is covered for purposes of local government by Shropshire Council, a unitary authority established in 2009. Telford and Wrekin is a unitary authority, with borough status, which forms part of the county for various functions such as Lord Lieutenant but is a separate local authority from Shropshire Council. Many services are shared by both authorities, such as the fire and rescue service, and the two authorities co-operate on some projects such as mapping flood risk.

The new unitary authority for Shropshire, Shropshire Council, divides the county into three areas, each with its own area committee: North, Central and South. These area committees deal with town and country planning matters.

With the parishing of the formerly unparished area of Shrewsbury in 2008, the entire ceremonial county is now parished. The sizes of parishes varies enormously in terms of area covered and population resident. Shrewsbury is the most populous parish in the county (and one of the most populous in England) with over 70,000 residents, whilst Boscobel is the smallest parish in Shropshire by geographical area and by population, with just 12 residents according to the 2001 census. The smaller parishes (with populations of less than 200) usually have a joint parish council with one or more neighbouring parishes, or in some instances, have a parish meeting (such as in Sibdon Carwood). The urban area of Telford is divided into many parishes, each covering a particular suburb, some of which are historic villages or towns (such as Madeley). The parish remains an important sub-division and tier of local government in both unitary authority areas of Shropshire.

===Local government 1974–2009===
In 1974 the non-metropolitan county of Salop was constituted, covering the entire county. After a local campaign, the council voted 48-5 to revert to Shropshire from 1 April 1980. There was a two-tier system of local government, constituting a county council (as the upper tier) and six district councils – Bridgnorth, North Shropshire, Oswestry, Shrewsbury and Atcham, South Shropshire and The Wrekin. In 1998 The Wrekin became a unitary authority, administratively separate from the county council, and became Telford and Wrekin. The two-tier structure remained in the remainder of the county and was the least populated two-tier area in England.

Oswestry and Shrewsbury &amp; Atcham were each granted borough status in 1974. Telford and Wrekin became a borough in 2002.

===2009 restructuring===

In 2006 a local government white paper supported proposals for new unitary authorities to be set up in England in certain areas. Existing non-metropolitan counties with small populations, such as Cornwall, Northumberland and Shropshire, were favoured by the government to be covered by unitary authorities in one form or another (the county either becoming a single unitary authority, or be broken into a number of unitary authorities). For the counties in the 2009 reorganisation, existing unitary authority areas within the counties&#x27; ceremonial boundaries (such as Telford and Wrekin) were not to be affected and no boundary changes were planned.

Shropshire County Council, supported by South Shropshire District Council and Oswestry Borough Council, proposed to the government that the non-metropolitan county of Shropshire become a single unitary authority. This was opposed by the other three districts in the county, with Shrewsbury &amp; Atcham Borough Council taking their objection to the High Court in a judicial review.

The proposal to create a Shropshire unitary authority, covering the area of the existing non-metropolitan county, was supported by the DCLG and 1 April 2009 was set as the date for the re-organisation to take place. The first elections to Shropshire Council took place on 4 June 2009, with the former Shropshire County Council being the continuing authority and its councillors became the first members of the new Shropshire Council on 1 April.

Part of the proposals include parishing and establishing a town council for Shrewsbury. The parish was created on 13 May 2008 and is the second most populous civil parish in England (only Weston-super-Mare has a greater population) with a population of over 70,000.

===Political control of councils===
Shropshire Council has been under Conservative control since the first election held in 2009; Telford and Wrekin Council has been under Labour control since 2011.

==Economy==

Traditionally, agriculture has dominated the economy of Shropshire. The area later became more service-oriented. The county town of Shrewsbury, the historic castle-dominated Ludlow, the International Olympic Movement&#x27;s reputed birthplace Much Wenlock and the industrial birthplace of Ironbridge Gorge are the foremost tourist areas in Shropshire, along with the restored canal-network which provides narrowboat holidays on the Shropshire Union Canal and other canals in the region. The natural beauty of the county draws people to all areas. In 2024, Shropshire was listed on the ABTA&#x27;s list of global destinations to watch for its &#x27;beautiful landscapes, towns and villages&#x27;.

Industry is mostly found in Telford, Oswestry, Whitchurch, Market Drayton and Shrewsbury, though small industrial estates have developed in most of the market towns as well as on former airfields in rural areas. In towns such as Whitchurch, much of the high street is predominantly composed of small independent business which specialise in handmade items or antiques. Shrewsbury is becoming a centre for distribution and warehousing, as it is located on a nodal point of the regional road-network.

In Telford, a new rail freight facility was opened in 2009 by Telford and Wrekin Council at Donnington with the future goal of extending the line to Stafford.

Telford and Shrewsbury are the county&#x27;s two main retail centres, with contrasting styles of shopping – Shrewsbury&#x27;s largely historic streets and Telford&#x27;s large modern mall, Telford Shopping Centre. Shrewsbury also has two medium-sized shopping centres, the indoor &quot;Pride Hill&quot; and &quot;Darwin&quot; centres (both located on Pride Hill), and (prior to its demolition in 2024) a smaller, partially covered, &quot;Riverside Mall&quot;. Shrewsbury&#x27;s location as the nearest substantial town for those in a large area of mid-Wales helps it draw in considerable numbers of shoppers, notably on Saturdays.

Well-known companies in Shropshire include Müller Dairy (UK) Ltd in Market Drayton. The Royal Air Force operates two bases at RAF Cosford and RAF Shawbury, and the charity PDSA has its head office in Priorslee, Telford.

===Statistics===
Below is the chart of regional gross value added for the non-metropolitan county (that is, excluding Telford &amp; Wrekin) of Shropshire at current basic prices, with figures in millions of British pounds sterling.

With the statistics for the borough of Telford and Wrekin included, the following represents the ceremonial county:

==Education==

The Shropshire Council area has a completely comprehensive education system, whilst in the borough of Telford and Wrekin there are two selective schools, both of which are located in Newport—these are the Haberdashers&#x27; Adams School and Newport Girls&#x27; High School (both of which are ranked within the top thirty schools in the country). In Telford itself is the Thomas Telford School, ranked as one of the best comprehensive schools in England.

Some Shropshire children attend schools in Wales, including Llanfyllin High School.

The county has many independent schools, such as Oswestry School (founded in 1407), Shrewsbury School, (founded in 1552), and Ellesmere College (founded in 1884).

There are three sixth-form colleges located in Shropshire: the New College, Telford, Shrewsbury Sixth Form College and Ludlow College. Haberdashers’ Adams and Newport Girls&#x27; High Schools both provide sixth-form education as well as secondary education.

There are also two institutions of higher education in Shropshire, the Telford campus of the University of Wolverhampton and in Edgmond, near Newport, Harper Adams University, which formerly offered mostly agriculture-based degrees but is expanding its range of provision. A third higher education institution was created in Shrewsbury in 2015, which is a campus of the University of Chester.

In Ironbridge, the University of Birmingham operates the Ironbridge Institute in partnership with the Ironbridge Gorge Museum Trust, which offers postgraduate and professional development courses in heritage.

Shropshire has the highest educational attainment in the West Midlands region.

==Transport==


Shropshire is connected to the rest of the United Kingdom via a number of road and rail links. Historically, rivers and later canals in the county were used for transport also, although their use in transport is now significantly reduced. The county&#x27;s main transport hub is Shrewsbury, through which many significant roads and railways pass and join.

Canals in Britain were originally constructed for the transport of goods, but are now mainly used for leisure. In northern Shropshire three canals with a total navigable length of are managed by the Canal &amp; River Trust: the Shropshire Union Canal (from north of Adderley to near Knighton), the Llangollen Canal (from Chirk Aqueduct to Grindley Brook) and the Montgomery Canal (from its beginning at Frankton Junction to Llanymynech). In addition, the Shrewsbury and Newport Canal potentially could be restored in the
future.

Major roads in the county include the M54 motorway, which connects Shropshire to the rest of the motorway network, and more specifically to the West Midlands county. The A5 also runs through the county, in an east–west direction. The road formerly ran through Shrewsbury, although a large dual-carriageway bypass has since been built. Other major trunk roads in the county include the north–south A49, the A53 and the A41.

There are a number of major railway lines running through the county, including the Welsh Marches Line, the Heart of Wales Line, the Cambrian Line, the Shrewsbury to Chester Line and the Wolverhampton to Shrewsbury Line, as well as heritage railways including the well established Severn Valley Railway. The Cambrian Heritage Railway exists in Oswestry. The three train operating companies working in the county are West Midlands Trains, Transport for Wales and Avanti West Coast. A new company, Wrexham &amp; Shropshire, commenced services from Shropshire to London Marylebone, in spring 2008 but the service was discontinued on 28 January 2011 leaving Shrewsbury without a direct link to the capital. Virgin Trains (the operator at the time) recommenced services from Shrewsbury to London Euston on 11 December 2014, having withdrawn them in the late 1990s, however, their successor Avanti West Coast is set to withdraw service once again in June 2024.

Two major water supply aqueducts run across Shropshire; the Elan aqueduct running through South Shropshire carrying water from Elan Valley to Birmingham and the Vyrnwy Aqueduct running through North Shropshire delivering water from Lake Vyrnwy to Liverpool.

<doc id="51613" wikidata="Q106231" url="?curid=51613" title="Daniel Webster">
<text>Daniel Webster (January 18, 1782 – October 24, 1852) was an American lawyer and statesman who represented New Hampshire and Massachusetts in the U.S. Congress and served as the 14th and 19th U.S. secretary of state under presidents William Henry Harrison, John Tyler, and Millard Fillmore. Webster was one of the most prominent American lawyers of the 19th century, arguing over 200 cases before the United States Supreme Court in his career. During his life, Webster had been a member of the Federalist Party, the National Republican Party, and the Whig Party. He was among the three members of the Great Triumvirate along with Henry Clay and John C. Calhoun.

Born in Salisbury, New Hampshire, in 1782, Webster established a successful legal practice in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, after graduating from Dartmouth College and serving a legal apprenticeship. A prominent opponent of the War of 1812, he won election to the United States House of Representatives, where he served as a leader of the Federalist Party. Webster left office after two terms and moved to Boston, Massachusetts. He became a leading attorney before the U.S. Supreme Court, winning cases such as &quot;Dartmouth College v. Woodward&quot;, &quot;McCulloch v. Maryland&quot;, and &quot;Gibbons v. Ogden&quot;.

Webster returned to Congress in 1823 and became a key supporter of President John Quincy Adams. He won election to the United States Senate in 1827 and worked with Henry Clay to build the National Republican Party in support of Adams. After Andrew Jackson defeated Adams in the 1828 U.S. presidential election, Webster became a leading opponent of Jackson&#x27;s domestic policies. He strongly objected to the theory of nullification espoused by John C. Calhoun. His 1830 &quot;Second Reply to Hayne&quot; speech is widely regarded as one of the greatest speeches ever delivered in Congress.

Webster supported Jackson&#x27;s defiant response to the Nullification Crisis but broke with the president due to disagreements over the Second Bank of the United States. Webster joined with other Jackson opponents in forming the Whig Party, and unsuccessfully ran in the 1836 U.S. presidential election. He supported Harrison in the 1840 U.S. presidential election and was appointed secretary of state after Harrison took office. Unlike the other members of Harrison&#x27;s Cabinet, he continued to serve under President Tyler after Tyler broke with congressional Whigs. As secretary of state, Webster negotiated the Webster–Ashburton Treaty, which settled border disputes with Britain. In 1837, Webster was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society.

Webster returned to the Senate in 1845 and resumed his status as a leading congressional Whig. During the Mexican–American War, he emerged as a leader of the &quot;Cotton Whigs&quot;, a faction of Northern Whigs that emphasized good relations with the South over anti-slavery policies. In 1850, President Fillmore appointed Webster as secretary of state, and Webster contributed to the passage of the Compromise of 1850, which settled several territorial issues and enacted a new fugitive slave law. The Compromise proved unpopular in much of the North and undermined Webster&#x27;s standing in his home state. Webster sought the Whig presidential nomination in the 1852 U.S. presidential election, but a split between supporters of Fillmore and Webster led to the nomination of Major General Winfield Scott. Webster is widely regarded as an important and talented attorney, orator, and politician, but historians and observers have offered mixed opinions on his moral qualities and ability as a national leader.

==Early life==
Daniel Webster was born on January 18, 1782, in Salisbury, New Hampshire, at a location within the present-day city of Franklin. He was the son of Abigail (née Eastman) and Ebenezer Webster, a farmer and local official who served in the French and Indian War and the American Revolutionary War. Ebenezer&#x27;s ancestor, the English-born Thomas Webster, had migrated to North America around 1636. Ebenezer had three children from a previous marriage who survived to maturity, as well as five children from his marriage to Abigail; Webster was the second-youngest of the eight siblings. He was particularly close to his older brother, Ezekiel, who was born in 1780. As a youth, he helped work the family farm but was frequently in poor health. With the encouragement of his parents and tutors, he often read works by authors such as Alexander Pope and Isaac Watts.

In 1796, he attended Phillips Exeter Academy, a preparatory school in Exeter, New Hampshire. Exeter&#x27;s Daniel Webster Debate Society, founded in 1818, is generally regarded as the oldest secondary school debate society in the nation. After studying the classics and other subjects for several months under a clergyman, Webster was admitted to Dartmouth College in 1797. During his time at Dartmouth, he managed the school newspaper and emerged as a strong public speaker. He was chosen as the Fourth of July orator in the college town of Hanover in 1800, and his speech contained the substance of the political principles which he would later become famous for developing. Like his father, and like many other New England farmers, Webster was firmly devoted to the Federalist Party and favored a strong central government. He graduated from Dartmouth in 1801 and was elected to the Phi Beta Kappa honor society.

After graduating from Dartmouth, he apprenticed under Salisbury lawyer Thomas W. Thompson. Though unenthusiastic about studying the law, he believed that becoming a lawyer would allow him to &quot;live comfortably&quot; and avoid the bouts of poverty that had afflicted his father. In order to help support his brother Ezekiel&#x27;s study at Dartmouth, Webster temporarily resigned from the law office to work as a schoolteacher at Fryeburg Academy in Maine. In 1804, he obtained a position in Boston under the prominent attorney Christopher Gore. Clerking for Gore—who was involved in international, national, and state politics—he learned about many legal and political subjects and met numerous New England politicians. He grew to love Boston, and, in 1805, was admitted to the bar.

==Rise to prominence==
Immediately after winning admission to the bar, Webster set up a legal practice in Boscawen, New Hampshire. He became increasingly involved in politics and began to speak locally in support of Federalist causes and candidates. After his father&#x27;s death in 1806, he handed over his practice to his brother, Ezekiel, and opened a new practice in the larger town of Portsmouth. Over the decade-long period he lived in Portsmouth, he handled over 1700 cases, becoming one of the most prominent attorneys in New Hampshire. Along with two other lawyers, he was appointed to revise the New Hampshire criminal code and devise regulations for state prisons.
During this time the ongoing Napoleonic Wars began to more strongly affect Americans, as Britain impeded U.S. trade with France and impressed American sailors who were allegedly British deserters. President Thomas Jefferson retaliated with the Embargo Act of 1807, stopping all trade to both Britain and France. As New England relied on commerce with the two nations, the region strongly suffered from the embargo, and Webster wrote an anonymous pamphlet attacking Jefferson&#x27;s policies. He also campaigned for various Federalist candidates, including presidential candidate Charles Cotesworth Pinckney and gubernatorial candidate Jeremiah Smith. Although Jefferson&#x27;s Democratic-Republican Party dominated national elections, the Federalist Party was competitive throughout the states of New England. In 1812, the United States declared war against Britain, beginning the War of 1812. On July 4, 1812, Webster was invited to give a speech before the Washington Benevolent Society. His speech, which strongly attacked the war but warned against secession, was reprinted in newspapers throughout New England.

After the speech, he was selected as a delegate to the Rockingham Convention, a local assembly that issued a report critical of Jefferson&#x27;s Democratic-Republican successor, James Madison. The Rockingham Memorial, which was largely written by Webster, challenged Madison&#x27;s reasons for going to war, arguing that France had been just as culpable in impeding American trade as Britain had and raising the specter of secession. The Rockingham Memorial gained nationwide notoriety as a document exemplifying New England&#x27;s opposition to the war. After the convention, the state Federalist Party nominated him as a candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives. Though Madison won re-election in the 1812 U.S. presidential election, the Federalist-backed presidential candidate won New England, and Federalists swept the New Hampshire elections for the House of Representatives.

==Congressman and constitutional lawyer==
===First stint in the House, 1813–1817===
By May 1813, when he arrived in the House of Representatives for the first time, the United States had seen numerous setbacks in the War of 1812. Nonetheless, Madison&#x27;s Democratic-Republican Party dominated the Thirteenth Congress, controlling over three-fifths of the seats in the House of Representatives and over two-thirds of the seats in the Senate. Webster continued to criticize the war and attacked efforts to impose conscription, wartime taxes, and a new trade embargo. He was appointed to a steering committee that coordinated Federalist actions in the House of Representatives and, by the end of the Thirteenth Congress, he had emerged as a respected speaker on the House floor. In early 1815, the war came to an end after news of the signing of the Treaty of Ghent reached the United States.

After the war, President Madison called for the establishment of the Second Bank of the United States (known as the &quot;national bank&quot;), the imposition of a protective tariff, and federally-financed public works. While Speaker of the House Henry Clay and Congressman John C. Calhoun worked to pass Madison&#x27;s proposals, other Democratic-Republicans opposed these policies because they conflicted with the party&#x27;s traditional commitment to a weaker federal government. Webster favored a national bank in principle, but he voted against the bill that established the national bank because he believed that the bank should be required to remove paper banknotes issued by various state-charted banks from circulation. Before the national bank came into operation, he then led the passage of a bill that required all debts to the government to be paid in specie, Treasury notes, or notes issued by the national bank. In the tariff debate, he occupied a middle ground; he favored using tariff rates to protect domestic manufacturing, but did not want tariff rates to be so high that they would harm his home state&#x27;s trading concerns. Though he took an active role in crafting the tariff bill, he ultimately missed the final vote on the Tariff of 1816. Seeking more lucrative legal work, he began to strongly consider relocating to Boston or New York during his time in Congress. In 1816, he declined to seek another term in the House of Representatives, instead establishing a new residence in Boston. In the 1816 elections, the Federalist Party suffered numerous defeats throughout the country and Democratic-Republican candidate James Monroe was elected president.

===Leading lawyer===

Webster continued to practice law while serving in the House of Representatives, and he argued his first case before the Supreme Court of the United States in early 1814. He had been highly regarded in New Hampshire since his days in Boscawen and was respected for his service in the House of Representatives, but he came to national prominence as counsel in a number of important Supreme Court cases. Between 1814 and 1852, he argued at least one case in the vast majority of the sessions of the Supreme Court; he served as counsel in a total of 223 cases, and won approximately half of those cases. He also represented numerous clients outside of Supreme Court cases, including prominent individuals such as George Crowninshield, Francis Cabot Lowell, and John Jacob Astor.

Though Congress was dominated by Democratic-Republicans, Chief Justice John Marshall ensured that the Federalist ideology retained a presence in the courts. Webster quickly became skilled at articulating arguments designed to appeal to Marshall and another influential Supreme Court justice, Joseph Story. He played an important role in eight of the most celebrated constitutional cases decided by the Court between 1814 and 1824. In many of these—particularly in &quot;Dartmouth College v. Woodward&quot; (1819) and &quot;Gibbons v. Ogden&quot; (1824)—the Supreme Court handed down decisions based largely on his arguments. Marshall&#x27;s most famous declaration, &quot;the power to tax is the power to destroy,&quot; in &quot;McCulloch v. Maryland&quot; (1819), was taken from Webster&#x27;s presentation against the state of Maryland. As a result of his series of successes in Supreme Court cases, many people began calling him the &quot;Great Expounder and Defender of the Constitution.&quot; He would continue to argue cases before the Supreme Court after Marshall&#x27;s death in 1835, but he generally found the Taney Court to be less receptive to his arguments.

In &quot;Dartmouth College v. Woodward&quot;, Webster was retained by the Federalist trustees of his alma mater, Dartmouth College, in their case against the newly elected New Hampshire Democratic-Republican state legislature. The legislature had passed new laws converting Dartmouth into a state institution, by changing the size of the college&#x27;s trustee body and adding a further board of overseers, which they put into the hands of the state senate. He argued that the Constitution&#x27;s Contract Clause prohibited the legislature from altering the college&#x27;s board of trustees. The Marshall Court, continuing with its history of limiting states&#x27; rights and reaffirming the supremacy of the constitutional protection of contract, ruled in favor of Dartmouth. The ruling set the important precedent that corporations did not, as many then held, have to justify their privileges by acting in the public interest, but were independent of the states.

He remained politically active during his time out of Congress, serving as a presidential elector, meeting with officials like Secretary of War John C. Calhoun, and delivering a well-received speech that attacked high tariffs. With the Federalists fading away as a national party, the period of Monroe&#x27;s presidency came to be known as the &quot;Era of Good Feelings&quot; due to the lack of partisan conflict. As the Federalists failed to field a candidate in the 1820 U.S. presidential election, Webster, acting in his capacity as a presidential elector, cast his vote for Monroe. He was then elected as a delegate to the 1820 Massachusetts Constitutional Convention. There he spoke in opposition to suffrage for all regardless of property ownership, arguing that power naturally follows property, and the vote should be limited accordingly; but the constitution was amended against his advice. He also supported the (existing) districting of the state senate so that each seat represented an equal amount of property. His performance at the convention furthered his reputation. In a letter to a mutual friend, Joseph Story wrote, &quot;our friend Webster has gained a noble reputation. He was before known as a lawyer; but he has now secured the title of an eminent and enlightened statesman.&quot; In December 1820, he delivered an enthusiastically received address commemorating the bicentennial of the landing of the &quot;Mayflower&quot; at Plymouth Rock.
===Second stint in the House, 1823–1827===
At the behest of Federalist leaders and the business elite in Boston, Webster agreed to run for the United States House of Representatives in 1822. He won the election and returned to Congress in December 1823. In recognition of his mastery of legal issues, Speaker of the House Henry Clay assigned him the chairmanship of the House Judiciary Committee. In that role, he tried to pass a bill that would relieve Supreme Court justices of having to travel to far-flung western districts, but his bill did not receive a vote in the House. Seeking to re-establish his reputation for oratorical prowess on the floor of the House of Representatives, he gave a speech supporting the Greek cause in the Greek War of Independence. In another speech, he attacked the bill imposing the Tariff of 1824, arguing that high tariff rates unfairly benefited manufacturing to the detriment of agriculture and commerce. In a third speech, he defended the construction of internal improvements by the federal government, arguing that roads helped unite the nation both economically and in creating a &quot;feeling truly national.&quot;
While a representative, he continued accepting speaking engagements in New England, most notably his oration on the fiftieth anniversary of the Battle of Bunker Hill. He also continued his legal work, though his government service required him to rely more on his law partners.

In the 1824 U.S. presidential election, the Democratic-Republicans split among Clay, Calhoun, William H. Crawford, Andrew Jackson, and John Quincy Adams. Despite their shared connection to Massachusetts, Webster had an uneasy relationship with Adams because the latter had left the Federalist Party earlier in his career; for his part, Adams detested him. As no candidate won a majority of the electoral vote, the 1824 election was decided in a contingent election held by the House of Representatives. Webster had remained neutral prior to the election, but he supported Adams in the contingent election, in large part because he viewed Jackson as completely unqualified to be president and Crawford had suffered a major stroke. Along with Clay, he helped rally members of the House around Adams, and Adams was elected on the first ballot of the contingent election.

In 1825, President Adams set off a partisan realignment by putting forward an ambitious domestic program, based on Clay&#x27;s American System, that included a vast network of federally-funded infrastructure projects. States&#x27; rights Democratic-Republicans, including Senator Martin Van Buren and Vice President John C. Calhoun, strongly opposed the program and rallied around Jackson. While some Federalists gravitated to Jackson&#x27;s camp, Webster became the leader of the pro-administration forces in the House of Representatives. Supporters of Adams became known as National Republicans, while Jackson&#x27;s followers coalesced into the Democratic Party. Like many Federalists, he did not immediately cast aside his partisan identity as a Federalist but embraced the American System and began to favor protective tariff rates. Justus D. Doenecke indicates that his newfound support of protective tariffs was the result of &quot;his new closeness to the rising mill-owning families of the region, the Lawrences and the Lowells.&quot; He also backed the administration&#x27;s defense of treaty-sanctioned Creek Indian land rights against Georgia&#x27;s expansionist claims.

==First period in the Senate==
===Adams administration, 1827–1829===
In 1827, the Massachusetts legislature elected him to the United States Senate. He was initially reluctant to leave the House of Representatives, where he had established seniority and a strong base of power, but ultimately accepted election to the Senate. After a period of consideration, he voted for the Tariff of 1828, which raised tariff rates. Prior to the 1828 U.S. presidential election, he worked with Clay to build the National Republican Party across the country. While Clay rallied support for the party in the West, he emerged as a leading National Republican in the Northeastern states. Despite his efforts and those of Clay, Democratic candidate Andrew Jackson decisively defeated President Adams in the 1828 election.

===Jackson administration, 1829–1837===
====Second Reply to Hayne====
After Jackson took office, Webster opposed most of the measures favored by the new administration, including the Indian Removal Act and the establishment of the spoils system. The Jackson administration suffered from factionalism between supporters of Secretary of State Van Buren and Vice President Calhoun, the latter of whom took a prominent role in propounding the doctrine of nullification. Calhoun held that the states had the power to &quot;nullify&quot; laws, and he and his allies sought to nullify the high tariff rates imposed by the Tariff of 1828 (which they referred to as the &quot;Tariff of Abominations&quot;). During a debate over land policy in January 1830, South Carolina Senator Robert Y. Hayne, in an effort to sway the West against the North and the tariff, accused the North of attempting to limit Western expansion for their own benefit. Hayne served as a surrogate for Vice President Calhoun, who could not himself address the Senate on the issue due to his status as the Senate&#x27;s presiding officer. Webster objected to the sectional attack on the North, but even more strongly objected to Hayne&#x27;s pro-states&#x27; rights position. Speaking before the Senate, he articulated his belief in a &quot;perpetual&quot; union and attacked the institution of slavery, baiting Hayne into expounding on the doctrine of nullification on the Senate floor.

Replying to his first speech, Hayne accused him of &quot;making war upon the unoffending South,&quot; and he asserted that nullification was constitutional because the federal government was ultimately subservient to the states. On January 27, Webster delivered his response, titled the &quot;Second Reply to Hayne&quot;. He held that the people, and not the states, held ultimate power, and the people had established the Constitution as the supreme law of the land. He further argued that the doctrine of nullification &quot;approach[ed] absurdity,&quot; and, by denying power to the federal government, would effectively restore the balance of power established under the Articles of Confederation. He argued that nullification constituted treason against the United States, and would ultimately lead to civil war as state officials would call out the militia to resist federal laws and actions. He ended his speech with a call for &quot;Liberty &quot;and&quot; Union, now and for ever, one and inseparable!&quot; The &quot;Second Reply to Hayne&quot; was reprinted thousands of times, and was favorably received throughout the country. In assessing the speech&#x27;s impact and popularity, some contemporaries compared it to the Federalist Papers. Three months after he delivered the &quot;Second Reply to Hayne&quot;, Calhoun openly broke with President Jackson when, in response to Jackson&#x27;s toast of &quot;Our Union, it be preserved,&quot; Calhoun replied, &quot;The Union: Next to our liberty, the most dear.&quot;

====Bank War and 1832 election====

By 1830, he considered Clay to be the likely National Republican nominee in the 1832 U.S. presidential election, though he was skeptical that Clay would be able to defeat the Democratic nominee. The establishment of the Anti-Masonic Party, a third party opposed to both Jackson and Clay, added a new factor into the election. Some Anti-Masonic leaders attempted to recruit him to run for the presidency, but he ultimately declined to run for fear of alienating Clay and other National Republicans. Instead, he undertook a subtle campaign to win the National Republican nomination, planning a tour of the Northeast and the Northwest; His angling for the presidency marked the start of an ambivalent relationship between Clay and Webster. Nonetheless, he urged Clay to accept election to the Senate, and the two convinced Nicholas Biddle, the president of the national bank, to apply for an early renewal of the national bank&#x27;s charter. As Jackson had a long record of opposing the national bank, both hoped to make the national bank an issue in the 1832 presidential election. Clay was formally nominated by the National Republicans in December 1831, while Jackson was nominated for a second term in 1832.

Biddle requested a renewal of the national bank&#x27;s charter in January 1832, setting off what became known as the &quot;Bank War.&quot; With Clay focusing on a tariff bill, Webster became the unofficial leader of pro-national bank forces in the Senate. He helped ensure that Congress approved a renewal of the charter without making any major modifications, such as a provision that would allow states to prevent the national bank from establishing branches within their borders. Congress approved the charter renewal, but, as was expected, Jackson vetoed the bill in July 1832; Jackson argued the bank was unconstitutional and served to &quot;make the rich richer and the potent more powerful.&quot; On the Senate floor, Webster attacked the veto, arguing that only the judicial branch could judge a bill&#x27;s constitutionality. Afterward he supported Clay&#x27;s presidential campaign and continued his efforts on behalf of the national bank, but Jackson was re-elected by a decisive margin.

==== Nullification Crisis ====

Though Congress replaced the &quot;Tariff of Abominations&quot; with the Tariff of 1832, Calhoun and his Nullifier allies remained dissatisfied with tariff rates. Shortly after the 1832 presidential election, a South Carolina convention passed a resolution declaring the Tariff of 1832 to be &quot;null, void, and no law&quot; in South Carolina, marking the start of the Nullification Crisis. Hayne resigned from the Senate to become the governor of South Carolina, while Calhoun took Hayne&#x27;s former seat in the Senate. In December 1832, Jackson issued the Proclamation to the People of South Carolina, warning that he would not allow South Carolina to defy federal law. Webster strongly approved of the Proclamation, telling an audience at Faneuil Hall that Jackson had articulated &quot;the true principles of the Constitution,&quot; and that he would give the president &quot;my entire and cordial support&quot; in the crisis. He strongly supported Jackson&#x27;s proposed Force Bill, which would authorize the president to use force against states that attempted to obstruct federal law. At the same time, he opposed Clay&#x27;s efforts to end the crisis by lowering tariff rates, as he believed that making concessions to Calhoun&#x27;s forces would set a bad precedent. After a spirited debate between himself and Calhoun, Congress passed the Force Bill in February 1833. Soon after, it passed the Tariff of 1833, the product of negotiations between Clay and Calhoun; the bill called for the gradual lowering of tariffs over a ten-year period. Although they symbolically &quot;nullified&quot; the Force Bill, South Carolina leaders accepted the new tariff law, bringing an end to the Nullification Crisis.

====Rise of the Whig Party and 1836 candidacy====
As Calhoun drifted away from the Democratic Party and occasionally cooperated with the National Republicans to oppose Jackson, some contemporaries began to refer to Calhoun, Webster, and Clay as &quot;the Great Triumvirate.&quot; At the same time, Webster&#x27;s alliance with Jackson in the Nullification Crisis caused some observers to wonder if he would join the Democratic Party or found a new party centered on their nationalistic vision. Jackson&#x27;s decision to remove government deposits from the national bank in late 1833 ended any possibility of a Webster-Jackson alliance and helped to solidify partisan lines. As chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Webster led the Senate&#x27;s effort to prevent Jackson&#x27;s secretary of the treasury, Roger Taney, from removing government deposits. As the national bank&#x27;s charter was due to expire in 1836, before the end of Jackson&#x27;s term, he attempted to save the national bank through a compromise measure, but Democrats rejected his proposal. Ultimately, the Senate was unable to prevent the deposit removals or the expiration of the national bank&#x27;s charter, but it did pass resolutions censuring Jackson and Taney. Webster&#x27;s decision to vote for the censure resolution caused a permanent break with Jackson.

In the aftermath of the battle over the national bank, Jackson&#x27;s political opponents coalesced into the Whig Party. By taking a name rooted in American and British history, the Whigs implicitly criticized Jackson as a tyrannical executive. Although National Republicans like Clay and Webster formed the core of the Whig Party, Anti-Masonic leaders like William H. Seward and states&#x27; rights Democrats like John Tyler also joined the new party. The Whig Party proved more durable than the National Republican Party and, along with the Democrats, the Whigs became one of the two major parties of the Second Party System, which would extend into the 1850s. By 1834, Webster supporters such as Caleb Cushing, Rufus Choate, Abbott Lawrence, and Edward Everett had begun preparing for his candidacy in the 1836 U.S. presidential election. With Clay showing no indication of making another run, Webster hoped to become the main Whig candidate in the 1836 election, but General William Henry Harrison and Senator Hugh Lawson White retained strong support in the West and the South, respectively. Rather than uniting behind one presidential candidate, Whig leaders settled on a strategy of running multiple candidates in order to force a contingent election in the House of Representatives.

He was nominated for president by the Massachusetts legislature, but Harrison won the backing of most Whigs outside of the South. Although his reputation as a national figure was far greater than that of Harrison, many Whigs hoped that Harrison&#x27;s military record would allow him to replicate Jackson&#x27;s 1832 victory. Webster&#x27;s chances also suffered from his lingering association with the Federalist Party, his close relationship with elite politicians and businessmen, and his lack of appeal among the broad populace; Robert Remini writes that the American public &quot;admired and revered him but did not love or trust him.&quot; With little support outside of his home state, he attempted to withdraw his presidential candidacy, but, to his eventual regret, Massachusetts Whig leaders convinced him to stay in the race. Meanwhile, the 1835 Democratic National Convention nominated Van Buren, Jackson&#x27;s preferred successor, for president. In the 1836 election, Van Buren won a majority of the popular and electoral vote, Harrison finished a distant second, and White carried two Southern states. Webster won only the electoral votes of Massachusetts. Adding to his displeasure, he lost a major Supreme Court decision, &quot;Charles River Bridge v. Warren Bridge&quot;, shortly after the election.

===Van Buren administration, 1837–1841===
Shortly after Van Buren took office, a major economic downturn known as the Panic of 1837 began. Webster and his Whig allies blamed Jackson&#x27;s policies, including the Specie Circular, for the panic, but a worldwide economic downturn was a major contributing factor. The panic hit the country hard and proved disastrous for Webster&#x27;s personal finances. With the help of Nicholas Biddle and other friendly bankers, Webster had gone into debt to engage in land speculation on a broad scale. His debt was exacerbated by his propensity for lavishly furnishing his estate and giving away money with &quot;reckless generosity and heedless profusion,&quot; in addition to indulging the smaller-scale &quot;passions and appetites&quot; of gambling and alcohol. The panic resulted in many creditors calling in their loans and, according to Remini, Webster would never emerge from debt after 1837. Nonetheless, he remained focused on his political career. While Whigs promoted the American System as the means for economic recovery, Van Buren&#x27;s response to the panic focused on the practice of &quot;strict economy and frugality.&quot; Webster attacked Van Buren&#x27;s proposals to address the economic crisis, including the establishment of an Independent Treasury system, and he helped arrange for the rescinding of the Specie Circular.

He entertained hopes of winning the Whig nomination in the 1840 U.S. presidential election but ultimately declined to challenge Clay or Harrison, both of whom commanded broader support within the party. He remained neutral between Clay and Harrison, instead departing for a trip to Europe, where he attended his daughter&#x27;s wedding and befriended Alexander Baring, 1st Baron Ashburton. While he was abroad, the 1839 Whig National Convention nominated Harrison for president. Although many Whigs favored a Harrison-Webster ticket, the convention instead nominated John Tyler of Virginia for vice president. Webster served as a prominent campaign surrogate for Harrison in the 1840 election, although he disliked the party&#x27;s new, popular style of campaigning that made use of songs and slogans like &quot;Tippecanoe and Tyler too.&quot; The Whigs enjoyed great success in the 1840 elections, as Harrison took a majority of the popular and electoral vote and the party won control of Congress.

==Secretary of State in the Tyler administration==

Harrison extensively consulted Webster and Clay regarding presidential appointments, and the two Whig leaders competed to place their supporters and allies in key positions. Harrison initially hoped that Webster would serve as secretary of the treasury in order to spearhead his economic program, but Webster instead became secretary of state, giving him oversight of foreign affairs. Just one month after taking office, Harrison died from pneumonia, and was succeeded by John Tyler. Though Tyler and Webster strongly differed regarding ideology (Tyler was a devotee of states&#x27; rights) and personality, they initially enjoyed a strong working relationship, partly because each saw Clay as a rival for power in the Whig Party. As Tyler, a former Democrat, had long been skeptical of the need for a national bank, Webster urged Whig congressmen to back a compromise bill put forward by Secretary of the Treasury Thomas Ewing which would have re-established the national bank but restricted its branching power. Congress rejected the compromise and instead passed Clay&#x27;s bill, which was subsequently vetoed by Tyler. After Tyler vetoed another Whig bill, every Cabinet member except for Webster resigned, and a caucus of Whigs voted to expel Tyler from the party in September 1841. When Webster informed Tyler that he would not resign, Tyler responded, &quot;give me your hand on that, and now I will say to you that Henry Clay is a doomed man.&quot;

Facing a hostile Congress, Tyler and Webster turned their attention to foreign policy. The administration put a new emphasis on American influence in the Pacific Ocean, reaching the first U.S. treaty with China, seeking to partition Oregon Country with Britain, and announcing that the United States would oppose any attempt to colonize the Hawaiian Islands. The most pressing foreign policy issue involved relations with Britain, as the United States had nearly gone to war with Britain over the Caroline affair and a border conflict between Maine and Canada. Seeking improved relations with the United States, British prime minister Robert Peel dispatched Lord Ashburton on a special mission to the United States. After extensive negotiations, the United States and Britain reached the Webster–Ashburton Treaty, which clearly delineated Maine&#x27;s northern border and other sections of the U.S.–Canada border that had been in dispute. Senator Thomas Hart Benton led Senate opposition to the treaty, arguing that it &quot;needlessly and shamelessly&quot; relinquished American territory, but few others joined Benton in voting against the treaty, and it won ratification.

After mid-1841, congressional Whigs continually pressured Webster to resign, and by early 1843, Tyler had also begun to pressure Webster to leave office. As Tyler moved even farther away from Whig positions and began preparing a campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination in the 1844 U.S. presidential election, Webster left office in May 1843. With Webster gone, Tyler turned his attention to the Texas annexation. Clay was nominated for president at the 1844 Whig National Convention, while the Democrats spurned both Tyler and former president Van Buren in favor of James K. Polk, a protege of Andrew Jackson. Webster&#x27;s service in the Tyler administration had badly damaged his credibility among Whigs, but he began to rebuild old alliances within the party. Tyler&#x27;s attempts to annex Texas became the key issue in the 1844 election, and Webster came out strongly against annexation. He campaigned on behalf of Clay, telling one crowd, &quot;I know of no great national constitutional question; I know of no great interest of the country ... in which there is any difference between the distinguished leader of the Whig Party and myself.&quot; Despite Webster&#x27;s campaigning, Polk defeated Clay in a close election. The election of the expansionist Polk ensured the annexation of Texas, and annexation was completed after Polk took office.

==Second period in the Senate==
===Polk administration, 1845–1849===

Webster considered retiring from public office after the 1844 election, but he accepted election to the United States Senate in early 1845. Webster sought to block the adoption of Polk&#x27;s domestic policies, but Congress, controlled by Democrats, reduced tariff rates through the Walker tariff and re-established the Independent Treasury system. In May 1846, the Mexican–American War began after Congress, responding to a clash instigated by U.S. troops against the Mexican Army at the disputed Texas–Mexico border, declared war on Mexico. During the war, Northern Whigs became increasingly split between &quot;Conscience Whigs&quot; like Charles Sumner, who strongly favored anti-slavery policies, and &quot;Cotton Whigs&quot; like Webster, who emphasized good relations with Southern leaders. Webster had been a long-standing opponent of slavery; in an 1837 speech he called slavery a &quot;great moral, social, and political evil,&quot; and added that he would vote against &quot;any thing that shall extend the slavery of the African race on this continent, or add other slaveholding states to the Union.&quot; But, unlike his more strongly anti-slavery constituents, he did not believe that Congress should interfere with slavery in the states, and he placed less emphasis on preventing the spread of slavery into the territories. Nonetheless, because Webster opposed the acquisition of Mexican territory (with the exception of San Francisco), he voted against the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, in which the United States acquired the Mexican Cession.

General Zachary Taylor&#x27;s success in the Mexican–American War drove him to the front ranks of Whig candidates in the 1848 U.S. presidential election. As Taylor held unclear political positions and had never been publicly affiliated with the Whig Party, Clay and Webster each launched their own bids for the presidency, but opposition from the Conscience Whigs badly damaged Webster&#x27;s standing. On the first ballot of the 1848 Whig National Convention Webster finished a distant fourth behind Taylor, Clay, and General Winfield Scott. Taylor ultimately won the presidential nomination on the convention&#x27;s fourth ballot, while Millard Fillmore of New York was selected as the party&#x27;s vice presidential nominee. After Webster declined the request of Conscience Whigs to lead a new, anti-slavery third party, Conscience Whigs and &quot;Barnburner&quot; Democrats launched the Free Soil Party and nominated a ticket consisting of former president Van Buren and Charles Francis Adams. Despite having previously stated that he would not support Taylor in the 1848 presidential campaign, Webster threw his backing behind Taylor. Ultimately, Taylor won the election, defeating both Van Buren and Democratic nominee Lewis Cass.

===Taylor administration, 1849–1850===

Having only tepidly endorsed Taylor&#x27;s campaign, Webster was excluded from the new administration&#x27;s Cabinet and was not consulted on major appointments. After the 1848 election, the fate of the territories acquired in the Mexican-American War became a major subject of debate in Congress, as Northern and Southern leaders quarreled over the extension of slavery. In January 1850, Clay introduced a plan which combined the major subjects under discussion. His legislative package included the admission of California as a free state, the cession by Texas of some of its northern and western territorial claims in return for debt relief, the establishment of New Mexico and Utah territories, a ban on the importation of slaves into the District of Columbia for sale, and a more stringent fugitive slave law. The plan faced opposition from strongly pro-slavery Southern leaders like Calhoun and anti-slavery Northerners like William Seward and Salmon Chase. President Taylor also opposed Clay&#x27;s proposal, since he favored granting California statehood immediately and denied the legitimacy of Texas&#x27;s claims over New Mexico.

Clay had won Webster&#x27;s backing for his proposal before presenting it to Congress, and Webster provided strong support for Clay&#x27;s bill in the Senate. In what became known as the &quot;Seventh of March Speech&quot;, Webster attacked Northerners and Southerners alike for stirring up tensions over slavery. He admonished Northerners for obstructing the return of fugitive slaves but attacked Southern leaders for openly contemplating secession. After the speech, Webster was bitterly attacked by New England abolitionists. Theodore Parker complained, &quot;No living man has done so much to debauch the conscience of the nation,&quot; while Horace Mann described Webster as &quot;a fallen star! Lucifer descending from Heaven!&quot; In contrast to that view, James G. Blaine wrote a few decades later:
The debate over Clay&#x27;s compromise proposal continued into July 1850, when Taylor suddenly and unexpectedly died of an illness.

==Secretary of State in the Fillmore administration==
===Compromise of 1850===
Millard Fillmore ascended to the presidency upon Taylor&#x27;s death. Shortly after taking office, Fillmore dismissed Taylor&#x27;s Cabinet appointees, named Webster as his secretary of state, and came out in favor of Clay&#x27;s compromise. Fillmore chose the remaining members of his Cabinet in consultation with Webster, and Webster became the unofficial leader in the Cabinet. After Fillmore took office, Clay took a temporary leave from the Senate, but Democratic senator Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois took the lead in advocating for a compromise based largely on Clay&#x27;s proposals. On behalf of the president, Webster drafted a special message to Congress calling for an end to the crisis over the territories, and he used the power of patronage to woo potential supporters. Soon after the Fillmore administration delivered the special message, Congress passed Douglas&#x27;s legislative package, which became known as the Compromise of 1850.

Due to a prosperous economy and various other trends, few Whigs pushed for a revival of the national bank and other long-standing party policies during the Fillmore administration, and the Compromise of 1850 became the central political issue. While Fillmore hoped to reconcile with anti-Compromise Northern Whigs, Webster sought to purge them from the party, and he frequently intervened to block the election or appointment of anti-Compromise Whigs. In the North, the most controversial portion of the Compromise of 1850 was the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, and Webster became closely involved in enforcing the law. Disputes over fugitive slaves were widely publicized North and South, inflaming passions and raising tensions in the aftermath of the Compromise of 1850. Many of the administration&#x27;s prosecutions or attempts to return slaves ended badly for the government, as in the case of Shadrach Minkins. In Massachusetts, anti-slavery Whigs allied with Democrats and, in a major rebuke to Webster, elected Free Soil leader Charles Sumner to the Senate.

===Opening of the New York &amp; Erie Rail Road===
When the New York &amp; Erie Rail Road was completed in May 1851, President Fillmore and several members of his cabinet, including Webster, made a special, two-day excursion run to open the railway. It is reported that Webster viewed the entire run from a rocking chair attached to a flatcar, with a steamer rug and jug of high-quality Medford rum. At stops, he would get down and speechify.

===Foreign affairs===

Fillmore appointed Webster not only for his national stature and pro-Compromise position, but also for his experience in foreign affairs, and Fillmore relied on Webster to guide his administration&#x27;s foreign policy. In the aftermath of the failed Hungarian Revolution of 1848, a diplomatic incident with the Austrian Empire arose over the Taylor administration&#x27;s sympathetic actions towards the Hungarian rebels. Rather than backing down, the Fillmore administration secured the release of exiled Hungarian leader Lajos Kossuth from the Ottoman Empire and gave a banquet in Kossuth&#x27;s honor. In 1851, Webster wrote a book about Kossuth&#x27;s life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Webster/1851/Kossuth&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The administration was particularly active in Asia and the Pacific, especially with regard to Japan, which prohibited nearly all foreign contact. In November 1852, the administration launched the Perry Expedition to force Japan to establish trade relations with the United States. Perry was successful in his mission, as Japan agreed to open trade relations with the 1854 Convention of Kanagawa. The Fillmore administration also reached trade agreements with Latin American countries, worked to counter British influence in Central America and took measures to prevent unauthorized military expeditions against Cuba and other Latin American countries. An expedition to Cuba led by Narciso López precipitated a diplomatic crisis with Spain, but Fillmore, Webster, and the Spanish government worked out a series of face-saving measures that prevented an outbreak of hostilities from occurring.

===1852 election===
Encouraged by Fillmore&#x27;s professed lack of desire to pursue the Whig nomination in the 1852 U.S. presidential election, Webster launched another campaign for the presidency in 1851. Fillmore was sympathetic to the ambitions of his secretary of state, but he was unwilling to completely rule out accepting the party&#x27;s 1852 nomination, as he feared doing so would allow his rival, William Seward, to gain control of the party. Another candidate emerged in the form of General Winfield Scott, who, like previously successful Whig presidential nominees William Henry Harrison and Zachary Taylor, had earned fame for his martial accomplishments. Scott had supported the Compromise of 1850, but his association with Seward made him unacceptable to Southern Whigs. As Southerners retained a lingering distrust of Webster, they threw their backing behind Fillmore. Thus, Scott emerged as the preferred candidate of most Northern Whigs, Fillmore became the main candidate of Southern Whigs, and Webster was only able to win backing from a handful of delegates, most of whom were from New England.

On the first presidential ballot of the 1852 Whig National Convention, Fillmore received 133 of the necessary 147 votes, while Scott won 131 and Webster won 29. Although both Webster and Fillmore were willing to withdraw in favor of the other, their respective delegates at the convention were unable to unite around one candidate, and Scott took the nomination on the 53rd ballot. Webster was personally devastated by the defeat, and he refused to endorse Scott&#x27;s candidacy. Webster allowed various third party groups to nominate him for president, although he did not openly condone these efforts. Scott proved to be a poor candidate, and he suffered the worst defeat in Whig history, losing to Democratic nominee Franklin Pierce. Thousands of anti-Scott Whigs and members of the nativist Native American Party cast their vote for Webster.

==Personal life, family, and religious views==
In 1808, Webster married Grace Fletcher, a schoolteacher and the daughter of a New Hampshire clergyman. Between 1810 and 1822, Daniel and Grace had five children: Grace, Daniel &quot;Fletcher&quot;, Julia, Edward, and Charles. Grace and Charles died before reaching adulthood. Webster&#x27;s wife, Grace, died in January 1828 due to a cancerous tumor, and Webster suffered another loss when his brother, Ezekiel, died in April 1829. In December 1829, Webster married Caroline LeRoy, the 32-year-old daughter of New York merchant Herman LeRoy. They remained married until Webster&#x27;s death, and she lived until 1882. She and Webster had two children together, another daughter named Grace and a son named Noah Webster. After the death of his first wife, Webster was frequently the subject of rumors in Washington regarding his alleged promiscuity; many suspected that the painter Sarah Goodridge, with whom he had a close relationship, was his mistress.

Webster and his family lived in Portsmouth until 1816 when they relocated to Boston. In 1831, Webster purchased a 150-acre estate (now known as the Thomas–Webster Estate) in Marshfield, Massachusetts. In the ensuing years, Webster spent much of his earnings making various improvements to his estate, and he made it his primary residence in 1837. After 1829, Webster also owned his father&#x27;s home, the Elms, in Franklin, New Hampshire. Webster&#x27;s older son, Fletcher, married a niece of Joseph Story, established a profitable law practice, served as chief clerk of the State Department, and was the only one of his siblings to outlive his father. Fletcher died at the 1862 Second Battle of Bull Run while serving as a colonel in the Union army. Webster&#x27;s younger son, Edward, died of typhoid fever in January 1848 while serving in the Mexican-American War. Webster&#x27;s daughter, Julia, married Samuel Appleton Appleton, but died of tuberculosis in April 1848.

Conflicting opinions have been voiced as to his religion. The Unitarian Universalist Church, citing &quot;Unitarianism in America&quot; from 1902, claim him as their own. Another source, the 1856 biography &quot;The American Statesman: The Life and Character of Daniel Webster&quot;, proclaims him an avowed orthodox Trinitarian, baptized and raised in an Orthodox Congregational Church, and who died a member of the Episcopal Church. Remini writes that, though Webster occasionally attended other churches, he remained closely affiliated with the Congregational church throughout his life. In an 1807 letter to a Congregational pastor, Webster wrote, &quot;I believe in the utter inability of any human being to work out his own Salvation, without the constant aids of the spirit of all grace... Although I have great respect for some other forms of worship, I believe the Congregational mode, on the whole, to be preferable to any other.&quot;

==Death==

By early 1852, Webster had begun to suffer from cirrhosis of the liver, and his poor health increasingly made it difficult for him to serve as secretary of state. In September 1852, Webster returned to his Marshfield estate, where his health continued to decline due to cirrhosis and a subdural hematoma. He died in Marshfield, Massachusetts on October 24, 1852, at the age of 70, and is buried in Winslow Cemetery near his estate. His last words were, &quot;I still live.&quot;

==Legacy==

===Historical evaluations===
Remini writes that &quot;whether men hated or admired [Webster], all agreed ... on the majesty of his oratory, the immensity of his intellectual powers, and the primacy of his constitutional knowledge.&quot; Ralph Waldo Emerson, who had criticized Webster following the Seventh of March address, remarked in the immediate aftermath of his death that Webster was &quot;the completest man&quot;, and that &quot;nature had not in our days, or not since Napoleon, cut out such a masterpiece.&quot; In &quot;Profiles in Courage&quot;, John F. Kennedy called Webster&#x27;s defense of the Compromise of 1850, despite the risk to his presidential ambitions and the denunciations he faced from the North, one of the &quot;greatest acts of courageous principle&quot; in the history of the Senate. Conversely, &quot;Seventh of March&quot; has been criticized by Henry Cabot Lodge who contrasted the speech&#x27;s support of the 1850 compromise with his 1833 rejection of similar measures. &quot;While he was brave and true and wise in 1833,&quot; said Lodge, &quot;in 1850 he was not only inconsistent, but that he erred deeply in policy and statesmanship&quot; in his advocacy of a policy that &quot;made war inevitable by encouraging slave-holders to believe that they could always obtain anything they wanted by a sufficient show of violence.&quot;

Several historians suggest Webster failed to exercise leadership for any political issue or vision. Lodge describes Webster&#x27;s &quot;susceptibility to outside influences that formed such an odd trait in the character of a man so imperious by nature. When acting alone, he spoke his own opinions. When in a situation where public opinion was concentrated against him, he submitted to modifications of his views with a curious and indolent indifference.&quot; Similarly, Arthur Schlesinger cites Webster&#x27;s letter requesting retainers for fighting for the national bank, one of his most inveterate causes; he then asks how Webster could &quot;expect the American people to follow him through hell or high water when he would not lead unless someone made up a purse for him?&quot; Remini writes that &quot;Webster was a thoroughgoing elitist—and he reveled in it.&quot;

Webster retains his high prestige in some recent historiography. Baxter argues that his nationalistic view of the union as one and inseparable from liberty helped the union to triumph over the states-rights Confederacy, making it his greatest contribution. Bartlett, however, emphasizing Webster&#x27;s private life, says his great oratorical achievements were in part undercut by his improvidence with money, his excessively opulent lifestyle, and his numerous conflict-of-interest situations. Remini points out that Webster&#x27;s historical orations taught Americans their history before textbooks were widely available. In 1957, a Senate Committee headed by then Senator John F. Kennedy named Webster, Clay, Calhoun, Robert M. La Follette, and Robert A. Taft as the five greatest senators in history—portraits of the &quot;famous five&quot; were added to the Senate Reception Room.

While evaluations on his political career vary, Webster is widely praised for his talent as an orator and attorney. Former Solicitor General Seth P. Waxman writes that &quot;in the realm of advocacy, Webster doesn&#x27;t merely sit in the Pantheon: He is Zeus himself.&quot; Kennedy praised Webster&#x27;s &quot;ability to make alive and supreme the latent sense of oneness, of union, that all Americans felt but few could express.&quot; Webster&#x27;s &quot;Reply to Hayne&quot; in 1830 was generally regarded as &quot;the most eloquent speech ever delivered in Congress,&quot; and was a stock exercise for oratory students for 75 years. Schlesinger, however, notes that he is also an example of the limitations of formal oratory: Congress heard Webster or Clay with admiration, but they rarely prevailed at the vote. Plainer speech and party solidarity were more effective, and Webster never approached Jackson&#x27;s popular appeal.

===Memorials===
Webster&#x27;s legacy has been commemorated with statues and other memorials. A statue stands in the National Statuary Hall Collection, while another statue stands in Central Park. Another Webster statue is located outside the Massachusetts State House. The &quot;USS Daniel Webster (SSBN-626)&quot; and the liberty ship were both named for Webster. The first Webster postage stamp was issued in 1870. In all, Daniel Webster is honored on 14 different US postage issues, more than most U.S. Presidents. There is a Daniel Webster Highway and Mount Webster in New Hampshire There are 27 towns named for Webster in California, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia, and Wisconsin. A ghost town in Colorado and Webster Hollow in Tennessee are also named for Daniel Webster. Seven counties or parishes are named for Webster. Daniel Webster Elementary School in Marshfield, Massachusetts bears his name.


===In media===

Webster is the major character in a fictional short story, &quot;The Devil and Daniel Webster&quot;, by Stephen Vincent Benét. It serves as the basis for a one-act opera of the same name written by American composer Douglas Moore and the 1941 film directed by William Dieterle.

Webster is briefly discussed in Chapter XIX of MacKinlay Kantor&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel &quot;Andersonville&quot; (1955).

Jefferson Smith sits at what is said to be Webster&#x27;s desk when he takes his seat in the Senate in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939).

<doc id="51614" wikidata="Q2624740" url="?curid=51614" title="Biology and sexual orientation">
<text>The relationship between biology and sexual orientation is a subject of on-going research. While scientists do not know the exact cause of sexual orientation, they theorize that it is caused by a complex interplay of genetic, hormonal, and environmental influences. However, evidence is weak for hypotheses that the post-natal social environment impacts sexual orientation, especially for males.

Biological theories for explaining the causes of sexual orientation are favored by scientists. These factors, which may be related to the development of a sexual orientation, include genes, the early uterine environment (such as prenatal hormones), and brain structure. While the evolutionary explanation for heterosexuality in organisms that reproduce sexually is straightforwardly understood to be a psychological adaptation resulting from greater reproductive success, evolutionary explanations for homosexuality rely upon other mechanisms of evolution such as kin selection and inclusive fitness, or antagonistic pleiotropy that favors heterozygotes causing homosexuality among homozygotes as a by-product.

==Scientific research and studies==

=== Fetal development and hormones ===

The influence of hormones on the developing fetus has been the most influential causal hypothesis of the development of sexual orientation. In simple terms, the developing fetal brain begins in a &quot;female&quot; state. Both INAH3 (third interstitial nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus) area on the left side of the hypothalamus, which stores gender preference, and the center area of the bed stria terminalus (BSTc) area on the right side of the hypothalamus, which stores gender identity, are undeveloped and function as female. The action of the SRY gene in the Y-chromosome in the fetus prompts the development of testes, which release testosterone, the primary androgen receptor-activating hormone, to allow testosterone to enter the cells and masculinize the fetus and fetal brain. If a sufficient amount of testosterone is received by INAH3 at 12 weeks following conception, the testosterone stimulates the enlargement of INAH3, which is known to be involved in directing typical male sex behavior, such as attraction to females. If INAH3 does not receive enough testosterone to override the circulating estrogen, it may not grow to the size typically observed in males. Subsequently, INAH3 may function as female or partially female, potentially causing same-sex attraction to males. Although the &quot;size&quot; of INAH3 in homosexual men compared to heterosexual men may not be statistically different, homosexual men may have a greater cell &quot;density&quot; per unit volume than heterosexual men, though a similar total number of INAH3 neurons.

Studies have shown that INAH3 in gay men has likely been exposed to lower levels of testosterone in the brain compared to straight men, or had different levels of receptivity to its masculinizing effects, or experienced hormone fluctuations at critical times during fetal development. In women, if INAH3 receives more testosterone than is normal for females, INAH3 may enlarge somewhat or even to the size that is normal for males, increasing the likelihood of same sex attraction. Supporting this are studies of the finger digit ratio of the right hand, which is a robust marker of prenatal testosterone exposure . Lesbians tend to have significantly more masculine digit ratios, a finding which has been replicated in numerous cross-cultural studies. Controlled experiments in animals, where scientists manipulate exposure to sex hormones during gestation, can also induce lifelong male-typical behavior and mounting in females, and female-typical behavior in males.

Maternal immune responses during fetal development are strongly demonstrated as causing male homosexuality and bisexuality. Research since the 1990s has demonstrated that as a woman has more sons, there is a higher chance of later born sons being gay. During pregnancy, male cells enter a mother&#x27;s bloodstream, which provoke an immune response to neutralize them. These antibodies are then released on future male fetuses and may neutralize Y-linked antigens, which play a role in brain masculinization, leaving areas of the brain responsible for sexual attraction in the female-typical default position, i.e. expressing attraction to men. Each subsequent son will increase the levels of these antibodies, creating the observed fraternal birth order effect. Biochemical evidence to support this effect was confirmed in a lab study in 2017, finding that mothers with a gay son, particularly those with older brothers, had heightened levels of antibodies to the NLGN4Y Y-protein than mothers with heterosexual sons. This effect is estimated to account for between 15 and 29% of gay men, while other gay and bisexual men are thought to owe sexual orientation to genetic and hormonal interactions.

Socialization theories, which were dominant in the 1900s, favored the idea that children were born &quot;undifferentiated&quot; and were socialized into gender roles and sexual orientation. This led to medical experiments in which newborn and infant boys were surgically reassigned into girls after accidents such as botched circumcisions. These males were then reared and raised as females without telling them, but contrary to expectations, this did not make them feminine nor attracted to men. All published cases providing sexual orientation grew up to be strongly attracted to women. The failure of these experiments demonstrate that socialization effects do not induce feminine sexual behavior or psychology in males, and that the organizational effects of hormones on the fetal brain prior to birth have permanent effects. These indicate the primary role of nature, not post-birth nurture, in the development of male sexual orientation.

In the brain, the sexually dimorphic nucleus of the preoptic area (SDN-POA) is a key region which differs between males and females in humans and a number of mammals (e.g., sheep/rams, mice, rats), and is caused by sex differences in hormone exposure. Also, the INAH-3 region is bigger in males than in females, and is known to be critical for sexual behavior. Dissection studies found that gay men had significantly smaller INAH-3 than heterosexual men, a shift in the female direction, as first demonstrated by neuroscientist Simon LeVay, which has been replicated. Dissection studies are rare, however, due to lack of funding and brain samples.

Long-term studies of homosexual behavior in domesticated sheep led by Charles Roselli have found that 6-8% of rams have a homosexual preference through their life. Dissection of ram brains also found a similar smaller (feminized) structure in homosexually oriented rams in the brain region equivalent to human SDN, the ovine sexually dimorphic nucleus (oSDN). The size of the sheep oSDN has also been demonstrated to be formed in utero, rather than postnatally, underscoring the role of prenatal hormones in masculinization of the brain for sexual attraction.

Other studies in humans have relied on brain imaging technology, such as research led by Ivanka Savic which compared hemispheres of the brain. This research found that straight men had right hemispheres 2% larger than the left, described as modest but &quot;highly significant difference&quot; by LeVay. In heterosexual women, the two hemispheres were the same size. In gay men, the two hemispheres were also the same size, or sex atypical, while in lesbians, the right hemispheres were slightly larger than the left, indicating a small shift in the male direction.

A model proposed by evolutionary geneticist William R. Rice argues that a misexpressed epigenetic modifier of testosterone sensitivity or insensitivity that affected development of the brain can explain homosexuality, and can best explain twin discordance. Rice et al. propose that these epimarks normally canalize sexual development, preventing intersex conditions in most of the population, but sometimes failing to erase across generations and causing reversed sexual preference. On grounds of evolutionary plausibility, Gavrilets, Friberg and Rice argue that all mechanisms for exclusive homosexual orientations likely trace back to their epigenetic model. Testing this hypothesis is possible with current stem cell technology.

=== Prenatal thyroid theory ===

Prenatal thyroid theory of same-sex attraction/gender dysphoria has been based on clinical and developmental observations of youngsters presenting to child psychiatry clinics in Istanbul/Turkey. The report of 12 cases with same-sex attraction/gender dysphoria born to mothers with thyroid diseases was first presented in EPA Congress, Vienna (2015) and published as an article in the same year. The extremely significant relationship between the two conditions suggested an independent model, named as &quot;Prenatal Thyroid Model of Homosexuality&quot;. According to Turkish child &amp; adolescent psychiatrist Osman Sabuncuoglu, who generated the theory, maternal thyroid dysfunction may lead to abnormal deviations from gender-specific development in the offspring. Autoimmune destructive process as seen in Hashimoto&#x27;s thyroiditis, diminished supply of thyroid hormones, and impacts on prenatal androgen system were all considered as contributing mechanisms. In a follow-up theoretical paper, previous research findings indicating higher rates of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in female-to-male transsexuals and lesbian women were conceived as an indication of &quot;Prenatal Thyroid Model&quot; since PCOS and autoimmune thyroiditis are frequently comorbid diseases. Likewise, increased rates of autism spectrum disorder in children born to mothers with thyroid dysfunction and overrepresentation of ASD individuals in gender dysphoria populations suggest such an association. A second group of young children with this pattern were presented in IACAPAP Congress, Prague (2018). Furthermore, 9 additional cases were reported in IACAPAP Congress, Rio de Janeiro (Sabuncuoglu, 2024).

The findings from previous research in LGBT populations had called for attention to be paid to thyroid system. A commentary by Jeffrey Mullen, published shortly after the 2015 article, underlined the importance of &quot;Prenatal Thyroid Model&quot; and supported developments in this field. Afterwards, several authors have emphasized the role of thyroid system in sexuality while citing the &quot;Prenatal Thyroid Model.&quot; Among them, Carosa et al. concluded that thyroid hormones, affecting the human sexual function strongly, the thyroid gland must be considered, along with the genitals and the brain, a sexual organ. As a tertiary source, an authoritative book on the subject of interplay between endocrinology, brain and behavior has also cited the thyroid-homosexuality proposal article in the latest edition.

=== Genetic influences ===
Multiple genes have been found to play a role in sexual orientation. Scientists caution that many people misconstrue the meanings of &quot;genetic&quot; and &quot;environmental&quot;. &quot;Environmental influence&quot; does not automatically imply that the social environment influences or contributes to the development of sexual orientation. Hypotheses for the impact of the post-natal social environment on sexual orientation are weak, especially for males. There is, however, a vast non-social environment that is non-genetic, such as prenatal development, which remains poorly understood.

====Twin studies====
Twin studies are one method of testing genetic and environmental influences, although they cannot reveal what kind of environmental influence this may include (social or non-social). Identical or monozygotic twins share their genes, while fraternal or dizygotic twins are only as genetically similar as any other sibling pair. When twins both share a trait, they are &quot;concordant&quot; for this trait; and when they differ they are &quot;discordant&quot;. If identical twins have a higher rate of concordance for a trait than fraternal twins, it indicates that genes may contribute to the trait.

The 2016 Bailey et al. meta-analysis of all twin studies on sexual orientation found that the median concordance for homosexual or non-heterosexual orientation in twins in unbiased probability samples is 24% for monozygotic identical twins, and 15% for dizygotic twins. According to Rice et al. the identical twin concordance for homosexuality is similar to identical twin concordance for two other traits influenced by prenatal androgens: cryptorchidism and hypospadias (feminized male gonads) which have an identical twin concordance around 25%, despite twins sharing genes and prenatal environments.Twin studies have also found that among twins with differing sexual orientations, homosexual twins were significantly more gender nonconforming than their heterosexual co-twin, and that this was noticeable from a young age. Bailey states:

Identical twins reared apart from birth are another method of studying the origin of psychological traits. Unfortunately, such twin pairs are rare. Three sets of male twin pairs exist in the literature. In the first pair found by Thomas Bouchard, both male twins reared apart from birth were homosexual. In a second pair found by Whitham, both males were also homosexual. In the third pair found by Bouchard, the male twins were neither definitively concordant nor discordant, as both had relations with males and females, thus this pair may be concordant for bisexuality. Among the female twin pairs; four female twin pairs were all discordant, although the small number of cases prevent any strong conclusions.

According to William Rice and colleagues, the concordance of homosexuality among twins raises the possibility that homosexuality is not caused by genes nor atypical levels of hormones, but an epigenetic mechanism controlling how sensitive fetuses are to prenatal hormones.

====Chromosome linkage studies====

Chromosome linkage studies of sexual orientation have indicated the presence of multiple contributing genetic factors throughout the genome. In 1993, Dean Hamer and colleagues published findings from a linkage analysis of a sample of 76 gay brothers and their families. Hamer et al. found that the gay men had more gay male uncles and cousins on the maternal side of the family than on the paternal side. Gay brothers who showed this maternal pedigree were then tested for X chromosome linkage, using twenty-two markers on the X chromosome to test for similar alleles. In another finding, thirty-three of the forty sibling pairs tested were found to have similar alleles in the distal region of Xq28, which was significantly higher than the expected rates of 50% for fraternal brothers. This was popularly dubbed the &quot;gay gene&quot; in the media, causing significant controversy. In 1998, Sanders et al. reported on their similar study, in which they found that 13% of uncles of gay brothers on the maternal side were homosexual, compared with 6% on the paternal side.

A later analysis by Hu et al. replicated and refined the earlier findings. This study revealed that 67% of gay brothers in a new saturated sample shared a marker on the X chromosome at Xq28. Two other studies (Bailey et al., 1999; McKnight and Malcolm, 2000) failed to find a preponderance of gay relatives in the maternal line of homosexual men. One study by Rice et al. in 1999 failed to replicate the Xq28 linkage results. Meta-analysis of all available linkage data indicates a significant link to Xq28, but also indicates that additional genes must be present to account for the full heritability of sexual orientation.

Mustanski et al. (2005) performed a full-genome scan (instead of just an X chromosome scan) on individuals and families previously reported on in Hamer et al. (1993) and Hu et al. (1995), as well as additional new subjects. In the full sample they did not find linkage to Xq28.

Results from the first large, comprehensive multi-center genetic linkage study of male sexual orientation were reported by an independent group of researchers at the American Society of Human Genetics in 2012. The study population included 409 independent pairs of gay brothers, who were analyzed with over 300,000 single-nucleotide polymorphism markers. The data strongly replicated Hamer&#x27;s Xq28 findings as determined by both two-point and multipoint (MERLIN) LOD score mapping. Significant linkage was also detected in the pericentromeric region of chromosome 8, overlapping with one of the regions detected in the Hamer lab&#x27;s previous genomewide study. The authors concluded that &quot;our findings, taken in context with previous work, suggest that genetic variation in each of these regions contributes to development of the important psychological trait of male sexual orientation&quot;. Female sexual orientation does not seem to be linked to Xq28, though it does appear moderately heritable.

In addition to sex chromosomal contribution, a potential autosomal genetic contribution to the development of homosexual orientation has also been suggested. In a study population composed of more than 7000 participants, Ellis et al. (2008) found a statistically significant difference in the frequency of blood type A between homosexuals and heterosexuals. They also found that &quot;unusually high&quot; proportions of homosexual males and homosexual females were Rh negative in comparison to heterosexuals. As both blood type and Rh factor are genetically inherited traits controlled by alleles located on chromosome 9 and chromosome 1 respectively, the study indicates a potential link between genes on autosomes and homosexuality.

The biology of sexual orientation has been studied in detail in several animal model systems. In the common fruit fly &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;, the complete pathway of sexual differentiation of the brain and the behaviors it controls is well established in both males and females, providing a concise model of biologically controlled courtship. In mammals, a group of geneticists at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology bred female mice specifically lacking a particular gene related to sexual behavior. Without the gene, the mice exhibited masculine sexual behavior and attraction toward urine of other female mice. Those mice who retained the gene fucose mutarotase (FucM) were attracted to male mice.

In interviews to the press, researchers have pointed that the evidence of genetic influences should not be equated with genetic determinism. According to Dean Hamer and Michael Bailey, genetic aspects are only one of the multiple causes of homosexuality.

In 2017, &quot;Scientific Reports&quot; published an article with a genome wide association study on male sexual orientation. The research consisted of 1,077 homosexual men and 1,231 heterosexual men. A gene named &quot;SLITRK6&quot; on chromosome 13 was identified. The research supports another study which had been done by the neuroscientist Simon LeVay. LeVay&#x27;s research suggested that the hypothalamus of gay men is different from straight men. The SLITRK6 is active in the mid-brain where the hypothalamus is. The researchers found that the thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) on chromosome 14 shows sequence differences between gay and straight men. Graves&#x27; disease is associated with TSHR abnormalities, with previous research indicating that Graves&#x27; disease is more common in gay men than in straight men. Research indicated that gay people have lower body weight than straight people. It had been suggested that the overactive TSHR hormone lowered body weight in gay people, though this remains unproven.

In 2018, Ganna et al. performed another genome-wide association study on sexual orientation of men and women with data from 26,890 people who had at least one same-sex partner and 450,939 controls. The data in the study was meta-analyzed and obtained from the UK Biobank study and 23andMe. The researchers identified four variants more common in people who reported at least one same-sex experience on chromosomes 7, 11, 12, and 15. The variants on chromosomes 11 and 15 were specific to men, with the variant on chromosome 11 located in an olfactory gene and the variant on chromosome 15 having previously been linked to male-pattern baldness. The four variants were also correlated with mood and mental health disorders; major depressive disorder and schizophrenia in men and women, and bipolar disorder in women. However, none of the four variants could reliably predict sexual orientation.

In August 2019, a genome-wide association study of 493,001 individuals concluded that hundreds or thousands of genetic variants underlie homosexual behavior in both sexes, with 5 variants in particular being significantly associated. Some of these variants had sex-specific effects, and two of these variants suggested links to biological pathways that involve sex hormone regulation and olfaction. All the variants together captured between 8 and 25% of the variation in individual differences in homosexual behavior. These genes partly overlap with those for several other traits, including openness to experience and risk-taking behavior. Additional analyses suggested that sexual behavior, attraction, identity, and fantasies are influenced by a similar set of genetic variants. They also found that the genetic effects that differentiate heterosexual from homosexual behavior are not the same as those that differ among nonheterosexuals with lower versus higher proportions of same-sex partners, which suggests that there is no single continuum from heterosexual to homosexual preference, as suggested by the Kinsey scale.

In October 2021, another research paper reported that genetic factors influence the development of same-sex sexual behavior. A two-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) with a total sample of 1478 homosexual males and 3313 heterosexual males in Han Chinese populations identified two genetic loci (FMR1NB and ZNF536) showing consistent association with male sexual orientation.

===Epigenetics studies===

A study suggests linkage between a mother&#x27;s genetic make-up and homosexuality of her sons. Women have two X chromosomes, one of which is &quot;switched off&quot;. The inactivation of the X chromosome occurs randomly throughout the embryo, resulting in cells that are mosaic with respect to which chromosome is active. In some cases though, it appears that this switching off can occur in a non-random fashion. Bocklandt et al. (2006) reported that, in mothers of homosexual men, the number of women with extreme skewing of X chromosome inactivation is significantly higher than in mothers without gay sons. In a study of 94 participants, 13% of mothers with one gay son, and 23% of mothers with two gay sons, showed extreme skewing, compared to 4% of mothers without gay sons.

===Birth order===

Blanchard and Klassen (1997) reported that each additional older brother increases the odds of a man being gay by 33%. This is now &quot;one of the most reliable epidemiological variables ever identified in the study of sexual orientation&quot;. To explain this finding, it has been proposed that male fetuses provoke a maternal immune reaction that becomes stronger with each successive male fetus. This maternal immunization hypothesis (MIH) begins when cells from a male fetus enter the mother&#x27;s circulation during pregnancy or while giving birth. Male fetuses produce H-Y antigens which are &quot;almost certainly involved in the sexual differentiation of vertebrates&quot;. These Y-linked proteins would not be recognized in the mother&#x27;s immune system because she is female, causing her to develop antibodies which would travel through the placental barrier into the fetal compartment. From here, the anti-male bodies would then cross the blood/brain barrier (BBB) of the developing fetal brain, altering sex-dimorphic brain structures relative to sexual orientation, increasing the likelihood that the exposed son will be more attracted to men than women. It is this antigen which maternal H-Y antibodies are proposed to both react to and &#x27;remember&#x27;. Successive male fetuses are then attacked by H-Y antibodies which somehow decrease the ability of H-Y antigens to perform their usual function in brain masculinization.

In 2017, researchers discovered a biological mechanism of gay people who tend to have older brothers. They believed the Neuroligin 4 Y-linked protein was responsible for a later son being gay. They found that women had significantly higher anti-NLGN4Y levels than men. In addition, mothers of gay sons, particularly those with older brothers, had significantly higher anti-NLGN4Y levels than did the control samples of women, including mothers of heterosexual sons. The results suggest an association between a maternal immune response to NLGN4Y and subsequent sexual orientation in male offspring.

The fraternal birth order effect, however, does not apply to instances where a firstborn is homosexual.

===Pheromone studies===
Research conducted in Sweden has suggested that gay and straight men respond differently to two odors that are believed to be involved in sexual arousal. The research showed that when both heterosexual women and gay men are exposed to a testosterone derivative found in men&#x27;s sweat, a region in the hypothalamus is activated. Heterosexual men, on the other hand, have a similar response to an estrogen-like compound found in women&#x27;s urine. The conclusion is that sexual attraction, whether same-sex or opposite-sex oriented, operates similarly on a biological level. Researchers have suggested that this possibility could be further explored by studying young subjects to see if similar responses in the hypothalamus are found and then correlating these data with adult sexual orientation.

===Studies of brain structure===
A number of sections of the brain have been reported to be sexually dimorphic; that is, they vary between men and women. There have also been reports of variations in brain structure corresponding to sexual orientation. In 1990, Dick Swaab and Michel A. Hofman reported a difference in the size of the suprachiasmatic nucleus between homosexual and heterosexual men. In 1992, Allen and Gorski reported a difference related to sexual orientation in the size of the anterior commissure, but this research was refuted by numerous studies, one of which found that the entirety of the variation was caused by a single outlier.

Research on the physiologic differences between male and female brains are based on the idea that people have male or a female brain, and this mirrors the behavioral differences between the two sexes. Some researchers state that solid scientific support for this is lacking. Although consistent differences have been identified, including the size of the brain and of specific brain regions, male and female brains are very similar.

====Sexually dimorphic nuclei in the anterior hypothalamus====
LeVay also conducted some of these early researches. He studied four groups of neurons in the hypothalamus called INAH1, INAH2, INAH3 and INAH4. This was a relevant area of the brain to study, because of evidence that it played a role in the regulation of sexual behaviour in animals, and because INAH2 and INAH3 had previously been reported to differ in size between men and women.

He obtained brains from 41 deceased hospital patients. The subjects were classified into three groups. The first group comprised 19 gay men who had died of AIDS-related illnesses. The second group comprised 16 men whose sexual orientation was unknown, but whom the researchers presumed to be heterosexual. Six of these men had died of AIDS-related illnesses. The third group was of six women whom the researchers presumed to be heterosexual. One of the women had died of an AIDS-related illness.

The HIV-positive people in the presumably heterosexual patient groups were all identified from medical records as either intravenous drug abusers or recipients of blood transfusions. Two of the men who identified as heterosexual specifically denied ever engaging in a homosexual sex act. The records of the remaining heterosexual subjects contained no information about their sexual orientation; they were assumed to have been primarily or exclusively heterosexual &quot;on the basis of the numerical preponderance of heterosexual men in the population&quot;.

LeVay found no evidence for a difference between the groups in the size of INAH1, INAH2 or INAH4. However, the INAH3 group appeared to be twice as big in the heterosexual male group as in the gay male group; the difference was highly significant, and remained significant when only the six AIDS patients were included in the heterosexual group. The size of INAH3 in the homosexual men&#x27;s brains was comparable to the size of INAH3 in the heterosexual women&#x27;s brains.

William Byne and colleagues attempted to identify the size differences reported in INAH 1–4 by replicating the experiment using brain sample from other subjects: 14 HIV-positive homosexual males, 34 presumed heterosexual males (10 HIV-positive), and 34 presumed heterosexual females (9 HIV-positive). The researchers found a significant difference in INAH3 size between heterosexual men and heterosexual women. The INAH3 size of the homosexual men was apparently smaller than that of the heterosexual men, and larger than that of the heterosexual women, though neither difference quite reached statistical significance.

Byne and colleagues also weighed and counted numbers of neurons in INAH3 tests not carried out by LeVay. The results for INAH3 weight were similar to those for INAH3 size; that is, the INAH3 weight for the heterosexual male brains was significantly larger than for the heterosexual female brains, while the results for the gay male group were between those of the other two groups but not quite significantly different from either. The neuron count also found a male-female difference in INAH3, but found no trend related to sexual orientation.

LeVay has said that Byne replicated his work, but that he employed a two-tailed statistical analysis, which is typically reserved for when no previous findings had employed the difference. LeVay has said that &quot;given that my study had already reported a INAH3 to be smaller in gay men, a one tailed approach would have been more appropriate, and it would have yielded a significant difference [between heterosexual and homosexual men]&quot;.

J. Michael Bailey has criticized LeVay&#x27;s critics—describing the claim that the INAH-3 difference could be attributable to AIDS as &quot;aggravating&quot;, since the &quot;INAH-3 did not differ between the brains of straight men who died of AIDS and those who did not have the disease&quot;. Bailey has further criticized the second objection that was raised, that being gay might have somehow caused the difference in INAH-3, and not vice-versa, saying &quot;the problem with this idea is that the hypothalamus appears to develop early. Not a single expert I have ever asked about LeVay&#x27;s study thought it was plausible that sexual behavior caused the INAH-3 differences.&quot;

The SCN of homosexual males has been demonstrated to be larger (both the volume and the number of neurons are twice as many as in heterosexual males). These areas of the hypothalamus have not yet been explored in homosexual females nor bisexual males nor females. Although the functional implications of such findings still have not been examined in detail, they cast serious doubt over the widely accepted Dörner hypothesis that homosexual males have a &quot;female hypothalamus&quot; and that the key mechanism of differentiating the &quot;male brain from originally female brain&quot; is the epigenetic influence of testosterone during prenatal development.

A 2010 study by Garcia-Falgueras and Swaab stated that &quot;the fetal brain develops during the intrauterine period in the male direction through a direct action of testosterone on the developing nerve cells, or in the female direction through the absence of this hormone surge. In this way, our gender identity (the conviction of belonging to the male or female gender) and sexual orientation are programmed or organized into our brain structures when we are still in the womb. There is no indication that social environment after birth has an effect on gender identity or sexual orientation.&quot;

====Ovine model====
The domestic ram is used as an experimental model to study early programming of the neural mechanisms which underlie homosexuality, developing from the observation that approximately 8% of domestic rams are sexually attracted to other rams (male-oriented) when compared to the majority of rams which are female-oriented. In many species, a prominent feature of sexual differentiation is the presence of a sexually dimorphic nucleus (SDN) in the preoptic hypothalamus, which is larger in males than in females.

Roselli et al. discovered an ovine SDN (oSDN) in the preoptic hypothalamus that is smaller in male-oriented rams than in female-oriented rams, but similar in size to the oSDN of females. Neurons of the oSDN show aromatase expression which is also smaller in male-oriented rams versus female-oriented rams, suggesting that sexual orientation is neurologically hard-wired and may be influenced by hormones. However, results failed to associate the role of neural aromatase in the sexual differentiation of brain and behavior in the sheep, due to the lack of defeminization of adult sexual partner preference or oSDN volume as a result of aromatase activity in the brain of the fetuses during the critical period. Having said this, it is more likely that oSDN morphology and homosexuality may be programmed through an androgen receptor that does not involve aromatisation. Most of the data suggests that homosexual rams, like female-oriented rams, are masculinized and defeminized with respect to mounting, receptivity, and gonadotrophin secretion, but are not defeminized for sexual partner preferences, also suggesting that such behaviors may be programmed differently. Although the exact function of the oSDN is not fully known, its volume, length, and cell number seem to correlate with sexual orientation, and a dimorphism in its volume and of cells could bias the processing cues involved in partner selection. More research is needed in order to understand the requirements and timing of the development of the oSDN and how prenatal programming effects the expression of mate choice in adulthood.

=== Childhood gender nonconformity ===
Childhood gender nonconformity is a strong predictor of adult sexual orientation that has been consistently replicated in research, and is thought to be strong evidence of a biological difference between heterosexual and non-heterosexuals. A review authored by J. Michael Bailey states: &quot;childhood gender nonconformity comprises the following phenomena among boys: cross-dressing, desiring to have long hair, playing with dolls, disliking competitive sports and rough play, preferring girls as playmates, exhibiting elevated separation anxiety, and desiring to be—or believing that one is—a girl. In girls, gender nonconformity comprises dressing like and playing with boys, showing interest in competitive sports and rough play, lacking interest in conventionally female toys such as dolls and makeup, and desiring to be a boy&quot;. This gender nonconformist behavior typically emerges at preschool age, although is often evident as early as age 2. Children are only considered gender nonconforming if they persistently engage in a variety of these behaviors, as opposed to engaging in a behavior on a few times or on occasion. It is also not a one-dimensional trait, but rather has varying degrees.

Children who grow up to be non-heterosexual were, on average, substantially more gender nonconforming in childhood. This is confirmed in both retrospective studies where homosexuals, bisexuals and heterosexuals are asked about their gender typical behavior in childhood, and in prospective studies, where highly gender nonconforming children are followed from childhood into adulthood to find out their sexual orientation. A review of retrospective studies that measured gender nonconforming traits estimated that 89% of homosexual men exceeded heterosexual males level of gender nonconformity, whereas just 2% of heterosexual men exceeded the homosexual median. For female sexual orientation, the figures were 81% and 12% respectively. A variety of other assessments such as childhood home videos, photos and reports of parents also confirm this finding. Critics of this research see this as confirming stereotypes; however, no study has ever demonstrated that this research has exaggerated childhood gender nonconformity. J. Michael Bailey argues that gay men often deny that they were gender nonconforming in childhood because they may have been bullied or maltreated by peers and parents for it, and because they often do not find femininity attractive in other gay males and thus would not want to acknowledge it in themselves. Additional research in Western cultures and non-Western cultures including Latin America, Asia, Polynesia, and the Middle East supports the validity of childhood gender nonconformity as a predictor of adult non-heterosexuality.

This research does not mean that all non-heterosexuals were gender nonconforming, but rather indicates that long before sexual attraction is known, non-heterosexuals, on average, are noticeably different from other children. There is little evidence that gender nonconforming children have been encouraged or taught to behave that way; rather, childhood gender nonconformity typically emerges despite conventional socialization. Medical experiments in which infant boys were sex reassigned and reared as girls did not make them feminine nor attracted to males.

=== Boys who were surgically reassigned female ===
Between the 1960s and 2000, many newborn and infant boys were surgically reassigned as females if they were born with malformed penises, or if they lost their penises in accidents. Many surgeons believed such males would be happier being socially and surgically reassigned female. In all seven published cases that have provided sexual orientation information, the subjects grew up to be attracted to females. Six cases were exclusively attracted to females, with one case &#x27;predominantly&#x27; attracted to females. In a review article in the journal &quot;Psychological Science in the Public Interest,&quot; six researchers including J. Michael Bailey state this establishes a strong case that male sexual orientation is partly established before birth:

They further argue that this raises questions about the significance of the social environment on sexual orientation, stating, &quot;If one cannot reliably make a male human become attracted to other males by cutting off his penis in infancy and rearing him as a girl, then what other psychosocial intervention could plausibly have that effect?&quot; It is further stated that neither cloacal exstrophy (resulting in a malformed penis), nor surgical accidents, are associated with abnormalities of prenatal androgens, thus, the brains of these individuals were male-organized at birth. Six of the seven identified as heterosexual males at follow up, despite being surgically altered and reared as females, with researchers adding: &quot;available evidence indicates that in such instances, parents are deeply committed to raising these children as girls and in as gender-typical a manner as possible.&quot; Bailey et al. describe these sex reassignments as &#x27;the near-perfect quasi-experiment&#x27; in measuring the impact of &#x27;nature&#x27; versus &#x27;nurture&#x27; with regards to male homosexuality.

==Homosexuality and evolution==
===General===
Sexual practices that significantly reduce the frequency of heterosexual intercourse also significantly decrease the chances of successful reproduction, and for this reason, they would appear to be maladaptive in an evolutionary context following a simple Darwinian model (competition amongst individuals) of natural selection—on the assumption that homosexuality would reduce this frequency. Several theories have been advanced to explain this contradiction, and new experimental evidence has demonstrated their feasibility.

===Kin selection===
The &quot;gay uncle hypothesis&quot; posits that people who themselves do not have children may nonetheless increase the prevalence of their family&#x27;s genes in future generations by providing resources (e.g., food, supervision, defense, shelter) to the offspring of their closest relatives.

This hypothesis is an extension of the theory of kin selection, which was originally developed to explain apparent altruistic acts which seemed to be maladaptive. The initial concept was suggested by J. B. S. Haldane in 1932 and later elaborated by many others including John Maynard Smith, W. D. Hamilton, Mary Jane West-Eberhard, and E. O. Wilson. This concept was also used to explain the patterns of certain social insects where most of the members are non-reproductive. Conversely, social psychologist David Buss has argued that there is no empirical evidence that supports the hypothesis.

In 2001, &quot;Evolution and Human Behavior&quot; published a questionnaire survey of 57 heterosexual and 66 homosexual male subjects in the United States that found that homosexual subjects were no more likely to provide financial resources towards family members, heterosexual subjects were more likely give more financial resources to siblings than homosexual subjects, and homosexual subjects tended to be more estranged from family members. In 2005, &quot;Archives of Sexual Behavior&quot; published a replication study with 60 heterosexual and 60 homosexual male subjects in England that likewise found no significant differences between heterosexual and homosexual subjects in familial affinity or generosity towards family members. Vasey, Pocock, and VanderLaan (2007) and Vasey and VanderLaan (2010) tested the theory on the Pacific island of Samoa, where they studied women, straight men, and the &quot;fa&#x27;afafine&quot;, men who prefer other men as sexual partners and are accepted within the culture as a distinct third gender category. Vasey and VanderLaan found that the &quot;fa&#x27;afafine&quot; said they were significantly more willing to help kin, yet much less interested in helping children who are not family, providing the first evidence to support the kin selection hypothesis. The hypothesis is consistent with other studies on homosexuality, which show that it is more prevalent amongst both siblings and twins.

Anthropologist Raymond Hames notes that Vasey and VanderLaan&#x27;s research on the &quot;fa&#x27;afafine&quot; identifies them as &quot;transgendered androphilic males&quot; as opposed to &quot;sex-gender congruent androphiles&quot; or &quot;egalitarian homosexuals&quot; in Western societies. Based on research conducted in Japan that found no evidence that homosexual Japanese men exhibited elevated avuncular tendencies compared to heterosexual counterparts, Vasey and VanderLaan (2011) provides evidence that if an adaptively designed avuncular male androphilic phenotype exists and its development is contingent on a particular social environment, then a collectivistic cultural context is insufficient, in and of itself, for the expression of such a phenotype. In 2011 and 2014, the &quot;Journal of Cognition and Culture&quot; published two studies that found that Canadian homosexual men exhibited significantly greater altruistic tendencies toward kin versus non-kin children relative to heterosexual men and women, but did not find that Canadian homosexual males exhibited significantly higher altruistic behavior towards nieces and nephews over geographic disconnect.

In 2016, the &quot;Journal of Sex Research&quot; published a study comprising 278 homosexual (or &quot;kathoey&quot;) and heterosexual male subjects in Italy and Spain and from the Urak Lawoi of Thailand that found no greater kin altruism or avuncularity among homosexual subjects in any of the three cultures and that kin altruism and avuncularity was associated with societal differences in cultural norms about general altruism toward non-kin children. In 2017, &quot;Evolutionary Psychological Science&quot; published a logistic regression analysis of the results of 17,295 female subjects across 58 countries on World Values Survey questionnaires about attitudes toward homosexuality that found that subjects that were potentially most in need of alloparental support exhibited significantly more positive attitudes towards homosexuals, which the researchers suggested was circumstantial evidence in support of the hypothesis on a global scale. In 2018, &quot;Archives of Sexual Behavior&quot; published a study comparing avuncular tendencies between heterosexual and homosexual men on Java in Indonesia that found that homosexual men reported an increased willingness to transfer resources and money toward nephews and nieces but only reduced the direct reproductive cost to homosexual men by 20%, with the researchers concluding that kin selection alone was an insufficient explanation of male homosexuality.

===Antagonistic pleiotropy===
Some scholars have suggested that homosexuality is indirectly adaptive, by conferring a reproductive advantage on heterosexual siblings or their children. By way of analogy, the allele (a particular version of a gene) which causes sickle cell disease when two copies are present, also confers an adaptive advantage when one copy is present by providing resistance to malaria with non-symptomatic sickle cell trait—which is known as &quot;heterozygote advantage&quot;.

Brendan Zietsch of the Queensland Institute of Medical Research proposes the alternative theory that men exhibiting female traits become more attractive to females and are thus more likely to mate, provided the genes involved do not drive them to complete rejection of heterosexuality.

In a 2008 study, its authors stated that &quot;There is considerable evidence that human sexual orientation is genetically influenced, so it is not known how homosexuality, which tends to lower reproductive success, is maintained in the population at a relatively high frequency.&quot; They hypothesized that &quot;while genes predisposing to homosexuality reduce homosexuals&#x27; reproductive success, they may confer some advantage in heterosexuals who carry them&quot;. Their results suggested that &quot;genes predisposing to homosexuality may confer a mating advantage in heterosexuals, which could help explain the evolution and maintenance of homosexuality in the population&quot;. However, in the same study, the authors noted that &quot;nongenetic alternative explanations cannot be ruled out&quot; as a reason for the heterosexual in the homosexual-heterosexual twin pair having more partners, specifically citing &quot;social pressure on the other twin to act in a more heterosexual way&quot; (and thus seek out a greater number of sexual partners) as an example of one alternative explanation. The study acknowledges that a large number of sexual partners may not lead to greater reproductive success, specifically noting there is an &quot;absence of evidence relating the number of sexual partners and actual reproductive success, either in the present or in our evolutionary past&quot;.

The heterosexual advantage hypothesis was given strong support by the 2004 Italian study demonstrating increased fecundity in the female matrilineal relatives of gay men. As originally pointed out by Dean Hamer, even a modest increase in reproductive capacity in females carrying a &quot;gay gene&quot; could easily account for its maintenance at high levels in the population.

In 2004, Italian researchers conducted a study of about 4,600 people who were the relatives of 98 homosexual and 100 heterosexual men. Female relatives of the homosexual men tended to have more offspring than those of the heterosexual men. Female relatives of the homosexual men on their mother&#x27;s side tended to have more offspring than those on the father&#x27;s side. The researchers concluded that there was genetic material being passed down on the X chromosome which both promote fertility in the mother and homosexuality in her male offspring. The connections discovered would explain about 20% of the cases studied, indicating that it being a highly significant factor to account for, but not the sole genetic factor determining sexual orientation. A 2008 follow-up study using a comparative survey design found that 147 white and non-white homosexual men had a significantly more relatives in their maternal lines than 155 heterosexual men but not in the paternal line, and while the maternal aunts of white homosexual men had significantly elevated fecundity as compared to white heterosexual men, every class of relative for non-white heterosexual men showed elevated fecundities as compared to non-white homosexual men.

Noting subsequent research by the original researchers that found that female relatives in the maternal line of homosexual men have higher fertility, anthropologist Ruth Mace suggests that homosexuality is maintained by antagonistic pleiotropy and cites a cross-cultural study spanning 48 societies that found that male homosexuality was more prevalent in stratified societies, did not appear to be a cultural universal, and is possibly maintained by hypergyny. While the original cross-cultural study&#x27;s empirical findings, conceptual basis, and methodology has been disputed by other researchers, a subsequent cross-cultural study of 107 societies across 6 continents replicated the previous study&#x27;s findings.

In 2005, &quot;Archives of Sexual Behavior&quot; published a study comparing family size and fecundity among family relatives between 301 homosexual men and 404 heterosexual men and found that the mean family size for homosexual men was significantly larger than heterosexual men as well as increased fecundity among the relatives of homosexual men. In 2007, the &quot;Proceedings of the Royal Society: Series B&quot; published a study comparing the number of siblings of a sample of Samoan heterosexual males to &quot;fa&#x27;afafine&quot; counterparts that found that the &quot;fa&#x27;afafine&quot; tend to have more siblings, and specifically, a greater number of older brothers, older sisters, and younger brothers, and &quot;Archives of Sexual Behavior&quot; published a replication study in 2011 that found that likewise showed that the &quot;fa&#x27;afafine&quot; had a greater number of siblings than heterosexual males, which the researchers suggested indicates that a maternal fecundity effect exists in Samoa. In 2009, &quot;Archives of Sexual Behavior&quot; published a study that examined the probands of 152 homosexual men and 98 heterosexual men that found a significant fecundity increase in mothers (including primiparous mothers) but no evidence of increased paternal fecundity, which the researchers concluded suggested the existence of a sexually antagonistic inheritance partly linked to the X-chromosome promoting fecundity in females and homosexual sexual orientation in males.

In 2009, the &quot;Journal of Sexual Medicine&quot; published a study of 151 homosexual or bisexual men and 88 exclusively heterosexual men that found that significantly higher fecundity of female relatives of the maternal line (including mothers, maternal grandparents, and maternal aunts) for both bisexuals and homosexuals compared to the corresponding relatives of heterosexual subjects, which the researchers argued provided evidence for an association between X-chromosomal genetic factors with bisexuality in men and fecundity promotion in female carriers. In 2010, &quot;Archives of Sexual Behavior&quot; published a study comparing the pedigree sizes of 694 homosexual men and 894 heterosexual men sampled at pride parades that found that homosexual men had more relatives, especially paternal relatives, but no evidence that male sexual orientation is transmitted predominantly through the maternal line—which the researchers noted was contrary to previous research. In 2012, &quot;Archives of Sexual Behavior&quot; published a study that compared the probands of 4,784 firstborn homosexual men and 40,197 first-born heterosexual men across 6 datasets that found that the homosexual probands had significantly fewer siblings or a statistically insignificant difference in the number of siblings—which the researcher concluded was a direct contradiction of an antagonistic pleiotropy explanation of homosexuality, but also that such an explanation could not be tested solely by comparing the number of siblings of heterosexual and homosexual subjects because of the confounding impact of the fraternal birth order effect.

In 2012, &quot;PLOS One&quot; published a study that compared the fecundity of the paternal and maternal line grandmothers, aunts, and uncles of 86 Samoan heterosexual males and 86 &quot;fa&#x27;afafine&quot; that found elevated fecundity in the paternal and maternal line grandmothers of &quot;fa&#x27;afafine&quot; but not their aunts or uncles. In 2012, the &quot;Journal of Sexual Medicine&quot; published a study examining the phenotypic expression of the genetic factors that influence increased fecundity in female relative carriers that found that as compared with corresponding female relatives of heterosexual men, mothers and maternal aunts of homosexual men had fewer gynecological disorders and complicated pregnancies, had reduced family stability and a higher divorce and spousal separation rate, and self-reported less interest in having children, less emphasis on romantic love within couples, and less importance on their social life, but scored higher on the extraversion scale of a Big Five personality traits questionnaire.

In 2017, &quot;Archives of Sexual Behavior&quot; published a study investigating differences in fertility rates of the paternal and maternal biological relatives of 191 &quot;fa&#x27;afafine&quot; and 191 homosexual Samoan male subjects that found that the mothers and maternal grandmothers of &quot;fa&#x27;afafine&quot; showed elevated fertility as compared with homosexual men but not for paternal grandmothers or aunts, which led the researchers to conclude that their findings in Samoa for an antagonistic pleiotropy explanation of homosexuality provided only equivocal support. In 2018, &quot;Human Nature&quot; published a study investigating the fecundity among 30,203 relatives of 650 homosexual or bisexual women as compared with 808 heterosexual women that found that the direct fitness of homosexual females was four times lower than that of heterosexual females, but that the pedigree size and relative average fecundity in both the paternal and maternal sides of the families of the homosexual women were significantly higher than the families of the heterosexual women—which the researchers suggested appeared to offset the loss in fitness.

In 2020, &quot;Archives of Sexual Behavior&quot; published a study that investigated fecundity among the relatives of 115 transgendered men and 112 homosexual men in the Isthmus Zapotec culture of Mexico (whom the Isthmus Zapotec refer to as &quot;muxe gunaa&quot; and the &quot;muxe nguiiu&quot; respectively) as compared with 171 heterosexual men and found that the mothers and paternal aunts of the transgendered men had higher fecundity than those of homosexual and heterosexual men, but found no such differences between the families of the heterosexual men and the homosexual men. In 2020, the &quot;Proceedings of the Royal Society: Series B&quot; published a meta-analysis of 10 studies comprising 5,390 homosexual and heterosexual subjects across 14 samples that found evidence for a fraternal birth order effect but no evidence for a female fecundity effect (i.e. an association between higher maternal fertility and homosexual orientation among male offspring) using a mathematical model proposed by mathematician Tanya Khovanova, but the reviewers noted that Khovanova&#x27;s methodology restricted samples to one-son and two-son families which resulted in lost data and possibly biased results, and also made the assumption that female offspring could be ignored for simplicity and clarity while the female fecundity effect is specified in terms of total offspring rather than male offspring exclusively.

In 2022, the &quot;Journal of Sex Research&quot; published a study of 26,542 men and 33,534 women that had entered same-sex unions in the Netherlands as compared with 4,607,785 men and 4,405,635 women that found robust evidence of a fraternal birth order effect on both male and female homosexuality and no support for a female fecundity effect, but the researchers qualified that their findings could be a result of sampling through a same-sex unions registry and only considered maternal siblings rather than other female relatives (e.g. sisters, maternal aunts, maternal grandmothers), and as such, that the existence of a female fecundity effect could not be discounted. In 2024, &quot;Archives of Sexual Behavior&quot; published a study comparing the fertility of the parents and grandparents of 459 homosexual men and 79 homosexual women to 7,312 heterosexual men and 3,352 heterosexual women in the Czech Republic that found higher fertility for only the paternal grandmothers of homosexual men and with a small effect size, leading the researchers to conclude that their findings did not support an antagonistic pleiotropy explanation of homosexuality.

In 2021, &quot;Nature Human Behaviour&quot; published a study that used the results from a pair of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that found that opposite-sex behavior individuals that were carriers of genetic variants associated with same-sex behavior had a greater number of opposite-sex sexual partners on average, and that computer simulations suggested that such a mating advantage could explain the maintenance of such genetic variants in human populations. In 2024, &quot;Science Advances&quot; published a GWAS study that found that only the genetic variants associated with male bisexual behavior to be associated with greater offspring while the genetic variants associated with exclusive same-sex behavior were negatively associated with the number of offspring. In 2025, &quot;Trends in Genetics&quot; published a review analyzing the two studies that concluded that the evolutionary explanation of the persistence of genetic variants associated with same-sex behavior despite apparent fitness costs remained uncertain, but that antagonistic pleiotropy is a plausible persistence mechanism.

==Biological differences in gay men and lesbian women==

Some studies have found correlations between physiology of people and their sexuality; these studies provide evidence which suggests that:

* Gay men and straight women have, on average, equally proportioned brain hemispheres. Lesbian women and straight men have, on average, slightly larger right brain hemispheres.
* The suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus was found by Swaab and Hopffman to be larger in gay men than in non-gay men; the suprachiasmatic nucleus is also known to be larger in men than in women.
* Gay men report, on average, slightly longer and thicker penises than non-gay men.
* The average size of the INAH 3 in the brains of gay men is approximately the same size as INAH 3 in women, which is significantly smaller, and the cells more densely packed, than in heterosexual men&#x27;s brains.
* The anterior commissure was found to be larger in gay men than women and heterosexual men, but a subsequent study found no such difference.
* The functioning of the inner ear and the central auditory system in lesbians and bisexual women are more like the functional properties found in men than in non-gay women (the researchers argued this finding was consistent with the prenatal hormonal theory of sexual orientation).
* The startle response (eyeblink following a loud sound) is similarly masculinized in lesbians and bisexual women.
* Gay and non-gay people&#x27;s brains respond differently to two putative sex pheromones (AND, found in male armpit secretions, and EST, found in female urine).
* The amygdala, a region of the brain, is more active in gay men than non-gay men when exposed to sexually arousing material.
* Finger length ratios between the index and ring fingers have been reported to differ, on average, between non-gay and lesbian women.
* Gay men and lesbians are significantly more likely to be left-handed or ambidextrous than non-gay men and women; Simon LeVay argues that because &quot;[h]and preference is observable before birth... [t]he observation of increased non-right-handness in gay people is therefore consistent with the idea that sexual orientation is influenced by prenatal processes,&quot; perhaps heredity.
* Gay men have increased ridge density in the fingerprints on their left thumbs and little fingers.
* Length of limbs and hands of gay men is smaller compared to height than the general population, but only among white men.
J. Michael Bailey has argued that the early childhood gender nonconforming behavior of homosexuals, as opposed to biological markers, are better evidence of homosexuality being an inborn trait. He argues that gay men are &quot;punished much more than rewarded&quot; for their childhood gender nonconformity, and that such behavior &quot;emerges with no encouragement, and despite opposition&quot;, making it &quot;the sine qua non of innateness&quot;.

==Political aspects==

Whether genetic or other physiological or psychological determinants form the basis of sexual orientation is a highly politicized issue. &quot;The Advocate&quot;, a U.S. gay and lesbian newsmagazine, reported in 1996 that 61% of its readers believed that &quot;it would mostly help gay and lesbian rights if homosexuality were found to be biologically determined&quot;. A cross-national study in the United States, the Philippines, and Sweden found that those who believed that &quot;homosexuals are born that way&quot; held significantly more positive attitudes toward homosexuality than those who believed that &quot;homosexuals choose to be that way&quot; or &quot;learn to be that way&quot;.

The Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution and the Due Process Clause of the 5th Amendment by reverse incorporation requires that when the federal or state governments create a classification for a group suspected of being discriminated against, eligibility for heightened scrutiny is based on several factors including immutability. Evidence that sexual orientation is biologically determined (and therefore perhaps immutable in the legal sense) would strengthen the legal case for heightened scrutiny of laws discriminating on that basis. In &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot; (2015), the Supreme Court of the United States held that the Equal Protection Clause requires state governments to license same-sex marriages and recognize same-sex marriages performed by other state governments citing an &quot;amicus curiae&quot; brief that argued that sexual orientation is immutable which was jointly filed by the American Psychological Association, the American Psychiatric Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy, the National Association of Social Workers, the American Psychoanalytic Association, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the American Medical Association.

The perceived causes of sexual orientation have a significant bearing on the status of sexual minorities in the eyes of social conservatives. The Family Research Council, a conservative Christian think tank in Washington, D.C., argues in the book &quot;Getting It Straight&quot; that finding people are born gay &quot;would advance the idea that sexual orientation is an innate characteristic, like race; that homosexuals, like African-Americans, should be legally protected against &#x27;discrimination;&#x27; and that disapproval of homosexuality should be as socially stigmatized as racism. However, it is not true.&quot; On the other hand, some social conservatives such as Reverend Robert Schenck have argued that people can accept any scientific evidence while still morally opposing homosexuality. National Organization for Marriage board member and fiction writer Orson Scott Card has supported biological research on homosexuality, writing that &quot;our scientific efforts in regard to homosexuality should be to identify genetic and uterine causes... so that the incidence of this dysfunction can be minimized... [However, this should not be seen] as an attack on homosexuals, a desire to &#x27;commit genocide&#x27; against the homosexual community... There is no &#x27;cure&#x27; for homosexuality because it is not a disease. There are, however, different ways of living with homosexual desires.&quot;

Some advocates for the rights of sexual minorities resist what they perceive as attempts to pathologise or medicalise &#x27;deviant&#x27; sexuality, and choose to fight for acceptance in a moral or social realm. The journalist Chandler Burr has stated that &quot;[s]ome, recalling earlier psychiatric &quot;treatments&quot; for homosexuality, discern in the biological quest the seeds of genocide. They conjure up the specter of the surgical or chemical &quot;rewiring&quot; of gay people, or of abortions of fetal homosexuals who have been hunted down in the womb.&quot; LeVay has said in response to letters from gays and lesbians making such criticisms that the research &quot;has contributed to the status of gay people in society&quot;.

<text>The Montgolfier brothers – Joseph-Michel Montgolfier (; 26 August 1740 – 26 June 1810) and Jacques-Étienne Montgolfier (; 6 January 1745 – 2 August 1799) – were aviation pioneers, balloonists and paper manufacturers from the commune Annonay in Ardèche, France. They invented the Montgolfière-style hot air balloon, globe aérostatique, which launched the first confirmed piloted ascent by humans in 1783, carrying Jacques-Étienne.

Joseph-Michel also invented the self-acting hydraulic ram (1796) and Jacques-Étienne founded the first paper-making vocational school. Together, the brothers invented a process to manufacture transparent paper.

==Early years==

Joseph-Michel and Jacques-Étienne Montgolfier were born into a family of paper manufacturers. Their parents were Pierre Montgolfier (1700–1793) and Anne Duret (1701–1760), who had 16 children. Pierre Montgolfier established his eldest son, Raymond (1730–1772), as his successor.

Joseph-Michel was the 12th child. Described as a maverick and dreamer, he was impractical in terms of business and personal affairs. Étienne was the 15th child, had a much more even and businesslike temperament and was sent to Paris to train as an architect. After the sudden and unexpected death of Raymond in 1772, he was recalled to Annonay to run the family business. In the subsequent 10 years, Étienne applied his talent for technical innovation to the family business of paper making, which then as now was a high-tech industry. He succeeded in incorporating the latest Dutch innovations of the day into the family mills.

==Hot air balloon experiments, 1782–84==
===Hot air balloon experiments, 1782===

Of the two brothers, it was Joseph who was first interested in aeronautics; as early as 1775 he built parachutes, and once jumped from the family house. He first contemplated building machines when he observed laundry drying over a fire incidentally form pockets that billowed upwards. Joseph made his first definitive experiments in November 1782 while living in Avignon. He reported some years later that he was watching a fire one evening while contemplating one of the great military issues of the day—an assault on the fortress of Gibraltar, which had proved impregnable from both sea and land. Joseph mused on the possibility of an air assault using troops lifted by the same force that was lifting the embers from the fire. He believed that the smoke itself was the buoyant part and contained within it a special gas, which he called &quot;Montgolfier Gas&quot;, with a special property he called levity, which is why he preferred smoldering fuel.

Joseph then built a box-like chamber out of very thin wood, and covered the sides and top with lightweight taffeta cloth. He crumpled and lit some paper under the bottom of the box. The contraption quickly lifted off its stand and collided with the ceiling.

Joseph recruited his brother to balloon building by writing, &quot;Get in a supply of taffeta and of cordage, quickly, and you will see one of the most astonishing sights in the world.&quot; The two brothers built a similar device, three times larger having a volume 27 times greater. On 14 December 1782 they conducted their first test flight, using ignited wool and hay as fuel. The lifting force was so great that they lost control of their craft. The device floated nearly but was destroyed after landing by the &quot;indiscretion&quot; of a bypasser.

===Public demonstrations, summer 1783===
To make a public demonstration and to claim its invention the brothers constructed a globe-shaped balloon of sackcloth tightened with three thin layers of paper inside. The envelope could contain nearly of air and weighed . It was constructed of four pieces (the dome and three lateral bands) and held together by 1,800 buttons. A reinforcing fish net of cord covered the outside of the envelope.

On 4 June 1783, they flew the balloon at Annonay in front of a group of dignitaries from the &quot;états particuliers&quot;. The flight covered , lasted 10 minutes, and had an estimated altitude of . Word of their success quickly reached Paris. Étienne went to the capital to make further demonstrations and to solidify the brothers&#x27; claim to the invention of flight. Joseph, given his unkempt appearance and shyness, remained with the family. Étienne was &quot;the epitome of sober virtues ... modest in clothes and manner...&quot;
In collaboration with the wallpaper manufacturer Jean-Baptiste Réveillon, Étienne constructed a envelope of taffeta coated with a varnish of alum for fireproofing. The balloon was sky blue and decorated with golden flourishes, signs of the zodiac, and suns. The design showed the intervention of Réveillon. The next test was on 11 September from the grounds of &quot;la Folie Titon&quot;, close to Réveillon&#x27;s house. There was some concern about the effects of flight into the upper atmosphere on living creatures. The king proposed to launch two convicted criminals, but it is most likely that the inventors decided to send a sheep, a duck, and a rooster aloft first.

On 19 September 1783, the &quot;Aérostat Réveillon&quot; was flown with the first living beings in a basket attached to the balloon: a sheep called Montauciel (&quot;Climb-to-the-sky&quot;), a duck and a rooster. The sheep was believed to have a reasonable approximation of human physiology. The duck was expected to be unharmed by being lifted and was included as a control for effects created by the aircraft rather than the altitude. The rooster was included as a further control as it was a bird that did not fly at high altitudes. The demonstration was performed at the royal palace in Versailles, before King Louis XVI of France and Queen Marie Antoinette and a crowd. The flight lasted approximately eight minutes, covered , and obtained an altitude of about . The craft landed safely after flying.

===Piloted flight, autumn 1783===
Since the animals survived, the king allowed flights with humans. Again in collaboration with Réveillon, Étienne built a balloon for the purpose of making flights with humans. It was about tall and about in diameter. Réveillon supplied rich decorative touches of gold figures on a deep blue background, including fleur-de-lis, signs of the zodiac, and suns with Louis XVI&#x27;s face in the center interlaced with the royal monogram in the central section. Red and blue drapery and golden eagles were at the base of the balloon. Étienne Montgolfier was the first human to lift off the Earth in a balloon, making a tethered test flight from the yard of the Réveillon workshop in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, most likely on 15 October 1783. A little while later on that same day, physicist Pilâtre de Rozier became the second to ascend into the air, to an altitude of , which was the length of the tether.
On 21 November 1783, the first free flight by humans was made by Pilâtre de Rozier, together with an army officer, the marquis d&#x27;Arlandes. The flight began from the grounds of the Château de la Muette close to the Bois de Boulogne park in the western outskirts of Paris. They flew about above Paris for a distance of nine kilometers. After 25 minutes, the balloon landed between the windmills, outside the city ramparts, on the Butte-aux-Cailles. Enough fuel remained on board at the end of the flight to have allowed the balloon to fly four to five times as far. However, burning embers from the fire were scorching the balloon fabric and had to be daubed out with sponges. As it appeared it could destroy the balloon, Pilâtre took off his coat to stop the fire.

The early flights made a sensation. During those first few years, numerous items, such as fans, furniture, handkerchiefs, pencil boxes, umbrella tops, etc., could be found with ballooning images engraved on them. Some items would be celebrating specific ballooning events, while others would be celebrating ballooning itself.

In December 1783, father Pierre Montgolfier was elevated to the nobility and the hereditary appellation of de Montgolfier by King Louis XVI of France. 
===Other balloons, competing claims===

Some claim that the hot air balloon was invented about 74 years earlier by the Brazilian/Portuguese priest Bartolomeu de Gusmão. A description of his invention was published in 1709(?) in Vienna, and another one was found in the Vatican in about 1917. However, this claim is not generally recognized by aviation historians outside the Portuguese-speaking community, in particular the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale.

On 1 December 1783, a few months after the Montgolfiers&#x27; first flight, Jacques Alexandre César Charles rose to an altitude of about near Paris in a hydrogen-filled balloon he had developed.

In early 1784, the Flesselles balloon, named after the unfortunate Jacques de Flesselles, later to be an early casualty at the Bastille, gave a rough landing to its passengers.

In June 1784, the &quot;Gustave&quot; (a hot air balloon christened &quot;La Gustave&quot; in honour of King Gustav III of Sweden&#x27;s visit to Lyon) saw the first female aeronaut, Élisabeth Thible.

==Other Montgolfier inventions==

Both brothers invented a process to manufacture transparent paper similar to vellum, imitating the technique of the English, followed by the papermakers Johannot and Réveillon. In 1796, Joseph Michel Montgolfier invented the first self-acting hydraulic ram, a water pump to raise water for his paper mill at Voiron. In 1772, the British clockmaker John Whitehurst had invented its precursor, the &quot;pulsation engine&quot;. In 1797, Montgolfier&#x27;s friend Matthew Boulton took out a British patent on his behalf.

In 1816, Joseph Michel&#x27;s sons obtained a British patent for an improved version of the pump.

==Death, the Montgolfier company==
Both brothers were freemasons in Les Neuf Soeurs lodge in Paris.

In 1799, Etienne de Montgolfier died on the way from Lyon to Annonay. His son-in-law, Barthélémy Barou de la Lombardière de Canson (1774–1859), succeeded him as the head of the company, thanks to his marriage with Alexandrine de Montgolfier. The company became Montgolfier et Canson in 1801, then Canson-Montgolfier in 1807. In 1810, Joseph-Michel died in Balaruc-les-Bains.

The Montgolfier Company in Annonay still exists under the name Canson. It produces fine art papers, school drawing papers and digital fine art and photography papers sold in 150 countries.

In 1983, the Montgolfier brothers were inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum.

<text>Thomas Young FRS (13 June 177310 May 1829) was a British polymath who made notable contributions to the fields of vision, light, solid mechanics, energy, physiology, language, musical harmony, and Egyptology. He was instrumental in the decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphs, specifically the Rosetta Stone.

Young has been described as &quot;The Last Man Who Knew Everything&quot;. His work influenced that of William Herschel, Hermann von Helmholtz, James Clerk Maxwell, and Albert Einstein. Young is credited with establishing Christiaan Huygens&#x27; wave theory of light, in contrast to the corpuscular theory of Isaac Newton. Young&#x27;s work was subsequently supported by the work of Augustin-Jean Fresnel.

==Personal life==
Young belonged to a Quaker family of Milverton, Somerset, where he was born in 1773, the eldest of ten children. By the age of fourteen, Young had learned Greek, Latin, French, Italian, Syriac, Samaritan Hebrew, Arabic, Biblical Aramaic, Persian, Turkish, and Ge&#x27;ez.

Young began to study medicine in London at St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital in 1792, moved to the University of Edinburgh Medical School in 1794, and a year later went to Göttingen, Lower Saxony, Germany, where he obtained the degree of doctor of medicine in 1796 from the University of Göttingen. In 1797 he entered Emmanuel College, Cambridge. In the same year he inherited the estate of his grand-uncle, Richard Brocklesby, which made him financially independent, and in 1799 he established himself as a physician at 48 Welbeck Street, London (now recorded with a blue plaque). Young published many of his first academic articles anonymously to protect his reputation as a physician.

In 1801, Young was appointed professor of natural philosophy (mainly physics) at the Royal Institution. In two years, he delivered 91 lectures. In 1802, he was appointed foreign secretary of the Royal Society, of which he had been elected a fellow in 1794. He resigned his professorship in 1803, fearing that its duties would interfere with his medical practice. His lectures were published in 1807 in the &quot;Course of Lectures on Natural Philosophy&quot; and contain a number of anticipations of later theories.

In 1811, Young became physician to St George&#x27;s Hospital, and in 1814 he served on a committee appointed to consider the dangers involved in the general introduction of gas for lighting into London. In 1816 he was secretary of a commission charged with ascertaining the precise length of the seconds pendulum (the length of a pendulum whose period is exactly 2 seconds), and in 1818 he became secretary to the Board of Longitude and superintendent of the HM Nautical Almanac Office.

Young was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1822. A few years before his death he became interested in life insurance, and in 1827 he was chosen as one of the eight foreign associates of the French Academy of Sciences. In the same year he became a first class corresponding member, living abroad, of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands. In 1828, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

In 1804, Young married Eliza Maxwell. They had no children.

Young died in his 56th year in London on 10 May 1829, having suffered recurrent attacks of &quot;asthma&quot;. His autopsy revealed atherosclerosis of the aorta. His body was buried in the graveyard of St. Giles Church at Farnborough, in the county of Kent. Westminster Abbey houses a white marble tablet in memory of Young, bearing an epitaph by Hudson Gurney:

Young was highly regarded by his friends and colleagues. He was said never to impose his knowledge, but if asked was able to answer even the most difficult scientific question with ease. Although very learned he had a reputation for sometimes having difficulty in communicating his knowledge. It was said by one of his contemporaries that, &quot;His words were not those in familiar use, and the arrangement of his ideas seldom the same as those he conversed with. He was therefore worse calculated than any man I ever knew for the communication of knowledge.&quot;

=== Religious views ===
Though he sometimes dealt with religious topics of history in Egypt and wrote about the history of Christianity in Nubia, not much is known about Young&#x27;s personal religious views. On George Peacock&#x27;s account, Young never spoke to him about morals, metaphysics or religion, though according to Young&#x27;s wife, his attitudes showed that &quot;his Quaker upbringing had strongly influenced his religious practices.&quot; Authoritative sources have described Young in terms of a cultural Christian Quaker.

Hudson Gurney informed that before his marriage, Young had to join the Church of England, and was baptized later. Gurney stated that Young &quot;retained a good deal of his old creed, and carried to his scriptural studies his habit of inquisition of languages and manners,&quot; rather than the habit of proselytism. Yet, the day before his death, Young participated in religious sacraments; as reported in David Brewster&#x27;s &quot;Edinburgh Journal of Science&quot;: &quot;After some information concerning his affairs, and some instructions concerning the hierographical papers in his hands, he said that, perfectly aware of his situation, he had taken the sacraments of the church on the day preceding. His religious sentiments were by himself stated to be liberal, though orthodox. He had extensively studied the Scriptures, of which the precepts were deeply impressed upon his mind from his earliest years; and he evidenced the faith which he professed; in an unbending course of usefulness and rectitude.&quot;

==Research==
===Wave theory of light===

In Young&#x27;s own judgment, of his many achievements the most important was to establish the wave theory of light set out by Christiaan Huygens in his &quot;Treatise on Light&quot; (1690). To do so, he had to overcome the century-old view, expressed in the venerable Newton&#x27;s &quot;Opticks&quot;, that light is a particle. Nevertheless, in the early 19th century Young put forth a number of theoretical reasons supporting the wave theory of light, and he developed two enduring demonstrations to support this viewpoint. With the ripple tank he demonstrated the idea of interference in the context of water waves. With Young&#x27;s interference experiment, the predecessor of the double-slit experiment, he demonstrated interference in the context of light as a wave.

Young, speaking on 24 November 1803, to the Royal Society of London, began his now-classic description of the historic experiment:
In his subsequent paper, titled &quot;Experiments and Calculations Relative to Physical Optics&quot; (1804), Young describes an experiment in which he placed a card measuring approximately in a beam of light from a single opening in a window and observed the fringes of colour in the shadow and to the sides of the card. He observed that placing another card in front or behind the narrow strip so as to prevent the light beam from striking one of its edges caused the fringes to disappear. This supported the contention that light is composed of waves.

Young performed and analysed a number of experiments, including interference of light from reflection off nearby pairs of micrometre grooves, from reflection off thin films of soap and oil, and from Newton&#x27;s rings. He also performed two important diffraction experiments using fibres and long narrow strips. In his &quot;Course of Lectures on Natural Philosophy and the Mechanical Arts&quot; (1807) he gives Grimaldi credit for first observing the fringes in the shadow of an object placed in a beam of light. Within ten years, much of Young&#x27;s work was reproduced and then extended by Augustin-Jean Fresnel.

===Young&#x27;s modulus===

Young described the characterization of elasticity that came to be known as Young&#x27;s modulus, denoted as &quot;E&quot;, in 1807, and further described it in his &quot;Course of Lectures on Natural Philosophy and the Mechanical Arts&quot;.
However, the first use of the concept of Young&#x27;s modulus in experiments was by Giordano Riccati in 1782—predating Young by 25 years.
Furthermore, the idea can be traced to a paper by Leonhard Euler published in 1727, some 80 years before Thomas Young&#x27;s 1807 paper.

The Young&#x27;s modulus relates the stress (pressure) in a body to its associated strain (change in length as a ratio of the original length); that is, stress = &quot;E&quot; × strain, for a uniaxially loaded specimen. Young&#x27;s modulus is independent of the component under investigation; that is, it is an inherent material property (the term modulus refers to an inherent material property). Young&#x27;s Modulus allowed, for the first time, prediction of the strain in a component subject to a known stress (and vice versa). Prior to Young&#x27;s contribution, engineers were required to apply Hooke&#x27;s F = kx relationship to identify the deformation (x) of a body subject to a known load (F), where the constant (k) is a function of both the geometry and material under consideration. Finding k required physical testing for any new component, as the F = kx relationship is a function of both geometry and material. Young&#x27;s Modulus depends only on the material, not its geometry, thus allowing a revolution in engineering strategies.

Young&#x27;s problems in sometimes not expressing himself clearly were shown by his own definition of the modulus: &quot;The modulus of the elasticity of any substance is a column of the same substance, capable of producing a pressure on its base which is to the weight causing a certain degree of compression as the length of the substance is to the diminution of its length.&quot; When this explanation was put to the Lords of the Admiralty, their clerk wrote to Young saying &quot;Though science is much respected by their Lordships and your paper is much esteemed, it is too learned ... in short it is not understood.&quot;

===Vision and colour theory===
Young has also been called the founder of physiological optics. In 1793 he explained the mode in which the eye accommodates itself to vision at different distances as depending on change of the curvature of the crystalline lens; in 1801 he was the first to describe astigmatism; and in his lectures he presented the hypothesis, afterwards developed by Hermann von Helmholtz, (the Young–Helmholtz theory), that colour perception depends on the presence in the retina of three kinds of nerve fibres. This foreshadowed the modern understanding of colour vision, in particular the finding that the eye does indeed have three colour receptors which are sensitive to different wavelength ranges.

===Young–Laplace equation===
In 1804, Young developed the theory of capillary phenomena on the principle of surface tension. He also observed the constancy of the angle of contact of a liquid surface with a solid, and showed how from these two principles to deduce the phenomena of capillary action. In 1805, Pierre-Simon Laplace, the French philosopher, discovered the significance of meniscus radii with respect to capillary action.

In 1830, Carl Friedrich Gauss, the German mathematician, unified the work of these two scientists to derive the Young–Laplace equation, the formula that describes the capillary pressure difference sustained across the interface between two static fluids.

Young was the first to define the term &quot;energy&quot; in the modern sense. He also did work on the theory of tides paralleling that of Laplace and anticipating more well-known work by Airy.

===Young&#x27;s equation and Young–Dupré equation===

Young&#x27;s equation describes the contact angle of a liquid drop on a plane solid surface as a function of the surface free energy, the interfacial free energy and the surface tension of the liquid. Young&#x27;s equation was developed further some 60 years later by Dupré to account for thermodynamic effects, and this is known as the Young–Dupré equation.

===Medicine===
In physiology Young made an important contribution to haemodynamics in the Croonian lecture for 1808 on the &quot;Functions of the Heart and Arteries,&quot; where he derived a formula for the wave speed of the pulse and his medical writings included &quot;An Introduction to Medical Literature&quot;, including a &quot;System of Practical Nosology&quot; (1813) and &quot;A Practical and Historical Treatise on Consumptive Diseases&quot; (1815).

Young devised a rule of thumb for determining a child&#x27;s drug dosage. Young&#x27;s Rule states that the child dosage is equal to the adult dosage multiplied by the child&#x27;s age in years, divided by the sum of 12 plus the child&#x27;s age.

===Languages===
In an appendix to his 1796 Göttingen dissertation &quot;De corporis hvmani viribvs conservatricibvs&quot; there are four pages added proposing a universal phonetic alphabet (so as &#x27;not to leave these pages blank&#x27;; lit.: &quot;Ne vacuae starent hae paginae, libuit e praelectione ante disputationem habenda tabellam literarum vniuersalem raptim describere&quot;). It includes 16 &quot;pure&quot; vowel symbols, nasal vowels, various consonants, and examples of these, drawn primarily from French and English.

In his &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; article &quot;Languages&quot;, Young compared the grammar and vocabulary of 400 languages. In a separate work in 1813, he introduced the term Indo-European languages, 165 years after the Dutch linguist and scholar Marcus Zuerius van Boxhorn proposed the grouping to which this term refers in 1647.

===Egyptian hieroglyphs===

Young made significant contributions to the decipherment of ancient Egyptian writing systems. He started his Egyptology work rather late, in 1813, when the work was already in progress among other researchers.

He began by using an Egyptian demotic alphabet of 29 letters built up by Johan David Åkerblad in 1802 (14 turned out to be incorrect). Åkerblad was correct in stressing the importance of the demotic text in trying to read the inscriptions, but he wrongly believed that demotic was entirely alphabetic.

By 1814 Young had completely translated the &quot;enchorial&quot; text of the Rosetta Stone (using a list with 86 demotic words), and then studied the hieroglyphic alphabet but initially failed to recognise that the demotic and hieroglyphic texts were paraphrases and not simple translations.

There was considerable rivalry between Young and Jean-François Champollion while both were working on hieroglyphic decipherment. At first they briefly cooperated in their work, but later, from around 1815, a chill arose between them. For many years they kept details of their work away from each other.

Some of Young&#x27;s conclusions appeared in the famous article &quot;Egypt&quot; he wrote for the 1818 edition of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;.

When Champollion finally published a translation of the hieroglyphs and the key to the grammatical system in 1822, Young (and many others) praised his work. Nevertheless, a year later Young published an &quot;Account of the Recent Discoveries in Hieroglyphic Literature and Egyptian Antiquities&quot;, with the aim of having his own work recognised as the basis for Champollion&#x27;s system.

Young had correctly found the sound value of six hieroglyphic signs, but had not deduced the grammar of the language. Young himself acknowledged that he was somewhat at a disadvantage because Champollion&#x27;s knowledge of the relevant languages, such as Coptic, was much greater.

Several scholars have suggested that Young&#x27;s true contribution to Egyptology was his decipherment of the demotic script. He made the first major advances in this area; he also correctly identified demotic as being composed by both ideographic and phonetic signs.

Subsequently, Young felt that Champollion was unwilling to share the credit for the decipherment. In the ensuing controversy, strongly motivated by the political tensions of that time, the British tended to champion Young, while the French mostly championed Champollion. Champollion did acknowledge some of Young&#x27;s contribution, but rather sparingly. However, after 1826, when Champollion was a curator in the Louvre, he did offer Young access to demotic manuscripts.

In England, while Sir George Lewis still doubted Champollion&#x27;s achievement as late as 1862, others were more accepting. For example, Reginald Poole, and Sir Peter Le Page Renouf both defended Champollion.

===Music===
Young developed Young temperament, a method of tuning musical instruments.

==Legacy==
Later scholars and scientists have praised Young&#x27;s work although they may know him only through achievements he made in their fields. His contemporary Sir John Herschel called him a &quot;truly original genius&quot;. Albert Einstein praised him in the 1931 foreword to an edition of Isaac Newton&#x27;s &quot;Opticks&quot;. Other admirers include physicist Lord Rayleigh and Nobel Physics laureate Philip Anderson.

Thomas Young&#x27;s name has been adopted as the name of the London-based Thomas Young Centre, an alliance of academic research groups engaged in the theory and simulation of materials.

Young Sound in eastern Greenland was named in his honour by William Scoresby (1789–1857).

<doc id="51626" wikidata="Q14655" url="?curid=51626" title="Pelagius of Asturias">
<text>Pelagius (; – 737) was a nobleman who founded the Kingdom of Asturias in 718. Pelagius is credited with initiating the &quot;Reconquista&quot;, the Christian reconquest of the Iberian Peninsula from the Moors, and establishing the Asturian monarchy, making him the forefather of all the future Iberian monarchies, including the Kings of Castile, the Kings of León, and the Kings of Portugal.

==Early life==
Pelagius was born around 685, although the exact details of his early life remain largely unknown. Traditionally, Pelagius was depicted as of Visigothic origin. Recent scholarship increasingly supports that Pelagius was a nobleman of Hispano-Roman descent, linked to the local Asturian elite. Historical texts emphasize Pelayo&#x27;s connection to the local Asturian society. He is believed to be the son of Favila. The &quot;Chronica Albeldense&quot;, elaborated three centuries after his death, says that Favila was a &quot;dux&quot; of Gallaecia, who was killed by Wittiza. The &quot;Chronicle of Alfonso III&quot; identifies Pelagius as a grandson of Chindasuinth and says that his father was blinded in Córdoba, at the instigation of Wittiza. Wittiza is also said to have exiled Pelagius from Toledo upon assuming the crown in 702. In the opinion of Roger Collins, this is a late tradition and the account of the &quot;Albeldense&quot;, which locates Pelagius&#x27;s origins in the north of the peninsula, is more credible. Both chronicles agree, however, that he was a Visigoth who was exiled from Toledo by Wittiza.

According to the later tradition, Munuza, the Berber governor of &quot;Iegione&quot; (either Gijón or León), became attracted to Pelagius&#x27;s sister and sent word to Tariq ibn Ziyad, who ordered him to capture Pelagius and send him to Córdoba. If Munuza&#x27;s seat is identified with Gijón, it may be inferred that the Arabs had established their rule in the Asturias and that Pelagius was not the leader of a local resistance to Arab conquest. Pelagius may have come to terms with the Arab elite whereby he was permitted to govern locally in the manner of the previous Visigoths, as is known to have occurred between Arab rulers and Visigothic noblemen elsewhere, as in the case of Theudimer, although most historians consider this unlikely.

==Reign==
At some point Pelagius is said to have rebelled, but for what reasons is unknown; such rebellions by local authorities against their superiors formed a common theme in Visigothic Spain. A Muslim army was sent against him under the command of Alkama and the Christian bishop of Seville, Oppa. That Alkama was the general and that there was a bishop of Seville named Oppa among his ranks is generally accepted. A battle was fought near Covadonga (&quot;in monte Auseva&quot; or &quot;in monte Libana&quot;) in which Alkama was killed and Oppa captured. Moorish chronicles of the event describe Pelagius and his small force as &quot;thirty wild donkeys&quot;, as reported by al-Maqqari in the 17th century. The battle is usually dated to 718 or 719, between the governorships of al-Hurr and as-Sham, though some have dated it as late as 722 and the &quot;Chronica Albeldensia&quot; dates it in the 740s.

After his election as &quot;princeps&quot; (prince, principal leader) of the Asturians by the local magnates in the Visigothic manner, Pelagius made his capital at Cangas de Onís. The &quot;&quot; says about this election:
And he [Pelagius], going to his mountainous lands, gathered all those who were going to council and ascended a big mountain named Asseuua. He spread his orders between all the Astures, who gathered in council and elected Pelagius as their &quot;princeps&quot;.
His kingdom, firstly centred on the eastern Asturias, soon grew. He married his daughter Ermesinda to the future king Alfonso I, son of Pelagius&#x27;s eastern neighbour, Duke Peter of Cantabria. 

Pelagius reigned for eighteen or nineteen years until his death in 737, when he was succeeded by his son Fafila.

He was buried in the church of Santa Eulalia de Abamia, located in the surroundings of the village of Corao, near Cangas de Onís. His remains were transferred by King Alfonso X of Castile to the Holy Cave of Covadonga, as were those of his wife Gaudiosa and his sister. He left, in addition to his son and successor Fafila, a daughter, Ermesinda, who was to become progenitress, along with King Alfonso I of Asturias (&quot;Alfonso the Catholic&quot;), of the later royalty of Asturias.

==Historiography==

The chief sources for Pelagius&#x27;s life and career are two Latin chronicles written in the late ninth century in the kingdom he founded. The first is the &quot;Chronica Albeldensia&quot;, written at Albelda towards 881, and preserved in the &quot;Codex Vigilanus,&quot; with a continuation to 976. The latter is the &quot;Chronicle of Alfonso III&quot;, which was revised in the early tenth century and preserved in two textual traditions that diverge in several key passages: the &#x27;, preserved in the &quot;Códice de Roda&quot;, and the &#x27;, supposedly written by Sebastian, Bishop of Salamanca (910–913). The only likely earlier written sources from which these chroniclers could derive information are regnal lists.

<doc id="51628" wikidata="Q37937" url="?curid=51628" title="Sweet potato">
<text>The sweet potato or sweetpotato (&quot;Ipomoea batatas&quot;) is a dicotyledonous plant that belongs to the bindweed or morning glory family, Convolvulaceae. Its large, starchy, sweet-tasting tuberous roots are used as a root vegetable. The young shoots and leaves are sometimes eaten as greens. Cultivars of the sweet potato have been bred to bear tubers with flesh and skin of various colors. Sweet potato is only distantly related to the common potato (&quot;Solanum tuberosum&quot;), both being in the order Solanales. Although darker sweet potatoes are often referred to as &quot;yams&quot; in parts of North America, the species is even more distant from the true yams, which are monocots in the order Dioscoreales.

The sweet potato is native to the tropical regions of South America in what is present-day Ecuador. Of the approximately 50 genera and more than 1,000 species of Convolvulaceae, &quot;I. batatas&quot; is the only crop plant of major importance—some others are used locally (e.g., &quot;I. aquatica&quot; &quot;kangkong&quot; as a green vegetable), but many are poisonous. The genus &quot;Ipomoea&quot; that contains the sweet potato also includes several garden flowers called morning glories, but that term is not usually extended to &quot;I. batatas&quot;. Some cultivars of &quot;I. batatas&quot; are grown as ornamental plants under the name &quot;tuberous morning glory,&quot; and used in a horticultural context. Sweet potatoes can also be called yams in North America. When soft varieties were first grown commercially there, there was a need to differentiate between the two. Enslaved Africans had already been calling the &#x27;soft&#x27; sweet potatoes &#x27;yams&#x27; because they resembled the unrelated yams in Africa. Thus, &#x27;soft&#x27; sweet potatoes were referred to as &#x27;yams&#x27; to distinguish them from the &#x27;firm&#x27; varieties.

==Description==
The plant is a herbaceous perennial vine, bearing alternate triangle-shaped or palmately lobed leaves and medium-sized sympetalous flowers. The stems are usually crawling on the ground and form adventitious roots at the nodes. The leaves are screwed along the stems. The leaf stalk is long. The leaf blades are very variable, long, the shape is heart-, kidney- to egg-shaped, rounded or triangular and spear-shaped, the edge can be entire, toothed or often three to seven times lobed, cut or divided. Most of the leaf surfaces are bare, rarely hairy, and the tip is rounded to pointed. The leaves are mostly green in color, but the accumulation of anthocyanins, especially along the leaf veins, can make them purple. Depending on the variety, the total length of a stem can be between . Some cultivars also form shoots up to in length. However, these do not form underground storage organs.

The hermaphrodite, five-fold and short-stalked flowers are single or few in stalked, zymous inflorescences that arise from the leaf axils and stand upright. It produces flowers when the day is short. The small sepals are elongated and tapering to a point and spiky and (rarely only 7) long, usually finely haired or ciliate. The inner three are a little longer. The long, overgrown and funnel-shaped, folded crown, with a shorter hem, can be lavender to purple-lavender in color, the throat is usually darker in color, but white crowns can also appear. The enclosed stamens are of unequal length with glandular filaments. The two-chamber ovary is upper constant with a relatively short stylus. Seeds are only produced from cross-pollination.

The flowers open before sunrise and stay open for a few hours. They close again in the morning and begin to wither. The edible tuberous root is long and tapered, with a smooth skin whose color ranges between yellow, orange, red, brown, purple, and beige. Its flesh ranges from beige through white, red, pink, violet, yellow, orange, and purple. Sweet potato cultivars with white or pale yellow flesh are less sweet and moist than those with red, pink or orange flesh.

==Taxonomy==

The sweet potato originates in South America in what is present-day Ecuador. The domestication of sweet potato occurred in either Central or South America. In Central America, domesticated sweet potatoes were present at least 5,000 years ago, with the origin of &quot;I. batatas&quot; possibly between the Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico and the mouth of the Orinoco River in Venezuela. The cultigen was most likely spread by local people to the Caribbean and South America by 2500 BCE.

&quot;I. trifida&quot;, a diploid, is the closest wild relative of the sweet potato, which originated with an initial cross between a tetraploid and another diploid parent, followed by a second complete genome duplication event. The oldest radiocarbon dating remains of the sweet potato known today were discovered in caves from the Chilca Canyon, in the south-central zone of Peru, and yield an age of 8080 ± 170 BC.

=== Transgenicity ===
The genome of cultivated sweet potatoes contains sequences of DNA from &quot;Agrobacterium&quot; (&quot;sensu lato&quot;; specifically, one related to &quot;Rhizobium rhizogenes&quot;), with genes actively expressed by the plants. The T-DNA transgenes were not observed in closely related wild relatives of the sweet potato. Studies indicated that the sweet potato genome evolved over millennia, with eventual domestication of the crop taking advantage of natural genetic modifications. These observations make sweet potatoes the first known example of a naturally transgenic food crop.

==Cultivation==
===Dispersal history===

Before the arrival of Europeans to the Americas, sweet potato was grown in Polynesia, generally spread by vine cuttings rather than by seeds. Sweet potato has been radiocarbon-dated in the Cook Islands to 1210–1400 CE. A common hypothesis is that a vine cutting was brought to central Polynesia by Polynesians who had traveled to South America and back, and spread from there across Polynesia to Easter Island, Hawaii and New Zealand. Genetic similarities have been found between Polynesian peoples and indigenous Americans including the Zenú, a people inhabiting the Pacific coast of present-day Colombia, indicating that Polynesians could have visited South America and taken sweet potatoes prior to European contact. Dutch linguists and specialists in Amerindian languages Willem Adelaar and Pieter Muysken have suggested that the word for sweet potato is shared by Polynesian languages and languages of South America: Proto-Polynesian * (compare Rapa Nui , Hawaiian , Māori ) may be connected with Quechua and Aymara ~ . Adelaar and Muysken assert that the similarity in the word for sweet potato is proof of either incidental contact or sporadic contact between the Central Andes and Polynesia.

Some researchers, citing divergence time estimates, suggest that sweet potatoes might have been present in Polynesia thousands of years before humans arrived there. However, the present scholarly consensus favours the pre-Columbian contact model.

The sweet potato arrived in Europe with the Columbian exchange. It is recorded, for example, in &quot;Elinor Fettiplace&#x27;s Receipt Book&quot;, compiled in England in 1604.

Sweet potatoes were first introduced to the Philippines during the Spanish colonial period (1521–1898) via the Manila galleons, along with other New World crops. It was introduced to the Fujian of China in about 1594 from Luzon, in response to a major crop failure. The growing of sweet potatoes was encouraged by the Governor Chin Hsüeh-tseng (Jin Xuezeng).

Sweet potatoes were also introduced to the Ryukyu Kingdom, present-day Okinawa, Japan, in the early 1600s by the Portuguese. Sweet potatoes became a staple in Japan because they were important in preventing famine when rice harvests were poor. Aoki Konyō helped popularize the cultivation of the sweet potato in Japan, and the Tokugawa bakufu sponsored, published, and disseminated a vernacular Japanese translation of his research monograph on sweet potatoes to encourage their growth more broadly. Sweet potatoes were planted in Shōgun Tokugawa Yoshimune&#x27;s private garden. It was first introduced to Korea in 1764. Kang P&#x27;il-ri and Yi Kwang-ryŏ embarked on a project to grow sweet potatoes in Seoul in 1766, using the knowledge of Japanese cultivators they learned in Tongnae starting in 1764. The project succeeded for a year but ultimately failed in winter 1767 after Kang&#x27;s unexpected death.

=== Names ===

Although the soft, orange sweet potato is often called a &quot;&quot; in parts of North America, the sweet potato is very distinct from the botanical yam (&quot;Dioscorea&quot;), which has a cosmopolitan distribution, and belongs to the monocot family Dioscoreaceae. A different crop plant, the &quot;oca&quot; (&quot;Oxalis tuberosa&quot;, a species of wood sorrel), is called a &quot;yam&quot; in many parts of the world.

Although the sweet potato is not closely related botanically to the common potato, they have a shared etymology. The first Europeans to taste sweet potatoes were members of Christopher Columbus&#x27;s expedition in 1492. Later explorers found many cultivars under an assortment of local names, but the name which stayed was the indigenous Taíno name of &quot;&quot;. The Spanish combined this with the Quechua word for potato, , to create the word for the common potato.

Though the sweet potato is also called () in Hebrew, this is not a direct loan of the Taíno word. Rather, the Spanish was loaned into Arabic as (), owing to the lack of a sound in Arabic, while the sweet potato was called (); literally (&#x27;sweet potato&#x27;). The Arabic was loaned into Hebrew as designating the sweet potato only, as Hebrew had its own word for the common potato, (, literally &#x27;earth apple&#x27;; compare French &quot;&quot;).

Some organizations and researchers advocate for the styling of the name as one word—&quot;sweetpotato&quot;—instead of two, to emphasize the plant&#x27;s genetic uniqueness from both common potatoes and yams and to avoid confusion of it being classified as a type of common potato. In its current usage in American English, the styling of the name as two words is still preferred.

In Argentina, Colombia, Venezuela, Puerto Rico, and the Dominican Republic, the sweet potato is called . In Brazil, the sweet potato is called . In Mexico, Bolivia, Peru, Chile, Central America, and the Philippines, the sweet potato is known as (alternatively spelled in the Philippines), derived from the Nahuatl word .
In Peru and Bolivia, the general word in Quechua for the sweet potato is , but there are variants used such as , (Ayacucho Quechua), and (Bolivian Quechua), strikingly similar to the Polynesian name and its regional Oceanic cognates (, , , etc.), which has led some scholars to suspect an instance of pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact. This theory is also supported by genetic evidence.

In Australia, about 90% of production is devoted to the orange cultivar &#x27;Beauregard&#x27;,&lt;ref name=&quot;researchgate/281529159&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; which was originally developed by the Louisiana Agricultural Experiment Station in 1981.

In New Zealand, the Māori varieties bore elongated tubers with white skin and a whitish flesh, which points to pre-European cross-Pacific travel. Known as &quot;kumara&quot; (from the Māori language ), the most common cultivar now is the red &#x27;Owairaka&#x27;, but orange (&#x27;Beauregard&#x27;), gold, purple and other cultivars are also grown.

=== Habitat ===
The plant does not tolerate frost. It grows best at an average temperature of , with abundant sunshine and warm nights. Annual rainfalls of are considered most suitable, with a minimum of in the growing season. The crop is sensitive to drought at the tuber initiation stage 50–60 days after planting, and it is not tolerant to waterlogging, which may cause tuber rots and reduce the growth of storage roots if aeration is poor.
Depending on the cultivar and conditions, tuberous roots mature in two to nine months. With care, early-maturing cultivars can be grown as an annual summer crop in warm temperate areas, such as the Eastern United States and China. Sweet potatoes rarely flower when the daylight is longer than 11 hours, as is normal outside of the tropics. They are mostly propagated by stem or root cuttings or by adventitious shoots called &quot;slips&quot; that grow out from the tuberous roots during storage. True seeds are used for breeding only.

They grow well in many farming conditions and have few natural enemies; pesticides are rarely needed. Sweet potatoes are grown on a variety of soils, but well-drained, light- and medium-textured soils with a pH range of 4.5–7.0 are more favorable for the plant. They can be grown in poor soils with little fertilizer. However, sweet potatoes are very sensitive to aluminium toxicity and will die about six weeks after planting if lime is not applied at planting in this type of soil. As they are sown by vine cuttings rather than seeds, sweet potatoes are relatively easy to plant. As the rapidly growing vines shade out weeds, little weeding is needed. A commonly used herbicide to rid the soil of any unwelcome plants that may interfere with growth is DCPA, also known as Dacthal. In the tropics, the crop can be maintained in the ground and harvested as needed for market or home consumption. In temperate regions, sweet potatoes are most often grown on larger farms and are harvested before first frosts.

Sweet potatoes are cultivated throughout tropical and warm temperate regions wherever there is sufficient water to support their growth. Sweet potatoes became common as a food crop in the islands of the Pacific Ocean, South India, Uganda and other African countries.

A cultivar of the sweet potato called the &quot;boniato&quot; is grown in the Caribbean; its flesh is cream-colored, unlike the more common orange hue seen in other cultivars. &quot;Boniatos&quot; are not as sweet and moist as other sweet potatoes, but their consistency and delicate flavor are different from the common orange-colored sweet potato.
Sweet potatoes have been a part of the diet in the U.S. for most of its history, especially in the Southeast. The average per capita consumption of sweet potatoes in the United States is only about per year, down from in 1920. &quot;Orange sweet potatoes (the most common type encountered in the US) received higher appearance liking scores compared with yellow or purple cultivars.&quot; Purple and yellow sweet potatoes were not as well liked by consumers compared to orange sweet potatoes &quot;possibly because of the familiarity of orange color that is associated with sweet potatoes.&quot;

In the Southeastern U.S., sweet potatoes are traditionally cured to improve storage, flavor, and nutrition, and to allow wounds on the periderm of the harvested root to heal. Proper curing requires drying the freshly dug roots on the ground for two to three hours, then storage at with 90 to 95% relative humidity from five to fourteen days. Cured sweet potatoes can keep for thirteen months when stored at with &gt;90% relative humidity. Colder temperatures injure the roots.

=== Production ===
In 2020, global production of sweet potatoes was 89 million tonnes, led by China with 55% of the world total (table). Secondary producers were Malawi, Tanzania, and Nigeria. It is the fifth most important food crop in developing countries. Studies are being done to develop a salt tolerant variety to combat the effects of climate change.

===Diseases===

Sweet potato suffers from Sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus (a Crinivirus). In synergy with other any of a large number of other viruses, Untiveros et al., 2007 finds SPCSV produces an even more severe symptomology. &quot;I. batatas&quot; suffers from several &quot;Phytophthora&quot;s including &quot;P. carotovorum&quot;, &quot;P. odoriferum&quot;, and &quot;P. wasabiae&quot;.

==Uses==

=== Nutrition ===

Cooked sweet potato (baked in skin) is 76% water, 21% carbohydrates, 2% protein, and contains negligible fat (table). In a 100 gram reference amount, baked sweet potato provides 90 calories, and rich contents (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of vitamin A (120% DV), vitamin C (24% DV), manganese (24% DV), and vitamin B6 (20% DV). It is a moderate source (10–19% DV) of some B vitamins and potassium. Between 50% and 90% of the sugar content is sucrose. Maltose content is very low, but baking can increase the maltose content from between 10% and 20%.

Sweet potato cultivars with dark orange flesh have more beta-carotene (converted to a higher vitamin A content once digested) than those with light-colored flesh, and their increased cultivation is being encouraged in Africa where vitamin A deficiency is a serious health problem. Sweet potato leaves are edible and can be prepared like spinach or turnip greens.

===Comparison to other food staples===
The table below presents the relative performance of sweet potato (in column) to other staple foods on a dry weight basis to account for their different water contents. While sweet potato provides less edible energy and protein per unit weight than cereals, it has higher nutrient density than cereals.

According to a study by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, sweet potatoes are the most efficient staple food to grow in terms of farmland, yielding approximately / day.

=== Culinary ===

The starchy tuberous roots of the sweet potato are by far the most important product of the plant. In some tropical areas, the tubers are a staple food crop. The tuber is often cooked before consumption as this increases its nutrition and digestibility, although the American colonists in the Southeast ate raw sweet potatoes as a staple food.

The vines&#x27; tips and young leaves are edible as a green vegetable with a characteristic flavor. Older growths may be used as animal fodder.

====Africa====

&quot;Amukeke&quot; (sun-dried slices of root) and &quot;inginyo&quot; (sun-dried crushed root) are a staple food for people in northeastern Uganda. &quot;Amukeke&quot; is mainly served for breakfast, eaten with peanut sauce. &quot;Inginyo&quot; is mixed with cassava flour and tamarind to make &quot;atapa&quot;. People eat &quot;atapa&quot; with smoked fish cooked in peanut sauce or with dried cowpea leaves cooked in peanut sauce. &quot;Emukaru&quot; (earth-baked root) is eaten as a snack anytime and is mostly served with tea or with peanut sauce. Similar uses are also found in South Sudan.

The young leaves and vine tips of sweet potato leaves are widely consumed as a vegetable in West African countries (Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, for example), as well as in northeastern Uganda, East Africa. According to FAO leaflet No. 13 – 1990, sweet potato leaves and shoots are a good source of vitamins A, C, and B2 (riboflavin), and according to research done by A. Khachatryan, are an excellent source of lutein.

In Kenya, Rhoda Nungo of the home economics department of the Ministry of Agriculture has written a guide to using sweet potatoes in modern recipes. This includes uses both in the mashed form and as flour from the dried tubers to replace part of the wheat flour and sugar in baked products such as cakes, chapatis, mandazis, bread, buns and cookies. A nutritious juice drink is made from the orange-fleshed cultivars, and deep-fried snacks are also included.

In Egypt, sweet potato tubers are known as () and are a common street food in winter, when street vendors with carts fitted with ovens sell them to people passing time by the Nile or the sea. The cultivars used are an orange-fleshed one as well as a white/cream-fleshed one. They are also baked at home as a snack or dessert, drenched with honey.

In Ethiopia, the commonly found cultivars are black-skinned, cream-fleshed and called &quot;bitatis&quot; or &quot;mitatis&quot;. They are cultivated in the eastern and southern lower highlands and harvested during the rainy season (June/July). In recent years, better yielding orange-fleshed cultivars were released for cultivation by Haramaya University as a less sugary sweet potato with higher vitamin A content. Sweet potatoes are widely eaten boiled as a favored snack.

In South Africa, sweet potatoes are often eaten as a side dish such as soetpatats.

====Asia====
In East Asia, roasted sweet potatoes are popular street food. In China, sweet potatoes, typically yellow cultivars, are baked in a large iron drum and sold as street food during winter. In Korea, sweet potatoes, known as , are roasted in a drum can, baked in foil or on an open fire, typically during winter. In Japan, a dish similar to the Korean preparation is called &quot;yaki-imo&quot; (roasted sweet potato), which typically uses either the yellow-fleshed &quot;Japanese sweet potato&quot; or the purple-fleshed &quot;Okinawan sweet potato&quot;, which is known as .

Sweet potato soup, served during winter, consists of sweet potato boiled in water with rock sugar and ginger. In Fujian cuisine and Taiwanese cuisine, sweet potato is often cooked with rice to make congee. Steamed and dried sweet potato is a specialty of Liancheng County. Sweet potato greens are a common side dish in Taiwanese cuisine, often boiled or sautéed and served with a garlic and soy sauce mixture, or simply salted before serving. They, as well as dishes featuring the sweet potato root, are commonly found at bento () restaurants. In northeastern Chinese cuisine, sweet potatoes are often cut into chunks and fried, before being drenched into a pan of boiling syrup.

In some regions of India, sweet potato is roasted slowly over kitchen coals at night and eaten with some dressing, while the easier way in the south is simply boiling or pressure cooking before peeling, cubing and seasoning for a vegetable dish as part of the meal. In the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, it is known as . It is boiled and consumed as evening snack. In some parts of India, fresh sweet potato is chipped, dried and then ground into flour; this is then mixed with wheat flour and baked into &quot;chapatti&quot; (bread). Between 15 and 20 percent of the sweet potato harvest is converted by some Indian communities into pickles and snack chips. A part of the tuber harvest is used in India as cattle fodder.

In Pakistan, sweet potato is known as and is cooked as a vegetable dish and also with meat dishes (chicken, mutton or beef). The ash-roasted sweet potatoes are sold as a snack and street food in Pakistani bazaars especially during the winter months.

In Sri Lanka, it is called , and tubers are used mainly for breakfast (boiled sweet potato is commonly served with sambal or grated coconut) or as a supplementary curry dish for rice.

The tubers of this plant, known as in Dhivehi, have been used in the traditional diet of the Maldives. The leaves were finely chopped and used in dishes such as &quot;mas huni&quot;.
In Japan, both sweet potatoes (called &quot;satsuma-imo&quot;) and true purple yams (called or ) are grown. Boiling, roasting and steaming are the most common cooking methods. Also, the use in vegetable tempura is common. (:ja:大学芋) is a baked and caramel-syruped sweet potato dessert. As it is sweet and starchy, it is used in &quot;imo-kinton&quot; and some other traditional sweets, such as &quot;ofukuimo&quot;. What is commonly called &quot;sweet potato&quot; (:ja:スイートポテト) in Japan is a cake made by baking mashed sweet potatoes.
&quot;Shōchū&quot;, a Japanese spirit normally made from the fermentation of rice, can also be made from sweet potato, in which case it is called . &quot;Imo-gohan&quot;, sweet potato cooked with rice, is popular in Guangdong, Taiwan and Japan. It is also served in &quot;nimono&quot; or &quot;nitsuke&quot;, boiled and typically flavored with soy sauce, &quot;mirin&quot; and &quot;dashi&quot;.
In Korean cuisine, sweet potato starch is used to produce (cellophane noodles). Sweet potatoes are also boiled, steamed, or roasted, and young stems are eaten as &quot;namul&quot;. Pizza restaurants such as Pizza Hut and Domino&#x27;s in Korea are using sweet potatoes as a popular topping. Sweet potatoes are also used in the distillation of a variety of Soju. A popular Korean side dish or snack, , also known as Korean candied sweet potato, is made by deep-frying sweet potatoes that were cut into big chunks and coating them with caramelized sugar.

In Malaysia and Singapore, sweet potato is often cut into small cubes and cooked with taro and coconut milk () to make a sweet dessert called &quot;bubur cha cha&quot;. A favorite way of cooking sweet potato is deep-frying slices of sweet potato in batter, served as a tea-time snack. In homes, sweet potatoes are usually boiled. The leaves of sweet potatoes are usually stir-fried with only garlic or with and dried shrimp by Malaysians.

In the Philippines, sweet potatoes (locally known as or ) are an important food crop in rural areas. They are often a staple among impoverished families in provinces, as they are easier to cultivate and cost less than rice. The tubers are boiled or baked in coals and may be dipped in sugar or syrup. Young leaves and shoots (locally known as or &#x27; tops) are eaten fresh in salads with shrimp paste () or fish sauce. They can be cooked in vinegar and soy sauce and served with fried fish (a dish known as ), or with recipes such as &quot;sinigang&quot;. The stew obtained from boiling &#x27; tops is purple-colored, and is often mixed with lemon as juice. Sweet potatoes are also sold as street food in suburban and rural areas. Fried sweet potatoes coated with caramelized sugar and served in skewers (&quot;camote cue&quot;) or as French fries are popular afternoon snacks. Sweet potatoes are also used in a variant of &quot;halo-halo&quot; called , where they are cooked in coconut milk and sugar and mixed with a variety of rootcrops, sago, jackfruit, and (glutinous rice balls). Bread made from sweet potato flour is also gaining popularity. Sweet potato is relatively easy to propagate, and in rural areas can be seen abundantly at canals and dikes. The uncultivated plant is usually fed to pigs.

In Indonesia, sweet potatoes are locally known as (lit: &quot;spreading tuber&quot;) or simply and are frequently fried with batter and served as snacks with spicy condiments, along with other kinds of fritters such as fried bananas, tempeh, tahu, breadfruit, or cassava. In the mountainous regions of West Papua, sweet potatoes are the staple food among the natives there. Using the method of cooking, rocks that have been burned in a nearby bonfire are thrown into a pit lined with leaves. Layers of sweet potatoes, an assortment of vegetables, and pork are piled on top of the rocks. The top of the pile then is insulated with more leaves, creating a pressure of heat and steam inside which cooks all food within the pile after several hours.

In Vietnamese cuisine sweet potatoes are known as and they are commonly cooked with a sweetener such as corn syrup, honey, sugar, or molasses.

Young sweet potato leaves are also used as baby food, particularly in Southeast Asia and East Asia. Mashed sweet potato tubers are used similarly throughout the world.

====United States====
Candied sweet potatoes are a side dish consisting mainly of sweet potatoes prepared with brown sugar, marshmallows, maple syrup, molasses, orange juice, &quot;marron glacé&quot;, or other sweet ingredients. It is often served in the US on Thanksgiving. Sweet potato casserole is a side dish of mashed sweet potatoes in a casserole dish, topped with a brown sugar and pecan topping.

The sweet potato became a favorite food item of the French and Spanish settlers, thus beginning a long history of cultivation in Louisiana. Sweet potatoes are recognized as the state vegetable of Alabama, Louisiana, and North Carolina. Sweet potato pie is also a traditional favorite dish in Southern U.S. cuisine. Another variation on the typical sweet potato pie is the Okinawan sweet potato haupia pie, which is made with purple sweet potatoes.

The fried sweet potatoes tradition dates to the early nineteenth century in the United States. Sweet potato fries or chips are a common preparation and are made by julienning and deep-frying sweet potatoes in the fashion of French fried potatoes. Roasting sliced or chopped sweet potatoes lightly coated in animal or vegetable oil at high heat became common in the United States at the start of the 21st century, a dish called &quot;sweet potato fries&quot;. Sweet potato mash is served as a side dish, often at Thanksgiving dinner or with barbecue.

John Buttencourt Avila is called the &quot;father of the sweet potato industry&quot; in North America.

====Oceania====
Māori grew several varieties of small, yellow-skinned, finger-sized kūmara (with names including , , , , and ) that they had brought with them from east Polynesia. Modern trials have shown that these smaller varieties were capable of producing well, but when American whalers, sealers and trading vessels introduced larger cultivars in the early 19th century, they quickly predominated.

Prior to 2021, archaeologists believed that the sweet potato failed to flourish in New Zealand south of Christchurch due to the colder climate, forcing Māori in those latitudes to become (along with the Moriori of the Chatham Islands) the only Polynesian people who subsisted solely on hunting and gathering. However, a 2021 analysis of material excavated from a site near Dunedin, some further south, revealed that sweet potatoes were grown and stored there during the 15th century, before the industry was disrupted by factors speculated to be due to the Little Ice Age.

Māori traditionally cooked kūmara in a hāngī (earth oven). This is still a common practice when there are large gatherings on marae.

In 1947, black rot (&quot;Ceratocystis fimbriata&quot;) appeared in kūmara around Auckland and increased in severity through the 1950s. A disease-free strain was developed by Joe and Fay Gock. They gave the strain to the nation, earning them the Bledisloe Cup in 2013.

There are three main cultivars of kūmara sold in New Zealand: &#x27;Owairaka Red&#x27; (&quot;red&quot;), &#x27;Toka Toka Gold&#x27; (&quot;gold&quot;), and &#x27;Beauregard&#x27; (&quot;orange&quot;). The country grows around 24,000 metric tons of kūmara annually, with nearly all of it (97%) grown in the Northland Region. Kūmara are widely available throughout New Zealand year-round, where they are a popular alternative to potatoes.

Kūmara are often included in roast meals, and served with sour cream and sweet chili sauce. They are served alongside such vegetables as potatoes and pumpkin and as such, are generally prepared in a savory manner. They are ubiquitous in supermarkets, roast meal takeaway shops and hāngī.
Among the Urapmin people of Papua New Guinea, taro (known in Urap as ) and the sweet potato (Urap: ) are the main sources of sustenance, and in fact the word for &#x27;food&#x27; in Urap is a compound of these two words.

====Europe====
In the Veneto (northeast Italy), sweet potato is known as in the Venetian language ( in Italian, meaning &quot;American potato&quot;), and it is cultivated above all in the southern area of the region;.

In Spain, sweet potato is called . On the evening of All Souls&#x27; Day, in Catalonia (northeastern Spain) it is traditional to serve roasted sweet potato and chestnuts, panellets and sweet wine. The occasion is called . As of 2023 Spain is the largest sweet potato producer in Europe.

====South America====
In Peru, sweet potatoes are called and are frequently served alongside ceviche. Sweet potato chips are also a commonly sold snack, be it on the street or in packaged foods.

Dulce de batata is a traditional Argentine, Paraguayan and Uruguayan dessert, which is made of sweet potatoes. It is a sweet jelly, which resembles a marmalade because of its color and sweetness but it has a harder texture, and has to be sliced in thin portions with a knife as if it was a pie.

====Globally====
Globally, sweet potatoes are now a staple ingredient of modern sushi cuisine, specifically used in maki rolls. The advent of sweet potato as a sushi ingredient is credited to chef Bun Lai of Miya&#x27;s Sushi, who first introduced sweet potato rolls in the 1990s as a plant-based alternative to traditional fish-based sushi rolls.

===Molecular gastronomy===
Freezing a sweet potato until solid, baking at a low temperature, then increasing to a high temperature brings out the sweetness by caramelizing converted sugars.

===Ceramics===
Ceramics modeled after sweet potatoes or are often found in the Moche culture.

===Dyes===
In South America, the juice of red sweet potatoes is combined with lime juice to make a dye for cloth. By varying the proportions of the juices, every shade from pink to black can be obtained. Purple sweet potato color is also used as a natural food coloring.

===Aquariums===
Cuttings of sweet potato vine, either edible or ornamental cultivars, will rapidly form roots in water and will grow in it, indefinitely, in good lighting with a steady supply of nutrients. For this reason, sweet potato vine is ideal for use in home aquariums, trailing out of the water with its roots submerged, as its rapid growth is fueled by toxic ammonia and nitrates, a waste product of aquatic life, which it removes from the water. This improves the living conditions for fish, which also find refuge in the extensive root systems.

===Ornamentals===

Ornamental sweet potatoes are popular landscape, container, and bedding plants. Grown as an annual in zones up to USDA hardiness Zone 9, they grow rapidly and spread quickly. Cultivars are available in many colors, such as green, yellow, and purple. Some ornamental varieties, like &#x27;Blackie&#x27;, flower more than others. These ornamental cultivars are not poisonous, and although the leaves are edible, the tubers do not have a good taste.

<doc id="51630" wikidata="Q186130" url="?curid=51630" title="Pulse-amplitude modulation">
<text>Pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM) is a form of signal modulation where the message information is encoded in the amplitude of a series of signal pulses. It is an analog pulse modulation scheme in which the amplitudes of a train of carrier pulses are varied according to the sample value of the message signal. Demodulation is performed by detecting the amplitude level of the carrier at every single period.

==Types==
There are two types of pulse amplitude modulation:
* In &quot;single polarity PAM&quot;, a suitable fixed DC bias is added to the signal to ensure that all the pulses are positive. 
* In &quot;double polarity PAM&quot;, the pulses are both positive and negative.

Pulse-amplitude modulation is widely used in modulating signal transmission of digital data, with non-baseband applications having been largely replaced by pulse-code modulation, and, more recently, by pulse-position modulation.

The number of possible pulse amplitudes in analog PAM is theoretically infinite. Digital PAM reduces the number of pulse amplitudes to some power of two. For example, in 4-level PAM there are formula_1 possible discrete pulse amplitudes; in 8-level PAM there are formula_2 possible discrete pulse amplitudes; and in 16-level PAM there are formula_3 possible discrete pulse amplitudes.

==Uses==

===Ethernet===
Some versions of the Ethernet communication standard are an example of PAM usage. In particular, 100BASE-T4 and BroadR-Reach Ethernet standard use three-level PAM modulation (PAM-3), while 1000BASE-T Gigabit Ethernet uses five-level PAM-5 modulation and 10GBASE-T 10 Gigabit Ethernet uses a Tomlinson-Harashima precoded (THP) version of pulse-amplitude modulation with 16 discrete levels (PAM-16), encoded in a two-dimensional checkerboard pattern known as DSQ128. 25 Gigabit Ethernet and some copper variants of 100 Gigabit Ethernet and 200 Gigabit Ethernet use PAM-4 modulation.

===USB===
USB4 Version 2.0 uses PAM-3 signaling for USB4 80 Gbps (USB4 Gen 4×2) and USB4 120 Gbps (USB4 Gen 4 Asymmetric) transmitting 3 bits per 2 clock cycles. Thunderbolt 5 uses the same PHY.

===GDDR6X===
GDDR6X, developed by Micron and Nvidia and first used in the Nvidia RTX 3080 and 3090 graphics cards, uses PAM-4 signaling to transmit 2 bits per clock cycle without having to resort to higher frequencies or two channels or lanes with associated transmitters and receivers, which may increase power or space consumption and cost. Higher frequencies require higher bandwidth, which is a significant problem beyond 28 GHz when trying to transmit through copper. PAM-4 costs more to implement than earlier NRZ (non return to zero, PAM-2) coding partly because it requires more space in integrated circuits, and is more susceptible to SNR (signal to noise ratio) problems.

===GDDR7===
GDDR7 will utilize PAM-3 signaling to achieve speeds of 36 Gbps/pin. The higher data transmission rate per cycle compared to NRZ/PAM-2-signaling used by GDDR6 and prior generations improves power efficiency and signal integrity.

===PCI Express===
PCI Express 6.0 has introduced PAM-4 usage.

===Photo biology===
The concept is also used for the study of photosynthesis using a specialized instrument that involves a spectrofluorometric measurement of the kinetics of fluorescence rise and decay in the light-harvesting antenna of thylakoid membranes, thus querying various aspects of the state of the photosystems under different environmental conditions. Unlike the traditional dark-adapted chlorophyll fluorescence measurements, pulse amplitude fluorescence devices allow measuring under ambient light conditions, which made measurements significantly more versatile.

===Electronic drivers for LED lighting===
Pulse-amplitude modulation has also been developed for the control of light-emitting diodes (LEDs), especially for lighting applications. LED drivers based on the PAM technique offer improved energy efficiency over systems based upon other common driver modulation techniques such as pulse-width modulation (PWM) as the forward current passing through an LED is relative to the intensity of the light output and the LED efficiency increases as the forward current is reduced.

Pulse-amplitude modulation LED drivers are able to synchronize pulses across multiple LED channels to enable perfect color matching. Due to the inherent nature of PAM in conjunction with the rapid switching speed of LEDs, it is possible to use LED lighting as a means of wireless data transmission at high speed.

===Digital television===
The North American Advanced Television Systems Committee standards for digital television uses a form of PAM to broadcast the data that makes up the television signal. This system, known as 8VSB, is based on an eight-level PAM. It uses additional processing to suppress one sideband and thus make more efficient use of limited bandwidth. Using a single 6 MHz channel allocation, as defined in the previous NTSC analog standard, 8VSB is capable of transmitting 32 Mbit/s. After accounting for error-correcting codes and other overhead, the data rate in the signal is 19.39 Mbit/s.

<text>Puffballs are a type of fungus featuring a ball-shaped fruit body that (when mature) bursts on contact or impact, releasing a cloud of dust-like spores into the surrounding area. Puffballs belong to the division Basidiomycota and encompass several genera, including &quot;Calvatia&quot;, &quot;Calbovista&quot; and &quot;Lycoperdon&quot;. The puffballs were previously treated as a taxonomic group called the Gasteromycetes or Gasteromycetidae, but they are now known to be a polyphyletic assemblage.

The distinguishing feature of all puffballs is that they do not have an open cap with spore-bearing gills. Instead, spores are produced internally, in a spheroidal fruit body called a &quot;gasterothecium&quot; (gasteroid &#x27;stomach-like&#x27; basidiocarp). As the spores mature, they form a mass called a gleba in the centre of the fruitbody that is often of a distinctive color and texture. The basidiocarp remains closed until after the spores have been released from the basidia. Eventually, it develops an aperture, or dries, becomes brittle, and splits, and the spores escape. The spores of puffballs are &quot;statismospores&quot; rather than ballistospores, meaning they are not forcibly extruded from the basidium. Puffballs and similar forms are thought to have evolved convergently (that is, in numerous independent events) from Hymenomycetes by &quot;gasteromycetation&quot;, through secotioid stages. Thus, &#x27;Gasteromycetes&#x27; and &#x27;Gasteromycetidae&#x27; are now considered to be descriptive, morphological terms (more properly &quot;gasteroid&quot; or &quot;gasteromycetes&quot;, to avoid taxonomic implications) but not valid cladistic terms.

True puffballs do not have a visible stalk or stem, while stalked puffballs do have a stalk that supports the gleba. None of the stalked puffballs are edible as they are tough and woody mushrooms. The Hymenogastrales and &quot;Enteridium lycoperdon&quot;, a slime mold, are the &quot;false puffballs&quot;. A gleba which is powdery on maturity is a feature of true puffballs, stalked puffballs and earthstars. False puffballs are hard like rock or brittle. All false puffballs are inedible, as they are tough and bitter to taste. The genus &quot;Scleroderma&quot;, which has a young purple gleba, should also be avoided.

Puffballs were traditionally used in Tibet for making ink by burning them, grinding the ash, then putting them in water and adding glue liquid and &quot;a decoction&quot;, which, when pressed for a long time, made a black dark substance that was used as ink. Rural Americans burned the common puffball with some kind of bee smoker to anesthetize honey bees as a means to safely procure honey; the practice later inspired experimental medicinal application of the puffball smoke as a surgical general anesthetic in 1853.

==Edibility and identification==
While most puffballs are not poisonous, some often look similar to young agarics, and especially the deadly Amanitas, such as the death cap or destroying angel mushrooms. Young puffballs in the edible stage, before maturation of the gleba, have undifferentiated white flesh within, whereas the gills of immature Amanita mushrooms can be seen if they are closely examined. They can be very toxic.

The giant puffball, &quot;Calvatia gigantea&quot; (earlier classified as &quot;Lycoperdon giganteum&quot;), reaches or more in diameter, and is difficult to mistake for any other fungus. It has been estimated that, when mature, a large specimen of this fungus will produce around 7 × 10 spores, which is more than any other known organism.

Not all true puffball mushrooms are without stalks. Some may also be stalked, such as the &quot;Podaxis pistillaris&quot;, which is also called the &quot;false shaggy mane&quot;. There are also a number of false puffballs that look similar to the true ones.

<text>In criminal law,  (; Law Latin for &quot;guilty mind&quot;) is the mental state of a defendant who is accused of committing a crime. In common law jurisdictions, most crimes require proof both of &quot;mens rea&quot; and &quot;actus reus&quot; (&quot;guilty act&quot;) before the defendant can be found guilty.

== Introduction ==
The standard common law test of criminal liability is expressed in the Latin phrase , i.e. &quot;the act is not culpable unless the mind is guilty&quot;. As a general rule, someone who acted without mental fault is not liable in criminal law. Exceptions are known as strict liability crimes. Moreover, when a person intends a harm, but as a result of bad aim or other cause the intent is transferred from an intended victim to an unintended victim, the case is considered to be a matter of transferred intent.

The types of mental states that apply to crimes vary depending on whether a jurisdiction follows criminal law under the common law tradition or, within the United States, according to the Model Penal Code.

In civil law, it is usually not necessary to prove a subjective mental element to establish liability for breach of contract or tort, for example. But if a tort is intentionally committed or a contract is intentionally breached, such intent may increase the scope of liability and the damages payable to the plaintiff.

In some jurisdictions, the terms and have been replaced by alternative terminology.

== Levels of &quot;mens rea&quot; within the United States ==
Under the tradition of common law, judges would often require a &quot;bad state of mind&quot; in addition to an action or omission (&quot;actus reus&quot;) to find a criminal guilty. Over time, culpable mental states (&quot;mens rea&quot;) became varied among different types of crimes. Such crimes and mental states might include, for example, &quot;malice&quot; for murder, &quot;fraudulence&quot; for fraud, &quot;willfulness and corruption&quot; for perjury, and so on. The crime of manslaughter, further, might not even require a &quot;bad mind&quot; but simply a &quot;negligent&quot; one. Regardless of how the requirements are categorized, the Supreme Court has explained &quot;mens rea&quot; requirements for crimes are &quot;universal&quot; and essential to &quot;mature systems of law&quot;, even going so far as to say that this belief undergirds notions of free will and morality.

Within the United States, there is no single encompassing criminal law. Criminal laws are passed and enforced by the states‚ or the federal government, but each of these criminal &quot;codes&quot; vary and may or may not draw from the same theoretical sources.

=== State criminal law ===
The vast majority of criminal prosecutions in the United States are carried out by the several states in accordance with the laws of the state in question. Historically, the states (with the partial exception of civil-law Louisiana) applied common law rules of &quot;mens rea&quot; similar to those extant in England, but over time American understandings of common law &quot;mens rea&quot; terms diverged from those of English law and from each other. Concepts like &quot;general intent&quot; and &quot;specific intent&quot; dominated classifications of mental states in state common law, but by the late 1950s to early 1960s, the common law of &quot;mens rea&quot; was widely acknowledged to be a slippery, vague, and confused mess. This was one of several factors that led to the development of the Model Penal Code. Nevertheless, states continue to use mental states beyond or besides those listed in the Model Penal Code.

Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer described the distinction between the two systems in his dissent in &quot;Delling v. Idaho&quot;:


=== Federal criminal law ===
Since the federal government of the United States does not have a generalized police power like that of the states, the scope of its criminal statutes is necessarily circumscribed. Ordinary prosecutions are the province of the states, and only crimes connected to the constitutional powers may be pursued by the federal government. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court holds that required &quot;mens rea&quot; is an essential element of federal criminal offenses. Consequently, Title 18 of the United States Code does not use the aforementioned culpability scheme but relies instead on more traditional definitions of crimes taken from common law. For example, &quot;malice aforethought&quot; is used as a requirement for committing capital murder, and the Supreme Court has applied mental states such as &quot;willfully.&quot;

=== Model Penal Code ===
Because the landscape of criminal law varied from state to state, the American Law Institute (which issues &quot;restatements&quot; of American legal jurisprudence) declined to issue a restatement of criminal law in favor of a &quot;model&quot; code for states to issue new, standardized criminal law. This Model Penal Code (&quot;MPC&quot;) was completed in 1962, and received praise from legal scholars for its reformulation of criminal law. Although not all states follow the criminal law as constructed within the MPC, over 34 states had adopted part or substantially all of the MPC as law by 1983. The federal government has not adopted the MPC, although it has attempted to do so for many decades.

Since its publication, the formulation of &quot;mens rea&quot; set forth in the Model Penal Code has been highly influential throughout the United States in clarifying the discussion of the different modes of culpability. The following levels of &quot;mens rea&quot; are found in the MPC §2.02(2), and are considered by the United States Supreme Court to be the four states of mind that give rise to criminal liability:

* &quot;Negligently&quot;: a &quot;reasonable person&quot; ought to be aware of a &quot;substantial and unjustifiable risk&quot; that is a &quot;gross deviation&quot; from a normal standard of care.
* &quot;Recklessly&quot;: the actor &quot;consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk&quot; in &quot;gross deviation&quot; from a normal standard of care.
* &quot;Knowingly&quot;: the actor is &quot;practically certain&quot; that his conduct will lead to the result, or is aware to a high probability that his conduct is of a prohibited nature, or is aware to a high probability that the attendant circumstances exist.
* &quot;Purposefully&quot;: the actor &quot;consciously&quot; engages in conduct and &quot;desires&quot; the result. The Supreme Court has not found a large difference between purposeful and knowing conduct, not only in theory but also in application.

The above mental states also work in a hierarchy, with &quot;negligence&quot; as the lowest mental state and &quot;purposefully&quot; as the highest: a finding of purposefully/intentional establishes a state of knowingness, recklessness, and negligence; a finding of knowingness establishes a finding of recklessness and negligence, and a finding of recklessness establishes a state of negligence.(5)

The MPC also recognizes culpability not because of a mental state, but for crimes that are legislatively proscribed due to the imposition of &quot;absolute liability.&quot; Strict liability crimes will require evidence of such legislative intent, and courts seriously examine such evidence before assuming a crime permits strict liability rather than a mens rea.

* &quot;Strict liability&quot;: the actor engaged in conduct and his mental state is irrelevant. This &quot;mens rea&quot; may only be applied where the forbidden conduct is a mere violation, i.e. a civil infraction.

=== Differences between common law crimes and MPC crimes ===
The elements constituting a crime vary between codes that draw on common law principles and those that draw from the Model Penal Code. For example, the &quot;mens rea&quot; required of murder in federal law under the United States Code is distinct from the &quot;mens rea&quot; of murder under the Texas Penal Code (which adopted the Model Penal Code in 1974):

In the common law approach as under 18 U.S.C. §1111, the definition of murder includes an &quot;actus reus&quot; (the unlawful killing of a human being) and a common law &quot;mens rea&quot;: malice aforethought. Modern criminal law approaches the analysis somewhat differently. Using a framework from the American Law Institute&#x27;s Model Penal Code, homicide is a &quot;results&quot; offense in that it forbids any &quot;purposeful&quot; or &quot;knowing&quot; conduct that causes, and therefore &quot;results&quot; in, the death of another human being. &quot;Purposeful&quot; in this sense means the actor possessed a conscious purpose or objective that the result (i.e. the death of another human being) be achieved. &quot;Knowing&quot; means that the actor was aware or practically certain that a death would result, but had no purpose or desire for it to occur. By contrast with traditional common law, the Model Penal Code specifically distinguishes purpose and knowledge to avoid confusion regarding &quot;intent&quot; elements. Many states still adhere to older terminology, relying on the terms &quot;intentional&quot; to cover both types of &quot;mens rea&quot;: &quot;purposeful&quot; and &quot;knowing&quot;.

=== Limits and criticisms of MPC &quot;mens rea&quot; ===
Not all states have adopted the MPC, and for states that have, application of the Model Code varies. Despite its attempt to standardize criminal law, this variance has resulted in confusion and criticism. Some scholars have criticized the levels of culpability in the current Model Penal Code as insufficient or needing revision. Scholars&#x27; allegations include incoherency from conflicted philosophical commitments, or the federal governments&#x27; failure to explicitly adopt the Model Penal Code resulting in departure from common law precedents. Since the publication of the MPC, confusion has also occurred where norms towards crimes have also changed: especially regarding sexual crimes, hate crimes, drug crimes, and digital crimes. But while some scholarship argues that commitment to reforms gave way to &quot;cynicism and fatigue,&quot; others argue the original commitment of the MPC to &quot;imprisonment as a last result&quot; should be preserved in potential revisions to the Code and criminal law.

Rather than dwell on philosophical or normative arguments, some scholars have looked to evidence-based arguments to update the Code. In an empirical study, participants were presented with scenarios and asked to rate how deserving of punishment the scenario was. The results showed that participants&#x27; judgments matched up with the hierarchy of &quot;mens rea&quot; in the MPC, but also found that participants struggled most with &quot;recklessness&quot; scenarios. As a result, the study suggests revising the language of the categories.

== Modes of culpability outside the United States ==
The levels of &quot;mens rea&quot; and the distinction between them vary among jurisdictions. Although common law originated from England, the common law of each jurisdiction with regard to culpability varies as precedents and statutes vary.

=== England and Wales ===
*&quot;Direct intention&quot;: the actor has a clear foresight of the consequences of his actions, and desires those consequences to occur. It is his aim or purpose to achieve this consequence.
*&quot;Oblique intention&quot;: the result is a virtually certain consequence or a &#x27;virtual certainty&#x27; of the defendant&#x27;s actions, and that the defendant appreciates that such was the case.
*&quot;Knowingly&quot;: the actor knows, or should know, that the results of his conduct are reasonably certain to occur.
*&quot;Recklessness&quot;: the actor foresees that particular consequences may occur and proceeds with the given conduct, not caring whether those consequences actually occur or not.
*&quot;Criminal negligence&quot;: the actor did not actually foresee that the particular consequences would flow from his actions, but a reasonable person, in the same circumstances, would have foreseen those consequences.

=== Scotland ===
*&quot;Intention&quot;: the accused willingly committed a criminal act entirely aware of his actions and their consequences. Necessary for murder and for assault.
*&quot;Recklessness&quot;: the accused was aware the criminal act could be potentially dangerous but did not give a second thought to its consequences, for example, involuntary culpable homicide.

=== Canada ===
The Supreme Court of Canada has found that the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees a minimum requirement for the mental state of various crimes. For example, the crime of murder must include a mental requirement of at least subjective foresight of death. For crimes where imprisonment is a sanction, there is a requirement of at least a defence of due diligence.

=== Australia ===
Mens rea is an element of the offence that the prosecution needs to assert beyond a reasonable doubt for the accused to be found fully liable of the offence, assuming the offence is one that requires an element of mens rea (see, He Kaw Teh v R - case from the Australian High Court regarding importance of establishment of the element of mens rea). Some offences exist whereby an act can be proven but there is lack of the necessary guilt of mind, such can be seen in instances where courts are unable to establish criminal intent due to persistent mental health or cognitive impairment (see, Mental Health and Cognitive Impairment (Forensic Provisions) Act (NSW) s 30). Mens rea can be established both through common law (see R v Morgan) or through statute law. Often in cases where the full guilty mind can not be established, statute law in Australia will provide an alternative sentencing option, such relationship can be seen in the Crimes Act 1900, s33 and 35, where s33(3) states s 35 as an alternate sentence for a finding of Grievous Bodily Harm in the event whereby the Jury is not satified that the accused held the necessary element of specific intent required for criminal liability under s 33. In such instances, s 35 being a charge of recklessness instead of intent, is prescribed.

=== India ===
Mens Rea in the Indian Penal Code 1860 sets out the definition of offences, the general conditions of liability, the conditions of exemptions from liability and punishments for the respective offences. Legislatures had not used the common law doctrine of mens rea in defining these crimes. However, they preferred to import it by using different terms indicating the required evil intent or mens rea as an essence of a particular offence.

Guilt in respect to almost all offences created under the IPC is fastened either on the ground of intention, knowledge or reason to believe. Almost all the offences under the IPC are qualified by one or other words such as &#x27;wrongful gain or loss&#x27;, &#x27;dishonesty&#x27;, &#x27;fraudulently&#x27;, &#x27;reason to believe&#x27;, &#x27;criminal knowledge or intention&#x27;, &#x27;intentional cooperation&#x27;, &#x27;voluntarily&#x27;, &#x27;malignantly&#x27;, &#x27;wantonly&#x27;, &#x27;maliciously&#x27;. All these words indicate the blameworthy mental condition required at the time of commission of the offence, nowhere found in the IPC, its essence is reflected in almost all the provisions of the Indian Penal Code 1860. Every offence created under the IPC virtually imports the idea of criminal intent or mens rea in some form or other.

=== Islamic law ===
In Islamic law, intention (&quot;niyya&quot;) is a criterion for determining whether a criminal act is punishable or pardonable, or whether the penalty for such a crime is predetermined (&quot;ḥadd&quot;) or discretionary (&quot;taʿzīr&quot;). The offender cannot be found guilty until their intention in committing the crime has been taken into consideration.

== Ignorance of law contrasted with &quot;mens rea&quot; ==
The general rule under common law and statutory law is that ignorance of the law or a mistake of law is no defense to criminal prosecution. However, in some cases, courts have held that if knowledge of a law, or if intent to break a law, is a material element of an offense, then a defendant may use good faith ignorance as a defense.

In the 1991 US Supreme Court opinion for &quot;Cheek v. United States&quot;, Byron White wrote: 

Crimes like tax evasion are specific intent crimes and require intent to violate the law as an element of the offense. In &quot;R v. Klundert&quot;, for example, the Ontario Court of Appeal found as follows:

A good-faith belief that a law is unjust or unconstitutional is no excuse, but &quot;reasonable reliance upon an official statement of law, afterward determined to be invalid or erroneous&quot; does not constitute a criminal act.

In the United States, a law must be reasonably clear; it must be worded so that a reasonable layman can comprehend the specific prohibited acts. Otherwise, the law may be unconstitutional pursuant to the vagueness doctrine.

== Subjective and objective tests ==
A hybrid test for the existence of &quot;mens rea&quot; is as follows:
The court will have little difficulty in establishing &quot;mens rea&quot; if there is actual evidencefor instance, if the accused made an admissible admission. This would satisfy a &quot;subjective&quot; test. But a significant proportion of those accused of crimes makes no such admission. Hence, some degree of objectivity must be brought to bear as the basis upon which to impute the necessary components. It is always reasonable to assume that people of ordinary intelligence are aware of their physical surroundings and of the ordinary laws of cause and effect (see causation). Thus, when a person plans what to do and what not to do, they will understand the range of likely outcomes from given behaviour on a sliding scale from &quot;inevitable&quot; to &quot;probable&quot; to &quot;possible&quot; to &quot;improbable&quot;. The more an outcome shades towards the &quot;inevitable&quot; end of the scale, the more likely it is that the accused both foresaw and desired it, and, therefore, the safer it is to impute intention. If there is clear subjective evidence that the accused did &quot;not&quot; have foresight, but a reasonable person would have, the hybrid test may find criminal negligence. In terms of the burden of proof, the requirement is that a jury must have a high degree of certainty before convicting, defined as &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot; in the United States and &quot;sure&quot; in the United Kingdom. It is this reasoning that justifies the defenses of infancy, and of lack of mental capacity under the M&#x27;Naghten Rules, an alternate common law rule (e.g., &quot;Durham&quot; rule), and one of various statutes defining mental illness as an excuse. Moreover, if there is an irrebuttable presumption of &quot;doli incapax&quot; – that is, that the accused did not have sufficient understanding of the nature and quality of his actionsthen the requisite &quot;mens rea&quot; is absent no matter what degree of probability might otherwise have been present. For these purposes, therefore, where the relevant statutes are silent and it is for the common law to form the basis of potential liability, the reasonable person must be endowed with the same intellectual and physical qualities as the accused, and the test must be whether an accused with these specific attributes would have had the requisite foresight and desire.

In English law, s. 8 Criminal Justice Act 1967 provides a statutory framework within which &quot;mens rea&quot; is assessed. It states:
Under s. 8(b), therefore, the jury is allowed a wide latitude in applying a hybrid test to impute intention or foresight (for the purposes of recklessness) on the basis of all the evidence.

== Relevance of motive ==
One of the mental components often raised in issue is that of motive. If the accused admits to having a motive consistent with the elements of foresight and desire, this will add to the level of probability that the actual outcome was intended (it makes the prosecution case more credible). But if there is clear evidence that the accused had a different motive, this may decrease the probability that he or she desired the actual outcome. In such a situation, the motive may become subjective evidence that the accused did not intend, but was reckless or willfully blind.

Motive cannot normally be a defense. If, for example, a person breaks into a laboratory used for the testing of pharmaceuticals on animals, the question of guilt is determined by the presence of an &quot;actus reus&quot;, i.e. entry without consent and damage to property, and a &quot;mens rea&quot;, i.e. intention to enter and cause the damage. That the person might have had a clearly articulated political motive to protest such testing does not affect liability. If motive has any relevance, this may be addressed in the sentencing part of the trial, when the court considers what punishment, if any, is appropriate.

Rarely, a motive may amount to a defence if it is specifically allowed in law, or is protected as a right (for example, if a conviction for crimes committed during a protest would unduly interfere with free speech rights; see &quot;DPP v Ziegler&quot;).

== Recklessness (United States: &quot;willful blindness&quot;) ==

In such cases, there is clear subjective evidence that the accused foresaw but did not desire the particular outcome. When the accused failed to stop the given behavior, he took the risk of causing the given loss or damage. There is always some degree of intention subsumed within recklessness. During the course of the conduct, the accused foresees that he may be putting another at risk of injury: A choice must be made at that point in time. By deciding to proceed, the accused actually intends the other to be exposed to the risk of that injury. The greater the probability of that risk maturing into the foreseen injury, the greater the degree of recklessness and, subsequently, sentence rendered. In common law, for example, an unlawful homicide committed recklessly would ordinarily constitute the crime of involuntary manslaughter. One committed with &quot;extreme&quot; or &quot;gross&quot; recklessness as to human life would constitute murder, sometimes defined as &quot;depraved heart&quot; or &quot;abandoned and malignant heart&quot; or &quot;depraved indifference&quot; murder.

== Criminal negligence ==
Here, the test is both subjective and objective. There is credible subjective evidence that the particular accused neither foresaw nor desired the particular outcome, thus potentially excluding both intention and recklessness. But a reasonable person with the same abilities and skills as the accused would have foreseen and taken precautions to prevent the loss and damage being sustained. Only a small percentage of offences are defined with this &quot;mens rea&quot; requirement. Most legislatures prefer to base liability on either intention or recklessness and, faced with the need to establish recklessness as the default &quot;mens rea&quot; for guilt, those practising in most legal systems rely heavily on objective tests to establish the minimum requirement of foresight for recklessness.

== Consciousness of guilt ==

Consciousness of guilt is a type of circumstantial evidence of criminal intent that judges, prosecutors, and juries may consider when weighing the relative guilt or innocence of a defendant. It is admissible evidence, and judges are required to instruct juries on this form of evidence. Deceptive statements, failure to cooperate with authorities, or evasive actions made by a defendant after the commission of a crime or other wrongdoing are seen as evidence of a guilty conscience. These are not the typical behaviors of an innocent person, and a &quot;defendant&#x27;s actions are compared unfavorably to what a normal, innocent person would have done, with the implication that the discrepancy indicates guilt&quot;.

<text>Geastrales is an order of gasterocarpic basidiomycetes (fungi) that are related to Gomphales. The order contains the families Geastraceae, which includes the &quot;earthstars&quot; formerly placed in Lycoperdales or Phallales, and also Schenellaceae, Sclerogastraceae and Sphaerobolaceae.

About 160 species are classified in this order, divided among seven or eight genera, including &quot;Geastrum&quot;, &quot;Myriostoma&quot; and &quot;Sphaerobolus&quot;. &quot;Sphaerobolus&quot; species are known as &quot;shotgun fungus&quot; or &quot;cannonball fungus&quot;. They colonize wood-based mulches and may throw black, sticky, spore-containing globs onto nearby surfaces.

In &quot;Geastrum&quot;, once mature, the exoperidium splits into a variable number of rays, which give them their visible star shape. The exoperidial rays are there to protect the endoperidial body and orchestrate spore dispersal. The fruiting bodies of several earthstars are hygrometric: in dry weather the rays will dry and curl up around the soft spore sac, protecting it. In this state, often the whole fungus becomes detached from the ground and may roll around like a tumbleweed. In wetter weather, the rays moisten and uncurl; some even curl backward lifting the spore sac up. This allows rain or animals to hit the spore sac, emitting spores when enough moisture is present for them to germinate and establish.

<text>Pet Shop Boys are an English synth-pop duo formed in London in 1981. Consisting of the vocalist Neil Tennant and the keyboardist Chris Lowe, they have sold more than 100 million records worldwide and were listed as the most successful duo in UK music history in the 1999 edition of &quot;The Guinness Book of Records&quot;.

Pet Shop Boys have achieved 42 top 30 singles, including 22 top-10 hits on the UK singles chart, including four UK number-ones: &quot;West End Girls&quot; (also number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100), &quot;It&#x27;s a Sin&quot;, a synth-pop version of &quot;Always on My Mind&quot;, and &quot;Heart&quot;. Other hit songs include a cover of &quot;Go West&quot;, and their own &quot;Opportunities (Let&#x27;s Make Lots of Money)&quot;, and &quot;What Have I Done to Deserve This?&quot; in a duet with Dusty Springfield. With five US top 10 singles in the 1980s, they are associated with the Second British Invasion.

Pet Shop Boys have won three Brit Awards and have been nominated for Grammy Awards. At the 2009 Brit Awards in London, they received an award for Outstanding Contribution to Music. In 2016, &quot;Billboard&quot; named Pet Shop Boys the number one dance duo or group since the chart&#x27;s inception in 1976. In 2017, the duo received &quot;NME&quot; Godlike Genius Award, and in 2024, they were awarded the Pop Pioneers award at the MTV Europe Music Awards.

==History==
===Early years (1981–1984)===
Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe met in a hi-fi shop, Chelsea Record Centre, at 203 King&#x27;s Road, in Chelsea, London, on 19 August 1981. Tennant needed a connector for a Korg MS-10 synthesiser he had purchased, which sparked a conversation with Lowe. Discovering that they had a mutual interest in disco and electronic music, they became friends. In particular, the pair drew inspiration from two synth-pop records: &quot;Souvenir&quot; by Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD); and &quot;Bedsitter&quot; by Soft Cell, which reflected their lifestyles at the time. According to Tennant, he and Lowe would listen to &quot;pioneers of electronic music&quot;, including OMD, Soft Cell, Kraftwerk, the Human League, and Depeche Mode.

The duo began to work together on material, first in Tennant&#x27;s flat in Chelsea, then, from 1982, in a small studio in Camden Town owned by Ray Roberts. &quot;Jealousy&quot;, written in 1982, was among the first songs they recorded there. They briefly labelled their demo tapes under the band name West End before settling on Pet Shop Boys. They say that their band name was taken from friends who worked in a pet shop in Ealing and were known as the &quot;pet shop boys&quot;. They also noted a naming similarity with the recently formed rap rock group Beastie Boys. In August 1983, Tennant, who was an assistant editor at &quot;Smash Hits&quot;, went to New York to interview Sting. While there, he arranged to meet hi-NRG producer Bobby Orlando and gave him a demo tape containing &quot;It&#x27;s a Sin&quot; and &quot;Opportunities (Let&#x27;s Make Lots of Money)&quot;.

From 1983 to 1984, Orlando recorded a number of tracks with Tennant and Lowe, including &quot;Two Divided by Zero&quot;, &quot;West End Girls&quot;, &quot;Opportunities (Let&#x27;s Make Lots of Money)&quot;, &quot;A Man Could Get Arrested&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s My Impression&quot;, &quot;Pet Shop Boys&quot;, &quot;One More Chance&quot;, &quot;Rent&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s a Sin&quot;, &quot;I Get Excited&quot;, and &quot;To Speak Is a Sin&quot;. In April 1984, the Orlando-produced &quot;West End Girls&quot; was released, becoming a club hit in Los Angeles and San Francisco. On 2 November, it was voted &quot;Screamer of the Week&quot; by listeners of Long Island, New York, radio station WLIR. It was a minor dance hit in Belgium and France, but was only available in the United Kingdom as a 12&quot; import.

===&quot;Please&quot; (1984–1986)===
In March 1985, after long negotiations, Pet Shop Boys cut their contractual ties with Orlando, with a settlement giving him significant royalties for future sales. Hiring manager Tom Watkins, they signed with the London-based Parlophone label. In April, Tennant left &quot;Smash Hits&quot; magazine—where he had progressed to the position of deputy editor—and in July, a new single, &quot;Opportunities (Let&#x27;s Make Lots of Money)&quot;, was released, reaching number 116 in the UK. The B-side to this single, &quot;In the Night&quot;, later resurfaced, in a longer remixed version, as the opening track to the duo&#x27;s first remix album, &quot;Disco&quot;, in 1986. This version was also used as the theme for the UK television series &quot;The Clothes Show&quot;.

They returned to the studio in August to re-record &quot;West End Girls&quot; with producer Stephen Hague. Released in October 1985 it rose slowly in the British charts to become number one in January 1986. It subsequently replicated this success in the United States, Canada, Finland, Hong Kong, Ireland, Israel, New Zealand and Norway and sold an estimated 1.5 million copies worldwide.

After the success of &quot;West End Girls&quot;, Pet Shop Boys released a follow-up single, &quot;Love Comes Quickly&quot;, on 24 February 1986. The single reached number nineteen on the UK Singles Chart and was followed by their debut album, &quot;Please&quot;, on 24 March. In June 1986, the band announced a tour of Europe and America; however, their plans for a theatrical extravaganza proved to be too expensive and the tour was cancelled. &quot;Please&quot; started Pet Shop Boys&#x27; tradition of choosing one-word album titles, which Neil Tennant has since stated is now a Pet Shop Boys &quot;signature thing&quot;, akin to e. e. cummings&#x27; use of exclusively lower case letters. New versions of their second single, &quot;Opportunities (Let&#x27;s Make Lots of Money)&quot;, and the album track &quot;Suburbia&quot; were also released in 1986, followed by &quot;Disco&quot;. In September 1986, Pet Shop Boys performed &quot;Love Comes Quickly&quot; and &quot;West End Girls&quot; at the 1986 MTV Video Music Awards in Los Angeles.

===&quot;Actually&quot; (1987–1988)===
In 1987, Pet Shop Boys received both a BRIT Award and Ivor Novello Award for &quot;West End Girls&quot;. On 15 June, they released what became their second number one single, &quot;It&#x27;s a Sin&quot;. The single caused some controversy: Tennant&#x27;s school, St. Cuthbert&#x27;s Grammar School in Newcastle upon Tyne, chastised him in the &quot;Evening Chronicle&quot;, while pop impresario Jonathan King accused them of plagiarising the Cat Stevens song &quot;Wild World&quot;. King recorded a version of &quot;Wild World&quot; in the style of Pet Shop Boys to prove his point. The group later sued King and won damages, which were donated to Jefferiss Research Trust, supporting the study of sexually transmitted diseases. The music video for &quot;It&#x27;s a Sin&quot; was their first collaboration with director Derek Jarman.

The success of &quot;It&#x27;s a Sin&quot; was followed up with the release of &quot;What Have I Done to Deserve This?&quot; on 10 August. Co-written with Allee Willis and also featuring Dusty Springfield on vocals, the single reached number two on the UK Singles Chart and the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. Although the duo had wanted to release this track on their debut album, Springfield had not agreed, and they were reluctant to record it with any other female singer, despite their record company&#x27;s suggestions. Springfield&#x27;s manager finally contacted them in 1986, following the release of &quot;Please&quot;, and towards the end of that year, she travelled to London to record &quot;What Have I Done to Deserve This?&quot; with them. It was the first track to be recorded for the duo&#x27;s second album, &quot;Actually&quot;. Pet Shop Boys had been told that Springfield was difficult to work with and even that she could no longer sing; however, her performance on the track put any such concerns to rest and they began a collaboration with her, which lasted until the end of the decade. The song resurrected Springfield&#x27;s career, leading to her 1990 album, &quot;Reputation&quot;, on which Pet Shop Boys were major contributing writers and producers. This duet was also the start of a series of collaborations with high-profile musicians, going on throughout the band&#x27;s career.

&quot;Actually&quot; was released in September 1987, followed by the single &quot;Rent&quot; in October, which reached number eight in the UK. The last track on the album, &quot;King&#x27;s Cross&quot;, accidentally anticipated the King&#x27;s Cross fire at the London Underground section of the station in November of that year (part of the lyrics read: &quot;Dead and wounded on either side/You know it&#x27;s only a matter of time&quot;). &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper in the UK subsequently tried to get the track released as a charity single, but Pet Shop Boys did not agree.

At the end of the year, &quot;Always on My Mind&quot; became both the duo&#x27;s third number one single in the UK and the Christmas number one single for 1987, beating &quot;Fairytale of New York&quot; by The Pogues and Kirsty MacColl. Pet Shop Boys had selected the song for an appearance on &quot;Love Me Tender&quot;, an ITV programme commemorating the tenth anniversary of Elvis Presley&#x27;s death, and decided to release it. The song was not included on &quot;Actually&quot;, prompting EMI to repackage the album in the U.S. with a 12&quot; version of the single; an extended version, &quot;Always on My Mind/In My House&quot;, was later included on &quot;Introspective&quot; (1988). In November 2004, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; newspaper placed Pet Shop Boys&#x27; version of &quot;Always on My Mind&quot; at number two in a list of the fifty greatest cover versions of all time.

To capitalise on their string of hits, and in lieu of a tour, Pet Shop Boys made a film that incorporated songs from &quot;Please&quot; and &quot;Actually&quot;. Working with director Jack Bond, the project grew into a full-scale movie, &quot;It Couldn&#x27;t Happen Here&quot;, starring Barbara Windsor, Joss Ackland and Gareth Hunt. Footage from the film was used in the music video for &quot;Always on My Mind&quot;. The film was released in 1988 to mixed reviews.

&quot;Heart&quot;, released in March 1988 as the last single from &quot;Actually&quot;, was Pet Shop Boys&#x27; fourth UK number one hit and their last to date. The video for the single, directed by Jack Bond, starred Ian McKellen as a vampire.

Pet Shop Boys wrote and produced the song &quot;I&#x27;m Not Scared&quot; for Patsy Kensit&#x27;s band, Eighth Wonder. The song, released in February 1988, became her biggest hit single. Pet Shop Boys recorded their own version of the track for their album &quot;Introspective&quot; later that year.

===&quot;Introspective&quot; and &quot;Behaviour&quot; (1988–1992)===
Neil Tennant has said that the Pet Shop Boys&#x27; &quot;Imperial Phase&quot; ended in September 1988, when their new single, &quot;Domino Dancing&quot;, entered the UK Singles Chart at number nine and only reached number seven. Tennant recalls being disappointed upon hearing the news, and he felt that their peak period was over and that it was going to be a challenge to maintain their level of success in the future.

Their third album, &quot;Introspective&quot;, was released on 10 October 1988. Unusually, this was a six-track album of previously unheard remixes and new tracks in extended form. It was followed by the Trevor Horn–produced top-five single &quot;Left to My Own Devices&quot;, and a cover version of the Sterling Void song &quot;It&#x27;s Alright&quot;. Pet Shop Boys embarked on their first tour in 1989, performing in Hong Kong, Japan, and Britain. The tour followed the ideas of the extravaganza that could not have been afforded earlier in their careers. Derek Jarman returned to direct the performance and he provided several films that were projected during the shows.

The September 1990 single, &quot;So Hard&quot; reached number four in the UK and was followed by their fourth studio album, &quot;Behaviour&quot;, which was recorded in Munich with producer Harold Faltermeyer. The album was not intended to reflect a dramatic change in mood from their earlier albums; however, it is noticeably subdued. It included the fan favourite &quot;Being Boring&quot;, the second single from the album, which only reached number 20 on the UK Singles Chart, their lowest placing at the time. The title is from a quote by Zelda Fitzgerald: &quot;...she refused to be bored chiefly because she wasn&#x27;t boring&quot;, and the song was a personal commentary on the AIDS epidemic. The music video was directed by filmmaker Bruce Weber. By this time, the duo had parted ways with manager Tom Watkins, replacing him with Jill Carrington, who had previously been marketing director at Polydor.

In March 1991, a cover of U2&#x27;s &quot;Where the Streets Have No Name&quot; as a medley with &quot;Can&#x27;t Take My Eyes Off You&quot;, the 1960s pop song by Frankie Valli/the Four Seasons, was released as a double-A-sided single with a remix of the album track &quot;How Can You Expect to Be Taken Seriously?&quot; by Brothers in Rhythm. This was followed by the duo&#x27;s first world tour. Named &quot;Performance&quot;, the tour kicked off in Tokyo, on 11 March 1991, and visited the United States, Canada, France, Belgium, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Czechoslovakia, Austria, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Ireland and the United Kingdom. The shows were designed by David Alden and David Fielding, who had designed several sets for the Royal Opera House.

Before taking a break in 1992, Pet Shop Boys released an 18-track compilation called &quot;&quot; (1991), which included all of their single releases up until then and two new singles—&quot;DJ Culture&quot; and &quot;Was It Worth It?&quot;—omitting only &quot;How Can You Expect to Be Taken Seriously?&quot; (although it did appear on the video companion &quot;Videography&quot;). While &quot;DJ Culture&quot; had some success, &quot;Was It Worth It?&quot; became the duo&#x27;s first single to miss the UK top 20 since their two Bobby O debut singles.

During this period, Pet Shop Boys continued to collaborate with many high-profile musicians. They worked again with Dusty Springfield, on the singles &quot;Nothing Has Been Proved&quot;, recorded for the film &quot;Scandal&quot; about the Profumo political scandal, and &quot;In Private&quot;. The duo later went on to produce half of the tracks on her 1990 solo &quot;Reputation&quot; album. Pet Shop Boys were also asked to write and produce an album for Liza Minnelli, in 1989. The album, &quot;Results&quot;, generated four singles, including the hit &quot;Losing My Mind&quot;, a cover version of the Stephen Sondheim song from the 1971 Broadway musical &quot;Follies&quot;. The duo&#x27;s own demo of this appeared on their &quot;Jealousy&quot; single as a B-side.

Tennant worked with Bernard Sumner and Johnny Marr on their first album as Electronic, whose first single, &quot;Getting Away with It&quot;, co-written and co-produced by Tennant, was released on 4 December 1989. In 1991, Lowe also contributed to the Electronic project, contributing the chord sequence to &quot;The Patience of a Saint&quot; on their 1991 album. In 1992, Tennant sang lead vocals on the non-album single &quot;Disappointed&quot;, which was featured on the soundtrack to the film &quot;Cool World&quot;. Pet Shop Boys set up the Spaghetti Records label in 1991. Their most successful release was the soundtrack to the 1992 film &quot;The Crying Game&quot;, which featured Boy George performing a cover of Dave Berry&#x27;s 1964 song &quot;The Crying Game&quot;. The song was produced by Pet Shop Boys and featured Tennant on backing vocals. Other artists on the label included Scottish singer Cicero, the Ignorants, and Masterboy.

In 1992, they were the subjects of a &quot;South Bank Show&quot; documentary on ITV with contributions from Liza Minnelli, Eric Watson (photographer and video director), Simon Frith (music critic), David Alden and David Fielding.

===&quot;Very&quot; and &quot;Disco 2&quot; (1993–1995)===
In June 1993, Pet Shop Boys re-invented their image and made a strong return to the UK Singles Chart with &quot;Can You Forgive Her?&quot;. Taking its title from the Anthony Trollope novel of the same name, the single reached number seven on the UK Singles Chart, while its iconic music video featured the duo in orange body suits and tall dunce caps, in a world of computer-generated imagery. The theme was continued with the follow-up single, a cover of the Village People song &quot;Go West&quot;, which reached number two in the UK, with another computer-generated music video, this time inspired by the Soviet Union, with shots of the duo filmed in Moscow. The tune was adopted as a football chant at Arsenal Football Club, which Chris Lowe supports, and it became a widespread and iconic stadium anthem.

The duo&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;Very&quot;, followed on 27 September and is the only Pet Shop Boys album to reach number one on the UK Albums Chart. It was produced by Pet Shop Boys and mixed with additional production by Stephen Hague, who had worked with them on their first album and had subsequently made records with OMD, New Order and Erasure. The other singles from &quot;Very&quot;, &quot;I Wouldn&#x27;t Normally Do This Kind of Thing&quot;, &quot;Liberation&quot; and &quot;Yesterday, When I Was Mad&quot;, continued the theme of CGI videos, peaking with the &quot;Liberation&quot; video, which contained almost no real-life elements at all. All these videos were directed by Howard Greenhalgh, who continued to work with Pet Shop Boys well into the next decade. &quot;Very&quot; was also released in a limited edition including an entirely new album, &quot;Relentless&quot;, which was composed of six all-new progressive house tracks.

In 1994, Pet Shop Boys offered to remix fellow Parlophone act Blur&#x27;s single &quot;Girls &amp; Boys&quot;. It was a club hit throughout Europe and started a sporadic trend for Pet Shop Boys to remix other artists&#x27; music. Also in 1994, Pet Shop Boys released the Comic Relief single, &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot;. The idea started when Tennant and Lowe were playing around with samples from the BBC sitcom &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot; in the studio. They approached lead actors Jennifer Saunders and Joanna Lumley and suggested it as a charity single. It was released under the artist name &#x27;Absolutely Fabulous&#x27;; Tennant and Lowe do not consider it as a Pet Shop Boys single release and it was not included on their next best-of album. The video featured clips from the sitcom, along with newly recorded footage of Tennant and Lowe with the characters of Edina (Saunders) and Patsy (Lumley).

On 12 September 1994, Pet Shop Boys released the follow-up to their 1986 remix album &quot;Disco&quot;, in the form of &quot;Disco 2&quot;. The album featured club remixes of the singles released from &quot;Very&quot; and &quot;Behaviour&quot;, in a continuous megamix by Danny Rampling. Then, in October, Pet Shop Boys began their &quot;Discovery&quot; tour, visiting areas that they had never performed in before: Singapore, Australia, Puerto Rico, Mexico, Colombia, Chile, Argentina and Brazil. The following year, a new version of &quot;Paninaro&quot;, the 1986 B-side to &quot;Suburbia&quot;, was released to promote the B-sides collection &quot;Alternative&quot;. The single, called &quot;Paninaro &#x27;95&quot;, is based on the live version from the &quot;Discovery&quot; tour.

===&quot;Bilingual&quot; and &quot;Nightlife&quot; (1996–2001)===

The Pet Shop Boys remix of the David Bowie song &quot;Hallo Spaceboy&quot; featured Tennant on backing vocals and was released in the UK on 19 February 1996. Pet Shop Boys then joined Bowie during his performance of the song at the 1996 Brit Awards ceremony, as well as an appearance on the &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; television programme. Tina Turner released her &quot;Wildest Dreams&quot; album in April, featuring the song &quot;Confidential&quot;, written and co-produced by Pet Shop Boys.

The Pet Shop Boys single &quot;Before&quot; reached number seven on the UK Singles Chart in April. In August, they released a follow-up single, &quot;Se a vida é (That&#x27;s the Way Life Is)&quot;, a Latin American music-inspired track, featuring a drum sample from a track called &quot;Estrada da paixão&quot; by Brazilian act Olodum. This preceded the sixth Pet Shop Boys album &quot;Bilingual&quot;, which was released in September.

Pet Shop Boys were the first band to have a residency at a West End theatre, playing for two weeks at the Savoy Theatre in June 1997. Lowe selected the song &quot;Somewhere&quot; from &quot;West Side Story&quot; to be the centrepiece of the performance and a new single. The production featured an interactive film by Sam Taylor-Wood showing a party scene, which Tennant and Lowe appeared to leave and enter from the stage. The show lost money, and the duo offset their losses in part by playing music festivals including the Roskilde Festival in 1997 and Creamfields in 1999.

The majority of 1998 was spent with a series of live dates and minor releases, including a charity album of Noël Coward songs, called &quot;Twentieth Century Blues&quot;. The album included Pet Shop Boys&#x27; version of &quot;Sail Away&quot;, along with songs performed by Elton John, Texas, Marianne Faithfull, The Divine Comedy, Suede, Damon Albarn, Vic Reeves and Robbie Williams. Tennant also co-produced the Williams track and provided backing vocals for Elton John. Tennant provided backing vocals on Robbie Williams&#x27; &quot;No Regrets&quot; single, along with Neil Hannon from The Divine Comedy. Meanwhile, the band switched managers again as Carrington resigned and was succeeded by Mitch Clark, who had previously worked for EMI International as Head of Promotion.

During this time, Pet Shop Boys began to work with playwright Jonathan Harvey on a stage musical project. In 1999, many of the tracks they recorded ended up on their seventh studio album, &quot;Nightlife&quot;, including &quot;Closer to Heaven&quot;, which would later become the title song of their musical. &quot;Nightlife&quot; produced the top 10 hit &quot;You Only Tell Me You Love Me When You&#x27;re Drunk&quot; and the top 20 singles &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know What You Want But I Can&#x27;t Give It Any More&quot; and &quot;New York City Boy&quot;. The album also featured a duet with Kylie Minogue, &quot;In Denial&quot;, about a father coming out to his daughter. Minogue later performed the track live, during her 2005 &quot;&quot; tour, singing to a pre-recorded Neil Tennant. This was not the first time that Pet Shop Boys worked with Minogue: In 1994, they wrote a song for her eponymous &quot;Kylie Minogue&quot; album, called &quot;Falling&quot;, which was based on an unreleased remix of &quot;Go West&quot; with new lyrics by Tennant; however, Minogue and her record company did not like the style of Pet Shop Boys&#x27; demo and asked Farley &amp; Heller to produce the track.

In 2000 the duo made their debut performance at the Glastonbury festival on the pyramid stage on Saturday 24 June as the sun was setting, before Travis headlined. Cerys Matthews of Catatonia took the part of Dusty Springfield for the duet on &quot;What Have I Done to Deserve This?&quot;. The performance was heralded as one of the weekend&#x27;s most triumphant.

The musical &quot;Closer to Heaven&quot; premiered in London in May 2001 to mixed reviews. The run was originally extended to February 2002, but it closed in October 2001 along with a number of other productions after the 11 September 2001 attacks.

===&quot;Release&quot; (2002–2005)===
Following the mixed fortunes of &quot;Closer to Heaven&quot;, Pet Shop Boys returned to the studio to start work on their eighth album. After toying with genres including hip hop, they went for a stripped back acoustic sound as a complete change from the over-the-top dance music of the musical. In 2002, they released the modestly successful album &quot;Release&quot;. Most of the tracks were produced by the duo themselves and many featured Johnny Marr on guitar. The first single, &quot;Home and Dry&quot;, featured a very peculiar music video, directed by Wolfgang Tillmans, mostly consisting of raw camcorder footage of mice filmed in the London Underground. The follow-up single &quot;I Get Along&quot; had a video filmed by Bruce Weber.

Pet Shop Boys embarked on another world tour, although this time it was a stripped back affair, with no dancers, backing singers, costumes or lavish sets. They used two extra guitarists, Bic Hayes and Mark Refoy, percussionist Dawne Adams, and regular programmer Pete Gleadall, alongside Lowe on keyboards and Tennant on guitar and vocals. They started with a tour of universities around the UK, performing at Bristol University, Keele University, University of East Anglia in Norwich, University of Teesside, Middlesbrough and De Montfort University, Leicester. Subsequent dates took them to Germany, the U.S., Canada, Spain, Italy, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, then another series of dates in the UK, and on to Switzerland, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, and then a first-ever date in Thailand as the final show, at the large Bangkok Impact Arena. 

A third single, &quot;London&quot;, was released in Germany at the request of EMI Germany. It was never planned for release in the UK, although a promotional video was shot by the distinguished photographer Martin Parr and it was serviced to some UK radio stations. Following a live stint on the John Peel show on Radio 1, Pet Shop Boys released &quot;Disco 3&quot;, in February 2003. The album followed their previous &quot;Disco&quot; albums, but this one also included new songs as well as remixes.

In 2003, Pet Shop Boys launched two new labels, Olde English Vinyl and Lucky Kunst, their Spaghetti Records label becoming defunct. The first release on Olde English Vinyl was Atomizer&#x27;s &quot;Hooked on Radiation&quot;, followed by Pete Burns&#x27; &quot;Jack and Jill Party&quot; in 2004. The only Lucky Kunst release to date is the Kiki Kokova&#x27;s version of &quot;Love to Love You Baby&quot;. They also remixed Yoko Ono&#x27;s &quot;Walking on Thin Ice&quot; in 2003 and Rammstein&#x27;s &quot;Mein Teil&quot; in 2004. Another new manager, David Dorrell, was brought on board to replace Clark. In November 2003, Pet Shop Boys released a second greatest hits album, &quot;&quot;, a double compilation with two new singles: &quot;Miracles&quot; and &quot;Flamboyant&quot;. Not chronologically arranged, the tracks were divided into two discs: &quot;Pop&quot; including the more traditional pop songs and &quot;Art&quot; containing those works which were considered more experimental.

In September 2004, Pet Shop Boys appeared at a free concert in Trafalgar Square in London, where they performed, with the Dresdner Sinfoniker orchestra, a whole new soundtrack to accompany the seminal 1925 silent film &quot;Battleship Potemkin&quot;. There were four further live performances of the work with the Dresdner Sinfoniker in Germany in September 2005. The &quot;Battleship Potemkin&quot; soundtrack was then released on 5 September 2005. In November 2004, Pet Shop Boys played at the Prince&#x27;s Trust concert titled &quot;Produced by Trevor Horn&quot; with other artists who had worked with Trevor Horn, including Grace Jones, ABC, Seal and Frankie Goes to Hollywood. In 2005, Pet Shop Boys were selected as the headline act for the Moscow Live 8 concert, in Red Square, where a crowd of between 60,000 and 80,000 gathered to watch them perform. Also in 2005, Pet Shop Boys were asked to put together &quot;Back to Mine: Pet Shop Boys&quot;, the twentieth release in an ongoing series showcasing artists&#x27; favourite music selections, with an emphasis on afterhours chill-out music. As a condition, Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe were given one disc each, whereas all previous releases in the series consisted of only a single disc per group.

In July 2017, Pet Shop Boys reissued &quot;Release&quot; as part of their &quot;Catalogue: 1985–2012&quot; series. It features the remastered album, plus bonus tracks, demos and Pet Shop Boys&#x27; remixes of their tracks.

===&quot;Fundamental&quot; (2006–2008)===

Pet Shop Boys began 2006 remixing Madonna&#x27;s single &quot;Sorry&quot;, for release in February. The single reached number one in the UK and the Pet Shop Boys remix included new backing vocals performed by Tennant. Madonna subsequently used the Pet Shop Boys remix, including Tennant&#x27;s vocals, on her 2006 Confessions Tour. 

In April, Pet Shop Boys released a new single that reached number eight in the UK, &quot;I&#x27;m with Stupid&quot;, a commentary on the relationship between George W. Bush and Tony Blair. The promo video featured Matt Lucas and David Walliams, better known as the team behind &quot;Little Britain&quot;. Lucas and Walliams portray Lowe and Tennant, parodying two of the duo&#x27;s previous videos, &quot;Go West&quot;, and &quot;Can You Forgive Her?&quot;. The ninth Pet Shop Boys studio album, &quot;Fundamental&quot;, followed in May, reaching number five in the UK. The album was produced by Trevor Horn, who Pet Shop Boys had previously worked with on &quot;Left to My Own Devices&quot;, in 1988. The album was also released with a limited edition remix album called &quot;Fundamentalism&quot;, which included a version of &quot;In Private&quot; as a duet with Elton John and &quot;Fugitive&quot;, a new track produced by Richard X.

The week that &quot;Fundamental&quot; was released, a documentary, titled &quot;Pet Shop Boys: A Life in Pop&quot;, was broadcast on Channel 4, directed by George Scott and produced by Nick de Grunwald. The original broadcast was less than an hour in duration; a 140-minute version was released on DVD in October 2006. Contributors to the programme included Robbie Williams, Brandon Flowers, Tim Rice-Oxley, Jake Shears and Bruce Weber. The DVD also contained promo videos that had been made since the release of &quot;PopArt&quot;.

The second single to be taken from the album was the UK top twenty &quot;Minimal&quot;. The duo filmed the video to the single in Paris with Don Cameron. The single was the first of theirs to be playlisted by London&#x27;s biggest radio station, Capital Radio, in a decade. Pet Shop Boys began a worldwide tour in support of &quot;Fundamental&quot; in June 2006 in Norway. The show was designed and directed by Es Devlin, a British theatre designer, and choreographed by Hakeem Onibudo. Between 15 June and 10 September 2006, Pet Shop Boys played a series of concert dates across Europe, mainly at assorted festivals and outdoor venues. These included two dates at the Tower of London on 28 and 29 June and a single show at Thetford Forest, as well as performances of &quot;Battleship Potemkin&quot; in Germany and Spain. On 1 May 2006, &quot;Battleship Potemkin&quot; was also performed at the Swan Hunter shipyard, in Newcastle upon Tyne, with Pet Shop Boys accompanied by the Northern Sinfonia orchestra.

On 3 October 2006, the long-delayed U.S. release of their &quot;PopArt&quot; hits package was issued by Capitol Records. During 2006, Pet Shop Boys worked with Robbie Williams on his album &quot;Rudebox&quot;, producing two tracks: a cover version of &quot;We&#x27;re the Pet Shop Boys&quot;, written by My Robot Friend (which Pet Shop Boys had also recorded themselves and released as a B-side to &quot;Miracles&quot; in 2003), and &quot;She&#x27;s Madonna&quot;, a duet with Tennant. On 10 October 2006, Pet Shop Boys embarked on the North and Central American leg of their world tour, which took them through Canada, the United States and Mexico, concluding on 16 November. A DVD of the show in Mexico City was released on 21 May 2007, titled &quot;Cubism&quot;. It was recorded on 14 November 2006, in the Auditorio Nacional, and was directed by David Barnard.

On 16 October, &quot;Catalogue&quot; was published by Thames &amp; Hudson, a 336-page hardcover book written by Philip Hoare and Chris Heath, detailing their entire visual output, including photography as well as the design of albums, music videos, concert tours, books and fan club magazines from 1984 to 2004. Neil Tennant comments in the book: &quot;In the beginning we made a decision – and it was in our EMI contract – that that we would have control over how everything worked; that obviously the songs mattered hugely, but the way they were presented was going to matter hugely as well; and that we were never going to give up on that.&quot; Pet Shop Boys supported the publication of the book with signings in London, New York City, Los Angeles and Berlin. To coincide with the publication of &quot;Catalogue&quot;, a small exhibition of portraits of Pet Shop Boys opened in the Bookshop Gallery of London&#x27;s National Portrait Gallery on 30 October 2006 and ran to 4 March 2007.

Also on 16 October, the third single from &quot;Fundamental&quot;, &quot;Numb&quot;, written by Diane Warren, was released, following its appearance at the end of the BBC&#x27;s coverage of England at the World Cup. &quot;Numb&quot; became only the second Pet Shop Boys single to that point to miss the Top 20.

On 23 October 2006, &quot;Concrete&quot; was released. It is a double CD of the complete Mermaid Theatre concert, with the BBC Concert Orchestra, featuring guests Rufus Wainwright, Frances Barber, and Robbie Williams, and Trevor Horn as the musical director. A 90-minute &quot;director&#x27;s cut&quot; of the concert aired on BBC 6 Music, on 28 August 2006. On 7 December 2006, Pet Shop Boys were nominated for two 2007 Grammy Awards: Best Dance Recording for &quot;I&#x27;m with Stupid&quot;, and Best Electronic/Dance Album for &quot;Fundamental&quot;. During the latter part of 2006 and early 2007, Neil Tennant served as executive producer on Rufus Wainwright&#x27;s album, &quot;Release the Stars&quot;, recorded in Berlin. He sang backing vocals on a number of tracks, including &quot;Do I Disappoint You&quot;, and &quot;Tiergarten&quot;.

Pet Shop Boys continued their world tour, albeit with a slightly different production and set list, on 14 March 2007, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, then played concerts in Argentina, Chile, New Zealand and Australia (as co-headliners of the V Festival 2007), Norway, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Germany, Switzerland, France, the Netherlands, Great Britain, Denmark, Ireland, Sweden, Italy, Spain, Belgium and Singapore. Pet Shop Boys &quot;played&quot; at the free festival Secondfest, in the online virtual world &quot;Second Life&quot;, on 30 June. The Fundamental tour ended in Bucharest, Romania, in November 2007.

On 8 October 2007, Pet Shop Boys released &quot;Disco 4&quot;, the latest in their series of remix albums; the fourth in the set differed in that it was largely made up of remixes, completed by Pet Shop Boys, of other artists&#x27; work over the past decade. These include The Killers, David Bowie, Yoko Ono, Madonna, Atomizer and Rammstein. Only two tracks by Pet Shop Boys, remixed versions of &quot;Fundamental&quot; tracks &quot;Integral&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m with Stupid&quot;, were included.

In October 2008, Pet Shop Boys released the single &quot;I&#x27;m in Love with a German Film Star&quot; featuring British photographer Sam Taylor-Wood on vocals. This single was made for her exhibition in London and it was released by Kompakt records in Germany, on both CD and 7&quot; and 12&quot; vinyl. The most notable remixes were by Gui Boratto, Jurgen Paape and Mark Reeder.

In July 2017, Pet Shop Boys reissued &quot;Fundamental&quot; as part of their &quot;Catalogue: 1985–2012&quot; series. It features the remastered album, plus bonus tracks, demos and Pet Shop Boys&#x27; remixes of their tracks.

===&quot;Yes&quot; (2009–2011)===
Pet Shop Boys received the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music in 2009. A statement from Brits Committee chairman Ged Doherty said: &quot;Since their first Brit Award over 20 years ago, Neil and Chris have produced a fantastic body of work with songs that truly were the soundtrack to a whole generation&#x27;s lives. The Pet Shop Boys have since become one of the most influential groups of the modern era and are deserving recipients of the award.&quot; The duo performed a medley of their greatest hits at the ceremony, with Lady Gaga singing Dusty Springfield&#x27;s part on &quot;What Have I Done to Deserve This?&quot;

Pet Shop Boys completed their next album in late 2008. Recorded with Xenomania and released in UK on 23 March 2009, &quot;Yes&quot; received generally favorable reviews and hit number four in the UK, their highest album chart position in more than a decade. Pet Shop Boys co-wrote the Girls Aloud Top 10 track &quot;The Loving Kind&quot;. Originally written for &quot;Yes&quot;, the song was deemed unsuitable by Lowe and was given to the popular girl group to record instead for their album &quot;Out of Control&quot;. At the start of 2009, Pet Shop Boys appointed Angela Becker as their new manager.

On 4 November 2009, Pet Shop Boys celebrated the Brazilian leg of the tour by releasing a compilation titled &quot;Party&quot;, including songs that were heavily featured in popular soap operas on TV Globo: &quot;Being boring&quot; (&quot;Meu Bem Meu Mal&quot; OST), &quot;Domino dancing&quot; (&quot;O Salvador da Patria&quot; OST), &quot;West End Girls&quot; (&quot;Selva de Pedra&quot; OST) and &quot;King of Rome&quot; (&quot;Viver a Vida&quot;). On 14 December 2009, Pet Shop Boys released an EP of covers, remixes, and new material, titled &quot;Christmas&quot;. On 20 December the EP entered the UK chart at number 40.
On 15 February 2010, Pet Shop Boys released a live album/DVD double-pack called &quot;Pandemonium&quot;. It contains the soundtrack and footage recorded from their 21 December 2009 show at the O2 Arena in London. Pet Shop Boys released their version of &quot;Love Life&quot; in April 2010 as a limited edition 7-inch vinyl single available only in independent UK record stores. The song was originally recorded during the &quot;Release&quot; sessions in 2001 and was subsequently given to Swedish band Alcazar. The B-side was &quot;A Powerful Friend&quot;, a song originally composed in the early 1980s and subsequently recorded in late 2002 during the recording sessions that would contribute to the &quot;Disco 3&quot; album.

In June 2010, Pet Shop Boys headlined the Other Stage on the Saturday evening of the 40th anniversary Glastonbury Festival and were heralded as dazzling with &quot;one of the most spectacular Glastonbury moments ever.&quot;. This set included a surprise cover of Coldplay&#x27;s &quot;Viva La Vida&quot;, which Tennant thought sounded similar to a Pet Shop Boys song when he first heard it.

In November they released their third compilation album &quot;Ultimate&quot; preceded by the single &quot;Together&quot;; a limited edition featured their entire Glastonbury festival performance from that year on an additional DVD. 

Pet Shop Boys composed a ballet, &quot;The Most Incredible Thing&quot;, based on a fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen, which opened at Sadlers Wells in London on 17 March 2011. The story was adapted by Matthew Dunster and the ballet was choreographed by Javier de Frutos. It featured former Royal Ballet star Ivan Putrov, animated films created by Tal Rosner, and orchestrations by German composer Sven Helbig, who worked with the band in 2005 as a co-producer for &quot;Battleship Potemkin&quot;.

===&quot;Elysium&quot; and &quot;Electric&quot; (2011–2015)===

On 28 September 2011, Pet Shop Boys announced that they had written 16 songs in preparation for their next studio album. In the meantime, &quot;Format&quot;, an album of the duo&#x27;s B-sides from 1996 to 2009, was released on 6 February 2012 as a sequel to their earlier B-side collection &quot;Alternative&quot;. &quot;Format&quot; entered the UK charts at number 26 on 12 February 2012.

On 21 November 2011, the Beyond Theatre Award was presented to Pet Shop Boys and the director of &quot;The Most Incredible Thing&quot;, Javier de Frutos. The award was introduced and presented by the artist, film director and occasional PSB collaborator Sam Taylor-Wood.

In January 2012, Pet Shop Boys started recording their new album in Los Angeles with producer Andrew Dawson. In June, a teaser video by renowned Los Angeles artist/film-maker Brian Bress for the album track &quot;Invisible&quot; was released online, at which time &quot;Elysium&quot; was revealed to be name of the new album. The first single was &quot;Winner&quot;, preceding the release of &quot;Elysium&quot; in September. On 28 July, Pet Shop Boys performed &quot;Winner&quot;, &quot;Always On My Mind&quot; and &quot;What Have I Done to Deserve This?&quot; before the Olympic tennis games in Henman Hill, Wimbledon. At the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony on 12 August, Tennant and Lowe rode around the stadium in cycle-driven chariots, wearing pointy hats as they performed &quot;West End Girls&quot; to a global audience.

In March 2013, Pet Shop Boys announced that they were leaving their longtime record label Parlophone. Their twelfth album, entitled &quot;Electric&quot;, was released on 12 July 2013 on their own label x2 through Kobalt Label Services. The album was the biggest-selling record among the UK&#x27;s independent record shops during the week of its release, and went straight to the number one position on the Official Record Store Chart. &quot;Electric&quot; was the first of three consecutive albums produced by Stuart Price. The release coincided with the Electric Tour that included Chile, Argentina, Paraguay, Brazil, Colombia, Asia—with dates in the Philippines, Indonesia, and China for the first time—Lebanon, Israel, Turkey, Europe and North America. On 23 July, Pet Shop Boys appeared at the BBC Proms to premiere &quot;A Man from the Future&quot;, a piece written for orchestra, choir, electronics, and narrator, based on the life of Alan Turing.

===&quot;Super&quot;, &quot;Further Listening&quot;, and &quot;Agenda&quot; (2016–2019)===

On 21 January 2016, Pet Shop Boys previewed the track &quot;Inner Sanctum&quot; from their thirteenth album, &quot;Super&quot;. The lead single from the album, &quot;The Pop Kids&quot;, was released on 18 March, reaching number one on the US Dance Club Songs chart. The album debuted at number three on the UK Albums Chart, selling 16,953 copies in its first week, becoming their thirteenth consecutive top 10 studio album. In the United States, &quot;Super&quot; debuted at number 58 on the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 10,000 copies. It also debuted at number one on &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance/Electronic Albums chart, becoming Pet Shop Boys&#x27; first number one album on the chart since &quot;Disco 3&quot; (2003).

Pet Shop Boys announced their &quot;Further Listening&quot; reissues project, called &quot;Catalogue: 1985–2012&quot; in June 2017. The first batch was released that July with a remaster of &quot;Nightlife&quot;, &quot;Release&quot; and &quot;Fundamental&quot;. Reissues of &quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;Elysium&quot; were released on 20 October 2017, and the previously released &quot;Further Listening&quot; albums &quot;Please&quot;, &quot;Actually&quot;, and &quot;Introspective&quot; were remastered and re-released on 2 March 2018. The fourth and final batch of reissues—&quot;Behaviour&quot;, &quot;Very&quot; and &quot;Bilingual&quot;—was released on 31 August 2018.

The live album/DVD/Blu-ray &quot;Inner Sanctum&quot; was released in April 2019. It followed February&#x27;s EP &quot;Agenda&quot;. which contains four new songs with a political and pop culture angle. Neil Tennant said the release &quot;contains three satirical songs and one rather sad song. I think it&#x27;s because of the times we&#x27;re living through&quot;.

===&quot;Hotspot&quot;, Unity Tour, &quot;Lost EP&quot;, and &quot;Nonetheless&quot; (2020–present)===
In 2020, their fourteenth album, &quot;Hotspot&quot;, was released on x2/Kobalt. Three singles were released to promote &quot;Hotspot&quot;: &quot;Dreamland&quot; featuring Years &amp; Years, &quot;Monkey Business&quot;, and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna&quot;.

The corresponding was planned to start mid-2020, but was postponed twice due to the COVID-19 pandemic; it finally got underway in May 2022 and included their third appearance at the Glastonbury festival, this time closing the Other Stage on the Sunday night. In September and October 2022, the band co-headlined the Unity Tour with New Order, playing twelve arenas across Canada and the US. On 31 December 2022, Pet Shop Boys performed at Edinburgh&#x27;s Hogmanay celebrations with a special Dreamworld show. In 2023 they continued their Dreamworld tour, headlining the Primavera Sound festivals in Barcelona, Madrid, Porto, Santiago, Sao Paulo and Lima.

In March 2023, the duo started working on their fifteenth studio album with producer James Ford. In the interim, the EP &quot;Lost&quot;, made up of music recorded during &quot;Super&quot; sessions was released. The Dreamworld tour wrapped up in 2024, with a five-night residency at the Royal Opera House in July, followed by a gig at Funny Girls in Blackpool and a headline appearance at the final night of Radio 2 in the Park in Preston in September.

In January 2024, the album title &quot;Nonetheless&quot; and its cover art were revealed with an 26 April release date, along with the news that Pet Shop Boys would be returning to Parlophone. The music video for the lead single, &quot;Loneliness&quot;, was released on YouTube on 31 January. On 3 April the second single &quot;Dancing Star&quot; was released, inspired by Russian ballet dancer Rudolf Nureyev. The single featured a remix of a previous B-side &quot;Party in the Blitz&quot; featuring Princess Julia. The third single, &quot;A New Bohemia&quot; was released on 4 June, followed by a fourth single, &quot;Feel&quot; on 20 August. The fifth single, a double A-side of &quot;New London Boy&quot; and a cover version of &quot;All The Young Dudes&quot; by David Bowie, was released on 7 November, followed by an expanded re-release of &quot;Nonetheless&quot; on 22 November, including demo versions of all tracks plus four new bonus tracks. 

In November, Pet Shop Boys played &quot;All the Young Dudes&quot; in a medley with &quot;West End Girls&quot;, accompanied by the Manchester Camerata, at the 2024 MTV Europe Music Awards, where the duo were honoured as Pop Pioneers. They also appeared on &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; in Lowe&#x27;s hometown during Blackpool Week, playing a medley of hits for the opening dance number, followed by a performance of &quot;All the Young Dudes&quot; the next night. 

==Style and image==
In 2020, BBC journalist Nick Levine noted that Pet Shop Boys still maintain a somewhat &quot;detached and ambivalent approach&quot; to their success, which also shows in their low profile on social media. Music journalist Steve Harnell described them as having both an &quot;ear for commerciality&quot; and the desire to create &quot;something more highbrow&quot;. He also described Tennant&#x27;s lyrics as showing a &quot;love for language&quot;, which Tennant sparkles with sometimes quite-obscure cultural references. Their music in the 1980s was inspired by dance music in gay clubs but transformed into a &quot;very British and brainy brand of pop music, shot through with a streak of social comment so subtly done that people frequently missed the point entirely.&quot;

Lowe said in a 1986 &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; interview that he doesn&#x27;t &quot;like country and western. I don&#x27;t like rock music, I don&#x27;t like rockabilly or rock and roll particularly. I don&#x27;t like much, really, do I? But what I do like, I love passionately. The quote was subsequently sampled in the song &quot;Paninaro&quot;. The 1997 B-side &quot;How I Learned to Hate Rock and Roll&quot;, and their early 1990s songs &quot;DJ Culture&quot;, &quot;Can You Forgive Her?&quot; and &quot;How Can You Expect to Be Taken Seriously?&quot; continued this sentiment. They are still known for openly criticising trends in the music business, such as reality television music shows in 2010 (&quot;it&#x27;s so awful and negative and stifling, and so un-pop&quot;).

Their band dynamic has played a role in their public image. Early in their career, the duo were frequently accused of lacking stage presence, said to be a deliberate reaction to the hyper-cheerful music of the time, demonstrated by bands such as Wham!. A typical early performance featured Lowe in the background playing the bassline on a Fairlight synthesiser keyboard and Tennant singing, but otherwise passive, in the foreground. Tennant and Lowe both became well known for standing still throughout performances. In a 2016 interview, Chris Lowe said the duo&#x27;s live performances were a response to the music scene in the 1980s: &quot;Everyone was so active. It was a big party where everyone was having a great time and smiling at the camera. Thumbs aloft! We just didn&#x27;t want to do that. So we ignored the cameras and the jollity of the situations. Let&#x27;s face it, it&#x27;s easier to stand stock-still isn&#x27;t it?&quot;.

When they first began touring, in 1989, they were heavily influenced by opera and theatre staging. Derek Jarman staged their first tour, making a series of films to be projected behind the costumed singers and dancers. In 1991, they brought in David Alden and David Fielding, from the English National Opera, to create the staging and costume design, for a show which made little attempt to involve or even acknowledge the audience and pushed the choreography and staging centre-stage. Subsequent tours have used artist Sam Taylor-Wood and architect Zaha Hadid for stage design. The Fundamentalism tour in 2006–2007 was conceived and designed by theatre designer Es Devlin, with choreography by Hakeem Onibudo. Es Devlin also conceived the 2009–2010 Pandemonium Tour as well as the Electric Tour beginning in 2013.

Typically, Pet Shop Boys have favoured avant-garde tailored fashions. Tennant has referenced the designers of his suits in certain interviews and Lowe has often sported outfits and glasses made by Issey Miyake, Stüssy, and Yohji Yamamoto&#x27;s Y-3 for Adidas. Presentation has always been a major theme for Pet Shop Boys and the duo have dramatically &quot;re-invented&quot; their image twice in their career. In 1993, when promoting their &quot;Very&quot; album, they wore brightly-coloured costumes and used state-of-the-art computer technology to place themselves in a modern computer graphic world. This concept of re-invention was revisited for the promotion of their &quot;Nightlife&quot; album, in which they transformed their look, wearing wigs and glasses, with stylised futuristic urban wardrobes. In 2006, both Tennant and Lowe were seen on stage and in photographs wearing clothes designed by Hedi Slimane/Dior Homme, and in 2018 they fronted the Dior Homme SS18 campaign.

They have always been interested in the artwork, design and photography of their own releases. Photographer Eric Watson helped shape the original image of Pet Shop Boys, creating many of their photographs and videos early in their career. In design they have primarily worked with Mark Farrow, who designed the cover of their first Parlophone album release in 1986. The collaboration between Mark Farrow and Pet Shop Boys is comparable to the designer/band relationship of Peter Saville and New Order, Anton Corbijn and Depeche Mode, or the epic-length collaboration of Simon Halfon and Paul Weller. Their record sleeves are quite often very minimal and the attention to detail is obvious. In October 2006, British art publisher Thames &amp; Hudson published a 336-page hardcover book titled &quot;Pet Shop Boys Catalogue&quot;, by Chris Heath and Philip Hoare, showcasing the group&#x27;s accomplishments in artwork, design and music. A German-language edition was also published. An exhibition of photographs of Pet Shop Boys was organised at the National Portrait Gallery in London to coincide with the publication.

Even the band&#x27;s fan base has been subject to commentary. In 2001, music theorist Fred Everett Maus wrote that, contrary to the ideologies of anti-commercialism and authenticity embodied by &quot;serious&quot; discussions of popular music such as rock, Pet Shop Boys fans exhibit &quot;an undisguised love of commercial success&quot;. This was demonstrated through mailing list discussions from 1998 onwards, in which fans voiced concern over the &quot;most commercially promising selection and marketing of singles&quot; for the then-upcoming &quot;Nightlife&quot;, and debated the quality of the then-recent &quot;Bilingual&quot;, spurred by the album&#x27;s poorer performance in sales. Most posters, Maus summarised, feared that the band&#x27;s appeal would become essentially limited to a cult following; &quot;dissent, along the lines that the fans would always have the Pet Shop Boys, no matter what happened commercially, was scarce and ineffectual&quot;. Noting the fact that Pet Shop Boys &quot;began their career with hits&quot;, Maus made the point that this early success was valued by fans: the band&#x27;s &quot;large audiences&quot; were just as important to &quot;many fans&quot; as the making of &quot;distinctive music that individual fans loved&quot;.

Pet Shop Boys have been noted for keeping their fingers on the musical pulse to date, while &quot;maintaining the mystique of performers from a different era&quot;. Lynn Barber, writing for the London Observer on 1 July 1997 stated that &quot;The genius of the Pet Shop Boys was to combine these polar opposites: Neil&#x27;s wistful introspective lyrics and Chris&#x27;s mindless, cheerful, upbeat rhythms. They would never have been in the Top 10 without Chris; they would never have engaged an intelligent audience without Neil.&quot;

==Influence==
As of 2003, Pet Shop Boys were ranked by &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Joel Whitburn (in his book &quot;Billboard&#x27;s Hot Dance/Disco 1974–2003&quot;) as the fourth most successful act on the U.S. Dance/Club Play charts, behind only Madonna, Michael Jackson and Donna Summer.

The history between Madonna and Pet Shop Boys goes back to 1988, with the song &quot;Heart&quot;. In the liner notes to their 1991 greatest hits album, &quot;&quot;, the band states that: &quot;When we wrote this song (&quot;Heart&quot;) we wanted to submit it to Madonna but didn&#x27;t dare risk disappointment.&quot; Pet Shop Boys kept the song for themselves and it ended up going to number one in the UK. Later, in 1991, Madonna was referenced in a tongue-in-cheek lyric, in the song &quot;DJ Culture&quot;, soon after she and Sean Penn had divorced. Tennant writes: &quot;Like Liz before Betty / She after Sean / Suddenly you&#x27;re missing / Then you&#x27;re reborn&quot;. Madonna&#x27;s album &quot;Confessions on a Dance Floor&quot;, released November 2005, includes a track called &quot;Jump&quot;, which has close similarities to &quot;West End Girls&quot;. An interview at Popjustice with Stuart Price, who produced Madonna&#x27;s album, revealed that the track was a complete Chris Lowe inspiration. Pet Shop Boys then remixed &quot;Sorry&quot;, the second single from the album. Madonna has used their version in her 2006 &quot;Confessions&quot; tour. Lady Gaga stated that she listened regularly to Pet Shop Boys while working on her debut album &quot;The Fame&quot;, and that they were an influence on her music.

In October 2005, a Swedish tribute band called West End Girls had a number three hit single in their home country, with a cover version of &quot;Domino Dancing&quot;. In January 2006, they released their own version of &quot;West End Girls&quot; and an album was also released in June. In August 2014, Pet Shop Boys appeared in the BBC Radio 4 series &quot;The Archers&quot; as last-minute headliners at the fictional festival Loxfest. Both Tennant and Lowe had speaking roles in the show.

==Sexuality==
Neil Tennant, who neither denied nor confirmed gay rumours throughout the 1980s, came out in a 1994 interview for &quot;Attitude&quot;, a UK gay lifestyle magazine. Tennant has said that he does not want to be defined by his sexuality or be labeled as a &#x27;gay pop star&#x27; out of concern that it would dominate coverage of the Pet Shop Boys.

Many of Tennant&#x27;s lyrics are written using gender-neutral language, as a way to be inclusive. He has also written songs in character from the perspective of women and heterosexual men, and, as he stated in the &quot;Attitude&quot; interview, he has written songs from his own perspective as a gay man. In 2024, Tennant described the Pet Shop Boys album &quot;Nonetheless&quot; as &quot;our queer album&quot;, with songs like &quot;Love Is the Law&quot;, referencing Oscar Wilde, and &quot;New London Boy&quot;, recalling his own experiences in London in the early 1970s.

Several Pet Shop Boys songs deal with the AIDS crisis of the 1980s and early 1990s, which they lived through. Tennant wrote a trio of songs about his best friend from Newcastle, Christopher Dowell, who died from the disease in 1989: &quot;It Couldn&#x27;t Happen Here&quot; alludes to their early complacency, &quot;Being Boring&quot; is an elegy to their friendship, and &quot;Your Funny Uncle&quot; describes his funeral.

<text>Harlingen ( ) is a city in Cameron County in the central region of the Rio Grande Valley of the southern part of the U.S. state of Texas, about from the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. The city covers more than and is the second-largest city in Cameron County, as well as the fourth-largest in the Rio Grande Valley. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 71,892.

Harlingen is a principal city of the Brownsville–Harlingen metropolitan area, which is part of the larger Brownsville–Harlingen–Raymondville combined statistical area, included in the Matamoros–Brownsville metropolitan region.

==History==

Harlingen&#x27;s strategic location at the intersection of U.S. Route 77 and U.S. Route 83, codesignated as Interstate 69 East and Interstate 2, respectively, in northwestern Cameron County, fostered its development as a distribution, shipping, and industrial center. In 1904, Lon C. Hill (a man of Choctaw ancestry) envisioned the Rio Grande as a commercial waterway. He named the town he founded on the north bank after the Frisian city of Harlingen, in the Netherlands. The town&#x27;s post office was established that year. The first school opened with 15 pupils in 1905 near the Hill home, the first residence built in Harlingen. Harlingen incorporated on April 15, 1910, when the population totaled 1,126. In 1920, the census listed 1,748. The local economy at first was almost entirely agricultural, with the chief crops vegetables and cotton.

World War II military installations in Harlingen caused a jump in population from 23,000 in 1950 to 41,000 by 1960. Harlingen Army Air Field preceded Harlingen Air Force Base, which closed in 1962. The city&#x27;s population fell to 33,603 by 1972, then climbed to 40,824 by 1980. Local enterprise, focused on the purchase and use of the abandoned base and related housing, laid the groundwork for continuing progress through a diversified economy. The estimated population in July 1985 was 49,000, of which about 80% was Hispanic. In the late 1980s, income from tourism ranked second only to citrus fruit production, with grain and cotton next in order. The addition of wholesale and retail trade, light and medium manufacturing, and an array of service industries has broadened the economic base. Large-scale construction for multifaceted retirement communities is a new phase of industrial development.

The City of Harlingen operates a busy industrial airpark where bombers used to land. At Valley International Airport, the Confederate Air Force (now Commemorative Air Force) occupied hangar and apron space until 1991. The first hospital in Harlingen opened in 1923, and consisted of little more than two barracks as wings. The Valley Baptist Hospital was built nearby a few years later, and eventually the older hospital closed. The Valley Baptist Hospital has grown into the Valley Baptist Medical Center. The city&#x27;s outstanding network of health-care specialists and facilities parallels the growth of the still-expanding center. Also serving regional health needs are the South Texas State Chest Hospital, the State Hospital for Children, and the Rio Grande State Mental Health and Mental Retardation Center.

Besides public and church-affiliated schools, Harlingen students attend the University Preparatory School, the Marine Military Academy, Texas State Technical College, or Rio Grande Vocational and Rehabilitation classes. Civic and cultural development in Harlingen has kept pace with the growth of the community. Fraternal orders and civic organizations operating in the community include Rotary, Kiwanis, Lions, Optimist, 20–30, VFW, American Legion, and the Lower Valley Cotillion Club; a woman&#x27;s building is maintained as a center for the activities of the many woman&#x27;s clubs active in the city. Development and appreciation of the fine arts are encouraged by organizations such as the Rio Grande Valley Art League, the Art Forum, and the Rio Grande Valley Civic Association, which stages its winter concert series at the 2,300-seat Harlingen Municipal Auditorium. Each March, Harlingen is the site of the Rio Grande Valley International Music Festival. The city has two newspapers—the &quot;Harlingen Press&quot;, a weekly paper established in 1951, and the &quot;Valley Morning Star&quot;, a daily established in 1911. In 1990, the population was 48,735. In 1992, the city was named an All-America City, cited especially for its volunteer spirit and self-help programs. In 2000, the community had 57,564 inhabitants and 2,549 businesses.

Additional airlines that serve the airport include United Express to Houston Intercontinental, American Airlines with daily nonstop service to Dallas DFW, Frontier Airlines with weekly nonstop service to Chicago and Denver, and Delta Air Lines and Sun Country Airlines with seasonal, nonstop service to Minneapolis-St. Paul.

===Public transit===
The city is working to build a public transit center as a hub for bus lines to Harlingen. The project is currently on hold due to funding issues.

===Highways===
The city of Harlingen is at the junction of U.S. Route 77 and U.S. Route 83, designated as Interstate 69E and Interstate 2, respectively. Interstate 69E runs through north–south through Harlingen, while the city serves as the eastern terminus of Interstate 2. U.S. Route 77 connects the Rio Grande Valley to Interstate 37 at Corpus Christi. U.S. Route 83 connects the Rio Grande Valley with Interstate 35 at Laredo.

===International trade bridges===
The Free Trade Bridge at Los Indios is a state-of-the-art international bridge located just south of Harlingen. With a full U.S. Customs inspection facility that accommodates up to 75 trucks simultaneously, the Free Trade Bridge is acclaimed as the most time-efficient border crossing in the valley. The bridge accesses a four-lane highway in northern Mexico, offering a fast route to the border cities of Matamoros and Reynosa, as well as the industrial city of Monterrey. With the completion of Mexico&#x27;s State of Tamaulipas new &#x27;autopista&#x27;, the Free Trade Bridge will provide a seamless highway connection for more efficient distribution of industrial products to and from interior Mexico.

===Ports===
The Port of Harlingen is located east of Harlingen on Highway 106. It is west of mile marker 646 on the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, which stretches from the Mexican border at Brownsville, along the entire coast of the Gulf of Mexico to St. Marks, Florida. The Gulf Intracoastal Waterway provides over of protected waterway, deep and wide. The Harlingen Channel is maintained to a width of and a depth of and is supplied by the Arroyo Colorado, a freshwater river.

===Railroads===
Union Pacific Railroad has a local terminal and switching yard in Harlingen. The Harlingen Industrial Parks and Port of Harlingen have direct rail access. Harlingen has a rich history as a railroad town. The Southern Pacific depot has been razed, but it was one of four SP depots in the Rio Grande Valley (the others are Brownsville, now a museum; McAllen, now a law office; and Edinburg, now the home of the Chamber of Commerce).

Harlingen was served by the Missouri Pacific Railroad night train on a Houston, Texas-Brownsville, Texas route, the &quot;Pioneer&quot; (#315/316) until 1964 and day train on that route, the &quot;Valley Eagle&quot; (#321/322) until 1962.

<doc id="51653" wikidata="Q1010269" url="?curid=51653" title="Burali-Forti paradox">
<text>In set theory, a field of mathematics, the Burali-Forti paradox demonstrates that constructing &quot;the set of all ordinal numbers&quot; leads to a contradiction and therefore shows an antinomy in a system that allows its construction. It is named after Cesare Burali-Forti, who, in 1897, published a paper proving a theorem which, unknown to him, contradicted a previously proved result by Georg Cantor. Bertrand Russell subsequently noticed the contradiction, and when he published it in his 1903 book &quot;Principles of Mathematics&quot;, he stated that it had been suggested to him by Burali-Forti&#x27;s paper, with the result that it came to be known by Burali-Forti&#x27;s name.

==Stated in terms of von Neumann ordinals==

We will prove this by contradiction.

# Let be a set consisting of all ordinal numbers.
# is transitive because for every element of (which is an ordinal number and can be any ordinal number) and every element of (i.e. under the definition of Von Neumann ordinals, for every ordinal number ), we have that is an element of because any ordinal number contains only ordinal numbers, by the definition of this ordinal construction.
# is well ordered by the membership relation because all its elements are also well ordered by this relation.
# So, by steps 2 and 3, we have that is an ordinal class and also, by step 1, an ordinal number, because all ordinal classes that are sets are also ordinal numbers.
# This implies that is an element of .
# Under the definition of Von Neumann ordinals, is the same as being an element of . This latter statement is proven by step 5.
# But no ordinal class is less than itself, including because of step 4 ( is an ordinal class), i.e. .

We have deduced two contradictory propositions ( and ) from the sethood of and, therefore, disproved that is a set.

==Stated more generally==

The version of the paradox above is anachronistic, because it presupposes the definition of the ordinals due to John von Neumann, under which each ordinal is the set of all preceding ordinals, which was not known at the time the paradox was framed by Burali-Forti.
Here is an account with fewer presuppositions: suppose that we associate with each well-ordering
an object called its order type in an unspecified way (the order types are the ordinal numbers). The order types (ordinal numbers) themselves are well-ordered in a natural way,
and this well-ordering must have an order type formula_1. It is easily shown in
naïve set theory (and remains true in ZFC but not in New Foundations) that the order
type of all ordinal numbers less than a fixed formula_2 is formula_2 itself.
So the order
type of all ordinal numbers less than formula_1 is formula_1 itself. But
this means that formula_1, being the order type of a proper initial segment of the ordinals, is strictly less than the order type of all the ordinals,
but the latter is formula_1 itself by definition. This is a contradiction.

If we use the von Neumann definition, under which each ordinal is identified as the set of all preceding ordinals, the paradox is unavoidable: the offending proposition that the order type of all ordinal numbers less than a fixed formula_2 is formula_2 itself must be true. The collection of von Neumann ordinals, like the collection in the Russell paradox, cannot be a set in any set theory with classical logic. But the collection of order types in New Foundations (defined as equivalence classes of well-orderings under similarity) is actually a set, and the paradox is avoided because the order type of the ordinals less than formula_1
turns out not to be formula_1.

==Resolutions of the paradox==

Modern axioms for formal set theory such as ZF and ZFC circumvent this antinomy by not allowing the construction of sets using terms like &quot;all sets with the property formula_12&quot;, as is possible in naive set theory and as is possible with Gottlob Frege&#x27;s axiomsspecifically Basic Law Vin the &quot;Grundgesetze der Arithmetik.&quot; Quine&#x27;s system New Foundations (NF) uses a different solution. showed that in the original version of Quine&#x27;s system &quot;Mathematical Logic&quot; (ML), an extension of New Foundations, it is possible to derive the Burali-Forti paradox, showing that this system was contradictory. Quine&#x27;s revision of ML following Rosser&#x27;s discovery does not suffer from this defect, and indeed was subsequently proved equiconsistent with NF by Hao Wang.

<doc id="51654" wikidata="Q464949" url="?curid=51654" title="Soliton">
<text>In mathematics and physics, a soliton is a nonlinear, self-reinforcing, localized wave packet that is , in that it preserves its shape while propagating freely, at constant velocity, and recovers it even after collisions with other such localized wave packets. Its remarkable stability can be traced to a balanced cancellation of nonlinear and dispersive effects in the medium. Solitons were subsequently found to provide stable solutions of a wide class of weakly nonlinear dispersive partial differential equations describing physical systems.

The soliton phenomenon was first described in 1834 by John Scott Russell who observed a solitary wave in the Union Canal in Scotland. He reproduced the phenomenon in a wave tank and named it the &quot;Wave of Translation&quot;. The Korteweg–de Vries equation was later formulated to model such waves, and the term &quot;soliton&quot; was coined by Zabusky and Kruskal to describe localized, strongly stable propagating solutions to this equation. The name was meant to characterize the solitary nature of the waves, with the &quot;on&quot; suffix recalling the usage for particles such as electrons, baryons or hadrons, reflecting their observed particle-like behaviour.

==Definition==
A single, consensus definition of a soliton is difficult to find. ascribe three properties to solitons:
# They are of permanent form;
# They are localized within a region;
# They can interact with other solitons, and emerge from the collision unchanged, except for a phase shift.

More formal definitions exist, but they require substantial mathematics. Moreover, some scientists use the term &quot;soliton&quot; for phenomena that do not quite have these three properties (for instance, the &#x27;light bullets&#x27; of nonlinear optics are often called solitons despite losing energy during interaction).

==Explanation==

Dispersion and nonlinearity can interact to produce permanent and localized wave forms. Consider a pulse of light traveling in glass. This pulse can be thought of as consisting of light of several different frequencies. Since glass shows dispersion, these different frequencies travel at different speeds and the shape of the pulse therefore changes over time. However, also the nonlinear Kerr effect occurs; the refractive index of a material at a given frequency depends on the light&#x27;s amplitude or strength. If the pulse has just the right shape, the Kerr effect exactly cancels the dispersion effect and the pulse&#x27;s shape does not change over time. Thus, the pulse is a soliton. See soliton (optics) for a more detailed description.

Many exactly solvable models have soliton solutions, including the Korteweg–de Vries equation, the nonlinear Schrödinger equation, the coupled nonlinear Schrödinger equation, and the sine-Gordon equation. The soliton solutions are typically obtained by means of the inverse scattering transform, and owe their stability to the integrability of the field equations. The mathematical theory of these equations is a broad and very active field of mathematical research.

Some types of tidal bore, a wave phenomenon of a few rivers including the River Severn, are &#x27;undular&#x27;: a wavefront followed by a train of solitons. Other solitons occur as the undersea internal waves, initiated by seabed topography, that propagate on the oceanic pycnocline. Atmospheric solitons also exist, such as the morning glory cloud of the Gulf of Carpentaria, where pressure solitons traveling in a temperature inversion layer produce vast linear roll clouds. The recent and not widely accepted soliton model in neuroscience proposes to explain the signal conduction within neurons as pressure solitons.

A topological soliton, also called a topological defect, is any solution of a set of partial differential equations that is stable against decay to the &quot;trivial solution&quot;. Soliton stability is due to topological constraints, rather than integrability of the field equations. The constraints arise almost always because the differential equations must obey a set of boundary conditions, and the boundary has a nontrivial homotopy group, preserved by the differential equations. Thus, the differential equation solutions can be classified into homotopy classes.

No continuous transformation maps a solution in one homotopy class to another. The solutions are truly distinct, and maintain their integrity, even in the face of extremely powerful forces. Examples of topological solitons include the screw dislocation in a crystalline lattice, the Dirac string and the magnetic monopole in electromagnetism, the Skyrmion and the Wess–Zumino–Witten model in quantum field theory, the magnetic skyrmion in condensed matter physics, and cosmic strings and domain walls in cosmology.

==History==

In 1834, John Scott Russell described his &quot;wave of translation&quot;:

Scott Russell spent some time making practical and theoretical investigations of these waves. He built wave tanks at his home and noticed some key properties:
* The waves are stable, and can travel over very large distances (normal waves would tend to either flatten out, or steepen and topple over)
* The speed depends on the size of the wave, and its width on the depth of water.
* Unlike normal waves they will never merge – so a small wave is overtaken by a large one, rather than the two combining.
* If a wave is too big for the depth of water, it splits into two, one big and one small.

Scott Russell&#x27;s experimental work seemed at odds with Isaac Newton&#x27;s and Daniel Bernoulli&#x27;s theories of hydrodynamics. George Biddell Airy and George Gabriel Stokes had difficulty accepting Scott Russell&#x27;s experimental observations because they could not be explained by the existing water wave theories. Additional observations were reported by Henry Bazin in 1862 after experiments carried out in the canal de Bourgogne in France. Their contemporaries spent some time attempting to extend the theory but it would take until the 1870s before Joseph Boussinesq and Lord Rayleigh published a theoretical treatment and solutions. In 1895 Diederik Korteweg and Gustav de Vries provided what is now known as the Korteweg–de Vries equation, including solitary wave and periodic cnoidal wave solutions.
In 1965 Norman Zabusky of Bell Labs and Martin Kruskal of Princeton University first demonstrated soliton behavior in media subject to the Korteweg–de Vries equation (KdV equation) in a computational investigation using a finite difference approach. They also showed how this behavior explained the puzzling earlier work of Fermi, Pasta, Ulam, and Tsingou.

In 1967, Gardner, Greene, Kruskal and Miura discovered an inverse scattering transform enabling analytical solution of the KdV equation. The work of Peter Lax on Lax pairs and the Lax equation has since extended this to solution of many related soliton-generating systems.

Solitons are, by definition, unaltered in shape and speed by a collision with other solitons. So solitary waves on a water surface are &quot;near&quot;-solitons, but not exactly – after the interaction of two (colliding or overtaking) solitary waves, they have changed a bit in amplitude and an oscillatory residual is left behind.

Solitons are also studied in quantum mechanics, thanks to the fact that they could provide a new foundation of it through de Broglie&#x27;s unfinished program, known as &quot;Double solution theory&quot; or &quot;Nonlinear wave mechanics&quot;. This theory, developed by de Broglie in 1927 and revived in the 1950s, is the natural continuation of his ideas developed between 1923 and 1926, which extended the wave–particle duality introduced by Albert Einstein for the light quanta, to all the particles of matter. The observation of accelerating surface gravity water wave soliton using an external hydrodynamic linear potential was demonstrated in 2019. This experiment also demonstrated the ability to excite and measure the phases of ballistic solitons.

==In fiber optics==

Much experimentation has been done using solitons in fiber optics applications. Solitons in a fiber optic system are described by the Manakov equations.
Solitons&#x27; inherent stability make long-distance transmission possible without the use of repeaters, and could potentially double transmission capacity as well.

==In biology==
Solitons may occur in proteins and DNA. Solitons are related to the low-frequency collective motion in proteins and DNA.

A recently developed model in neuroscience proposes that signals, in the form of density waves, are conducted within neurons in the form of solitons. Solitons can be described as almost lossless energy transfer in biomolecular chains or lattices as wave-like propagations of coupled conformational and electronic disturbances.

== In material physics ==
Solitons can occur in materials, such as ferroelectrics, in the form of domain walls. Ferroelectric materials exhibit spontaneous polarization, or electric dipoles, which are coupled to configurations of the material structure. Domains of oppositely poled polarizations can be present within a single material as the structural configurations corresponding to opposing polarizations are equally favorable with no presence of external forces. The domain boundaries, or “walls”, that separate these local structural configurations are regions of lattice dislocations. The domain walls can propagate as the polarizations, and thus, the local structural configurations can switch within a domain with applied forces such as electric bias or mechanical stress. Consequently, the domain walls can be described as solitons, discrete regions of dislocations that are able to slip or propagate and maintain their shape in width and length.  

In recent literature, ferroelectricity has been observed in twisted bilayers of van der Waal materials such as molybdenum disulfide and graphene. The moiré superlattice that arises from the relative twist angle between the van der Waal monolayers generates regions of different stacking orders of the atoms within the layers. These regions exhibit inversion symmetry breaking structural configurations that enable ferroelectricity at the interface of these monolayers. The domain walls that separate these regions are composed of partial dislocations where different types of stresses, and thus, strains are experienced by the lattice. It has been observed that soliton or domain wall propagation across a moderate length of the sample (order of nanometers to micrometers) can be initiated with applied stress from an AFM tip on a fixed region. The soliton propagation carries the mechanical perturbation with little loss in energy across the material, which enables domain switching in a domino-like fashion.

It has also been observed that the type of dislocations found at the walls can affect propagation parameters such as direction. For instance, STM measurements showed four types of strains of varying degrees of shear, compression, and tension at domain walls depending on the type of localized stacking order in twisted bilayer graphene. Different slip directions of the walls are achieved with different types of strains found at the domains, influencing the direction of the soliton network propagation.

Nonidealities such as disruptions to the soliton network and surface impurities can influence soliton propagation as well. Domain walls can meet at nodes and get effectively pinned, forming triangular domains, which have been readily observed in various ferroelectric twisted bilayer systems. In addition, closed loops of domain walls enclosing multiple polarization domains can inhibit soliton propagation and thus, switching of polarizations across it. Also, domain walls can propagate and meet at wrinkles and surface inhomogeneities within the van der Waal layers, which can act as obstacles obstructing the propagation.

== In magnets ==
In magnets, there also exist different types of solitons and other nonlinear waves. These magnetic solitons are an exact solution of classical nonlinear differential equations — magnetic equations, e.g. the Landau–Lifshitz equation, continuum Heisenberg model, Ishimori equation, nonlinear Schrödinger equation and others.

==In nuclear physics==
Atomic nuclei may exhibit solitonic behavior. Here the whole nuclear wave function is predicted to exist as a soliton under certain conditions of temperature and energy. Such conditions are suggested to exist in the cores of some stars in which the nuclei would not react but pass through each other unchanged, retaining their soliton waves through a collision between nuclei.

The Skyrme Model is a model of nuclei in which each nucleus is considered to be a topologically stable soliton solution of a field theory with conserved baryon number.

==Bions==

The bound state of two solitons is known as a &quot;bion&quot;, or in systems where the bound state periodically oscillates, a &quot;breather&quot;. The interference-type forces between solitons could be used in making bions. However, these forces are very sensitive to their relative phases. Alternatively, the bound state of solitons could be formed by dressing atoms with highly excited Rydberg levels. The resulting self-generated potential profile features an inner attractive soft-core supporting the 3D self-trapped soliton, an intermediate repulsive shell (barrier) preventing solitons’ fusion, and an outer attractive layer (well) used for completing the bound state resulting in giant stable soliton molecules. In this scheme, the distance and size of the individual solitons in the molecule can be controlled dynamically with the laser adjustment.

In field theory &quot;bion&quot; usually refers to the solution of the Born–Infeld model. The name appears to have been coined by G. W. Gibbons in order to distinguish this solution from the conventional soliton, understood as a &quot;regular&quot;, finite-energy (and usually stable) solution of a differential equation describing some physical system. The word &quot;regular&quot; means a smooth solution carrying no sources at all. However, the solution of the Born–Infeld model still carries a source in the form of a Dirac-delta function at the origin. As a consequence it displays a singularity in this point (although the electric field is everywhere regular). In some physical contexts (for instance string theory) this feature can be important, which motivated the introduction of a special name for this class of solitons.

On the other hand, when gravity is added (i.e. when considering the coupling of the Born–Infeld model to general relativity) the corresponding solution is called &quot;EBIon&quot;, where &quot;E&quot; stands for Einstein.

==Alcubierre drive==
Erik Lentz, a physicist at the University of Göttingen, has theorized that solitons could allow for the generation of Alcubierre warp bubbles in spacetime without the need for exotic matter, i.e., matter with negative mass.

<text>The Severn bore is a tidal bore seen on the tidal reaches of the River Severn in south western England. It is formed when the rising tide moves into the funnel-shaped Bristol Channel and Severn Estuary and the surging water forces its way upstream in a series of waves, as far as Gloucester and beyond. The bore behaves differently in different stretches of the river; in the lower, wider parts it is more noticeable in the deep channels as a slight roller, while the water creeps across the sand and mudflats. In the narrower, upper reaches, the river occupies the whole area between its banks and the bore advances in a series of waves that move upstream. Near Gloucester, the advancing water overcomes two weirs, and sometimes one in Tewkesbury, before finally petering out.

Bores are present on about 130 days in the year, concentrated on the days immediately following the new and full moon. The size and precise timing of the bore depend on such things as the time of high tide, the barometric pressure, the wind speed and direction, the amount of water coming down the river and how well scoured the main drainage channels are. There are a number of viewpoints from which the bore can be seen, or viewers can walk along the river bank or floodbanks. Historically, the bore has been of importance to shipping visiting the docks at Gloucester, but this was alleviated by the construction of an alternative route, the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal, which opened in 1827. Nowadays the bore is of interest to surfers and canoeists who attempt to ride the waves.

== Formation ==
The Severn Estuary, which empties into the Bristol Channel, has one of the largest tidal ranges in the world – about . It is exceeded only by the Bay of Fundy, and possibly Ungava Bay, both in Canada.

The tidal wave starts far out in mid-ocean. It moves towards the continent of Europe at about 700 miles (1100 km) wide. When it reaches the continental shelf, its width decreases to about 200 miles (320 km) wide, and its amplitude increases. Approaching the Bristol Channel, a segment of the wave has to accommodate to the ever-decreasing width by raising its height. When it reaches the Severn proper, its width has decreased from or so to less than , and its height is nearly . As the bed of the estuary starts to rise and the sides continue to converge, the bore forms and begins to surge up the river in a tidal stream. The front edge of the wave is steep and the trailing edge flatter. The bore consists of three or four sizeable waves followed by a few of diminishing size. As with other waves, the wave tends to break in shallow places and near the bank, and flow smoothly in deep water. The wave travels upstream against the river current at a speed of .

In the lower, broader part of the estuary near Avonmouth, the tidal surge advances as a slight roll in the deepwater channels and the water rapidly spreads across the sands and mudbanks. Often, the Severn Bore floods the lower village of Pill if flood defences are not closed. Past Sharpness, the bore begins to form and when it encounters the large left-handed bend at Hock Cliff, it crashes headlong into the rocks. Reforming, it runs up-river close to the Overton shore before crossing the estuary towards Box Cliff. As it rounds the Horseshoe Bend it keeps to the outside but it afterwards moves across to the eastern side of the river. Above Longney Sands, the river abruptly narrows to a hundred yards, the sands diminish and the channel occupies the whole of the river. Now the bore is recognisably the spectacular phenomenon that people expect rather than a swelling flood of water. From Minsterworth to Gloucester, the width of the river varies little and the bore continues unhindered, climbing the banks on the outer side of bends and breaking over shallow places. At Lower Parting, close to Gloucester, it splits in two to pass either side of Alney Island. Both branches encounter and overcome weirs and rejoin at Upper Parting, and the much diminished bore continues upstream. In particularly high tides the water may overtop the weir at Tewkesbury, and even the foot of the weir at Worcester may experience a rise in water level of a foot (30 cm) or so.

==Timing==
The largest bores occur around the times of the equinoxes but smaller ones can be seen throughout the year. There are about 260 bores in each year occurring twice a day on 130 days. Because the bores are associated with the phases of the moon, one occurs between 7 a.m. and noon on bore days, and the other between 7 p.m. and midnight GMT, with the largest bores occurring between 9 and 11 in both the morning and evening. Maximum bores occur between one and three days after new and full moons, and smaller ones on the days that precede and follow the maxima.

Timetables for the bore and predictions of bore heights are published each year; however, the heights and timings are subject to minor variations. The bore height is increased by a strong southwest or west wind, low barometric pressure, about of fresh water below Gloucester and well-scoured channels in the estuary. The height is decreased by strong winds from the east or north, high barometric pressure and little fresh water below Gloucester or excessive fresh water. The bore is made earlier by strong southwest or west wind, low barometric pressure, between two and five feet of fresh water, and shorter and well-scoured channels in the estuary. Conversely, it is delayed by strong winds from the east or north, high barometric pressure, little fresh water and more meandering, poorly scoured channels. The wind direction out at sea is of more significance than the local air-flow.

Being the onset of the flood tide, the bore is accompanied by a rapid rise in water level which continues for about one and a half hours after the bore has passed. The Severn bore is not a self-reinforcing solitary wave or soliton but rather a shock wave which is formed because the wave is travelling faster than the wave speed in water above the bore (see tidal bore for more details). The passing of the bore causes a churning of the water, and the myriads of tiny bubbles popping contributes much of the roaring sound made by the bore. The largest recorded bore was on 15 October 1966, when it reached a height of at Stonebench.

== Viewpoints ==
There are a number of viewpoints from which the bore can be seen; viewers do not have to restrict themselves to these because most of the river banks and floodbanks are public footpaths. Crowds often assemble at popular viewing points and car parking may prove difficult. Related to the time of the high tide at Sharpness, the bore passes Newnham on Severn one hour before this, Framilode and Arlingham, twenty-five minutes before, Epney twenty minutes before, Minsterworth at the high tide, Stonebench, on the east bank, fifteen minutes after the high tide and Over Bridge thirty-five minutes afterwards.

One of the main viewpoints is at Minsterworth at the Severn Bore Inn on the A48. Another good place to see the spectacle is Over Bridge, but the view here is rather restricted by the adjacent railway bridge.

== Transport and surfing ==
The River Severn is considered a navigable river and Gloucester used to be an important port, with shipping having to deal with the bore. Vessels can ride the tide up from Sharpness to Gloucester. The tide will outstrip the vessel but by timing the journey correctly, a barge can reach Gloucester at high water. Descending is more difficult, and barges often needed to start their descent with one tide, lay up before crossing Longney Sands, and finish the descent at the next tide. These inconveniences in accessing Gloucester were overcome when the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal was opened in 1827, bypassing the need for shipping to use the river to reach Gloucester.
River surfing enthusiasts attempt to surf along on the wave, which can be high. The river was first surfed in 1955 by World War II veteran Jack Churchill, a Military Cross recipient renowned both for carrying a Scottish broadsword, and for being the only Allied soldier to kill an enemy with a longbow during the war. He became a surfing enthusiast in his later life and rode the bore on a board he designed himself.

In September 2005, several hundred surfers gathered in Newnham on Severn to celebrate 50 years since the first recorded attempt at surfing the Severn bore and to view the première of &quot;Longwave&quot; by Donny Wright, a historical film documenting the evolution of the sport since its inception in 1955. In March 2006, Steve King, a railway engineer from Gloucestershire, set a world record for the longest surfing ride on a river bore while riding the Severn bore; King surfed up the river for a distance of , a Guinness World Record.

On days when a large bore is expected, hundreds of surfing enthusiasts may accumulate, waiting for the waves to arrive. Hazards in high water conditions can include floating trees, collapsing portions of river bank, overhanging branches and even dead farm animals. The Gloucester Harbour Trustees, as competent harbour authority for this part of the river, have issued safety guidance for surfers, canoeists, small craft and river bank users in relation to the bore.
==Historical accounts==
An eighteenth century account of the bore that has been attributed to Charles Blagden (died 1820), secretary of the Royal Society, is in the collection of the Gloucestershire Archives under reference Glos. R.O., D 1914. In the account, the author described it rising to eight feet and how he rode on horseback between bends in the river in order to &quot;overtake&quot; the bore as observers still attempt to do. The phenomenon is referred to as a &quot;head of tide&quot; with the author noting at the end that elsewhere such things are known as a &quot;boar&quot; or &quot;bore&quot;.

<text>In botany, a plant shoot consists of any plant stem together with its appendages like leaves, lateral buds, flowering stems, and flower buds. The new growth from seed germination that grows upward is a shoot where leaves will develop. In the spring, perennial plant shoots are the new growth that grows from the ground in herbaceous plants or the new stem or flower growth that grows on woody plants.

In everyday speech, shoots are often synonymous with stems. Stems, which are an integral component of shoots, provide an axis for buds, fruits, and leaves.

Young shoots are often eaten by animals because the fibers in the new growth have not yet completed secondary cell wall development, making the young shoots softer and easier to chew and digest.
As shoots grow and age, the cells develop secondary cell walls that have a hard and tough structure.
Some plants (e.g. bracken) produce toxins that make their shoots inedible or less palatable.

==Shoot types of woody plants==

Many woody plants have distinct short shoots and long shoots. In some angiosperms, the short shoots, also called spur shoots or fruit spurs, produce the majority of flowers and fruit. A similar pattern occurs in some conifers and in &quot;Ginkgo&quot;, although the &quot;short shoots&quot; of some genera such as &quot;Picea&quot; are so small that they can be mistaken for part of the leaf that they have produced.

A related phenomenon is seasonal heterophylly, which involves visibly different leaves from spring growth and later lammas growth. Whereas spring growth mostly comes from buds formed the previous season, and often includes flowers, lammas growth often involves long shoots.

<doc id="51669" wikidata="Q717920" url="?curid=51669" title="Aryan Nations">
<text>Aryan Nations is a North American antisemitic, neo-Nazi and white supremacist hate group that was originally based in Kootenai County, Idaho, about miles (4.4 km) north of the city of Hayden Lake. Richard Girnt Butler founded Aryan Nations in the 1970s.

In 2001, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) classified Aryan Nations as a &quot;terrorist threat.&quot; In a review of terrorist organizations, the RAND Corporation called it the &quot;first truly nationwide terrorist network&quot; in the United States and Canada.

==History==

Aryan Nations beliefs are based on the teachings of Wesley A. Swift, a leading figure in the early Christian Identity movement. Swift was originally exposed to British Israelism while at the Angelus Temple through the teachings of visiting minister Gerald Burton Winrod. Swift was also exposed to Charles Parham&#x27;s British Israel teachings at the Angelus Temple. Combining British Israelism, extreme antisemitism, and political militancy, Swift later founded his own church in California in the mid-1940s known as the Anglo-Saxon Christian Congregation. He hosted a daily radio broadcast in California during the 1950s and 1960s. In 1957, the name of his church was changed to the Church of Jesus Christ–Christian, a name which continues to be used by Aryan Nations churches.

William Potter Gale introduced Richard Girnt Butler to Swift in 1962. Swift quickly converted Butler, who was an admirer of Adolf Hitler and Wisconsin Senator Joseph McCarthy, to Christian Identity. When Swift died in 1971, Butler fought against Gale, James Warner, and Swift&#x27;s widow for control of the Church of Jesus Christ–Christian. Butler eventually gained control of the organization and moved it from California to Idaho in 1973. After moving to Idaho, Butler founded Aryan Nations as a paramilitary wing of the church with an ideological mixture of Christian Identity and Nazism.

From 1974 until 2001, the Aryan Nations headquarters was located in a 20-acre (8.1 ha) compound 1.8 miles (3 km) north of Hayden, Idaho. Aryan Nations had a number of state chapters, but it was highly decentralized and the chapters&#x27; ties to the organization&#x27;s headquarters were extremely loose. The group hosted an annual World Congress of Aryan Nations at Hayden Lake for Aryan Nations members and members of similar groups.

Aryan Nations had difficult relations with the city of Coeur d&#x27;Alene. In 1986-1987, there were a series of bombings of the homes of local human rights activists, after which, the city and Aryan Nations left each other alone. In 1998, Aryan Nations applied for a permit for a march in downtown Coeur d&#x27;Alene. Although the permit was approved, the city declared a public holiday on the same day, resulting in an empty downtown of closed businesses.

Until 1998, the leadership of Aryan Nations remained firmly in the hands of Richard Girnt Butler. By that time, he was over 80 years old, and his health was poor. As Butler&#x27;s health deteriorated, so did his ability to lead the group. This led to a series of violent events in Coeur d&#x27;Alene involving skinheads who had infiltrated the group.

At the annual Aryan Nations World Congress in 2001, Neuman Britton was appointed to lead Aryan Nations as Butler&#x27;s successor. Following Neuman&#x27;s death in August 2001, Butler appointed Harold Ray Redfeairn of Ohio to lead Aryan Nations as his successor; he had been agitating for control of the organization since the mid-1990s. Redfeairn had brought in Dave Hall, an FBI informant who exposed the group&#x27;s illegal activities. After this was discovered, Redfeairn was distrusted by some in the group. Redfeairn and August Kreis III, the propaganda minister for Aryan Nations, formed a splinter group, and Butler expelled them from Aryan Nations.

A few months later, Redfeairn returned to form an alliance with Butler. Butler&#x27;s 2002 World Congress drew fewer than 100 people, and when he ran for mayor, he lost, garnering only 50 votes against more than 2,100 votes. Redfeairn died in October 2003, and Butler died of heart failure in September 2004. At the time of Butler&#x27;s death, Aryan Nations had about 200 actively participating members.

===Shooting, lawsuit and breakup===

In September 2000, the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) won a $6.3 million judgment against Aryan Nations from an Idaho jury, who awarded punitive and compensatory damages to plaintiffs Victoria Keenan and her son Jason. The two Native Americans had been beaten with rifles by Aryan Nations security guards in Coeur d&#x27;Alene, Idaho in July 1998. The woman and her son were driving near the Aryan Nations compound when their car backfired, which the guards claimed to misinterpret as gunfire. The guards fired at the car, striking it several times. The car crashed and one of the Nations guards held the Keenans at gunpoint, beating them. Two of the assailants, Aryan Nations security chief Edward Jessie Warfield and guard John Yeager, were prosecuted for the attack. Warfield pleaded guilty to aggravated assault and was sentenced to two to five years in prison. Yeager entered an Alford plea for assault and was sentenced to up 2.5 years in prison. A third attacker was never found.

The SPLC filed suit on behalf of the Keenans. A jury found that Butler and Aryan Nations were grossly negligent in selecting and supervising the guards, and awarded the Keenans $6.3 million. A local attorney from Keenan&#x27;s legal team said that the large verdict was partly to compensate the Keenans, but largely to punish Butler and his followers, and serve to deter similar conduct in the future.

The $6.3 million verdict caused Butler to file for bankruptcy one month later. As part of the bankruptcy process, the group&#x27;s property was put up for auction. SPLC loaned the Keenans $95,000 to bid on the 20-acre property. In February 2001, the group&#x27;s Hayden Lake compound and intellectual property, including the names &quot;Aryan Nations&quot; and &quot;Church of Jesus Christ Christian&quot;, were transferred to the Keenans. Idaho native and millionaire philanthropist Greg Carr purchased the property from the Keenans, donating it to the North Idaho College Foundation. It has been converted to a park dedicated to peace.

Local fire departments demolished some of the church&#x27;s former buildings by burning them during training exercises. Edgar Steele, the attorney who had represented Butler, was later convicted of hiring a handyman to kill his own wife. In 2014, Steele died while serving a 50-year prison sentence.

===Decline and legacy===

The Aryan Nations were divided between three main factions. The largest group after Aryan Nations&#x27; bankruptcy was led by Charles John Juba, followed by August Kreis III until Kreis stepped down as leader and designated Drew Bostwick as his successor in 2012. In 2002, Juba&#x27;s group was based on a compound in the rural town of Ulysses in Potter County, north central Pennsylvania; it hosted the 2002 Aryan Nations World Congress. Juba resigned in March 2005, announcing that Kreis was the group&#x27;s new leader.

Kreis established a new headquarters in Lexington, South Carolina, and he eventually moved it close to Union City, Tennessee. In 2005, Kreis received media attention because he attempted to form an Aryan Nations–al Qaeda alliance.

In 2005, the Holy Order of the Phineas Priesthood, previously in association with the faction which was led by Kreis, seceded and formed Aryan Nations Revival, based in New York City. The Holy Order was created in opposition to Kreis&#x27;s acceptance of adherents of Wicca, Islam, and Odinism. It considered such groups to be a deviation from the core Christian Identity belief of Aryan Nations. This Revival rapidly became the largest faction.

In the &quot;Congressional Record&quot;, the leaders of Aryan Nations Revival were listed as domestic terrorists. The government concluded that the Holy Order of the Brotherhood of the Phineas Priesthood was the enforcement/terrorist wing of Aryan Nations. Aryan Nations Revival hosted a weekly radio broadcast which it titled &quot;The Aryan Nations Broadcast&quot;. Airing from 1979 to 2009, the radio program was authorized by Richard Butler. The program ended when host Hal Turner was arrested for threatening the lives of federal judges in Chicago. While incarcerated, Turner announced, through his attorney, that he was a federal informant, and that Aryan Nations was among those organizations which had been informed upon.

In 2009, Aryan Nations Revival, which was then based in Texas, merged with Pastor Jerald O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s Aryan Nations, which was based in Coeur d&#x27;Alene, Idaho. Both parties ardently adhered to Christian Identity.

==Symbols==

The emblem (or shield) of Aryan Nations is designed to reflect aspects of British Israelism.

==Associates==
In 1983, Robert Jay Mathews, who had visited the Aryan Nations compound many times, formed The Order, along with Aryan Nations members Dan Bauer, Randy Duey, Denver Parmenter, and Bruce Pierce. The Order&#x27;s mission was to overthrow the Zionist Occupational Government and establish the Northwest Territorial Imperative through an orchestrated plot to commit acts of domestic terrorism which would include murder, arson, armed robbery, theft, counterfeiting, and extortion between 1983 and 1984. Dennis McGiffen, who also had ties to Aryan Nations, formed a group called &quot;The New Order&quot;, inspired by Mathews&#x27; group. The members were arrested before they could follow through with their violent plans.

Buford O. Furrow, Jr., who was convicted of the Los Angeles Jewish Community Center shooting and the murder of Filipino American postal worker Joseph Ileto, had previously worked as a security guard at the Aryan Nations compound for some time.

On April 4, 2004, intending to start a &quot;Race War&quot;, Sean Michael Gillespie (a former member of Aryan Nations) threw a Molotov cocktail at B&#x27;nai Temple Israel in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. There were no casualties, but the building sustained material damage. Gillespie was arrested in Little Rock, Arkansas, on April 16 of the same year, but it was not until August 2005 that he was sentenced to 39 years in prison for attacking the Jewish temple and trying to send a racist letter to the congregation. The defendant raised his hand in a Nazi salute with stiff arms as the judge left the courtroom.

<text>A quatorzain (from Italian &quot;quattordici&quot; or French &quot;quatorze&quot;, fourteen) is a poem of fourteen lines. Historically the term has been used interchangeably with the term &quot;sonnet&quot;. Various writers have tried to draw distinctions between &quot;true&quot; sonnets and quatorzains. Nowadays the term is rarely used. When it is used, it is to distinguish fourteen-line poems that do not follow the various rules which describe the sonnet.

<doc id="51672" wikidata="Q1096079" url="?curid=51672" title="Vacuous truth">
<text>In mathematics and logic, a vacuous truth is a conditional or universal statement (a universal statement that can be converted to a conditional statement) that is true because the antecedent cannot be satisfied. 
It is sometimes said that a statement is vacuously true because it does not really say anything. For example, the statement &quot;all cell phones in the room are turned off&quot; will be true when no cell phones are present in the room. In this case, the statement &quot;all cell phones in the room are turned &quot;on&quot;&quot; would also be vacuously true, as would the conjunction of the two: &quot;all cell phones in the room are turned on &quot;and&quot; turned off&quot;, which would otherwise be incoherent and false.

More formally, a relatively well-defined usage refers to a conditional statement (or a universal conditional statement) with a false antecedent. One example of such a statement is &quot;if Tokyo is in Spain, then the Eiffel Tower is in Bolivia&quot;.

Such statements are considered vacuous truths because the fact that the antecedent is false prevents using the statement to infer anything about the truth value of the consequent. In essence, a conditional statement, that is based on the material conditional, is true when the antecedent (&quot;Tokyo is in Spain&quot; in the example) is false regardless of whether the conclusion or consequent (&quot;the Eiffel Tower is in Bolivia&quot; in the example) is true or false because the material conditional is defined in that way.

Examples common to everyday speech include conditional phrases used as idioms of improbability like &quot;when hell freezes over ...&quot; and &quot;when pigs can fly ...&quot;, indicating that not before the given (impossible) condition is met will the speaker accept some respective (typically false or absurd) proposition.

In pure mathematics, vacuously true statements are not generally of interest by themselves, but they frequently arise as the base case of proofs by mathematical induction. This notion has relevance in pure mathematics, as well as in any other field that uses classical logic.

Outside of mathematics, statements in the form of a vacuous truth, while logically valid, can nevertheless be misleading. Such statements make reasonable assertions about qualified objects which do not actually exist. For example, a child might truthfully tell their parent &quot;I ate every vegetable on my plate&quot;, when there were no vegetables on the child&#x27;s plate to begin with. In this case, the parent can believe that the child has actually eaten some vegetables, even though that is not true.

== Scope of the concept ==

A statement formula_1 is &quot;vacuously true&quot; if it resembles a material conditional statement formula_2, where the antecedent formula_3 is known to be false.

Vacuously true statements that can be reduced (with suitable transformations) to this basic form (material conditional) include the following universally quantified statements:
* formula_4, where it is the case that formula_5.
* formula_6, where the set formula_7 is empty.
** This logical form formula_6 can be converted to the material conditional form in order to easily identify the antecedent. For the above example formula_1 &quot;all cell phones in the room are turned off&quot;, it can be formally written as formula_6 where formula_7 is the set of all cell phones in the room and formula_12 is &quot;formula_13 is turned off&quot;. This can be written to a material conditional statement formula_14 where formula_15 is the set of all things in the room (including cell phones if they exist in the room), the antecedent formula_16 is &quot;formula_13 is a cell phone&quot;, and the consequent formula_12 is &quot;formula_13 is turned off&quot;.
* formula_20, where the symbol formula_21 is restricted to a type that has no representatives.

Vacuous truths most commonly appear in classical logic with two truth values. However, vacuous truths can also appear in, for example, intuitionistic logic, in the same situations as given above. Indeed, if formula_3 is false, then formula_2 will yield a vacuous truth in any logic that uses the material conditional; if formula_3 is a necessary falsehood, then it will also yield a vacuous truth under the strict conditional.

Other non-classical logics, such as relevance logic, may attempt to avoid vacuous truths by using alternative conditionals (such as the case of the counterfactual conditional).

== In computer programming ==
Many programming environments have a mechanism for querying if every item in a collection of items satisfies some predicate. It is common for such a query to always evaluate as true for an empty collection. For example:

* In JavaScript, the array method codice_1 executes a provided callback function once for each element present in the array, only stopping (if and when) it finds an element where the callback function returns false. Notably, calling the codice_1 method on an empty array will return true for any condition.
* In Python, the built in codice_3 function returns codice_4 only when all of the elements of an array are codice_4 or the array is of length zero as shown in these examples: codice_6. A less ambiguous way to express this is to say codice_3 returns True when none of the elements are False.
* In Rust, the codice_8 function accepts an iterator and a predicate and returns codice_9 only when the predicate returns codice_9 for all items produced by the iterator, or if the iterator produces no items.
* In SQL, the function, the function codice_11 can differ depending on the RDBMS&#x27;s behaviour relating NULLs to vacuous truth. Some RDBMS might return codice_12 even if there are non-codice_12 values. Some DBMS might not allow for its use in codice_14 or codice_15 clauses.
* In Kotlin, the collection method codice_16 returns codice_9 when the collection is empty.
* In C#, the Linq method codice_18 returns codice_9 when the collection is empty.
* In C++, the codice_20 function template returns codice_9 for an empty collection.

== Examples ==
These examples, one from mathematics and one from natural language, illustrate the concept of vacuous truths:

* &quot;For any integer &quot;x&quot;, if then .&quot; – This statement is true non-vacuously (since some integers are indeed greater than 5), but some of its implications are only vacuously true: for example, when &quot;x&quot; is the integer 2, the statement implies the vacuous truth that &quot;if then &quot;.
* &quot;All my children are goats&quot; is a vacuous truth when spoken by someone without children. Similarly, &quot;None of my children is a goat&quot; would also be a vacuous truth when spoken by the same person.

<doc id="51673" wikidata="Q64611" url="?curid=51673" title="Moro Islamic Liberation Front">
<text>The Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF; ) is an Islamist group based in Mindanao, Philippines, which sought an autonomous region of the Moro people from the central government. The group has a presence in the Bangsamoro region of Mindanao, the Sulu Archipelago, Palawan, Basilan, and other neighbouring islands. The armed wing of the group was the Bangsamoro Islamic Armed Forces (BIAF), although the name of its parent organization, the MILF, was often used to refer to the BIAF. 

In July 2018, the Philippine government passed the Bangsamoro Organic Law, giving more autonomy to Muslims. In return, MILF announced that it would disarm its 30,000 fighters.

==History==

Following the Jabidah massacre in 1968, the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) was established clandestinely in 1969 by Moro students studying at the University of the Philippines, Egypt, and in the Middle East who sought to create an independent Muslim nation in southern Philippines. The MNLF gained foreign support from Muammar Gaddafi of Libya, which supplied arms and provided training for Moro youths. The MNLF took part in terrorist attacks and assassinations to achieve their goals. The government in Manila sent troops into the southern Philippines to control the insurgency. In 1976, Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi brokered a negotiation between the Philippine government and MNLF Leader Nur Misuari which led to the signing of the MNLF-GRPH Tripoli Agreement of 1976 wherein the MNLF accepted the Philippine government&#x27;s offer of semi-autonomy of the regions in dispute.

The signing of this agreement brought about a serious rift in MNLF leadership, leading to the formation of a breakaway group in 1977 by Hashim Salamat and 57 MNLF officers. The group was initially known as &quot;The New Leadership&quot;. Misuari expelled Salamat in December 1977, after which Salamat moved his new organization first to Cairo, Egypt, and then, in 1980, to Lahore, Pakistan, where it engaged in diplomatic activities. This organization was formally established in 1984 as the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). Muammar Gaddafi became a longstanding supporter of the MILF after its emergence.

In January 1987, the MNLF accepted the Philippine government&#x27;s offer of semi-autonomy of the regions in dispute, subsequently leading to the establishment of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao on November 6, 1990. The MILF, however, refused to accept this offer and continued their insurgency operations. A general cessation of hostilities between the government in Manila and the MILF was signed in July 1997, but this agreement was abolished in 2000 by the Philippine Army under the administration of President Joseph Estrada. In response, the MILF declared a jihad against the government, its citizens and supporters. Under President Gloria Arroyo, the government entered into a cease-fire agreement with the MILF and resumed peace talks.

Despite peace negotiations and the cease-fire agreement, the MILF attacked government troops in Maguindanao, resulting in at least twenty-three deaths in January 2005. The combined armies of the MILF and Abu Sayyaf were involved in days of fighting, which necessitated government troops using heavy artillery to engage rebel forces.

The bombing incident in Davao Airport in 2003, which the Philippine government blamed on MILF members, raised speculation that the peace negotiations would be ineffectual in bringing peace to Mindanao if the MILF was unable to control its operatives. The MILF has denied ties with terrorist group Jemaah Islamiyah, although Jemaah Islamiyah is considered to have provided them with training facilities in areas they control. The MILF has also continued to deny connections with Al-Qaeda, though it has admitted to sending around 600 volunteers to Al-Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan and that Osama bin Laden sent money to the Philippines, though the group denies directly receiving any payment.

From June 28 to July 6, 2006, conflict between the MILF and armed civilian volunteers under Maguindanao provincial governor Andal Ampatuan who were supported by the Philippine Army had been reported. The fighting began after Ampatuan blamed the MILF for a June 23 bomb attack on his motorcade, which killed five in his entourage. The MILF denied responsibility, but Ampatuan sent police and civilian volunteers to arrest MILF members connected to the attack. Four thousand families were reported displaced by the fighting that followed, which was ended by a cease-fire agreement signed on July 10 and 11.

Talks between the MILF and the government collapsed in 2008 after a Supreme Court decision in Sema vs. COMELEC rejected a preliminary accord that would have expanded the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. In 2011, the MILF withdrew their demands for independence, instead saying that they would pursue substate status, likened to a U.S. state instead of independence from the Philippines.

==Struggles==

===Memorandum of Agreement on Ancestral Domain===
On August 4, 2008, the Supreme Court of the Philippines issued a temporary restraining order, preventing the government and the MILF from officially signing the Memorandum of Agreement on Ancestral Domain (MOA-AD), which would conclude all dispute and begin formal talks that would lead to the drafting and eventual signing of a Final Comprehensive Compact between the two groups. The court accepted motions by the southern provincial governments that objected to the extended boundaries for the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao envisioned in the peace deal. The MOA-AD would have allowed the Moro people to gain control of the region under the concept of human rights with the right to establish a police force and to control natural resources.

The MOA-AD was initialed by former governor and peace panel chair Rodolfo Garcia and Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process Hermogenes Esperon and MILF peace panel chair Mohagher Iqbal on July 27, 2008, in Malaysia. It was scheduled for formal signing on August 5, but the Supreme Court issued no negotiation preventing the executive department from signing the agreement. The MOA-AD was the last of several agenda items under the 2001 agreement of the GRP-MILF, after security and relief and rehabilitation, prior to the discussion on the political settlement.

The Young Moro Professionals Network (YMPN) appealed to the public not to be afraid of the MOA-AD and to &quot;open your hearts to the Moro grievance&quot;. The YMPN said in a statement dated August 21, 2009:
In these times of hardship, we hold hands as one, with our Christian and Islamic neighbours, in the name of peace, acceptance and justice. We are committed to democratic and peaceful resolution of the conflict. Do not be afraid of the MOA-AD. To the national public, open your hearts to the Moro grievance.

Over the next month, several MILF commanders were tagged by government officials as having initiated an offensive campaign. The Armed Forces of the Philippines responded to the allegation by immediately deploying ten battalions composed of a total of 6,000 soldiers into Mindanao under the command of Lt. Gen. Cardozo Luna. The violence displaced over 600,000 people and left about 300 dead.

On October 14, 2008, the court conducted a series of divided votes declared &quot;contrary to law and the Constitution&quot; the MOA-AD of the Government of the Republic of the Philippines and Moro Islamic Liberation Front Tripoli Agreement of Peace on 2001. Conchita Carpio-Morales ruled: &quot;In sum, the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process committed grave abuse of discretion when he failed to carry out the pertinent consultation process. The furtive process by which the MOA-AD was designed and crafted runs contrary to and in excess of the legal authority and amounts to a whimsical, capricious, oppressive, arbitrary and despotic exercise thereof. It illustrates a gross evasion of positive duty and a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined.&quot;

Civil society organizations such as Consortium of Bangsamoro Civil Society submitted a motion for reconsideration. However, on November 21, 2008, the Supreme Court affirmed its October 14 ruling that declared unconstitutional the MOA-AD between the Philippine government and the MILF.

MILF soldiers offered to help free the Irish priest father Michael Sinott, who was kidnapped in the Philippines on October 14, 2009, and sought permission to deploy about 100 of its soldiers in the area where Sinnott is believed to be held. However, this was turned down by the Philippine government.

===Modification of demands===
On September 23, 2010, Mohagher Iqbal said that the MILF would pursue a substate, likened to a U.S. state, instead of independence from the Philippines. The Muslim substate would not exercise power over national defense, foreign affairs, currency and coinage, and postal services, which the central government would continue to exercise. Iqbal further added that the substate would not have its own armed forces but instead would have troops for internal security.

===Peace talks===

&quot;Moro women were initially disenfranchised in the peace talks, even if they are equal stakeholders in the war making and peacebuilding in Mindanao, and that &quot;the war years took their toll mostly on women and children&quot; (Arguillas 2014).&quot; Jopson said. There were no Moro women publicly involved in the peace talks. The all-men panels reflected the military framework of the earlier talks.

Emily Marohombsar was the first Moro woman negotiator for the GPH from 1998 to 2004. The rounds of peace talks from 2010 was more diverse in terms of participation and leadership. Women&#x27;s involvment in peace talks justified the limited scope and narrow focus of gender content in the peace documents, since securing the BARMM was the main goal and the Moro identity was important.

On October 7, 2012, President Benigno Aquino announced a peace deal with the MILF and that &quot;This framework agreement paves the way for a final and enduring peace in Mindanao&quot;. MILF vice-chair Ghazali Jaafar said, &quot;We are very happy. We thank the president for this.&quot; The deal was signed on October 15, 2012. Its aim is to pave the way to enduring peace between the two parties by officially envisaging an autonomous region in Mindanao.

According to the framework, this semi-independent Muslim area would have a more just share of revenues from the extraction of its own plentiful resources, budgetary autonomy, its own police, and sharia law only for Muslims. In exchange for this, the MILF would be willing to stop armed movements against the government for autonomy and allow the national government to retain its control of national security and foreign policy. The autonomy agreement to be gradually implemented would also rename the region &quot;Bangsamoro&quot;, after the Moro people.

Chief peace negotiator Miriam Coronel-Ferrer said that the government was cautiously optimistic for a final agreement soon following six days of talks on July 13, 2013. She said: &quot;This signing indicates that both sides are really committed to finish the peace negotiations. Nobody wants this not to reach its fruition.&quot; The agreement would see government allowances for the MILF to have a 75 percent share of earnings from natural resources and metallic minerals in a proposed autonomous region. For other energy resources, earnings would be split equally in accordance with Malaysia-brokered talks.

===Peace agreement===
On January 24, 2014, Philippine government chief negotiator Miriam Coronel Ferrer and MILF chief negotiator Mohagher Iqbal signed a peace agreement in Kuala Lumpur. The agreement would pave the way for the creation of the new Muslim autonomous entity called &quot;Bangsamoro&quot; under a law to be approved by the Philippine Congress. The government aimed to set up the region by 2016. The agreement called for Muslim self-rule in parts of the southern Philippines in exchange for a deactivation of rebel forces by the MILF. MILF forces would turn over their firearms to a third party selected by the MILF and the Philippine government. A regional police force would be established, and the Philippine military would reduce the presence of troops and help disband private armies in the area. President Rodrigo Duterte signed the law, a key step to ending a Muslim rebellion in the south of the mainly Catholic Philippines. In early January 2020, the Office of the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process announced progress exceeding its target for the decommissioning of MILF fighters, noting that &quot;8,879 out of the 12,000 MILF combatants were decommissioned from the last quarter of 2019&quot;. Some former rebel fighters have joined the police and military to protect certain areas of the Bangsamoro region until an elected government is established in 2022.

As of 2023, the MILF is steering the BARMM and started decommissioning in 2019, and the peace negotiators are preparing for an exit agreement.

<doc id="51679" wikidata="Q1236206" url="?curid=51679" title="The Powerpuff Girls">
<text>The Powerpuff Girls is an American superhero animated television series created by animator Craig McCracken and produced by Hanna-Barbera (later Cartoon Network Studios) for Cartoon Network. The show centers on Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup, three kindergarten-aged girls with superpowers. They live in the fictional city of Townsville with their father and creator, a scientist named Professor Utonium, and are frequently called upon by the city&#x27;s mayor to help fight nearby criminals and other enemies using their powers.

While attending his second year at CalArts in 1992, McCracken created a short film, &quot;Whoopass Stew!&quot;, about a trio of child superheroes known as the Whoopass Girls, which was only shown at festivals. Following the name change to &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot;, McCracken submitted his student film to Cartoon Network, who aired the series&#x27; refined pilot, &quot;Meat Fuzzy Lumpkins&quot;, in its animation showcase program &quot;World Premiere Toons&quot; on February 20, 1995, along with its follow-up, &quot;Crime 101&quot;, on January 28, 1996. Network executives gave McCracken the greenlight for a full series, which debuted as a Cartoon Cartoon on November 18, 1998.

&quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot; aired on Cartoon Network for six seasons, three specials, and a feature film, with the final episode airing on March 25, 2005. A total of 78 episodes were produced, in addition to the two pilots, a Christmas special, the film, a tenth anniversary special, and a special episode in computer animation. Various spin-off media include an anime, three CD soundtracks, a home video collection, comic books, a series of video games, a 2016 reboot series, and an upcoming reboot series, as well as various licensed merchandise. The series has been nominated for six Emmy Awards, nine Annie Awards, and a Kids&#x27; Choice Award during its run.

== Premise ==
The show revolves around the adventures of three kindergarten-aged girls with an array of various superpowers: Blossom (pink), Bubbles (blue), and Buttercup (green). The plot of an episode is usually some humorous variation of standard superhero and tokusatsu shows, with the girls using their powers to defend their town from villains and giant monsters. In addition, the girls have to deal with the normal issues that young children face, such as sibling rivalries, loose teeth, personal hygiene, going to school, bed wetting, or dependence on a security blanket. Episodes often contain hidden references to older pop culture (especially noticeable in the episode &quot;Meet the Beat Alls&quot;, which is a homage to the Beatles). The cartoon always tries to keep different ideas within each episode with some small tributes and parodies thrown in.

The show is set mainly in the city of Townsville, USA. Townsville is depicted as a major American city, with a cityscape consisting of several major skyscrapers. In his review of &quot;The Powerpuff Girls Movie&quot;, movie critic Bob Longino of &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; said, &quot;the intricate drawings emanate 1950s futuristic pizzazz like a David Hockney scenescape,&quot; and that the show is &quot;one of the few American creations that is both gleeful pop culture and exquisite high art.&quot;

== Episodes ==

== Characters ==


As depicted in the opening sequence of each episode, the Powerpuff Girls Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup were created by Professor Utonium in an attempt to create the &quot;perfect little girl&quot; using a mixture of &quot;sugar, spice, and everything nice&quot;. However, he accidentally spilled a mysterious substance called &quot;Chemical X&quot; into the mixture, creating three girls and granting them superpowers, including flight, superhuman strength, superhuman speed, superhuman senses, limited invulnerability, x-ray vision, red heat vision, energy projection, space survivability, and thermal resistance. In the original concept, the accidental substance was , which was replaced by &quot;Chemical X&quot; in the television show.

The three girls all have abnormally large eyes inspired by Margaret Keane&#x27;s art, and stubby arms and legs, and lack of noses, ears, fingers, flat feet, toes, and necks. McCracken preferred them to look more symbolic of actual children rather than going for a &quot;realistic&quot; look, meaning fewer body parts were needed. Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup normally wear dresses that match the colors of their eyes with black stripes, as well as white stockings and black Mary Janes. They individually represent body, mind and spirit, and despite being the same age, they adopt the characteristics of the oldest, middle and youngest child. The closing theme song offers a nutshell description of their personalities: &quot;Blossom, commander and the leader. Bubbles, she is the joy and the laughter. Buttercup, she is the toughest fighter.&quot;

* Blossom (voiced by Cathy Cavadini) is the self-appointed leader of the Powerpuff Girls. Her personality ingredient is &quot;everything nice&quot;, her signature color is pink, and she has long orange hair with a red bow. She was named for having spoken freely and honestly to the Professor shortly after her creation, as shown in &quot;The Powerpuff Girls Movie&quot;. She often behaves as the most level-headed and composed member of the group, with a strong and determined attitude. Her unique abilities include ice breath, microscopic vision, lightning bolts, and advanced intelligence. As the leader, she is a master strategist and apt planner, so she figures everything out and keeps control of the situations.
* Bubbles (voiced by Tara Strong in the series, and by Kath Soucie in the &quot;What a Cartoon!&quot; episodes) is the &quot;softest and sweetest&quot; of the three. She is the most innocent and childish, as she most enjoys the regular occupations of any child, such as playing games and coloring. Her personality ingredient is &quot;sugar&quot;, her signature color is blue, and she has blonde hair in pigtails. Bubbles is kind and sweet, but she is also capable of extreme rage and fights just as well as her sisters. She loves animals and her best friend is a stuffed octopus doll she calls &quot;Octi&quot;. She has the ability to both understand multiple languages and communicate with various animals. Her unique powers are projecting powerful sonic screams, and creating a shockwave of thunder with a single clap from her hands.
* Buttercup (voiced by E. G. Daily) is described as a &quot;tough hotheaded tomboy&quot;. Her personality ingredient is &quot;spice&quot;, her signature color is green, and she has short black hair in a bob cut. She loves to fight hard, play rough and get dirty; she does not plan and only wants to punish the bad guys instead of solving the crimes. Her unique powers are curling her tongue, spinning into a tornado, and creating fireballs by rubbing her hands together until smoke comes out. This action forms a flaming ball that she throws at an opponent. McCracken originally wanted to name the character &quot;Bud&quot;, until a friend suggested the name Buttercup.

== Production ==
During Craig McCracken&#x27;s first year in the character animation program of CalArts, he wanted to produce an animated short film based on a wrestler-type character he made named &quot;El Fuego&quot;. In June 1991, he drew three girls with large eyes, visually inspired by the paintings of Margaret Keane, on a small sheet of orange construction paper as a birthday card design for his brother. Looking for some &quot;diversity and balance&quot; in the drawing, he had created a blonde, a redhead, and a brunette. He liked how &quot;cute&quot; they looked and turned them into superheroes, thus replacing the aforementioned wrestler. The following year, the girls starred on McCracken&#x27;s animated short &quot;Whoopass Stew! The Whoopass Girls in: A Sticky Situation&quot;. Initially, McCracken wanted to animate all four &quot;Whoopass Girls&quot; shorts, but only one was produced. McCracken&#x27;s shorts were selected to be shown at Spike and Mike&#x27;s Sick and Twisted Festival of Animation in 1994.

While he was working on &quot;2 Stupid Dogs&quot; in 1992, McCracken&#x27;s &quot;Whoopass Girls&quot; short was picked up for a series by Cartoon Network. The name &quot;Whoopass&quot; was dropped for inclusion as part of the &quot;What a Cartoon!&quot; animated shorts showcase. McCracken explained that Cartoon Network executives believed no one would make a children&#x27;s show with the word &quot;ass&quot; in it, so the title changed to &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot; and the &quot;can of whoopass&quot; was renamed &quot;Chemical X&quot;. McCracken&#x27;s new short, titled &quot;The Powerpuff Girls in: Meat Fuzzy Lumpkins&quot;, aired as part the network&#x27;s &quot;World Premiere Toon-In&quot; on February 20, 1995. The short was not as popular as &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot;, a project McCracken and former classmate Genndy Tartakovsky (who also directed many episodes of &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot;) worked on together; being the most popular of the shorts, &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot; was the first to be greenlit by the network. Furthermore, McCracken&#x27;s cartoon did not do well with a test audience composed by 11-year-old boys; &quot;They were saying, &#x27;This is stupid, little girls can&#x27;t be heroes&#x27;&quot;, he recalled in 1999. They also found the girls&#x27; designs to be disturbing, which caused McCracken to panic and attempt to redesign them in a more realistic style. However, Cartoon Network executive Mike Lazzo convinced McCracken to stay true to his original vision, and allowed him to produce a second &quot;Powerpuff Girls&quot; short titled &quot;Crime 101&quot;, which aired on &quot;What a Cartoon!&quot; in early 1996. Veteran ABC announcer Ernie Anderson, who narrated the pilot episodes and died of cancer in 1997, was replaced by Tom Kenny when it became a series.

Following the second short, Cartoon Network picked up &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot; for a regular animated series. McCracken said that the show did not go through a large development process, but he was advised to change the name of the three main characters to Pink, Blue and Green, since the network executives found it hard to differentiate them by Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup. Instead, he put together a bible for the show, explaining the essential aspects of the characters. &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot; series debuted on November 18, 1998, and was the highest-rated premiere in Cartoon Network&#x27;s history at the time. During its run, the series consistently scored the highest rating for an original series each week for the network across a wide range of demographics—from young children to adults. In October 2000, Cartoon Network credited the series for its Friday night prime time ratings win among cable networks. By the end of 2000, merchandising based on the series encompassed a whole variety of products, including T-shirts, toys, video games, lunchboxes, and dishware. Concerning the show&#x27;s success, Craig McCracken has stated, &quot;I thought it would get on Cartoon Network and college kids would watch it and there would be a few random T-shirts out there in the rave scene or in record shops. But I had no idea that it would take off to this extent.&quot; The cost per each episode was $500,000. A theatrical film based on the show, &quot;The Powerpuff Girls Movie&quot;, was also commissioned that year and was released July 3, 2002. The film received positive reviews from critics but was a commercial failure, earning $16 million worldwide against its $11 million budget. The production of the film also marked the series&#x27; switch from traditional cel animation to the digital ink and paint technique.

Following the series&#x27; fourth season, the closing of Hanna-Barbera Productions and the death of its executive William Hanna in 2001, along with the muted reception to &quot;The Powerpuff Girls Movie&quot;, McCracken left the series to focus on developing his next animated series for the network, &quot;Foster&#x27;s Home for Imaginary Friends&quot;, leaving Chris Savino to take his place while production of &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot; was moved to Cartoon Network Studios. The show&#x27;s last original run episode was on March 25, 2005; in all, six seasons were made. Cartoon Network had offered to give McCracken and Savino a seventh season of the series, but they believed six was enough, and that the series had run its course. 

All of the original episodes were hand-drawn and produced at the Korean studio Rough Draft Studios, except the &quot;What a Cartoon!&quot; shorts, with the first one being animated at Animal House in Japan and the second being animated at Fil Cartoons in the Philippines. James L. Venable, Thomas Chase, &amp; Steve Rucker composed the opening theme of the series, and Scottish band Bis performed the ending theme song, as played during the credits. The opening theme uses a sped-up drum break sample of &quot;Funky Drummer&quot; performed by Clyde Stubblefield.

=== Tenth anniversary special ===
In August 2008, McCracken revealed on his DeviantArt account, as had been announced in that year&#x27;s Comic Con, that he was working with Cartoon Network on a new half-hour &quot;The&quot; &quot;Powerpuff Girls&quot; special to celebrate the series&#x27; tenth anniversary. Titled &quot;The Powerpuff Girls Rule!!!&quot;, it aired on the Pan-Euro Cartoon Network on November 29, 2008, during the Powerpuff Girls Birthday Marathon, and in the United States on January 19, 2009, as part of its 10th anniversary marathon. Originally an idea for season 4, the special was meant to be the final episode of the series, but Cartoon Network was against giving their series a definitive ending at the time. Unlike all the previous episodes, the special was animated using Adobe Flash at Cartoon Network Studios. It also provides a glimpse of Sara Bellum&#x27;s face as an easter egg, which at the time could be captured with a TiVo digital video recorder.

=== 2014 special ===
On January 28, 2013, a CGI special titled &quot;Powerpuff Girls: Dance Pantsed&quot; was announced to premiere that year, though it was later delayed to January 20, 2014. Former Beatle Ringo Starr promoted the special on Cartoon Network singing a new original song &quot;I Wish I Was a Powerpuff Girl&quot; with previews leading up to the airdate. Ringo also voiced a new character named Fibonacci Sequins in the episode. The special was directed by Dave Smith, who directed episodes for the series in the past, and featured the original cast members reprising their roles. This &quot;Powerpuff Girls&quot; special marked the first time that series creator Craig McCracken had no input. The episode&#x27;s plot has Mojo Jojo kidnap Fibonacci along with an opera singer and a badger. The girls rescue all of them, and the Powerpuff Girls defeat Mojo yet again. Not deterred, he then goes on to invent an evil video game called &quot;Dance Pants R-EVILution&quot; (a parody of the video game &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot;) to take over Townsville. Common Sense Media gave the special 3/5 stars citing the &quot;tasteful update of the original animation style&quot; however recommends it for older kids around the age of 7. Geeked Out Nation gave the show a B rank and described it as &quot;...a good special with the return of the characters that many of us grew up [with]&quot;, while they said that the special has few flaws. &quot;Den of Geek&quot; gave the special a 2.5 out 5 said &quot;The Powerpuff reboot needs those paddles to jump-start it. I want more. But I want better.&quot;
== Reception ==
=== Critical reception ===
In a 2000 &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; review, Marc Bernardin complimented the show on its &quot;spot-on pop-culture acumen&quot; and &quot;unparalleled sense of fun&quot;, giving it a warm welcome from earlier &quot;lame&quot; superhero cartoons that he grew up with. Peter Marks of &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted the show&#x27;s use of adult humor and pop culture references, declaring it &quot;the sort of playful satire that can appeal as much to a viewer of 37 as 7.&quot; Joly Herman of Common Sense Media described the show as a &quot;cute, highly stylized series [that] thrills the senses with its strange characters, funny situations, and lots of lowbrow humor&quot;. She went on to say, however, that the show does go from innocent to violent in no time and that there is not much protecting young viewers against the violent undertones. Robert Lloyd of the &quot;LA Times&quot; said that the series might be &quot;transgressive&quot; based on little violence, but &quot;also cute.&quot; In another review, he had called it &quot;perfectly drawn, perfectly written and perfectly voiced.&quot;

The show began airing at the height of the &quot;Girl power&quot; trend in entertainment media. The Powerpuff Girls were often compared to the likes of Sailor Moon, Lara Croft, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer, who are also strong and heroic female leads. Craig McCracken argued that he did not create the show to fill a gap in the market encompassed by the &quot;Girl Power&quot; slogan, but that its true vehicle was &quot;good, strong characters&quot; that made for good storytelling. However, he did believe that it gained momentum from being considered a &quot;girl power&quot; cartoon, and that it became successful among boys and girls for the inclusion of action scenes. Terrence Briggs of &quot;Animation World Network&quot; noted that, &quot;at the very least, &quot;Powerpuff Girls&quot; works as an interesting comic deviation from the more sexual presences&quot; of other fictional heroines.

&quot;TV Guide&quot; chose &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot; as No. 13 in a list of the 50 Greatest cartoon characters of all time. &quot;IGN&quot; ranked the series 18th in its Top 25 Primetime Animated Series of All Time list in 2006. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave it the number one spot in its list of &quot;10 Best Cartoon Network Shows&quot; in 2012.

=== Awards and nominations ===
The &quot;Powerpuff Girls&quot; series has won two Primetime Emmys, two Annie Awards, and including those four wins, has been nominated a total of sixteen times for various awards.

== Other media ==
=== Film ===

&quot;The Powerpuff Girls Movie&quot; was released in the United States on July 3, 2002, by Warner Bros. Pictures. The movie, a prequel to the series, tells the story of how the Powerpuff Girls were created, and how Mojo Jojo became a supervillain. The movie received a rating of 63% at review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, as well as some criticism for the violence involved. In all, the movie grossed $16 million worldwide with an $11 million budget.

=== Anime adaptation ===

In April 2005, plans for a Japanese anime series based on the cartoon, &quot;Demashita! Powerpuff Girls Z&quot;, were announced. The series premiered in Japan the following year with 52 half-hour episodes, airing each Saturday from July 1 to December 23, 2006, and from January 6 to June 30, 2007. &quot;Powerpuff Girls Z&quot; deviates from the original series in terms of genre and animation style. It features junior high school students Momoko Akatsutsumi (Hyper Blossom), Miyako Gotokuji (Rolling Bubbles), and Kaoru Matsubara (Powered Buttercup) as the three heroes. McCracken told NPR&#x27;s &quot;Talk of the Nation&quot; that he had little involvement in this version: &quot;I said, well, as long you keep that core foundation the same, feel free to reinterpret or re-imagine it in a way that you feel is going to better play in your marketplace [...] once we did the initial development on it, I kind of gave them my blessing and said, you guys can go off and make this show [...] I was really just there in the initial conception of it.&quot;

=== Aviation ===
Delta Express promoted the series by having a Boeing 737-232 jet painted with a special livery featuring the characters Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup on its exterior. The plane&#x27;s inaugural flight was held at Logan International Airport in Boston, Massachusetts, on July 17, 2000. It was approved to serve in 21 airports. In 2002 the aircraft was repainted with a different &quot;Powerpuff Girls&quot; theme to promote &quot;The Powerpuff Girls Movie&quot;.

=== Cancelled live-action adaptation ===
On August 24, 2020, a live-action television series based on &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot; was announced to be in development at The CW. According to &quot;Variety&quot;, it would depict Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup as &quot;disillusioned twentysomethings&quot; resentful at losing their childhood to fighting crime and faced with the choice of reuniting &quot;when the world needs them more than ever.&quot; The project, produced by Warner Bros. Television Studios, was being written by Heather Regnier and Diablo Cody, who were also serving as executive producers with Greg Berlanti, Sarah Schechter and David Madden. Craig McCracken was not involved; however, he declared his liking of Berlanti&#x27;s superhero shows and admitted he was &quot;curious&quot; to see what they would do with their adaptation. Genndy Tartakovsky, who directed and produced several episodes of the original show, also expressed a similar sentiment, suggesting that the idea was &quot;strong&quot; and could work if there&#x27;s &quot;good people attached to it&quot;.

A pilot was officially ordered on February 9, 2021, and Maggie Kiley was hired as the director. &quot;Variety&quot; later reported that Chloe Bennet, Dove Cameron and Yana Perrault were cast as Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup. On March 30, 2021, following the title change to &quot;Powerpuff&quot;, Donald Faison was cast in the role of Professor &quot;Drake&quot; Utonium. On April 1, Nicholas Podany was cast as Joseph &quot;Jojo&quot; Mondel Jr., the son of Mojo Jojo. On April 7, production on the pilot began. On April 9, Robyn Lively was cast as Sara Bellum and Tom Kenny was confirmed to be reprising his role as the Narrator from the original series. On May 24, The CW announced that the pilot would be reworked off-cycle, with the cast and crew remaining on board. The script was later leaked to overwhelmingly negative reviews on social media. Mark Pedowitz, the head of The CW, stated that the script would be largely rewritten. On August 11, Bennet dropped out of the project due to scheduling conflicts. In May 2022, it was said to be in &quot;some stage&quot; of redevelopment. However, on May 18, 2023, The CW announced that the series had been cancelled by its new majority owners, Nexstar Media Group, and that the rights had been returned to Warner Bros. On July 5, it was reported that the series was no longer in development at Warner Bros. Television.

=== Merchandise ===
In 2001, Warner Bros. Consumer Products deemed &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot; 
their flagship brand, given the success of the show&#x27;s merchandise. The International Licensing Industry Merchandisers Association (LIMA) named it License of the Year at their 2001 awards ceremony. The array of products was so extensive in 2002 that, according to Janan Sheria of the &quot;Dayton Daily News&quot;, even people without cable television could recognize the Powerpuff Girls. The franchise made nearly $1 billion in retail sales by 2002, according to Cartoon Network.

Beginning in 1999, Trendmasters made Powerpuff Girls dolls, playsets, and action figures, aimed primarily at girls ages 6–11. Craig McCracken and Genndy Tartakovsky were initially involved in the conception of these toys. From August 21 to October 1, 2000, Subway promoted the series with four toys in their kids&#x27; meals. A set of six kids&#x27; meal toys was available as part of an April 2001 Dairy Queen promotion, which also included a sweepstakes offering the &quot;Powerpuff Girls&quot; VHS &quot;Boogie Frights&quot;. Jack in the Box released six &quot;Powerpuff Girls&quot; toys in July 2002 as a tie-in for &quot;The Powerpuff Girls Movie&quot;. On February 10, 2003, Burger King began a four-week promotion featuring &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot; and &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; toys as well as special codes to redeem online for Cartoon Network&#x27;s Cartoon Orbit. In the United Kingdom the characters of Buttercup and Mojo Jojo were given away in Kellogg&#x27;s cereal boxes as part of the Cartoon Network Wobble Heads in 2003.

From 2000 to 2006, DC published a series of seventy comics based on the television show. Golden Books also published a series of &quot;Powerpuff Girls&quot;-themed activity books and storybooks, including one written and illustrated by Craig McCracken, titled &quot;Big, Terrible Trouble?&quot;. Around 400,000 total units of these books had been sold by 2001. From 2013 to 2017, IDW Publishing published a range of comics based on the series. In 2014, that company published a variant cover which showed aged-up versions of Powerpuff Girls with breasts and dressed in latex. The cover was designed by an artist working for Cartoon Network who was &quot;thinking of it more along the lines of &#x27;female empowerment&#x27; than the kind of thing you guys are talking about&quot;. Cartoon Network said in a statement: &quot;We recognise some fans&#x27; reaction to the cover and, as such, will no longer be releasing it at comic book shops.&quot;

On October 12, 2023, Dynamite announced a deal with Warner Bros. Discovery to create a new line of comics based on various properties, including &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot;. The first issue was released in July 17, 2024.

=== Music ===

Three CD soundtracks were officially released for the series. The first, titled &quot;Heroes &amp; Villains&quot;, features original songs about the &quot;Powerpuff Girls&quot; characters by a number of artists, including the new wave group Devo, Bis, The Apples in Stereo and Frank Black. Mark Mothersbaugh, who originally sought out to be the series&#x27; composer, produced the album along with Bob Casale, his bandmate of Devo. The album did well, topping the &quot;Billboard&quot;″s children&#x27;s music chart for six weeks. Another album titled &quot;The City of Soundsville&quot; features electronica-style character themes and also did well with critics. The third album, titled &quot;Power Pop&quot;, features a more teen-oriented variety of pop songs. This third and final album was considered a &quot;big disappointment&quot; and was not received as well as the previous albums. The British girl group Sugababes also released a song called &quot;Angels with Dirty Faces&quot; to promote &quot;The Powerpuff Girls Movie&quot;. The song received generally positive reviews from critics and peaked at number seven on the UK Singles Chart. The music video hearkens to &quot;Nano of the North&quot;, an episode from the fourth season of &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot;, in which each Sugababes member portrays a Powerpuff Girl.

=== Parodies ===
A crossover parody of &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot; and &quot;2 Broke Girls&quot; was done in the second season of Cartoon Network&#x27;s TV series &quot;MAD&quot;, known as &quot;2 Broke Powerpuff Girls&quot;. The episode, which aired on January 30, 2012, is of Bubbles and Buttercup, who are broke and work for &quot;Him&quot; in a diner after the show got placed on permanent hiatus. Tara Strong (Bubbles) and Tom Kane (&quot;Him&quot;) reprised their roles here. The &quot;MAD&quot; episode with the parody ranked #26/30 for the week with 1.903 million viewers.

=== Video games ===

Several video games were made for this show all being action in genre. &quot;The Powerpuff Girls: Bad Mojo Jojo&quot;, released on November 14, 2000, follows Blossom as she tries to beat Mojo Jojo. The game was called &quot;simple and boring&quot; by GameSpot and was a failure critically. &quot;The Powerpuff Girls: Paint the Townsville Green&quot;, another game released in November 2000, follows Buttercup as she fights crime. &quot;The Powerpuff Girls: Battle HIM&quot; follows Bubbles in her fight against HIM and was released in February 2001. &quot;The Powerpuff Girls: Chemical X-traction&quot; was released in October 2001, where the girls battle enemies in a variety of settings in order to reclaim Chemical X and track down Mojo Jojo, who fed the material to all the villains in Townsville. &quot;IGN&quot; gave the game a positive review while giving the PSone version a 2.0/10 bad review. &quot;The Powerpuff Girls: Relish Rampage&quot; was released in November 2002. All three girls are playable in a 3D world, and the game received mixed reviews. &quot;The Powerpuff Girls: Mojo Jojo A-Go-Go&quot; released in 2001 centers around the name of the Powerpuff Girls&#x27; mission to stop Mojo Jojo and his minions. The game received mixed reviews. &quot;The Powerpuff Girls: HIM and Seek&quot; was released in 2002 where the girls battle their variety of enemies through Townsville while on a scavenger hunt. The game received mostly positive reviews. PC games were also made for the series. These include: &quot;The Powerpuff Girls: Mojo Jojo Clone Zone&quot;, &quot;The Powerpuff Girls: Princess Snorebucks&quot;, &quot;The Powerpuff Girls: Mojo Jojo&#x27;s Pet Project&quot;, and &quot;The Powerpuff Girls: Gamesville&quot;.

<text>Paula Danziger (August 18, 1944 – July 8, 2004) was an American children&#x27;s author. She wrote more than 30 books, including her 1974 debut &quot;The Cat Ate My Gymsuit&quot;, for children&#x27;s and young adult audiences. At the time of her death, all her books were still in print; they had been published in 53 countries and translated into 14 languages.

== Life ==
=== Birth and family ===
Paula Danziger was born August 18, 1944, to Samuel and Carolyn Danziger. A younger brother, Barry, was born in 1947.

=== Education and early career ===
The Danziger family lived in Nutley, New Jersey, and Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania, before settling in Metuchen, New Jersey, when Paula was in sixth grade. In an interview with &quot;BookPage&quot;, she said: &quot;At age 12, I was put on tranquilizers when I should have gotten help. There was nothing major and awful. I just didn&#x27;t feel [my family] was supportive and emotionally generous. My father was a very unhappy person, very sarcastic, and my mother [was] very nervous and worried about what people thought. They weren&#x27;t monsters, but it wasn&#x27;t a good childhood.&quot; She graduated from Metuchen High School.

She was encouraged to study nursing in college but instead studied to become a teacher at Montclair State University, where she was mentored by poet John Ciardi. After earning a bachelor&#x27;s degree in education, Danziger taught junior high school English while pursuing a master&#x27;s degree. After being injured in an automobile accident, she had trouble writing, as she was only able to write backwards. She was able to regain the ability to write normally, but she remained able to write backwards for the rest of her life. This sequence of events prompted her to do what she really want to do in life; she began writing.

Following the success of &quot;The Cat Ate My Gymsuit&quot;, Danziger left teaching to write full-time in 1978. She maintained homes in New York City and in Bearsville, New York. For several years, she had a flat in London, where she was known for presenting a regular item about children&#x27;s literature on the BBC&#x27;s Saturday-morning show &quot;Live &amp; Kicking&quot; in the 1980s and 1990s.

=== Death ===
On June 9, 2004, she experienced chest pain while her niece, Carrie Danziger, was visiting. After trying to hide her discomfort and phoning a neighbor about her concern, she ultimately went to a hospital, where she was diagnosed as having suffered a heart attack. She remained in the hospital and died from complications of the heart attack at St. Luke&#x27;s Hospital in Manhattan on July 8, 2004.

Following a memorial service at Riverside Memorial Chapel in New York City, Paula was buried in the Woodstock Artists Cemetery in Woodstock, New York. She was survived by her brother Barry, her niece Carrie, and three nephews.

== Writing career ==
Danziger&#x27;s debut novel was &quot;The Cat Ate My Gymsuit&quot;, whose characters were largely based on her childhood experiences. She continued writing books for teens through the 1980s, expanding to books for younger readers with the Amber Brown series, whose protagonist is based on Danziger&#x27;s niece Carrie. She frequently gave lectures and speeches, wearing elaborate costumes and calling herself a children&#x27;s Dame Edna Everage. She is quoted as saying that her alternative career choice would have been to be a comedian.

She collaborated with Ann M. Martin twice, with &quot;P.S. Longer Letter Later&quot; (1998) and &quot;Snail Mail No More&quot; (2000). The two would send correspondence to each other as if they were the main characters.

Paula Danziger and her fellow author Bruce Coville read their work to each other over the phone beginning in 1992, continuing for over a decade as a two-person writers&#x27; group and later including author Elizabeth Levy. Following Danziger&#x27;s passing, Coville and Levy continued her &quot;Amber Brown&quot; series, beginning with &quot;Amber Brown is Tickled Pink&quot; (2012), which told the story of the remarriage of the title character&#x27;s mother.

==Awards==
Paula Danziger&#x27;s works were nominated for and won many US state-level children&#x27;s book awards, including the Massachusetts Children&#x27;s Book Award for &quot;The Cat Ate My Gymsuit&quot; in 1979 and the California Young Reader Medal for &quot;There&#x27;s a Bat in Bunk Five&quot; in 1984. Four of her works were named IRA-CBC Children&#x27;s Choices: &quot;The Pistachio Prescription&quot; in 1979, &quot;The Cat Ate My Gymsuit&quot; and &quot;Can You Sue Your Parents for Malpractice?&quot; in 1980, and &quot;There&#x27;s a Bat in Bunk Five&quot; in 1981. 

The Society of Children&#x27;s Book Writers and Illustrators awards the Amber Brown Grant, which provides an all-expenses-paid, full-day visit by a well-respected children&#x27;s author or illustrator, a stipend to assist in creating the event, and $250 worth of books by the visiting author, to one or two schools annually in her honor.
