<text>In fluid mechanics, hydrostatic equilibrium (hydrostatic balance, hydrostasy) is the condition of a fluid or plastic solid at rest, which occurs when external forces, such as gravity, are balanced by a pressure-gradient force. In the planetary physics of Earth, the pressure-gradient force prevents gravity from collapsing the planetary atmosphere into a thin, dense shell, whereas gravity prevents the pressure-gradient force from diffusing the atmosphere into outer space. In general, it is what causes objects in space to be spherical.

Hydrostatic equilibrium is the distinguishing criterion between dwarf planets and small solar system bodies, and features in astrophysics and planetary geology. Said qualification of equilibrium indicates that the shape of the object is symmetrically rounded, mostly due to rotation, into an ellipsoid, where any irregular surface features are consequent to a relatively thin solid crust. In addition to the Sun, there are a dozen or so equilibrium objects confirmed to exist in the Solar System.

== Mathematical consideration ==
For a hydrostatic fluid on Earth:
formula_1

=== Derivation from force summation ===

Newton&#x27;s laws of motion state that a volume of a fluid that is not in motion or that is in a state of constant velocity must have zero net force on it. This means the sum of the forces in a given direction must be opposed by an equal sum of forces in the opposite direction. This force balance is called a hydrostatic equilibrium.

The fluid can be split into a large number of cuboid volume elements; by considering a single element, the action of the fluid can be derived.

There are three forces: the force downwards onto the top of the cuboid from the pressure, &quot;P&quot;, of the fluid above it is, from the definition of pressure,
formula_2
Similarly, the force on the volume element from the pressure of the fluid below pushing upwards is
formula_3

Finally, the weight of the volume element causes a force downwards. If the density is &quot;ρ&quot;, the volume is &quot;V&quot; and &quot;g&quot; the standard gravity, then:
formula_4
The volume of this cuboid is equal to the area of the top or bottom, times the height – the formula for finding the volume of a cube.
formula_5

By balancing these forces, the total force on the fluid is
formula_6
This sum equals zero if the fluid&#x27;s velocity is constant. Dividing by A,
formula_7
Or,
formula_8
&quot;P&quot;top − &quot;P&quot;bottom is a change in pressure, and &quot;h&quot; is the height of the volume element—a change in the distance above the ground. By saying these changes are infinitesimally small, the equation can be written in differential form.
formula_9
Density changes with pressure, and gravity changes with height, so the equation would be:
formula_1

=== Derivation from Navier–Stokes equations ===
Note finally that this last equation can be derived by solving the three-dimensional Navier–Stokes equations for the equilibrium situation where
formula_11
Then the only non-trivial equation is the formula_12-equation, which now reads
formula_13
Thus, hydrostatic balance can be regarded as a particularly simple equilibrium solution of the Navier–Stokes equations.

=== Derivation from general relativity ===
By plugging the energy–momentum tensor for a perfect fluid
formula_14
into the Einstein field equations
formula_15
and using the conservation condition
formula_16
one can derive the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff equation for the structure of a static, spherically symmetric relativistic star in isotropic coordinates:
formula_17
In practice, &quot;Ρ&quot; and &quot;ρ&quot; are related by an equation of state of the form &quot;f&quot;(&quot;Ρ&quot;,&quot;ρ&quot;) = 0, with &quot;f&quot; specific to makeup of the star. &quot;M&quot;(&quot;r&quot;) is a foliation of spheres weighted by the mass density &quot;ρ&quot;(&quot;r&quot;), with the largest sphere having radius &quot;r&quot;:
formula_18
Per standard procedure in taking the nonrelativistic limit, we let , so that the factor
formula_19
Therefore, in the nonrelativistic limit the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff equation reduces to Newton&#x27;s hydrostatic equilibrium:
formula_20
(we have made the trivial notation change &quot;h&quot; = &quot;r&quot; and have used &quot;f&quot;(&quot;Ρ&quot;,&quot;ρ&quot;) = 0 to express &quot;ρ&quot; in terms of &quot;P&quot;). A similar equation can be computed for rotating, axially symmetric stars, which in its gauge independent form reads:
formula_21 
Unlike the TOV equilibrium equation, these are two equations (for instance, if as usual when treating stars, one chooses spherical coordinates as basis coordinates formula_22, the index &quot;i&quot; runs for the coordinates &quot;r&quot; and formula_23).

== Applications ==

=== Fluids ===
The hydrostatic equilibrium pertains to hydrostatics and the principles of equilibrium of fluids. A hydrostatic balance is a particular balance for weighing substances in water. Hydrostatic balance allows the discovery of their specific gravities. This equilibrium is strictly applicable when an ideal fluid is in steady horizontal laminar flow, and when any fluid is at rest or in vertical motion at constant speed. It can also be a satisfactory approximation when flow speeds are low enough that acceleration is negligible.

=== Astrophysics and planetary science ===
From the time of Isaac Newton much work has been done on the subject of the equilibrium attained when a fluid rotates in space. This has application to both stars and objects like planets, which may have been fluid in the past or in which the solid material deforms like a fluid when subjected to very high stresses.

In any given layer of a star, there is a hydrostatic equilibrium between the outward-pushing pressure gradient and the weight of the material above pressing inward. One can also study planets under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium. A rotating star or planet in hydrostatic equilibrium is usually an oblate spheroid, an ellipsoid in which two of the principal axes are equal and longer than the third.

An example of this phenomenon is the star Vega, which has a rotation period of 12.5 hours. Consequently, Vega is about 20% larger at the equator than from pole to pole.

In his 1687 &quot;Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica&quot; Newton correctly stated that a rotating fluid of uniform density under the influence of gravity would take the form of a spheroid and that the gravity (including the effect of centrifugal force) would be weaker at the equator than at the poles by an amount equal (at least asymptotically) to five fourths the centrifugal force at the equator. In 1742, Colin Maclaurin published his treatise on fluxions in which he showed that the spheroid was an exact solution. If we designate the equatorial radius by formula_24 the polar radius by formula_25 and the eccentricity by formula_26 with
: formula_27
he found that the gravity at the poles is
: formula_28
where formula_29 is the gravitational constant, formula_30 is the (uniform) density, and formula_31 is the total mass. The ratio of this to formula_32 the gravity if the fluid is not rotating, is asymptotic to
: formula_33
as formula_34 goes to zero, where formula_35 is the flattening:
: formula_36

The gravitational attraction on the equator (not including centrifugal force) is
: formula_37

Asymptotically, we have:
: formula_38

Maclaurin showed (still in the case of uniform density) that the component of gravity toward the axis of rotation depended only on the distance from the axis and was proportional to that distance, and the component in the direction toward the plane of the equator depended only on the distance from that plane and was proportional to that distance. Newton had already pointed out that the gravity felt on the equator (including the lightening due to centrifugal force) has to be formula_39 in order to have the same pressure at the bottom of channels from the pole or from the equator to the centre, so the centrifugal force at the equator must be
: formula_40

Defining the latitude to be the angle between a tangent to the meridian and axis of rotation, the total gravity felt at latitude formula_41 (including the effect of centrifugal force) is
: formula_42

This spheroid solution is stable up to a certain (critical) angular momentum (normalized by formula_43), but in 1834, Carl Jacobi showed that it becomes unstable once the eccentricity reaches 0.81267 (or formula_35 reaches 0.3302).
Above the critical value, the solution becomes a Jacobi, or scalene, ellipsoid (one with all three axes different). Henri Poincaré in 1885 found that at still higher angular momentum it will no longer be ellipsoidal but or oviform. The symmetry drops from the 8-fold D point group to the 4-fold C, with its axis perpendicular to the axis of rotation. Other shapes satisfy the equations beyond that, but are not stable, at least not near the point of bifurcation. Poincaré was unsure what would happen at higher angular momentum but concluded that eventually the blob would split into two.

The assumption of uniform density may apply more or less to a molten planet or a rocky planet but does not apply to a star or to a planet like the earth which has a dense metallic core. In 1737, Alexis Clairaut studied the case of density varying with depth. Clairaut&#x27;s theorem states that the variation of the gravity (including centrifugal force) is proportional to the square of the sine of the latitude, with the proportionality depending linearly on the flattening (formula_35) and the ratio at the equator of centrifugal force to gravitational attraction. (Compare with the exact relation above for the case of uniform density.) Clairaut&#x27;s theorem is a special case for an oblate spheroid of a connexion found later by Pierre-Simon Laplace between the shape and the variation of gravity.

If the star has a massive nearby companion object, tidal forces come into play as well, which distort the star into a scalene shape if rotation alone would make it a spheroid. An example of this is Beta Lyrae.

Hydrostatic equilibrium is also important for the intracluster medium, where it restricts the amount of fluid that can be present in the core of a cluster of galaxies.

We can also use the principle of hydrostatic equilibrium to estimate the velocity dispersion of dark matter in clusters of galaxies. Only baryonic matter (or, rather, the collisions thereof) emits X-ray radiation. The absolute X-ray luminosity per unit volume takes the form formula_46 where formula_47 and formula_48 are the temperature and density of the baryonic matter, and formula_49 is some function of temperature and fundamental constants. The baryonic density satisfies the above equation 
formula_50
The integral is a measure of the total mass of the cluster, with formula_51 being the proper distance to the center of the cluster. Using the ideal gas law formula_52 (formula_53 is the Boltzmann constant and formula_54 is a characteristic mass of the baryonic gas particles) and rearranging, we arrive at
formula_55
Multiplying by formula_56 and differentiating with respect to formula_51 yields
formula_58
If we make the assumption that cold dark matter particles have an isotropic velocity distribution, the same derivation applies to these particles, and their density formula_59 satisfies the non-linear differential equation
formula_60
With perfect X-ray and distance data, we could calculate the baryon density at each point in the cluster and thus the dark matter density. We could then calculate the velocity dispersion formula_61 of the dark matter, which is given by 
formula_62 
The central density ratio formula_63 is dependent on the redshift formula_12 of the cluster and is given by
formula_65 
where formula_23 is the angular width of the cluster and formula_67 the proper distance to the cluster. Values for the ratio range from 0.11 to 0.14 for various surveys.

=== Planetary geology ===

The concept of hydrostatic equilibrium has also become important in determining whether an astronomical object is a planet, dwarf planet, or small Solar System body. According to the definition of planet that was adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 2006, one defining characteristic of planets and dwarf planets is that they are objects that have sufficient gravity to overcome their own rigidity and assume hydrostatic equilibrium. Such a body often has the differentiated interior and geology of a world (a planemo), but near-hydrostatic or formerly hydrostatic bodies such as the proto-planet 4 Vesta may also be differentiated and some hydrostatic bodies (notably Callisto) have not thoroughly differentiated since their formation. Often, the equilibrium shape is an oblate spheroid, as is the case with Earth. However, in the cases of moons in synchronous orbit, nearly unidirectional tidal forces create a scalene ellipsoid. Also, the purported dwarf planet is scalene because of its rapid rotation though it may not currently be in equilibrium.

Icy objects were previously believed to need less mass to attain hydrostatic equilibrium than rocky objects. The smallest object that appears to have an equilibrium shape is the icy moon Mimas at 396 km, but the largest icy object known to have an obviously non-equilibrium shape is the icy moon Proteus at 420 km, and the largest rocky bodies in an obviously non-equilibrium shape are the asteroids Pallas and Vesta at about 520 km. However, Mimas is not actually in hydrostatic equilibrium for its current rotation. The smallest body confirmed to be in hydrostatic equilibrium is the dwarf planet Ceres, which is icy, at 945 km, and the largest known body to have a noticeable deviation from hydrostatic equilibrium is Iapetus being made of mostly permeable ice and almost no rock. At 1,469 km Iapetus is neither spherical nor ellipsoid. Instead, it is rather in a strange walnut-like shape due to its unique equatorial ridge. Some icy bodies may be in equilibrium at least partly due to a subsurface ocean, which is not the definition of equilibrium used by the IAU (gravity overcoming internal rigid-body forces). Even larger bodies deviate from hydrostatic equilibrium, although they are ellipsoidal: examples are Earth&#x27;s Moon at 3,474 km (mostly rock), and the planet Mercury at 4,880 km (mostly metal).

In 2024, Kiss et al. found that has an ellipsoidal shape incompatible with hydrostatic equilibrium for its current spin. They hypothesised that Quaoar originally had a rapid rotation and was in hydrostatic equilibrium but that its shape became &quot;frozen in&quot; and did not change as it spun down because of tidal forces from its moon Weywot. If so, this would resemble the situation of Iapetus, which is too oblate for its current spin. Iapetus is generally still considered a planetary-mass moon nonetheless though not always.

Solid bodies have irregular surfaces, but local irregularities may be consistent with global equilibrium. For example, the massive base of the tallest mountain on Earth, Mauna Kea, has deformed and depressed the level of the surrounding crust and so the overall distribution of mass approaches equilibrium.

=== Atmospheric modeling ===

In the atmosphere, the pressure of the air decreases with increasing altitude. This pressure difference causes an upward force called the pressure-gradient force. The force of gravity balances this out, keeps the atmosphere bound to Earth and maintains pressure differences with altitude.

<text>The Fleet Air Arm (FAA) is the naval aviation component of the United Kingdom&#x27;s Royal Navy (RN). The FAA is one of five RN fighting arms. it is a primarily helicopter force, though also operating the F-35 Lightning II carrier-based stealth fighter jointly with the Royal Air Force. 

The RAF was formed by the 1918 merger of the RN&#x27;s Royal Naval Air Service with the British Army&#x27;s Royal Flying Corps. The FAA did not come under the direct control of the Admiralty until mid-1939. During the Second World War, the FAA operated aircraft on ships as well as land-based aircraft that defended the Royal Navy&#x27;s shore establishments and facilities.

==History==

===Beginnings===
British naval flying started in 1909, with the construction of an airship for naval duties. In 1911 the Royal Navy graduated its first aeroplane pilots at the Royal Aero Club flying ground near Eastchurch, Isle of Sheppey under the tutelage of pioneer aviator George Bertram Cockburn. In May 1912, naval and army aviation were combined to become the Royal Flying Corps (RFC). The Naval Wing of the RFC lasted until July 1914 when the Royal Navy reformed its air branch, under the Air Department of the Admiralty, naming it the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS). By the outbreak of the First World War, in August 1914, the RNAS had more aircraft under its control than the remaining RFC. The roles of the RNAS were fleet reconnaissance, patrolling coasts for enemy ships and submarines, attacking enemy coastal territory and defending Britain from enemy air raids, along with deployment along the Western Front. In April 1918 the RNAS, which at this time had 67,000 officers and men, 2,949 aircraft, 103 airships and 126 coastal stations, merged with the RFC to form the Royal Air Force.

===Fleet Air Arm===
On 1 April 1924, the Fleet Air Arm of the Royal Air Force was formed, encompassing those RAF units that normally embarked on aircraft carriers and fighting ships. The year was significant for British naval aviation as only weeks before the founding of the Fleet Air Arm, the Royal Navy had commissioned , the world&#x27;s first ship to be designed and built as an aircraft carrier. Over the following months RAF Fleet Air Arm Fairey IIID reconnaissance biplanes operated off Hermes, conducting flying trials.

On 24 May 1939 the Fleet Air Arm was returned to Admiralty control under the &quot;Inskip Award&quot; (named after the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence overseeing the British re-armament programme) and renamed the Air Branch of the Royal Navy. At the onset of the Second World War, the Fleet Air Arm consisted of 20 squadrons with only 232 frontline aircraft, and 191 additional trainers. By the end of the war the strength of the Fleet Air Arm was 59 aircraft carriers, 3,700 aircraft, 72,000 officers and men and 56 Naval air stations.

During the war, the FAA operated fighters, torpedo bombers and reconnaissance aircraft. Following the Dunkirk evacuation and the commencement of the Battle of Britain, the Royal Air Force soon found itself critically short of fighter pilots. In the summer of 1940, the RAF had just over 800 fighter pilots and as personnel shortages worsened; the RAF turned to the Admiralty to ask for help from the Fleet Air Arm. Fleet Air Arm crews under RAF Fighter Command were either seconded individually to RAF fighter squadrons or entire as with 804 and 808 Naval Air Squadrons. The former provided dockyard defence during the Battle of Britain with Sea Gladiators.

In British home waters and out into the Atlantic Ocean, operations against Axis shipping and submarines in support of the RN were mounted by RAF Coastal Command with large patrol bombers, flying boats and land-based fighter-bombers. The aircraft carrier had replaced the battleship as the capital ship of the RN and its aircraft were now its principal offensive weapons. The top scoring fighter ace with 17 victories was Commander Stanley Orr, the Royal Marine ace was Ronald Cuthbert Hay with 13 victories. A number of Royal Marines were FAA pilots during the war.

Notable Fleet Air Arm operations during the war included the Battle of Taranto, the sinking of the &quot;Bismarck&quot;, the attempt to prevent the Channel Dash, Operation Tungsten against the &quot;Tirpitz&quot; and Operation Meridian against oil plants in Sumatra.

===Post-war history===

After the war the FAA needed to fly jet aircraft from their carriers. The jet aircraft of the era were considerably less effective at low speeds than propeller aircraft, but propeller aircraft could not effectively fight jets at the high speeds flown by jet aircraft. The FAA took on its first jet, the Sea Vampire, in the late 1940s. The Sea Vampire was the first jet credited with taking off and landing on a carrier. The Air Arm continued with high-powered prop aircraft alongside the new jets resulting in the FAA being woefully outpowered during the Korean War. Nevertheless, jets were not yet wholly superior to propeller aircraft and a flight of ground attack Hawker Sea Furies downed a MiG-15 and damaged others in an engagement.

As jets became larger, more powerful and faster they required more space to take off and land. The US Navy simply built much larger carriers. The Royal Navy had a few large carriers built and completed after the end of the war but another solution was sought. This was partly overcome by the introduction of a Royal Navy idea to angle the flight deck away from the centre line so that the aircraft landing had a clear run away from the usual forward deck park. An associated British invention, intended to provide more precise optical guidance to aircraft on final approaching the deck, was the Fresnel lens optical landing aid. Another Royal Navy invention was the use of a steam-powered catapult to cater for the larger and heavier aircraft (both systems were adopted by the US Navy).

Defence cuts across the British armed forces during the 1960s and 1970s led to the withdrawal of existing Royal Navy aircraft carriers, transfer of Fleet Air Arm fixed-wing jet strike aircraft such as the F-4K (FG.1) Phantom II and Buccaneer S.2 to the Royal Air Force, and cancellation of large replacement aircraft carriers, including the CVA-01 design. The last conventional carrier to be retired was in 1978. When HMS &quot;Hermes&quot; was converted in 1980/81 to a STOVL carrier to operate Sea Harriers, a &#x27;Ski-jump ramp&#x27; was fitted to aid take-off. A new series of small carriers, the anti-submarine warfare ships (known as &quot;through deck cruisers&quot;) were built and equipped with the Sea Harrier a derivative of the Hawker Siddeley Harrier VTOL aircraft. These carriers incorporated an upswept forward section of the flight deck that deflected the aircraft upward on launch and permitted heavier loads to be carried by the Harrier, for example in weaponry, and the system was used extensively in the Falklands War, with both &quot;Hermes&quot; and &quot;Invincible&quot; part of the Task Force.
At the end of the Cold War in 1989 the Fleet Air Arm was under the command of the Flag Officer Naval Air Command, a rear admiral based at RNAS Yeovilton.

===Post Cold War===
In 2000 the Sea Harrier force was merged with the RAF&#x27;s Harrier GR7 fleet to form Joint Force Harrier. The Fleet Air Arm began withdrawing the Sea Harrier from service in 2004 with the disbandment of 800 NAS. 801 NAS disbanded on 28 March 2006 at RNAS Yeovilton (HMS &quot;Heron&quot;). 800 and 801 NAS were then combined to form the Naval Strike Wing, flying ex-RAF Harrier GR7 and GR9s. On 1 April 2010, NSW reverted to the identity of 800 Naval Air Squadron. The Harrier GR7 and GR9 retired from service in December 2010 following the Strategic Defence and Security Review 2010.

Two new carriers able to operate the F-35B short take-off and landing variant of the US Lockheed Martin Lightning II aircraft were constructed. In the Strategic Defence and Security Review 2015, it was announced that the carriers would enter service &quot;from 2018&quot;. The procurement plan is for a force of 138 F-35 aircraft, which are intended to be operated by both the RAF and FAA from a common pool, in the same manner as the Joint Force Harrier. With the introduction of the F-35, the Fleet Air Arm will return to the operation of fixed-wing strike aircraft at sea. In 2013, an initial cadre of Royal Air Force and Royal Navy pilots and aircraft maintenance personnel were assigned to the U.S. Marine Corps&#x27; Marine Fighter Attack Training Squadron 501 (VMFAT-501), part of the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s 33rd Fighter Wing at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, for training on the F-35B. 809 Naval Air Squadron will be the first FAA unit to operate the F-35B and will be based at RAF Marham.

====Helicopters====
Helicopters also became important combat platforms since the Second World War. Initially used in the search and rescue role, they were later developed for anti-submarine warfare and troop transport; during the 1956 Suez Crisis they were used to land Royal Marine Commando forces, the first time this had ever been done in combat. Originally operated only from carriers, the development of the Westland Wasp in the 1960s allowed helicopters to operate on all ships of frigate size or larger. Wasps, Sea Kings and Wessex helicopters all played an active part in the 1982 Falklands War, while Lynx helicopters played an attack role against Iraqi patrol boats in the 1991 Gulf War and Commando Sea King HC4s as well as the Lynx HMA Mk 8 from HMS &quot;Argyll&quot;, assisted in suppressing rebel forces in the British intervention in the Sierra Leone Civil War in 2000.

====Museums====
The Fleet Air Arm has a museum near RNAS Yeovilton (HMS &quot;Heron&quot;) in Somerset, England, at which many of the great historical aircraft flown by the Service are on display, along with aircraft from other sources. There is also a Fleet Air Arm museum inside the Museum of Transport &amp; Technology in Auckland, New Zealand. On display there is a full-size replica Fairey Swordfish, along with historic items and memorabilia.

==The FAA today==

===Personnel===
In 1938, Admiralty Fleet Orders 2885 announced the formation of an Air Branch of the Royal Naval Reserve. Thirty three unmarried men signed up for eighteen months full-time flying training; however, before these first volunteers were able to gain their wings Britain was at war. At the end of hostilities in 1945 the RNVR(A) was 46,000 strong, with over 8,000 aircrew. Post war the RNVR(A) comprised 12 dedicated reserve squadrons, grouped regionally into Air Divisions. However, defence cuts in 1957 disbanded the five Air Divisions, and the following year the RNVR was merged with the RNR.

====Today====
As of 1 December 2013, the Regular Fleet Air Arm has a reported strength of 5,000 personnel, which represents approximately 20% of the Royal Navy&#x27;s total strength (excluding Royal Marines).

The Assistant Chief of the Naval Staff (Aviation &amp; Carriers), the professional head (and also Rear Admiral Fleet Air Arm), is Rear Admiral Martin Connell as of February 2019. Under First Sea Lord Admiral Tony Radakin’s plans, the professional head of the Fleet Air Arm is set to shortly change to a one-star role, headed by a Commodore.

Members of the Fleet Air Arm continue to be known as WAFUs. WAFU (&quot;wet and f**king useless&quot;) is said to actually derive from &quot;Weapon and Fuel Users&quot;, a stores category for clothing.

====Reserve Air Branch====
The RNR Air Branch was commissioned at RNAS Yeovilton on 16 July 1980, and shortly afterwards 38 ex-regular aircrew began refresher training. Today the RNR Air Branch comprises approximately 250 ex-regular service Officers and Ratings, covering all aviation trades, tasked to support the Fleet Air Arm.

The Air Branch has its roots in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve Air Branch, whose members served with distinction between 1937 through the Second World War until 1950 when it was disbanded. Formed on 3 April 1980, the Air Branch was initially established to provide additional Pilots and Observers to the Royal Navy, but later expanded to include all trades and specialisations of the Fleet Air Arm. Currently comprising some 320 personnel, HMS Pegasus is one of the biggest Units in the Royal Naval Reserve.

The name HMS Pegasus has a long and interesting history in the Royal Navy, dating back to 1585. The second HMS Pegasus was commanded by Prince William Henry, who later became King William IV, known as the Sailor King. In late 1786, the third HMS Pegasus was stationed in the West Indies under then Captain Horatio Nelson, earning three of her four Battle Honours. The fourth and last HMS Pegasus served as a prototype fighter catapult ship, originally commissioned as HMS Ark Royal, serving primarily on convoy duty in the Second World War. 

The name Pegasus has associations outside of the Royal Navy, including the Bristol Aeroplane Company engine that powered the Fairey Swordfish and the Rolls Royce engine that powered the BAE Sea Harrier. And, of course, the Parachute Regiment use Pegasus as their emblem.

===Insignia===



The FAA is known for its use of the &#x27;Fleet Air Arm Zig Zag&#x27;: a light blue zig zag on a dark blue background.

The pattern is thought to have belonged to the &quot;Perch Club&quot;, membership of which was restricted to those who had completed 100 deck landings without an accident. The zig zag was thought to have been taken from a Creeping Line Ahead, a parallel search pattern performed by FAA aircraft in a carrier task group.

Today, the dark blue background represents the Royal Navy; the colour of the zigzag represents the Royal Flying Corps, from which the Royal Naval Air Service was born; and the zigzag shape represents a nod to the Royal Artillery (red zigzag on blue background), given that the first people sent aloft in tethered balloons to spot the fall of shot were Royal Artillery observers. It was these observers who became early members of the Royal Flying Corps.

Aircrew wear flying badges, such as pilots wearing a pair of gold albatross wings. The wings badges also feature a crown and fouled anchor in the centre, to reflect the maritime element of the flying undertaken. Wings are worn on the left sleeve of naval aviators, unlike their other service counterparts.

==Aircraft==
The FAA operates fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft. It uses the same aircraft designation system as the RAF.

===Fixed wing===

====F-35B Lightning II====
The introduction of the F-35B Lightning II saw a restoration of fixed wing, front-line operations to the FAA after the retirement of Joint Force Harrier in 2010. The Lightning Force is a joint RAF-Fleet Air Arm formation with all F-35Bs capable of operating from the Royal Navy&#x27;s Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers. The first Fleet Air Arm squadron to operate the F-35B is 809 Naval Air Squadron which formally stood-up in December 2023, joining other F-35B squadrons within the RAF that are formally part of No. 1 Group RAF.

An initial order of 48 airframes was made in 2012 to equip the air wings of the two &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;-class aircraft carriers, with the operation split between the FAA and the Royal Air Force, as was the case with Joint Force Harrier. 809 Naval Air Squadron was announced as the second UK unit to fly the F-35B (the first being 617 Squadron RAF) and is the first FAA unit to operate the aircraft. It is understood that at least two further frontline squadrons will stand up in the future alongside 809, 617, 17(R) Test and Evaluation Squadron and an RAF-numbered Operational Conversion Unit, creating a total of six squadrons including the OCU and OEU. Under the Strategic Defence and Security Review of November 2015, the UK Government made a commitment to buying 138 F-35B, with at least 24 available for carrier use by 2023. Subsequently, following on the 2021 defence review, the First Sea Lord indicated that the new envisaged number was to be 60 aircraft initially and &quot;then maybe more&quot;, up to a maximum of around 80 to hopefully equip four &quot;deployable squadrons&quot;. In April 2022, the Deputy Chief of Defence Staff, Air Marshal Richard Knighton, told the House of Commons Defence Select Committee that the MoD was in discussions to purchase a second tranche of 26 F-35B fighters. Plans for frontline F-35B squadrons had been modified and now envisaged a total of three squadrons (rather than four) each deploying 12-16 aircraft. In surge conditions 24 F-35s might be deployed on the Queen Elizabeth-class carriers but a routine deployment would likely involve 12 aircraft.

In January 2019, initial operating capability for the UK&#x27;s F-35B was announced with 18 F-35Bs jointly delivered to the UK. As of December 2022, 26 aircraft were operational in the UK and were based at RAF Marham. These aircraft regularly deployed for operations on the &quot;Queen Elizabeth-class&quot; aircraft carriers. Another 3 F-35s remained in the US for testing and evaluation purposes.

While 33 F-35B aircraft (including 3 or 4 based in the U.S.) were in the U.K. inventory by March 2024, former U.K. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace reported that the RAF and Royal Navy faced a considerable challenge in providing even the existing modest F-35B fleet with qualified pilots. As of late 2022 there were only 30 qualified British pilots (plus three exchange pilots from the United States and Australia) for the F-35. The average wait time for RAF trainee Typhoon and F-35 pilots, after completing the Military Flying Training System, was approximately 11 and 12 months respectively. A further gap of 68 weeks existed between completing Basic Flying Training and beginning Advanced Fast Jet Training. The resulting pilot shortage was a factor in delaying the ability to stand up the first Fleet Air Arm Squadron (809 Squadron) on a timely basis. In February 2023, the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Sir Mike Wigston, reported that the number of F-35 pilots had grown to 34 UK pilots with a further 7 to complete training by August 2023.

====Training====
Four types of fixed wing aircraft are operated by the FAA for training purposes: Pilot Grading is carried out using the Grob Tutor T1. Elementary flying training is then conducted on the Grob Prefect T1. From there, pilots are streamed to either Rotary or Fast-Jet.

Observer grading and training is done using four Beechcraft Avenger T1 before observers join their frontline aircraft.

===Rotary===
Today the largest section of the FAA is the rotary wing section. Pilots designated for rotary wing service train under No. 1 Flying Training School at RAF Shawbury. The school is a tri-Service organisation consisting of civilian and military instructors (including Naval instructors and a Naval Air Squadron) that take the student from basic flying through to more advanced flying such as instrument flying, navigation, formation and captaincy.

Its aviators fly one of four types of helicopters:

====Commando Merlin====

The HC4/4A AW101 Merlin (nicknamed &quot;Junglie Merlin&quot;) serves as a medium lifter and troop transporter in support of the Royal Marines. The FAA received the Merlin HC3/HC3A fleet from the RAF, replacing the Commando Sea King in September 2014. These have been marinised and replaced with HC4s/HC4As, under the Merlin Life Sustainment Programme (MLSP) that was placed on contract in December 2013.

====Commando Wildcat AH1====

The AW159 Wildcat: the BRH (Battlefield Reconnaissance Helicopter) replaces the Westland Lynx as the Battlefield Reconnaissance Helicopter of the FAA. Along with the Commando Merlin, these squadrons operate under Commando Helicopter Force, which provides airborne support to UK Commando Force of the Royal Marines.

====Wildcat HMA2====

The Wildcat HMA2 became the standard small ship borne helicopter in the FAA, with 28 Wildcats replacing the Lynx HMA8 in 2017. Twenty-eight AW159 Wildcat HMA2 helicopters perform a range of roles including anti-surface and anti-submarine warfare and airborne surveillance.

====Merlin HM2====

The Merlin HM2 (&quot;Grey Merlin&quot;) is the FAA&#x27;s primary anti-submarine warfare (ASW) helicopter, having replaced the Sea King HAS6 in the role. It is presently deployed with various ships of the Royal Navy. 

Merlin HM2 also incorporates an airborne early warning and surveillance (AEW) variant, known as Crowsnest, which replaced the ASaC7 variant of the Sea King. The first Merlin HM2 test flight with Crowsnest was completed in April 2019. However, initial operating capability of the system was significantly delayed. While Crowsnest was deployed with the U.K. carrier strike group in 2021, it experienced operating challenges and finally achieved initial operating capability in July 2023. Full operating capability is expected in 2024/25. While all Merlins in the Royal Navy will be equipped to operate Crowsnest, only ten kits for the system are being acquired. It has been reported that initially five Merlins will be equipped with Crowsnest, three of these being normally assigned to the &quot;high readiness&quot; aircraft carrier. Challenges involved in the Crowsnest program have led the Royal Navy to seek a replacement for its helicopter-based AEW platform with a new fixed-wing UAV, under Project Vixen, by 2030.

===Unmanned===
As of 2024, the Royal Navy operated a number of small UAVs, including the AeroVironment Puma AE and Ebee Vision. In 2024, the Navy reported that there were a total of nine qualified Puma teams, six of which were dedicated to supporting the Royal Marines in 40 and 45 Commando. 

The FAA&#x27;s inventory was further boosted with the addition of the Peregrine rotary-wing UAV which started trials on HMS Lancaster in August 2024.

===Future===
A number of unmanned systems are under development for the Fleet Air Arm including fixed-wing UAVs, envisaged for potential operation from the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;-class carriers. These programs are in the conceptual or planning stages under a program known as Project Vixen.

===Squadrons and flights===
A Fleet Air Arm flying squadron is formally titled Naval Air Squadron (NAS), a title used as a suffix to the squadron number. The FAA assigns numbers in the 700–799 range to training and operational conversion squadrons and numbers in the 800–899 range to operational squadrons. Exceptions to the 700–799 include operational conversion squadrons which also hold some form of operational commitment where they are then titled 800–899. During WWII the 1700 and 1800 ranges were also used for operational squadrons.

An additional flying unit of the Royal Navy is the FOST Helicopter Support Unit based at HMS &quot;Raleigh&quot; in Cornwall. This unit is not part of the Fleet Air Arm, but is directly under the control of Fleet Operational Sea Training, operated by British International Helicopters (BIH). BIH also support various Royal Navy and NATO exercises with passenger and freight transfer services and transfers by hoist, for ships exercising both in the Atlantic and the North Sea.

The Royal Navy share both operational and training duties on the Lightning II with the RAF under a banner organisation called the Lightning Force, which will operate in the same manner as Joint Force Harrier.

Until March 2019, the Fleet Air Arm had responsibility for the Royal Navy Historic Flight, a heritage unit of airworthy aircraft representing the history of aviation in the Royal Navy. The Historic Flight was disbanded on 31 March 2019, with responsibility for maintaining and operating the aircraft transferred to Navy Wings, a charitable body that also runs the Fly Navy Heritage Trust.

<doc id="51778" wikidata="Q37087" url="?curid=51778" title="Church of Satan">
<text>The Church of Satan (CoS) is a religious organization dedicated to the religion of Satanism as defined by Anton Szandor LaVey. Founded in San Francisco in 1966, by LaVey, it is considered the &quot;oldest satanic religion in continual existence&quot;, and more importantly the most influential, inspiring &quot;numerous imitator and breakaway groups&quot;. According to the Church, Satanism has been &quot;codified&quot; as &quot;a religion and philosophy&quot; by LaVey and his church. Founded in an era when there was much public interest in the occult, witchcraft and Satanism, the church enjoyed a heyday for several years after its founding. Celebrities attended LaVey&#x27;s satanic parties and he was invited on talk shows. His &quot;Satanic Bible&quot; sold nearly a million copies.

LaVey was the church&#x27;s until his death in 1997. In 2001, Peter H. Gilmore was appointed to the position of high priest, and the church&#x27;s headquarters were moved to Hell&#x27;s Kitchen, Manhattan, New York City. Members do not believe that Satan literally exists and do not worship him. Instead, Satan is viewed as a positive archetype embracing the Hebrew root of the word &quot;Satan&quot; as &quot;adversary&quot;, who represents pride, , and enlightenment, humanity&#x27;s natural instincts which Abrahamic faiths have wrongly suppressed. According to High Priest Peter H. Gilmore, Satan is &quot;a name for the reservoir of power inside each human to be tapped at will&quot;
. In LaVey&#x27;s book, &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot;, the Satanist&#x27;s concept of a God is described as the Satanist&#x27;s true &quot;self&quot;— a projection of his or her own personality, not an external deity. Satan is used as a representation of personal liberty and individualism.

The Church dismisses the idea of a “Satanic Community” and does not share membership lists with its members, arguing members are &quot;radical individualists&quot; who &quot;may share very little in common beyond&quot; being Satanists. The Church rejects the legitimacy of any other organizations who claim to be Satanists. Scholars agree that there is no reliably documented case of Satanic continuity prior to the founding of the Church of Satan. It was the first organized church in modern times to be devoted to the figure of Satan, and according to Faxneld and Petersen, the Church represented &quot;the first public, highly visible, and long-lasting organization which propounded a coherent satanic discourse&quot;.

==Beliefs==

LaVey described his religion as &quot;just Ayn Rand&#x27;s philosophy with ceremony and ritual added&quot;; similarly, sociologist of religion James R. Lewis described it as &quot;a blend of Epicureanism and Ayn Rand&#x27;s philosophy, flavored with a pinch of ritual magic.&quot; There is no belief in or worship of the Devil or a Christian notion of Satan. High priest Peter Gilmore describes its members as &quot;skeptical atheists&quot;, indicating the Hebrew root of the word &quot;Satan&quot; as &quot;adversary&quot; or &quot;opposer.&quot; Gilmore rejects the legitimacy of theistic Satanists, who believe Satan to be a supernatural being or force that may be contacted or supplicated to, dubbing them &quot;devil worshipers&quot;. In an interview with David Shankbone, High Priest Peter Gilmore stated &quot;My real feeling is that anybody who believes in supernatural entities on some level is insane. Whether they believe in the Devil or God, they are abdicating reason.&quot; He added, &quot;Satanism begins with atheism. We begin with the universe and say, &#x27;It’s indifferent. There’s no God, there’s no Devil. No one cares!&#x27;&quot; According to Gilmore, 

The church has stated its contention that they are the first formally organized religion to adopt the term &quot;Satanism&quot; and describes the term &quot;Theistic Satanism&quot; as &quot;oxymoronic&quot;.
LaVey&#x27;s views on magic were ambiguous. He insisted Satanism was a &quot;materialist philosophy&quot; but also often talked of magic.
He included this rule in his &quot;Rules of the Earth&quot;:
LaVey also often talked of a &quot;Satanic magical formula&quot; of &quot;nine parts respectability to one part outrageousness&quot;, satanism requiring some element of sinisterness, but not so much as to put off potential congregants. The &quot;Rules of the Earth&quot; in LaVey&#x27;s Satanic Bible specifically prohibited unwanted sexual advances and harming animals or children, but the Church also &quot;often featured a nude woman serving as an altar&quot; in its black masses.

Though not emphasizing social or political causes, like Ayn Rand, LaVey explicitly opposed egalitarianism and supported social stratification, calling for the end of the “myth of ‘equality’”, which only “supports the weak at the expense of the strong”. But he also suggested that in loving themselves, hedonists developed the ability to love others. He was quoted as saying, “If Satanists didn’t care, they wouldn’t be so dark and pessimistic.”

==History==

===Early years===

In the 1960s Anton Szandor LaVey formed a group called the Order of the Trapezoid, which later became the governing body of the Church of Satan. The group included: &quot;The Baroness&quot; Carin de Plessen, Dr. Cecil Nixon, Kenneth Anger, San Francisco city assessor Russell Wolden, and Donald Werby. According to the Church of Satan historiography, other LaVey associates from this time include noted science fiction and horror writers Anthony Boucher, August Derleth, Robert Barbour Johnson, Reginald Bretnor, Emil Petaja, Stuart Palmer, Clark Ashton Smith, Forrest J. Ackerman, and Fritz Leiber Jr.

The Church of Satan was established at the Black House in San Francisco, California, on Walpurgisnacht, April 30, 1966, by LaVey, who was the church&#x27;s High Priest until his death in 1997.

In the first year of its foundation, LaVey and the Church of Satan publicly performed a Satanic marriage of Judith Case and journalist John Raymond. The ceremony was attended by Joe Rosenthal. LaVey performed the first publicly recorded Satanic baptism in history for his youngest daughter Zeena, which garnered worldwide publicity and was originally recorded on &quot;The Satanic Mass&quot; LP. A Satanic funeral for naval machinist-repairman, third-class Edward Olsen, was performed at the request of his wife, complete with an honor guard.

The Church of Satan was the subject of a number of books, magazine and newspaper articles during the 1960s and 1970s. It is also the subject of a documentary, &quot;Satanis&quot; (1970). LaVey appeared in Kenneth Anger&#x27;s film &quot;Invocation of My Demon Brother&quot;, acted as technical adviser on &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Rain&quot;, which starred Ernest Borgnine, William Shatner, and introduced John Travolta. The Church of Satan was also featured in a segment of Luigi Scattini&#x27;s film &quot;Angeli Bianchi, Angeli Neri&quot;, released in the United States as &quot;Witchcraft &#x27;70&quot;.

One attempt to establish the church abroad was done in connection with Maarten Lamers of the Netherlands who read The Satanic Bible and in 1971 flew to San Francisco to meet LaVey. Back in Amsterdam, Lamers established the first CoS grotto outside the U.S. -- the Magistralis Grotto or the &quot;Kerk van Satan&quot;. The &quot;Kerk&quot; was in the Red Light District and connected to a club called Walpurga Abbey where customers could pay by the minute to observe “monastic sisters” of the Abbey masturbate on stage. Lamers insisted that since the sisters were &quot;performing religious acts of sexual magic&quot;, Walpurga Abbey was tax-exempt. The Dutch government disagreed and in 1987, &quot;after a decade of police raids and legal battles&quot;, Lamers was compelled to pay 10 million guilders in back taxes.

In 1972, LaVey stopped holding weekly rituals at the Black House and announced these would be done at the local grottos. Then on September 27, 1974, he declared the end of all regional organizations and that individual members and grottos should report to the Church&#x27;s Central Grotto in San Francisco. LaVey called this move “Phase IV of his master plan”

=== Schisms ===
Starting in the early 1970s, the Church faced internal dissent and a series of schisms. The first breakaway was by the Babylonian Grotto and its leader Wayne West, who LaVey excommunicated. A bigger schism happened with the excommunication of the Stygian Grotto, whose leader established the Church of Satanic Brotherhood in 1973 with units in Dayton, Indianapolis, Louisville, New York City, and St. Petersburg (FL). From the Church&#x27;s Belphegor Grotto, another splinter group created the Order of the Black Goat, which was allegedly neo-Nazi in orientation, led by Michael Grumbowski. A later, more resilient offshoot was the World Church of Satanic Liberation, which ran from 1986 to 2011.

In 1975, the Church of Satan underwent a significant fracture. Michael Angelo Aquino, the editor of the church newsletter and a fairly high level leader in the church, who disagreed with LaVey&#x27;s changes, left to found the Temple of Set, taking a significant portion of the CoS leadership with him. This schism involved the largest Church branch, the Nineveh Grotto in NJ, and the Lilith Grotto in NY, among others. The Temple of Set reportedly had more than 500 members at its founding, although Anton LaVey claimed that only 29 people left.

LaVey announced that the Temple of Set schism was not a setback but &quot;Phase V&quot; of his master plan, however, according to author Amina Lap, from this point on Satanism became a &quot;splintered and disorganized movement&quot;.

Schisms from the Church were caused by several factors, according to sociologist Foertsch. He focused on differences in costliness or barriers to entry for members, disputes over authority and doctrine, and opportunities for niche development in the American counter-culture world of occultism, and persecution of alleged Satanists during the moral panic (described below) of the 1980s.

The same year LaVey painted the Black House beige to lessen unwanted attention and &quot;largely retired from public life&quot;. (In 1986, the Black House was repainted black.) According to at least one critic, James R. Lewis, LaVey was not instituting &quot;a Master Plan&quot; but demonstrating that he “was not up to making the necessary personal sacrifices that being a founding prophet and leader required&quot; because his motives for founding the Church were personal enrichment and self-aggrandizement, not spreading some religious truth.

===1980s, early 1990s, and &quot;Satanic Panic&quot;===

In the 1980s a phenomenon that became known as the &quot;Satanic Panic&quot; arose and the media reported concerns of criminal conspiracies by the Church of Satan. According to a report released in 2020, LaVey indicated to FBI agents who interviewed him on October 31, 1980 that he had lost interest in the Church. 

During the 1980s and 90s, LaVey was no longer interested in making media appearances and began a &quot;long period of silence&quot;, becoming &quot;increasingly reclusive&quot;. In 1985, he began sending his daughter Zeena to represent the CoS. She appeared on television and radio broadcasts (including &quot;The Phil Donahue Show&quot;, &quot;Nightline with Ted Koppel&quot;, &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;, &quot;The Late Show&quot;, &quot;Secrets &amp; Mysteries&quot; and &quot;the Sally Jesse Raphael Show&quot;) 
to both educate about the Church and to debunk Satanic ritual abuse and any connection between those allegations and true Satanism (specifically the Church of Satan). She also became the High Priestess of the Church during this time and in 1988 married Nikolas Schreck.

On Walpurgisnacht 30 April 1990, Zeena formally renounced any association with the Church or LaVey, whom she now called her “unfather,” changing her maiden name to her then married name Schreck, the surname she retained after her divorce. Shortly after leaving the church, Zeena testified against LaVey in support of her mother&#x27;s (Diane Hegarty) palimony lawsuit against LaVey. The court awarded Hegarty half of LaVey’s property, forcing him to sell the Black House and bankrupting him. Zeena and her husband later joined the Temple of Set for a time but in 2002 she resigned and formed the Sethian Liberation Movement. 

In the 1990s remaining members of the Church of Satan became active in media appearances to refute allegations of criminal activity. Members of the Church who were active in producing movies, music, films, and magazines devoted to Satanism include Adam Parfrey&#x27;s Feral House publishing, the musician Boyd Rice, musician King Diamond, and the filmmaker Nick Bougas (a.k.a. A. Wyatt Mann).

In 1994, Kenneth Lanning, an FBI expert in investigating child sexual abuse, produced a report on Satanic Ritual Abuse (SRA) aimed at child protection authorities, which stated that despite hundreds of investigations, no corroboration of SRA had been found. Following this report, several convictions based on SRA allegations were overturned and the defendants released.

===After LaVey===
After Anton Szandor LaVey&#x27;s death on October 29, 1997, the role of High Priest was empty for some time. On November 7, 1997 Karla LaVey made a press release about continuing the church with fellow high priestess Blanche Barton. Barton eventually received ownership of the organization, which she held for 4 years. Karla LaVey ultimately left the Church of Satan and founded First Satanic Church. On October 16, 2001, the Black House, the original home of the Church, was demolished after a fundraising effort failed to raise enough to buy it. (In 1992, LaVey had sold the house to a real estate developer to raise money to settle a divorce but the developer allowed LaVey to continue to live in the house for free.)

In 2001, Blanche ceded her position to longtime members Peter H. Gilmore and Peggy Nadramia, the current High Priest and High Priestess and publishers of &quot;The Black Flame&quot;, the official magazine of The Church of Satan, who managed an active CoS group in New York. The Central Office of the Church of Satan has also moved from San Francisco to New York City&#x27;s Hell&#x27;s Kitchen neighborhood, where the couple resides. The Church of Satan does not recognize any other organizations as holding legitimate claim to Satanism and its practice, though it does recognize that one need not be a member of the Church of Satan to be a Satanist.

In October 2004, the Royal Navy officially recognised its first registered Satanist, 24-year-old Chris Cranmer, as a technician aboard .

===6/6/06 High Mass===

On June 6, 2006, the Church of Satan held the first public ritual Satanic Mass in 40 years at the Steve Allen Theater in the Center for Inquiry in Los Angeles. The date corresponds to the number of the Beast, 666, from the biblical Book of Revelation. The ritual, based on the rites outlined in &quot;The Satanic Bible&quot; and &quot;The Satanic Rituals&quot;, was conducted by Reverend Bryan Moore and Priestess Heather Saenz.

The event was by invitation only, and over one hundred members of the Church of Satan from around the world filled the theatre to capacity. Many members of the Church of Satan were interviewed by the BBC with permission. The music for the mass was created and performed by Lustmord and was subsequently released on his album &quot;Rising&quot;.

===Example of law abidingness===
In December 2007 the Associated Press reported on a story concerning the Church of Satan, in which a teenager had sent an email to High Priest Gilmore stating he wanted to &quot;kill in the name of our unholy lord Satan&quot;. Gilmore then reported the message to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who informed local police, who arrested the teenager.

=== &quot;Realm of Satan&quot; documentary ===
In January 2024, the film &quot;Realm of Satan&quot; was shown at the Sundance Film Festival. The film is similar to a documentary, though it consists primarily of scenes staged with members of the Church of Satan. One reviewer described it as &quot;an 80-minute art installation in which Satanists are rendered—and deliberately render themselves—performative characters in a diabolical play of their own making.&quot; The film is directed by Scott Cummings and it shows a variety of satanic rituals, which may have been performed for the film alone.

==Membership==
The Church of Satan claims they do not solicit memberships nor proselytize. Individuals seeking membership must be legally defined as adults in their nation of residence. As of at least January 2023, no one &quot;under the legal age of consent&quot; may join the Church of Satan, with the exception those whose &quot;parents or legal guardians are already members in good standing&quot;.

Active Members begin at the First Degree. One must apply and be approved for an Active Membership, and this is subject to one&#x27;s answers to a lengthy series of questions. One cannot apply for higher Degrees, and the requirements for each degree are not open to the public. Promotion to a higher degree is by invitation only. Members of the Third through Fifth degrees constitute the Priesthood and may be addressed as &quot;Reverend&quot; (although the titles of &quot;Magister/Magistra&quot; and &quot;Magus/Maga&quot; are more often used when referring to members of the Fourth and Fifth Degrees, respectively). Members of the Fifth degree may also be known as &quot;Doctor&quot;, although &quot;The Doctor&quot; usually refers to LaVey. Memberships may be terminated at the discretion of the ruling body of the Church of Satan consisting of the High Priest, the High Priestess and the Council of Nine.

The church emphasizes that one does not have to join the organization to consider themselves a Satanist, and that one only needs to recognize themselves in The Satanic Bible and live according to the tenets outlined therein.

As the Church of Satan does not publicly release membership information, it is not known how many members belong to the Church. However, according to an interview with the Church of Satan, &quot;interest in the Church of Satan and Satanism is growing all the time if our mailboxes, answering and fax machines, and e-mail is any indication.&quot; Another source (&quot;The Washington Post&quot;) states the church claimed to have &quot;hundreds of thousands&quot; of members. 
However, according to Joseph Laycock, the Church grew rapidly in its first five years before declining, and had an estimated 250 members (according to one source). According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, up until at least 1998, Church membership was never totaled &quot;more than 300&quot;.

===Hierarchy===
The church follows a formulated system of degrees based on meritocracy. These degrees are not open to application or to request and are only awarded to those who demonstrate excellence in the understanding and communication of Satanic Theory coupled with personal achievements in the outside world.

These degrees are:
* Registered Member (no degree)
* Active Member/Satanist (first degree)
* Witch/Warlock (second degree)
* Priestess/Priest (third degree)
* Magistra/Magister (fourth degree)
* Maga/Magus (fifth degree)

Agents of the Church of Satan are individuals who have been trained to serve as contacts for local media and other interested parties.

===Priesthood of Mendes and Council of Nine===
Members of the Priesthood make up the Council of Nine, which is the ruling body of the Church of Satan, of which Magistra Templi Rex Blanche Barton is the chair-mistress. Individuals who are part of the priesthood are those who act as spokespersons of the Church of Satan. The priesthood is exclusive to third-, fourth-, and fifth-degree members. Members of the priesthood may be referred to as &quot;reverend&quot;. The High Priest and Priestess act as administrative chiefs and primary public representatives; each position (High Priest and High Priestess) is held by a single individual at a time. The current High Priest is Peter H. Gilmore, the current High Priestess is Peggy Nadramia.

The Church of Satan evaluates active members for the Priesthood by their accomplishment in society—mastered skills and peer recognition within a profession—rather than by mastery of irrelevant occult trivia. While expected to be experts in communicating the Satanic philosophy, members of the Priesthood are not required to speak on behalf of the Church of Satan and may even choose to keep their affiliation and rank secret in order to better serve their personal goals, as well as those of the organization. Membership in the Priesthood is by invitation only.

===The Grotto System===

Within Satanism, a Grotto is a clandestine association or gathering of Satanists within geographical proximity for means of social, ritual, and special interest activities. The Church of Satan no longer formally recognizes or charters grottos. The primary reason for the end of the Grotto system is that only a small minority of members ever participated. This was further compounded by the fact that a publicly listed Grotto defeated the ability to remain secret and unknown to the larger populace. The Grotto system was in practice replaced by social media, private online forums, and other methods for members to interact with one another outside of the need for a so-called Grotto Master and annual reports to the central office of the Church of Satan.

<text>In cartography, a map projection is any of a broad set of transformations employed to represent the curved two-dimensional surface of a globe on a plane. In a map projection, coordinates, often expressed as latitude and longitude, of locations from the surface of the globe are transformed to coordinates on a plane.
Projection is a necessary step in creating a two-dimensional map and is one of the essential elements of cartography.

All projections of a sphere on a plane necessarily distort the surface in some way. Depending on the purpose of the map, some distortions are acceptable and others are not; therefore, different map projections exist in order to preserve some properties of the sphere-like body at the expense of other properties. The study of map projections is primarily about the characterization of their distortions. There is no limit to the number of possible map projections.
More generally, projections are considered in several fields of pure mathematics, including differential geometry, projective geometry, and manifolds. However, the term &quot;map projection&quot; refers specifically to a cartographic projection.

Despite the name&#x27;s literal meaning, projection is not limited to perspective projections, such as those resulting from casting a shadow on a screen, or the rectilinear image produced by a pinhole camera on a flat film plate. Rather, any mathematical function that transforms coordinates from the curved surface distinctly and smoothly to the plane is a projection. Few projections in practical use are perspective.

Most of this article assumes that the surface to be mapped is that of a sphere. The Earth and other large celestial bodies are generally better modeled as oblate spheroids, whereas small objects such as asteroids often have irregular shapes. The surfaces of planetary bodies can be mapped even if they are too irregular to be modeled well with a sphere or ellipsoid. Therefore, more generally, a map projection is any method of flattening a continuous curved surface onto a plane.

The most well-known map projection is the Mercator projection. This map projection has the property of being conformal. However, it has been criticized throughout the 20th century for enlarging regions further from the equator. To contrast, equal-area projections such as the Sinusoidal projection and the Gall–Peters projection show the correct sizes of countries relative to each other, but distort angles. The National Geographic Society and most atlases favor map projections that compromise between area and angular distortion, such as the Robinson projection and the Winkel tripel projection.

==Metric properties of maps==
Many properties can be measured on the Earth&#x27;s surface independently of its geography:
* Area
* Shape
* Direction
* Bearing
* Distance

Map projections can be constructed to preserve some of these properties at the expense of others. Because the Earth&#x27;s curved surface is not isometric to a plane, preservation of shapes inevitably requires a variable scale and, consequently, non-proportional presentation of areas. Similarly, an area-preserving projection can not be conformal, resulting in shapes and bearings distorted in most places of the map. Each projection preserves, compromises, or approximates basic metric properties in different ways. The purpose of the map determines which projection should form the base for the map. Because maps have many different purposes, a diversity of projections have been created to suit those purposes.

Another consideration in the configuration of a projection is its compatibility with data sets to be used on the map. Data sets are geographic information; their collection depends on the chosen datum (model) of the Earth. Different datums assign slightly different coordinates to the same location, so in large scale maps, such as those from national mapping systems, it is important to match the datum to the projection. The slight differences in coordinate assignation between different datums is not a concern for world maps or those of large regions, where such differences are reduced to imperceptibility.

===Distortion===

Carl Friedrich Gauss&#x27;s &quot;Theorema Egregium&quot; proved that a sphere&#x27;s surface cannot be represented on a plane without distortion. The same applies to other reference surfaces used as models for the Earth, such as oblate spheroids, ellipsoids, and geoids. Since any map projection is a representation of one of those surfaces on a plane, all map projections distort.
The classical way of showing the distortion inherent in a projection is to use Tissot&#x27;s indicatrix. For a given point, using the scale factor &quot;h&quot; along the meridian, the scale factor &quot;k&quot; along the parallel, and the angle &quot;θ&quot;′ between them, Nicolas Tissot described how to construct an ellipse that illustrates the amount and orientation of the components of distortion. By spacing the ellipses regularly along the meridians and parallels, the network of indicatrices shows how distortion varies across the map.

====Other distortion metrics====
Many other ways have been described of showing the distortion in projections. Like Tissot&#x27;s indicatrix, the Goldberg-Gott indicatrix is based on infinitesimals, and depicts &quot;flexion&quot; and &quot;skewness&quot; (bending and lopsidedness) distortions.

Rather than the original (enlarged) infinitesimal circle as in Tissot&#x27;s indicatrix, some visual methods project finite shapes that span a part of the map.
For example, a small circle of fixed radius (e.g., 15 degrees angular radius). Sometimes spherical triangles are used.
In the first half of the 20th century, projecting a human head onto different projections was common to show how distortion varies across one projection as compared to another.
In dynamic media, shapes of familiar coastlines and boundaries can be dragged across an interactive map to show how the projection distorts sizes and shapes according to position on the map.

Another way to visualize local distortion is through grayscale or color gradations whose shade represents the magnitude of the angular deformation or areal inflation. Sometimes both are shown simultaneously by blending two colors to create a bivariate map.

To measure distortion globally across areas instead of at just a single point necessarily involves choosing priorities to reach a compromise. Some schemes use distance distortion as a proxy for the combination of angular deformation and areal inflation; such methods arbitrarily choose what paths to measure and how to weight them in order to yield a single result. Many have been described.

==Design and construction==
The creation of a map projection involves two steps:

# Selection of a model for the shape of the Earth or planetary body (usually choosing between a sphere or ellipsoid). Because the Earth&#x27;s actual shape is irregular, information is lost in this step.
# Transformation of geographic coordinates (longitude and latitude) to Cartesian (&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) or polar (&quot;r&quot;, &quot;θ&quot;) plane coordinates. In large-scale maps, Cartesian coordinates normally have a simple relation to eastings and northings defined as a grid superimposed on the projection. In small-scale maps, eastings and northings are not meaningful, and grids are not superimposed.
Some of the simplest map projections are literal projections, as obtained by placing a light source at some definite point relative to the globe and projecting its features onto a specified surface. Although most projections are not defined in this way, picturing the light source-globe model can be helpful in understanding the basic concept of a map projection.

===Choosing a projection surface===

A surface that can be unfolded or unrolled into a plane or sheet without stretching, tearing or shrinking is called a &quot;developable surface&quot;. The cylinder, cone and the plane are all developable surfaces. The sphere and ellipsoid do not have developable surfaces, so any projection of them onto a plane will have to distort the image. (To compare, one cannot flatten an orange peel without tearing and warping it.)

One way of describing a projection is first to project from the Earth&#x27;s surface to a developable surface such as a cylinder or cone, and then to unroll the surface into a plane. While the first step inevitably distorts some properties of the globe, the developable surface can then be unfolded without further distortion.

===Aspect of the projection===

Once a choice is made between projecting onto a cylinder, cone, or plane, the aspect of the shape must be specified. The aspect describes how the developable surface is placed relative to the globe: it may be &quot;normal&quot; (such that the surface&#x27;s axis of symmetry coincides with the Earth&#x27;s axis), &quot;transverse&quot; (at right angles to the Earth&#x27;s axis) or &quot;oblique&quot; (any angle in between).

===Notable lines===

The developable surface may also be either &quot;tangent&quot; or &quot;secant&quot; to the sphere or ellipsoid. Tangent means the surface touches but does not slice through the globe; secant means the surface does slice through the globe. Moving the developable surface away from contact with the globe never preserves or optimizes metric properties, so that possibility is not discussed further here.

Tangent and secant lines (&quot;standard lines&quot;) are represented undistorted. If these lines are a parallel of latitude, as in conical projections, it is called a &quot;standard parallel&quot;. The &quot;central meridian&quot; is the meridian to which the globe is rotated before projecting. The central meridian (usually written &quot;λ&quot;) and a parallel of origin (usually written &quot;φ&quot;) are often used to define the origin of the map projection.

===Scale===

A globe is the only way to represent the Earth with constant scale throughout the entire map in all directions. A map cannot achieve that property for any area, no matter how small. It can, however, achieve constant scale along specific lines.

Some possible properties are:
* The scale depends on location, but not on direction. This is equivalent to preservation of angles, the defining characteristic of a conformal map.
* Scale is constant along any parallel in the direction of the parallel. This applies for any cylindrical or pseudocylindrical projection in normal aspect.
* Combination of the above: the scale depends on latitude only, not on longitude or direction. This applies for the Mercator projection in normal aspect.
* Scale is constant along all straight lines radiating from a particular geographic location. This is the defining characteristic of an equidistant projection such as the azimuthal equidistant projection. There are also projections (Maurer&#x27;s two-point equidistant projection, Close) where true distances from &quot;two&quot; points are preserved.

===Choosing a model for the shape of the body===
Projection construction is also affected by how the shape of the Earth or planetary body is approximated. In the following section on projection categories, the earth is taken as a sphere in order to simplify the discussion. However, the Earth&#x27;s actual shape is closer to an oblate ellipsoid. Whether spherical or ellipsoidal, the principles discussed hold without loss of generality.

Selecting a model for a shape of the Earth involves choosing between the advantages and disadvantages of a sphere versus an ellipsoid. Spherical models are useful for small-scale maps such as world atlases and globes, since the error at that scale is not usually noticeable or important enough to justify using the more complicated ellipsoid. The ellipsoidal model is commonly used to construct topographic maps and for other large- and medium-scale maps that need to accurately depict the land surface. Auxiliary latitudes are often employed in projecting the ellipsoid.

A third model is the geoid, a more complex and accurate representation of Earth&#x27;s shape coincident with what mean sea level would be if there were no winds, tides, or land. Compared to the best fitting ellipsoid, a geoidal model would change the characterization of important properties such as distance, conformality and equivalence. Therefore, in geoidal projections that preserve such properties, the mapped graticule would deviate from a mapped ellipsoid&#x27;s graticule. Normally the geoid is not used as an Earth model for projections, however, because Earth&#x27;s shape is very regular, with the undulation of the geoid amounting to less than 100 m from the ellipsoidal model out of the 6.3 million m Earth radius. For irregular planetary bodies such as asteroids, however, sometimes models analogous to the geoid are used to project maps from. 

Other regular solids are sometimes used as generalizations for smaller bodies&#x27; geoidal equivalent. For example, Io is better modeled by triaxial ellipsoid or prolated spheroid with small eccentricities. Haumea&#x27;s shape is a Jacobi ellipsoid, with its major axis twice as long as its minor and with its middle axis one and half times as long as its minor.
See map projection of the triaxial ellipsoid for further information.

==Classification==
One way to classify map projections is based on the type of surface onto which the globe is projected. In this scheme, the projection process is described as placing a hypothetical projection surface the size of the desired study area in contact with part of the Earth, transferring features of the Earth&#x27;s surface onto the projection surface, then unraveling and scaling the projection surface into a flat map. The most common projection surfaces are cylindrical (e.g., Mercator), conic (e.g., Albers), and planar (e.g., stereographic). Many mathematical projections, however, do not neatly fit into any of these three projection methods. Hence other peer categories have been described in the literature, such as pseudoconic, pseudocylindrical, pseudoazimuthal, retroazimuthal, and polyconic.

Another way to classify projections is according to properties of the model they preserve. Some of the more common categories are:
* Preserving direction (&quot;azimuthal or zenithal&quot;), a trait possible only from one or two points to every other point
* Preserving shape locally (&quot;conformal&quot; or &quot;orthomorphic&quot;)
* Preserving area (&quot;equal-area&quot; or &quot;equiareal&quot; or &quot;equivalent&quot; or &quot;authalic&quot;)
* Preserving distance (&quot;equidistant&quot;), a trait possible only between one or two points and every other point
* Preserving shortest route, a trait preserved only by the gnomonic projection
Because the sphere is not a developable surface, it is impossible to construct a map projection that is both equal-area and conformal.

==Projections by surface==

The three developable surfaces (plane, cylinder, cone) provide useful models for understanding, describing, and developing map projections. However, these models are limited in two fundamental ways. For one thing, most world projections in use do not fall into any of those categories. For another thing, even most projections that do fall into those categories are not naturally attainable through physical projection. As L. P. Lee notes,

Lee&#x27;s objection refers to the way the terms &quot;cylindrical&quot;, &quot;conic&quot;, and &quot;planar&quot; (azimuthal) have been abstracted in the field of map projections. If maps were projected as in light shining through a globe onto a developable surface, then the spacing of parallels would follow a very limited set of possibilities. Such a cylindrical projection (for example) is one which:
# Is rectangular;
# Has straight vertical meridians, spaced evenly;
# Has straight parallels symmetrically placed about the equator;
# Has parallels constrained to where they fall when light shines through the globe onto the cylinder, with the light source someplace along the line formed by the intersection of the prime meridian with the equator, and the center of the sphere.

(If you rotate the globe before projecting then the parallels and meridians will not necessarily still be straight lines. Rotations are normally ignored for the purpose of classification.)

Where the light source emanates along the line described in this last constraint is what yields the differences between the various &quot;natural&quot; cylindrical projections. But the term &quot;cylindrical&quot; as used in the field of map projections relaxes the last constraint entirely. Instead the parallels can be placed according to any algorithm the designer has decided suits the needs of the map. The famous Mercator projection is one in which the placement of parallels does not arise by projection; instead parallels are placed how they need to be in order to satisfy the property that a course of constant bearing is always plotted as a straight line.

===Cylindrical===

====Normal cylindrical====

A normal cylindrical projection is any projection in which meridians are mapped to equally spaced vertical lines and circles of latitude (parallels) are mapped to horizontal lines.

The mapping of meridians to vertical lines can be visualized by imagining a cylinder whose axis coincides with the Earth&#x27;s axis of rotation. This cylinder is wrapped around the Earth, projected onto, and then unrolled.

By the geometry of their construction, cylindrical projections stretch distances east-west. The amount of stretch is the same at any chosen latitude on all cylindrical projections, and is given by the secant of the latitude as a multiple of the equator&#x27;s scale. The various cylindrical projections are distinguished from each other solely by their north-south stretching (where latitude is given by φ):
* North-south stretching equals east-west stretching (sec &quot;φ&quot;): The east-west scale matches the north-south scale: conformal cylindrical or Mercator; this distorts areas excessively in high latitudes.
* North-south stretching grows with latitude faster than east-west stretching (sec &quot;φ&quot;): The cylindric perspective (or central cylindrical) projection; unsuitable because distortion is even worse than in the Mercator projection.
* North-south stretching grows with latitude, but less quickly than the east-west stretching: such as the Miller cylindrical projection (sec &quot;φ&quot;).
* North-south distances neither stretched nor compressed (1): equirectangular projection or &quot;plate carrée&quot;.
* North-south compression equals the cosine of the latitude (the reciprocal of east-west stretching): equal-area cylindrical. This projection has many named specializations differing only in the scaling constant, such as the Gall–Peters or Gall orthographic (undistorted at the 45° parallels), Behrmann (undistorted at the 30° parallels), and Lambert cylindrical equal-area (undistorted at the equator). Since this projection scales north-south distances by the reciprocal of east-west stretching, it preserves area at the expense of shapes.

In the first case (Mercator), the east-west scale always equals the north-south scale. In the second case (central cylindrical), the north-south scale exceeds the east-west scale everywhere away from the equator. Each remaining case has a pair of secant lines—a pair of identical latitudes of opposite sign (or else the equator) at which the east-west scale matches the north-south-scale.

Normal cylindrical projections map the whole Earth as a finite rectangle, except in the first two cases, where the rectangle stretches infinitely tall while retaining constant width.

====Transverse cylindrical====
A transverse cylindrical projection is a cylindrical projection that in the tangent case uses a great circle along a meridian as contact line for the cylinder.

See: transverse Mercator.

====Oblique cylindrical====

An oblique cylindrical projection aligns with a great circle, but not the equator and not a meridian.

===Pseudocylindrical===

Pseudocylindrical projections represent the &quot;central&quot; meridian as a straight line segment. Other meridians are longer than the central meridian and bow outward, away from the central meridian. Pseudocylindrical projections map parallels as straight lines. Along parallels, each point from the surface is mapped at a distance from the central meridian that is proportional to its difference in longitude from the central meridian. Therefore, meridians are equally spaced along a given parallel. On a pseudocylindrical map, any point further from the equator than some other point has a higher latitude than the other point, preserving north-south relationships. This trait is useful when illustrating phenomena that depend on latitude, such as climate. Examples of pseudocylindrical projections include:
* Sinusoidal, which was the first pseudocylindrical projection developed. On the map, as in reality, the length of each parallel is proportional to the cosine of the latitude. The area of any region is true.
* Collignon projection, which in its most common forms represents each meridian as two straight line segments, one from each pole to the equator.
===Hybrid===
The HEALPix projection combines an equal-area cylindrical projection in equatorial regions with the Collignon projection in polar areas.

===Conic===
The term &quot;conic projection&quot; is used to refer to any projection in which meridians are mapped to equally spaced lines radiating out from the apex and circles of latitude (parallels) are mapped to circular arcs centered on the apex.
When making a conic map, the map maker arbitrarily picks two standard parallels. Those standard parallels may be visualized as secant lines where the cone intersects the globe—or, if the map maker chooses the same parallel twice, as the tangent line where the cone is tangent to the globe. The resulting conic map has low distortion in scale, shape, and area near those standard parallels. Distances along the parallels to the north of both standard parallels or to the south of both standard parallels are stretched; distances along parallels between the standard parallels are compressed. When a single standard parallel is used, distances along all other parallels are stretched.

Conic projections that are commonly used are:
* Equidistant conic, which keeps parallels evenly spaced along the meridians to preserve a constant distance scale along each meridian, typically the same or similar scale as along the standard parallels.
* Albers conic, which adjusts the north-south distance between non-standard parallels to compensate for the east-west stretching or compression, giving an equal-area map.
* Lambert conformal conic, which adjusts the north-south distance between non-standard parallels to equal the east-west stretching, giving a conformal map.

===Pseudoconic===
* Bonne, an equal-area projection on which most meridians and parallels appear as curved lines. It has a configurable standard parallel along which there is no distortion.
* Werner cordiform, upon which distances are correct from one pole, as well as along all parallels.
* American polyconic and other projections in the polyconic projection class.

===Azimuthal (projections onto a plane)===

Azimuthal projections have the property that directions from a central point are preserved and therefore great circles through the central point are represented by straight lines on the map. These projections also have radial symmetry in the scales and hence in the distortions: map distances from the central point are computed by a function &quot;r&quot;(&quot;d&quot;) of the true distance &quot;d&quot;, independent of the angle; correspondingly, circles with the central point as center are mapped into circles which have as center the central point on the map.

The mapping of radial lines can be visualized by imagining a plane tangent to the Earth, with the central point as tangent point.

The radial scale is &quot;r′&quot;(&quot;d&quot;) and the transverse scale &quot;r&quot;(&quot;d&quot;)/(&quot;R&quot; sin ) where &quot;R&quot; is the radius of the Earth.

Some azimuthal projections are true perspective projections; that is, they can be constructed mechanically, projecting the surface of the Earth by extending lines from a point of perspective (along an infinite line through the tangent point and the tangent point&#x27;s antipode) onto the plane:
* The gnomonic projection displays great circles as straight lines. Can be constructed by using a point of perspective at the center of the Earth. &quot;r&quot;(&quot;d&quot;) = &quot;c&quot; tan ; so that even just a hemisphere is already infinite in extent.
* The orthographic projection maps each point on the Earth to the closest point on the plane. Can be constructed from a point of perspective an infinite distance from the tangent point; &quot;r&quot;(&quot;d&quot;) = &quot;c&quot; sin . Can display up to a hemisphere on a finite circle. Photographs of Earth from far enough away, such as the Moon, approximate this perspective.
* Near-sided perspective projection, which simulates the view from space at a finite distance and therefore shows less than a full hemisphere, such as used in &quot;The Blue Marble 2012&quot;).
* The General Perspective projection can be constructed by using a point of perspective outside the Earth. Photographs of Earth (such as those from the International Space Station) give this perspective. It is a generalization of near-sided perspective projection, allowing tilt.
* The stereographic projection, which is conformal, can be constructed by using the tangent point&#x27;s antipode as the point of perspective. &quot;r&quot;(&quot;d&quot;) = &quot;c&quot; tan ; the scale is &quot;c&quot;/(2&quot;R&quot; cos ). Can display nearly the entire sphere&#x27;s surface on a finite circle. The sphere&#x27;s full surface requires an infinite map.

Other azimuthal projections are not true perspective projections:
* Azimuthal equidistant: &quot;r&quot;(&quot;d&quot;) = &quot;cd&quot;; it is used by amateur radio operators to know the direction to point their antennas toward a point and see the distance to it. Distance from the tangent point on the map is proportional to surface distance on the Earth (; for the case where the tangent point is the North Pole, see the flag of the United Nations)
* Lambert azimuthal equal-area. Distance from the tangent point on the map is proportional to straight-line distance through the Earth: &quot;r&quot;(&quot;d&quot;) = &quot;c&quot; sin 
* Logarithmic azimuthal is constructed so that each point&#x27;s distance from the center of the map is the logarithm of its distance from the tangent point on the Earth. &quot;r&quot;(&quot;d&quot;) = &quot;c&quot; ln ); locations closer than at a distance equal to the constant &quot;d&quot;0 are not shown.
===Polyhedral===
Polyhedral map projections use a polyhedron to subdivide the globe into faces, and then projects each face to the globe. The most well-known polyhedral map projection is Buckminster Fuller&#x27;s Dymaxion map.

==Projections by preservation of a metric property==

===Conformal===
Conformal, or orthomorphic, map projections preserve angles locally, implying that they map infinitesimal circles of constant size anywhere on the Earth to infinitesimal circles of varying sizes on the map. In contrast, mappings that are not conformal distort most such small circles into ellipses of distortion. An important consequence of conformality
is that relative angles at each point of the map are correct, and the local scale (although varying throughout the map) in every direction around any one point is constant. These are some conformal projections:
* Mercator: Rhumb lines are represented by straight segments
* Transverse Mercator
* Stereographic: Any circle of a sphere, great and small, maps to a circle or straight line.
* Roussilhe
* Lambert conformal conic
* Peirce quincuncial projection
* Adams hemisphere-in-a-square projection
* Guyou hemisphere-in-a-square projection

===Equal-area===

Equal-area maps preserve area measure, generally distorting shapes in order to do so. Equal-area maps are also called &quot;equivalent&quot; or &quot;authalic&quot;. These are some projections that preserve area:
* Albers conic
* Boggs eumorphic
* Bonne
* Bottomley
* Collignon
* Cylindrical equal-area
* Eckert II, IV and VI
* Equal Earth
* Gall orthographic (also known as Gall–Peters, or Peters, projection)
* Goode&#x27;s homolosine
* Hammer
* Hobo–Dyer
* Lambert azimuthal equal-area
* Lambert cylindrical equal-area
* Mollweide
* Sinusoidal
* Strebe 1995
* Snyder&#x27;s equal-area polyhedral projection, used for geodesic grids.
* Tobler hyperelliptical
* Werner
===Equidistant===

If the length of the line segment connecting two projected points on the plane is proportional to the geodesic (shortest surface) distance between the two unprojected points on the globe, then we say that distance has been preserved between those two points. An equidistant projection preserves distances from one or two special points to all other points. The special point or points may get stretched into a line or curve segment when projected. In that case, the point on the line or curve segment closest to the point being measured to must be used to measure the distance.
* Plate carrée: Distances from the two poles are preserved, in equatorial aspect.
* Azimuthal equidistant: Distances from the center and edge are preserved.
* Equidistant conic: Distances from the two poles are preserved, in equatorial aspect.
* Werner cordiform Distances from the North Pole are preserved, in equatorial aspect.
* Two-point equidistant: Two &quot;control points&quot; are arbitrarily chosen by the map maker; distances from each control point are preserved.

===Gnomonic===
Great circles are displayed as straight lines:
* Gnomonic projection

===Retroazimuthal===
Direction to a fixed location B (the bearing at the starting location A of the shortest route) corresponds to the direction on the map from A to B:
* Littrow—the only conformal retroazimuthal projection
* Hammer retroazimuthal—also preserves distance from the central point
* Craig retroazimuthal &quot;aka&quot; Mecca or Qibla—also has vertical meridians

===Compromise projections===
Compromise projections give up the idea of perfectly preserving metric properties, seeking instead to strike a balance between distortions, or to simply make things look right. Most of these types of projections distort shape in the polar regions more than at the equator. These are some compromise projections:
* Robinson
* van der Grinten
* Miller cylindrical
* Winkel Tripel
* Buckminster Fuller&#x27;s Dymaxion
* B. J. S. Cahill&#x27;s Butterfly Map
* Kavrayskiy VII projection
* Wagner VI projection
* Chamberlin trimetric
* Oronce Finé&#x27;s cordiform
* AuthaGraph projection

== Suitability of projections for application ==

The mathematics of projection do not permit any particular map projection to be best for everything. Something will always be distorted. Thus, many projections exist to serve the many uses of maps and their vast range of scales.

Modern national mapping systems typically employ a transverse Mercator or close variant for large-scale maps in order to preserve conformality and low variation in scale over small areas. For smaller-scale maps, such as those spanning continents or the entire world, many projections are in common use according to their fitness for the purpose, such as Winkel tripel, Robinson and Mollweide. Reference maps of the world often appear on compromise projections. Due to distortions inherent in any map of the world, the choice of projection becomes largely one of aesthetics.

Thematic maps normally require an equal area projection so that phenomena per unit area are shown in correct proportion.
However, representing area ratios correctly necessarily distorts shapes more than many maps that are not equal-area.

The Mercator projection, developed for navigational purposes, has often been used in world maps where other projections would have been more appropriate. This problem has long been recognized even outside professional circles. For example, a 1943 &quot;New York Times&quot; editorial states:

A controversy in the 1980s over the Peters map motivated the American Cartographic Association (now the Cartography and Geographic Information Society) to produce a series of booklets (including &quot;Which Map Is Best&quot;) designed to educate the public about map projections and distortion in maps. In 1989 and 1990, after some internal debate, seven North American geographic organizations adopted a resolution recommending against using any rectangular projection (including Mercator and Gall–Peters) for reference maps of the world.

<text>The Flintstones is an American animated sitcom produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions, which takes place in a romanticized Stone Age setting and follows the titular family, the Flintstones, and their next-door neighbors, the Rubbles. It was originally broadcast on ABC from September 30, 1960, to April 1, 1966, and was the first animated series with a prime-time slot on television.

The show follows the lives of Fred and Wilma Flintstone and their pet dinosaur, Dino, a Sabre Tooth Tiger-Cat named Baby Puss, and they later on have a baby girl named Pebbles. Barney and Betty Rubble are their neighbors and best friends, and later on adopt a super-strong baby boy named Bamm-Bamm and acquire a pet hopparoo (kangaroo) called Hoppy.

Producers William Hanna and Joseph Barbera, who had earned seven Academy Awards for &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot;, and their staff faced a challenge in developing a thirty-minute animated program with one storyline that fit the parameters of family-based domestic situation comedies of the era. After considering several settings and selecting the Stone Age, one of several inspirations was &quot;The Honeymooners,&quot; which was itself influenced by &quot;The Bickersons&quot; and Laurel and Hardy (Hanna considered it one of the finest comedies on television).

The enduring popularity of &quot;The Flintstones&quot; mainly comes from its juxtaposition of modern, everyday concerns with the Stone Age setting. Its animation required a balance of visual with verbal storytelling that the studio created and others imitated.

&quot;The Flintstones&quot; was the most financially successful and longest-running network animated television series for three decades, until &quot;The Simpsons&quot; surpassed it in 1997. In 2013, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked &quot;The Flintstones&quot; the second-greatest TV cartoon of all time, after &quot;The Simpsons&quot;.

==Overview==
The show is set in a comical version of the Stone Age, with features and technologies that resemble mid-20th-century suburbia in the United States. The plots deliberately resemble the sitcoms of the era, with the caveman Flintstone and Rubble families getting into minor conflicts characteristic of modern life. The show is set in the Stone Age town of Bedrock (pop. 2,500), where dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures are portrayed as co-existing with cavemen, saber-toothed cats, and woolly mammoths.

Animation historian Christopher P. Lehman considers that the series partly draws its humor from anachronism, mainly the placing of a &quot;modern&quot; 20th-century society in prehistory which takes inspiration from the suburban sprawl developed in the first two decades of the postwar period. This society has modern home appliances which work by employing animals. It also has automobiles, but they mostly do not resemble the cars of the 20th century, as they are large wooden and rock structures powered by people who run while inside them. This depiction varies according to the needs of the story; on some occasions, the cars appear to have engines, requiring ignition keys and some representation of gasoline. Fred might pull into a gas station and say, &quot;Fill &#x27;er up with Ethel&quot;, which is pumped through the trunk of a woolly mammoth marked &quot;ETHEL&quot;. As well, the stone houses of this society are cookie-cutter homes positioned into neighborhoods typical of mid-20th-century American suburbs.

==Characters==
===The Flintstones===
* Frederick Joseph &quot;Fred&quot; Flintstone – The main character of the series and patriarch of the Flintstone family, who is easily angered but a loving husband and father. He is an operator at the Slate Rock and Gravel Company for a bronto-crane, a Brontosaurus used as an excavating machine, but is prone to accidents. He is also overweight and likes to eat copious amounts of unhealthy food. As well, he is good at bowling and is a member of the &quot;Loyal Order of Water Buffaloes&quot; Lodge No. 26, originally called the Loyal Order of Dinosaurs in Season 1, a men-only club which parallels fraternities such as the Loyal Order of Moose. His catchphrase is &quot;Yabba Dabba Doo!&quot;, which is revealed in the first season to be the Lodge&#x27;s official cheer.
* Wilma Anna Flintstone – Fred&#x27;s wife and Pebbles&#x27; mother, who is more intelligent and level-headed than her husband. She often serves as a foil to Fred&#x27;s behavior and is a loyal wife to him. However, she has a habit of spending money, with her and Betty&#x27;s catchphrase being &quot;Da-da-da duh da-da CHARGE it!!&quot;. She can also be jealous, as she becomes easily angered if another woman interacts with Fred.
* Pebbles Wilma Flintstone – The Flintstones&#x27; infant daughter, who is born near the end of the third season. She normally wears a bone in her hair which holds up her hair in a ponytail, and a light green and black shirt with a turquoise and black diaper. She, like her family, does not wear shoes or pants.
* Dino (pronounced &quot;dee-no&quot;) – The Flintstones&#x27; pet dinosaur, who acts like a dog. A running gag in the series involves Fred coming home from work and Dino getting excited and knocking him down.
* Baby Puss – The Flintstones&#x27; pet saber-toothed cat, who is rarely seen in the series, but is seen throwing Fred out of the house during the end credits. This causes Fred to repeatedly pound on the front door and yell &quot;Wilma!&quot;, waking the neighborhood in the process.

====Relatives of the Flintstones====
* Pearl Slaghoople – Wilma&#x27;s hard-to-please mother, Fred&#x27;s mother-in-law, and Pebbles&#x27; grandmother, who constantly disapproves of Fred and his behavior. They briefly reconcile in the episode &quot;Mother-in-Law&#x27;s Visit&quot;, until she learns that Fred suckered her out of money he needed to buy a baby crib for Pebbles. Their disastrous first meeting was recounted in a flashback in the episode &quot;Bachelor Daze&quot;. Her surname was not revealed until the fourth season while her first name, &quot;Pearl&quot;, was conceived after the original series ended in 1966.
* Uncle Tex Hardrock – Fred&#x27;s maternal uncle, Wilma&#x27;s uncle-in-law, and Pebbles&#x27; great-uncle, who is a member of the Texarock Rangers. He constantly holds Fred&#x27;s future inheritance over his head.

===The Rubbles===
* Bernard Matthew &quot;Barney&quot; Rubble – The secondary main character and Fred&#x27;s best friend and next-door neighbor, who is nearly six inches (15 cm) shorter than him and also overweight. His occupation is unknown throughout most of the series, though later episodes depict him working in the same quarry as Fred. He shares many of Fred&#x27;s interests, such as bowling and golf, and is also a member of the Loyal Order of Water Buffaloes. Though Fred and Barney frequently get into feuds with one another, usually due to Fred&#x27;s short temper, they are still close friends.
* Elizabeth Jean &quot;Betty&quot; Rubble – Barney&#x27;s wife and Wilma&#x27;s best friend, who like Wilma has a habit of spending money and is jealous of other women being around her husband.
* Bamm-Bamm Rubble – The Rubbles&#x27; abnormally strong son, whom they adopt during the fourth season. His name comes from the only phrase he speaks as a baby: &quot;Bamm, Bamm!&quot;
* Hoppy – The Rubbles&#x27; pet hopparoo, a hybrid of a kangaroo and a dinosaur whom they purchase at the beginning of the fifth season. When she arrives, Dino and Fred mistake her for a giant mouse and are frightened of her, but they eventually become best friends after Hoppy gets help when they are in an accident. She babysits the kids as she takes them around in her pouch, which also serves as a shopping cart for Betty.

===Other characters===
Over 100 other characters appeared throughout the series. Below are those who have made more than one appearance:

* Mr. George Sylvester Seymour Nathan Oscar Slate – Fred’s hot-tempered boss at the gravel pit, who fires him on several occasions only to give him his job back (and inevitably grant him a raise every time he requests one). A running gag is his ever-changing first name, which has been revealed to be Sylvester, Seymour, Nate, Oscar, and George throughout the series. In the episode &quot;The Long, Long, Long Weekend&quot;, he is shown to be the founder of &quot;Slate Rock and Gravel Company&quot;, which is still in business two million years later and operated by his descendant, &quot;George Slate the Eighty-thousandth&quot;. In early episodes, the more recognized &quot;Mr. Slate&quot; character was known as &quot;Mr. Rockhead&quot; and was a supervisor of Fred, while Mr. Slate was a short character. Over time, the two switched identities and Mr. Slate was phased out.
* Arnold – The Flintstones&#x27; paperboy, whom Fred despises mainly because Arnold is frequently able to best and outsmart him and because he often throws the newspaper in his face. Arnold&#x27;s parents are mentioned in the series, but his mother Doris, who is a friend of Wilma and Betty as shown in the episode &quot;The Little Stranger&quot;, is referenced but never physically appears. Arnold&#x27;s father appears in the episode &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot;, though his name is never mentioned.
* Joe Rockhead – A mutual friend of Fred and Barney, Fred usually mentions doing something with Joe when Fred and Barney have a falling out. Joe was, at some point, the fire chief of the Bedrock Volunteer Fire Department, as shown in the episode &quot;Arthur Quarry&#x27;s Dance Class&quot;. His appearance varied throughout the run of the series, but his appearance in the episode &quot;The Picnic&quot; was his most common appearance.
* Sam Slagheap – The Grand Poobah of the Water Buffalo Lodge.
* The Hatrocks – A family of hillbillies, who feuded with the Flintstones&#x27; Arkanstone branch similarly to the Hatfield–McCoy feud. Fred and Barney reignite a feud with them in &quot;The Bedrock Hillbillies&quot;, when Fred inherits San Cemente from his late great-great-uncle Zeke Flintstone and they fight over who made Zeke&#x27;s portrait. The Hatrocks later return in &quot;The Hatrocks and the Gruesomes&quot;, where they bunk with the Flintstones during their trip to Bedrock World&#x27;s Fair and their antics start to annoy them as they guilt-trip Fred into extending their stay. It is also revealed that they dislike bug music. and the Flintstones, the Rubbles, and the Gruesomes are able to drive them away by performing the Four Insects song &quot;She Said Yeah Yeah Yeah&quot;. After learning that the Bedrock World&#x27;s Fair would feature the Four Insects performing, they fled back to Arkanstone.
** Jethro Hatrock – The patriarch of the Hatrock Family. He had brown hair in &quot;The Hatrocks and the Flintstones&quot; and taupe-gray hair in &quot;The Hatrocks and the Gruesomes&quot;.

** Goblin &quot;Gobby&quot; Gruesome – Weirdly and Creepella&#x27;s son.
** Uncle Ghastly – The uncle of Gobby from Creepella&#x27;s side of the family, who is mostly shown as a large furry hand with claws emerging from a door, a well, or a wall. His shadow was also seen in their debut episode. He wasn&#x27;t named until his second appearance, which is also the only time he is heard speaking, as he is heard laughing from a well.
** Occy – The Gruesome family&#x27;s pet giant octopus.
** Schneider – Gobby&#x27;s pet giant spider.
* The Great Gazoo – An alien from the planet Zetox, who was exiled to Earth and appears in the final season. He helps Fred and Barney with his reality-warping abilities, often against their will. He is actually from the future and is quite dismayed after realizing he has been sent back to &quot;the Stone Age&quot;. He can be seen only by Fred, Barney, Pebbles, Bamm-Bamm, other small children, Dino, and Hoppy.

==Voice-actor details==
Fred Flintstone physically resembles both the first voice actor who played him, Alan Reed, and Jackie Gleason, whose series, &quot;The Honeymooners&quot;, inspired &quot;The Flintstones&quot;. The voice of Barney Rubble was provided by voice actor Mel Blanc, except for five episodes during the second season (the first, second, fifth, sixth, and ninth); Hanna-Barbera regular Daws Butler filled in and provided the voice of Barney while Blanc was incapacitated by a near-fatal car accident in 1961. Blanc was able to return to the series sooner than expected because a temporary recording studio for the cast was set up at his bedside. Blanc&#x27;s Barney voice varied from nasally to deep before the accident, as he and Barbera, who directed the sessions with Alan Dinehart, explored the right level in relation to comedy and other characters. Blanc uses both Barney voices in one of the earliest episodes, &quot;The Prowler.&quot;

Reed was insistent on playing Fred in a relatively natural speaking voice, rather than a broad, &quot;cartoony&quot; style. Few animated short cartoons used this &quot;straightforward&quot; method, except for experimental studios like UPA and feature films with more realistic characters. The performances of Reed and the cast, combined with the writing, helped to ground the animated world of &quot;The Flintstones&quot; in a relatable reality. The dialogue style of &quot;The Flintstones&quot; set a precedent for acting in animation that continues to exist today, and is sometimes falsely attributed in modern animated productions as &quot;revolutionary.&quot;

In a 1986 &quot;Playboy&quot; interview, Gleason said that Reed had done voice-overs for Gleason in his early movies, and that he had considered suing Hanna-Barbera for copying &quot;The Honeymooners&quot;, but decided to let it pass. According to Henry Corden, a voice actor and a friend of Gleason&#x27;s (who would subsequently take over the role of Fred from Reed after his death in 1977), &quot;Jackie&#x27;s lawyers told him he could probably have &quot;The Flintstones&quot; pulled right off the air. But they also told him, &#x27;Do you want to be known as the guy who yanked Fred Flintstone off the air? The guy who took away a show so many kids love and so many parents love, too?&#x27;&quot;

Henry Corden first spoke for Fred Flintstone on the 1965 record album &quot;Songs From Mary Poppins&quot;, then continued doing the voice for most other Flintstone records on the label. Around the same time, Corden was providing Fred&#x27;s singing voice in two films being produced at the studio: the 1966 special &quot;Alice in Wonderland, or What&#x27;s a Nice Kid Like You Doing in a Place Like This?&quot; and the 1966 feature film &quot;The Man Called Flintstone&quot;. Corden assumed the role completely after Reed&#x27;s death in 1977, starting with the TV special, &quot;A Flintstone Christmas&quot;.

Since 2000, Jeff Bergman, James Arnold Taylor, and Scott Innes, who performs both Fred and Barney for Toshiba commercials, have performed the voice of Fred. Since Mel Blanc&#x27;s death in 1989, Barney has been voiced by Jeff Bergman, Frank Welker, Scott Innes, and Kevin Michael Richardson. Various additional character voices were performed by Hal Smith, Allan Melvin, Janet Waldo, Daws Butler, and Howard Morris, among others.

==Episodes==

==Music==

The opening and closing credits theme during the first two seasons was &quot;Rise and Shine&quot;, a lively instrumental underscore accompanying Fred on his drive home from work. . Starting in season three, episode three (&quot;Barney the Invisible&quot;), the opening and closing credits theme was &quot;Meet the Flintstones&quot;. This version was recorded with a 22-piece big band conducted by composer Hoyt Curtin and performed by the Randy Van Horne Singers. The melody is derived from part of the &#x27;B&#x27; section of Beethoven&#x27;s Piano Sonata No. 17 Movement 2, composed in 1801/02. &quot;Meet the Flintstones&quot; was later used in the first two seasons in syndication. The musical underscores were credited to Hoyt Curtin for the show&#x27;s first five seasons; Ted Nichols took over in 1965 for the final season. Many early episodes used the underscores composed for &quot;Top Cat&quot; and &quot;The Jetsons&quot;. Episodes of the last two seasons used the underscore of &quot;Jonny Quest&quot; for the more adventurous stories.

The idea of &quot;The Flintstones&quot; started after Hanna-Barbera produced &quot;The Huckleberry Hound Show&quot; and &quot;The Quick Draw McGraw Show&quot;, which were successful. However, they did not appeal to a wide audience like their previous theatrical cartoon series &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot;, which entertained both children and adults. Since children did not need their parents&#x27; supervision to watch television, Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s programs became labeled &quot;kids only&quot;. Hanna and Barbera wanted to recapture the adult audience with an animated situation comedy.

Hanna and Barbera considered making the two families hillbillies, a theme which was later incorporated into two episodes, &quot;The Bedrock Hillbillies&quot; and &quot;The Hatrocks and the Gruesomes&quot;, ancient Romans, an idea which was later developed into &quot;The Roman Holidays&quot;, pilgrims, and American Indians before deciding on a Stone Age setting. According to Barbera, they settled on the Stone Age because &quot;you could take anything that was current, and convert it to stone-age&quot;. Under the working title &quot;The Flagstones&quot;, a treatment was written by Harry Winkler. The family originally consisted of Fred, Wilma, and their son, Fred, Jr. A brief demonstration film was also created to sell the idea of a &quot;modern stone-age family&quot; to sponsors and the network.

It was a difficult sell, and required eight weeks of daily presentations to networks and ad agencies. June Foray and Hanna-Barbera regular Daws Butler voiced the characters for the demonstration film, but Foray was dropped without warning before production began; Foray was upset about the rejection and refused to work with Hanna-Barbera for many years afterward, despite Barbera&#x27;s efforts to offer her other work. Animator Kenneth Muse, who worked on the &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; cartoons, also worked on the early seasons of &quot;The Flintstones&quot;.

William Hanna was honest about the inspiration, saying, &quot;At that time, &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; was the most popular show on the air, and for my bill, the funniest. The characters, I thought, were terrific. Now, that influenced greatly what we did with &quot;The Flintstones&quot; ... &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; was there, and we used that as a kind of basis for the concept.&quot; Joseph Barbera disavowed these claims in a separate interview, stating, &quot;I don&#x27;t remember mentioning &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; when I sold the show, but if people want to compare &quot;The Flintstones&quot; to &quot;The Honeymooners&quot;, then great. It&#x27;s a total compliment. &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; was one of the greatest shows ever written.&quot;

Jackie Gleason, creator of &quot;The Honeymooners&quot;, considered suing Hanna-Barbera Productions, but decided not to since he did not want to be known as &quot;the guy who yanked Fred Flintstone off the air&quot;. Gleason was sued because &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; was similar to &quot;The Bickersons&quot;, as critics noted at the time, but the lawsuit served by &quot;Bickersons&quot; creator Philip Rapp was ultimately settled out of court. Another influence was noted during Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s tenure at MGM, where they were in a friendly competition with fellow cartoon director Tex Avery. In 1955, Avery directed a cartoon entitled &quot;The First Bad Man&quot;, narrated by cowboy legend Tex Ritter, which was about the rowdy antics of a bank robber in stone-age Dallas. Many sight gags from &quot;The First Bad Man&quot; antedated similar situations used by Hanna-Barbera in &quot;The&quot; &quot;Flintstones&quot; by many years. Therefore, students of American animation call &quot;The First Bad Man&quot; a progenitive seed of &quot;The&quot; &quot;Flintstones&quot;.

The concept was also antedated by the &quot;Stone Age Cartoons&quot;, a series of 12 animated cartoons which Fleischer Studios released from January to September 1940. These cartoons show stone-age people doing modern things with primitive means, such as &quot;Granite Hotel&quot; including characters such as a newsboy, telephone operator, hotel clerk, and a spoof of Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy.

Barbera explained that selling the show to a network and sponsors was not an easy task.

When the series entered production, the working title &quot;The Flagstones&quot; was changed, possibly to avoid confusion with the Flagstons, the main characters in the comic strip &quot;Hi and Lois&quot;. After spending a brief period in development as &quot;The Gladstones&quot; (GLadstone being a Los Angeles telephone exchange at the time), Hanna-Barbera settled upon &quot;The Flintstones&quot;, and the idea of the Flintstones having a child from the start was discarded, with Fred and Wilma starting out as a childless couple. However, some early &quot;Flintstones&quot; merchandise, such as a 1961 Little Golden Book, included &quot;Fred Jr&quot;.

Despite the animation and fantasy setting, the series was initially aimed at adult audiences. This was reflected in the comedy, which resembled the primetime sitcoms of the era, with family issues resolved at the end of each episode, as well as the inclusion of a laugh track. Hanna and Barbera hired many writers from live-action, including two of Jackie Gleason&#x27;s writers, Herbert Finn and Sydney Zelinka, as well as relative newcomer Joanna Lee. However, they still used traditional animation writers, such as Warren Foster and Michael Maltese.

&quot;The Flintstones&quot; premiered on September 30, 1960, at 8:30 pm Eastern time, and quickly became a hit. It was the first American animated show to depict two people of the opposite sex (Fred and Wilma; Barney and Betty) sleeping together in one bed, although Fred and Wilma are sometimes depicted as sleeping in separate beds. The first live-action depiction of this in American TV history was in television&#x27;s first sitcom: 1947&#x27;s &quot;Mary Kay and Johnny.&quot;
The first two seasons were co-sponsored by Winston cigarettes and the characters appeared in several black-and-white television commercials for Winston. This was dictated by the custom, at that time, that the stars of a TV series often &quot;pitched&quot; their sponsor&#x27;s product in an &quot;integrated commercial&quot; at the end of the episode.

During the third season, Hanna and Barbera decided that Fred and Wilma should have a baby. Originally, Hanna and Barbera intended for the Flintstone family to have a boy, but the head of the marketing department convinced them to change it to a girl since &quot;girl dolls sell a lot better than boy dolls&quot;. Although most &quot;Flintstones&quot; episodes were stand-alone storylines, Hanna-Barbera created a story arc surrounding the birth of Pebbles. Beginning with the episode &quot;The Surprise&quot;, aired midway through the third season, in which Wilma reveals her pregnancy to Fred, the arc continued through the time leading up to Pebbles&#x27;s birth in the episode &quot;Dress Rehearsal&quot;, and then continued with several episodes showing Fred and Wilma adjusting to parenthood. Around this time, Winston pulled out their sponsorship and Welch&#x27;s grape juice and grape jellies became the primary sponsor, as the show&#x27;s audience began to shift towards a younger demographic. The integrated commercials for Welch&#x27;s products feature Pebbles asking for grape juice in her toddler dialect, and Fred explaining to Pebbles Welch&#x27;s unique process for making the jelly, compared to the competition. Welch&#x27;s also produced a line of grape jelly packaged in jars that were reusable as drinking glasses, with painted scenes featuring the Flintstones and other characters from the show. In Australia, the Nine Network ran a &quot;Name the Flintstones&#x27; baby&quot; competition during the &#x27;pregnancy&#x27; episodes—few Australian viewers were expected to have a U.S. connection giving them information about past &quot;Flintstone&quot; episodes. An American won the contest and received an all-expenses-paid trip to tour Hanna-Barbera Studios. Another arc occurred in the fourth season, in which the Rubbles, depressed over being unable to have children of their own, adopt Bamm-Bamm. This made &quot;The Flintstones&quot; the first animated series to address the issue of infertility, though subtly. The 100th episode made but the 90th to air, &quot;Little Bamm-Bamm Rubble&quot;, established how Bamm-Bamm was adopted. Nine episodes were produced before it, but aired afterward, which is why Bamm-Bamm was not seen again until episode 101, &quot;Daddies Anonymous&quot;. However, Bamm-Bamm did appear in a teaser in episode 98, &quot;Kleptomaniac Pebbles&quot;. Another story arc, occurring in the final season, centered on Fred and Barney&#x27;s dealings with the Great Gazoo.

After Pebbles&#x27;s birth, the audience demographic expanded and the series was marketed as a family series rather than the &quot;adult&quot; animated show of the earlier seasons. As a result of a wider number of yearly viewers, including children, and competition from TV&#x27;s trend toward fantasy shows, the episodes varied from family comedy to fantasy/adventure, but still had stories about couple dynamics. The last original episode was broadcast on April 1, 1966.

===Broadcast history===

The first three seasons of &quot;The Flintstones&quot; aired Friday nights at 8:30 Eastern time on ABC, with the first two seasons in black-and-white. Beginning with the third season in 1962, ABC televised &quot;The Flintstones&quot; in color, one of the first programs in color to air on it. Despite not being broadcast in color until season 3, &quot;The Flintstones&quot; was produced in color for its entire run. Season four and part of season five aired Thursdays at 7:30, while the rest of the series aired Fridays at 7:30.

In the U.S., &quot;The Flintstones&quot; was part of NBC Saturday mornings from 1966 to 1970, with syndicated reruns offered to local stations until 1997, when E/I regulations and changing tastes in the industry led to the show&#x27;s move to cable television. From the time of Ted Turner&#x27;s purchase of Hanna-Barbera in 1991, TBS, TNT, and Cartoon Network aired the program. On April 1, 2000, the program moved to Boomerang, where it aired until March 6, 2017, but returned to the channel on July 30, 2018. Online, the series was made available on the In2TV service beginning in 2006, then the online version of Kids&#x27; WB until it was discontinued in 2015. As of 2017, full episodes are available in the U.S. on Boomerang&#x27;s subscription video-on-demand service, with select clips made available on the official YouTube account tied to the revamped Kids&#x27; WB website. In 2019, MeTV acquired rerun rights to the series, returning the show to broadcast television for the first time in over 20 years. The first 3 seasons of the series can currently be streamed on Max, a streaming service owned by Warner Bros. Discovery, while the complete series can be found on Tubi, a streaming service owned by Fox Corporation. As of August 1, 2024, the program can also be found on Hulu.

In Canada, &quot;The Flintstones&quot; first aired Monday nights at 9:00 Eastern time on CBC Television until the third season when it moved to the CTV Television Network. At the time, CTV aired the show at different evening time slots throughout its last three seasons. Syndicated reruns were also offered to local stations until the early-1990s. The show was also later carried overtime on YTV, Teletoon Retro, Cartoon Network, and Boomerang, alongside French channels ICI, TQS, TVA, and Prise 2. 

When Independent broadcaster ITV first aired &quot;The Flintstones&quot; to England in January 1961, the program slowly began to spread its popularity around the world. The BBC picked up the rights for the program in 1985. The series was repeated for decades in various daytime and early evening time-slots; episodes were also sometimes used by the BBC in case of last minute schedule changes, such as coverage of sporting events being affected by bad weather. The final BBC broadcast of an episode was in 2008 on BBC Two. Additionally, the series appeared on Cartoon Network in the mid-1990s. Other international networks that aired the original run of the series include RTF in France, ARD in Germany, Rai 1 and Rai 2 in Italy, NTS in the Netherlands, and Fuji TV in Japan.

==Reception==
The night after &quot;The Flintstones&quot; premiered, &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;a pen-and-ink disaster&quot;, and the series was among many that debuted in a &quot;vast wasteland&quot; of a 1960–61 television season considered one of the worst in television history up to that point. As late as the 1980s, highbrow critics derided the show&#x27;s limited animation and derivative plots. Animation historian Michael Barrier disliked the series, calling it a &quot;dumb sitcom&quot; and stated that &quot;I can readily understand why someone who as a small child enjoyed, say, &quot;The Flintstones&quot; might regard that show fondly today. I have a lot more trouble understanding why anyone would try to defend anything about it on artistic grounds.&quot;

Despite the mixed critical reviews following its premiere, &quot;The Flintstones&quot; has generally been considered a television classic and was rerun continuously for five decades after its end. In 1961, &quot;The Flintstones&quot; became the first animated series to be nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series, but lost out to &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot;. In January 2009, IGN named &quot;The Flintstones&quot; as the ninth-best in its &quot;Top 100 Animated TV Shows&quot;. The first season of the series received an approval rating of 100% on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, based on nine reviews, with an average score of 6/10. Currently, several authors consider &quot;The Flintstones&quot; as a cartoon linked to the golden age of American animation.

===Nielsen ratings===
==Films and subsequent television series==
Following the show&#x27;s cancellation in 1966, a film based upon the series was created. &quot;The Man Called Flintstone&quot; was a musical spy caper that parodied James Bond and other secret agents. The movie was released to theaters on August 3, 1966, by Columbia Pictures. It was released on DVD by Warner Home Video in Canada in March 2005 and in United States in December 2008.

The show was revived in the early 1970s with Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm having grown into teenagers, and several different series and made-for-TV movies (broadcast mainly on Saturday mornings, with a few shown in primetime), including a series depicting Fred and Barney as police officers, another depicting the characters as children, and yet others featuring Fred and Barney encountering Marvel Comics superhero The Thing and Al Capp&#x27;s comic strip character The Shmoo—have appeared over the years. The original show also was adapted into a live-action film in 1994, and a prequel, &quot;The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas&quot;, which followed in 2000. Unlike its sister show &quot;The Jetsons&quot; (the two shows appeared in a made-for-TV crossover movie in 1987), the revival programs were not widely syndicated or rerun alongside the original series.

===Canceled Seth MacFarlane reboot===
In 2011, it was announced &quot;Family Guy&quot; creator Seth MacFarlane would be reviving &quot;The Flintstones&quot; for the Fox network, with the first episode airing in 2013. After Fox Entertainment president Kevin Reilly read the pilot script and &quot;liked it but didn&#x27;t love it&quot;, MacFarlane chose to abandon work on the project rather than restarting it.

Concept art of the series was posted on background artist Andy Clark&#x27;s website.

===&quot;Yabba Dabba Dinosaurs&quot;===

&quot;Yabba Dabba Dinosaurs&quot; is an American animated web television series spin-off of &quot;The Flintstones&quot; that premiered in 2020, the first to feature them since they appeared in the 2002 series &quot;The Rubbles&quot;, and produced by Warner Bros. Animation. It was produced by Mark Marek and Marly Halpern-Graser.

Like &quot;Cave Kids&quot;, the show focuses on the lives of best friends Pebbles Flintstone and Bamm-Bamm Rubble, who are joined by Dino for many adventures in the Stone Age. The show was scheduled to be released as a part of the Boomerang IPTV subscription service. On August 19, 2021, it was announced the series would instead be released on HBO Max on September 30, 2021. The series was set to first air on Teletoon as a regular television series in Canada in September 2019, but ended up airing in September 2020.
The show started airing on February 3, 2020, on Boomerang UK.

===Upcoming animated film===
In 2014, it was announced that Warner Bros. was developing an animated film with Chris Henchy, Will Ferrell, and Adam McKay, to write the script for the project. Ferrell and McKay would also be executive producers. In 2018, it was confirmed that the project is still in development and produced by Warner Animation Group, at the time it was unknown if crew members would still be involved with the production. On June 9, 2023, as part of the restructuring of Warner Animation Group, now called Warner Bros. Pictures Animation, it was announced that a new Flintstones movie titled &quot;Meet the Flintstones&quot; was in early development and is meant to be an origin story to the series. The movie will be written by Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic, who both previously directed Illumination&#x27;s &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Movie&quot; and directed by Dreamworks Animation veterans Hamish Grieve and Todd Wilderman.

===Canceled &quot;Bedrock&quot; series===
In 2019, it was reported that a new &quot;Flintstones&quot; reboot series, directed to an adult audience, was in development by Elizabeth Banks and her production company Brownstone Productions. In 2021, the series was now co-produced by Fox Entertainment and Warner Bros. Animation along with Brownstone and received the title &quot;Bedrock&quot;. The series would have take place two decades after the original series with Fred Flintstone on the verge of retirement and a twenty-something Pebbles (voiced by Banks) trying to find her way in life as the Stone Age comes to an end and the Bronze Age arrives. On March 10, 2023, it was reported the series would have also featured the voices of Stephen Root (Fred), Amy Sedaris (Wilma), Joe Lo Truglio (Barney), Nicole Byer (Betty) and Manny Jacinto (Bamm-Bamm). It was also reported that Fox had ordered a pilot presentation of the series which was written by Lindsay Kerns. On July 17, 2024, it was reported that Fox chose to pass on the series.

==Theme parks==
=== United States ===
Opened in 1972, King&#x27;s Island, located in Mason, OH, north of Cincinnati, liberally featuring Hana-Barbera characters and Hana-Barbara Land. On September 22, 2005, Cincinnati&#x27;s News 5 reported that Hana-Barbara Land was leaving the park as it switched to a Nickelodeon theme. 

Bedrock City in Custer, South Dakota opened in the mid-1960s. It closed in 2015 when ownership was transferred, and the new owner could not come to a licensing agreement with Warner Bros. Bedrock City near Williams, Arizona, which opened in 1972, was a spin-off from the same family that owned the South Dakota park.

A &quot;Flintstones&quot;-themed park existed until the 1990s at Carowinds in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Kings Island (near Cincinnati) and Kings Dominion (near Richmond, Virginia) had a Hanna-Barbera land, in which many Hanna-Barbera characters were featured, including the Flintstones, in the early 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s.

=== Canada ===
In Canada, Flintstone Park in Kelowna, British Columbia, opened in 1968 and closed in 1998; it was notable for the &quot;Forty Foot Fred&quot; billboard of Fred Flintstone which was a well-known Kelowna landmark.
Another &quot;Flintstones&quot; park was located in Bridal Falls, British Columbia, which closed in 1990. Calaway Park outside Calgary, Alberta, also opened with a &quot;Flintstones&quot; theme and many of the buildings today have a caveman-like design, though the park no longer licenses the characters. The Canada&#x27;s Wonderland theme park, in Vaughan, Ontario, featured &quot;Flintstones&quot; characters in their Hanna-Barbera-themed children&#x27;s sections from 1985 until the mid-1990s.

=== Other ===
The Australia&#x27;s Wonderland theme park, in Eastern Creek, Sydney, featured &quot;Flintstones&quot; characters in their Hanna-Barbera-themed children&#x27;s sections from 1985 until the mid-1990s.

Bedrock is one of the themed lands in the indoor Warner Bros. World Abu Dhabi park in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, mainly home to the Flintstones Bedrock River Adventure flume ride.

==Live theater==
A stage production opened at Universal Studios Hollywood in 1994 (the year the live-action film was released), developed by Universal and Hanna-Barbera Productions, at the Panasonic Theater, replacing the &quot;Star Trek&quot; show. The story consists of Fred, Wilma, Barney, and Betty heading for &quot;Hollyrock&quot;. The show ran until January 2, 1997.

==In popular culture==
Miles Laboratories (now part of Bayer Corporation) and their One-A-Day vitamin brand was the alternate sponsor of the original &quot;Flintstones&quot; series during its first two seasons, and in the late 1960s, Miles introduced Flintstones Chewable Vitamins, fruit-flavored multivitamin tablets for children in the shape of the Flintstones characters, which are still currently being sold.

&quot;The Simpsons&quot; referenced &quot;The Flintstones&quot; in several episodes. In the episode &quot;Homer&#x27;s Night Out&quot;, Homer&#x27;s local convenience store clerk, Apu, remarks &quot;You look familiar, sir. Are you on the television or something?&quot;, to which Homer replies &quot;Sorry, buddy, you&#x27;ve got me confused with Fred Flintstone.&quot; During the couch gag of the opening credits of the episode &quot;Kamp Krusty&quot;, the Simpson family arrive home to find the Flintstone family already sitting on their couch. The same couch gag was reused in syndicated episodes of &quot;The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show&quot;, when &quot;The Simpsons&quot; overtook &quot;The Flintstones&quot; as the longest-running animated series. In &quot;Lady Bouvier&#x27;s Lover&quot;, Homer&#x27;s boss, Mr. Burns, appears at the family&#x27;s house and says &quot;Why, it&#x27;s Fred Flintstone (referring to Homer) and his lovely wife, Wilma! (Marge) Oh, and this must be little Pebbles! (Maggie) Mind if I come in? I brought chocolates.&quot; Homer responds by saying &quot;Yabba-dabba-doo!&quot; The opening of &quot;Marge vs. the Monorail&quot; depicts Homer leaving work in a similar way to Fred Flintstone in the opening of &quot;The Flintstones&quot;, during which he sings his own version of the latter&#x27;s opening theme only to slam into a chestnut tree.

&quot;Family Guy&quot; also referenced &quot;The Flintstones&quot; in several episodes.

On September 30, 2010, Google temporarily replaced the logo on its search page with a custom graphic celebrating the 50th anniversary of &quot;The Flintstones&quot;″ first TV broadcast.

<doc id="51788" wikidata="Q997481" url="?curid=51788" title="Bubblegum music">
<text>Bubblegum (also called bubblegum pop) is a pop music in a catchy and upbeat style that is marketed for children and adolescents. The term also refers to a more specific rock and pop subgenre, originating in the United States in the late 1960s, that evolved from garage rock, novelty songs, and the Brill Building sound, and which was also defined by its target demographic of preteens and young teenagers. The Archies&#x27; 1969 hit &quot;Sugar, Sugar&quot; was a representative example that led to cartoon rock, a short-lived trend of Saturday-morning cartoon series that heavily featured pop rock songs in the bubblegum vein.

Producer Jeffry Katz claimed credit for coining &quot;bubblegum&quot;, saying that when they discussed their target audience, they decided it was &quot;teenagers, the young kids. And at the time we used to be chewing bubblegum, and my partner and I used to look at it and laugh and say, &#x27;Ah, this is like bubblegum music&#x27;.&quot; The term was then popularized by their boss, Buddah Records label executive Neil Bogart. It became often used as a pejorative for pop music that is perceived to be disposable and contrived. 

Most bubblegum acts were one-hit wonders (notable exceptions included The Cowsills, the Partridge Family and Tommy Roe) and the sound remained a significant commercial force until the early 1970s. Commentators often debate the scope of the genre and have variously argued for the exclusion or inclusion of dance-pop, disco, teen pop, boy bands, and especially the Monkees. During the 1970s, the original bubblegum sound was a formative influence on punk rock, new wave, and melodic metal.

==Definitions==

Occasionally invoked as a pejorative, the &quot;bubblegum&quot; descriptor has several different applications. The 2001 book &quot;Bubblegum Music Is the Naked Truth&quot; rules out teen pop or boy bands as inherently bubblegum and defines the term as:

# &quot;the classic bubblegum era from 1967–1972&quot;
# &quot;disposable pop music&quot;
# &quot;pop music contrived and marketed to appeal to pre-teens&quot;
# &quot;pop music produced in an assembly-line process, driven by producers and using faceless singers&quot;
# &quot;pop music with that intangible, upbeat &#x27;bubblegum&#x27; sound.&quot;

The artists were typically singles acts, with songs commonly featuring sing-along choruses, seemingly childlike themes and a contrived innocence, occasionally combined with an undercurrent of sexual double entendre. Comparing bubblegum to power pop, &quot;Mojo&quot; writer Dawn Eden said: &quot;Power pop aims for your heart and your feet. Bubblegum aims for any part of your body it can get, as long as you buy the damn record.&quot; Music critic Lester Bangs described the style as &quot;the basic sound of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll – minus the rage, fear, violence and anomie&quot;.

There is debate concerning which artists fit the genre, especially for cases such as the Monkees. In the opinion of music historian Bill Pitzonka: &quot;The whole thing that really makes a record bubblegum is just an inherently contrived innocence that somehow transcends that. [...] It has to sound like they mean it.&quot; Music critic David Smay argued that disco is merely bubblegum by another name and that since bubblegum is &quot;dance music for pre-teen girls&quot;, the genre&#x27;s scope must therefore include dance-pop and such associated figures as Stock Aitken Waterman and Kylie Minogue, but &quot;Not all dance-pop is aimed at kids and shouldn&#x27;t be presumed to be disposable anymore than bubblegum.&quot;

==Precursors==
According to music historian Carl Caferelli, &quot;You could conceivably think of virtually every cute novelty hit, from pre-rock ditties like &quot;How Much Is That Doggie In The Window&quot; to transcendent rock-era staples like &quot;Iko Iko,&quot; as a legitimate precursor to bubblegum&#x27;s avowedly ephemeral themes.&quot; He went on to list such &quot;important antecedents&quot; as &quot;I&#x27;m Henery the Eighth, I Am&quot; (Herman&#x27;s Hermits, 1965), &quot;Snoopy Vs. The Red Baron&quot; (Royal Guardsmen, 1966), &quot;Ding, Dong! The Witch is Dead&quot; (The Fifth Estate, 1967), and &quot;Green Tambourine&quot; (Lemon Pipers, 1967).

==Original commercial peak (1968–1972)==

Bubblegum is generally traced to the success of the 1968 songs &quot;Simon Says&quot; by the 1910 Fruitgum Company and &quot;Yummy Yummy Yummy&quot; by the Ohio Express. Tommy James of the Shondells claims to have unknowingly invented bubblegum music in 1967 with the hit song &quot;I Think We&#x27;re Alone Now&quot;. Producers Jerry Kasenetz and Jeffry Katz have claimed credit for coining &quot;bubblegum&quot; for this music, saying that when they discussed their target audience, they decided it was &quot;teenagers, the young kids. And at the time we used to be chewing bubblegum, and my partner and I used to look at it and laugh and say, &#x27;Ah, this is like bubblegum music&#x27;.&quot; The term was seized upon by Buddah Records label executive Neil Bogart, as Pitzonka added: &quot;Kasenetz and Katz really crystallized [the scene] when they came up with the term themselves and that nice little analogy. And Neil Bogart, being the marketing person he was, just crammed it down the throats of people. That&#x27;s really the point at which bubblegum took off.&quot;

The Archies&#x27; &quot;Sugar, Sugar&quot; became the best-selling hit of 1969 and inspired a wave of artists to adopt the bubblegum style. The song&#x27;s success led to &quot;cartoon rock&quot;, a short-lived trend of Saturday morning cartoon series that heavily featured pop-rock songs in the bubblegum vein. However, none of these songs had showings on the pop charts when released as singles, except for a record early in the year, &quot;The Banana Splits&quot; theme song &quot;The Tra La La Song (One Banana, Two Banana)&quot;, which managed a number 96 peak on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 100 and number 94 on the RPM charts.

Robin Carmody of &quot;Freaky Trigger&quot; writes that British bubblegum from 1968 to 1972 was distinct from the &quot;more worldly and sophisticated American equivalent&quot; by being &quot;simplistic, childish, over-excited, innocent, full of absolute certainties and safe knowledges&quot;, while noting that it &quot;essentially bridged the gap between the poppier end of the mid-60s beat boom and glam rock&quot;.

==1970s hits and influence==
Most bubblegum acts were one hit wonders (notable exceptions included the Partridge Family and Tommy Roe) and the genre remained a significant commercial force until the early 1970s. Bubblegum failed to maintain its chart presence after the early 1970s due in part to changing trends in the industry. Producers such as Kasenetz and Katz subsequently pursued different musical avenues. Writing in &quot;Bubblegum Music Is the Naked Truth&quot;, Chuck Eddy offered that bubblegum evolved to be &quot;more an attitude than a genre&quot; during the 1970s. In the UK, bubblegum caught on in the early 1970s and fell out of popular favor by the end of the decade. In 2010, author and musician Bob Stanley summarized: 

Many musicians who grew up with the genre later incorporated bubblegum influences in their work. Although it is rarely acknowledged by music critics, who typically dismissed the genre, bubblegum&#x27;s simple song structures, upbeat tempos, and catchy hooks were carried into punk rock. The Ramones were the most prominent of the bubblegum-influenced punk bands, adopting cartoon personae and later covering two bubblegum standards &quot;Little Bit O&#x27; Soul&quot; and &quot;Indian Giver&quot;. Pitzonka stated of bubblegum&#x27;s legacy:
==Bubblegum dance==
The term &quot;bubblegum dance&quot; has sometimes been used to describe music. The 1971 Osmonds song &quot;One Bad Apple&quot; is an early example, modeled after the style of the Jackson 5. Another example is Danish-based Eurodance being labeled as such, most notably &quot;Barbie Girl&quot; from Aqua.

<text>E.164 is an international standard (ITU-T Recommendation), titled &quot;The international public telecommunication numbering plan&quot;, that defines a numbering plan for the worldwide public switched telephone network (PSTN) and some other data networks.

E.164 defines a general format for international telephone numbers. Plan-conforming telephone numbers are limited to only digits and to a maximum of fifteen digits. The specification divides the digit string into a country code of one to three digits, and the subscriber telephone number of a maximum of twelve digits.

Alternative formats (with area codes and country specific numbers) are available. Any country-specific international call prefixes are not contained in the specification.

The title of the original version and first revision of the E.164 standard was &quot;Numbering Plan for the ISDN Era&quot;

==Recommendations==
===E.163===
E.163 was the former ITU-T recommendation for describing telephone numbers for the public switched telephone network (PSTN). In the United States, this was formerly referred to as a &quot;directory number&quot;. E.163 was withdrawn, and some recommendations were incorporated into revision 1 of E.164 in 1997.

===E.164.1===
This recommendation describes the procedures and criteria for the reservation, assignment, and reclamation of E.164 country codes and associated &quot;identification code&quot; (IC) assignments. The criteria and procedures are provided as a basis for the effective and efficient utilization of the available E.164 numbering resources.

===E.164.2===
This recommendation contains the criteria and procedures for an applicant to be temporarily assigned a three-digit identification code within the shared E.164 country code +991 for the purpose of conducting an international non-commercial trial.

===E.164.3===
This recommendation describes the principles, criteria, and procedures for the assignment and reclamation of resources within a shared E.164 country code for groups of countries. These shared country codes will coexist with all other E.164-based country codes assigned by the ITU. The resource of the shared country code consists of a &quot;country code&quot; and a &quot;group identification code&quot; (CC + GIC) and provides the capability for a group of countries to provide telecommunication services within the group. The Secretariat of the ITU Standardization Sector (ITU-T), the Telecommunication Standardization Bureau (TSB) is responsible for the assignment of the CC + GIC.

==Numbering formats==
The E.164 recommendation provides the telephone number structure and functionality for five categories of telephone numbers used in international public telecommunications.

For each of the categories, it details the components of the numbering structure and the digit analysis required for successful routing of calls. Annex A provides additional information on the structure and function of E.164 numbers. Annex B provides information on network identification, service parameters, calling/connected line identity, dialing procedures, and addressing for Geographic-based ISDN calls. Specific E.164-based applications which differ in usage are defined in separate recommendations.

The number categories are all based on a fifteen-digit numbering space. Before 1997, only twelve digits were allowed. The definition does not include any international call prefixes, necessary for a call to reach international circuits from inside the country of call origination.

==Uses of E.164 numbers==
E.164 numbers were originally defined for use in the worldwide public switched telephone network (PSTN). The early PSTN collected routing digits from users (e.g. on a dial pad), signaled those digits to each telephony switch, and used the numbers to determine how to ultimately reach the called party.

ITU-T E.123 entitled &quot;Notation for national and international telephone numbers, e-mail addresses and web addresses&quot; provides guidance when printing E.164 telephone numbers. This format includes the recommendation of prefixing international telephone numbers with a plus sign (+) and using only spaces for digit grouping.

The presentation of a telephone number with the plus sign (+) indicates that the number should be dialed with an international calling prefix, in place of the plus sign. The number is presented starting the country calling code. This is called the &quot;globalized&quot; format of an E.164 number, and is defined in the Internet Engineering Task Force . The international calling prefix is a trunk code to reach an international circuit in the country of call origination.

===DNS Mapping of E.164 numbers===

Some national telephone administrations and telephone companies have implemented an Internet-based database for their numbering spaces. E.164 numbers may be registered in the Domain Name System (DNS) of the Internet in which the second-level domain e164.arpa has been reserved for telephone number mapping (ENUM). In the system, any telephone number may be mapped into a domain name using a reverse sequence of subdomains for each digit. For example, the telephone number translates to the domain name . When a number is mapped, a DNS query may be used to locate the service facilities on the Internet that accept and process telephone calls to the owner of record of the number, using, for example, the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), a call-signaling VoIP protocol whose SIP addresses are similar in format (user@domain...) to e-mail addresses. This allows a direct, end-to-end Internet connection without passing through the public switched telephone network.

<text>James Arthur Gosling (born 19 May 1955) is a Canadian computer scientist, best known as the founder and lead designer behind the Java programming language.

Gosling was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 2004 for the conception and development of the architecture for the Java programming language and for contributions to window systems.

== Early life ==
Gosling was born in Calgary, Alberta, to Joyce Morrison and Dave Gosling. He is of English, Welsh, Scottish, and Icelandic descent. Gosling attended William Aberhart High School. While in high school, he wrote some of the software to analyze data from the ISIS 2 satellite, working for the University of Calgary physics department. He received a Bachelor of Science from the University of Calgary and his M.A. and Ph.D. from Carnegie Mellon University, all in computer science. He wrote a version of Emacs called Gosling Emacs (Gosmacs) while working toward his doctorate. He built a multi-processor version of Unix for a 16-way computer system while at Carnegie Mellon University, before joining Sun Microsystems. He also developed several compilers and mail systems there.
Gosling has two children, Katie and Kelsey, who are half siblings from his two marriages.

==Career and contributions==
Gosling was with Sun Microsystems between 1984 and 2010 (26 years). At Sun he invented an early Unix windowing system called NeWS, which became a lesser-used alternative to the still used X Window System, because Sun did not give it an open source license.

He is known as the father of the Java programming language. He got the idea for the Java VM while writing a program to port software from a PERQ by translating Perq Q-Code to VAX assembler and emulating the hardware. He is generally credited with having invented the Java programming language in 1994.
He created the original design of Java and implemented the language&#x27;s original compiler and virtual machine. Gosling traces the origins of the approach to his early graduate student days, when he created a p-code virtual machine for the lab&#x27;s DEC VAX computer, so that his professor could run programs written in UCSD Pascal. In the work leading to Java at Sun, he saw that architecture-neutral execution for widely distributed programs could be achieved by implementing a similar philosophy: always program for the same virtual machine.

Another contribution of Gosling&#x27;s was co-writing the &quot;bundle&quot; program, known as &quot;shar&quot;, a utility thoroughly detailed in Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike&#x27;s book &quot;The Unix Programming Environment&quot;.

He left Sun Microsystems on April 2, 2010, after it was acquired by the Oracle Corporation, citing reductions in pay, status, and decision-making ability, along with change of role and ethical challenges. He has since taken a very critical stance towards Oracle in interviews, noting that &quot;during the integration meetings between Sun and Oracle, where we were being grilled about the patent situation between Sun and Google, we could see the Oracle lawyer&#x27;s eyes sparkle.&quot; He clarified his position during the &quot;Oracle v. Google&quot; trial over Android: &quot;While I have differences with Oracle, in this case they are in the right. Google totally slimed Sun. We were all really disturbed, even Jonathan [Schwartz]: he just decided to put on a happy face and tried to turn lemons into lemonade, which annoyed a lot of folks at Sun.&quot; However, he approved of the court&#x27;s ruling that APIs should not be copyrightable.

In March 2011, Gosling joined Google. Six months later, he followed his colleague Bill Vass and joined a startup called Liquid Robotics. In late 2016, Liquid Robotics was acquired by Boeing. Following the acquisition, Gosling left Liquid Robotics to work at Amazon Web Services as Distinguished Engineer in May 2017. He retired in July 2024.

He is an advisor at the Scala company Lightbend, Independent Director at Jelastic, and Strategic Advisor for Eucalyptus, and is a board member of DIRTT Environmental Solutions.

<text>David Neil Cutler Sr. (born March 13, 1942) is an American software engineer. He developed several computer operating systems, namely Microsoft Windows NT, and Digital Equipment Corporation&#x27;s RSX-11M, VAXELN, and VMS.

== Personal history ==
Cutler was born in Lansing, Michigan and grew up in DeWitt, Michigan. After graduating from Olivet College, Michigan, in 1965, he went to work for DuPont.

Cutler holds at least 20 patents, and is affiliate faculty in the Computer Science Department at the University of Washington.

Cutler is an avid auto racing driver. He competed in the Atlantic Championship from 1996 to 2002, scoring a career best of 8th on the Milwaukee Mile in 2000.

Cutler was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 1994 for the design and engineering of commercially successful operating systems.

Cutler is a member of Adelphic Alpha Pi Fraternity at Olivet College, Michigan.

==DuPont (1965 to 1971)==
Cutler&#x27;s first exposure to computers came when he was tasked to perform a computer simulations model for one of DuPont&#x27;s customers using IBM&#x27;s GPSS-3 language on an IBM model 7044. This work led to an interest in how computers and their operating systems worked.

==Digital Equipment Corporation (1971 to 1988)==
Cutler left DuPont to pursue his interest in computer systems, beginning with Digital Equipment Corporation in 1971. He worked at Digital&#x27;s headquarters in Maynard, Massachusetts.

=== RSX-11M ===

=== VMS ===

In April 1975, DEC began a hardware project, code-named Star, to design a 32-bit virtual address extension to its PDP-11. In June 1975, Cutler, together with Dick Hustvedt and Peter Lipman, were appointed the technical project leaders for the software project, code-named Starlet, to develop a totally new operating system for the Star family of processors. These two projects were tightly integrated from the beginning.

The three technical leaders of the Starlet project together with three technical leaders of the Star project formed the &quot;Blue Ribbon Committee&quot; at DEC that produced the fifth design evolution for the programs. The design featured simplifications to the memory management and process scheduling schemes of the earlier proposals and the architecture was accepted. The Star and Starlet projects culminated in the development of the VAX-11/780 superminicomputer and the VAX/VMS operating system, respectively.

=== PRISM and MICA projects ===

DEC began working on a new CPU using reduced instruction set computer (RISC) design principles in 1986. Cutler, who was working in DEC&#x27;s DECwest facility in Bellevue, Washington, was selected to head PRISM, a project to develop the company&#x27;s RISC machine. Its operating system, code named MICA, was to embody the next generation of design principles and have a compatibility layer for Unix and VMS. The RISC machine was to be based on emitter-coupled logic (ECL) technology, and was one of three ECL projects DEC was undertaking at the time.

Funding the research and development of multiple ECL projects yielding products that would ultimately compete against each other was a strain. Of the three ECL projects, the VAX 9000 was the only one that was directly commercialized. Primarily because of the early successes of the PMAX advanced development project and the need for differing business models, PRISM was canceled in 1988 in favor of PMAX.

PRISM later surfaced as the basis of DEC&#x27;s Alpha family of computer systems.

=== Attitude towards Unix ===
Cutler is known for his disdain for Unix. Said one team member who worked with Cutler:
==Microsoft (1988 – present)==

=== Microsoft Windows NT ===
Cutler left DEC for Microsoft in October 1988 and led the development of Windows NT. Later, he worked on targeting Windows NT to DEC&#x27;s 64-bit Alpha architecture then on Windows 2000. After the demise of Windows on Alpha (and the demise of DEC), he was instrumental in porting Windows to AMD&#x27;s new 64-bit AMD64 architecture. He was involved with the Windows XP Pro x64 and Windows Server 2003 SP1 x64 releases. He moved to working on Microsoft&#x27;s Live Platform in August 2006. Cutler was awarded the prestigious status of Senior Technical Fellow at Microsoft.

=== Microsoft Windows Azure ===
At the 2008 Professional Developers Conference, Microsoft announced Azure Services Platform, a cloud-based operating system which Microsoft is developing. During the conference keynote, Cutler was mentioned as a lead developer on the project, along with Amitabh Srivastava.

=== Microsoft Xbox ===
In January 2012, a spokesperson for Microsoft confirmed that Cutler was no longer working on Windows Azure, and had joined the Xbox team. In May 2013, Microsoft announced the Xbox One console, and Cutler was mentioned as having worked in developing the host OS of the new gaming device. Apparently his work was focused on creating an optimized version of Microsoft&#x27;s Hyper-V Host OS specifically designed for Xbox One.

== Awards ==

* Recognized as a 2007 National Medal of Technology and Innovation Laureate, awarded on 29 September 2008 at a White House ceremony in Washington, DC.
* Honored as a Computer History Museum Fellow on 16 April 2016 at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California.

<doc id="51794" wikidata="Q357527" url="?curid=51794" title="Side-scan sonar">
<text>Side-scan sonar (also sometimes called side scan sonar, sidescan sonar, side imaging sonar, side-imaging sonar and bottom classification sonar) is a category of sonar system that is used to efficiently create an image of large areas of the sea floor.

==Uses==
Side scan sonar is used to image large areas of the seafloor quickly. Applications include surveys for marine archaeology, shipwreck hunting, search and recovery (SAR), and environmental monitoring. In conjunction with seafloor samples, it is able to provide an understanding of the differences in material and texture type of the seabed. Side-scan sonar imagery is also a commonly used tool to detect debris items and other obstructions on the seafloor that may be hazardous to shipping or to seafloor installations by the oil and gas industry. In addition, the status of pipelines and cables on the seafloor can be investigated using side-scan sonar. Side-scan data are frequently acquired along with bathymetric soundings and sub-bottom profiler data, thus providing a glimpse of the shallow structure of the seabed. Side-scan sonar is also used for fisheries research, dredging operations and environmental studies. It also has military applications including mine detection.

==How it works==
Side-scan uses a sonar device that emits conical or fan-shaped pulses down toward the seafloor across a wide angle perpendicular to the path of the sensor through the water, which may be towed from a surface vessel or submarine (called a “towfish”), or mounted on the ship&#x27;s hull. The intensity of the acoustic reflections from the seafloor of this fan-shaped beam is recorded in a series of cross-track slices. When stitched together along the direction of motion, these slices form an image of the sea bottom within the swath (coverage width) of the beam. The sound frequencies used in side-scan sonar usually range from 100 to 500 kHz; higher frequencies yield better resolution but less range.

==History==

===Technology===
The earliest side-scan sonars used a single conical-beam transducer. Next, units were made with two transducers to cover both sides. The transducers were either contained in one hull-mounted package or with two packages on either side of the vessel. Next the transducers evolved to fan-shaped beams to produce a better &quot;sonogram&quot; or sonar image. In order to get closer to the bottom in deep water the side-scan transducers were placed in a &quot;tow fish&quot; and pulled by a tow cable.

Up until the mid-1980s, commercial side scan images were produced on paper records. The early paper records were produced with a sweeping plotter that burned the image into a scrolling paper record. Later plotters allowed for the simultaneous plotting of position and ship motion information onto the paper record. In the late 1980s, commercial systems using the newer, cheaper computer systems developed digital scan-converters that could mimic more cheaply the analog scan converters used by the military systems to produce TV and computer displayed images of the scan, and store them on video tape. Currently data is stored on computer hard drives or solid-state media - the data is typically displayed in grayscale or color images, known as side scan sonograms, which provide a visual representation of the underwater environment. 

===Military application===
One of the inventors of side-scan sonar was German scientist, Dr. Julius Hagemann, who was brought to the US after World War II and worked at the US Navy Mine Defense Laboratory, Panama City, FL from 1947 until his death in 1964. His work is documented in US Patent 4,197,591 which was first disclosed in Aug 1958, but remained classified by the US Navy until it was finally issued in 1980. Experimental side-scan sonar systems were made during the 1950s in laboratories including Scripps Institution of Oceanography and Hudson Laboratories and by Dr. Harold Edgerton at MIT.

Military side-scan sonars were made in the 1950s by Westinghouse. Advanced systems were later developed and built for special military purposes, such as to find H-Bombs lost at sea or to find a lost Russian submarine, at the Westinghouse facility in Annapolis up through the 1990s. This group also produced the first and only working &quot;Angle Look Sonar&quot; that could trace objects while looking under the vehicle.

===Commercial application===

The first commercial side-scan system was the Kelvin Hughes &quot;Transit Sonar&quot;, a converted echo-sounder with a single-channel, pole-mounted, fan-beam transducer introduced around 1960. In 1963 Dr. Harold Edgerton, Edward Curley, and John Yules used a conical-beam 12 kHz side-scan sonar to find the sunken Vineyard Lightship in Buzzards Bay, Massachusetts. A team led by Martin Klein at Edgerton, Germeshausen &amp; Grier (later E.G. &amp; G., Inc.) developed the first successful towed, dual-channel commercial side-scan sonar system from 1963 to 1966. Martin Klein is generally considered to be the &quot;father&quot; of commercial side-scan sonar. In 1967, Edgerton used Klein&#x27;s sonar to help Alexander McKee find Henry VIII&#x27;s flagship &quot;Mary Rose&quot;. That same year Klein used the sonar to help archaeologist George Bass find a 2000-year-old ship off the coast of Turkey. In 1968 Klein founded Klein Associates (now KLEIN - A MIND Technology Business) and continued to work on improvements including the first commercial high frequency (500 kHz) systems and the first dual-frequency side-scan sonars, and the first combined side-scan and sub-bottom profiling sonar. In 1985, Charles Mazel of Klein Associates (now Klein Marine Systems, Inc.) produced the first commercial side-scan sonar training videos and the first &quot;Side Scan Sonar Training Manual&quot; and two oceanographers found the wreck of the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;.

For surveying large areas, the GLORIA sidescan sonar was developed by Marconi Underwater Systems and the Institute of Oceanographic Sciences (IOS) for NERC. GLORIA stands for Geological Long Range Inclined Asdic. It was used by the US Geological Survey and the IOS in the UK to obtain images of continental shelves worldwide. It operated at relatively low frequencies to obtain long range. Like most side-scan sonars, the GLORIA instrument is towed behind a ship. GLORIA has a ping rate of two per minute, and detects returns from a range of up to 22 km either side of the sonar fish.

<text>Underwater archaeology is archaeology practiced underwater. As with all other branches of archaeology, it evolved from its roots in pre-history and in the classical era to include sites from the historical and industrial eras. 

Its acceptance has been a relatively late development due to the difficulties of accessing and working underwater sites, and because the application of archaeology to underwater sites initially emerged from the skills and tools developed by shipwreck salvagers. As a result, underwater archaeology initially struggled to establish itself as actual archaeological research. This changed when universities began teaching the subject and a theoretical and practical base for the sub-discipline was firmly established in the late 1980s. 

Underwater archaeology now has a number of branches including, maritime archaeology: the scientifically based study of past human life, behaviors and cultures and their activities in, on, around and (lately) under the sea, estuaries and rivers. This is most often effected using the physical remains found in, around or under salt or fresh water or buried beneath water-logged sediment. In recent years, the study of submerged WWII sites and of submerged aircraft in the form of underwater aviation archaeology have also emerged as bona fide activity.

Though often mistaken as such, underwater archaeology is not restricted to the study of shipwrecks. Changes in sea level because of local seismic events such as the earthquakes that devastated Port Royal and Alexandria or more widespread climatic changes on a continental scale mean that some sites of human occupation that were once on dry land are now submerged. At the end of the last ice age, the North Sea was a great plain, and anthropological material, as well as the remains of animals such as mammoths, are sometimes recovered by trawlers. Also, because human societies have always made use of water, sometimes the remains of structures that these societies built underwater still exist (such as the foundations of crannogs, bridges and harbors) when traces on dry land have been lost. As a result, underwater archaeological sites cover a vast range including: submerged indigenous sites and places where people once lived or visited that have been subsequently covered by water due to rising sea levels; wells, cenotes, wrecks (shipwrecks; aircraft); the remains of structures created in water (such as crannogs, bridges or harbors); other port-related structures; refuse or debris sites where people disposed of their waste, garbage and other items, such as ships, aircraft, munitions and machinery, by dumping into the water.

Underwater archaeology is often complementary to archaeological research on terrestrial sites because the two are often linked by many and various elements including geographic, social, political, economic and other considerations. As a result, a study of an archaeological landscape can involve a multidisciplinary approach requiring the inclusion of many specialists from a variety of disciplines including prehistory, historical archaeology, maritime archaeology, and anthropology. There are many examples. One is the wreck of the VOC ship &quot;Zuytdorp&quot; lost in 1711 on the coast of Western Australia, where there remains considerable speculation that some of the crew survived and, after establishing themselves on shore, intermixed with indigenous tribes from the area. The archaeological signature at this site also now extends into the interaction between indigenous people and the European pastoralists who entered the area in the mid-19th century.

== Research potential ==
There are many reasons why underwater archaeology can make a significant contribution to our knowledge of the past. In the shipwreck field alone, individual shipwrecks can be of significant historical importance either because of the magnitude of loss of life (such as the &quot;Titanic&quot;) or circumstances of loss (&quot;Housatonic&quot; was the first vessel in history sunk by an enemy submarine). Shipwrecks such as &quot;Mary Rose&quot; can also be important for archaeology because they can form a kind of accidental time capsule, preserving an assemblage of human artifacts at the moment in time when the ship was lost.

Sometimes it is not the wrecking of the ship that is important, but the fact that we have access to the remains of it, especially where the vessel was of major importance and significance in the history of science and engineering (or warfare), due to being the first of its type of vessel. The development of submarines, for example, can be traced via underwater archaeological research, via the &quot;Hunley&quot;, which was the first submarine to sink an enemy ship (&quot;Hunley&quot; also had unique construction details not found in previous vessels and was one of the few historic warships ever raised intact); the &quot;Resurgam&quot; &quot;II&quot;, the first powered submarine; and &quot;Holland 5&quot;, which provides insight into the development of submarines in the British Navy.

== UNESCO Convention ==
All traces of human existence underwater which are one hundred years old or more are protected by the UNESCO Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage. This convention aims at preventing the destruction or loss of historic and cultural information and looting. It helps states parties to protect their underwater cultural heritage with an international legal framework.
On the basis of the recommendations defined in the above-mentioned UNESCO Convention various European projects have been funded such as the CoMAS project
for in situ conservation planning of underwater archaeological artefacts.

== Challenges ==
Underwater sites are inevitably difficult to access, and more hazardous, compared with working on dry land. In order to access the site directly, diving equipment and diving skills are necessary. The depths that can be accessed by divers, and the length of time available at depths, are limited. For deep sites beyond the reach of divers, submarines or remote sensing equipment are needed.

For a marine site, while some form of working platform (typically a boat or ship) is often needed, shore-based activities are common. Notwithstanding, underwater archaeology is a field plagued by logistics problems. A working platform for underwater archaeology needs to be equipped to provide for the delivery of air for example, recompression and medical facilities, or specialist remote sensing equipment, analysis of archaeological results, support for activities being undertaken in the water, storage of supplies, facilities for conservation for any items recovered from the water, as well as accommodation for workers. Equipment used for archaeological investigation, including water dredge and airlifts create additional hazards and logistics issues. Moreover, marine sites may be subject to strong tidal flows or poor weather which mean that the site is only accessible for a limited amount of time. Some marine creatures also pose a threat to diver safety.

Underwater sites are often dynamic, that is they are subject to movement by currents, surf, storm damage or tidal flows. Structures may be unexpectedly uncovered, or buried beneath sediments. Over time, exposed structures will be eroded, broken up and scattered. The dynamic nature of the environment may make in-situ conservation infeasible, especially as exposed organics, such as the wood of a shipwreck, are likely to be consumed by marine organisms such as piddocks. In addition, underwater sites can be chemically active, with the result that iron can be leached from metal structures to form concretions. The original metal will then be left in a fragile state. Artifacts recovered from underwater sites need special care.

Visibility may be poor, because of sediments or algae in the water and lack of light penetration. This means that survey techniques that work well on land (such as triangulation), generally can not be used effectively under water.

In addition it can be difficult to allow access to the results of the archaeological research as underwater sites do not provide good outreach possibilities or access for the general public. Work has been done to bridge this difficulty through the use of the World Wide Web for webcasting projects, or dedicated virtual reality systems that allow users to perform a virtual diving into an interactive 3D reconstruction of the underwater archaeological site. An example is the excavation of the &quot;Queen Anne&#x27;s Revenge&quot; and the &quot;QAR DiveLive&quot; program, a live interactive virtual field trip to the wrecksite.

== Techniques ==

Although specialized techniques and tools have been developed to address the challenges of working under water, the archaeological goals and process are essentially the same as in any other context. Investigating an underwater site however, is likely to take longer and be more costly than an equivalent terrestrial one.

An important aspect of project design is likely to be managing the logistics of operating from a boat and of managing diving operations. The depth of water over the site, and whether access is constrained by tides, currents and adverse weather conditions will create substantial constraints on the techniques that can feasibly be used and the amount of investigation that can be carried out for a given cost or in a set timescale. Many of the most carefully investigated sites, including the &quot;Mary Rose&quot; have relied substantially on avocational archaeologists working over a considerable period of time.

As with archaeology on land, some techniques are essentially manual, using simple equipment (generally relying on the efforts of one or more scuba divers), while others use advanced technology and more complex logistics (for example requiring a large support vessel, with equipment handling cranes, underwater communication and computer visualization).

=== Position fixing ===
Knowing the location of an archaeological site is fundamental to being able to study it. In the open sea there are no landmarks, so position fixing is generally achieved using GPS. Historically, sites within sight of the shore would have been located using transects. A site may also be located by visually surveying some form of marker (such as a buoy) from two known (mapped) points on land. The depth of water at a site can be determined from charts or by using the depth sounding sonar equipment that is standard equipment on ships. Such sonar can often be used to locate an upstanding structure, such as a shipwreck, once GPS has placed the research vessel in approximately the right location.

=== Site survey ===

The type of survey required depends on the information that is needed to resolve archaeological questions, but most sites will need at least some form of topographical survey and a site plan showing the locations of artifacts and other archaeological material, where samples were taken and where different types of archaeological investigation were carried out. Environmental assessment of archaeological sites will also require that environmental conditions (water chemistry, dynamic properties) as well as the natural organisms present on the site are recorded. For shipwrecks, particularly post-industrial age shipwrecks, pollution threats from wreck material may need to be investigated and recorded.

The simplest approach to survey is to carry out three-dimensional surveying by divers using depth gauges and tape measurements. Research shows that such measurements are typically less accurate than similar surveys on land. Where it is not practical or safe for divers to physically visit a site, Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) enable observation and intervention with control by personnel located at the surface. The low technology approach of measuring using tape measures and depth gauges can be replaced with a more accurate and quicker high technology approach using acoustic positioning. ROV technology was used during the &quot;Mardi Gras&quot; Shipwreck Project. The &quot;Mardi Gras Shipwreck&quot; sank some 200 years ago about 35 miles off the coast of Louisiana in the Gulf of Mexico in of water.

Remote sensing or Marine Geophysics is generally carried out using equipment towed from a vessel on the surface and therefore does not require any one, or any equipment to actually penetrate to the full depth of the site. Sensitive sonar, especially side-scan sonar or multi-beam sonar may be used to image an underwater site. Magnetometry can be used to locate metal remains such as metal shipwrecks, anchors and cannon. Sub-bottom profiling utilizes sonar to detect structures buried beneath sediment.

=== Recording ===

A variety of techniques are available to divers to record findings underwater. Scale drawing is the basic tool of archaeology and can be undertaken underwater. Pencils will write underwater on permatrace, plastic dive slates, or matt laminated paper.

Photography and videography are the mainstays of recording, which has become much more convenient with the advent of reasonably priced digital still and HD video cameras. Cameras, including video cameras can be provided with special underwater housings that enable them to be used for underwater videography. Low visibility underwater and distortion of image due to refraction mean that perspective photographs can be difficult to obtain. However, it is possible to take a series of photographs at adjacent points and then combined into a single photomontage or photomosaic image of the whole site. 3D photogrammetry has also become a very popular way to image underwater cultural materials and shipwreck sites.

=== Excavation ===
Where intrusive underwater excavation is appropriate, silts and sediments can be removed from an area of investigation using a water dredge or airlift. When used correctly, these devices have an additional benefit in tending to improve the visibility in the immediate vicinity of the investigation. For very deep sea excavation manned and unmanned submersibles are sometimes used to view sites. Underwater photography and sonar imaging can also be conducted from these platforms which assists the recording process.

=== Archaeological science ===
A variety of archaeological sciences are used in underwater archaeology. Dendrochronology is an important technique especially for dating the timbers of wooden ships. It may also provide additional information, including the area where the timber was harvested (i.e. likely to be where the ship was built) and whether or not there are later repairs or reuse of salvaged materials. Because plant and animal material can be preserved underwater, archaeobotany and archaeozoology have roles in underwater archaeology. For example, for submerged terrestrial sites or inland water, identification of pollen samples from sedimentary or silt layers can provide information on the plants growing on surrounding land and hence on the nature of the landscape. Information about metal artifacts can be obtained through X-ray of concretions. Geology can provide insight into how the site evolved, including changes in sea-level, erosion by rivers and deposition by rivers or in the sea.

=== Artifact recovery and conservation ===
Artifacts recovered from underwater sites need stabilization to manage the process of removal of water and conservation. The artifact either needs to be dried carefully, or the water replaced with some inert medium (as in the case of The Mary Rose). Artifacts recovered from salt water, particularly metals and glass need be stabilized following absorption of salt or leaching of metals. In-situ conservation of underwater structures is possible, but consideration needs to be given to the dynamic nature of the site. Changes to the site during intrusive investigation or removal of artifacts may result in scouring which exposes the site to further deterioration.

=== Interpretation and presentation of underwater archaeology ===
Diver trails also called wreck trails can be used to allow scuba-divers to visit and understand archaeological sites that are suitable for scuba-diving One excellent example is the Florida Public Archaeology Network&#x27;s (FPAN) &quot;Florida Panhandle Shipwreck Trail.&quot; The Florida Panhandle Shipwreck Trail features 12 shipwrecks including artificial reefs and a variety of sea life for diving, snorkeling and fishing offshore of Pensacola, Destin, Panama City and Port St. Joe, Florida. Otherwise presentation will typically rely on publication (book or journal articles, web-sites and electronic media such as CD-ROM). Television programs, web videos and social media can also bring an understanding of underwater archaeology to a broad audience. The &quot;Mardi Gras&quot; Shipwreck Project integrated a one-hour HD documentary, short videos for public viewing and video updates during the expedition as part of the educational outreach. Webcasting is also another tool for educational outreach. For one week in 2000 and 2001, live underwater video of the &quot;Queen Anne&#x27;s Revenge&quot; Shipwreck Project was webcast to the Internet as a part of the &quot;QAR DiveLive&quot; educational program that reached thousands of children around the world. Created and co-produced by Nautilus Productions and Marine Grafics, this project enabled students to talk to scientists and learn about methods and technologies utilized by the underwater archaeology team.

==Environmental impact==
Underwater archeology can have many impacts on the environment such as destroying habitats and disrupting wildlife that may be in the area of the archeological site. 

== History ==
== Publications ==
Publication is an essential part of the archaeological process and is particularly crucial for underwater archaeology, where sites are generally not accessible and it is often the case that sites are not preserved in-situ.

The specialist journals on maritime archaeology, which include the long established &quot;International Journal of Nautical Archaeology&quot;, &quot;The Bulletin of the Australasian Institute for Maritime Archaeology&quot; (AIMA) and the recently launched &quot;Journal of Maritime Archaeology&quot; publish articles about maritime archaeological research and underwater archaeology. However, research on underwater sites can also be published in mainstream archaeological journals, or thematic archaeological journals. Some institutions also make their unpublished reports, often called &#x27;Grey Literature&#x27;, accessible thereby allowing access to far more detail and a wider range of archaeological data than is otherwise the case with books and journals. An example is the works of the Department of Maritime Archaeology at the Western Australian Museum.

The public interest market is covered by a number of diving, shipwreck and underwater archaeology books, beginning with the works of Jacques Cousteau.

The techniques of underwater archaeology are also documented in published works, including a number of handbooks, and Muckelroy&#x27;s classic work on Maritime Archaeology.

<text>Since 1840, when the Penny Black featured a profile of Queen Victoria, it has been a tradition worldwide for nations to honor people on their postage stamps. Typical choices include monarchs, important figures of history, politicians, cultural leaders, and (more recently) celebrities.

The usual practice is for the stamp to feature a portrait of the person, either full-length or head alone. In a few cases, the person being honored is represented by an image relating to the person&#x27;s life. However, the depiction of a work of art (such as for a Christmas stamp) is not considered to be honoring the artist.

The list that follows is an index to the lists of people for individual countries. In some cases, several short lists from related countries are merged into a single list, while entries without links indicate entities that never had any people on their stamps. The parenthesized dates following each entry indicates the first and last dates of stamp issuance; within each country&#x27;s list, the date or dates indicates the year of the person&#x27;s appearance on a stamp.

<text>Margaret Mary Emily Anne Hyra (born November 19, 1961), known by her stage name Meg Ryan, is an American actress. Known for her leading roles as quirky, charismatic women since the late 1980s, Ryan is particularly recognized for her work in romantic comedies, a genre she dominated during the 1980s and 1990s. Dubbed &quot;America&#x27;s Sweetheart&quot; by the media, she became one of Hollywood&#x27;s most bankable stars of the latter decade.

She made her acting debut in 1981 in the drama film &quot;Rich and Famous&quot;. She joined the cast of the CBS soap opera &quot;As the World Turns&quot; in 1982. In the 1980s, Ryan appeared in &quot;Top Gun&quot; (1986), &quot;Promised Land&quot; (1987), and the Rob Reiner-directed romantic comedy &quot;When Harry Met Sally...&quot; (1989), for which she earned a Golden Globe nomination.

A prolific actress through the 1990s and 2000s, Ryan appeared in &quot;Joe Versus the Volcano&quot; (1990), &quot;The Doors&quot; (1991), &quot;Sleepless in Seattle&quot; (1993), &quot;When a Man Loves a Woman&quot; (1994), &quot;French Kiss&quot; (1995), &quot;Courage Under Fire&quot; (1996)&quot;, Anastasia&quot; (1997), &quot;Addicted to Love&quot; (1997), &quot;You&#x27;ve Got Mail&quot; (1998), &quot;City of Angels&quot; (1998), &quot;Proof of Life&quot; (2000), &quot;Kate &amp; Leopold&quot; (2001), and &quot;The Women&quot; (2008). In 2015, she made her directorial debut with &quot;Ithaca,&quot; in which she also starred. After an eight year hiatus, Ryan returned to the screen in the romantic comedy &quot;What Happens Later&quot; (2023), which she also directed.

== Early life ==
Ryan was born and raised in Fairfield, Connecticut, to Susan Jordan (&quot;née&quot; Duggan), a former actress and English teacher, and Harry Hyra, a math teacher. Her father is of Polish descent. She was raised Catholic and attended St. Pius X Elementary School in Fairfield. She has two sisters, Dana () and Annie (), and a brother, musician Andrew Hyra, a member of the band Billy Pilgrim. Her parents divorced in 1976 when she was 15.

Ryan graduated from Bethel High School in 1979. She studied journalism as an undergraduate, first at the University of Connecticut and then at New York University. During college, she acted in television commercials and the soap opera &quot;As the World Turns&quot; to earn extra money. Her success as an actress led her to leave college a semester before she planned to graduate. When she joined the Screen Actors Guild, she used the surname &quot;Ryan&quot;, her maternal grandmother&#x27;s maiden name.

== Career ==

=== Early work ===

After her film debut in director George Cukor&#x27;s final film, &quot;Rich and Famous&quot;, in 1981, Ryan played Betsy Stewart in the daytime drama &quot;As the World Turns&quot; from 1982 to 1984; her character was featured in a popular romantic story arc.
She also appeared in some television commercials during the early 1980s for Burger King and Aim toothpaste, among others. Several television and smaller film roles followed, including appearances in &quot;Charles in Charge&quot;, &quot;Armed and Dangerous&quot;, and &quot;Amityville 3-D&quot;. Her role in &quot;Promised Land&quot; (1987) earned Ryan her first Independent Spirit Award nomination.

In 1986, she played Carole Bradshaw, the wife of Anthony Edwards&#x27; character, naval flight officer Nick &quot;Goose&quot; Bradshaw, in &quot;Top Gun&quot;. Scenes with them were reprised in the 2022 sequel &quot;Top Gun: Maverick&quot; as flashbacks to illustrate the emotional conflicts between lead character Pete &quot;Maverick&quot; Mitchell (Tom Cruise) and the Bradshaws&#x27; grown son, Bradley &quot;Rooster&quot; Bradshaw (Miles Teller).

Ryan appeared in the film &quot;Innerspace&quot; in 1987 with her future husband Dennis Quaid, and they subsequently costarred in the remake of &quot;D.O.A.&quot; (1988) and &quot;Flesh and Bone&quot; (1993). She also costarred in 1988 with Sean Connery and Mark Harmon in &quot;The Presidio&quot;.

=== 1989–1999: Career breakthrough and stardom ===
Ryan&#x27;s first leading role was the romantic comedy &quot;When Harry Met Sally...&quot; (1989), which paired her with comic actor Billy Crystal and earned her a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical. Her portrayal of Sally Albright includes an oft-recounted scene in which her character, lunching with Crystal&#x27;s character in Katz&#x27;s Delicatessen in Manhattan, theatrically demonstrates for him how easy it is for a woman to fake an orgasm.

Ryan next appeared in Oliver Stone&#x27;s moderately successful film &quot;The Doors&quot;, and in &quot;Prelude to a Kiss&quot;, which flopped. In 1993, the hugely successful romantic comedy &quot;Sleepless in Seattle&quot; paired Ryan for a second time with Tom Hanks. They had previously been the romantic leads, with Ryan playing three different women, in John Patrick Shanley&#x27;s &quot;Joe Versus the Volcano&quot; in 1990 — a commercial disappointment which later developed a cult following. (Hanks and Ryan were once again paired in another box-office success, &quot;You&#x27;ve Got Mail&quot;, in 1998.) She earned her second nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical for her performance in &quot;Sleepless in Seattle&quot;. She was offered the role of FBI agent Clarice Starling, the protagonist of &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; (1991), but rejected it due to the film&#x27;s gruesome and violent themes.

In 1994, Ryan played an alcoholic high-school guidance counselor – far from the romantic-comedy ingenue roles for which she had become famous – in Luis Mandoki&#x27;s social romantic drama &quot;When a Man Loves a Woman&quot;, also starring Andy Garcia. The film and her performance were both well received by critics. A critic for &quot;Variety&quot; called the film &quot;a first-class production, accentuated by fine performances and an unflinching script,&quot; and another praised Ryan for her &quot;roller-coaster role&quot;. The film was a notable success, grossing $50 million in the United States alone, and garnered Ryan a nomination for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role. The same year, Ryan returned to type, starring alongside Tim Robbins in Fred Schepisi&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;I.Q.&quot; The film centers on a mechanic and a Princeton doctoral candidate who fall in love, with the aid of the graduate student&#x27;s uncle, Albert Einstein (played by Walter Matthau). Ryan later won Harvard&#x27;s Hasty Pudding Woman of the Year award, and &quot;People Magazine&quot; dubbed her one of &quot;the 50 most beautiful people in the world&quot;.

In 1995, critic Richard Corliss called Ryan &quot;the current soul of romantic comedy&quot;. The same year she also starred opposite Kevin Kline in Lawrence Kasdan&#x27;s &quot;French Kiss&quot;, a comedy catering to her &quot;America&#x27;s Sweetheart&quot; image, and was awarded the Women in Film Crystal Award – given to &quot;outstanding women who, through their endurance and the excellence of their work, have helped to expand the role of women within the entertainment industry.&quot;

In 1996, Ryan starred as a helicopter pilot in the war drama &quot;Courage Under Fire&quot;, a critical and commercial success. The following year, she voiced the lead role in the animated film &quot;Anastasia&quot;, which met with good reviews and box office success, and she and Matthew Broderick played a pair of jilted lovers bent on revenge in the black comedy &quot;Addicted to Love&quot;, giving Ryan a female lead at least superficially different from her usual roles.
In 1998, she starred in two films. &quot;City of Angels&quot; (an American remake of Wim Wenders&#x27; &quot;Wings of Desire&quot;) drew positive reviews and earned nearly $200 million worldwide. &quot;You&#x27;ve Got Mail&quot;, reteaming Ryan with Hanks, earned her a third nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical and made more than $250 million worldwide. She also appeared in 1998&#x27;s &quot;Hurlyburly&quot; with Sean Penn.

=== 2000–2006: Continued roles ===
Ryan&#x27;s first film of the 2000s was &quot;Hanging Up&quot;, a Diane Keaton-directed family comedy-drama about a trio of sisters who bond over the approaching death of their curmudgeonly father. Also starring Keaton, Lisa Kudrow and Walter Matthau, the film adaptation of Delia Ephron&#x27;s 1995 novel received poor reviews from critics.

The same year, Ryan was cast in the action thriller &quot;Proof of Life&quot; with Russell Crowe, directed by Taylor Hackford. In the film, she portrayed the distraught wife of a kidnapped engineer, played by David Morse, while relying on a resourceful troubleshooter who makes a profession of dealing with international bandits. While the film became a lukewarm critical and commercial success, grossing $63 million worldwide, it garnered much reportage in the tabloid press in association with Ryan and Crowe&#x27;s affair. Stephen Holden, film critic for &quot;The New York Times,&quot; did not think the film worked well and opined that the actors did not connect.
A year later, she once again returned to her romantic comedy roots with &quot;Kate &amp; Leopold&quot; (2001), alongside Hugh Jackman. A film about a British Duke who travels through time from New York in 1876 to the present and falls in love with a successful market researcher in the modern New York, the James Mangold-directed film received a mixed-to-positive response, with Lael Loewenstein of &quot;Variety&quot; summing it as &quot;a mostly charming and diverting tale&quot;. At a total gross of $70 million, it would be Ryan&#x27;s highest-grossing film of the decade.

In 2003, Ryan broke away from her usual roles, starring alongside Mark Ruffalo and Jennifer Jason Leigh in Jane Campion&#x27;s erotic thriller film &quot;In the Cut&quot;. Co-producer Nicole Kidman had originally been cast in the lead, but the actress eventually dropped out after five years of development, leaving the role to Ryan, who appeared nude in a lengthy and rather graphic love scene for the first time in her career. Although her image-conflicting depiction earned Ryan and the film much media attention, the film failed with critics and grossed only $23 million in theaters. While promoting &quot;In the Cut&quot; on Michael Parkinson&#x27;s talk show &quot;Parkinson&quot;, the actress was offended by the host&#x27;s questions regarding filming nude scenes, appearing disinterested, delivering one-word responses, and suggesting that Parkinson end their interview when asked what she would do in his position. The interaction is considered to be one of the most infamous in talk show history. Three years after the interview aired, Ryan explained that she felt Parkinson was berating her for performing nudity and had attempted to disagree with his views respectfully. Parkinson eventually apologized for losing his temper in 2021, but maintained that Ryan&#x27;s behavior &quot;played a part in it too&quot;. 

She continued the strategy of acting against type with a leading role in Charles S. Dutton&#x27;s directorial debut &quot;Against the Ropes&quot; (2004), a fictionalized sport drama about American boxing manager Jackie Kallen, the first woman to become a success in the sport. The film grossed less than $6 million in the U.S. and was panned by critics, in part because of its resemblance to other boxing films, such as the &quot;Rocky&quot; series.

=== 2007–2009: Independent films ===
Following a three-year hiatus, Ryan returned to film with Jon Kasdan&#x27;s 2007 independent film &quot;In the Land of Women&quot;. Starring alongside Kristen Stewart and Olympia Dukakis, she played Sarah Hardwicke, a mother and wife facing breast cancer, who connects with her neighbor&#x27;s much younger grandson, played by Adam Brody. Released to mixed reviews by critics, the film grossed $17.5 million worldwide, exceeding its budget of $10 million. Ryan received a positive response for her performance, with Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; noting it &quot;the best work [she] has done in forever&quot;.

Ryan&#x27;s first film release of 2008 was &quot;The Deal&quot;, a satirical comedy film based on Peter Lefcourt&#x27;s 1991 novel of the same title about Hollywood. Directed by Steven Schachter and co-starring William H. Macy, the film was shot in Cape Town and other South African locations and celebrated its world premiere at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival. Garnering generally mixed to negative reviews, it failed to draw interest among film studios, resulting in a straight-to-DVD release in January 2009. In his review for &quot;Variety&quot;, Peter Debruge said, &quot;The characters seem to be doing all the laughing, while the general public has nothing to cling to but the horndog flirtation between mismatched leads William H. Macy and Meg Ryan—hardly ideal ingredients for mainstream success.&quot; Ryan also starred in George Gallo&#x27;s &quot;My Mom&#x27;s New Boyfriend&quot;, shot in 2006 but released direct-to-DVD in 2008. Co-starring Colin Hanks, Selma Blair and Antonio Banderas, the action comedy received overwhelmingly negative reviews, with David Nusair of &quot;Reel Film&quot; noting it &quot;an unmitigated disaster virtually from its opening frames&quot;.
Ryan&#x27;s last film of 2008 was &quot;The Women&quot;, a remake of the 1939 production. The all-female cast comprises Annette Bening, Debra Messing, and Jada Pinkett Smith. Written, produced and directed by Diane English, the film centers on a group of four female Manhattan socialites whose primary interest is idle gossip, with Ryan portraying a wealthy woman whose husband is cheating on her with a shop girl, played by Eva Mendes. Ryan was the first actress to join the long-delayed production, which had struggled to find financing since the early 1990s, resulting in an independent production budgeted at $18 million. Upon its release, &quot;The Women&quot; received a disastrous response from critics, with Richard Schickel of &quot;Time&quot; calling it &quot;one of the worst movies I&#x27;ve ever seen&quot;. The film was a financial success, however, becoming Ryan&#x27;s most successful film since 2001&#x27;s &quot;Kate &amp; Leopold&quot; with a worldwide gross of $50 million.

In 2009, Ryan starred alongside Kristen Bell and Justin Long in the independent comedy film &quot;Serious Moonlight&quot;. In this film, directed by actress Cheryl Hines and based on a screenplay by late writer Adrienne Shelly, who was murdered a year prior to filming, Ryan portrayed a high-powered female attorney who learns that her husband, played by Timothy Hutton, is about to leave their troubled marriage, and decides to hold him captive by duct-taping him to a toilet. Picked up by Magnolia Pictures, the production received a limited release throughout North America only and grossed less than $150,000 worldwide. Critical reaction to the film was generally mixed-to-negative, although Ryan was praised for her &quot;terrific&quot; performance. Also in 2009, Ryan guest-starred on the seventh season of &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;.

=== 2010–present: Directing ===
Ryan was attached to several productions in the early 2010s—including the ensemble drama &quot;Lives of The Saints&quot; opposite Kat Dennings, Kevin Zegers, and John Lithgow, and &quot;Long Time Gone&quot;, a film adaptation of the April Stevens novel &quot;Angel Angel&quot;,—all of which failed to materialize. In April 2011, it was announced that Ryan would make her feature film directing debut in &quot;Into the Beautiful&quot;, described as &quot;a contemporary &quot;Big Chill&quot; with longtime friends reconnecting&quot;, but it was never made.

In October 2012, Ryan was featured in the PBS documentary &quot;Half the Sky: Turning Oppression into Opportunity for Women Worldwide&quot;. The series introduces women and girls living under difficult circumstances and fighting to challenge them. The same month, Ryan&#x27;s audiobook recording of William Saroyan&#x27;s &quot;The Human Comedy&quot; was released. In October 2013, it was reported that Ryan would be returning to television to produce and star in a new comedy for NBC revolving around a former hotshot New York editor, for which it again failed to get production approval.

Following another four-year hiatus, Ryan re-teamed with Lisa Kudrow on her improvisational comedy series &quot;Web Therapy&quot;, for which she filmed five episodes in 2013. The following year, she provided the future voice of Greta Gerwig&#x27;s character in the pilot of &quot;How I Met Your Dad&quot;, a woman-centric variation of the CBS sitcom &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot; that was not picked up. CBS later passed on the project.

Ryan&#x27;s next feature film was the ABC Family film &quot;Fan Girl&quot;, an independent comedy about a 15-year-old girl, played by Kiernan Shipka, with a passion for filmmaking who sets out to make a movie about her favorite band, All Time Low. It premiered at the Los Angeles Film Festival in June 2015.

Also in 2015, Ryan made her directing debut with &quot;Ithaca&quot;, a drama film based on the 1943 novel &quot;The Human Comedy&quot; by William Saroyan. Filmed in Petersburg, Virginia, it starred Ryan and had its world premiere at the Middleburg Film Festival in October. Ryan returned to the screen alongside David Duchovny in the 2023 romantic comedy, &quot;What Happens Later&quot;, also directed by Ryan.

== Public image and legacy ==
During the peak of her career, Ryan was one of Hollywood&#x27;s most bankable stars, comparable to Julia Roberts. She has been called one of the greatest actresses of the 1990s. She was also one of Hollywood&#x27;s highest-paid, earning as much as $15 million per film by the end of the decade. Ryan is particularly known for her work in romantic comedies, having starred in several from the late 1980s until the early 2000s. The 1990s were particularly prolific for Ryan&#x27;s work in the genre, appearing in six romantic comedies during the decade. Two of her films, &quot;When Harry Met Sally...&quot;(1989) and &quot;Sleepless in Seattle&quot; (1993), are ranked among the 10 greatest romantic comedies of all time by the American Film Institute. The organization also ranked the same films among the 100 greatest romance films, at numbers 25 and 45 respectively. Journalist Jane Pauley, as well as Kate Erbland of IndieWire, recognized Ryan as one of the leading ladies responsible for the genre&#x27;s resurgence, earning her the nickname the &quot;Queen of Rom-coms&quot;. Benjamin Lee of &quot;The Guardian&quot; attributes Ryan&#x27;s association with the genre to her &quot;endless source of warmth and charisma, boasting a magic, ineffable charm that only a handful of other actors have ever truly had&quot;. Journalist Michael Shnayerson declared Ryan the &quot;queen of the screwball romantic comedy&quot; whose &quot;instinct for physical comedy puts her in a league with the greats—Carole Lombard, Rosalind Russell, Jean Arthur&quot;.

For much of her career, Ryan typically played cheerful, witty, and quirky women in romantic comedies, but she has also starred in thrillers, dramas, and action films. Ryan does not feel she was pigeonholed into the romantic comedy genre, explaining that they comprise a comparatively small portion of her filmography, and insists that her desire to explore different genres as an actor did not stem from any pressure to reinvent herself, but rather a genuine passion for trying new roles. Described as an embodiment of the girl next door archetype, the media dubbed Ryan &quot;America&#x27;s sweetheart&quot; due to both her wholesome on and offscreen personas, a label she admitted to feeling conflicted about. Joanna Robinson of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; felt Ryan&#x27;s early roles limited both the jobs she was offered and audience perception of her. However, journalist Andrew Anthony insists Ryan was greatly responsible for the image she perpetuated, rather than a victim of it.

Some of the actress&#x27; attempts to explore different archetypes and genres have been met with mixed results. Notably, her role in &quot;In the Cut&quot; (2003) drew backlash from critics and fans, after which she dramatically limited her workload and public appearances. &quot;The New Republic&quot;&#x27;s David Thomson said Ryan became &quot;widely regarded as that nice girl next door ... who lost her sweetness&quot; after the film. In retrospect, Ryan said they should have prepared audiences for her departure from the archetype she had become known for. According to Anthony Brett of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, Ryan&#x27;s infamous &quot;Parkinson&quot; interview damaged her reputation for several years. Ryan&#x27;s public image also suffered from rumors that she had cheated on then-husband Dennis Quaid with &quot;Proof of Life&quot; (2000) co-star Russell Crowe. In 2019, Ryan described herself as a &quot;terrible celebrity&quot; who finds fame to be uncomfortable, exhausting and disabling.

Ryan is particularly fond of movies from the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s, citing actors Claudette Colbert, Clark Gable, Carole Lombard, Katharine Hepburn and Jimmy Stewart as personal favorites and influences of hers. She claims to have never read an article written about her or her work, describing herself as too vulnerable. Ryan also became known for the shag haircut she wore during the 1990s, which was often requested by fans and nicknamed &quot;The Meg&quot; after her.

== Personal life ==
Ryan married actor Dennis Quaid on February 14, 1991. They have one child together, Jack Quaid, born April 24, 1992. She and Quaid announced their separation in June 2000, and their divorce became final in July 2001. There were allegations of infidelity on both sides, and Quaid added that Ryan&#x27;s fame was a factor in the divorce, 

Ryan became romantically involved with actor Russell Crowe while working on their 2000 film &quot;Proof of Life&quot;.

In January 2006, Ryan adopted a 14-month-old girl from China whom she named Daisy True. From 2010 to 2014, Ryan was in a relationship with American singer-songwriter John Mellencamp. They reunited in 2017, and Ryan announced their engagement on November 8, 2018. In October 2019, it was reported that Ryan had ended their engagement.

==Political views==
Ryan has publicly supported the Democratic Party, especially its environmental protection programs and initiatives. In 2003, she supported Wesley Clark&#x27;s campaign for U.S. president. She later supported John Kerry in the 2004 presidential election campaign.

== Filmography ==
== Awards and nominations ==
Ryan has received multiple awards and nominations throughout her career, including three Golden Globe Award nominations for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical for her performance in the romantic comedies &quot;When Harry Met Sally...&quot; (1989), &quot;Sleepless in Seattle&quot; (1993) and &quot;You&#x27;ve Got Mail&quot; (1998).

<text>Terence Graham Parry Jones (1 February 1942 – 21 January 2020) was a Welsh actor, comedian, director, historian, writer and member of the Monty Python comedy troupe.

After graduating from Oxford University with a degree in English, Jones and writing partner Michael Palin wrote and performed for several high-profile British comedy programmes, including &quot;Do Not Adjust Your Set&quot; and &quot;The Frost Report&quot;, before creating &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; with Cambridge graduates Graham Chapman, John Cleese, and Eric Idle and American animator-filmmaker Terry Gilliam. Jones was largely responsible for the programme&#x27;s innovative, surreal structure, in which sketches flowed from one to the next without the use of punch lines. He made his directorial debut with &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot;, which he co-directed with Gilliam, and also directed the subsequent Python films &quot;Life of Brian&quot; and &quot;The Meaning of Life&quot;.

Jones co-created and co-wrote with Palin the anthology series &quot;Ripping Yarns&quot;. He also wrote an early draft of Jim Henson&#x27;s film &quot;Labyrinth&quot; and is credited with the screenplay, though little of his work actually remained in the final cut. Jones was a well-respected medieval historian, having written or co-written several books and presented television documentaries about the period, as well as a prolific children&#x27;s author. In 2016, Jones received a Lifetime Achievement award at the BAFTA Cymru Awards for his outstanding contribution to television and film. After living for several years with a degenerative aphasia, he gradually lost the ability to speak and died in 2020 from frontotemporal dementia.

== Early life ==
Jones was born on 1 February 1942 in the seaside town of Colwyn Bay, on the north coast of Wales, the son of housewife Dilys Louisa (Newnes), and Alick George Parry-Jones, a bank clerk. When he was born during World War II, his father was serving with the Royal Air Force in Scotland. A week after he was born, his father was posted in India as a Flight Lieutenant (Temporary). His brother Nigel was two years his senior. He reunited with his father when the war ended four years later; of their first meeting at Colwyn Bay railway station he recalled: &quot;I&#x27;d only ever been kissed by the smooth lips of a lady up until that point, so his bristly moustache was quite disturbing!&quot; When Jones was four and a half, the family moved to Claygate, Surrey, England.

Jones attended Esher COE primary school and the Royal Grammar School in Guildford, where he was school captain in the 1960–61 academic year. He read English at St Edmund Hall, Oxford, but &quot;strayed into history&quot;. He became interested in the medieval period through reading Chaucer as part of his English degree. He graduated with a 2:1. While there, he performed comedy with future Monty Python castmate Michael Palin in the Oxford Revue. Jones was a year ahead of Palin at Oxford, and on first meeting him Palin states, &quot;The first thing that struck me was what a nice bloke he was. He had no airs and graces. We had a similar idea of what humour could do and where it should go, mainly because we both liked characters; we both appreciated that comedy wasn&#x27;t just jokes.&quot;

== Career history ==

=== Before Python and early Python ===
Jones appeared in &quot;Twice a Fortnight&quot; with Michael Palin, Graeme Garden, Bill Oddie and Jonathan Lynn, as well as the television series &quot;The Complete and Utter History of Britain&quot; (1969). He appeared in &quot;Do Not Adjust Your Set&quot; (1967–69) with Palin, Eric Idle and David Jason. He wrote for &quot;The Frost Report&quot; and several other David Frost programmes on British television. Of Jones&#x27; contributions as a performer to &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;, his depictions of middle-aged women (or &quot;ratbag old women&quot; as termed by the BBC, also known as &quot;pepper-pots&quot; or &quot;grannies from hell&quot;) are among the most memorable.

=== Directorial work ===
Jones co-directed &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot; with Terry Gilliam, and was sole director on two further Monty Python movies, &quot;Life of Brian&quot; and &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s The Meaning of Life&quot;. As a film director, Jones finally gained fuller control of the projects and devised a distinct, signature style that relied on visual comedy and surreal touches to complement the jokes. He would repeatedly abandon punchlines and create fragmented, non-sequitur story arcs to bring out the deadpan humour. His later films include &quot;Erik the Viking&quot; (1989) and &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot; (1996). In 2008, Jones wrote the libretto for and directed the opera &quot;Evil Machines&quot;. In 2011, he was commissioned to direct and write the libretto for another opera, entitled &quot;The Doctor&#x27;s Tale&quot;.

Three of the films which Jones directed—&quot;The Meaning of Life&quot;, &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Life of Brian&quot; and &quot;Personal Services&quot;—were banned in Ireland.

Jones directed the 2015 comedy film &quot;Absolutely Anything&quot;, about a disillusioned schoolteacher who is given the chance to do anything he wishes by a group of aliens watching from space. The film features Simon Pegg, Kate Beckinsale, Robin Williams and the voices of the five remaining members of Monty Python. It was filmed in London during a six-week shoot.

In 2016, Jones directed &quot;Jeepers Creepers&quot;, a West End play about the life of comic Marty Feldman. It was his last directing work before his death.

=== Writer and brewer ===
Jones wrote many books and screenplays, including comic works and more serious writing on medieval history.

A member of the Campaign for Real Ale, Jones also had interest in real ale and in 1977 co-founded the Penrhos Brewery, a microbrewery at Penrhos Court at Penrhos, Herefordshire, which ran until 1983. The former brewery has now become a pub called The Python&#x27;s Arms.

==== Comedy ====
Jones co-wrote &quot;Ripping Yarns&quot; with Palin. They also wrote a play, &quot;Underwood&#x27;s Finest Hour&quot;, which was staged at the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith in 1981, about an obstetrician distracted during a birth by the radio broadcast of a Test match. Jones also wrote numerous works for children, including &quot;Fantastic Stories&quot;, &quot;The Beast with a Thousand Teeth&quot; and a collection of comic verse called &quot;The Curse of the Vampire&#x27;s Socks&quot;.

Jones was the co-creator (with Gavin Scott) of the animated TV series &quot;Blazing Dragons&quot; (1996–1998), which parodied the Arthurian legends and Middle Ages periods. Reversing a common story convention, the series&#x27; protagonists are anthropomorphic dragons beset by evil humans.

==== Screenplays ====
Jones wrote the screenplay for &quot;Labyrinth&quot; (1986), although his draft went through several rewrites and several other writers before being filmed; consequently, much of the finished film was not actually written by Jones.

==== History ====

Jones wrote books and presented television documentaries on medieval and ancient history. His first book was &quot;Chaucer&#x27;s Knight: The Portrait of a Medieval Mercenary&quot; (1980), which offers an alternative take on Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;The Knight&#x27;s Tale&quot;. Chaucer&#x27;s knight is often interpreted as a paragon of Christian virtue, but Jones asserts that if one studies historical accounts of the battles the knight claims he was involved in, he can be interpreted as a typical mercenary and a potentially cold-blooded killer. He also co-wrote &quot;Who Murdered Chaucer?&quot; (2003) in which he argues that Chaucer was close to King Richard II, and that after Richard was deposed, Chaucer was persecuted to death by Thomas Arundel.

Jones&#x27; TV series also frequently challenged popular views of history. For example, in &quot;Terry Jones&#x27; Medieval Lives&quot; (2004; for which he received a 2004 Emmy nomination for &quot;Outstanding Writing for Nonfiction Programming&quot;) he argues that the Middle Ages was a more sophisticated period than is popularly thought, and &quot;Terry Jones&#x27; Barbarians&quot; (2006) presents the cultural achievements of peoples conquered by the Roman Empire in a more positive light than Roman historians typically have, attributing the Sack of Rome in AD 410 to propaganda.

==== Column writing ====
Jones wrote numerous columns for &quot;The Guardian, The Daily Telegraph&quot; and &quot;The Observer&quot; condemning the Iraq War. Many of these editorials were published in a paperback collection titled &quot;Terry Jones&#x27;s War on the War on Terror&quot;.

In November 2011, his book &quot;Evil Machines&quot; was launched by the online publishing house Unbound at the Adam Street Club in London. It was the first book to be published by a crowdfunding website dedicated solely to books. Jones provided significant support to Unbound as they developed their publishing concept. In February 2018, Jones released &quot;The Tyrant and the Squire&quot;, also with Unbound.

==== Poetry ====
Jones was a member of the Poetry Society, and his poems have appeared in &quot;Poetry Review&quot;.

=== Work with musicians ===
Jones performed with the Carnival Band and appears on their 2007 CD &quot;Ringing the Changes&quot;.

In January 2008, the Teatro São Luiz, in Lisbon, Portugal, premiered &quot;Evil Machines&quot; – a musical play, written by Jones (based on his book), with original music by Portuguese composer Luis Tinoco. Jones was invited by the Teatro São Luiz to write and direct the play, after a successful run of &quot;Contos Fantásticos&quot;, a short play based on Jones&#x27; &quot;Fantastic Stories&quot;, also with music by Tinoco.

In January 2012 Jones announced that he was working with songwriter/producer Jim Steinman on a heavy metal version of &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;.

=== As performer ===
Apart from a cameo in Terry Gilliam&#x27;s &quot;Jabberwocky&quot; and a minor role as a drunken vicar in the BBC sitcom &quot;The Young Ones&quot;, Jones rarely appeared in work outside his own projects. From 2009 to 2011, however, he provided narration for &quot;The Legend of Dick and Dom&quot;, a CBBC fantasy series set in the Middle Ages. He also appears in two French films by Albert Dupontel: &quot;Le Créateur&quot; (1999) and &quot;Enfermés dehors&quot; (2006).

In 2009, Jones took part in the BBC Wales programme &quot;Coming Home&quot; about his Welsh family history. In July 2014, Jones reunited with the other four living Pythons to perform at ten dates (&quot;Monty Python Live (Mostly)&quot;) at the O2 Arena in London. This was Jones&#x27; last performance with the group prior to his aphasia diagnosis.

In October 2016, Jones received a standing ovation at the BAFTA Cymru Awards when he received a Lifetime Achievement award for his outstanding contribution to television and film.

== Personal life ==

=== Marriages ===
Jones married Alison Telfer in 1970; they had two children together, Sally in 1974 and Bill in 1976. They lived in Camberwell, London and had an open marriage. In 2009, Jones left Telfer for Anna Söderström; she was 41 years his junior and they had been in a relationship for five years. In September 2009, Söderström and Jones had a daughter, and in 2012 they married. The family settled in Highgate, North London.

=== Political views ===
In a 1984 interview, Jones stated &quot;if I had any political convictions, I would say that I am an anarchist&quot;, stating that anarchism was a belief in government from the bottom up, rather than something imposed from above.

Jones published a number of articles on political and social commentary, principally in newspapers &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;The Independent&quot; and &quot;The Observer&quot;. Many of these articles mocked the war on terror, belittling it as &quot;declaring war on an abstract noun&quot; and comparing it to attempting to &quot;annihilate mockery&quot;.

In August 2014, Jones was one of 200 public figures who signed a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in September&#x27;s referendum on that issue.

=== Health and death ===
In October 2006, Jones was diagnosed with colon cancer and underwent surgery. After a course of chemotherapy, he was declared free of the disease. Later reminiscing about the event, he said, &quot;Unfortunately, my illness is not nearly bad enough to sell many newspapers and the prognosis is even more disappointing.&quot;

In 2015, Jones was diagnosed with primary progressive aphasia, a form of frontotemporal dementia that impairs the ability to speak and communicate. He had first given cause for concern during the Monty Python reunion show &quot;Monty Python Live (Mostly)&quot; in July 2014 because of difficulties learning his lines. He became a campaigner for awareness of, and fundraiser for research into, dementia; he donated his brain for dementia research. By September 2016, he was no longer able to give interviews. By April 2017, he had lost the ability to say more than a few words of agreement.

On 21 January 2020, Jones died at his home in Highgate from complications of dementia. His family and close friends remembered him with a humanist funeral ceremony.

<doc id="51801" wikidata="Q964329" url="?curid=51801" title="David Jason">
<text>Sir David John White (born 2 February 1940), known professionally as David Jason, is an English actor. He has played Derek &quot;Del Boy&quot; Trotter in the BBC sitcom &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot;, Detective Inspector Jack Frost in &quot;A Touch of Frost,&quot; Granville in &quot;Open All Hours&quot; and &quot;Still Open All Hours,&quot; and Pop Larkin in &quot;The Darling Buds of May&quot;, as well as voicing several cartoon characters, including Mr. Toad in &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot;, the BFG in the 1989 film, and the title characters of &quot;Danger Mouse&quot; and &quot;Count Duckula&quot;.

In September 2006, Jason had topped the poll to find TV&#x27;s 50 Greatest Stars, as part of ITV&#x27;s 50th anniversary celebrations. He was knighted in 2005 for services to acting and comedy. Jason has won four British Academy Television Awards (BAFTAs), (1988, 1991, 1997, 2003), four British Comedy Awards (1990, 1992, 1997, 2001) and seven National Television Awards (1996 twice, 1997, 2001 twice, 2002 and 2011).

==Early life==
Jason&#x27;s father, Arthur Robert White, was a porter at Billingsgate Fish Market, and his mother, Olwen Jones, was from Merthyr Tydfil, Glamorgan, Wales, and worked as a charwoman. She gave birth to twin boys at North Middlesex Hospital in Edmonton, London, in February 1940, but Jason&#x27;s twin brother died during childbirth, making him a twinless twin. He chose the stage name Jason because he liked &quot;Jason and the Argonauts&quot;, as the stage name &quot;David White&quot; was already taken, and not in tribute to his dead twin as has sometimes been claimed.

Jason lived at Lodge Lane, North Finchley, and attended Northfield Secondary Modern school after failing the 11-plus in 1951. Upon leaving school, Jason wanted to be an actor, influenced by his brother, but their father advised that he first learn a trade. He trained as an electrician for six years, before retiring and becoming a struggling actor.

Jason&#x27;s elder brother is the actor Arthur White, born in 1933. The two appeared together in the crime drama &quot;A Touch of Frost&quot;, with Arthur playing police archivist Ernie Trigg; and again in 2008, in the comic fantasy &quot;The Colour of Magic&quot;, where Arthur played a character called &quot;Rerpf&quot;. He also appeared briefly with his brother in two episodes of &quot;The Darling Buds of May&quot;.

When Jason was 15, he spent a year working as a mechanic&#x27;s assistant. When he turned 16, he was eligible to register for an apprenticeship, but decided against it.

==Radio and TV career==
===Early years===
Jason started his television career in 1966 playing the part of Bert Bradshaw in &quot;Crossroads&quot;. In 1967, he played spoof super-hero Captain Fantastic, among other roles, in the children&#x27;s comedy series &quot;Do Not Adjust Your Set&quot; (Rediffusion London/ITV) with Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Denise Coffey, and Michael Palin. Humphrey Barclay, who recruited Jason to appear in &quot;Do Not Adjust Your Set&quot; (partly to counter the more highbrow style of Idle, Jones, and Palin), admired his sense of timing. The programme ended in 1969, and the character then appeared for a time in the Thames Television children&#x27;s programme &quot;Magpie&quot;. Jason appeared in the BBC comedy series &quot;Hugh and I&quot; in 1967, which starred Hugh Lloyd and Terry Scott as two friends who lived together in South London. He appeared in the &quot;Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased)&quot; episode &quot;That&#x27;s How Murder Snowballs&quot; (1969) as Abel, a framed performer in a major London theatre.

In 1968, Jason was initially cast in the role of Lance Corporal Jones in the Jimmy Perry and David Croft BBC comedy &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;. Croft had been very impressed with Jason and believed that he had the talent to play a man much older than his real age. However, BBC executive Bill Cotton overruled him, casting Clive Dunn because he was better known. According to Jason, &quot;I was cast at 12 o&#x27;clock and sacked by three.&quot; Jason also subsequently missed out on the starring role of Frank Spencer in &quot;Some Mothers Do &#x27;Ave &#x27;Em&quot; in 1973 because BBC executives at the time believed that he lacked &quot;star quality&quot;.

In the 1970s, he also acted in radio comedies, including the weekly topical satire &quot;Week Ending&quot; (in which he regularly played such figures as then UK Foreign Secretary Dr David Owen) and &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; (as the &quot;B Ark Captain&quot; in the sixth episode). Jason also appeared in &quot;The Next Programme Follows Almost Immediately&quot; and made appearances on panel games such as &quot;The Impressionists&quot; as well as his own series, &quot;The Jason Explanation&quot;. In the early 1970s, he appeared in &quot;Mostly Monkhouse&quot;.

Jason appeared on stage in the West End in the farce &quot;No Sex Please, We&#x27;re British&quot; playing Brian Runnicles for 18 months in 1973. He also starred with Valerie Leon in a stage comedy &quot;Darling Mr London&quot; which toured in 1975.

Jason appeared in variety shows as the supporting act of Dick Emery and his performances caught the attention of Ronnie Barker. Jason was recruited to appear in &quot;Hark at Barker&quot; (LWT, 1969), starring opposite Barker&#x27;s Lord Rustless, as Dithers, the 100-year old gardener. There was also a sequel, &quot;His Lordship Entertains&quot; (1972) for the BBC. Jason played idealistic employee Granville in the first programme of the comedy anthology &quot;Seven of One&quot; (1973), called &quot;Open All Hours&quot; (BBC) and starring Barker as the curmudgeonly proprietor of a corner shop.

Four series of &quot;Open All Hours&quot; were made from 1976 to 1985. He featured in Barker&#x27;s &quot;Porridge&quot; (BBC), a prison comedy, as the elderly Blanco in three episodes. Jason also appeared with Barker in various disguises in &quot;The Two Ronnies,&quot; including providing the &quot;raspberry&quot; sound effect for &quot;The Phantom Raspberry Blower of Old London Town.&quot;

Jason starred in London Weekend Television&#x27;s &quot;Lucky Feller&quot; (1975–76), written by Terence Frisby and produced by Humphrey Barclay. About two brothers in south-east London, the series was in many ways a forerunner to &quot;Only Fools And Horses&quot;. He played the lead role of Peter Barnes in the ATV sitcom &quot;A Sharp Intake of Breath&quot; (1977–81), alongside Alun Armstrong and Richard Wilson. In 1979, he appeared as Buttons in the pantomime &quot;Cinderella&quot; at Newcastle&#x27;s Theatre Royal, starring Leah Bell and Bobby Thompson, produced by Michael Grayson and directed by John Blackmore.

===Children&#x27;s television===
In the 1980s, Jason developed a working partnership with Cosgrove Hall, and was a voice-over artist for a number of children&#x27;s television productions. This included voices for &quot;Danger Mouse&quot;, &quot;The BFG&quot;, &quot;Count Duckula&quot;, Hugo from &quot;Victor and Hugo&quot;, and Toad from &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot;, all produced by Cosgrove Hall for Thames Television/ITV. He provided the voice of Father Christmas in &quot;Father Christmas and the Missing Reindeer&quot;, Rola Polar in &quot;The Adventures of Dawdle the Donkey&quot;, &quot;Angelmouse&quot;, and did voices in animated films including &quot;Wombling Free&quot; and &quot;The Water Babies&quot;.

===Transition into a leading man===

In 1981, Jason was cast as Del Boy Trotter in the BBC situation comedy &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot;, created by John Sullivan. Del is a wide boy who makes a dishonest living in Peckham, south London, trading in broken, stolen, and counterfeit goods. He is assisted by his brother Rodney (played by Nicholas Lyndhurst) and Grandad (played by Lennard Pearce) and, in later episodes, Uncle Albert (played by Buster Merryfield).

In 1989, Jason starred as Ted Simcock in the ITV drama series &quot;A Bit of a Do&quot;, aired from January to December.

In 1999, Jason starred as Captain Frank Beck in BBC&#x27;s feature-length drama &quot;All the King&#x27;s Men&quot; about the Sandringham regiment lost in World War I. He earned acclaim for a string of serious roles. These include Skullion in &quot;Porterhouse Blue&quot; (for Channel 4), Sidney &quot;Pop&quot; Larkin in the rural idyll &quot;The Darling Buds of May&quot; (Yorkshire Television/ITV), based on the H. E. Bates novel, which also featured Catherine Zeta-Jones.

In 1992, he signed a golden handcuffs deal with ITV to star as Detective Inspector Jack Frost in the long-running TV series &quot;A Touch of Frost&quot; (Yorkshire Television/ITV). In September 2006, he was voted by the general public as No. 1 in ITV&#x27;s poll of TV&#x27;s Greatest Stars. In December 2006, he starred in &quot;Terry Pratchett&#x27;s Hogfather&quot; on Sky1 as Albert. In early 2007, he starred in &quot;Diamond Geezer&quot; (Granada Television/ITV). This series ran for 3 episodes of 90 minutes each. There was a pilot in 2005. In March 2008, he starred as Rincewind in &quot;Terry Pratchett&#x27;s The Colour of Magic&quot;, and in the two part ITV drama &quot;Ghostboat&quot;.

On 16 September 2008, Jason announced that he would step down from his role as Jack Frost after 16 years. Three new episodes of the show were shown in autumn 2008, and were followed by a two-part finale in 2010. Approached by BBC1 controller Danny Cohen in early 2011, he read three scripts and agreed to shoot a pilot for &quot;The Royal Bodyguard&quot;, which was shown at the Edinburgh Film Festival. The pilot episode aired on the BBC on Boxing Day but received a poor critical response. The series was axed after six episodes. In 2010, Jason starred in a made-for-TV movie &quot;Come Rain Come Shine&quot; with Alison Steadman for ITV about an elderly Millwall supporter.

Since 2013, he has starred in &quot;Still Open All Hours&quot;. It features many original cast members (and a portrait of Ronnie Barker as Arkwright) and is still written by Roy Clarke, the original writer and creator of the show. He has also starred as Captain Skipper, a sea captain, sea dog and Pip&#x27;s uncle in the animated series &quot;Pip Ahoy!&quot;.

In December 2021, Jason made a surprise cameo appearance on the Christmas Special of &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; in the role of Del Boy to pass on a special message to &quot;The Repair Shop&quot;&#x27;s Jay Blades, who was performing to the &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; theme tune.

==Honours==
In 1993, Jason was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE). Twelve years later, in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours List of 2005, he was knighted for services to acting and comedy. Upon receiving the knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace on 1 December 2005, he said he was &quot;humbled&quot; by the &quot;fantastic tribute&quot;.

==Personal life==
Jason lived with his long-term girlfriend, Welsh actress Myfanwy Talog, for 18 years and nursed her through breast cancer until she died in 1995.

On 26 February 2001, Jason became a father at the age of 61 when his girlfriend, 41-year-old Gill Hinchcliffe, gave birth to a girl in Stoke Mandeville Hospital, Aylesbury. Jason and Hinchcliffe married in 2005 and live in Ellesborough, Buckinghamshire.

In 2022, Jason discovered that he had another daughter, of whom he had been previously unaware, who was born in 1970 following a brief relationship with actress Jennifer Hill.

Jason is a patron of the Shark Trust, a United Kingdom registered charity working to advance the worldwide conservation of sharks through science, education, influence and action. He has also been Honorary Vice Patron of the Royal International Air Tattoo since 1999, and on 29 May 2014, presented a cheque on behalf of the Fairford-based &quot;RAF Charitable Trust&quot; for £125,000 to the British RAF Air Cadet Organisation, to fund flight simulators for Air Cadets. Jason is a qualified helicopter pilot.

Jason has expressed a negative opinion of the European Union, being quoted in a 2012 interview with &quot;the Germans want to run Europe. The irony is that here we are, the world has changed, and the Germans want to run Europe. They failed to do it by war, twice. What is it? Is this the Fourth Reich?&quot;

In October 2013, he released his autobiography called &quot;David Jason: My Life&quot;. It was shortlisted for the 2013 Specsavers National Book Awards &quot;Best Book of the Year&quot;. A second volume, &quot;Only Fools and Stories: From Del Boy to Granville, Pop Larkin to Frost&quot;, was published in October 2017. Penguin Books announced &quot;A Del Of A Life&quot;, which is Jason&#x27;s third autobiography and was published in October 2020.

In September 2017, it was reported that a &quot;credible threat was made to his life&quot;, although it is not known why Jason had been targeted.

<doc id="51803" wikidata="Q794072" url="?curid=51803" title="Azotemia">
<text>Azotemia (), also spelled azotaemia, is a medical condition characterized by abnormally high levels of nitrogen-containing compounds (such as urea, creatinine, various body waste compounds, and other nitrogen-rich compounds) in the blood. It is largely related to insufficient or dysfunctional filtering of blood by the kidneys. It can lead to uremia and acute kidney injury (kidney failure) if not controlled.

==Types==
Azotemia has three classifications, depending on its causative origin: prerenal azotemia, renal azotemia, and postrenal azotemia.

Measurements of urea and creatinine (Cr) in the blood are used to assess renal function. For historical reasons, the lab test measuring urea is known as &quot;blood urea nitrogen&quot; (BUN) in the US. The BUN:Cr ratio is a useful measure in determining the type of azotemia and will be discussed in each section below. A normal BUN:Cr is equal to 15.

===Prerenal azotemia===
Prerenal azotemia is caused by a decrease in blood flow (hypoperfusion) to the kidneys. However, there is no inherent kidney disease. It can occur following hemorrhage, shock, volume depletion, congestive heart failure, adrenal insufficiency, and narrowing of the renal artery among other things.

The BUN:Cr in prerenal azotemia is greater than 20. The reason for this lies in the mechanism of filtration of urea and creatinine. Renal Plasma Flow (RPF) is decreased due to hypoperfusion which results in a proportional decrease in Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR). In turn, the decreased flow and pressure to the kidney will be sensed by baroreceptors in the Juxtaglomerular (JG) Cells of the afferent arteriole. If the decrease in blood pressure is systemic (rather than occlusion of the renal artery), baroreceptors in the carotid sinus and aortic arch will be stimulated. This leads to sympathetic nerve activation, resulting in renin secretion through β1 receptors. Constriction of the afferent arterioles causes a decrease in the intraglomerular pressure, reducing GFR proportionally. Renin is the main effector of the juxtaglomerular baroreceptors. Renin is secreted from granules in the JG cells, and once in the blood stream, it acts as a protease to convert angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is converted by angiotensin converting enzyme, to angiotensin II, which, in turn, stimulates aldosterone release. Increased aldosterone levels results in salt and water absorption in the distal collecting tubule.

A decrease in volume or pressure is a non-osmotic stimulus for antidiuretic hormone production in the hypothalamus, which exerts its effect in the medullary collecting duct for water reabsorption. Through unknown mechanisms, activation of the sympathetic nervous system leads to enhanced proximal tubular reabsorption of salt and water, as well as urea (BUN), calcium, uric acid, and bicarbonate. The net result of these 4 mechanisms of salt and water retention is decreased output and decreased urinary excretion of sodium (&lt; 20mEq/L). The increased reabsorption of Na leads to increased water and urea reabsorption from the proximal tubules of the kidney back into the blood. In contrast, creatinine is actually secreted in the proximal tubule. This generally leads to a BUN:Cr ratio greater than 20, a fractional excretion of Na of less than 1%, and an elevated urine osmolarity.

=== Primary renal azotemia ===
Renal azotemia (acute kidney failure) typically leads to uremia. It is an intrinsic disease of the kidney, generally the result of kidney parenchymal damage. Causes include kidney failure, glomerulonephritis, acute tubular necrosis, or other kidney disease.

The BUN:Cr in renal azotemia is less than 15. In cases of kidney disease, glomerular filtration rate decreases, so nothing gets filtered as well as it normally would. However, in addition to not being normally filtered, what urea does get filtered is not reabsorbed by the proximal tubule as it normally would be. This results in lower levels of urea in the blood and higher levels of urea in the urine as compared to creatinine. Creatinine filtration decreases, leading to a higher amount of creatinine in the blood. Third-spacing of fluids, as in peritonitis, osmotic diuresis, or low aldosterone states such as Addison&#x27;s disease all elevate urea.

===Postrenal azotemia===
Blockage of urine flow in an area below the kidneys results in postrenal azotemia. It can be caused by congenital abnormalities such as vesicoureteral reflux, blockage of the ureters by kidney stones, pregnancy, compression of the ureters by cancer, prostatic hyperplasia, or blockage of the urethra by kidney or bladder stones. Like in prerenal azotemia, there is no inherent renal disease. The increased resistance to urine flow can cause back up into the kidneys, leading to hydronephrosis.

The BUN:Cr in postrenal azotemia is initially &gt;15. The increased nephron tubular pressure (due to fluid back-up) causes increased reabsorption of urea, elevating it abnormally relative to creatinine. Persistent obstruction damages the tubular epithelium over time, and renal azotemia will result with a decreased BUN:Cr ratio.

==Signs and symptoms==
* Oliguria or anuria (decreased or absent urine output)
* Fatigue
* Asterixis (flapping tremor)
* Decreased alertness
* Confusion
* Pale skin
* Tachycardia (rapid pulse)
* Xerostomia (dry mouth)
* Thirst
* Edema, anasarca (swelling)
* Orthostatic blood pressure (fluctuates depending on body position)
* Uremic frost, a condition that occurs when urea and urea derivatives are secreted through the skin in sweat, which evaporates away to leave solid uric compounds, resembling a frost.

A urinalysis will typically show a decreased urine sodium level, a high urine creatinine-to-serum creatinine ratio, a high urine urea-to-serum urea ratio, and concentrated urine (determined by osmolality and specific gravity). None of these is particularly useful in diagnosis.

In pre-renal and post-renal azotemias, elevation of urea exceeds that of the creatinine (i.e., BUN&gt;12*creatinine). This is because urea is readily reabsorbed by the kidneys while creatinine is not. In congestive heart failure (a cause of pre-renal azotemia) or any other condition that causes poor perfusion of kidneys, the sluggish flow of glomerular filtrate results in excessive absorption of urea and elevation of its value in blood. Creatinine, however, is not absorbable and therefore does not rise significantly. Stasis of urine in post-renal azotemia has the same effect.

==Treatment==
Prompt treatment of some causes of azotemia can result in restoration of kidney function; delayed treatment may result in permanent loss of renal function. Treatment may include hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, medications to increase cardiac output and increase blood pressure, and the treatment of the condition that caused the azotemia.

<text>Stars and Stripes is a daily American military newspaper reporting on matters concerning the members of the United States Armed Forces and their communities, with an emphasis on those serving outside the United States. It operates from inside the Department of Defense, but is editorially separate from it, and its First Amendment protection is safeguarded by the United States Congress to whom an independent ombudsman, who serves the readers&#x27; interests, regularly reports. As well as a website, &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; publishes a global daily print edition for U.S. military service members serving overseas Monday through Friday. This global edition is also available as a free download in electronic format. The newspaper has its headquarters in Washington, D.C.

== History ==

=== Creation ===
On November 9, 1861, during the Civil War, soldiers of the 11th, 18th, and 29th Illinois Regiments set up camp in the Missouri city of Bloomfield. Finding the local newspaper&#x27;s office empty, they decided to print a newspaper about their activities. They called it the &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot;. Tradition holds this as the origin story for the newspaper, and the Stars and Stripes Museum/Library Association is located in Bloomfield.

=== World War I ===
During World War I, the staff, roving reporters, and illustrators of the &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; were veteran reporters or young soldiers who would later become such in the post-war years. It was published by the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) from February 8, 1918, to June 13, 1919. Harold Ross, editor of the &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot;, returned home to found &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine. Cyrus Baldridge, its art director and principal illustrator, became a major illustrator of books and magazines, as well as a writer, print maker and stage designer. Sports page editor Grantland Rice had a long career in journalism and founded a motion picture studio called Grantland Rice Sportlight. Drama critic Alexander Woollcott&#x27;s essays for &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; were collected in his 1919 book, &quot;The Command Is Forward&quot;.

The &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; was then an eight-page weekly which reached a peak of 526,000 readers, relying on the improvisational efforts of its staff to get it printed in France and distributed to U.S. troops.

=== World War II ===
During World War II, the newspaper was printed in dozens of editions in several operating theaters. Again, both newspapermen in uniform and young soldiers, some of whom would later become important journalists, filled the staffs. Some of the editions were assembled and printed very close to the front in order to get the latest information to the most troops. Also, during the war, the newspaper published the 53-book series &quot;G.I. Stories&quot;.

After Bill Mauldin did his popular &quot;Up Front&quot; cartoons for the World War II &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot;, he returned home to a successful career as an editorial cartoonist and two-time winner of the Pulitzer Prize. Pulitzer Prize-winning American journalist and war correspondent Ernie Pyle was regularly published in the &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; before he was killed by a Japanese machine-gunner on Iejima during the Battle of Okinawa.

The magazine frequently posted photographs of a young Marilyn Monroe, then known as Norma Jeane Dougherty, which later led her as being named &quot;Miss Cheesecake 1952&quot; by &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot;.

=== Modern era ===

Funding and relevance in the digital age have threatened the paper&#x27;s budget. In 2013, the paper faced job cuts, printing-schedule changes, a pay-raise freeze and travel limitations for staff under the Federal budget sequestration. The print newspapers provide the news back home to service members who are forward-deployed in areas lacking reliable internet access. Coverage of pay and benefits is of direct concern to service members and their families along with life on base and in the field. The paper helps them be better-informed citizens about global geopolitics. Budget cuts by the Pentagon were again considered in 2016.

The &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; reported in February 2020, that a draft budget would reduce the newspaper&#x27;s federal support in 2021 under a $5 billion shift to higher priorities in the defense budget. Deputy Under Secretary of Defense Elaine McCusker indicated its funding would be cut and said: &quot;We have essentially decided that, you know, kind of coming into the modern age that newspaper is probably not the best way that we communicate any longer.&quot; The subsidy is more than $15 million a year, which represents approximately half the publication&#x27;s budget and roughly 0.002 percent of the Department of Defense budget, which was $721,500 million in 2020. It was described by the &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; ombudsman as &quot;a fatal cut&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;WP 2020/06/18&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In September, Defense Secretary Mark Esper justified the decision to discontinue publication of the paper as a result of his department-wide budget review. An order for the newspaper to shutter was issued, specifically by presenting a plan for it to dissolve by September 15, including &quot;specific timeline for vacating government owned/leased space worldwide&quot; and to end publication by September 30, 2020. Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) led a bipartisan group opposed to the move, including Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), a veteran, and Susan Collins (R-ME). On September 4, US president Donald Trump appeared to reverse this position by tweeting that funding would not be cut. On September 30 the order to close was rescinded.

==Operations==
&quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; is authorized by Congress and the US Department of Defense to produce independent daily military news and information distributed at U.S. military installations in Europe and Mideast and East Asia. A weekly derivative product is distributed within the United States by its commercial publishing partners. &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; newspaper averages 32 pages each day and is published in tabloid format and online at www.stripes.com/epaper. With the website, a social media presence and a couple of podcasts, it is a modern multimedia operation. &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; employs civilian reporters, and U.S. military senior non-commissioned officers as reporters, at a number of locations around the world, and on any given day has an audience just shy of 1.0 million. &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; also serves independent military news and information to an online audience of about 2.0 million unique visitors per month, 60 to 70 percent of whom are located in the United States.

&quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; is a non-appropriated fund (NAF) organization, only partially subsidized by the Department of Defense. A large portion of its operating costs is earned through the sale of advertising and subscriptions but it relies on government funding to back overseas reporting and distribution. Unique among the many military publications, &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; operates as a First Amendment newspaper and is part of the Defense Media Activity, formed in 2005. The other entities encompassed by the Defense Media Activity (the DoD News Channel and Armed Forces Radio and Television Service, for example), are command publications of the Department of Defense; only &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; maintains complete editorial independence.

&quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; is in the process of digitizing its World War II editions. Newspaper microfilm from 1949 to 1999 is now in searchable format through a partnership with Heritage Microfilm and has been integrated into an archives website. Newspaper Archive has also more recently made the England, Ireland and Mediterranean editions from World War II available.

==Former staffers==
The newspaper has been published continuously in Europe since 1942 and in the Pacific since 1945.

Notable former &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; staffers include: CBS &quot;60 Minutes&quot;″ Andy Rooney and Steve Kroft; songwriter and author Shel Silverstein; comic book illustrator Tom Sutton; authors Gustav Hasford and Ralph G. Martin; painter and cartoonist Paul Fontaine; author and television news correspondent Tony Zappone; cartoonist Vernon Grant (&quot;A Monster Is Loose in Tokyo&quot;); Hollywood photographer Phil Stern; and stock market reporter and host of public television&#x27;s &quot;Wall Street Week&quot;, Louis Rukeyser, and the only Black reporter in WWII, Allan Morrison. Patricia Collins Hughes was a former WASP and advocate for WASP veteran status.

==In popular culture==

A photograph in &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; loosely inspired the exploits of PFC Jack Agnew in the 1965 novel and its 1967 film adaptation, &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot;.

American comic strips have been presented in a 15-page section, &quot;Stripes&#x27; Sunday Comics&quot;.Sergeant J.T. &quot;Joker&quot; Davis and Private First Class &quot;Rafterman&quot; are a war correspondent and combat photographer, respectively, stationed in Da Nang for &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; in Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s 1987 film &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot;.

<text>Gustav Alfred Julius Meyer (5 October 1891 – 11 April 1945) was a Nazi Party official and politician. He joined the Nazi Party in 1928 and was the &quot;Gauleiter&quot; of North Westphalia from 1931 to 1945, the &quot;Oberpräsident&quot; of the Province of Westphalia from 1938 to 1945 and the &quot;Reichsstatthalter&quot; of Lippe and Schaumburg-Lippe from 1933 to 1945. In 1941 he became the Permanent Deputy to the &quot;Reichsminister&quot; of the Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories. He represented the ministry with Georg Leibbrandt in the January 1942 Wannsee Conference, at which the genocidal Final Solution to the Jewish Question was planned. Near the end of World War II in Europe, Meyer committed suicide in April 1945.

== Early life ==
Meyer was born in Göttingen, the son of a Prussian civil servant who was stationed there for his official duties. The middle-class family was originally from Essen. He was educated at the Gymnasium in Soest, graduating in 1911. 

A conservative and a monarchist, Meyer aspired to become a Prussian military officer. However, upon graduation, he entered the University of Lausanne to study law. After one term in Lausanne, he unexpectedly received an appointment as a &quot;Fahnenjunker&quot; (cadet officer) with the 68th (6th Rhenish) Infantry Regiment in Koblenz in 1912. He passed his officer exam and was commissioned as a &quot;Leutnant&quot; on 16 June 1913. During World War I he fought with Infantry Regiment 363 on the Western Front, earning the Iron Cross first and second class and the Wound Badge. Promoted to &quot;Oberleutnant&quot; in June 1916, he was wounded and captured by the French in April 1917. This experience, according to Meyer, was especially traumatic and left him with a hatred against France. Released from captivity in March 1920, the downsized &quot;Reichswehr&quot; had no use for him and he left the army in October with the rank of &quot;Hauptmann&quot;.

After the war, Meyer studied jurisprudence and political science at the Universities of Bonn and Würzburg. He graduated with a PhD in 1922 and joined the legal department of a Gelsenkirchen mining firm. In 1924, he joined the local Masonic lodge. Meyer was also the chairman of the local &quot;Kyffhäuserbund&quot; unit. He married Dorothee Capell in 1925 and had five daughters with her.

== Career in Nazi Germany ==
The Nazi Party was still extremely weak in Westphalia during the late 1920s, and had only about three hundred members in the city of Gelsenkirchen during this period. On 1 April 1928, Meyer joined the Party (membership number 28,738). As an early Party member, he would later be awarded the Golden Party Badge. Later that year, he rose to the position of &quot;Ortsgruppenleiter&quot; (Local Group Leader) and, on 1 October 1929, he was promoted to &quot;Bezirksleiter&quot; (District Leader) of the Emscher-Lippe district within Westphalia. In November 1929, he was also elected as the only Nazi party representative to the Gelsenkirchen city council where he remained until January 1931.

In September 1930, Meyer was elected to the &quot;Reichstag&quot; from electoral constituency 17, North Westphalia, and on 31 January 1931, he was appointed the Nazi Party &quot;Gauleiter&quot; of the newly-formed Gau Westphalia-North. He also became the editor of the local Party newspaper, the &quot;Westfälische Landeszeitung Rot-Erde&quot;. On 24 April 1932, he was elected to the Prussian &quot;Landtag&quot;. Following the Nazi seizure of power in 1933, Meyer was appointed to the Westphalia Provincial Landtag on 12 March, becoming its president in April. On 10 April, he was made the province&#x27;s plenipotentiary to the &quot;Reichsrat&quot;, serving until its abolition on 14 February 1934. Adolf Hitler appointed him as the federal &quot;Reichsstatthalter&quot; (Reich Governor) of the German States of Lippe and Schaumburg-Lippe on 16 May 1933. He was returned to the &quot;Reichstag&quot; at the election of 12 November 1933, retaining his seat until the fall of the Nazi regime. On 1 August 1934, he was named to Hans Frank&#x27;s Academy for German Law. Additionally, he also became the &quot;Staatsminister&quot; (Minister of State) in charge of the state government of Lippe, succeeding Hans-Joachim Riecke, effective 1 February 1936. He also was named a Minister of State in the Schaumburg-Lippe government of &quot;Landespräsident&quot; (State President) . Finally, on 4 November 1938 he was made &quot;Oberpräsident&quot; of the Prussian Province of Westphalia, thus uniting under his control the highest party and governmental offices in his jurisdictions. In the Nazi paramilitary organization, the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot;, he was promoted to SA-&quot;Gruppenführer&quot; on 20 April 1936 and to SA-&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot; on 9 November 1938.

On 6 September 1939, Meyer was made &quot;Chef der Zivilverwaltung&quot; (Chief of Civil Administration) in the West. On 29 May 1940 he was appointed Acting Reich Defense Commissioner for Military District VI during the absence in Norway of Josef Terboven. On 17 July 1941 he was named &quot;Ständiger Stellvertreter&quot; (permanent deputy) to &quot;Reichsminister&quot; Alfred Rosenberg in the newly-established Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories (RMO). Meyer was responsible for the departments of politics, administration and economics. In his role in the East, he used workers that were mainly Jewish for slave labor assigned to a variety of works. 

=== Wannsee Conference participant ===

On 20 January 1942, Meyer was Rosenberg&#x27;s representative at the Wannsee Conference, which was called to discuss the implementation of the Final Solution. The official minutes of the conference indicate that Myer and Josef Bühler, the representative of the General Government, both expressed the opinion that preparatory measures for the Final Solution should be carried out immediately in their respective jurisdictions. Nine days after the conference, Myer convened a meeting at the RMO office for representatives of several other ministries and the &quot;armed forces high command&quot; (OKW). The RMO representatives advocated broadening the definition of who was a Jew. They supported the position of SS-&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot; Reinhard Heydrich, who had chaired the Wannsee meeting, that &quot;Mischlinge&quot; of the first degree should be included. Myer wrote a letter on 16 July 1942 proposing that a request be addressed to Hitler urging that a decision be made on the &quot;Mischlinge&quot; question.

== Defeat and death ==
On 16 November 1942, Myer was made Reich Defense Commissioner for his &quot;Gau&quot;. During the war, he was awarded the War Merit Cross, 1st and 2nd class with Swords. On 25 September 1944, he became the commander of Nazi &quot;Volksturm&quot; militia forces in his &quot;Gau&quot;. He made plans to construct a &quot;Westphalia Wall&quot; to serve as a defensive position but the Allied assault proved unstoppable, and Münster fell to the combined British and American forces on 3 April 1945. In mid-May 1945, a body, decomposed beyond recognition but later determined to be Meyer, was found in Hessisch Oldendorf by the River Weser. Next to the body was a pistol and a suicide note, in which the unrepentant Nazi wrote: &quot;The last part of my &quot;Gau&quot; was lost today. We defended Rinteln and the Weser bravely. In the last free part of my &quot;Gau&quot; I take leave of the &quot;Führer&quot;, to whom my most heartfelt wishes belong, [and] of Germany.&quot;

== Fictional portrayals ==
Myer was portrayed by in the 1984 German film &quot;Die Wannseekonferenz&quot;, by Brian Pettifer in the 2001 BBC/HBO film &quot;Conspiracy&quot; and by Peter Jordan in the 2022 German film &quot;Die Wannseekonferenz&quot;.

<text>Anton Herman Gerard &quot;Anthony&quot; Fokker (6 April 1890 – 23 December 1939) was a Dutch aviation pioneer, aviation entrepreneur, aircraft designer, and aircraft manufacturer. He produced fighter aircraft in Germany during the First World War such as the Eindecker monoplanes, the Dr.1 triplane and the D.VII biplane.

After the Treaty of Versailles forbade Germany to produce aircraft, Fokker moved his business to the Netherlands. There, his company was responsible for a variety of aircraft including the Fokker F.VII/3m trimotor, a successful interwar passenger aircraft. He died in New York in 1939. Later authors suggest he was personally charismatic but unscrupulous in business and a controversial character.

==Early life==
Anthony (Tony) Fokker was born in Blitar, Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), to Herman Fokker, a Dutch coffee plantation owner and Johanna Hugona Wouterina Wilhelmina Diemont. Some sources say that he was born in Kediri. At that time, Blitar was a part of the &quot;Kediri Residency&quot;, a colonial administrative division the capital of which was Kediri. He was a cousin of the physicist Adriaan Fokker.

When Fokker was four, the family returned to the Netherlands and settled in Haarlem in order to provide Fokker and his older sister, Toos, with a Dutch upbringing.

Fokker was not a studious boy and did not complete his high school education. However, he showed an early interest in mechanics, and preferred making things, playing with model trains and steam engines, and experimenting with model aeroplane designs.

As a high school student, he devoted considerable effort to the development of a wheel that would not suffer from punctures; basically a wheel with a perimeter formed by a series of metal plates.

==Move to Germany ==

Fokker&#x27;s interest in flight stemmed from Wilbur Wright&#x27;s exhibition flights in France in the summer and fall of 1908. In 1910, aged 20, Fokker was sent by his father to Germany to receive training as an automobile mechanic at Bingen Technical school, but his interest was in flying, so he transferred to the Erste deutsche Automobil-Fachschule in Mainz. That same year Fokker built his first aircraft &quot;de Spin&quot; (&quot;the Spider&quot;), which was destroyed when his business partner flew it into a tree. He gained his flying certificate in his second &quot;&quot;Spin&quot; aircraft, which shortly thereafter was also destroyed by the same business partner, prompting Fokker to end their cooperation. In his own country, he became a celebrity by flying around the tower of the Grote or St.-Bavokerk in Haarlem on 1 September 1911, with the third version of the &quot;Spin&quot;&quot;. One day earlier, on Queen&#x27;s Day (31 August, Queen Wilhelmina&#x27;s birthday), Fokker had already taken the opportunity to make a couple of demonstration flights in Haarlem in the same aircraft.

In 1912, Fokker moved to Johannisthal near Berlin, where he founded his first own company, &quot;Fokker Aeroplanbau&quot;. In the following years he constructed a variety of aircraft. He relocated his factory to Schwerin where it was renamed &quot;Fokker Flugzeugwerke GmbH&quot;, and later shortened to &quot;Fokker Werke GmbH&quot;.

==Involvement in World War I==
At the outbreak of World War I the German government took control of the factory. Fokker remained as director and alleged designer of many aircraft for the Imperial German Army Air Service (&quot;Luftstreitkräfte&quot;), including the Fokker &quot;Eindecker&quot; and the Fokker Dr.I, the triplane made famous in the hands of aces such as Manfred von Richthofen (the Red Baron). In all, his company delivered about 700 military aircraft to the German air force as well as supplying the German navy and Austria-Hungary.

Fokker himself was a skilled pilot, demonstrating his aircraft on many occasions. On 13 June 1915, Fokker demonstrated the new &quot;Eindecker&quot; (monoplane) at Stenay in the German 5th Army Sector in front of the German Crown Prince and other VIPs. Fokker worked closely with an accomplished military pilot, Otto Parschau, to bring the Eindecker into military use and on this occasion both men demonstrated the aircraft. Max Immelmann, later to become a high-scoring flying ace with the &quot;Eindecker&quot;, commented in a letter written shortly after this event on 25 June 1915 that: &quot;Fokker, especially, amazed us with his skill&quot;.

Author A.R. Weyl (&quot;Fokker: The Creative Years&quot;, Putnam 1965) says that, while Fokker was a talented and bold pilot, his business character was more flawed. He failed to reinvest war profits back into his factory which consequently struggled to fulfill contracts as the factory floor was often muddled with prototype development and production taking place at the same time. Fokker distrusted qualified engineers (which he was not), and resented frequent German insistence on carrying out stringent structural tests to ensure prototype aircraft were fit for combat. He could be bad tempered and insensitive, as when he verbally abused his dying designer Martin Kreuzer on the evening of 27 June 1916, after Kreuzer had crashed the prototype Fokker D.I. The rudder jammed, but Kreuzer was able to give an oral report on the accident before he died. &quot;Fokker hurried to the scene, and shouted reproaches at the mortally injured man&quot;. Weyl says this incident was witnessed by Reinhold Platz, who succeeded Kreuzer.

While Weyl&#x27;s biography paints an unpleasant picture of Fokker as a businessman, he was a popular and charismatic figure with service pilots, and could charm even senior officers. This charm enabled him to deal with the first major crisis of his German career when his newly delivered Fokker Dr.I triplanes began to experience sudden fatal accidents in late 1917, and the type was temporarily grounded as too dangerous to fly. The triplanes&#x27; top wings frequently ripped off under aerobatic conditions and even Lothar von Richthofen (brother of Manfred) was lucky to survive one such crash. Fokker was able to prove to the German high command that the basic design was not at fault, but the German military inquiry concluded that shoddy workmanship due to poor supervision and quality control at the Fokker factory were to blame. Fokker received a stern warning about future conduct. Unfortunately the same scenario repeated itself a few months later, with the introduction of his Fokker E.V/D.VIII monoplane in mid-1918. A further high level German inquiry revealed more production and workmanship issues. Weyl asserts that the German authorities were now willing to file criminal charges against Fokker, and might have done so, had he not returned to the Netherlands shortly after the end of World War I.

Fokker&#x27;s own account of the D.VIII places the blame on officious German Air Force inspectors requiring an ill-conceived design change. &quot;When the first D-8 was submitted to the engineering division to be sandload tested, the wings proved to be sufficiently strong, but the regulations called for a proportionate strength in the rear spar compared to the front spar ... Complying with the government&#x27;s edict, we strengthened the rear spar and started to produce in quantity ...&quot; The D.VIIIs immediately ran into trouble with the wing collapsing at high speed. Fokker recalled the aircraft for further testing, and successfully demonstrated that the reinforced rear spar caused the wings to flex unevenly at speed, increasing the angle of attack at the wing tips and causing the wing to shear apart under the increased loads. The problem was resolved by restoring the rear spar to its original specifications.

Weyl also discusses claims of Fokker&#x27;s outright plagiarism or taking sole credit for the work of his staff, first designer Martin Kreuzer and later Reinhold Platz. For example, contemporary German documents for the E.V/D.VIII refer to Fokker as &quot;the designer&quot; but Weyl and other authors now suggest that Platz was the real design genius behind the Dr.I, D.VII and D.VIII. There may be some truth in this as Platz recalled to Weyl that he attended high level meetings alongside Fokker but was never introduced or referred-to as the designer and often never even spoke. Yet when Fokker fled Germany it was Platz who immediately took over the German works on Fokker&#x27;s behalf. Fokker later moved Platz to the Netherlands, as head designer, when the post-war German operation collapsed which indicates Platz really did play a greater design role than Fokker admits. Weyl uncharitably suggests that Platz&#x27;s role at the Fokker D.VIII crisis meetings was to take the blame if anything was wrong and not receive credit. How much of this interpretation is based on the fact that Platz was still alive to tell his side of the story in 1965, and Fokker was not, is unclear.

Another book by Henri Hegener (who knew both Fokker and Platz personally) depicts a rather different story, saying that Platz, while a skilled craftsman (and excellent welder), had received no formal technical training, and that his contributions to the Fokker designs are exaggerated, although Hegener grants that Platz was a good &quot;rule of thumb&quot; designer. Hegener also contradicts the claims that Platz was treated badly by Fokker, at least not financially because Platz&#x27;s year-end bonuses often exceeded his yearly salary.

==The interrupter gear==

Fokker is often credited with having invented the synchronization device which enabled World War I aircraft to fire through the spinning propeller. His role was certainly significant, but there were a number of prior developments before the result was achieved for which Fokker is commonly credited.

The famous French pilot Roland Garros was shot down on 18 April 1915. His aircraft had been fitted with a deflector device, whereby metal deflector wedges were fitted to the propeller. Garros was able to set fire to the airframe before being taken prisoner but the aircraft&#x27;s gun and the armoured propeller remained intact and came into German hands.

This initiated a phase of consideration of the interrupter gear concept in the Imperial German Army Air Service (&quot;Luftstreitkräfte&quot;). Fokker was heavily involved in this process but the story of his conception, development and installation of a synchronization device in a period of 48 hours (first found in an authorized biography of Fokker written in 1929) has been shown to be not factual. The available evidence points to a synchronisation device having been in development with Fokker&#x27;s company for perhaps six months prior to the capture of Garros&#x27; machine. Additionally there were patents filed in France, Germany and Austria-Hungary as far back as 1910 which show a very similar device to that pioneered by Fokker. Author A. J. Weyl suggests that Fokker – or more probably someone on his production team – was aware of these patents. One patentee, Franz Schneider and his employer LVG, later sued Fokker in the German courts and won their case; but Fokker (by now in America) refused to pay up.

However, the final result of the development was Fokker&#x27;s pushrod control mechanism, &quot;Gestängesteuerung&quot;, which allowed the aircraft&#x27;s forward-firing machine gun to fire only when the propeller was out of the line of fire. As incorporated into the famous Fokker &quot;Eindecker&quot;, its use directly led to a phase of German air superiority known as the Fokker Scourge. Despite its shock effect on the enemy, the first Fokker interrupters remained unreliable and were prone to failures. Both Oswald Boelcke and Max Immelmann survived failures which resulted in propellers being shot off and even engines pulled out of their mountings due to the engine becoming unbalanced by the loss of the propeller. Immelmann&#x27;s eventual death in combat has also been attributed to interrupter gear failure as the aircraft was seen to break up in mid-air while engaged against a Royal Flying Corps F.E.2b.

==Other works on aircraft armament==
Fokker and his armament team, including Lübbe and Leimberger, also worked on lesser known projects, including a multi-barrelled machine gun, known as the Fokker-Leimberger. Although superficially similar to a Gatling gun, the action of the Fokker-Leimberger was substantially different. Problems with the gun, especially with ruptured cases, prevented its adoption into production during the war. After moving to the US, Fokker continued to work on the design, but he was ultimately unsuccessful—properly sealing the rotary split-breech was apparently very difficult. A single surviving prototype is known today at the Kentucky Military Treasures.

==Return to the Netherlands==
After the war&#x27;s end, the terms of the Treaty of Versailles forbade Germany to build any aircraft or aircraft engines. The Armistice, not the Treaty of Versailles, singled out the Fokker D.VII for destruction or confiscation, the only aircraft to be so named. In 1919, Fokker returned to the Netherlands and started a new aircraft company, the &quot;Nederlandse Vliegtuigenfabriek&quot; (Dutch Aircraft Factory), predecessor to the Fokker Aircraft Company. Despite the strict disarmament conditions in the treaty, Fokker did not return home empty-handed: he managed to smuggle six goods trains&#x27; worth of D.VII and C.I military aircraft and spare parts out of Germany across the German-Dutch border. Author Weyl says that Fokker used 350 railway wagons and made sure that each train was too long to fit into the railway sidings where trains were normally checked for contraband. Weyl quotes Fokker himself as saying that he paid 20,000 Dutch guilders in bribes. The trains included 220 aeroplanes, more than 400 aero engines and much other material. This initial stock enabled him to quickly set up shop, but his focus shifted from military to civil aircraft such as the very successful Fokker F.VII/3m trimotor.

Fokker&#x27;s admitted bribery has contributed to his reputation for sharp business practices. Weyl also points out that – in addition to possible criminal charges for the Fokker D.VIII fatal crashes – Fokker also failed to pay taxes to German authorities, and actually owed more than 14 million Marks. Fokker&#x27;s autobiography tells a similar story, but focuses on the rampant corruption, hyper-inflation, economic meltdown, and violent revolutionary forces of the pre-Weimar days. According to Fokker&#x27;s account, as WWI progressed, the German High Command became increasingly brazen, even forcing Fokker into German citizenship against his will. Fokker describes his escape from Germany as a harrowing tale in which he protected as many workers as possible and escaped with less than a quarter of his net worth. He takes pains to rebuff the claim that he left the country owing any taxes.

==Personal life==
On 25 March 1919, Fokker married Sophie Marie Elisabeth von Morgen in Haarlem. This marriage ended in divorce in 1923. In 1927, he married Canadian Violet Austman in New York City. On 8 February 1929, she died in a fall from their hotel suite window. The original police report said her death was a suicide, but this was later changed to &quot;vertigo victim&quot; at the request of her husband&#x27;s staff. On the subject of his marriages, Fokker wrote, &quot;I have always understood airplanes much better than women. I had more love affairs in my life, and they ended just like the first one, really, because I thought there was nothing that could be more important than my airplanes ... I have now learned, by bitter experience, that one must give a little too; in love one has to use one&#x27;s brain just as much as in business, and perhaps even more&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;HegenerFOKKER1961/2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Move to the US and death==
In or about 1926 or 1927, Fokker moved to the United States. Here he established the North American branch of his company, the Atlantic Aircraft Corporation. The company gained high visibility in daring exploits by pilots. The Fokker F.VII aircraft was used by pilot Richard E. Byrd and machinist Floyd Bennett to fly over or near the North Pole on 9 May 1926. In June 1928, Amelia Earhart crossed the Atlantic to Wales in a Fokker F.VII/3m trimotor, and in 1930 Charles Kingsford Smith circumnavigated the globe in another. However the reputation was hurt when the famous University of Notre Dame football coach Knute Rockne was killed in the crash of a Fokker F.10A in March 1931.

Fokker&#x27;s Dutch and American companies were at the peak of their success in the late 1920s, but he lost control by going public to sell stock. In 1929, General Motors took over Fokker Aircraft Corporation of America, and merged it in the General Aviation Corporation. Fokker was appointed director of engineering. He resigned in 1931. Fokker designs were increasingly outdated and in 1934 General Aviation discontinued their production. They were still built in the Netherlands.

Neville Shute in 1934 negotiated with Fokker for a manufacturing licensing agreement for Airspeed Ltd (England), and found him &quot;genial, shrewd and helpful&quot; but &quot;already a sick man&quot;; and he was difficult to deal with as &quot;his domestic life was irregular&quot;. He worked &quot;at all hours and in strange places&quot;. Frequently &quot;his very efficient legal advisor and secretary could not tell us where he was&quot;. Shute said he was &quot;a good chooser of men&quot; and had a &quot;most efficient staff of Dutchmen and ex-Germans&quot;.

Fokker died at age 49 in New York in 1939 from pneumococcal meningitis, after a three-week-long illness. In 1940, his ashes were brought to Westerveld Cemetery in Driehuis, North Holland, where they were buried in the family grave.

In 1970, Fokker was inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame.

In 1980, Fokker was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in Dayton, Ohio. 

==Popular culture==
Fokker&#x27;s nickname was &quot;The Flying Dutchman&quot;. In popular media, Hurd Hatfield portrayed him in the 1971 film &quot;Von Richthofen and Brown&quot;. The character Roy Fokker from the animated series &quot;Super Dimension Fortress Macross&quot; and its prequel &quot;Macross Zero&quot; was named in honor of Anthony Fokker and Roy Brown, the Royal Air Force pilot who is officially credited with downing Manfred von Richthofen&#x27;s Fokker Dr.I. Fokker is portrayed by Craig Kelly in the &quot;Young Indiana Jones Chronicles: Attack of the Hawkmen&quot;.

One of KLM&#x27;s Boeing 747-200s, registration serial PH-BUN, was named after Fokker and operated for the airline from 1979 until 2004. The aircraft was scrapped after the end of its service with KLM.

==Television series==
&quot;Turbulent Skies&quot; is a 2020 Dutch television series comprising eight episodes depicting Anthony Fokker&#x27;s and Albert Plesman&#x27;s achievements.

<text>The Fokker Dr.I (&quot;Dreidecker&quot;, &quot;triplane&quot; in German), often known simply as the Fokker Triplane, was a World War I fighter aircraft built by Fokker-Flugzeugwerke. The Dr.I saw widespread service in the spring of 1918. It became famous as the aircraft in which Manfred von Richthofen gained his last 17 victories (plus two earlier ones in the Fokker F.I prototype in September 1917), and in which he was killed on 21 April 1918. The Fokker Dr.I was flown with great success by many German aces, most notably Josef Jacobs with 30 confirmed kills in the type.

==Design and development==
In February 1917, the Sopwith Triplane began to appear over the Western Front. Despite its single Vickers machine gun armament, the Sopwith swiftly proved itself superior to the more heavily armed Albatros fighters then in use by the &quot;Luftstreitkräfte&quot;. In April 1917, Anthony Fokker viewed a captured Sopwith Triplane while visiting &quot;Jasta&quot; 11. Upon his return to the Schwerin factory, Fokker instructed Reinhold Platz to build a triplane, but gave him no further information about the Sopwith design. Platz responded with the V.4, a small, rotary-powered triplane with a steel tube fuselage and thick cantilever wings, first developed during Fokker&#x27;s government-mandated collaboration with Hugo Junkers. Initial tests revealed that the V.4 had unacceptably high control forces resulting from the use of unbalanced ailerons and elevators.

Instead of submitting the V.4 for a type test, Fokker produced a revised prototype designated V.5. The most notable changes were the introduction of horn-balanced ailerons and elevators, as well as longer-span wings. The V.5 also featured interplane struts, which were not necessary from a structural standpoint, but which minimized wing flexing. On 14 July 1917, &quot;Idflieg&quot; issued an order for 20 pre-production aircraft. The V.5 prototype, serial 101/17, was tested to destruction at Adlershof on 11 August 1917.

==Operational history==

The first two pre-production triplanes were designated F.I, in accord with &quot;Idflieg&#x27;s&quot; early class prefix for triplanes. These aircraft, serials 102/17 and 103/17, were the only machines to receive the F.I designation and could be distinguished from subsequent aircraft by a slight convex curve. The two aircraft were sent to &quot;Jastas&quot; 10 and 11 for combat evaluation, arriving at Markebeeke, Belgium on 28 August 1917.

Richthofen first flew 102/17 on 1 September 1917 and shot down two enemy aircraft in the next two days. He reported to the &quot;Kogenluft&quot; (&quot;Kommandierender General der Luftstreitkräfte&quot;) that the F.I was superior to the Sopwith Triplane. Richthofen recommended that fighter squadrons be reequipped with the new aircraft as soon as possible. The combat evaluation came to an abrupt conclusion when &quot;Oberleutnant&quot; Kurt Wolff, &quot;Staffelführer&quot; of &quot;Jasta&quot; 11, was shot down in 102/17 on 15 September, and &quot;Leutnant&quot; Werner Voss, &quot;Staffelführer&quot; of &quot;Jasta&quot; 10, was killed in 103/17 on 23 September.

The remaining pre-production aircraft, designated Dr.I, were delivered to &quot;Jasta&quot; 11. &quot;Idflieg&quot; issued a production order for 100 triplanes in September, followed by an order for 200 in November. Apart from the straight leading edge of the tailplane, these aircraft were almost identical to the F.I. The primary distinguishing feature was the addition of wingtip skids, which proved necessary because the aircraft was tricky to land and prone to ground looping. In October, Fokker began delivering the Dr.I to squadrons within Richthofen&#x27;s &quot;Jagdgeschwader&quot; I.

Compared with the Albatros and Pfalz fighters, the Dr.I offered exceptional maneuverability. Though the ailerons were not very effective, the rudder and elevator controls were light and powerful. Rapid turns, especially to the right, were facilitated by the triplane&#x27;s marked directional instability. &quot;Vizefeldwebel&quot; Franz Hemer of &quot;Jasta&quot; 6 said, &quot;The triplane was my favorite fighting machine because it had such wonderful flying qualities. I could let myself stunt – looping and rolling – and could avoid an enemy by diving with perfect safety. The triplane had to be given up because although it was very maneuverable, it was no longer fast enough.&quot;

As Hemer noted, the Dr.I was considerably slower than contemporary Allied fighters in level flight and in a dive. While initial rate of climb was excellent, performance fell off dramatically at higher altitudes because of the low compression of the Oberursel Ur.II, a clone of the Le Rhône 9J rotary engine. As the war continued, chronic shortages of castor oil made rotary operation increasingly difficult. The poor quality of German &quot;ersatz&quot; lubricant resulted in many engine failures, particularly during the summer of 1918.

The Dr.I suffered other deficiencies. The pilot&#x27;s view was poor during takeoff and landing. The cockpit was cramped and furnished with materials of inferior quality. Furthermore, the proximity of the gun butts to the cockpit, combined with inadequate crash padding, left the pilot vulnerable to serious head injury in the event of a crash landing.

===Wing failures===

On 29 October 1917, &quot;Leutnant der Reserve&quot; Heinrich Gontermann, &quot;Staffelführer&quot; of &quot;Jasta&quot; 15, was performing aerobatics when his triplane broke up. Gontermann was killed in the ensuing crash landing. &quot;Leutnant der Reserve&quot; Günther Pastor of &quot;Jasta&quot; 11 was killed two days later when his triplane broke up in level flight. Inspection of the wrecked aircraft showed that the wings had been poorly constructed. Examination of other high-time triplanes confirmed these findings. On 2 November, &quot;Idflieg&quot; grounded all remaining triplanes pending an inquiry. &quot;Idflieg&quot; convened a &quot;Sturzkommission&quot; (crash commission) which concluded that poor construction and lack of waterproofing had allowed moisture to damage the wing structure. This caused the wing ribs to disintegrate and the ailerons to break away in flight.

In response to the crash investigation, Fokker was forced to improve quality control on the production line, particularly varnishing of the wing spars and ribs, to combat moisture. Fokker also strengthened the rib structures and the attachment of the auxiliary spars to the ribs. Existing triplanes were repaired and modified at Fokker&#x27;s expense. After testing a modified wing at Adlershof, &quot;Idflieg&quot; authorized the triplane&#x27;s return to service on 28 November 1917. Production resumed in early December. By January 1918, &quot;Jastas&quot; 6 and 11 were fully equipped with the triplane. Only 14 squadrons used the Dr.I as their primary equipment. Most of these units were part of &quot;Jagdgeschwadern&quot; I, II, or III. Frontline inventory peaked in late April 1918, with 171 aircraft in service on the Western Front.

Despite corrective measures, the Dr.I continued to suffer from wing failures. On 3 February 1918, &quot;Leutnant&quot; Hans Joachim Wolff of &quot;Jasta&quot; 11 successfully landed after suffering a failure of the upper wing leading edge and ribs. On 18 March 1918, Lothar von Richthofen, &quot;Staffelführer&quot; of &quot;Jasta&quot; 11, suffered a failure of the upper wing leading edge during combat with Sopwith Camels of No. 73 Squadron and Bristol F.2Bs of No. 62 Squadron. Richthofen was seriously injured in the ensuing crash landing.

Postwar research revealed that poor workmanship was not the only cause of the triplane&#x27;s structural failures. In 1929, National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) investigations found that the upper wing carried a higher lift coefficient than the lower wing – at high speeds it could be 2.55 times as much.

The triplane&#x27;s chronic structural problems destroyed any prospect of large-scale orders. Production eventually ended in May 1918, by which time only 320 had been manufactured. The Dr.I was withdrawn from frontline service as the Fokker D.VII entered widespread service in June and July. &quot;Jasta&quot; 19 was the last squadron to be fully equipped with the Dr.I.

Surviving triplanes were distributed to training and home defense units. Several training aircraft were reengined with the 75 kW (100 hp) Goebel Goe.II. At the time of the Armistice, many remaining triplanes were assigned to fighter training schools at Nivelles, Belgium, and Valenciennes, France. Allied pilots tested several of these triplanes and found their handling qualities to be impressive.
===Experimental engines===
Several Dr.Is were used as testbeds for experimental engines. One aircraft, designated V.7, was fitted with the Siemens-Halske Sh.III bi-rotary engine. The V.7 exhibited exceptional rate of climb and ceiling, but it proved difficult to handle. Serial 108/17 was used to test the 118 kW (160 hp) Goebel Goe. III, while serial 469/17 was used to test the 108 kW (145 hp) Oberursel Ur. III. None of these engines were used on production aircraft. One triplane was used as a testbed for an experimental Schwade gear-driven supercharger.

==Postwar==
Three triplanes are known to have survived the Armistice. Serial 528/17 was retained as a testbed by the &quot;Deutschen Versuchsanstalt für Luftfahrt&quot; (German Aviation Research Institute) at Adlershof. After being used in the filming of two movies, 528/17 is believed to have crashed sometime in the late 1930s. Serial 152/17, in which Manfred von Richthofen obtained three victories, was displayed at the &quot;Zeughaus&quot; museum in Berlin. This aircraft was destroyed in an Allied bombing raid during World War II.

In 1932, Fokker assembled a Dr.I from existing components. It was displayed in the &quot;Deutsche Luftfahrt-Sammlung&quot; in Berlin. In 1943, the aircraft was destroyed in an Allied bombing raid. Today, only a few original Dr.I artifacts survive in museums.

==Replica and reproduction aircraft==

Large numbers of replica and reproduction aircraft have been built for both individuals and museums. Bitz Flugzeugbau GmbH built two Dr.I replicas, serial numbers 001 and 002, for use in Twentieth Century Fox’s 1966 film &quot;The Blue Max&quot;. Replica 001 EI-APW is the oldest surviving example of the Dr.1. Because of the expense and scarcity of authentic rotary engines, most airworthy replicas are powered by a Warner Scarab or Continental R-670 radial engine. A few, however, feature vintage Le Rhône 9J or reproduction Oberursel Ur.II rotary engines.

<text>An amphora (; ; English ) is a type of container with a pointed bottom and characteristic shape and size which fit tightly (and therefore safely) against each other in storage rooms and packages, tied together with rope and delivered by land or sea. The size and shape have been determined from at least as early as the Neolithic Period. Amphorae were used in vast numbers for the transport and storage of various products, both liquid and dry, but mostly for wine. They are most often ceramic, but examples in metals and other materials have been found. Versions of the amphorae were one of many shapes used in Ancient Greek vase painting.

The amphora complements a vase, the pithos, which makes available capacities between one-half and two and one-half tons. In contrast, the amphora holds under a half-ton, typically less than . The bodies of the two types have similar shapes. Where the pithos may have multiple small loops or lugs for fastening a rope harness, the amphora has two expansive handles joining the shoulder of the body and a long neck. The necks of pithoi are wide for scooping or bucket access. The necks of amphorae are narrow for pouring by a person holding it by the bottom and a handle. Some variants exist. The handles might not be present. The size may require two or three handlers to lift. For the most part, however, an amphora was tableware, or sat close to the table, was intended to be seen, and was finely decorated as such by master painters.

Stoppers of perishable materials, which have rarely survived, were used to seal the contents. Two principal types of amphorae existed: the &quot;neck amphora&quot;, in which the neck and body meet at a sharp angle; and the &quot;one-piece amphora&quot;, in which the neck and body form a continuous curve upwards. Neck amphorae were commonly used in the early history of ancient Greece, but were gradually replaced by the one-piece type from around the 7th century BC onward.

Most were produced with a pointed base to allow upright storage by embedding in soft ground, such as sand. The base facilitated transport by ship, where the amphorae were packed upright or on their sides in as many as five staggered layers. If upright, the bases probably were held by some sort of rack, and ropes passed through their handles to prevent shifting or toppling during rough seas. Heather and reeds might be used as packing around the vases. Racks could be used in kitchens and shops. The base also concentrated deposits from liquids with suspended solid particles, such as olive oil and wines.

Amphorae are of great use to maritime archaeologists, as they often indicate the age of a shipwreck and the geographic origin of the cargo. They are occasionally so well preserved that the original content is still present, providing information on foodstuffs and mercantile systems. Amphorae were too cheap and plentiful to return to their origin-point and so, when empty, they were broken up at their destination. At a breakage site in Rome, Testaccio, close to the Tiber, the fragments, later wetted with calcium hydroxide (calce viva), remained to create a hill now named Monte Testaccio, high and more than 1 kilometre in circumference.

==Etymology==
Amphora is a Greco-Roman word developed in ancient Greek during the Bronze Age. The Romans acquired it during the Hellenization that occurred in the Roman Republic. Cato is the first known literary person to use it. The Romans turned the Greek form into a standard - a declension noun, &quot;amphora&quot;, pl. &quot;amphorae&quot;. The word and the vase were almost certainly introduced to Italy through the Greek settlements there, which traded extensively in Greek pottery.

Even though the Etruscans imported, manufactured, and exported amphorae extensively in their wine industry, and other Greek vase names were Etruscanized, no Etruscan form of the word exists. There was perhaps an as yet unidentified native Etruscan word for the vase that pre-empted the adoption of &quot;amphora&quot;.

The Latin word derived from the Greek &quot;amphoreus&quot; (), a shortened form of &quot;amphiphoreus&quot; (), a compound word combining &quot;amphi-&quot; (&quot;on both sides&quot;, &quot;twain&quot;) and &quot;phoreus&quot; (&quot;carrier&quot;), from &quot;pherein&quot; (&quot;to carry&quot;), referring to the vessel&#x27;s two carrying handles on opposite sides. The amphora appears as , &quot;a-pi-po-re-we&quot;, in the Linear B Bronze Age records of Knossos, , &quot;a-po-re-we&quot;, at Mycenae, and the fragmentary &quot;]-re-we&quot; at Pylos, designated by , Bennett&#x27;s AMPHORA, which has a number of scribal variants. The two spellings are transcriptions of amphiphorēwes (plural) and amphorēwe (dual) in Mycenaean Greek from which it may be seen that the short form prevailed on the mainland. Homer uses the long form for metrical reasons, and Herodotus has the short form. Ventris and Chadwick&#x27;s translation is &quot;carried on both sides.&quot;

==Weights and measures==

Amphorae varied greatly in height. The largest stands as tall as high, while some were less than high - the smallest were called amphoriskoi (literally &quot;little amphorae&quot;). Most were around high.

There was a significant degree of standardisation in some variants; the wine amphora held a standard measure of about 39 litres (41 US qt), giving rise to the amphora quadrantal as a unit of measure in the Roman Empire. In all, approximately 66 distinct types of amphora have been identified.

Further, the term also stands for an ancient Roman unit of measurement for liquids. The volume of a Roman amphora () was about one cubic (foot), equivalent to .

==Production==
Roman amphorae were wheel-thrown terracotta containers. During the production process the body was made first and then left to dry partially. Then coils of clay were added to form the neck, the rim, and the handles. Once the amphora was complete, the maker then treated the interior with resin that would prevent permeation of stored liquids. The reconstruction of these stages of production is based primarily on the study of modern amphora production in some areas of the eastern Mediterranean.

Amphorae often were marked with a variety of stamps, sgraffito, and inscriptions. They provided information on the production, content, and subsequent marketing. A stamp usually was applied to the amphora at a partially dry stage. It indicates the name of the &quot;figlina&quot; (workshop) and/or the name of the owner of the workshop. Painted stamps, &quot;tituli picti&quot;, recorded the weight of the container and the contents, and were applied after the amphora was filled. Today, stamps are used to allow historians to track the flow of trade goods and recreate ancient trade networks.

==Classification==
The first systematic classification of Roman amphorae types was undertaken by the German scholar Heinrich Dressel. Following the exceptional amphora deposit uncovered in Rome in Castro Pretorio at the end of the 1800s, he collected almost 200 inscriptions from amphorae and included them in the &quot;Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum&quot;. In his studies of the amphora deposit he was the first to elaborate a classification of types, the so-called &quot;Dressel table&quot;, which still is used today for many types.

Subsequent studies on Roman amphorae have produced more detailed classifications, which usually are named after the scholar who studied them. For the neo-Phoenician types see the work by Maña published in 1951, and the revised classification by Van der Werff in 1977–1978. The Gallic amphorae have been studied by Laubenheimer in a study published in 1989, whereas the Cretan amphorae have been analyzed by Marangou-Lerat. Beltràn studied the Spanish types in 1970. Adriatic types have been studied by Lamboglia in 1955. For a general analysis of the Western Mediterranean types see Panella, and Peacock and Williams.

==History==
===Prehistoric origins===
Ceramics of shapes and uses falling within the range of amphorae, with or without handles, are of prehistoric heritage across Eurasia, from the Caucasus to China. Amphorae dated to approximately 4800 BC have been found in Banpo, a Neolithic site of the Yangshao culture in China. Amphorae first appeared on the Phoenician coast at approximately 3500 BC.

In the Bronze and Iron Ages amphorae spread around the ancient Mediterranean world, being used by the ancient Greeks and Romans as the principal means for transporting and storing grapes, olive oil, wine, oil, olives, grain, fish, and other agricultural products. They were produced on an industrial scale until approximately the 7th century AD. Wooden and skin containers seem to have supplanted amphorae thereafter.

They influenced Chinese ceramics and other East Asian ceramic cultures, especially as a fancy shape for high-quality decorative ceramics, and continued to be produced there long after they had ceased to be used further west.

===Ancient Greece: fancy shapes for painting===

Besides coarse amphorae used for storage and transport, the vast majority, high-quality painted amphorae were produced in Ancient Greece in significant numbers for a variety of social and ceremonial purposes. Their design differs vastly from the more functional versions; they are typified by wide mouth and a ring base, with a glazed surface and decorated with figures or geometric shapes. They normally have a firm base on which they can stand. Panathenaic amphorae were used as prizes in the Panathenaic Festivals held between the 6th century BC to the 2nd century BC, filled with olive oil from a sacred grove. Surviving examples bear the inscription &quot;I am one of the prizes from Athens&quot;, and usually depict the particular event they were awarded for.

Painted amphorae were also used for funerary purposes, often in special types such as the &quot;loutrophoros&quot;. Especially in earlier periods, outsize vases were used as grave markers, while some amphorae were used as containers for the ashes of the dead. By the Roman period vase-painting had largely died out, and utilitarian amphorae were normally the only type produced.

====Greek amphora types====
Various different types of amphorae were popular at different times:

=====Neck amphora (c. 6th–5th century BC)=====
On a neck amphora, the handles are attached to the neck, which is separated from the belly by an angular carination. There are two main types of neck amphorae:
* the Nolan amphora (late 5th century BC), named for its type site, Nola near Naples, and
* the Tyrrhenian amphora.
There are also some rarer special types of neck amphora, distinguished by specific features, for example:
* the Pointed amphora, with a notably pointed toe, sometimes ending in a knob-like protrusion
* the &quot;Loutrophoros&quot;, used for storing water during ritual ceremonies, such as marriages and funerals.

=====Belly amphora (c. 640–450 BC)=====
In contrast to the neck amphora, a belly amphora does not have a distinguished neck; instead, the belly reaches the mouth in a continuous curve. After the mid-5th century BC, this type was rarely produced. The &quot;pelike&quot; is a special type of belly amphora, with the belly placed lower, so that the widest point of the vessel is near its bottom. The &quot;pelike&quot; was introduced around the end of the 6th century BC.

=====Panathenaic prize amphora=====
Another special type is the Panathenaic prize amphora, with black-figure decoration, produced exclusively as prize vessels for the Panathenaia and retaining the black-figure technique for centuries after the introduction of red-figure vase painting. Some examples bear the inscription &quot;ΤΩΝ ΑΘΗΝΗΘΕΝ ΑΘΛΩΝ&quot; meaning &quot;[I am one] of the prizes from [the goddess] Athena&quot;. They contained the prize of oil from the sacred olive tree of the goddess Athena for the winners of the athletic contests held to honour the goddess, and were evidently kept thereafter, and perhaps used to store wine, before being buried with the prize-winner. They depicted goddess Athena on one side (as seen on the second image on this page) and the athletic event on the other side, e.g. a scene of wrestling or running contest etc.

===Ancient Rome===
By the Roman period utilitarian amphorae were normally the only type produced.

The first type of Roman amphora, Dressel 1, appears in central Italy in the late 2nd century BC. This type had thick walls and a characteristic red fabric. It was very heavy, although also strong. Around the middle of the 1st century BC the so-called Dressel 2-4 starts to become widely used. This type of amphora presented some advantages in being lighter and with thinner walls. It has been calculated that while a ship could accommodate approximately 4500 Dressel 1, it was possible to fit 6000 Dressel 2–4 in the same space. Dressel 2-4 were often produced in the same workshops used for the production of Dressel 1 which quickly ceased to be used.

At the same time in Cuma (southern Italy) the production of the &quot;cadii cumani&quot; type starts (Dressel 21–22). These containers were mainly used for the transportation of fruit and were used until the middle imperial times. At the same time, in central Italy, the so-called Spello amphorae, small containers, were produced for the transportation of wine. On the Adriatic coast the older types were replaced by the Lamboglia 2 type, a wine amphora commonly produced between the end of the 2nd and the 1st century BC. This type develops later into the Dressel 6A which becomes dominant during Augustan times.

In the Gallic provinces the first examples of Roman amphorae were local imitations of pre-existent types such as Dressel 1, Dressel 2–4, Pascual 1, and Haltern 70. The more typical Gallic production begins within the ceramic ateliers in Marseille during late Augustan times. The type Oberaden 74 was produced to such an extent that it influenced the production of some Italic types. Spanish amphorae became particularly popular thanks to a flourishing production phase in late Republican times. The &quot;Hispania Baetica&quot; and &quot;Hispania Tarraconensis&quot; regions (south-western and eastern Spain) were the main production areas between the 2nd and the 1st century BC due to the distribution of land to military veterans and the founding of new colonies. Spanish amphorae were widespread in the Mediterranean area during early imperial times. The most common types were all produced in Baetica and among these there were the Dressel 20, a typical olive oil container, the Dressel 7–13, for garum (fish sauce), and the Haltern 70, for defrutum (fruit sauce). In the Tarraconensis region the Pascual 1 was the most common type, a wine amphora shaped on the Dressel 1, and imitations of Dressel 2–4.

North-African production was based on an ancient tradition which may be traced back to the Phoenician colony of Carthage. Phoenician amphorae had characteristic small handles attached directly onto the upper body. This feature becomes the distinctive mark of late-Republican/early imperial productions, which are then called neo-Phoenician. The types produced in Tripolitania and Northern Tunisia are the Maña C1 and C2, later renamed Van der Werff 1, 2, and 3. In the Aegean area the types from the island of Rhodes were quite popular starting from the 3rd century BC due to local wine production which flourished over a long period. These types developed into the &quot;Camulodunum&quot; 184, an amphora used for the transportation of Rhodian wine all over the empire. Imitations of the Dressel 2-4 were produced on the island of Cos for the transportation of wine from the 4th century BC until middle imperial times. Cretan containers also were popular for the transportation of wine and can be found around the Mediterranean from Augustan times until the 3rd century AD. During the late empire period, north-African types dominated amphora production. The so-called African I and II types were widely used from the 2nd until the late 4th century AD. Other types from the eastern Mediterranean (Gaza), such as the so-called Late Roman 4, became very popular between the 4th and the 7th century AD, while Italic productions ceased.

The largest known wreck of an amphorae cargo ship, carrying 6,000 pots, was discovered off the coast of Kefalonia, an Ionian island off the coast of Greece.

==Modern use==
Some modern winemakers and brewers use amphorae to provide a different palate and taste to their products from those that are available with other aging methods.

<doc id="51814" wikidata="Q40561" url="?curid=51814" title="Sumo">
<text>is a form of competitive full-contact wrestling where a &quot;rikishi&quot; (wrestler) attempts to force his opponent out of a circular ring (&quot;dohyō&quot;) or into touching the ground with any body part other than the soles of his feet (usually by throwing, shoving or pushing him down).

Sumo originated in Japan, the only country where it is practised professionally and where it is considered the national sport. It is considered a &quot;gendai budō&quot;, which refers to modern Japanese martial arts, but the sport has a history spanning many centuries. Many ancient traditions have been preserved in sumo, and even today the sport includes many ritual elements, such as the use of salt purification, from Shinto.

Life as a wrestler is highly regimented, with rules regulated by the Japan Sumo Association. Most sumo wrestlers are required to live in communal sumo training stables, known in Japanese as &quot;heya&quot;, where all aspects of their daily lives—from meals to their manner of dress—are dictated by strict tradition. The lifestyle has a negative effect on their health, with sumo wrestlers having a much lower life expectancy than the average Japanese man.

From 2008 to 2016, a number of high-profile controversies and scandals rocked the sumo world, with an associated effect on its reputation and ticket sales. These have also affected the sport&#x27;s ability to attract recruits. Despite this setback, sumo&#x27;s popularity and general attendance has rebounded due to having multiple &quot;yokozuna&quot; (or grand champions) for the first time in a number of years and other high-profile wrestlers grabbing the public&#x27;s attention.

==Etymology==
The spoken word &quot;sumō&quot; goes back to the verb &quot;sumau/sumafu&quot;, meaning &#x27;compete&#x27; or &#x27;fight&#x27;. The written word goes back to the expression , which was a wrestling competition at the imperial court during the Heian period. The characters from &quot;sumai&quot;, or &quot;sumō&quot; today, mean &#x27;to strike each other&#x27;. There are instances of &quot;sumo&quot; alternatively being written with the kanji &quot;&quot;, as in the . Here, the first character means &#x27;corner&#x27;, but serves as a phonetic element, as one reading of it is &quot;sumi&quot;, while the second character means &#x27;force&#x27;.

&quot;Sumō&quot; is also a general term for wrestling in Japanese. For example, means &#x27;arm wrestling&#x27;, and means &#x27;finger wrestling&#x27;. The professional sumo observed by the Japan Sumo Association is called , or &#x27;grand sumo&#x27;.

==History==
===Antiquity (pre-1185)===

Prehistoric wall paintings indicate that sumo originated from an agricultural ritual dance performed in prayer for a good harvest. The first mention of sumo can be found in a &quot;Kojiki&quot; manuscript dating back to 712, which describes how possession of the Japanese islands was decided in a wrestling match between the &quot;kami&quot; known as Takemikazuchi and Takeminakata.

Takemikazuchi was a god of thunder, swordsmanship, and conquest, created from the blood that was shed when Izanagi slew the fire-demon Kagu-tsuchi. Takeminakata was a god of water, wind, agriculture and hunting, and a distant descendant of the storm-god Susanoo. When Takemikazuchi sought to conquer the land of Izumo, Takeminakata challenged him in hand-to-hand combat. In their melee, Takemikazuchi grappled Takeminakata&#x27;s arm and crushed it &quot;like a reed&quot;, defeating Takeminakata and claiming Izumo.

The , published in 720, dates the first sumo match between mortals to the year 23 BC, when a man named Nomi no Sukune fought against Taima no Kuehaya at the request of Emperor Suinin and eventually killed him, making him the mythological ancestor of sumo. According to the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, Nomi broke a rib of Taima with one kick, and killed him with a kick to the back as well. Until the Japanese Middle Ages, this unregulated form of wrestling was often fought to the death of one of the fighters. In the Kofun period (300–538), &quot;Haniwa&quot; of sumo wrestlers were made. The first historically attested sumo fights were held in 642 at the court of Empress Kōgyoku to entertain a Korean legation. In the centuries that followed, the popularity of sumo within the court increased its ceremonial and religious significance. Regular events at the Emperor&#x27;s court, the , and the establishment of the first set of rules for sumo fall into the cultural heyday of the Heian period.

===Japanese Middle Ages (1185–1603)===
With the collapse of the Emperor&#x27;s central authority, sumo lost its importance in the court; during the Kamakura period, sumo was repurposed from a ceremonial struggle to a form of military combat training among &quot;samurai&quot;. By the Muromachi period, sumo had fully left the seclusion of the court and became a popular event for the masses, and among the &quot;daimyō&quot; it became common to sponsor wrestlers. &quot;Sumotori&quot; who successfully fought for a &quot;daimyō&quot;&#x27;s favor were given generous support and &quot;samurai&quot; status. Oda Nobunaga, a particularly avid fan of the sport, held a tournament of 1,500 wrestlers in February 1578. Because several bouts were to be held simultaneously within Oda Nobunaga&#x27;s castle, circular arenas were delimited to hasten the proceedings and to maintain the safety of the spectators. This event marks the invention of the &quot;dohyō&quot;, which would be developed into its current form up until the 18th century. The winner of Nobunaga&#x27;s tournament was given a bow for being victorious and he began dancing to show the war-lord his gratitude.

===Edo period (1603–1867)===

Because sumo had become a nuisance due to wild fighting on the streets, particularly in Edo, sumo was temporarily banned in the city during the Edo period. In 1684, sumo was permitted to be held for charity events on the property of Shinto shrines, as was common in Kyoto and Osaka. The first sanctioned tournament took place in the Tomioka Hachiman Shrine at this time. An official sumo organization was developed, consisting of professional wrestlers at the disposal of the Edo administration. Many elements date from this period, such as the &quot;dohyō-iri&quot;, the &quot;heya&quot; system, the &quot;gyōji&quot; and the &quot;mawashi&quot;. The 18th century brought forth several notable wrestlers such as Raiden Tameemon, Onogawa Kisaburō and Tanikaze Kajinosuke, the first historical &quot;yokozuna&quot;.

When Matthew Perry was shown sumo wrestling during his 1853 expedition to Japan, he found it distasteful and arranged a military showcase to display the merits of Western organization.

===Since 1868===

The Meiji Restoration of 1868 brought about the end of the feudal system, and with it the wealthy &quot;daimyō&quot; as sponsors. Due to a new fixation on Western culture, sumo had come to be seen as an embarrassing and backward relic, and internal disputes split the central association. The popularity of sumo was restored when Emperor Meiji organized a tournament in 1884; his example would make sumo a national symbol and contribute to nationalist sentiment following military successes against Korea and China. The Japan Sumo Association reunited on 28 December 1925 and increased the number of annual tournaments from two to four, and then to six in 1958. The length of tournaments was extended from ten to fifteen days in 1949.

==Rules and customs==

The elementary principle of sumo is that a match is decided by a fighter first either being forced out of the circular &quot;dohyō&quot; (ring) (not necessarily having to touch the ground outside the ring with any part of the body), or touching the ground inside the ring with any part of the body other than the soles of the feet. The wrestlers try to achieve this by pushing, tossing, striking and often by outwitting the opponent. The Japan Sumo Association currently distinguishes 82 &quot;kimarite&quot; (winning techniques), some of which come from judo. Illegal moves are called &quot;kinjite&quot;, which include strangulation, hair-pulling, bending fingers, gripping the crotch area, kicking, poking eyes, punching and simultaneously striking both the opponent&#x27;s ears. The most common basic forms are grabbing the opponent by the &quot;mawashi&quot; (belt) and then forcing him out, a style called , or pushing the opponent out of the ring without a firm grip, a style called .

The &quot;dohyō&quot;, which is constructed and maintained by the &quot;yobidashi&quot;, consists of a raised pedestal on which a circle in diameter is delimited by a series of rice-straw bales. In the middle of the circle there are two starting lines (&quot;shikiri-sen&quot;), behind which the wrestlers line up for the &quot;tachi-ai&quot;, the synchronized charge that initiates the match. The direction of the match is incumbent on the &quot;gyōji&quot;, a referee who is supported by five &quot;shimpan&quot; (judges). In some situations, a review of the &quot;gyōji&quot;″s decision may be needed. The &quot;shimpan&quot; may convene a conference in the middle of the ring, called a &quot;mono-ii&quot;. This is done if the judges decide that the decision over who won the bout needs to be reviewed; for example, if both wrestlers appear to touch the ground or step out of the ring at the same time. In these cases, sometimes video is reviewed to see what happened. Once a decision is made, the chief judge will announce the decision to the spectators and the wrestlers alike. They may order a bout to be restarted, or leave the decision as given by the &quot;gyōji&quot;. Occasionally the &quot;shimpan&quot; will overrule the &quot;gyōji&quot; and give the bout to the other wrestler. On rare occasions the referee or judges may award the win to the wrestler who touched the ground first. This happens if both wrestlers touch the ground at nearly the same time and it is decided that the wrestler who touched the ground second had no chance of winning, his opponent&#x27;s superior &quot;sumo&quot; having put him in an irrecoverable position. The losing wrestler is referred to as being &quot;shini-tai&quot; (&quot;dead body&quot;) in this case.

The maximum length of a match varies depending on the division. In the top division, the limit is four minutes, although matches usually only last a few seconds. If the match has not yet ended after the allotted time has elapsed, a &quot;mizu-iri&quot; (water break) is taken, after which the wrestlers continue the fight from their previous positions. If a winner is still not found after another four minutes, the fight restarts from the &quot;tachi-ai&quot; after another &quot;mizu-iri&quot;. If this still does not result in a decision, the outcome is considered a &quot;hikiwake&quot; (draw). This is an extremely rare result, with the last such draw being called in September 1974.

A special attraction of sumo is the variety of observed ceremonies and rituals, some of which have been cultivated in connection with the sport and unchanged for centuries. These include the ring-entering ceremonies (&quot;dohyō-iri&quot;) at the beginning of each tournament day, in which the wrestlers appear in the ring in elaborate &quot;kesho-mawashi&quot;, but also such details as the tossing of salt into the ring by the wrestlers, which serves as a symbolic cleansing of the ring, and rinsing the mouth with before a fight, which is similar to the ritual before entering a Shinto shrine. Additionally, before a match begins the two wrestlers perform and repeat a warm up routine called &quot;shikiri&quot;. The top division is given four minutes for &quot;shikiri&quot;, while the second division is given three, after which the timekeeping judge signals to the &quot;gyōji&quot; that time is up.

Traditionally, sumo wrestlers are renowned for their great girth and body mass, which is often a winning factor in sumo. No weight divisions are used in professional sumo; a wrestler can sometimes face an opponent twice his own weight. However, with superior technique, smaller wrestlers can control and defeat much larger opponents. The average weight of top division wrestlers has continued to increase, from in 1969 to over by 1991, and was a record as of January 2019.

==Professional sumo==
Professional sumo is organized by the Japan Sumo Association. The members of the association, called &quot;oyakata&quot;, are all former wrestlers, and are the only people entitled to train new wrestlers. All professional wrestlers must be a member of a training stable (or &quot;heya&quot;) run by one of the &quot;oyakata&quot;, who is the stablemaster for the wrestlers under him. In 2007, 43 training stables hosted 660 wrestlers.

To turn professional, wrestlers must have completed at least nine years of compulsory education and meet minimum height and weight requirements. In 1994, the Japanese Sumo Association required that all sumo wrestlers be a minimum in height. This prompted 16-year-old Takeji Harada of Japan (who had failed six previous eligibility tests) to have four separate cosmetic surgeries over a period of 12 months to add an extra of silicone to his scalp, which created a large, protruding bulge on his head. In response to this, the JSA stated that they would no longer accept aspiring wrestlers who surgically enhanced their height, citing health concerns. In 2019, &quot;The Japan Times&quot; reported that the height requirement was , and the weight requirement was , although they also claimed that a &quot;blind eye&quot; is turned for those &quot;just shy&quot; of the minimums. In 2023 the Sumo Association loosened the height and weight requirements, announcing that prospective recruits not meeting the minimums could still enter sumo by passing a physical fitness exam.

All sumo wrestlers take wrestling names called , which may or may not be related to their real names. Often, wrestlers have little choice in their names, which are given to them by their stablemasters, or by a supporter or family member who encouraged them into the sport. This is particularly true of foreign-born wrestlers. A wrestler may change his wrestling name during his career, with some changing theirs several times.

Professional sumo wrestling has a strict hierarchy based on sporting merit. The wrestlers are ranked according to a system that dates back to the Edo period. They are promoted or demoted according to their performance in six official tournaments held throughout the year, which are called &quot;honbasho&quot;. A carefully prepared &quot;banzuke&quot; listing the full hierarchy is published two weeks prior to each sumo tournament.

In addition to the professional tournaments, exhibition competitions are held at regular intervals every year in Japan, and roughly once every two years, the top-ranked wrestlers visit a foreign country for such exhibitions. None of these displays are taken into account in determining a wrestler&#x27;s future rank. Rank is determined only by performance in grand sumo tournaments.

===Sumo divisions===

The six divisions in sumo, in descending order of prestige, are:

* or . Maximum 42 wrestlers; Further divided into five ranks
* . Fixed at 28 wrestlers
* . Fixed at 120 wrestlers
* . Fixed at 180 wrestlers
* . About 200 wrestlers
* . Around 50 wrestlers

Wrestlers enter sumo in the lowest &quot;jonokuchi&quot; division and, ability permitting, work their way up to the top division. A broad demarcation in the sumo world can be seen between the wrestlers in the top two divisions known as and those in the four lower divisions, known commonly by the more generic term . The ranks receive different levels of compensation, privileges, and status.

The topmost &quot;makuuchi&quot; division receives the most attention from fans and has the most complex hierarchy. The majority of wrestlers are and are ranked from the highest level 1 down to about 16 or 17. In each rank are two wrestlers; the higher rank is designated as &quot;east&quot; and the lower as &quot;west&quot;, so the list goes #1 east, #1 west, #2 east, #2 west, etc. Above the &quot;maegashira&quot; are the three champion or titleholder ranks, called the &quot;san&#x27;yaku&quot;, which are only numbered if the number of wrestlers in each rank exceeds two. These are, in ascending order, , , and . At the pinnacle of the ranking system is the rank of .

&quot;Yokozuna&quot;, or grand champions, are generally expected to compete for and to win the top division tournament title on a regular basis, hence the promotion criteria for &quot;yokozuna&quot; are very strict. In general, an &quot;ōzeki&quot; must win the championship for two consecutive tournaments or an &quot;equivalent performance&quot; to be considered for promotion to &quot;yokozuna&quot;. More than one wrestler can hold the rank of &quot;yokozuna&quot; at the same time.

In antiquity, sumo was solely a Japanese sport. Since the 1900s, however, the number of foreign-born sumo wrestlers has gradually increased. In the beginning of this period, these few foreign wrestlers were listed as Japanese, but particularly since the 1960s, a number of high-profile foreign-born wrestlers became well-known, and in more recent years have even come to dominate in the highest ranks. In the 10 years since January 2009, five of the nine wrestlers promoted to &quot;ōzeki&quot; have been foreign-born, and a Japanese had not been named &quot;yokozuna&quot; from 1998 until the promotion of Kisenosato Yutaka in 2017. This and other issues eventually led the Sumo Association to limit the number of foreigners allowed to one in each stable.

===Women and sumo===

Women are not allowed to compete in professional sumo. They are also not allowed to enter the wrestling ring (&quot;dohyō&quot;), a tradition stemming from Shinto and Buddhist beliefs that women are &quot;impure&quot; because of menstrual blood.

A form of existed in some parts of Japan before professional sumo was established. The 2018 film &quot;The Chrysanthemum and the Guillotine&quot; depicts female sumo wrestlers at the time of civil unrest following the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake.

==Professional sumo tournaments==

Since 1958, six Grand Sumo tournaments or &quot;honbasho&quot; have been held each year: three at the Kokugikan in Tokyo (January, May, and September), and one each in Osaka (March), Nagoya (July), and Fukuoka (November). Until the end of 1984, the Kokugikan was located in Kuramae, Tokyo, but moved in 1985 to the newly built venue at Ryōgoku. Each tournament begins on a Sunday and runs for 15 days, ending also on a Sunday, roughly in the middle of the month. The tournaments are organized in a manner akin to a McMahon system tournament; each wrestler in the top two divisions (&quot;sekitori&quot;) has one match per day, while the lower-ranked wrestlers compete in seven bouts, about one every two days.

Each day is structured so that the highest-ranked contestants compete at the end of the day. Thus, wrestling starts in the morning with the &quot;jonokuchi&quot; wrestlers and ends at around six o&#x27;clock in the evening with bouts involving the &quot;yokozuna&quot;. The wrestler who wins the most matches over the 15 days wins the tournament championship (&quot;yūshō&quot;) for his division. If two wrestlers are tied for the top, they wrestle each other and the winner takes the title. Three-way ties for a championship are rare, at least in the top division. In these cases, the three wrestle each other in pairs with the first to win two in a row take the tournament. More complex systems for championship playoffs involving four or more wrestlers also exist, but these are usually only seen in determining the winner of one of the lower divisions.

The matchups for each day of the tournament are determined by the sumo elders who are members of the judging division of the Japan Sumo Association. They meet every morning at 11 am and announce the following day&#x27;s matchups around 12 pm. An exception are the final day 15 matchups, which are announced much later on day 14. Each wrestler only competes against a selection of opponents from the same division, though small overlaps can occur between two divisions. The first bouts of a tournament tend to be between wrestlers who are within a few ranks of each other. Afterwards, the selection of opponents takes into account a wrestler&#x27;s prior performance. For example, in the lower divisions, wrestlers with the same record in a tournament are generally matched up with each other and the last matchups often involve undefeated wrestlers competing against each other, even if they are from opposite ends of the division. In the top division, in the last few days, wrestlers with exceptional records often have matches against much more highly ranked opponents, including &quot;san&#x27;yaku&quot; wrestlers, especially if they are still in the running for the top division championship. Similarly, more highly ranked wrestlers with very poor records may find themselves fighting wrestlers much further down the division.

An official sumo tournament has only been held outside Japan once: in 1991 at the Royal Albert Hall in London, which Hokutoumi Nobuyoshi won. A return appearance is currently scheduled for October 2025.

For the &quot;yokozuna&quot; and &quot;ōzeki&quot;, the first week and a half of the tournament tends to be taken up with bouts against the top &quot;maegashira&quot;, &quot;komusubi&quot;, and &quot;sekiwake&quot;, with the bouts within these ranks being concentrated into the last five days or so of the tournament (depending on the number of top-ranked wrestlers competing). Traditionally, on the final day, the last three bouts of the tournament are between the top six ranked wrestlers, with the top two competing in the final matchup, unless injuries during the tournament prevent this.

Certain match-ups are prohibited in regular tournament play. Wrestlers who are from the same training stable cannot compete against each other, nor can wrestlers who are brothers, even if they join different stables. The one exception to this rule is that training stable partners and brothers can face each other in a championship-deciding playoff match.

The last day of the tournament is called &quot;senshūraku&quot;, which literally means &quot;the pleasure of a thousand autumns&quot;. This colorful name for the culmination of the tournament echoes the words of the playwright Zeami to represent the excitement of the decisive bouts and the celebration of the victor. The Emperor&#x27;s Cup is presented to the wrestler who wins the top-division &quot;makuuchi&quot; championship. Numerous other (mostly sponsored) prizes are also awarded to him. These prizes are often rather elaborate, ornate gifts, such as giant cups, decorative plates, and statuettes. Others are quite commercial, such as one trophy shaped like a giant Coca-Cola bottle.

Promotion and relegation for the next tournament are determined by a wrestler&#x27;s score over the 15 days. In the top division, the term &quot;kachikoshi&quot; means a score of 8–7 or better, as opposed to &quot;makekoshi&quot;, which indicates a score of 7–8 or worse. A wrestler who achieves &quot;kachikoshi&quot; almost always is promoted further up the ladder, the level of promotion being higher for better scores. See the &quot;makuuchi&quot; article for more details on promotion and relegation.

A top-division wrestler who is not an &quot;ōzeki&quot; or &quot;yokozuna&quot; and who finishes the tournament with &quot;kachikoshi&quot; is also eligible to be considered for one of the three prizes awarded for &quot;technique&quot;, &quot;fighting spirit&quot;, and defeating the most &quot;yokozuna&quot; and &quot;ōzeki&quot; the &quot;outstanding performance&quot; prize. For more information see &quot;sanshō&quot;.

For the list of upper divisions champions since 1909, refer to the list of top division champions and the list of second division champions.

===A professional sumo bout===

At the initial charge, both wrestlers must jump up from the crouch simultaneously after touching the surface of the ring with two fists at the start of the bout. The referee (&quot;gyōji&quot;) can restart the bout if this simultaneous touch does not occur.

Upon completion of the bout, the referee must immediately designate his decision by pointing his &quot;gunbai&quot; or war-fan towards the winning side. The winning technique (&quot;kimarite&quot;) used by the winner would then be announced to the audience. The wrestlers then return to their starting positions and bow to each other before retiring.
The referee&#x27;s decision is not final and may be disputed by the five judges seated around the ring. If this happens, they meet in the center of the ring to hold a &quot;mono-ii&quot; (a talk about things). After reaching a consensus, they can uphold or reverse the referee&#x27;s decision or order a rematch, known as a &quot;torinaoshi&quot;.

A winning wrestler in the top division may receive additional prize money in envelopes from the referee if the matchup has been sponsored. If a &quot;yokozuna &quot;is defeated by a lower-ranked wrestler, it is common and expected for audience members to throw their seat cushions into the ring (and onto the wrestlers), though this practice is technically prohibited.

In contrast to the time in bout preparation, bouts are typically very short, usually less than a minute (most of the time only a few seconds). Extremely rarely, a bout can go on for several minutes.

==Life as a professional sumo wrestler==

A professional sumo wrestler leads a highly regimented way of life. The Sumo Association prescribes the behavior of its wrestlers in some detail. For example, the association prohibits wrestlers from driving cars, although this is partly out of necessity as many wrestlers are too big to fit behind a steering wheel. Breaking the rules can result in fines and/or suspension for both the offending wrestler and his stablemaster.

On entering sumo, they are expected to grow their hair long to form a topknot, or &quot;chonmage&quot;, similar to the &quot;samurai&quot; hairstyles of the Edo period. Furthermore, they are expected to wear the &quot;chonmage&quot; and traditional Japanese dress when in public, allowing them to be identified immediately as wrestlers.

The type and quality of the dress depends on the wrestler&#x27;s rank. &quot;Rikishi&quot; in &quot;jonidan&quot; and below are allowed to wear only a thin cotton robe called a &quot;yukata&quot;, even in winter. Furthermore, when outside, they must wear a form of wooden sandal called &quot;geta&quot;. Wrestlers in the &quot;makushita&quot; and &quot;sandanme&quot; divisions can wear a form of traditional short overcoat over their &quot;yukata&quot; and are allowed to wear straw sandals, called &quot;zōri&quot;. The higher-ranked &quot;sekitori&quot; can wear silk robes of their own choice, and the quality of the garb is significantly improved. They also are expected to wear a more elaborate form of topknot called an &quot;ōichō&quot; (big ginkgo leaf) on formal occasions.

Similar distinctions are made in stable life. The junior wrestlers must get up earliest, around 5 am, for training, whereas the &quot;sekitori&quot; may start around 7 am. When the &quot;sekitori&quot; are training, the junior wrestlers may have chores to do, such as assisting in cooking lunch, cleaning, and preparing baths, holding a &quot;sekitori&quot;″s towel, or wiping the sweat from him. The ranking hierarchy is preserved for the order of precedence in bathing after training, and in eating lunch.

Wrestlers are not normally allowed to eat breakfast and are expected to have a &quot;siesta&quot;-like nap after a large lunch. The most common type of lunch served is the traditional sumo meal of &quot;chankonabe&quot;, which consists of a simmering stew of various meat and vegetables cooked at the table, and usually eaten with rice. This regimen of no breakfast and a large lunch followed by a sleep is intended to help wrestlers put on a lot of weight so as to compete more effectively. Sumo wrestlers also drink large amounts of beer.

In the afternoon, the junior wrestlers again usually have cleaning or other chores, while their &quot;sekitori&quot; counterparts may relax, or deal with work issues related to their fan clubs. Younger wrestlers also attend classes, although their education differs from the typical curriculum of their non-sumo peers. In the evening, &quot;sekitori&quot; may go out with their sponsors, while the junior wrestlers generally stay at home in the stable, unless they are to accompany the stablemaster or a &quot;sekitori&quot; as his &quot;tsukebito&quot; (manservant) when he is out. Becoming a &quot;tsukebito&quot; for a senior member of the stable is a typical duty. A &quot;sekitori&quot; has a number of &quot;tsukebito&quot;, depending on the size of the stable or in some cases depending on the size of the &quot;sekitori&quot;. The junior wrestlers are given the most mundane tasks such as cleaning the stable, running errands, and even washing or massaging the exceptionally large &quot;sekitori&quot; while only the senior &quot;tsukebito&quot; accompany the &quot;sekitori&quot; when he goes out.

The &quot;sekitori&quot; are given their own room in the stable, or may live in their own apartments, as do married wrestlers; the junior wrestlers sleep in communal dormitories. Thus, the world of the sumo wrestler is split broadly between the junior wrestlers, who serve, and the &quot;sekitori&quot;, who are served. Life is especially harsh for recruits, to whom the worst jobs tend to be allocated, and the dropout rate at this stage is high.

The negative health effects of the sumo lifestyle can become apparent later in life. Sumo wrestlers have a life expectancy of 65, which is about 15 years shorter than that of the average Japanese male, as the diet and sport take a toll on the wrestler&#x27;s body. Those having a higher body mass are at greater risk of death. Many develop type 2 diabetes or high blood pressure, and they are prone to heart attacks due to the enormous amount of body mass and fat that they accumulate. The excessive intake of alcohol can lead to liver problems and the stress on their joints due to their excess weight can cause arthritis. The repeated blows to the head sumo wrestlers take can also cause long-term cognitive issues, similar to those seen in boxers. In the 21st century the standards of weight gain became less strict to try and increase the health of the wrestlers.

==Salary and payment==
, the monthly salary figures (in Japanese yen) for the top two divisions were:

*&quot;yokozuna&quot;: ¥3 million, about US$26,500
*&quot;ōzeki&quot;: ¥2.5 million, about US$22,000
*&quot;san&#x27;yaku&quot;: ¥1.8 million, about US$16,000
*&quot;maegashira&quot;: ¥1.4 million, about US$12,500
*&quot;jūryō&quot;: ¥1.1 million, about US$9,500

Wrestlers lower than the second-highest division, who are considered trainees, receive only a fairly small allowance instead of a salary.

In addition to the basic salary, &quot;sekitori&quot; wrestlers also receive additional bonus income, called &quot;mochikyūkin&quot;, six times a year (once every tournament, or &quot;basho&quot;) based on the cumulative performance in their career to date. This bonus increases every time the wrestler scores a &quot;kachikoshi&quot; (with larger &quot;kachikoshi&quot; giving larger raises). Special increases in this bonus are also awarded for winning the top division championship (with an extra large increase for a &quot;perfect&quot; championship victory with no losses or &quot;zenshō-yūshō&quot;), and also for scoring a gold star or &quot;kinboshi&quot; (an upset of a &quot;yokozuna&quot; by a &quot;maegashira&quot;).

&quot;San&#x27;yaku&quot; wrestlers also receive a relatively small additional tournament allowance, depending on their rank, and &quot;yokozuna&quot; receive an additional allowance every second tournament, associated with the making of a new &quot;tsuna&quot; belt worn in their ring entering ceremony.

Also, prize money is given to the winner of each divisional championship, which increases from ¥100,000 for a &quot;jonokuchi&quot; victory up to ¥10 million for winning the top division. In addition to prizes for a championship, wrestlers in the top division giving an exceptional performance in the eyes of a judging panel can also receive one or more of three special prizes (the &quot;sanshō&quot;), which are worth ¥2 million each.

Individual top division matches can also be sponsored by companies, with the resulting prize money called &quot;kenshōkin&quot;. For bouts involving &quot;yokozuna&quot; and &quot;ōzeki&quot;, the number of sponsors can be quite large, whereas for lower-ranked matchups, no bout sponsors may be active at all unless one of the wrestlers is particularly popular, or unless a company has a policy of sponsoring all his matchups. , a single sponsorship cost ¥70,000, with ¥60,000 going to the winner of the bout and ¥10,000 deducted by the Japan Sumo Association for costs and fees. Immediately after the match, the winner receives an envelope from the referee with half of his share of the sponsorship, while the other half is put in a fund for his retirement. No prize money is awarded for bouts decided by a &quot;fusenshō&quot; or forfeit victory.

==Amateur sumo==

===Japan===
Sumo is also practised as an amateur sport in Japan, with participants in college, high school, grade school or company workers on works teams. Open amateur tournaments are also held. The sport at this level is stripped of most of the ceremony. Most new entries into professional sumo are junior high school graduates with little to no previous experience, but the number of wrestlers with a collegiate background in the sport has been increasing over the past few decades. &quot;The International Herald Tribune&quot; reported on this trend in November 1999, when more than a third of the wrestlers in the top two divisions were university graduates. Nippon Sport Science University and Nihon University are the colleges that have produced the most professional sumo wrestlers. The latter produced Hiroshi Wajima, who in 1973 became the first, and remains the only, wrestler with a collegiate background to attain the rank of &quot;yokozuna&quot;.

The most successful amateur wrestlers (usually college champions) are allowed to enter professional sumo at &quot;makushita&quot; (third division) or &quot;sandanme&quot; (fourth division) rather than from the very bottom of the ladder. These ranks are called &quot;makushita tsukedashi&quot; and &quot;sandanme tsukedashi&quot;, and are currently equivalent to &quot;makushita&quot; 10, &quot;makushita&quot; 15, or &quot;sandanme&quot; 100 depending on the level of amateur success achieved. All amateur athletes entering the professional ranks must be under 23 to satisfy the entry, except those who qualify for &quot;makushita tsukedashi&quot; or &quot;sandanme tsukedashi&quot;, who may be up to 25.

===Outside of Japan===
Amateur sumo clubs are gaining in popularity in the United States, with competitions regularly being held in major cities across the country. The US Sumo Open, for example, was held in the Los Angeles Convention Center in 2007 with an audience of 3,000. The sport has long been popular on the West Coast and in Hawaii, where it has played a part in the festivals of the Japanese ethnic communities. Now, however, the sport has grown beyond the sphere of Japanese diaspora and athletes come from a variety of ethnic, cultural, and sporting backgrounds.

Amateur sumo is particularly strong in Europe. Many athletes come to the sport from a background in judo, freestyle wrestling, or other grappling sports such as sambo. Some Eastern European athletes have been successful enough to be scouted into professional sumo in Japan, much like their Japanese amateur counterparts. The most notable of these to date is the Bulgarian Kotoōshū, who is the highest-ranking foreign wrestler who was formerly an amateur sumo athlete.

Brazil is another center of amateur sumo, introduced by Japanese immigrants who arrived during the first half of the twentieth century. The first Brazilian sumo tournament was held in 1914. Sumo took root in immigrant centers in southern Brazil, especially São Paulo, which is now home to the only purpose-built sumo training facility outside Japan. Beginning in the 1990s, Brazilian sumo organizations made an effort to interest Brazilians without Japanese ancestry in the sport, and by the mid-2000s an estimated 70% of participants came from outside the Japanese-Brazilian community. Brazil is also a center for women&#x27;s sumo. A small number of Brazilian wrestlers have made the transition to professional sumo in Japan, including Ryūkō Gō and Kaisei Ichirō.

===International competition===
The International Sumo Federation (IFS) was established in 1992 to encourage the sport&#x27;s development worldwide, including holding international championships like the Sumo World Championships and European Sumo Championships. A key aim of the federation is to have sumo recognized as an Olympic sport. Accordingly, amateur tournaments are divided into weight classes (men: lightweight up to , middleweight up to , heavyweight over , and openweight (unrestricted entry), and include competitions for female wrestlers (lightweight up to , middleweight up to , heavyweight over , and openweight). Sumo was a feature of the World Games, an Olympics-recognized event for non-Olympic sports, from 2001 until 2022; it was removed from future World Games programs due to poor sportsmanship and organization. It has additionally been a feature of the World Combat Games since their inception in 2010.

==Clothing==

Sumo wrestlers wear &quot;mawashi&quot;, a 30-foot-long belt, that they tie in knots in the back. They have an official thickness and strength requirement. During matches, the wrestler will grab onto the other wrestler&#x27;s &quot;mawashi&quot; and use it to help them and make moves during a match. The &quot;mawashi&quot; they wear practicing versus in a tournament is essentially the same except for the material. The different &quot;mawashi&quot; that the wrestlers wear differentiate their rank. Top rated wrestlers wear different colors of silk &quot;mawashi&quot; during tournament, while lower rated wrestlers are limited to just black cotton.

Their hair is put in a topknot, and wax is used to get the hair to stay in shape. Wax is applied to sumo wrestlers&#x27; hair daily by sumo hairdressers (tokoyama). The topknot is a type of samurai hairstyle which was once popular in Japan during the Edo period. The topknot is hard for some foreigners&#x27; hair because their hair is not as coarse and straight as Japanese hair. Once a wrestler joins a stable, he is required to grow out his hair in order to form a topknot.

Outside of tournaments and practices, in daily life, sumo wrestlers are required to wear traditional Japanese clothes. They must wear these traditional clothes all the time in public. What they can wear in public is also determined by rank. Lower rated wrestlers must wear a &quot;yukata&quot; at all times, even in winter, where higher rated wrestlers have more choice in what they wear.

<text>Anne Arundel County (; ), also notated as AA or A.A. County, is located in the U.S. state of Maryland. As of the 2020 United States census, its population was 588,261, an increase of just under 10% since 2010. Its county seat is Annapolis, which is also the capital of the state. The county is named for Anne Arundell (/1616–1649), Lady Baltimore, a member of the ancient family of Arundells in Cornwall, England, and the wife of Cecilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore (1605–1675), founder and first lord proprietor of the colony Province of Maryland. The county is part of the Central Maryland region of the state. Anne Arundel County is included in the Washington–Baltimore–Arlington combined statistical area.

==History==
The county was named for Lady Anne Arundell, (1615/1616–1649), the daughter of Thomas Arundell, 1st Baron Arundell of Wardour, members of the ancient family of Arundells in Cornwall, England. She married Cecilius Calvert, second Lord Baltimore, (1605–1675), and the first lord proprietor of the colony, Province of Maryland, in an arranged marriage contract in 1627 or 1628. Modern spelling adds an &#x27;e&#x27; to her first name of &quot;Ann&quot; and removes the second &#x27;L&#x27; from the family name of &quot;Arundell&quot;, but the old traditional spelling of her name is still used in the title of the local historical society, the Ann Arundell County Historical Society.

Anne Arundel County was originally part of St. Mary&#x27;s County, the province&#x27;s first erected county in the southern portion of the Province of Maryland, which had first been established by arriving settlers in 1634. In 1650, the year after Lady Ann Arundell&#x27;s death, the county separated from St. Mary&#x27;s and &quot;erected&quot; into its own jurisdiction and became the third of the 23 Maryland counties. It was composed of the hundreds of Town Neck, Middle Neck, Broad Neck, South River, West River, and Herring Creek. Between 1654 and 1658, the county was known as &quot;Providence&quot; by many of its early settlers.

On March 25, 1655, after the English Civil War, (1642–1651), in Europe, the Battle of the Severn, the first naval colonial battle ever fought in North America, was fought in Anne Arundel County on the Severn River between Puritan forces supporting the Commonwealth of England and forces loyal to Lord Proprietor Cecilius Calvert. The Commonwealth forces under William Fuller were victorious.

In 1692, the Church of England, also known as the Anglican Church, became the established church of the Province of Maryland through an Act of the General Assembly. Ten counties had been established in the colony, and those counties were divided into 30 parishes, with vestrymen appointed within each. Ann Arrundell County was divided into four parishes: Herring Creek, South River, Middle Neck, and Broad Neck.

Between 1694 and 1695, the provincial capital of Maryland was moved from St. Mary&#x27;s City along the northern shore of the Potomac River across from the southern colonial border with the Province of Virginia in St. Mary&#x27;s County farther north along the western shore of the Chesapeake Bay, midway in the colony to Annapolis in Anne Arundel County. Prior to the move, Annapolis was known as &quot;Providence&quot;.

During the American Revolutionary War, citizens of Anne Arundel County supported the Continental Army by providing troops for three regiments. The 3rd Maryland Regiment, the 4th Maryland Regiment, and the 6th Maryland Regiment were recruited in the county.

During the War of 1812, one of the original six heavy frigates of the recently re-established United States Navy, U.S.S. &quot;Constitution&quot;, sailed from Annapolis prior to its victorious engagement with the H.M.S. &quot;Guerriere&quot; of the British Royal Navy.

On May 22, 1830, the inaugural horse-drawn train of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad travelled the of the newly completed track from Mount Clare Station in southwestern Baltimore to Ellicott Mills, (now Ellicott City), then in the Western or Howard District (now Howard County) of Anne Arundel County. This was the first regular railroad passenger service in the United States. In 1831, land west of the railroad was considered the Howard District of Anne Arundel County. In 1851, The Howard District was broken off to form Howard County, now the 21st county in Maryland (of 23).

The county has a number of properties on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which (29%) is covered by water. Anne Arundel County is located to the south of Baltimore.

Most of the county&#x27;s borders are defined by water. To the east lies the western shore of the Chesapeake Bay, and numerous tidal tributaries of the bay indent the shoreline, the various rivers, creeks, streams, inlets forming prominent peninsulas, also known as &quot;necks&quot; (as further south in Virginia). The largest of these tributaries include (from north to south), the Magothy River, Severn River, South River, and the West River. Further south, the upper Patuxent River forms the border of Anne Arundel with Prince George&#x27;s County to the west. Deep Run forms part of the northwestern border with Howard County, and Lyons Creek forms part of the southern border with Calvert County. The Patapsco River to the north is the border with Baltimore County, but the communities and areas of Brooklyn and Curtis Bay neighborhoods (and adjacent Fairfield, Wagner&#x27;s Point [also known as East Brooklyn], Arundel Cove [off of Curtis Creek], and Hawkins Point), lying south of the Patapsco River were annexed from Anne Arundel County to Baltimore in the third major annexation of January 1919.

Anne Arundel County originally included all of the land between the Patuxent River and the Patapsco River (mainstem and South Branch) upstream to their headwaters on Parr&#x27;s Ridge. The northwestern section of this long tract later became Howard County, with the border between the two running very close to the Atlantic Seaboard fall line. As a result, Anne Arundel County lies almost entirely within the Atlantic Coastal Plain, while Howard County is almost entirely within the Piedmont province.

Elevations in Anne Arundel County range from sea level at the Chesapeake and tidal tributaries to about in western areas near the fall line. The terrain is mostly flat or gently rolling, but more dramatic banks and bluffs can be found where waterways cut through areas of higher elevation.

With the exception of the very limited extent of Piedmont underlain by Precambrian to early Paleozoic metamorphic rock, all of the county is underlain by thick deposits of gravel, sand, silt, and clay dating from the early Cretaceous to Holocene times. Most of these sediments are unconsolidated but include local formations of sandstone, especially in the Pasadena area.

According to the most recent USDA Hardiness zone maps, the lowland areas of the county fall into Zone 8a, with an expected annual minimum temperatures of , while higher elevation and inland areas fall into Zone 7b, with expected annual minima of .

==Politics and government==

Anne Arundel County has had a charter government since 1965. The government consists of a county executive and a seven-member county council. These members are elected in the same years Maryland conducts its gubernatorial and legislative elections, and may serve a maximum of two consecutive terms.

The Democrats have the most registered voters in the county, but the large number of Republican-leaning independents means Republicans win more county-wide elections than in other mostly suburban counties in Maryland, but Democrats are the dominant party in Annapolis city elections. In the 2016 presidential election, Anne Arundel County voted for Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump by 6,016 votes. It was the first time that the county had supported a Democrat for president since 1964. Four years later, Joe Biden won the county by nearly 15%, the largest margin of victory for a Democrat in the county since the landslide election of Lyndon Johnson in the 1964 presidential election.

<doc id="51818" wikidata="Q1050734" url="?curid=51818" title="Informix">
<text>Informix is a product family within IBM&#x27;s Information Management division that is centered on several relational database management system (RDBMS) and multi-model database offerings. The Informix products were originally developed by Informix Corporation, whose Informix Software subsidiary was acquired by IBM in 2001.

In April 2017, IBM delegated active development and support to HCL Technologies for 15 years, with a number of IBM employees working on Informix also moving to HCL. As part of this arrangement IBM will continue to market and sell it as IBM Informix to their customers, with HCLTech able to market and sell it as HCL Informix.

The current version of Informix is 14.10 and forms the basis of several product editions with variation in capacity and functionality. The Informix database has been used in many high transaction rate OLTP applications in the retail, finance, energy and utilities, manufacturing and transportation sectors. More recently the server has been enhanced to improve its support for data warehouse workloads. Through extensions, Informix supports data types that are not a part of the SQL standard.

On July 24, 2020, HCL announced OneDB Database Server V1.0.0.0 as a multi-model (relational, object-relational, and dimensional) DBMS based on Informix. On August 19, 2021 HCL released OneDB 2.0 as a cloud native, multi-cloud, Kubernetes-orchestrated offering.

On December 29, 2021, Actian (formerly Ingres Corporation) became fully owned by HCL America. Actian remained a separate entity, now acting as the &quot;Data, Analytics and Insights&quot; division of HCLSoftware. It is expected that the Informix portfolio will be transferred from HCL to Actian, with HCL Informix and OneDB already available for download at Actian&#x27;s Electronic Software Distribution (ESD) portal.

==Key products==
As of 2023, the current version of both IBM and HCL Informix is 14.10. The major enhancements made over previous releases were adding built-in index compression, integration of JSON collections with support for MongoDB JSON drivers into the server, and an enhancement permitting database objects to be partitioned across multiple servers in a cluster or grid (aka sharding). Queries can optionally return data from the locally connected server instance or from an entire grid with the same SQL.

Informix version 14.10 introduced support for partial indexing where only a subset of the rows in a table are indexed and for multi-valued key indexes which support indexing the elements within multi-valued data types such as LIST, SET, MULTISET, and BSON array fields.

Heterogeneous clusters are fully supported, and there are several deployment options that are available, including some that provide very high levels of data redundancy and fault tolerance. This feature is marketed by IBM as Informix Flexible Grid.

IBM Informix is offered in a number of editions, including free developer editions, editions for small and mid-sized business, and editions supporting the complete feature set and designed to be used in support of the largest enterprise applications. There used to be an advanced data warehouse edition, including the Informix Warehouse Accelerator (IWA), but it was deprecated in favor of the Advanced Enterprise Edition (which give entitlement rights to IWA).

Regarding HCL Informix, there is a single commercial version available, which is compatible with the IBM Informix Advanced Enterprise Edition, also having rights to IWA. There is also a trial version available, with no known limits, except for an expiration date.

HCL Informix 14.10 key highlights include: 
* Functional parity with IBM Informix 14.10 for on-premises deployment 
* Replacement of FlexNet license management with a script-based monitoring solution, consistent with other Actian offerings 
* Expanded O/S support with the addition of Linux on Power Little Endian and Solaris Sparc.

==Positioning==
Informix is generally considered to be optimized for environments with very low or no database administration, including use as an embedded database. It has a long track record of supporting very high transaction rates and providing uptime characteristics needed for mission critical applications such as manufacturing lines and reservation systems. Informix has been widely deployed in the retail sector, where the low administration overhead makes it useful for in-store deployments.

With the ability to deeply embed Informix in gateways and routers, timeseries support, small footprint, and low administration requirements, Informix is also targeted at Internet-of-Things solutions, where many of the data-handling requirements can be handled with gateways that embed Informix and connect sensors and devices to the internet.

==Other products==
In addition to the products based on the version 14.1 engine the Informix family also includes a number of legacy database products which are still supported in market. These include Informix OnLine, Informix Standard Edition (SE), and Informix C-ISAM. These products are simpler and smaller footprint database engines that are also frequently embedded in third party applications. Collectively these products are often referred to as the &quot;Informix Classics&quot;.

The Informix family also includes:
* Informix Client-SDK: a client-side development environment which supports a number of different environments including .net for Windows developers and a variety of protocols for Unix and Linux environments.
* Informix-4GL: a fourth generation language for application programming development.
* Informix Warehouse Accelerator (IWA): an in-memory database based on IBM BLU acceleration technology, which uses a combination of newer technologies including in-memory data, tokenization, deep compression, and columnar database technology to provide extreme high performance on business intelligence and data warehouse style queries. IWA can be installed on the same computer as the Informix database server or another one. It receives copies of data from the database server and organizes it into data marts.
* Informix Enterprise Gateway: it connects the Informix environment with that of any shared-library ODBC Level 2-compliant driver manager and driver on UNIX or Linux. Enterprise Gateway allows Informix database application developers and users to access information on DB2, Oracle, Sybase and other non-Informix databases as easily and transparently as if they were accessing an Informix database server.
Obsolete and non-IBM Informix heritage products can run via emulation on modern hardware. 

==Training and certification==
IBM Training includes a complete set of core Data Servers Training courses that apply to Informix. These courses delve into many essential Informix concepts, from fundamentals to advanced SQL topics.

As part of IBM&#x27;s Academic Initiative, IBM is offering Informix software, documentation and training to higher education institutions worldwide through its new Informix on Campus program. IBM is offering an inclusive package of Informix materials to college faculty called &quot;Informix In a Box&quot;, which offers hands-on labs and PowerPoints to use in lessons, recorded training for teachers, DVDs with class material and VMware virtual appliance images, as well as T-shirts for students.

==Users groups==
Users groups remain active in Belgium, Croatia, France, Germany, the United States, and many other countries. The IIUG (International Informix Users Group) acts as a federation of those user groups and provides numerous services to its members.

<doc id="51822" wikidata="Q686021" url="?curid=51822" title="Allegheny River">
<text>The Allegheny River ( ) is a tributary of the Ohio River that is located in western Pennsylvania and New York in the United States. It runs from its headwaters just below the middle of Pennsylvania&#x27;s northern border, northwesterly into New York, then in a zigzag southwesterly across the border and through Western Pennsylvania to join the Monongahela River at the Forks of the Ohio at Point State Park in Downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

The Allegheny River is, by volume, the main headstream of both the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. Historically, the Allegheny was considered to be the upper Ohio River by both Native Americans and European settlers.

This shallow river has been made navigable upstream from Pittsburgh to East Brady by a series of locks and dams that were constructed during the early 20th century. A 24-mile-long portion of the upper river in Warren and McKean counties of Pennsylvania and Cattaraugus County in New York forms the Allegheny Reservoir, which was created by the erection of the Kinzua Dam in 1965 for flood control.

The name of the river is derived from one of a number of Delaware/Unami phrases that are homophones of the English name, with varying translations.

==Etymology==

The name &quot;Allegheny&quot; probably comes from Lenape &quot;welhik hane&quot; or &quot;oolikhanna,&quot; which means &#x27;best flowing river of the hills&#x27; or &#x27;beautiful stream&#x27;. There is a Lenape legend of a tribe called &quot;Talligewi&quot; who used to live along the river. Frederick Webb Hodge cited Henry Schoolcraft to connect the &quot;Talligewi&quot; to the Cherokee.

The following account of the origin of the name &quot;Allegheny&quot; was given in 1780 by Moravian missionary David Zeisberger: &quot;All this land and region, stretching as far as the creeks and waters that flow into the Alleghene the Delawares called Alligewinenk, which means &#x27;a land into which they came from distant parts&#x27;. The river itself, however, is called Alligewi Sipo. The whites have made Alleghene out of this, the Six Nations calling the river the Ohio.&quot;

The Delaware Tribe of Indians gives the Lenape name as &quot;Alikehane&quot;, &quot;river where footprints can be seen.&quot;

Native Americans, including the Lenape and Iroquois, considered the Allegheny and Ohio rivers as the same, as is suggested by a New York State road sign on Interstate 86 that refers to the Allegheny River also as &quot;Ohiːyo&quot;&#x27;. The Geographic Names Information System lists &quot;O-hee-yo&quot; and &quot;O-hi-o&quot; as variant names. The river is called Ohi:&#x27;i:o` (river beautiful) in the Seneca language. In New York, areas around the river are often named with the alternate spelling &quot;Allegany&quot; in reference to the river; for example, the Village of Allegany and Allegany State Park. Port Allegany, located along the river in Pennsylvania near the border with New York, also follows this pattern.

==Course==

The Allegheny River rises in north central Pennsylvania, on Cobb Hill in Allegany Township in north central Potter County, south of the New York–Pennsylvania border and a few miles northwest of the eastern triple divide. The stream flows south and passes under Pennsylvania Route 49 11 miles northeast of Coudersport where a historical marker that declares the start of the river is located. Cobb Hill is about a mile north. The stream flows southwest paralleling Route 49 to Coudersport.

The route continues west to Port Allegany, where thereafter the river joins with a number of small streams and widens considerably before turning north and crossing into western New York. Looping westward across southern Cattaraugus County for approximately , past Portville, Olean, Allegany and Salamanca, the river flows through Seneca Indian Nation lands close to the northern boundary of Allegany State Park before re-entering northwestern Pennsylvania within the Allegheny Reservoir just east of the Warren-McKean county line, approx. northeast of Warren.

It flows in a broad zigzag course generally southwest across Western Pennsylvania; first flowing southwest past Warren, Tidioute, Tionesta, Oil City, and Franklin, forming much of the northwestern boundary of Allegheny National Forest. South of Franklin it turns southeast across Clarion County in a meandering course, then turns again southwest across Armstrong County, flowing past Kittanning, Ford City, Clinton, and Freeport.
The river enters both Allegheny and Westmoreland counties, the Pittsburgh suburbs, and the City of Pittsburgh from the northeast. It passes the North Side, downtown Pittsburgh, and Point State Park. The Allegheny joins with the Monongahela River at the &quot;Point&quot; in downtown Pittsburgh to form the Ohio River.

==Hydrography==

The river is approximately long, running through the U.S. states of New York and Pennsylvania. It drains a rural dissected plateau of in the northern Allegheny Plateau, providing the northeasternmost drainage in the watershed of the Mississippi River. Its tributaries reach to within of Lake Erie in southwestern New York.

Water from the Allegheny River eventually flows into the Gulf of Mexico via the Ohio and Mississippi rivers.

The Allegheny Valley has been one of the most productive areas of fossil fuel extraction in United States history, with its extensive deposits of coal, petroleum, and natural gas.

===Tributaries===

In its upper reaches, the Allegheny River is joined from the south by Potato Creek downstream of Coryville, Pennsylvania and from the north by Olean Creek at Olean, New York. Tunungwant &quot;Tuna&quot; Creek joins the river from the south in Carrollton, New York (flowing north from Bradford, Pennsylvania); the Great Valley Creek and Little Valley Creek join the river from the north at Salamanca, New York before becoming the Allegheny Reservoir.

After re-entering Pennsylvania, the river is joined from the east by Kinzua Creek upstream of Warren; from the north by Conewango Creek at Warren; from the west by Brokenstraw Creek; from the east by East Hickory Creek at East Hickory; from the east by Tionesta Creek at Tionesta; from the north by Oil Creek at Oil City; from the west by French Creek at Franklin; from the east by the Clarion River, a principal tributary, at Parker; from the east by Crooked Creek southeast of Kittanning; and from the east by the Kiskiminetas River, another principal tributary, at Schenley.

Buffalo Creek enters at Freeport, Chartiers Run enters at Lower Burrell, Bull Creek enters at Tarentum, Pucketa Creek enters near New Kensington, Riddle Run enters at Springdale, and Girtys Run enters at Millvale. And finally, the confluence of the Monongahela River and Allegheny form the Ohio River at downtown Pittsburgh. Many additional streams enter or join with the Allegheny River along its course.

===Locks, dams and bridges===

Several locks were built in the early 20th century to make the Allegheny River navigable for 72 miles upstream from Pittsburgh to East Brady.

The Allegheny River has eight locks and fixed-crest dams numbered two through nine: Allegheny River Lock and Dam No. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 which form corresponding reservoirs.

The river is also impounded by the Kinzua Dam in northwestern Pennsylvania, resulting in the Allegheny Reservoir also known as Kinzua Lake and Lake Perfidy among the Seneca. The Seneca Pumped Storage Generating Station is associated with Kinzua Dam.

Numerous bridges and tunnels span the river throughout its course. The Allegheny River Tunnel, utilized by Pittsburgh Light Rail, went into service in 2012.

==History==

In the latter half of the 17th century, control of the river valley passed back-and-forth between Algonquian-speaking Shawnee and the Iroquois. By the time of the arrival of French colonialists in the early 18th century, the Shawnee were once again in control and formed an alliance with France against attempts by colonists from British North America to settler across the Allegheny Mountains. The conflict over the expansion of Anglo-American settlement into the Allegheny Valley and the surrounding Ohio Country was a primary cause of the French and Indian War in the 1750s. During the war, the village of Kittanning – the principal Shawnee settlement on the river – was completely destroyed during the Kittanning Expedition, which saw 300 provincial troops from the Province of Pennsylvania brutally attack the settlement.

After gaining control of the area in the 1763 Treaty of Paris, the British kept the area closed to Anglo-American colonists, in part to repair and maintain relations with the Native Americans. After the American Revolutionary War, the entire river valley became part of the new United States, and U.S. settlers forcibly displaced the region&#x27;s indigenous population. During the 19th century, the river became a principal means of navigation in the upper Ohio valley, especially for the transport of coal. Although the building of the railroads lessened the importance of the river somewhat, the lower river (navigable as far as East Brady, Pennsylvania through locks) has continued to serve as a route of commercial transportation until the present day. In 1859, the first U.S. petroleum was drilled north of the river at Titusville. One of the underlying premises of the Genesee Valley Canal was its connection to the river, opening a trade route from Rochester, New York to the west. The advent of the railroads obviated any interest Pennsylvania might have had in participating to improve navigation on the river. The canal was closed in 1877 and the right-of-way sold to the Genesee Valley Canal Railroad.
In 1965, the completion of the federally sponsored Kinzua Dam for flood-control in northwestern Pennsylvania east of Warren created the long Allegheny Reservoir, known as Lake Perfidy among the Seneca, part of which is included in the Allegheny National Recreation Area. The dam flooded parts of lands deeded &quot;forever&quot; to the Seneca Nation of Indians by the 1794 Treaty of Canandaigua, and lands given to Cornplanter and his descendants. The event was described in the Johnny Cash song &quot;As Long as the Grass Shall Grow&quot; from the 1964 album &quot;Bitter Tears: Ballads of the American Indian&quot;, which focused on the history of and problems facing Native Americans in the United States.

The construction of the dam and the filling of the Allegheny Reservoir also necessitated the elimination of the small village of Corydon, which was located at the confluence of Willow Creek with the Allegheny River; and the small village of Kinzua, which was located at the confluence of Kinzua Creek with the Allegheny River. All residents of both villages were forced to move.
Many prominent individuals opposed the construction of the dam at that time because of the damage it would do to Seneca lands, including Pennsylvania Congressman John P. Saylor of Johnstown, and Howard Zahniser, executive director of The Wilderness Society and native of Tionesta—a small settlement located along the Allegheny River several miles downstream from Warren. During the campaign for the 1960 United States presidential election, John F. Kennedy assured the Seneca Nation that he would oppose the dam if elected. However, he failed to follow through on his pledge upon becoming president.

In 1992, of the Allegheny River was designated Wild and Scenic. This designation comprises three segments of the river located in Warren, Forest, and Venango counties.

==In popular culture==
Depression-era folk singer Buster Red recorded &quot;Allegheny River&quot;, wherein the river is a destructive force throughout life, but not necessarily a malignant one.

Folksinger Pete Seeger&#x27;s song &quot;Where the Old Allegheny and Monongahela Flow&quot;, depicts a character living in a city pining for a return to the Allegheny River.

Old Crow Medicine Show released a song entitled &quot;Allegheny Lullaby&quot; that detailed life along the Allegheny in late 20th century Rust Belt towns, the river serving as a metaphor for escape.

In 2008, Katie Spotz became the first person to swim the entire of the Allegheny River; she was accompanied by safety kayaker, James Hendershott. The team began at the river&#x27;s source in Warren, Pennsylvania on July 22 and finished at the &quot;Point&quot; in Downtown Pittsburgh on August 21.

In 2017 the documentary &quot;Lake of Betrayal&quot; was released detailing the struggle of the Seneca Nation over the Kinzua Dam project on the Allegheny in the 1960s.

<doc id="51825" wikidata="Q37151" url="?curid=51825" title="Sun Tzu">
<text>Sun Tzu was a Chinese military general, strategist, philosopher, and writer who lived during the Eastern Zhou period (771–256 BC). Sun Tzu is traditionally credited as the author of &quot;The Art of War&quot;, an influential work of military strategy that has affected both Western and East Asian philosophy and military thought. Sun Tzu is revered in Chinese and East Asian culture as a legendary historical and military figure. His birth name was Sun Wu and he was known outside of his family by his courtesy name Changqing. The name &quot;Sun Tzu&quot;by which he is more popularly knownis an honorific which means &quot;Master Sun&quot;.

Sun Tzu mastered the military science of ancient China and created the military doctrine of asymmetrical warfare. According to it, an attack on the enemy should begin only after the enemy has no opportunity to either defend or counterattack. It was used in the wars in the era of the Warring States in ancient China (about 475–221 BC). Those combat combinations had specific names, descriptions and classifications.

Sun Tzu&#x27;s historicity is uncertain. The Han dynasty historian Sima Qian and other traditional Chinese historians placed him as a minister to King Helü of Wu and dated his lifetime to 544–496 BC. Many modern scholars accepting his historicity place the extant text of &quot;The Art of War&quot; in the later Warring States period of 475 to 221 BC, based on its style of composition and its descriptions of warfare. Traditional accounts state that the general&#x27;s descendant Sun Bin wrote a treatise on military tactics, also titled &quot;The Art of War&quot;. Since both Sun Wu and Sun Bin were referred to as &quot;Sun Tzu&quot; in classical Chinese texts, some historians believed them identical, prior to the rediscovery of Sun Bin&#x27;s treatise in 1972.

Sun Tzu&#x27;s work has been praised and employed throughout the arc of East Asian military history since its composition, and eventually earned global attention. During the twentieth century, &quot;The Art of War&quot; grew in popularity and saw practical use in the Western world as well. 

==Life==

The oldest available sources disagree as to where Sun Tzu was born. The &quot;Spring and Autumn Annals&quot; and Sima Qian&#x27;s later &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot; (&quot;Shiji&quot;) state that Sun Tzu was born in Qi. Both sources also agree that Sun Tzu was born in the late Spring and Autumn period and that he was active as a general and strategist, serving King Helü of Wu in the sixth century BC, beginning around 512 BC. Sun Tzu&#x27;s victories then inspired him to write &quot;The Art of War&quot;. &quot;The Art of War&quot; was one of the most widely read military treatises in the subsequent Warring States period, a time of constant war among seven ancient Chinese states—Zhao, Qi, Qin, Chu, Han, Wei, and Yan—who fought to control the vast expanse of fertile territory in Eastern China.

One of the better-known stories about Sun Tzu, taken from Sima Qian, illustrates Sun Tzu&#x27;s temperament as follows: Before hiring Sun Tzu, the King of Wu tested Sun Tzu&#x27;s skills by commanding him to train a harem of 180 concubines into soldiers. Sun Tzu divided them into two companies, appointing the two concubines most favored by the king as the company commanders. When Sun Tzu first ordered the concubines to face right, they giggled. In response, Sun Tzu said that the general, in this case himself, was responsible for ensuring that soldiers understood the commands given to them. Then, he reiterated the command, and again the concubines giggled. Sun Tzu then ordered the execution of the king&#x27;s two favored concubines, to the king&#x27;s protests. He explained that if the general&#x27;s soldiers understood their commands but did not obey, it was the fault of the officers. Sun Tzu also said that, once a general was appointed, it was his duty to carry out his mission, even if the king protested. After both concubines were killed, new officers were chosen to replace them. Afterward, both companies, now well aware of the costs of further frivolity, performed their maneuvers flawlessly.

Sima Qian claimed that Sun Tzu later proved on the battlefield that his theories were effective (for example, at the Battle of Boju), that he had a successful military career, and that he wrote &quot;The Art of War&quot; based on his tested expertise. However, the &quot;Zuozhuan&quot;, a historical text written centuries earlier than the &quot;Shiji&quot;, provides a much more detailed account of the Battle of Boju, but does not mention Sun Tzu at all.

===Historicity===
Around the 12th century AD, some Chinese scholars began to doubt the historical existence of Sun Tzu, primarily on the grounds that he is not mentioned in the historical classic &quot;Zuo Zhuan&quot;, which mentions most of the notable figures from the Spring and Autumn period. The name &quot;Sun Wu&quot; () does not appear in any text prior to the &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;, and may have been a made-up descriptive cognomen meaning &quot;the fugitive warrior&quot;the surname &quot;Sun&quot; can be glossed as the related term &quot;fugitive&quot; (&quot;xùn&quot; ), while &quot;Wu&quot; is the ancient Chinese virtue of &quot;martial, valiant&quot; (&quot;wǔ&quot; ), which corresponds to Sun Tzu&#x27;s role as the hero&#x27;s &quot;doppelgänger&quot; in the story of Wu Zixu. The only historical battle attributed to Sun Tzu, the Battle of Boju, has no record of him fighting in that battle. 

Skeptics cite possible historical inaccuracies and anachronisms in the text, and that the book was actually a compilation from different authors and military strategists. Attribution of the authorship of &quot;The Art of War&quot; varies among scholars and has included people and movements including Sun; Chu scholar Wu Zixu; an anonymous author; a school of theorists in Qi or Wu; Sun Bin; and others. Sun Bin appears to have been an actual person who was a genuine authority on military matters, and may have been the inspiration for the creation of the historical figure &quot;Sun Tzu&quot; through a form of euhemerism. The name Sun Wu does appear in later sources such as the &quot;Shiji&quot; and the &quot;Wu Yue Chunqiu&quot;, but were written centuries after Sun Tzu&#x27;s era.

The use of the strips in other works, however, such as &quot;The Methods of the Sima&quot; is considered proof of Sun Tzu&#x27;s historical priority. According to Ralph Sawyer, it is very likely Sun Tzu did exist and not only served as a general, but also wrote the core of the book that bears his name. It is argued that there is a disparity between the large-scale wars and sophisticated techniques detailed in the text and the more primitive small-scale battles that many believe predominated in China during the 6th century BC. Against this, Sawyer argues that the teachings of Sun Wu were probably taught to succeeding generations in his family or a small school of disciples, which eventually included Sun Bin. These descendants or students may have revised or expanded upon certain points in the original text.

Skeptics who identify issues with the traditionalist view point to possible anachronisms in &quot;The Art of War&quot; including terms, technology (such as anachronistic crossbows), philosophical ideas, events, and military techniques that should not have been available to Sun Wu. Additionally, there are no records of professional generals during the Spring and Autumn period; these are only extant from the Warring States period, so there is doubt as to Sun Tzu&#x27;s rank and generalship. This caused much confusion as to when &quot;The Art of War&quot; was actually written. The first traditional view is that it was written in 512 BC by the historical Sun Wu, active in the last years of the Spring and Autumn period (–481 BC). A second view, held by scholars such as Samuel Griffith, places &quot;The Art of War&quot; during the middle to late Warring States period (–221 BC). Finally, a third school claims that the slips were published in the last half of the 5th century BC; this is based on how its adherents interpret the bamboo slips discovered at Yinque Shan in 1972.

==&quot;The Art of War&quot;==

&quot;The Art of War&quot; is traditionally ascribed to Sun Tzu. It presents a philosophy of war for managing conflicts and winning battles. It is accepted as a masterpiece on strategy and has been frequently cited and referred to by generals and theorists since it was first published, translated, and distributed internationally.

There are numerous theories concerning when the text was completed and concerning the identity of the author or authors, but archeological recoveries show &quot;The Art of War&quot; had taken roughly its current form by at least the early Han period. Because it is impossible to prove definitively when the &quot;Art of War&quot; was completed before this date, the differing theories concerning the work&#x27;s author or authors and date of completion are unlikely to be completely resolved. Some modern scholars believe that it contains not only the thoughts of its original author but also commentary and clarifications from later military theorists, such as Li Quan and Du Mu.

Of the military texts written before the unification of China and Shi Huangdi&#x27;s subsequent book burning in the second century BC, six major works have survived. During the much later Song dynasty, these six works were combined with a Tang text into a collection called the &quot;Seven Military Classics&quot;. As a central part of that compilation, &quot;The Art of War&quot; formed the foundations of orthodox military theory in early modern China. Illustrating this point, the book was required reading to pass the tests for imperial appointment to military positions.

Sun Tzu&#x27;s &quot;The Art of War&quot; uses language that may be unusual in a Western text on warfare and strategy. For example, the eleventh chapter states that a leader must be &quot;serene and inscrutable&quot; and capable of comprehending &quot;unfathomable plans&quot;. The text contains many similar remarks that have long confused Western readers lacking an awareness of the East Asian context. The meanings of such statements are clearer when interpreted in the context of Taoist thought and practice.

The text outlines theories of battle, but also advocates diplomacy and the cultivation of relationships with other nations as essential to the health of a state.

On 10 April 1972, the Yinqueshan Han Tombs were accidentally unearthed by construction workers in Shandong.
Scholars uncovered a collection of ancient texts written on unusually well-preserved bamboo slips. Among them were &quot;The Art of War&quot; and Sun Bin&#x27;s &quot;Military Methods&quot;. Although Han dynasty bibliographies noted the latter publication as extant and written by a descendant of Sun, it had previously been lost. The rediscovery of Sun Bin&#x27;s work is regarded as extremely important by scholars, both because of Sun Bin&#x27;s relationship to Sun Tzu and because of the work&#x27;s addition to the body of military thought in Chinese late antiquity.
The discovery as a whole significantly expanded the body of surviving Warring States military theory. Sun Bin&#x27;s treatise is the only known military text surviving from the Warring States period discovered in the twentieth century and bears the closest similarity to &quot;The Art of War&quot; of all surviving texts.

==Legacy==

Sun Tzu&#x27;s &quot;Art of War&quot; has influenced many notable figures. The Han dynasty historian Sima Qian recounted that China&#x27;s first historical emperor, Qin&#x27;s Shi Huangdi, considered the book invaluable in ending the time of the Warring States. In the twentieth century, Mao Zedong partially credited his 1949 victory over Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang to &quot;The Art of War&quot;. The work strongly influenced writings about warfare in Mao&#x27;s Little Red Book, which further influenced communist insurgencies around the world.

&quot;The Art of War&quot; was introduced into Nara Japan in and the book quickly became popular among Japanese military generals. Through its later influence on the Sengoku period &quot;Great Unifiers&quot; of Japan, Oda Nobunaga, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and Tokugawa Ieyasu, it significantly affected the unification of Japan in the early modern era. After the Meiji Restoration, it remained popular among the Imperial Japanese armed forces. Admiral Tōgō Heihachirō, who led Japan&#x27;s forces to victory in the Russo-Japanese War, was an avid reader of Sun Tzu.

Ho Chi Minh translated the work for his Vietnamese officers to study. His general Võ Nguyên Giáp was likewise an avid student and practitioner of Sun Tzu&#x27;s ideas.

Taoist rhetoric is a component incorporated in the &quot;Art of War&quot;. According to Steven C. Combs in &quot;Sun-zi and the &quot;Art of War&quot;: The Rhetoric of Parsimony&quot;, warfare is &quot;used as a metaphor for rhetoric, and that both are philosophically based arts.&quot; Combs writes: &quot;Warfare is analogous to persuasion, as a battle for hearts and minds.&quot; Combs compares Taoist and Aristotelian rhetoric, notably for the differences in persuasion. Daoist rhetoric in &quot;The Art of War&quot; warfare strategies is described as &quot;peaceful and passive, favoring silence over speech&quot;. This form of communication is parsimonious. Parsimonious behavior, which is highly emphasized in &quot;The Art of War&quot; as avoiding confrontation and being spiritual in nature, shapes basic principles in Taoism.

In &quot;Sun Tzu and the Art of Modern Warfare&quot;, Mark McNeilly writes that a modern interpretation of Sun and his importance throughout Chinese history is critical in understanding China&#x27;s push to become a superpower in the twenty-first century. Modern Chinese scholars explicitly rely on historical strategic lessons and &quot;The Art of War&quot; in developing their theories, seeing a direct relationship between their modern struggles and those of China in Sun Tzu&#x27;s time. There is a great perceived value in Sun Tzu&#x27;s teachings and other traditional Chinese writers, which are used regularly in developing the strategies of the Chinese state and its leaders.

Some admirers of Sun Tzu&#x27;s work claim that it has relevance in competitive endeavors across the modern world beyond military strategy and warfare, including espionage, culture, governance, business, and sports.

Sun Tzu has even been mentioned in pop culture. For example, in the 1987 film &quot;Wall Street&quot;, the protagonist Gordon Gekko frequently cites passages from &quot;The Art of War&quot; as guiding principles for his aggressive trading techniques.

<text>Pope St. Dionysius (Greek: Διονύσιος) was the bishop of Rome from 22 July 259 AD to his death on 26 December 268. His task was to reorganise the Catholic Church, after the persecutions of Emperor Valerian I, and the edict of toleration by his successor Gallienus. He also helped rebuild the churches of Cappadocia, devastated by the marauding Goths.

==Pontificate==
Dionysius may have been born in Magna Græcia, but this has not been verified. He was elected pope in 259, after the martyrdom of Sixtus II in 258. The Holy See had been vacant for nearly a year because it was difficult to elect a new pope during the violent persecution which Christians faced. When the oppression had begun to subside, Dionysius was raised to the office of Bishop of Rome. Emperor Valerian I, who had led the tyranny, was captured and killed by the King of Persia in 260. The new emperor, Gallienus, issued an edict of toleration, restoring the churches, cemeteries and other properties it had held, ushering in the nearly 40-year &quot;Little Peace of the Church&quot;. To the new pope fell the task of reshaping the Catholic Church, which had fallen into great disorder. 

Teaching regarding the relation of God to the Logos had arisen from Bishop Dionysius in Alexandria. The pope in Rome called for explanations; a satisfactory response duly arrived back, notwithstanding expostulation about the propriety of all this from some of the Alexandrian Christians.

To rebuild, and to ransom those held captive, Pope Dionysius sent large sums of money to the churches of Cappadocia, devastated by marauding Goths. Following Emperor Gallienus&#x27; edict of toleration, he brought order to the church and helped secure a peace that lasted until 303, some 35 years after his death on 26 December 268.

According to St. Athanasius, Pope St. Dionysius retroactively condemned Arianism far before the First Ecumenical Council of Nicaea on behalf of the entire Church saying, &quot;For Dionysius, Bishop of Rome, having written also against those who said that the Son of God was a creature and a created thing, it is manifest that not now for the first time but from of old the heresy of the Arian adversaries of Christ has been &quot;anathematised by all&quot;.&quot;

In art, Dionysius is portrayed in papal vestments, along with a book.

<doc id="51829" wikidata="Q185161" url="?curid=51829" title="Rodinia">
<text>Rodinia (from the Russian , &quot;rodina&quot;, meaning &quot;motherland, birthplace&quot;) was a Mesoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic supercontinent that assembled 1.26–0.90 billion years ago (Ga) and broke up 750–633 million years ago (Ma). were probably the first to recognise a Precambrian supercontinent, which they named &quot;Pangaea I.&quot; It was renamed &quot;Rodinia&quot; by , who also were the first to produce a plate reconstruction and propose a temporal framework for the supercontinent.

Rodinia formed at c. 1.23 Ga by accretion and collision of fragments produced by breakup of an older supercontinent, Columbia, assembled by global-scale 2.0–1.8 Ga collisional events. Rodinia broke up in the Neoproterozoic, with its continental fragments reassembled to form Pannotia 633–573 Ma. In contrast with Pannotia, little is known about Rodinia&#x27;s configuration and geodynamic history. Paleomagnetic evidence provides some clues to the paleolatitude of individual pieces of the Earth&#x27;s crust, but not to their longitude, which geologists have pieced together by comparing similar geologic features, often now widely dispersed.

The extreme cooling of the global climate around 717–635 Ma (the so-called Snowball Earth of the Cryogenian period) and the rapid evolution of primitive life during the subsequent Ediacaran and Cambrian periods are thought to have been triggered by the breaking up of Rodinia or to a slowing down of tectonic processes.

==Geodynamics==
===Paleogeographic reconstructions===

The idea that a supercontinent existed in the early Neoproterozoic arose in the 1970s, when geologists determined that orogens of this age exist on virtually all cratons. Examples are the Grenville orogeny in North America and the Dalslandian orogeny in Europe. Since then, many alternative reconstructions have been proposed for the configuration of the cratons in this supercontinent. Most of these reconstructions are based on the correlation of the orogens on different cratons. Though the configuration of the core cratons in Rodinia is now reasonably well known, recent reconstructions still differ in many details. Geologists try to decrease the uncertainties by collecting geological and paleomagnetical data.
Most reconstructions show Rodinia&#x27;s core formed by the North American Craton (the later paleocontinent of Laurentia), surrounded in the southeast with the East European Craton (the later paleocontinent of Baltica), the Amazonian Craton and the West African Craton; in the south with the Río de la Plata and São Francisco cratons; in the southwest with the Congo and Kalahari cratons; and in the northeast with Australia, India and eastern Antarctica. The positions of Siberia and North and South China north of the North American craton differ strongly depending on the reconstruction:
*SWEAT-Configuration (Southwest US-East Antarctica craton): Antarctica is southwest of Laurentia, and Australia is north of Antarctica.
*AUSWUS-Configuration (Australia-western US): Australia is west of Laurentia.
*AUSMEX-Configuration (Australia-Mexico): Australia is at the location of current day Mexico relative to Laurentia.
*The &quot;Missing-link&quot; model by which has South China between Australia and the west coast of Laurentia. A revised &quot;Missing-link&quot; model is proposed in which Tarim Block serves as an extended or alternative missing-link between Australia and Laurentia.
*Siberia attached to the western US (via the Belt Supergroup), as in .

Little is known about the paleogeography before the formation of Rodinia. Paleomagnetic and geologic data are only definite enough to form reconstructions from the breakup of Rodinia onwards. Rodinia is considered to have formed between 1.3 and 1.23 Ga and broke up again before 750 Ma. Rodinia was surrounded by the superocean Mirovia.

According to J.D.A. Piper, Rodinia is one of two models for the configuration and history of the continental crust in the latter part of Precambrian times. The other is Paleopangea, Piper&#x27;s own concept. Piper proposes an alternative hypothesis for this era and the previous ones. This idea rejects that Rodinia ever existed as a transient supercontinent subject to progressive break-up in the late Proterozoic and instead that this time and earlier times were dominated by a single, persistent &quot;Paleopangaea&quot; supercontinent. As evidence, he suggests an observation that the palaeomagnetic poles from the continental crust assigned to this time conform to a single path between 825 and 633 Ma and latterly to a near-static position between 750 and 633 Ma. This latter solution predicts that break-up was confined to the Ediacaran period and produced the dramatic environmental changes that characterised the transition between the Precambrian and Phanerozoic. However, this theory has been widely criticized, as incorrect applications of paleomagnetic data have been pointed out.

===Breakup===
In 2009 UNESCO&#x27;s International Geoscience Programme project 440, named &quot;Rodinia Assembly and Breakup,&quot; concluded that Rodinia broke up in four stages between 825 and 550 Ma:
* The breakup was initiated by a superplume around 825–800 Ma whose influence—such as crustal arching, intense bimodal magmatism, and accumulation of thick rift-type sedimentary successions—has been recorded in South Australia, South China, Tarim, Kalahari, India, and the Arabian-Nubian Craton.
* Rifting progressed in the same cratons 800–750 Ma and spread into Laurentia and perhaps Siberia. India (including Madagascar) and the Congo–São Francisco Craton were either detached from Rodinia during this period or simply never were part of the supercontinent.
* As the central part of Rodinia reached the Equator around 750–700 Ma, a new pulse of magmatism and rifting continued the disassembly in western Kalahari, West Australia, South China, Tarim, and most margins of Laurentia.
* 650–550 Ma several events coincided: the opening of the Iapetus Ocean; the closure of the Braziliano, Adamastor, and Mozambique oceans; and the Pan-African orogeny. The result was the formation of Gondwana.

The Rodinia hypothesis assumes that rifting did not start everywhere simultaneously. Extensive lava flows and volcanic eruptions of Neoproterozoic age are found on most continents, evidence for large scale rifting about 750 Ma. As early as 850 to 800 Ma, a rift developed between the continental masses of present-day Australia, East Antarctica, India and the Congo and Kalahari cratons on one side and later Laurentia, Baltica, Amazonia and the West African and Rio de la Plata cratons on the other. This rift developed into the Adamastor Ocean during the Ediacaran.

Around 550 Ma, near the boundary between the Ediacaran and Cambrian, the first group of cratons fused again with Amazonia, West Africa and the Rio de la Plata cratons during the Pan-African orogeny, which caused the development of Gondwana.

In a separate rifting event about 610 Ma, the Iapetus Ocean formed. The eastern part of this ocean formed between Baltica and Laurentia, the western part between Amazonia and Laurentia. Because the timeframe of this separation and the partially contemporaneous Pan-African orogeny are difficult to correlate, it might be that all continental mass was again joined in one supercontinent between roughly 600 and 550 Ma. This hypothetical supercontinent is called Pannotia.

==Influence on paleoclimate and life==
Unlike later supercontinents, Rodinia was entirely barren. It existed before complex life colonized on dry land. Based on sedimentary rock analysis, Rodinia&#x27;s formation happened when the ozone layer was not as extensive as it is now. Ultraviolet light discouraged organisms from inhabiting its interior. Nevertheless, its existence significantly influenced the marine life of its time.

In the Cryogenian, Earth experienced large glaciations, and temperatures were at least as cool as today. Substantial parts of Rodinia may have been covered by glaciers or the southern polar ice cap. Low temperatures may have been exaggerated during the early stages of continental rifting. Geothermal heating peaks in crust about to be rifted, and since warmer rocks are less dense, the crustal rocks rise up relative to their surroundings. This rising creates areas of higher altitude where the air is cooler and ice is less likely to melt with changes in season, and it may explain the evidence of abundant glaciation in the Ediacaran.

The rifting of the continents created new oceans and seafloor spreading, which produces warmer, less dense oceanic crust. Lower-density, hot oceanic crust will not lie as deep as older, cool oceanic lithosphere. In periods with relatively large areas of new lithosphere, the ocean floors come up, causing the sea level to rise. The result was a greater number of shallower seas.

The increased evaporation from the oceans&#x27; larger water area may have increased rainfall, which in turn increased the weathering of exposed rock. By inputting data on the ratio of stable isotopes 18O:16O into computer models, it has been shown that in conjunction with quick weathering of volcanic rock, the increased rainfall may have reduced greenhouse gas levels to below the threshold required to trigger the period of extreme glaciation known as Snowball Earth. Increased volcanic activity also introduced into the marine environment biologically active nutrients, which may have played an important role in the earliest animals&#x27; development.

<text>Valerian ( ; ; – 260 or 264) was Roman emperor from 253 to spring 260 AD. Valerian is known as the first Roman emperor to have been taken captive in battle, captured by the Persian emperor Shapur I after the Battle of Edessa, causing shock and instability throughout the Roman Empire. The unprecedented event and his unknown fate generated a variety of different reactions and &quot;new narratives about the Roman Empire in diverse contexts&quot;.

==Biography==
===Origins and rise to power===
Unlike many of the would-be emperors and rebels who vied for imperial power during the Crisis of the Third Century, Valerian was of a noble and traditional senatorial family. Details of his early life are sparse, except for his marriage to Egnatia Mariniana, with whom he had two sons: Publius Licinius Egnatius Gallienus (his co-emperor and later successor) and Licinius Valerianus.

Valerian was consul for the first time either before AD 238 as a &quot;Suffectus&quot; or in 238 as an &quot;Ordinarius&quot;. In 238 he was &quot;princeps senatus&quot;, and Gordian I negotiated through him for senatorial acknowledgement for his claim as emperor. In 251 AD, when Decius revived the censorship with legislative and executive powers so extensive that it practically embraced the civil authority of the emperor, Valerian was chosen censor by the Senate, though he declined to accept the post. During the reign of Decius he was left in charge of affairs in Rome when that prince left for his ill-fated last campaign in Illyricum. Under Trebonianus Gallus Valerian was appointed &quot;dux&quot; of an army probably drawn from the garrisons of the German provinces which seems to have been ultimately intended for use in a war against the Persians.

However, when Trebonianus Gallus had to deal with the rebellion of Aemilianus in 253 AD, he turned to Valerian for assistance in crushing the attempted usurpation. Valerian headed south but was too late: Gallus was killed by his own troops, who joined Aemilianus before Valerian arrived. The Raetian soldiers then proclaimed Valerian emperor and continued their march towards Rome. Upon his arrival in September, Aemilianus&#x27;s legions defected, killed him and proclaimed Valerian emperor. In Rome, the Senate quickly acknowledged Valerian.
===Rule and fall===

Valerian&#x27;s first act as emperor was to appoint his son Gallienus &quot;augustus&quot;, thus making him co-emperor. Early in his reign, affairs in Europe went from bad to worse, and the whole West fell into disorder. In the East, Antioch had fallen into the hands of a Sassanid vassal and Armenia was occupied by Shapur I (Sapor). Valerian and Gallienus split the problems of the empire between them, with the son taking the West, and the father heading East to face the Persian threat.

In 254, 255, and 257, Valerian again became &quot;Consul Ordinarius.&quot; By 257, he had recovered Antioch and returned the province of Syria to Roman control. The following year, the Goths ravaged Asia Minor. In 259, Valerian moved on to Edessa, but an outbreak of plague killed a critical number of legionaries, weakening the Roman position, and the town was besieged by the Persians. In 260, probably in June, Valerian was decisively defeated in the Battle of Edessa and held prisoner for the remainder of his life. Valerian&#x27;s capture was a tremendous defeat for the Romans.

===Persecution of Christians===

While fighting the Persians, Valerian sent two letters to the Senate ordering that firm steps be taken against Christians. The first, sent in 257, commanded Christian clergy to perform sacrifices to the Roman gods or face banishment. The second, the following year, ordered the execution of Christian leaders. It also required Christian senators and equites to perform acts of worship to the Roman gods or lose their titles and property, and directed that they be executed if they continued to refuse. It also decreed that Roman matrons who would not apostatize should lose their property and be banished, and that civil servants and members of the Imperial household who would not worship the Roman gods should be reduced to slavery and sent to work on the Imperial estates. This indicates that Christians were well-established at that time, some in very high positions.

The execution of Saint Prudent at Narbonne is taken to have occurred in 257.
Prominent Christians executed in 258 included Pope Sixtus II (6 August), Saint Romanus Ostiarius (9 August) and Saint Lawrence (10 August).
Others executed in 258 included the saints Denis in Paris, Pontius in Cimiez, Cyprian and others in Carthage and Eugenia in Rome. 
In 259 Saint Patroclus was executed at Troyes and Saint Fructuosus at Tarragona.
When Valerian&#x27;s son Gallienus became emperor in 260, the decree was rescinded.
===Death in captivity===
Eutropius, writing between 364 and 378 AD, stated that Valerian &quot;was overthrown by Shapur king of Persia, and being soon after made prisoner, grew old in ignominious slavery among the Parthians.&quot; An early Christian source, Lactantius (thought to be virulently anti-Persian, thanks to the occasional persecution of Christians by some Sasanian monarchs) maintained that, for some time prior to his death, Valerian was subjected to the greatest insults by his captors, like being used as a human footstool by Shapur when mounting his horse. According to this version of events, after a long period of such treatment, Valerian offered Shapur a huge ransom for his release.

In reply (according to one version), Shapur was said to have forced Valerian to swallow molten gold (the other version of his death is almost the same but it says that Valerian was killed by being flayed alive) and then had Valerian skinned and his skin stuffed with straw and preserved as a trophy in the main Persian temple. It was further alleged that it was only after a later Persian defeat against Rome that his skin was given a cremation and burial. The captivity and death of Valerian has been frequently debated by historians without any definitive conclusion.

According to the modern scholar Touraj Daryaee, contrary to the account of Lactantius, Shapur I sent Valerian and some of his army to the city of Bishapur or Gundishapur where they lived in relatively good conditions. Shapur used the remaining soldiers in engineering and development plans. &quot;Band-e Kaisar&quot; (Caesar&#x27;s dam) is one of the remnants of Roman engineering located near the ancient city of Susa. In all the stone carvings on Naghshe-Rostam, in Iran, Valerian is represented holding hands with Shapur I, a sign of submission. According to the early Persian Muslim scholar Abu Hanifa Dinawari, Shapur settled the prisoners of war in Gundishapur and released Valerian, as promised, after the construction of Band-e Kaisar.

It has been alleged that the account of Lactantius is coloured by his desire to establish that persecutors of the Christians died fitting deaths; the story was repeated then and later by authors in the Roman Near East fiercely hostile to Persia.

The joint rule of Valerian and Gallienus was threatened several times by usurpers. Nevertheless, Gallienus held the throne until his own assassination in 268 AD.

==Family==
* Gallienus
* Licinius Valerianus was another son of Valerian I. Consul in 265, he was probably killed by usurpers, some time between the capture of his father in 260 and the assassination of his brother Gallienus in 268.





== In literature and the arts ==
Valerian appears in Joseph of Anchieta’s 1587 play &quot;Auto de São Lourenço&quot; as one of the main characters. In Act III, Valerian is killed for being responsible for the persecution and killing of Saint Lawrence, in the year 258 AD. Valerian also appears in Anthony Hecht&#x27;s poem &quot;Behold the Lilies of the Field&quot; in the collection &quot;The Hard Hours&quot;, and in Harry Sidebottom&#x27;s historical fiction series of novels &quot;Warrior of Rome&quot;.

<text>The Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare, usually called the Geneva Protocol, is a treaty prohibiting the use of chemical and biological weapons in international armed conflicts. It was signed at Geneva on 17 June 1925 and entered into force on 8 February 1928. It was registered in &quot;League of Nations Treaty Series&quot; on 7 September 1929. The Geneva Protocol is a protocol to the Convention for the Supervision of the International Trade in Arms and Ammunition and in Implements of War signed on the same date, and followed the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907.

It prohibits the use of &quot;asphyxiating, poisonous or other gases, and of all analogous liquids, materials or devices&quot; and &quot;bacteriological methods of warfare&quot;. This is now understood to be a general prohibition on chemical weapons and biological weapons between state parties, but has nothing to say about production, storage or transfer. Later treaties did cover these aspects – the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) and the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).

A number of countries submitted reservations when becoming parties to the Geneva Protocol, declaring that they only regarded the non-use obligations as applying to other parties and that these obligations would cease to apply if the prohibited weapons were used against them.

==Negotiation history==

In the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907, the use of dangerous chemical agents was outlawed. In spite of this, the First World War saw large-scale chemical warfare. France used tear gas in 1914, but the first large-scale successful deployment of chemical weapons was by the German Empire in Ypres, Belgium in 1915, when chlorine gas was released as part of a German attack at the Battle of Gravenstafel. Following this, a chemical arms race began, with the United Kingdom, Russia, Austria-Hungary, the United States, and Italy joining France and Germany in the use of chemical weapons.

This resulted in the development of a range of horrific chemicals affecting lungs, skin, or eyes. Some were intended to be lethal on the battlefield, like hydrogen cyanide, and efficient methods of deploying agents were invented. At least 124,000 tons were produced during the war. In 1918, about one grenade out of three was filled with dangerous chemical agents. Around 500k-1.3 million casualties of the conflict were attributed to the use of gas, and the psychological effect on troops may have had a much greater effect. A few thousand civilians also became casualties as collateral damage or due to production accidents.

The Treaty of Versailles included some provisions that banned Germany from either manufacturing or importing chemical weapons. Similar treaties banned the First Austrian Republic, the Kingdom of Bulgaria, and the Kingdom of Hungary from chemical weapons, all belonging to the losing side, the Central powers. Russian bolsheviks and Britain continued the use of chemical weapons in the Russian Civil War and possibly in the Middle East in 1920.

Three years after World War I, the Allies wanted to reaffirm the Treaty of Versailles, and in 1922 the United States introduced the Treaty relating to the Use of Submarines and Noxious Gases in Warfare at the Washington Naval Conference. Four of the war victors, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Kingdom of Italy and the Empire of Japan, gave consent for ratification, but it failed to enter into force as the French Third Republic objected to the submarine provisions of the treaty.

At the 1925 Geneva Conference for the Supervision of the International Traffic in Arms the French suggested a protocol for non-use of poisonous gases. The Second Polish Republic suggested the addition of bacteriological weapons. It was signed on 17 June.

==Historical assessment==

Eric Croddy, assessing the Protocol in 2005, took the view that the historic record showed it had been largely ineffectual. Specifically it does not prohibit:

* use against not-ratifying parties
* retaliation using such weapons, so effectively making it a no-first-use agreement
* use within a state&#x27;s own borders in a civil conflict
* research and development of such weapons, or stockpiling them
In light of these shortcomings, Jack Beard notes that &quot;the Protocol (...) resulted in a legal framework that allowed states to conduct [biological weapons] research, develop new biological weapons, and ultimately engage in [biological weapons] arms races&quot;.

As such, the use of chemical weapons inside the nation&#x27;s own territory against its citizens or subjects employed by Spain in the Rif War until 1927, Japan against Seediq indigenous rebels in Taiwan (then part of the Japanese colonial empire) in 1930 during the Musha Incident, Iraq against ethnic Kurdish civilians in the 1988 attack on Halabja during the Iran–Iraq War, and Syria or Syrian opposition forces during the Syrian civil war, nor use on Black Lives Matter protestors in the United States did not breach the Geneva Protocol.

Despite the U.S. having been a proponent of the protocol, the U.S. military and American Chemical Society lobbied against it, causing the U.S. Senate not to ratify the protocol until 1975, the same year when the United States ratified the Biological Weapons Convention.

==Violations==
Several state parties have deployed chemical weapons for combat in spite of the treaty. Italy used mustard gas against the Ethiopian Empire in the Second Italo-Ethiopian War. In World War II, Germany employed chemical weapons in combat on several occasions along the Black Sea, notably in Sevastopol, where they used toxic smoke to force Soviet resistance fighters out of caverns below the city. They also used asphyxiating gas in the catacombs of Odesa in November 1941, following their capture of the city, and in late May 1942 during the Battle of the Kerch Peninsula in eastern Crimea, perpetrated by the Wehrmacht&#x27;s Chemical Forces and organized by a special detail of SS troops with the help of a field engineer battalion. After the battle in mid-May 1942, the Germans gassed and killed almost 3,000 of the besieged and non-evacuated Red Army soldiers and Soviet civilians hiding in a series of caves and tunnels in the nearby Adzhimushkay quarry.

During the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq War, Iraq is known to have employed a variety of chemical weapons against Iranian forces. Some 100,000 Iranian troops were casualties of Iraqi chemical weapons during the war.

==Subsequent interpretation of the protocol==
In 1966, United Nations General Assembly resolution 2162B called for, without any dissent, all states to strictly observe the protocol. In 1969, United Nations General Assembly resolution 2603 (XXIV) declared that the prohibition on use of chemical and biological weapons in international armed conflicts, as embodied in the protocol (though restated in a more general form), were generally recognized rules of international law. Following this, there was discussion of whether the main elements of the protocol now form part of customary international law, and now this is widely accepted to be the case.

There have been differing interpretations over whether the protocol covers the use of harassing agents, such as adamsite and tear gas, and defoliants and herbicides, such as Agent Orange, in warfare. The 1977 Environmental Modification Convention prohibits the military use of environmental modification techniques having widespread, long-lasting or severe effects. Many states do not regard this as a complete ban on the use of herbicides in warfare, but it does require case-by-case consideration. The 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention effectively banned riot control agents from being used as a method of warfare, though still permitting it for riot control.

In recent times, the protocol had been interpreted to cover non-international armed conflicts as well international ones. In 1995, an appellate chamber in the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia stated that &quot;there had undisputedly emerged a general consensus in the international community on the principle that the use of chemical weapons is also prohibited in internal armed conflicts.&quot; In 2005, the International Committee of the Red Cross concluded that customary international law includes a ban on the use of chemical weapons in internal as well as international conflicts.

However, such views drew general criticism from legal authors. They noted that much of the chemical arms control agreements stems from the context of &quot;international&quot; conflicts. Furthermore, the application of customary international law to banning chemical warfare in non-international conflicts fails to meet two requirements: state practice and &quot;opinio juris&quot;. Jillian Blake &amp; Aqsa Mahmud cited the periodic use of chemical weapons in non-international conflicts since the end of WWI (as stated above) as well as the lack of existing international humanitarian law (such as the Geneva Conventions) and national legislation and manuals prohibiting using them in such conflicts. Anne Lorenzat stated the 2005 ICRC study was rooted in &quot;&#x27;political and operational issues rather than legal ones&quot;.

==State parties==
To become party to the Protocol, states must deposit an instrument with the government of France (the depositary power). Thirty-eight states originally signed the Protocol. France was the first signatory to ratify the Protocol on 10 May 1926. El Salvador, the final signatory to ratify the Protocol, did so on 26 February 2008. As of April 2021, 146 states have ratified, acceded to, or succeeded to the Protocol, most recently Colombia on 24 November 2015.

===Reservations===
A number of countries submitted reservations when becoming parties to the Geneva Protocol, declaring that they only regarded the non-use obligations as applying with respect to other parties to the Protocol and/or that these obligations would cease to apply with respect to any state, or its allies, which used the prohibited weapons. Several Arab states also declared that their ratification did not constitute recognition of, or diplomatic relations with, Israel, or that the provision of the Protocol were not binding with respect to Israel.

Generally, reservations not only modify treaty provisions for the reserving party, but also symmetrically modify the provisions for previously ratifying parties in dealing with the reserving party. Subsequently, numerous states have withdrawn their reservations, including the former Czechoslovakia in 1990 prior to its dissolution, or the Russian reservation on biological weapons that &quot;preserved the right to retaliate in kind if attacked&quot; with them, which was dissolved by President Yeltsin.

According to the Vienna Convention on Succession of States in respect of Treaties, states which succeed to a treaty after gaining independence from a state party &quot;shall be considered as maintaining any reservation to that treaty which was applicable at the date of the succession of States in respect of the territory to which the succession of States relates unless, when making the notification of succession, it expresses a contrary intention or formulates a reservation which relates to the same subject matter as that reservation.&quot; While some states have explicitly either retained or renounced their reservations inherited on succession, states which have not clarified their position on their inherited reservations are listed as &quot;implicit&quot; reservations.

<text>The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), officially the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction, is an arms control treaty administered by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), an intergovernmental organization based in The Hague, Netherlands. The treaty entered into force on 29 April 1997. It prohibits the use of chemical weapons, and the large-scale development, production, stockpiling, or transfer of chemical weapons or their precursors, except for very limited purposes (research, medical, pharmaceutical or protective). The main obligation of member states under the convention is to effect this prohibition, as well as the destruction of all current chemical weapons. All destruction activities must take place under OPCW verification.

 193 states have become parties to the CWC and accept its obligations. Israel has signed but not ratified the agreement, while three other UN member states (Egypt, North Korea and South Sudan) have neither signed nor acceded to the treaty. Most recently, the State of Palestine deposited its instrument of accession to the CWC on 17 May 2018. In September 2013, Syria acceded to the convention as part of an agreement for the destruction of Syria&#x27;s chemical weapons.

As of February 2021, 98.39% of the world&#x27;s declared chemical weapons stockpiles had been destroyed. The convention has provisions for systematic evaluation of chemical production facilities, as well as for investigations of allegations of use and production of chemical weapons based on the intelligence of other state parties.

Some chemicals which have been used extensively in warfare but have numerous large-scale industrial uses (such as phosgene) are highly regulated; however, certain notable exceptions exist. Chlorine gas is highly toxic, but being a pure element and widely used for peaceful purposes, is not officially listed as a chemical weapon. Certain state powers (e.g. the former Assad regime of Syria) continue to regularly manufacture and implement such chemicals in combat munitions. Although these chemicals are not specifically listed as controlled by the CWC, the use of any toxic chemical as a weapon (when used to produce fatalities solely or mainly through its toxic action) is in and of itself forbidden by the treaty. Other chemicals, such as white phosphorus, are highly toxic but are legal under the CWC when they are used by military forces for reasons other than their toxicity.

==History==
The CWC augments the Geneva Protocol of 1925, which bans the use of chemical and biological weapons in international armed conflicts, but not their development or possession. The CWC also includes extensive verification measures such as on-site inspections, in stark contrast to the 1975 Biological Weapons Convention (BWC), which lacks a verification regime.

After several changes of name and composition, the ENDC evolved into the Conference on Disarmament (CD) in 1984. On 3 September 1992 the CD submitted to the U.N. General Assembly its annual report, which contained the text of the Chemical Weapons Convention. The General Assembly approved the convention on 30 November 1992, and the U.N. Secretary-General then opened the convention for signature in Paris on 13 January 1993. The CWC remained open for signature until its entry into force on 29 April 1997, 180 days after the deposit at the UN by Hungary of the 65th instrument of ratification.

==Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW)==
The convention is administered by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), which acts as the legal platform for specification of the CWC provisions. The Conference of the States Parties is mandated to change the CWC and pass regulations on the implementation of CWC requirements. The Technical Secretariat of the organization conducts inspections to ensure compliance of member states. These inspections target destruction facilities (where constant monitoring takes place during destruction), chemical weapons production facilities which have been dismantled or converted for civil use, as well as inspections of the chemical industry. The Secretariat may furthermore conduct &quot;investigations of alleged use&quot; of chemical weapons and give assistance after use of chemical weapons.

The 2013 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to the organization because it had, with the Chemical Weapons Convention, &quot;defined the use of chemical weapons as a taboo under international law&quot; according to Thorbjørn Jagland, Chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee.

==Key points of the Convention==
* Prohibition of production and use of chemical weapons
* Destruction (or monitored conversion to other functions) of chemical weapons production facilities
* Destruction of all chemical weapons (including chemical weapons abandoned outside the state parties territory)
* Assistance between State Parties and the OPCW in the case of use of chemical weapons
* An OPCW inspection regime for the production of chemicals which might be converted to chemical weapons
* International cooperation in the peaceful use of chemistry in relevant areas

===Controlled substances===

The convention distinguishes three classes of controlled substance, chemicals that can either be used as weapons themselves or used in the manufacture of weapons. The classification is based on the quantities of the substance produced commercially for legitimate purposes. Each class is split into Part A, which are chemicals that can be used directly as weapons, and Part B, which are chemicals useful in the manufacture of chemical weapons. Separate from the precursors, the convention defines toxic chemicals as &quot;[a]ny chemical which through its chemical action on life processes can cause death, temporary incapacitation or permanent harm to humans or animals. This includes all such chemicals, regardless of their origin or of their method of production, and regardless of whether they are produced in facilities, in munitions or elsewhere.&quot;

*Schedule 1 chemicals have few, or no uses outside chemical weapons. These may be produced or used for research, medical, pharmaceutical or chemical weapon defence testing purposes but production at sites producing more than 100 grams per year must be declared to the OPCW. A country is limited to possessing a maximum of 1 tonne of these materials. Examples are sulfur mustard and nerve agents, and substances which are solely used as precursor chemicals in their manufacture. A few of these chemicals have very small scale non-military applications, for example, milligram quantities of nitrogen mustard are used to treat certain cancers.
*Schedule 2 chemicals have legitimate small-scale applications. Manufacture must be declared and there are restrictions on export to countries that are not CWC signatories. An example is thiodiglycol which can be used in the manufacture of mustard agents, but is also used as a solvent in inks.
*Schedule 3 chemicals have large-scale uses apart from chemical weapons. Plants which manufacture more than 30 tonnes per year must be declared and can be inspected, and there are restrictions on export to countries which are not CWC signatories. Examples of these substances are phosgene (the most lethal chemical weapon employed in WWI), which has been used as a chemical weapon but which is also a precursor in the manufacture of many legitimate organic compounds (e.g. pharmaceutical agents and many common pesticides), and triethanolamine, used in the manufacture of nitrogen mustard but also commonly used in toiletries and detergents.
Many of the chemicals named in the schedules are simply examples from a wider class, defined with Markush like language. For example, all chemicals in the class &quot;O-Alkyl (&lt;=C10, incl. cycloalkyl) alkyl (Me, Et, n-Pr or i-Pr)- phosphonofluoridates chemicals&quot; are controlled, despite only a few named examples being given, such as Soman.

This can make it more challenging for companies to identify if chemicals they handle are subject to the CWC, especially Schedule 2 and 3 chemicals (such as Alkylphosphorus chemicals).  For example, Amgard 1045 is a flame retardant, but falls within Schedule 2B as part of Alkylphosphorus chemical class. This approach is also used in controlled drug legislation in many countries and are often termed &quot;class wide controls&quot; or &quot;generic statements&quot;.

Due to the added complexity these statements bring in identifying regulated chemicals, many companies choose to carry out these assessments computationally, examining the chemicals structure using in silico tools which compare them to the legislation statements, either with in house systems maintained a company or by the use commercial compliance software solutions.

A treaty party may declare a &quot;single small-scale facility&quot; that produces up to 1 tonne of Schedule 1 chemicals for research, medical, pharmaceutical or protective purposes each year, and also another facility may produce 10 kg per year for protective testing purposes. An unlimited number of other facilities may produce Schedule 1 chemicals, subject to a total 10 kg annual limit, for research, medical or pharmaceutical purposes, but any facility producing more than 100 grams must be declared.

The treaty also deals with carbon compounds called in the treaty &quot;discrete organic chemicals&quot;, the majority of which exhibit moderate-high direct toxicity or can be readily converted into compounds with toxicity sufficient for practical use as a chemical weapon. These are any carbon compounds apart from long chain polymers, oxides, sulfides and metal carbonates, such as organophosphates. The OPCW must be informed of, and can inspect, any plant producing (or expecting to produce) more than 200 tonnes per year, or 30 tonnes if the chemical contains phosphorus, sulfur or fluorine, unless the plant solely produces explosives or hydrocarbons.

===Category definitions===
Chemical weapons are divided into three categories:
* Category 1 - based on Schedule 1 substances
* Category 2 - based on non-Schedule 1 substances
* Category 3 - devices and equipment designed to use chemical weapons, without the substances themselves

==Member states==

Before the CWC came into force in 1997, 165 states signed the convention, allowing them to ratify the agreement after obtaining domestic approval. Following the treaty&#x27;s entry into force, it was closed for signature and the only method for non-signatory states to become a party was through accession. As of March 2021, 193 states, representing over 98 percent of the world&#x27;s population, are party to the CWC. Of the four United Nations member states that are not parties to the treaty, Israel has signed but not ratified the treaty, while Egypt, North Korea, and South Sudan have neither signed nor acceded to the convention. Taiwan, though not a member state, has stated on 27 August 2002 that it fully complies with the treaty.

===Key organizations of member states===
Member states are represented at the OPCW by their Permanent Representative. This function is generally combined with the function of Ambassador. For the preparation of OPCW inspections and preparation of declarations, member states have to constitute a National Authority.

==World stockpile of chemical weapons==

A total of 72,304 metric tonnes of chemical agent, and 97 production facilities have been declared to OPCW.

===Treaty deadlines===
The treaty set up several steps with deadlines toward complete destruction of chemical weapons, with a procedure for requesting deadline extensions. No country reached total elimination by the original treaty date although several have finished under allowed extensions.

===Progress of destruction===
At the end of 2019, 70,545 of 72,304 (97.51%) metric tonnes of chemical agent have been verifiably destroyed. More than 57% (4.97 million) of chemical munitions and containers have been destroyed.

Seven state parties have completed the destruction of their declared stockpiles: Albania, India, Iraq, Libya, Syria, the United States, and an unspecified state party (believed to be South Korea). Russia also completed the destruction of its declared stockpile. According to the US Arms Control Association, the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in 2018 and the poisoning of Alexei Navalny in 2020 indicated that Russia maintained an illicit chemical weapons program. 

Japan and China in October 2010 began the destruction of World War II era chemical weapons abandoned by Japan in China by means of mobile destruction units and reported destruction of 35,203 chemical weapons (75% of the Nanjing stockpile).

====Iraqi stockpile====
The U.N. Security Council ordered the dismantling of Iraq&#x27;s chemical weapon stockpile in 1991. By 1998, UNSCOM inspectors had accounted for the destruction of 88,000 filled and unfilled chemical munitions, over 690 metric tons of weaponized and bulk chemical agents, approximately 4,000 tonnes of precursor chemicals, and 980 pieces of key production equipment. The UNSCOM inspectors left in 1998.

In 2009, before Iraq joined the CWC, the OPCW reported that the United States military had destroyed almost 5,000 old chemical weapons in open-air detonations since 2004. These weapons, produced before the 1991 Gulf War, contained sarin and mustard agents but were so badly corroded that they could not have been used as originally intended.

When Iraq joined the CWC in 2009, it declared &quot;two bunkers with filled and unfilled chemical weapons munitions, some precursors, as well as five former chemical weapons production facilities&quot; according to OPCW Director General Rogelio Pfirter. The bunker entrances were sealed with 1.5 meters of reinforced concrete in 1994 under UNSCOM supervision. As of 2012, the plan to destroy the chemical weapons was still being developed, in the face of significant difficulties. In 2014, ISIS took control of the site.

On 13 March 2018, the Director-General of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), Ambassador Ahmet Üzümcü, congratulated the Government of Iraq on the completion of the destruction of the country&#x27;s chemical weapons remnants.

====Syrian destruction====

Following the August 2013 Ghouta chemical attack, Syria, which had long been suspected of possessing chemical weapons, acknowledged them in September 2013 and agreed to put them under international supervision. On 14 September Syria deposited its instrument of accession to the CWC with the United Nations as the depositary and agreed to its provisional application pending entry into force effective 14 October. An accelerated destruction schedule was devised by Russia and the United States on 14 September, and was endorsed by United Nations Security Council Resolution 2118 and the OPCW Executive Council Decision EC-M-33/DEC.1. Their deadline for destruction was the first half of 2014. Syria gave the OPCW an inventory of its chemical weapons arsenal and began its destruction in October 2013, 2 weeks before its formal entry into force, while applying the convention provisionally. All declared Category 1 materials were destroyed by August 2014. However, the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack in April 2017 indicated that undeclared stockpiles probably remained in the country. A chemical attack on Douma occurred on 7 April 2018 that killed at least 49 civilians with scores injured, and which has been blamed on the Assad government.

Controversy arose in November 2019 over the OPCW&#x27;s finding on the Douma chemical weapons attack when Wikileaks published emails by an OPCW staff member saying a report on this incident &quot;misrepresents the facts&quot; and contains &quot;unintended bias&quot;. The OPCW staff member questioned the report&#x27;s finding that OPCW&#x27;s inspectors had &quot;sufficient evidence at this time to determine that chlorine, or another reactive chlorine-containing chemical, was likely released from cylinders&quot;. The staff member alleged this finding was &quot;highly misleading and not supported by the facts&quot; and said he would attach his own differing observations if this version of the report was released. On 25 November 2019, OPCW Director General Fernando Arias, in a speech to the OPCW&#x27;s annual conference in The Hague, defended the Organization&#x27;s report on the Douma incident, stating &quot;While some of these diverse views continue to circulate in some public discussion forums, I would like to reiterate that I stand by the independent, professional conclusion&quot; of the probe.

====Financial support for destruction====
Financial support for the Albanian and Libyan stockpile destruction programmes was provided by the United States. Russia received support from a number of countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy and Canada; with some $2 billion given by 2004. Costs for Albania&#x27;s program were approximately US$48 million. The United States has spent $20 billion and expected to spend a further $40 billion.

===Known chemical weapons production facilities===
Fourteen states parties declared chemical weapons production facilities (CWPFs):
*1 non-disclosed state party (referred to as &quot;A State Party&quot; in OPCW-communications; said to be South Korea)

Currently all 97 declared production facilities have been deactivated and certified as either destroyed (74) or converted (23) to civilian use.

<text>The Acme Corporation is a fictional corporation that features prominently in the &quot;Road Runner/Wile E. Coyote&quot; animated shorts as a running gag. The company manufactures outlandish products that fail or backfire catastrophically at the worst possible times. The name is also used as a generic title in many cartoons, especially those made by Warner Bros., as well as films, TV series, commercials and comic strips.

==Origin==
The name Acme comes from the Ancient Greek () meaning , , , or . It has been falsely claimed to be an acronym, either for &quot;A Company Making Everything&quot;, &quot;American Companies Make Everything&quot;, or &quot;American Company that Manufactures Everything&quot;. During the 1920s, the word was commonly used in the names of businesses in order to be listed toward the beginning of alphabetized telephone directories like the Yellow Pages, and implied being the best. It is used in an ironic sense in cartoons, because the products are often failure-prone or explosive.

The name Acme began being depicted in film starting in the silent era, such as the 1920 &quot;Neighbors&quot; with Buster Keaton and the 1922 &quot;Grandma&#x27;s Boy&quot; with Harold Lloyd, continuing with TV series, such as in early episodes of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; and &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;, comic strips and cartoons, especially those made by Warner Bros., and commercials. It briefly appeared in the Walt Disney Donald Duck episodes &quot;Cured Duck&quot; released in 1945 and &quot;Three for Breakfast&quot; released in 1948. It also appears as the ACME Mining company owned by the villain Rod Lacy in the 1952 Western &quot;The Duel at Silver Creek&quot; and in a 1938 short &quot;Violent Is the Word for Curly&quot; where The Three Stooges appear as gas station attendants at an &quot;Acme&quot; Service Station. It was also used in &quot;The Pink Panther Show&quot;, where the name Acme was used on several episodes of the show&#x27;s first installment in 1969, one of them being &quot;Pink Pest Control&quot;. 

Warner Brothers animator Chuck Jones described the reason &#x27;Acme&#x27; was used in cartoons at the time:

===Whistles and traffic lights===

A whistle named &#x27;Acme City&#x27;, made from mid-1870s onwards by J Hudson &amp; Co, followed by the &quot;Acme Thunderer&quot;, and &quot;Acme siren&quot; in 1895, were the early brand names bearing the names with the word &#x27;Acme&#x27;. At the time the Acme Traffic Signal Company produced the traffic lights in Los Angeles, the city where Warner Bros. was making its cartoons. Instead of today&#x27;s amber/yellow traffic light, bells rang as the small red and green lights with &quot;Stop&quot; and &quot;Go&quot; semaphore arms changed — a process that took five seconds.

==Depictions==
===In film and TV===
Examples which specifically reference the Wile E. Coyote cartoon character include:

* Films, shows and cartoons based on Looney Tunes characters often deal with Acme Corporation.
** The 1988 film &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; attempted to explain Acme&#x27;s inner workings in detail. The plot is centered on the murder of the corporation&#x27;s owner, Marvin Acme (Stubby Kaye). Many of the film&#x27;s scenes involve Acme products and its final scenes are set in an Acme warehouse.
** The &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot; series expanded on Acme&#x27;s influence, with the entire setting of the show taking place in a city called &quot;Acme Acres&quot;. The show&#x27;s young protagonists attended &quot;Acme Looniversity&quot;. In one episode, the coyote sues Acme, accusing it of making products that are unsafe. 
** The corporation appears as the antagonistic force of &quot;Looney Tunes: Back in Action&quot;. The head offices of Acme are depicted, revealing it to be a multinational corporation whose executive officers are led by the film&#x27;s main antagonist, Mr. Chairman, portrayed by Steve Martin.
** The 2015 direct-to-video animated film &quot;Looney Tunes: Rabbits Run&quot; portrays Acme as a department store.
** In August 2018, Warner Bros. announced they were developing a &quot;Coyote vs. Acme&quot; animated movie, with Chris McKay producing and Jon and Josh Silberman writing the script. By December 2019, the project was reportedly looking for a writer, though Jon and Josh Silberman remained as producers, while Dave Green signed on to direct. A year later, James Gunn was announced as both producer and writer on the project with a release date of July 21, 2023. In February 2022, it was announced that John Cena would star as Acme&#x27;s lawyer. The film was removed from the release schedule in April 2022, and officially cancelled in November 2023. However, public backlash from fans, filmmakers and other creatives in the entertainment industry forced Warner Bros. to reverse that decision and allow the filmmakers to shop the film to other distributors. In February 2024, it was announced that Warner would be going through with cancelling the film after all. On March 10, 2024, Writer of the film, Samy Burch has said that conversations are ongoing to release the film. 
** The cartoon series &quot;Loonatics Unleashed&quot; is set in Acmetropolis.
* The corporation is mentioned in &quot;Animaniacs&quot;, such as the Acme song from Cookies for Einstein, and &quot;Pinky and the Brain&quot;″s home in Acme Labs. In &quot;Wakko&#x27;s Wish&quot;, the &quot;Animaniacs&quot; feature film, characters live in the village of Acme Falls.
* &quot;External World&quot;, a short film by David OReilly, features Acme Retirement Castle, a dystopian retirement facility for disabled cartoon characters.
* In the 1998 Spanish film &quot;The Miracle of P. Tinto&quot;, Acme is referenced along a equally fictional competing spanish business, Mikasa, a pun on E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. When a Mikasa product appears on screen, it is announced in the same tone as Acme products are in the Spanish dubbing of Looney Tunes.
* In the 1978 animated special &quot;Raggedy Ann and Andy in The Great Santa Claus Caper&quot; (written, directed, and co-produced by Chuck Jones), Acme is credited as making Gloopstick, touted as a clear indestructible compound to perfectly preserve toys. Gloopstick is brought to Santa Claus&#x27; workshop by &quot;inefficiency expert&quot; Alexander Graham Wolf, who strongly resembles Wile E. Coyote in appearance and voice.
===Music===

* Bell X1&#x27;s song &quot;One Stringed Harp&quot; includes the lyric &quot;Like Wile E. Coyote/As if the fall wasn&#x27;t enough/Those bastards from Acme/They got more nasty stuff&quot;.
* The Brazilian thrash metal band Chakal has a song titled &quot;Acme Dead End Road&quot; from its 1990 album, &quot;The Man Is His Own Jackal&quot;. The song begins with the Road Runner signature sound &quot;beep, beep&quot;.

===Legal humor===
*Joey Green wrote &quot;Cliff-hanger Justice&quot;, a fictional account of a product liability lawsuit by Wile E. Coyote against Acme, which appeared in three parts in the August, September, and October 1982 issues of &quot;National Lampoon&quot; magazine.
*Ian Frazier wrote a fictional legal complaint &quot;Coyote v. Acme&quot;, which was published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in 1990 and later became the title piece of a short fiction collection. The story would have been the inspiration for the film &quot;Coyote vs. Acme&quot;, but there have been problems that caused the delay and the presumed cancellation of the movie.

===Other===

* The Comprehensive Perl Archive Network provides an &quot;Acme::&quot; namespace which contains many humorous, useless and abstract modules for the Perl programming language. It was named &quot;in homage to that greatest of all absurd system creators: Wile E. Coyote.&quot;
* ACME Communications was a former U.S. broadcasting company established by former Fox Broadcasting Company executive Jamie Kellner. The stations were affiliated with Warner Bros&#x27; broadcast television network The WB, for which he was also a founding executive, and the Acme name was a reference to the cartoon.
* ACME Night is a Cartoon Network block.
* Acme Tools is an online and in store retailer.

==Cultural impact==
*In 2011, &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked ACME as the second largest fictional corporation.

<text>Hans Dürer (born 21 February 1490 in Nuremberg – in Kraków), was a German Renaissance painter, illustrator, and engraver.

== Life ==

Hans Dürer was born Nuremberg, Germany in 1490. He was the son of Albrecht Dürer the Elder and the younger brother of Albrecht Dürer. He was a pupil of his older brother, and also worked in the workshop of Michael Wolgemut in his youth. Hans Dürer was last known to have lived in Nuremberg in 1510. At some point he settled in Kraków, Poland. He was one of the artists hired by King Sigismund I to decorate the rooms of Wawel Castle, and in 1529 he was appointed court painter. His death is recorded as having occurred in 1534, however there is a record of payment for work at the royal castle the following year.

<doc id="51845" wikidata="Q309725" url="?curid=51845" title="Ritchie Valens">
<text>Richard Steven Valenzuela (May 13, 1941 – February 3, 1959), better known by his stage name Ritchie Valens, was an American guitarist, singer and songwriter. A rock and roll pioneer and a forefather of the Chicano rock movement, Valens died in a plane crash just eight months after his breakthrough.

Valens had several hits, most notably &quot;La Bamba&quot;, which he had adapted from a Mexican folk song. Valens transformed the song into one with a rock rhythm and beat, and it became a hit in 1958, making Valens a pioneer of the Spanish-speaking rock and roll movement. He also had an American number-two hit with &quot;Donna&quot;.

On February 3, 1959, on what has become known as &quot;The Day the Music Died&quot;, Valens died in a plane crash in Iowa, an accident that also claimed the lives of fellow musicians Buddy Holly and J. P. &quot;The Big Bopper&quot; Richardson, as well as pilot Roger Peterson. Valens was 17 years old at the time of his death. He was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the Rockabilly Hall of Fame, the Native American Music Awards Hall of Fame, the California Hall of Fame, and has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

==Early life==
Valens was born as Richard Steven Valenzuela on May 13, 1941, in Pacoima, a neighborhood in the San Fernando Valley region of Los Angeles. The son of Joseph Steven Valenzuela (1896–1952) and Concepción &quot;Concha&quot; Reyes (1915–1987), he had two half-brothers, Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Morales (1937–2018) and Mario Ramirez, and two younger sisters, Connie and Irma.

Valenzuela was brought up hearing traditional Mexican mariachi music, as well as flamenco guitar, R&amp;B, and jump blues. He expressed an interest in making music of his own by the age of five. Valenzuela was encouraged by his father to take up guitar and trumpet, and later taught himself the drums. Though Valenzuela was left-handed, he was so eager to learn the guitar that he mastered the traditional right-handed version of the instrument.

Valenzuela was a 15-year-old student at Pacoima Junior High School at the time of the 1957 Pacoima mid-air collision. He was not at school that day since he was attending his grandfather&#x27;s funeral. Recurring nightmares of the disaster led to Valens&#x27;s fear of flying.

By the time Valenzuela was attending Pacoima Junior High School (now Pacoima Middle School), he would bring his guitar to school and sing and play songs to his friends on the bleachers.

When Valenzuela was 16 years old, he was invited to join a local band, The Silhouettes (not to be confused with the group of the same name famous for its hit song &quot;Get a Job&quot;). Valenzuela began as a guitarist, and when the main vocalist left the group, he took over the position. On June 19, 1957, Valenzuela made his performing debut with The Silhouettes.

Valenzuela also attended San Fernando High School.

==Career==

A self-taught musician, Valenzuela was an accomplished singer and guitarist. At his appearances, Valenzuela often improvised new lyrics and added new riffs to popular songs while he was playing.

Bob Keane, the owner and president of small record label Del-Fi Records in Hollywood, was given a tip in May 1958 by San Fernando High School student Doug Macchia about a young performer from Pacoima by the name of Richard Valenzuela. Kids knew the performer as &quot;the Little Richard of San Fernando&quot;. Swayed by the Little Richard comparison, Keane went to see Valenzuela play a Saturday-morning matinée at a movie theater in San Fernando. Impressed by the performance, he invited Valenzuela to audition at his home in the Silver Lake area of Los Angeles, where he had a small recording studio in his basement. His recording equipment comprised an early stereo recorder (a two-track Ampex 601-2 portable) and a pair of Neumann U-47 condenser microphones.
After this first audition, Keane signed Valenzuela to Del-Fi on May 14, 1958. At this point, the musician took the name &quot;Ritchie&quot; because, as Keane said, &quot;There were a bunch of &#x27;Richards&#x27; around at that time, and I wanted it to be different.&quot; Similarly, Keane recommended shortening his surname to &quot;Valens&quot; from Valenzuela to widen his appeal beyond any obvious ethnic group. Valens was ready to enter the studio with a full band backing him. The musicians included René Hall, Carol Kaye, and Earl Palmer. The first songs recorded at Gold Star Studios, at a single studio session one afternoon in May 1958, were &quot;Come On, Let&#x27;s Go&quot;, an original, credited to Valens/Kuhn (Keane&#x27;s real name), and &quot;Framed&quot;, a Leiber and Stoller tune. Pressed and released within days of the recording session, the record was a success. Valens&#x27; next record, a double A-side, had the song &quot;Donna&quot; (written about a real girlfriend Donna Ludwig) coupled with &quot;La Bamba&quot;. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc by the Recording Industry Association of America.

By the autumn of 1958, the demands of Valens&#x27;s career forced him to drop out of high school. Keane booked appearances at venues across the United States and performances on television programs.
=== Concerts and appearances (late 1958–early 1959) ===
On October 6, 1958, Valens made his first appearance on Dick Clark&#x27;s &quot;American Bandstand&quot; singing &quot;Come On, Let&#x27;s Go&quot;. Soon after, Valens traveled to Honolulu, Hawaii, to perform under the banner of the &quot;11th Show of Stars&quot;. On December 10, 1958, after his trip to Honolulu, Valens made an appearance back at Pacoima Junior High School (now Pacoima Middle School). This concert was posthumously released as &quot;Ritchie Valens in Concert at Pacoima Jr. High&quot;; it was Valens&#x27; only live performance ever recorded. In mid-December 1958, Valens left for New York City. Keane had managed to book him as a late addition to &quot;Alan Freed&#x27;s Christmas Jubilee Show&quot; where Valens performed with The Everly Brothers, Bo Diddley, Chuck Berry, Jackie Wilson, Eddie Cochran and others. On December 27, Valens performed &quot;Donna&quot; on &quot;The Dick Clark Show&quot;. He played a few more shows in New York, including his only performance at the famous Apollo Theater. On January 17, 1959, he appeared at West Covina High School with Sam Cooke for a student organized fundraiser called &quot;The Teen Canteen Foundation&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Valens was in a relationship with Donna Ludwig, his high school sweetheart, from 1957 until his death. Ludwig&#x27;s parents disapproved of her dating a Hispanic man. Valens&#x27;s song &quot;Donna&quot; was written for her. Their relationship became strained due to Valens&#x27; increasing popularity and touring. After his death, Elvis Presley had one of his bodyguards arrange a date with Ludwig so that he could know all about Valens. In 1987, she attended the premiere of &quot;La Bamba&quot;, a biopic featuring the life and career of Valens.

== Winter Dance Party tour and death (1959) ==

Valens was one of the five acts billed for the Winter Dance Party tour, performing with Buddy Holly, &quot;The Big Bopper&quot; J. P. Richardson, Dion and the Belmonts, and Frankie Sardo beginning on January 23, 1959, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The tour was plagued by subzero temperatures and numerous logistical problems. The unheated tour buses twice broke down in freezing weather, with Valens and Richardson experiencing flu-like symptoms throughout the tour. After the bus stalled in Duluth, Minnesota on January 31, conditions were so bad that Holly&#x27;s drummer, Carl Bunch, was hospitalized for severe frostbite sustained on the bus. To fill in for Bunch, Holly, Valens, and Dion all took turns drumming for one another.

After the February 2, 1959, performance in Clear Lake, Iowa (which ended around midnight), Holly, Richardson, and Valens flew out of the Mason City airport in a small plane that Holly had chartered. Valens was on the plane since he won a coin toss with Holly&#x27;s backup guitarist Tommy Allsup. Bob Hale, a disc jockey with Mason City&#x27;s KRIB-AM, was emceeing the concert that night and flipped the coin in the ballroom&#x27;s side-stage room shortly before the musicians departed for the airport. Valens is apocryphally said to have remarked, &quot;That&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve ever won anything in my life.&quot; Holly&#x27;s bassist, Waylon Jennings, voluntarily gave up his seat on the plane to J.P. Richardson, who was ill with the flu. 

At around 12:55 a.m. on February 3, 1959, the four-passenger Beechcraft Bonanza, (N3794N), departed for Fargo, North Dakota, and crashed a few minutes after takeoff. The cause was apparently loss of control by the pilot Roger Peterson, who was not qualified for the deteriorating weather. The crash killed all the four men instantly upon impact. As with Holly, Richardson and Peterson, Valens suffered massive fatal head injuries along with blunt-force trauma to the chest. At 17 years old, Valens was the youngest to die in the crash.

The tragedy inspired singer Don McLean to write his 1971 hit &quot;American Pie&quot;, immortalizing February 3 as &quot;The Day the Music Died&quot;. Valens&#x27; remains were buried at San Fernando Mission Cemetery in Mission Hills, Los Angeles, California.

==Legacy==
Valens was a pioneer of Chicano rock and Latin rock, inspiring many musicians of Mexican heritage. He influenced the likes of Los Lobos, Los Lonely Boys, and Carlos Santana, as Valens had become nationally successful at a time when very few Latinos were in American rock and pop music. He is considered the first Latino to successfully cross over into mainstream rock.

&quot;La Bamba&quot; proved to be his most influential recording, not only by becoming a pop chart hit sung entirely in Spanish, but also because of its successful blending of traditional Latin American music with rock. Valens was the first to capitalize on this formula, which was later adopted by such varied artists as Carlos Santana, Selena, Caifanes, Café Tacuba, Circo, El Gran Silencio, Aterciopelados, Gustavo Santaolalla, and many others in the Latin alternative scene. The Valenzuela family spoke only English at home, and he knew very little Spanish. Valens learned the lyrics phonetically to record &quot;La Bamba&quot; in Spanish. In 2019, the Valens version of &quot;La Bamba&quot; was selected by the U.S. Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry as &quot;culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant&quot;.

Valens was nominated for a Grammy Award for Song of the Year in 1988 for La Bamba.

In 2015, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine listed Valens on its list of the 30 most influential Latino artists in history, citing &quot;the influence of the Rock and Roll Hall of Famer lives on in today&#x27;s Latin alternative artists&quot; and also citing &quot;the pioneering Latino artists&#x27;s enduring crossover hit &quot;La Bamba&quot; proved early on that Mexican-rooted music and Spanish lyrics appealed to the mainstream&quot;.

&quot;Come On, Let&#x27;s Go&quot; has been recorded by Los Lobos, the Ramones and the Paley Brothers (the Ramones on guitar, bass, and drums and the Paley Brothers on vocals), Tommy Steele, the Huntingtons, Girl in a Coma, and the McCoys. Johnny Rebb and his Rebels recorded the song for Leedon/Canetoad Records in Australia. &quot;Donna&quot; has been recorded by artists as diverse as MxPx, Marty Wilde, the Youngbloods, Clem Snide, Cappadonna, and Misfits.

Robert Quine has cited Valens&#x27;s guitar playing as an early influence on his style. Valens also inspired Jimi Hendrix, Chan Romero, Carlos Santana, The Beatles, Chris Montez, Keith O&#x27;Conner Murphy, The Beach Boys and Led Zeppelin, among others.

Valens&#x27;s mother, Concha, who died in 1987, is buried alongside him.

==Representation in other media==
* Valens has been the subject of several biopic films, including the 1987 film &quot;La Bamba&quot;. Primarily set in 1957–1959, it depicted Valens from age 16 to 17. It introduced Lou Diamond Phillips as Valens. Los Lobos performed most of the music in the film.
* Valens was portrayed by Gilbert Melgar in the final scene of the 1978 film, &quot;The Buddy Holly Story.&quot;
* Lil&#x27; Libros released a picture book based on Valens&#x27; life in 2019.
* On August 26, 2024, it was announced that a new biopic was in the works. The movie will be released through Mucho Mas Media and Sony Pictures with Luis Valdez, the writer and director of the original 1987 film, serving as an executive producer along with writer José Rivera attached to write the script.

==Tributes==

In 1989, Ken Paquette, a Wisconsin fan of the 1950s era, erected a stainless-steel monument depicting a guitar and a set of three records bearing the names of each of the three performers killed in the accident. It is located on private farmland, about west of the intersection of 315th Street and Gull Avenue, about north of Clear Lake. He also created a similar stainless-steel monument to the three musicians that was installed near the Riverside Ballroom in Green Bay, Wisconsin. That memorial was unveiled on July 17, 2003.

Paxton Park in Pacoima was renamed Ritchie Valens Recreation Center in memory of Valens in the 1990s. There is also a pool nearby named the Ritchie Valens Pool. At the recreation center, there is also a skatepark named Ritchie Valens Skate Plaza. A city council member representing Pacoima proposed the renaming to honor Valens so residents would &quot;remember his humble background and emulate his accomplishments.&quot;

Musician Tommy Allsup started a club, &quot;Tommy&#x27;s Heads Up Saloon&quot;, in Dallas in 1979. The club was named for the fateful coin toss between Valens and him twenty years prior.

&quot;Boogie with Stu&quot; from Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot; album was inspired by Valens&#x27; song &quot;Ooh, My Head&quot;. It did not credit Valens or Bob Keane, instead crediting Valens&#x27; mother. Eventually, a lawsuit was filed by Keane, and half of the award went to Valens&#x27; mother, although she was not part of the suit.

On May 11, 1990, a star bearing Valens&#x27; name was unveiled on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The star cost $3,500, which was paid for with money raised in his name by family and friends. His star permanently resides at 6733 Hollywood Boulevard in front of Artisan&#x27;s Patio mini mall.

On February 2, 2009, Surf Ballroom held a 50th anniversary honoring the last concert of Buddy Holly, J.P. &quot;The Big Bopper&quot; Richardson, and Valens. The event lasted one week and had performances that honored the memories of the three men. Family members and friends of the stars made appearances.

Many murals have been painted around Pacoima in honor of the late Valens.
In 1985, artist Manuel Velasquez (assisted by 25 students) created a 12- by 20-ft (3.6- by 6.1 meters) mural, which was painted on the side of a classroom building at the former Pacoima Junior High (now Pacoima Middle School) depicting Valens&#x27;s image, records labeled with some of his greatest hits, and the newspaper article about the plane crash that took his life.
Another mural went up in 2012 at the intersection of Van Nuys Boulevard and Amboy Avenue, which was painted by Hector Ponce. A second one was painted in 2012 by Levi Ponce and is located on Van Nuys Boulevard and Telfair Avenue. A monument has also been built as a tribute. It was put on display in 2013, and is located at Ritchie Valens Park at 10731 Laurel Canyon Boulevard.

On May 13, 2016, the 75th anniversary of Valens&#x27; birthday, the Los Angeles City Council declared May 13 &quot;Ritchie Valens Day&quot;.

A section of the Interstate 5 Freeway in the northeast San Fernando Valley has been named after Valens. The Ritchie Valens Memorial Highway is located between the 170 and 118 freeways. On August 25, 2018, a celebration was held in his honor to commemorate his legacy. The unveiling ceremony was held at Ritchie Valens Park, located at 10731 Laurel Canyon Boulevard in Pacoima. Replicas of the freeway sign were revealed at the celebration. The event was open to the public and free to attend. A few relatives of Valens played live performances as a tribute to the late singer. Leaders from the community and state gathered for the festivities.

In May 2022, the United States Post Office in Pacoima, California was renamed the Ritchie Valens Post Office in honor of Valens.

<text>Daffy Duck is an animated cartoon character created by animators Tex Avery and Bob Clampett for Leon Schlesinger Productions. Styled as an anthropomorphic black duck, he has appeared in cartoon series such as &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot;, in which he is usually depicted as a foil for either Bugs Bunny, Porky Pig or Speedy Gonzales. He was one of the first of the new &quot;&quot; characters that emerged in the late 1930s to replace traditional everyman characters who were more popular earlier in the decade, such as Mickey Mouse, Porky Pig, and Popeye.

Daffy starred in 130 shorts in the golden age, making him the third-most frequent character in the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot;/&quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; cartoons, behind Bugs Bunny&#x27;s 167 appearances and Porky Pig&#x27;s 153 appearances. Virtually every Warner Bros. cartoon director, most notably Bob Clampett, Robert McKimson, and Chuck Jones, put his own spin on the Daffy Duck character.

He was ranked number 14 on &quot;TV Guide&quot;s list of top 50 greatest cartoon characters.

==History==

===Origin===
Daffy first appeared in &quot;Porky&#x27;s Duck Hunt&quot;, released on April 17, 1937. The cartoon was directed by Tex Avery and animated by Bob Clampett. &quot;Porky&#x27;s Duck Hunt&quot; is a standard hunter/prey pairing, but Daffy (barely more than an unnamed bit player in this short) was something new to moviegoers: an assertive, completely unrestrained, combative protagonist. Clampett later recalled:
: &quot;At that time, audiences weren&#x27;t accustomed to seeing a cartoon character do these things. And so, when it hit the theaters it was an explosion. People would leave the theaters talking about this daffy duck.&quot;

This early Daffy is less anthropomorphic and resembles a normal black duck. In fact, the only aspects of the character that have remained consistent through the years are his voice characterization by Mel Blanc; and his black feathers with a white neck ring. Blanc&#x27;s characterization of Daffy once held the world record for the longest characterization of one animated character by their original actor: 52 years.

The origin of Daffy&#x27;s voice, with its lateral lisp, is a matter of some debate. One often-repeated &quot;official&quot; story is that it was modeled after producer Leon Schlesinger&#x27;s tendency to lisp. However, in Mel Blanc&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;That&#x27;s Not All Folks!&quot;, he contradicts that conventional belief, writing, &quot;It seemed to me that such an extended mandible would hinder his speech, particularly on words containing an &quot;s&quot; sound. Thus &#x27;despicable&#x27; became &#x27;des&quot;th-&quot;picable.&#x27;&quot;

Daffy&#x27;s slobbery, exaggerated lisp was developed over time, and it is barely noticeable in the early cartoons. In &quot;Daffy Duck &amp; Egghead&quot;, Daffy does not lisp at all except in the separately drawn set-piece of Daffy singing &quot;The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down&quot; in which just a slight lisp can be heard.

In &quot;The Scarlet Pumpernickel&quot; (1950), Daffy has a middle name, Dumas as the writer of a swashbuckling script, a nod to Alexandre Dumas. Also, in the &quot;Baby Looney Tunes&quot; episode &quot;The Tattletale&quot;, Granny addresses Daffy as &quot;Daffy Horatio Tiberius Duck&quot;. In &quot;The Looney Tunes Show&quot; (2011), the joke middle names &quot;Armando&quot; and &quot;Sheldon&quot; are used.

===Golden Age Years===
====Daffy&#x27;s early years, 1937–1940====
Tex Avery and Bob Clampett created the original version of Daffy in 1937. Daffy established his status by jumping into the water, hopping around, and yelling, &quot;Woo-hoo!&quot; Animator Bob Clampett immediately seized upon the Daffy Duck character and cast him in a series of cartoons in the 1930s and 1940s. The early Daffy is a wild and zany screwball, perpetually bouncing around the screen with cries of &quot;Hoo-hoo! Hoo-hoo!&quot; (In his autobiography, Mel Blanc stated that the zany demeanor was inspired by Hugh Herbert&#x27;s catchphrase, which was taken to a wild extreme for Daffy.)

====World War II Daffy, 1941–1945====

Daffy would also feature in several war-themed shorts during World War II, remaining true to his unbridled nature. He battles a Nazi goat intent on eating Daffy&#x27;s scrap metal in &quot;Scrap Happy Daffy&quot; (1943), hits Adolf Hitler&#x27;s head with a giant mallet in &quot;Daffy the Commando&quot; (1943) and outwits Hitler, Goebbels and Goering in &quot;Plane Daffy&quot; (1944). Oddly enough, it was only after these wartime escapades that Daffy is actually subject to conscription into military service, in the form of &quot;the little man from the draft board&quot;, whom he tries to dodge in &quot;Draftee Daffy&quot; (1945).

====Evolving &quot;Earlier&quot; Daffy 1946–1952====
For &quot;Daffy Doodles&quot; (his first &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; cartoon as a director), Robert McKimson tamed Daffy a bit, redesigning him yet again to be rounder and less elastic. The studio also instilled some of Bugs Bunny&#x27;s savvy into the duck, making him as brilliant with his mouth as he was with his battiness. Daffy was teamed up with Porky Pig; the duck&#x27;s one-time rival became his straight man. Arthur Davis, who directed Warner Bros. cartoon shorts for a few years in the late 1940s until upper management decreed there should be only three units (McKimson, Friz Freleng, and Jones), presented a Daffy similar to McKimson&#x27;s. McKimson is noted as the last of the three units to make his Daffy uniform with Jones&#x27;s, with even late shorts, such as &quot;Don&#x27;t Axe Me&quot; (1958), featuring traits of the &quot;screwball&quot; Daffy. Starting in &quot;You Were Never Duckier&quot;, Daffy&#x27;s personality evolved to be less loony and more greedy.

====Experimenting with Daffy 1953–1964====
While Daffy&#x27;s looney days were over, McKimson continued to make him as bad or good as his various roles required him to be. McKimson would use this Daffy from 1946 to 1961. Although, even McKimson would follow in Jones&#x27; footsteps in many aspects with cartoons like &quot;People Are Bunny&quot; (1959) and &quot;Ducking the Devil&quot; (1957). Friz Freleng&#x27;s version took a hint from Chuck Jones to make the duck more sympathetic, as in the 1957 &quot;Show Biz Bugs&quot;. Here, Daffy is overemotional and jealous of Bugs, yet he has real talent that is ignored by the theater manager and the crowd. This cartoon finishes with a sequence in which Daffy attempts to wow the Bugs-besotted audience with an act in which he drinks gasoline and swallows nitroglycerine, gunpowder, and uranium-238 (in a greenish solution), jumps up and down to &quot;shake well&quot; and finally swallows a lit match that detonates the whole improbable mixture. When Bugs tells Daffy that the audience loves the act and wants more, Daffy, now a ghost floating upward (presumably to Heaven), says that he can only do the act once. Some TV stations, and in the 1990s the cable network TNT, edited out the dangerous act, afraid of imitation by young children.

====Pairing of Daffy and Porky in parodies of popular movies, 1951–1965====
While Bugs Bunny became Warner Bros.&#x27; most popular character, the directors still found ample use for Daffy. Several cartoons place him in parodies of popular movies and radio serials; Porky Pig was usually a comic relief sidekick. For example, Daffy in &quot;The Great Piggy Bank Robbery&quot; (1946) as &quot;Duck Twacy&quot; (Dick Tracy) by Bob Clampett; in &quot;The Scarlet Pumpernickel&quot; (1950), Daffy was the hero and Porky Pig was the villain. In &quot;Drip-Along Daffy&quot; (1951), named after the Hopalong Cassidy character, throws Daffy into a Western with him labeled &quot;Western-Type Hero&quot; and Porky Pig labeled &quot;Comedy Relief&quot;. In &quot;Duck Dodgers in the 24½th Century&quot; (1953), a parody of &quot;Buck Rogers&quot;, Daffy trades barbs (and bullets) with Marvin the Martian, with Porky Pig retaining the role of Daffy&#x27;s sidekick. In &quot;Rocket Squad&quot; (1956), a parody of &quot;Dragnet&quot; and &quot;Racket Squad&quot;, Daffy and Porky Pig pair up once again. Daffy also played &quot;Stupor Duck&quot;, a parody of the &quot;Adventures of Superman&quot; television series. &quot;Robin Hood Daffy&quot; (1958) casts the duck in the role of the legendary outlaw Robin Hood with Porky Pig as Friar Tuck. Besides parodies, Daffy also played a salesman who continually annoys a potential customer into buying something: in &quot;Fool Coverage&quot;, Daffy actually succeeds into selling Porky Pig a $1,000,000 accident policy which only works under impossible conditions. Unfortunately for Daffy, all the conditions happen.

====Pairing of Bugs and Daffy, 1951–1964====
Bugs&#x27;s ascension to stardom also prompted the Warner Bros. animators to recast Daffy as the rabbit&#x27;s rival, intensely jealous, insecure and determined to steal back the spotlight, while Bugs either remained cool headed but mildly amused and/or indifferent to the duck&#x27;s jealousy, sometimes using it to his advantage. Daffy&#x27;s desire to achieve stardom at almost any cost was explored as early as 1940 in Freleng&#x27;s &quot;You Ought to Be in Pictures&quot;, but the idea was most successfully used by Chuck Jones, who redesigned the duck once again, making him scrawnier and scruffier. In Jones&#x27; &quot;Hunting Trilogy&quot; (or &quot;Duck Season/Rabbit Season Trilogy&quot;) of &quot;Rabbit Fire&quot;, &quot;Rabbit Seasoning&quot; and &quot;Duck! Rabbit, Duck!&quot; (each respectively launched in 1951, 1952, and 1953), Daffy&#x27;s attention-grabbing ways and excitability provide Bugs Bunny the perfect opportunity to fool the hapless Elmer Fudd into repeatedly shooting the duck&#x27;s bill off. Also, these cartoons reveal Daffy&#x27;s catchphrase, &quot;Youuu&#x27;re deththpicable!&quot;. Jones&#x27; Daffy sees himself as self-preservationist, not selfish. However, this Daffy can do nothing that does not backfire on him, more likely to singe his tail feathers as well as his ego and pride than anything. It is thought that Chuck Jones based Daffy Duck&#x27;s new personality on his fellow animator Bob Clampett, who, like Daffy, was known as a loud self-promoter. In &quot;Beanstalk Bunny&quot; Daffy, Bugs and Elmer are once again teamed up in a parody of &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot; (with Elmer as the giant); in &quot;A Star Is Bored&quot; Daffy tries to upstage Bugs Bunny. In the spoofs of the TV shows &quot;The Millionaire&quot; and &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;, Daffy tries to defeat his arch-rival Bugs Bunny for a $1,000,000.00 prize given out by his favorite TV show in &quot;The Million Hare&quot; and in &quot;This Is a Life?&quot;, Daffy tries to upstage Bugs Bunny in order to be the guest of honor on the show; in all four of these cartoons Daffy ends up a loser because of his own overemotional personality (which impairs Daffy&#x27;s common sense and reasoning ability) and his craving for attention.

====Solo Daffy====
Film critic Steve Schneider calls Jones&#x27; version of Daffy &quot;a kind of unleashed id.&quot; Jones said that his version of the character &quot;expresses all of the things we&#x27;re afraid to express.&quot; This is evident in Jones&#x27; &quot;Duck Amuck&quot; (1953), &quot;one of the few unarguable masterpieces of American animation&quot; according to Schneider. In the episode, Daffy is plagued by a godlike animator whose malicious paintbrush alters the setting, soundtrack, and even Daffy. When Daffy demands to know who is responsible for the changes, the camera pulls back to reveal none other than Bugs Bunny. &quot;Duck Amuck&quot; is widely heralded as a classic of filmmaking for its illustration that a character&#x27;s personality can be recognized independently of appearance, setting, voice, and plot. In 1999, the short was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.

====Daffy&#x27;s pairing with Speedy in 1965–1968====
When the Warner Bros. animation studio briefly outsourced cartoon production to DePatie-Freleng Enterprises (DFE) in the 1960s, Daffy Duck became an antagonist in several cartoons opposite Speedy Gonzales, who refers to Daffy as &quot;the loco duck.&quot; In &quot;Well Worn Daffy&quot; (1965), Daffy is determined to keep the mice away from a desperately needed well seemingly for no other motive than pure maliciousness. Furthermore, when he draws all the water he wants, Daffy then attempts to destroy the well in spite of the vicious pointlessness of the act, forcing Speedy to stop him. The Warner Bros. studio was entering its twilight years, and even Daffy had to stretch for humor in the period. In many of the later DFE cartoons, such as &quot;Feather Finger&quot; and &quot;Daffy&#x27;s Diner&quot;, Daffy is portrayed as a more sympathetic character (often forced to turn against Speedy at the behest of a common enemy) rather than the full-blown villain he is in cartoons like &quot;Assault and Peppered&quot;. The last cartoon featuring Daffy and Speedy is &quot;See Ya Later Gladiator&quot;, in what animation fans call the worst cartoon made by Warner Bros.

===&quot;The Daffy Duck Show&quot;===
In light of the longstanding popularity of &quot;The Bugs Bunny Show&quot; and its various incarnations on CBS and ABC, NBC commissioned their own half-hour series, &quot;The Daffy Duck Show&quot;, which began airing in the fall of 1978. While some well-known titles were included in the program, most of the cartoons featured on the series were from the late &#x27;60s Depatie-Freleng run. The program ran on NBC for two years, then in 1981 was rechristened &quot;The Daffy/Speedy Show&quot; and ran for another two years. Eventually, NBC canceled the series, and many of the cartoons were reintegrated into the lineups for the respective CBS and ABC &quot;Bugs Bunny&quot; shows.

===More recent years===

Daffy appeared in later cartoons. He was one of many &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; characters allowed by Warner Bros. to appear in the 1988 Disney/Amblin film &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;. In the film, Daffy (utilizing his original, wacky characterization) shares a scene with his Disney counterpart Donald Duck whilst performing in a piano duel. In 1987, to celebrate Daffy&#x27;s 50th anniversary, Warner Bros. released &quot;The Duxorcist&quot; as its first theatrical &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; short in two decades. Daffy Duck also appeared in several feature-film compilations, including two films centered around himself. The first was released in 1983, &quot;Daffy Duck&#x27;s Fantastic Island&quot;; the second came in 1988, &quot;Daffy Duck&#x27;s Quackbusters&quot;, which is considered one of the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot;&#x27; best compilation films and featured another new theatrical short, &quot;The Night of the Living Duck&quot;. Daffy has also had major roles in films such as &quot;Space Jam&quot; in 1996 and &quot;Looney Tunes: Back in Action&quot; in 2003. The latter film does much to flesh out his character, even going so far as to cast a sympathetic light on Daffy&#x27;s glory-seeking ways in one scene, where he complains that he works tirelessly without achieving what Bugs does without even trying. That same year, Warner Bros. cast him in a brand-new &quot;Duck Dodgers&quot; series. (It should be stressed that in this show, Duck Dodgers actually is Daffy Duck due to him being frozen in suspended animation in some unknown incident.) He had a cameo appearance in &quot;The Sylvester &amp; Tweety Mysteries&quot; episode &quot;When Granny Ruled the Earth&quot;, first airing on March 27, 1999. Daffy has also been featured in several webtoons, which can be viewed online.

Daffy has also made appearances on numerous television series. In &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot;, Daffy is a teacher at Acme Looniversity, where he is the hero and mentor of student Plucky Duck. He is shown as a baby in &quot;Baby Looney Tunes&quot;, and appears to have a similar personality to his earlier years with his rivalry with Bugs and saying, &quot;Woo-hoo!&quot; often in the show. He made occasional cameo appearances on &quot;Animaniacs&quot; and &quot;Histeria!&quot;. In &quot;Loonatics Unleashed&quot;, his descendant is Danger Duck (voiced by Jason Marsden), whom his teammates consider lame and unpopular. A majority of these appearances try to emulate Chuck Jones&#x27; incarnation of the character.

Daffy has also been given larger roles in more recent &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; films and series. Following &quot;Looney Tunes: Back in Action&quot;, Warner Bros. has slowly moved the spotlight away from Bugs and more towards Daffy, as shown in the 2006 direct-to-video movie &quot;Bah, Humduck! A Looney Tunes Christmas&quot;, where Daffy plays the lead, while Bugs appears in a minor supporting role.
However, more recent merchandise of the duck, as well as that featured on the official website, have been shown to incorporate elements of the zanier, more light-hearted Daffy of the 1930s and 1940s. Producer Larry Doyle noted that recent theatrical cartoons were planned that would portray a more diverse Daffy closer to that of Robert McKimson&#x27;s design; however, due to the box office bomb of &quot;Looney Tunes: Back in Action&quot;, these new films ceased production.

Daffy returned to Cartoon Network in &quot;The Looney Tunes Show&quot;, voiced by Jeff Bergman. In the show, he has moved out of the forest and shares Bugs&#x27; house with him. Unlike Bugs and their neighbors, Daffy has no way of earning money and relies on Bugs for food and shelter. He tried on numerous occasions to get rich quick, but ended up failing repeatedly. Daffy&#x27;s one possession he is proud of is his paper-mache parade float, constructed on top of a flatbed truck, which is his main means of transportation. While Daffy&#x27;s greed and jealousy of Bugs remains, he appears to be less antagonistic in this show, as Bugs even tells Daffy in spite of his faults, he is Bugs&#x27; best friend and vice versa. Daffy serves as a sort of mentor to Gossamer. Daffy has difficulty telling fiction from reality; he often confuses television shows for his own life, believes Bugs is Superman, and at one point hallucinates he is a wizard.

Daffy starred in the 3-D short &quot;Daffy&#x27;s Rhapsody&quot; with Elmer Fudd that was originally set to premiere before &quot;Happy Feet Two&quot; but instead debuted prior to &quot;Journey 2: The Mysterious Island&quot;. The short features Daffy and Elmer in the first CG or 3-D depiction of these specific &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; characters. According to Matthew O&#x27;Callaghan, who directed the short, the audio comes from a 1950s recording for a children&#x27;s album. Daffy is performing in a hunting musical, when Elmer, who is in the audience, pursues him. Daffy is initially unaware of the danger, but quickly realizes the threat Elmer poses and outwits him by using the props against him.

Daffy appeared in the 2015 DTV movie &quot;Looney Tunes: Rabbits Run&quot;.

Daffy appears in the Cartoon Network series &quot;New Looney Tunes&quot; where he is voiced by Dee Bradley Baker. Daffy is often paired with Porky where Daffy will annoy and bedevil the pig, though occasionally Porky one ups Daffy.

Daffy appears in &quot;Looney Tunes Cartoons&quot;, where he is voiced by Eric Bauza.

Daffy appears in the preschool series &quot;Bugs Bunny Builders&quot; which currently airs on Cartoon Network&#x27;s Cartoonito block and HBO Max. Eric Bauza reprises his role.

==Cartoons==
==Comics==
Dell Comics published several Daffy Duck comic books, beginning in &quot;Four Color Comics&quot; #457, #536, and #615 and then continuing as &quot;Daffy&quot; #4-17 (1956–59), then as &quot;Daffy Duck&quot; #18-30 (1959–62). The comic book series was subsequently continued in Gold Key Comics &quot;Daffy Duck&quot; #31-127 (1962–79). This run was in turn continued under the Whitman Comics imprint until the company completely ceased comic book publication in 1984. In 1994, corporate cousin DC Comics became the publisher for comics featuring all the classic Warner Bros. cartoon characters, and while not getting his own title, Daffy has appeared in many issues of &quot;Looney Tunes&quot;.

==Other media==
* In 1991, Daffy Duck had a number 58 hit in the UK charts with a house/dance record called &quot;Party Zone&quot;, a record which featured songwriters/producers Giorgio and Martin Koppehele under one of their aliases, The Groove Gang (other aliases have included G. + M. Cope and Cymurai), and singers Marcus Deon Thomas and Aimee McCoy from Splash. The record was issued by Warner&#x27;s eastwest label and spent three weeks in the UK charts. Its release was followed by &quot;Dynamite&quot; in 1992.
* In 1999, the United States Postal Service issued a 33 cent stamp, designed and illustrated by Ed Wleczyk of Warner Bros., featuring Daffy leaning against a rural mailbox with a &quot;that&#x27;s despicable&quot; look directed at two letters in the mailbox that bear Bugs Bunny stamps.
* Daffy makes a vocal cameo appearance in the 2020 &quot;Animaniacs&quot; revival segment &quot;Suffragette City&quot;, with Eric Bauza reprising his role.
