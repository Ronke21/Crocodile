<text>The Kru languages are spoken by the Kru people from the southeast of Liberia to the west of Ivory Coast.

==Classification==
According to Güldemann (2018), Kru lacks sufficient lexical resemblances and noun class resemblances to conclude a relationship with Niger-Congo. Glottolog considers Kru an independent language family.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;Kru&quot; is of unknown origin. According to Westermann (1952) it was used by Europeans to denote a number of tribes speaking related dialects. Marchese (1989) notes the fact that many of these peoples were recruited as &quot;crew&quot; by European seafarers; &quot;the homonymy with crew is obvious, and is at least one source of the confusion among Europeans that there was a Kru/crew tribe&quot;. 

==History==
Andrew Dalby noted the historical importance of the Kru languages for their position at the crossroads of African-European interaction. He wrote that &quot;Kru and associated languages were among the first to be encountered by European voyagers on what was then known as the Pepper Coast, a centre of the production and export of Guinea and melegueta pepper; a once staple African seaborne trade&quot;. The Kru languages are known for some of the most complex tone systems in Africa, rivaled perhaps only by the Omotic languages.

==Current status==

Recent documentation has noted &quot;Kru societies can now be found along the coast of Monrovia, Liberia to Bandama River in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire&quot;. &quot;Villages maintain their ties based on presumed common descent, reinforced by ceremonial exchanges and gifts&quot;. The Kru people and their languages, although now many speak English (in Liberia) or French (in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire) as a second language, are said to be &quot;dominant in the southwest region where the forest zone reaches the coastal lagoons&quot;. The Kru people rely on the forest for farming, supplemented by hunting for their livelihood.

== Subgroups and associated languages ==
The Kru languages include many subgroups such as Kuwaa, Grebo, Bassa, Belle, Belleh, Kwaa and many others. According to Breitbonde, categorization of communities based on cultural distinctiveness, historical or ethnic identity, and socio-political autonomy &quot;may have brought about the large number of distinct Kru dialects; &quot;Although the natives were in many respects similar in type and tribe, every village was an independent state; there was also very little intercommunication&quot;. Breitbonde notes the Kru people were categorized based on their cultural distinctiveness, separate historical or ethnic identities, and social and political autonomy. This is the possible reason for so many subgroups of the Kru language. As noted by Fisiak, there is very little documentation on the Kru and associated languages.

Marchese&#x27;s (1989) classification of Kru languages is as follows. Many of these languages are dialect clusters and are sometimes considered more than a single language.

==Reconstruction==

According to Marchese Zogbo (2012), Proto-Kru had:

*phonemic nasalized vowels
*four level tones
* *CVCV-(C)V and probably *CVV syllable structure. *CCV syllables, and possibly also *CVV syllables, are derived from *CVCV roots.
*SVO word order, but with much OV typology
*suffixing morphology
*perfective and imperfective aspects

Proto-Kru consonants (Marchese Zogbo 2012):
Derived consonants:
*/ɟ/ is likely derived via palatalization (*g &gt; ɟ), e.g. *gie &gt; ɟie.
* *c, *ɲ, *kʷ, *gʷ, *ŋʷ are derived from alveolar or velar consonants preceding high back or high front vowels.
*/ɗ/ is likely derived from *l.

Proto-Kru vowels (Marchese Zogbo 2012):
There is a clear bipartite division between Western and Eastern Kru marked by phonological and lexical distinctions. Some isoglosses between Western Kru and Eastern Kru:

<doc id="54712" wikidata="Q1140549" url="?curid=54712" title="Abdominal obesity">
<text>Abdominal obesity, also known as central obesity and truncal obesity, is the human condition of an excessive concentration of visceral fat around the stomach and abdomen to such an extent that it is likely to harm its bearer&#x27;s health. Abdominal obesity has been strongly linked to cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, and other metabolic and vascular diseases.

Visceral fat, central abdominal fat, and waist circumference show a strong association with type 2 diabetes.

Visceral fat, also known as organ fat or &quot;intra-abdominal fat&quot;, is located inside the peritoneal cavity, packed in between internal organs and torso, as opposed to subcutaneous fat, which is found underneath the skin, and intramuscular fat, which is found interspersed in skeletal muscle. Visceral fat is composed of several adipose depots including mesenteric, epididymal white adipose tissue (EWAT), and perirenal fat. An excess of adipose visceral fat is known as central obesity, the &quot;pot belly&quot; or &quot;beer belly&quot; effect, in which the abdomen protrudes excessively. This body type is also known as &quot;apple shaped&quot;, as opposed to &quot;pear shaped&quot; in which fat is deposited on the hips and buttocks.

Researchers first started to focus on abdominal obesity in the 1980s when they realized it had an important connection to cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. Abdominal obesity was more closely related with metabolic dysfunctions connected with cardiovascular disease than was general obesity. In the late 1980s and early 1990s insightful and powerful imaging techniques were discovered that would further help advance the understanding of the health risks associated with body fat accumulation. Techniques such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging made it possible to categorize mass of adipose tissue located at the abdominal level into intra-abdominal fat and subcutaneous fat.

Abdominal obesity is linked with higher cardiovascular events among South Asian ethnic population.

== Health risks ==
===Heart disease===
Abdominal obesity is typically associated with a statistically higher risk of heart disease, hypertension, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes (see below). With an increase in the waist to hip ratio and overall waist circumference the risk of death increases as well. Metabolic syndrome is associated with abdominal obesity, blood lipid disorders, inflammation, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease. It is now generally believed that intra-abdominal fat is the depot that conveys the biggest health risk.

Recent validation has concluded that total and regional body volume estimates correlate positively and significantly with biomarkers of cardiovascular risk and that BVI calculations correlate significantly with all biomarkers of cardiovascular risk.

=== Diabetes ===
There are numerous theories as to the exact cause and mechanism in type 2 diabetes. Central obesity is known to predispose individuals for insulin resistance. Abdominal fat is especially active hormonally, secreting a group of hormones called adipokines that may possibly impair glucose tolerance. But adiponectin, an anti-inflammatory adipokine, which is found in lower concentration in obese and diabetic individuals has shown to be beneficial and protective in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

Insulin resistance is a major feature of diabetes mellitus type 2, and central obesity is correlated with both insulin resistance and T2DM itself. Increased adiposity (obesity) raises serum resistin levels, which in turn directly correlate to insulin resistance. Studies have also confirmed a direct correlation between resistin levels and T2DM. And it is waistline adipose tissue (central obesity) which seems to be the foremost type of fat deposits contributing to rising levels of serum resistin. Conversely, serum resistin levels have been found to &quot;decline&quot; with decreased adiposity following medical treatment.

=== Asthma ===

Developing asthma due to abdominal obesity is also a main concern. As a result of breathing at low lung volume, the muscles are tighter and the airway is narrower. Obesity causes decreased tidal volumes due to a reduction in chest expansion that is caused both by the weight on the chest itself and the effect of abdominal obesity on flattening the diaphragm. It is commonly seen that people who are obese breathe quickly and often, while inhaling small volumes of air. People with obesity are also more likely to be hospitalized for asthma. A study has stated that 75% of patients treated for asthma in the emergency room were either overweight or obese.

=== Alzheimer&#x27;s disease ===
Based on studies, it is evident that obesity has a strong association with vascular and metabolic disease which could potentially be linked to Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Recent studies have also shown an association between mid-life obesity and dementia, but the relationship between later life obesity and dementia is less clear. A study by Debette et al. (2010) examining over 700 adults found evidence to suggest higher volumes of visceral fat, regardless of overall weight, were associated with smaller brain volumes and increased risk of dementia. Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and abdominal obesity has a strong correlation and with metabolic factors added in, the risk of developing Alzheimer&#x27;s disease was even higher. Based on logistic regression analyses, it was found that obesity was associated with an almost 10-fold increase risk of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

===Other health risks===

Central obesity can be a feature of lipodystrophies, a group of diseases that is either inherited, or due to secondary causes (often protease inhibitors, a group of medications against AIDS). Central obesity is a symptom of Cushing&#x27;s syndrome and is also common in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Central obesity is associated with glucose intolerance and dyslipidemia. Once dyslipidemia becomes a severe problem, an individual&#x27;s abdominal cavity would generate elevated free fatty acid flux to the liver. The effect of abdominal adiposity occurs not just in those who are obese, but also affects people who are non-obese and it also contributes to insulin sensitivity.

Ghroubi et al. (2007) examined whether abdominal circumference is a more reliable indicator than BMI or the presence of knee osteoarthritis in obese patients. They found that it actually appears to be a factor linked with the presence of knee pain as well as osteoarthritis in obese study subjects. Ghroubi et al. (2007) concluded that a high abdominal circumference is associated with great functional repercussion.

Research published in The Lancet (2023) found that high levels of visceral fat were related to poorer cognitive performance. The findings suggest that maintaining a healthy weight and metabolic health may be important for preserving cognitive function.

== Causes ==

===Diet===
The currently prevalent belief is that the immediate cause of obesity is net energy imbalance—the organism consumes more usable calories than it expends, wastes, or discards through elimination. Some studies indicate that visceral adiposity, together with lipid dysregulation and decreased insulin sensitivity, is related to the excessive consumption of fructose. Some evidence shows that in regards to juveniles, when free fructose is present as children&#x27;s fat cells mature, it makes more of these cells mature into fat cells in the abdominal region. It also caused both visceral fat and subcutaneous fat to be less sensitive to insulin. These effects were not attenuated when compared to similar glucose consumption.

Intake of trans fat from industrial oils has been associated with increased abdominal obesity in men and increased weight and waist circumference in women. These associations were not attenuated when fat intake and calorie intake was accounted for. Greater meat (processed meat, red meat, and poultry) consumption has also been positively associated with greater weight gain, and specifically abdominal obesity, even when accounting for calories. Conversely, studies suggest that oily fish consumption is negatively associated with total body fat and abdominal fat distribution even when body mass remains constant. Similarly, increased soy protein consumption is correlated with lower amounts of abdominal fat in postmenopausal women even when calorie consumption is controlled.

Numerous large studies have demonstrated that ultra-processed foods have a positive dose-dependent relationship with both abdominal obesity and general obesity in both men and women. Consuming a diet rich in unprocessed food and minimally processed food is linked with lower obesity risk, lower waist circumference and less chronic disease. These findings are consistent among American, Canadian, Latin American, Australian, British, French, Spaniard, Swedish, South Korean, Chinese and Sub-Saharan African populations.

Obesity plays an important role in the impairment of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism shown in high-carbohydrate diets. It has also been shown that quality protein intake during a 24-hour period and the number of times the essential amino acid threshold of approximately 10 g has been achieved is inversely related to the percentage of central abdominal fat. Quality protein uptake is defined as the ratio of essential amino acids to daily dietary protein.

Visceral fat cells will release their metabolic by-products in the portal circulation, where the blood leads straight to the liver. Thus, the excess of triglycerides and fatty acids created by the visceral fat cells will go into the liver and accumulate there. In the liver, most of it will be stored as fat. This concept is known as &#x27;lipotoxicity&#x27;.

=== Alcohol consumption ===
A study has shown that alcohol consumption is directly associated with waist circumference and with a higher risk of abdominal obesity in men, but not in women. After controlling for energy under-reporting, which have slightly attenuated these associations, it was observed that increasing alcohol consumption significantly increased the risk of exceeding recommended energy intakes in male participants – but not in the small number of female participants (2.13%) with elevated alcohol consumption, even after establishing a lower number of drinks per day to characterize women as consuming a high quantity of alcohol. Further research is needed to determine whether a significant relationship between alcohol consumption and abdominal obesity exists among women who consume higher amounts of alcohol.

A systemic review and meta-analysis failed to find data pointing towards a dose-dependent relationship between beer intake and general obesity or abdominal obesity at low or moderate intake levels (under ~500 mL/day). However, high beer intake (above ~4 L/wk) appeared to be associated with a higher degree of abdominal obesity specifically, particularly among men.

===Other factors===
The prevalence of abdominal obesity is increasing in Western populations, possibly due to a combination of low physical activity and high-calorie diets, and also in developing countries, where it is associated with the urbanization of populations.

Other environmental factors, such as maternal smoking, estrogenic compounds in the diet, and endocrine-disrupting chemicals may be important also.

Hypercortisolism, such as in Cushing&#x27;s syndrome, also leads to central obesity. Many prescription drugs, such as dexamethasone and other steroids, can also have side effects resulting in central obesity, especially in the presence of elevated insulin levels.

== Diagnosis ==

There are various ways of measuring abdominal obesity including:
*Absolute waist circumference (&gt; in men and &gt; in women)
*Waist–hip ratio (the circumference of the waist divided by that of the hips of &gt;0.9 for men and &gt;0.85 for women)
*Waist-stature ratio (waist circumference divided by their height, &gt;0.5 for adults under 40 and &gt;0.6 for adults over 50)
*Sagittal Abdominal Diameter
In those with a body mass index (BMI) under 35, intra-abdominal body fat is related to negative health outcomes independent of total body fat. Intra-abdominal or visceral fat has a particularly strong correlation with cardiovascular disease.

BMI and waist measurements are well recognized ways to characterize obesity. However, waist measurements are not as accurate as BMI measurements. Waist measurement (&quot;e.g.&quot;, for BFP standard) is more prone to errors than measuring height and weight (&quot;e.g.&quot;, for BMI standard). BMI will illustrate the best estimate of one&#x27;s total body fatness, while waist measurement gives an estimate of visceral fat and risk of obesity-related disease. It is recommended to use both methods of measurements.

While central obesity can be obvious just by looking at the naked body (see the picture), the severity of central obesity is determined by taking waist and hip measurements. The absolute waist circumference in men and in women and the waist–hip ratio (&gt;0.9 for men and &gt;0.85 for women) are both used as measures of central obesity. A differential diagnosis includes distinguishing central obesity from ascites and intestinal bloating. In the cohort of 15,000 people participating in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), waist circumference explained obesity-related health risk better than BMI when metabolic syndrome was taken as an outcome measure and this difference was statistically significant. In other words, excessive waist circumference appears to be more of a risk factor for metabolic syndrome than BMI. Another measure of central obesity which has shown superiority to BMI in predicting cardiovascular disease risk is the Index of Central Obesity (waist-to-height ratio, WHtR), where a ratio of &gt;=0.5 (i.e. a waist circumference at least half of the individual&#x27;s height) is predictive of increased risk.
Another diagnosis of obesity is the analysis of intra-abdominal fat having the most risk to one&#x27;s personal health. The increased amount of fat in this region relates to the higher levels of plasma lipid and lipoproteins as per studies mentioned by Eric Poehlman (1998) review.
An increasing acceptance of the importance of central obesity within the medical profession as an indicator of health risk has led to new developments in obesity diagnosis such as the Body Volume Index, which measures central obesity by measuring a person&#x27;s body shape and their weight distribution. The effect of abdominal adiposity occurs not just in those who are obese, but also affects people who are non-obese and it also contributes to insulin sensitivity.

=== Index of central obesity ===
Index of Central Obesity (ICO) is the ratio of waist circumference and height first proposed by a Parikh &quot;et al.&quot; in 2007 as a better substitute to the widely used waist circumference in defining metabolic syndrome. The National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III suggested cutoff of and for males and females as a marker of central obesity. The same was used in defining metabolic syndrome. Misra et al. suggested that these cutoffs are not applicable among Indians and the cutoffs be lowered to and for males and females. Various race specific cutoffs were suggested by different groups. The International Diabetes Federation defined central obesity based on these various race and gender specific cutoffs. The other limitation of waist circumference is that it the measurement procedure has not been standardized and in children there are no, or few, comparison standards or reference data.

Parikh et al. looked at the average heights of various races and suggested that by using ICO various race- and gender-specific cutoffs of waist circumference can be discarded. An ICO cutoff of 0.53 was suggested as a criterion to define central obesity. Parikh &quot;et al.&quot; further tested a modified definition of metabolic syndrome in which waist circumference was replaced with ICO in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database and found the modified definition to be more specific and sensitive.

This parameter has been used in the study of metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease.

Central obesity in individuals with normal BMI is referred to as normal weight obesity.

=== Sex differences ===
There are sex-dependent differences in regional fat distribution.

Males are more susceptible to upper-body fat accumulation, most likely in the belly, due to sex hormone differences. When comparing the body fat of men and women it is seen that men have close to twice the visceral fat as that of pre-menopausal women.

In women, estrogen is believed to cause fat to be stored in the buttocks, thighs, and hips. When women reach menopause and the estrogen produced by ovaries declines, fat at their buttocks, hips, and thighs decreases while fat at their belly increases.

50% of men and 70% of women in the United States between the ages of 50 and 79 years now exceed the waist circumference threshold for central obesity.

Central obesity is positively associated with coronary heart disease risk in women and men. It has been hypothesized that the sex differences in fat distribution may explain the sex difference in coronary heart disease risk. Even with the differences, at any given level of central obesity measured as waist circumference or waist to hip ratio, coronary artery disease rates are identical in men and women.

A permanent routine of exercise, eating healthily, and, during periods of being overweight, consuming the same number or fewer calories than used will prevent and help fight obesity. A single pound of fat yields approximately 3500 calories of energy (32 000 kJ energy per kilogram of fat), and weight loss is achieved by reducing energy intake, or increasing energy expenditure, thus achieving a negative balance. Adjunctive therapies which may be prescribed by a physician are orlistat or sibutramine, although the latter has been associated with increased cardiovascular events and strokes and has been withdrawn from the market in the US, the UK, the EU, Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, and Thailand.

A 2006 study published in the &quot;International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism&quot; suggests that combining cardiovascular (aerobic) exercise with resistance training is more effective than cardiovascular training alone in getting rid of abdominal fat. An additional benefit to exercising is that it reduces stress and insulin levels, which reduce the presence of cortisol, a hormone that leads to more belly fat deposits and leptin resistance.

Self-motivation by understanding the risks associated with abdominal obesity is widely regarded as being far more important than worries about cosmetics. In addition, understanding the health issues linked with abdominal obesity can help in the self-motivation process of losing the abdominal fat. As mentioned above, abdominal fat is linked with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer. Specifically it is the deepest layer of belly fat (the fat that cannot be seen or grabbed) that poses health risks, as these &quot;visceral&quot; fat cells produce hormones that can affect health (e.g. increased insulin resistance and/or breast cancer risk). The risk increases considering the fact that they are located in the proximity or in between organs in the abdominal cavity. For example, fat next to the liver drains into it, causing a fatty liver, which is a risk factor for insulin resistance, setting the stage for type 2 diabetes. However, visceral fat is more responsive to the circulation of catecholamines.

In the presence of type 2 diabetes, the physician might instead prescribe metformin and thiazolidinediones (rosiglitazone or pioglitazone) as antidiabetic drugs rather than sulfonylurea derivatives. Thiazolidinediones may cause slight weight gain but decrease &quot;pathologic&quot; abdominal fat (visceral fat), and therefore may be prescribed for diabetics with central obesity.
Thiazolidinedione has been associated with heart failure and increased cardiovascular risk; so it has been withdrawn from the market in Europe by EMA in 2010.

Low-fat diets may not be an effective long-term intervention for obesity: as Bacon and Aphramor wrote, &quot;The majority of individuals regain virtually all of the weight that was lost during treatment.&quot; The Women&#x27;s Health Initiative (&quot;the largest and longest randomized, controlled dietary intervention clinical trial&quot;) found that long-term dietary intervention increased the waist circumference of both the intervention group and the control group, though the increase was smaller for the intervention group. The conclusion was that mean weight decreased significantly in the intervention group from baseline to year 1 by 2.2 kg (P&lt;.001) and was 2.2 kg less than the control group change from baseline at year 1. This difference from baseline between control and intervention groups diminished over time, but a significant difference in weight was maintained through year 9, the end of the study.

==Society and culture==

=== Myths ===
There is a common misconception that spot exercise (that is, exercising a specific muscle or location of the body) most effectively burns fat at the desired location, but this is not the case. Spot exercise is beneficial for building specific muscles, but it has little effect, if any, on fat in that area of the body, or on the body&#x27;s distribution of body fat. The same logic applies to sit-ups and belly fat. Sit-ups, crunches and other abdominal exercises are useful in building the abdominal muscles, but they have little effect, if any, on the adipose tissue located there.

=== Colloquialisms ===
A large central adiposity deposit has been assigned many common use names, including &quot;spare tire&quot;, &quot;love handle&quot;, &quot;paunch&quot;, &quot;boiler&quot;, and &quot;potbelly&quot;. Several colloquial terms used to refer to central obesity, and to people who have it, refer to beer drinking. However, there is little scientific evidence that beer drinkers are more prone to central obesity, despite its being known colloquially as &quot;beer belly&quot;, &quot;beer gut&quot;, or &quot;beer pot&quot;. One of the few studies conducted on the subject did not find that beer drinkers are more prone to central obesity than nondrinkers or drinkers of wine or spirits. Chronic alcoholism can lead to cirrhosis, symptoms of which include gynecomastia (enlarged breasts) and ascites (abdominal fluid). These symptoms can suggest the appearance of central obesity.

=== Economics ===
Researchers in Copenhagen examined the relationship between waist circumferences and costs among 31,840 subjects aged 50–64 years of age with different waist circumferences. Their study showed that an increase in just an additional centimetre above normal waistline caused a 1.25% and 2.08% rise in health care costs in women and men respectively. To put this in perspective, a woman with a waistline of 95 cm (approx 37.4 in) and without underlying health problems or co-morbidities can incur economic costs that are 22%, or US$397, higher per year than a woman with a normal waist circumference.

<text>The Natufian culture ( ) is a Late Epipaleolithic archaeological culture of the prehistoric Levant in Western Asia, dating to around 15,000 to 11,500 years ago. The culture was unusual in that it supported a sedentary or semi-sedentary population even before the introduction of agriculture. Natufian communities may be the ancestors of the builders of the first Neolithic settlements of the region, which may have been the earliest in the world. Some evidence suggests deliberate cultivation of cereals, specifically rye, by the Natufian culture at Tell Abu Hureyra, the site of the earliest evidence of agriculture in the world. The world&#x27;s oldest known evidence of the production of bread-like foodstuff has been found at Shubayqa 1, a 14,400-year-old site in Jordan&#x27;s northeastern desert, 4,000 years before the emergence of agriculture in Southwest Asia. In addition, the oldest known evidence of possible beer-brewing, dating to approximately 13,000 BP, was found in Raqefet Cave on Mount Carmel, although the beer-related residues may simply be a result of a spontaneous fermentation.

Generally, though, Natufians exploited wild cereals and hunted animals, notably gazelles. Archaeogenetic analysis has revealed derivation of later (Neolithic to Bronze Age) Levantines primarily from Natufians, along with substantial later gene flow from Anatolia.

Dorothy Garrod coined the term Natufian based on her excavations at the Shuqba cave (Wadi an-Natuf) near the town of Shuqba.

== Discovery ==

The Natufian culture was discovered by British archaeologist Dorothy Garrod during her excavations of Shuqba cave in the Judaean Hills, on the West Bank of the Jordan River. Prior to the 1930s, the majority of archaeological work taking place in British Palestine was biblical archaeology focused on historic periods, and little was known about the region&#x27;s prehistory.

In 1928, Garrod was invited by the British School of Archaeology in Jerusalem (BSAJ) to excavate Shuqba cave, where prehistoric stone tools had been discovered by Père Mallon four years earlier. She discovered a layer sandwiched between the Upper Palaeolithic and Bronze Age deposits characterised by the presence of microliths. She identified this with the Mesolithic, a transitional period between the Palaeolithic and the Neolithic which was well-represented in Europe but had not yet been found in the Near East. A year later, when she discovered similar material at el-Wad Terrace, Garrod suggested the name &quot;the Natufian culture&quot;, after Wadi an-Natuf that ran close to Shuqba.

Over the next two decades Garrod found Natufian material at several of her pioneering excavations in the Mount Carmel region, including el-Wad, Kebara and Tabun, as did the French archaeologist René Neuville, firmly establishing the Natufian culture in the regional prehistoric chronology. As early as 1931, both Garrod and Neuville drew attention to the presence of stone sickles in Natufian assemblages and the possibility that this represented a very early agriculture.

==Dating==


Radiocarbon dating places the Natufian culture at an epoch from the terminal Pleistocene to the very beginning of the Holocene, a time period between 12,500 and 9,500 BC.

The period is commonly split into two subperiods: Early Natufian (12,000–10,800 BC) and Late Natufian (10,800–9,500 BC). The Late Natufian most likely occurred in tandem with the Younger Dryas (10,800 to 9,500 BC). The Levant hosts more than a hundred kinds of cereals, fruits, nuts, and other edible parts of plants, and the flora of the Levant during the Natufian period was not the dry, barren, and thorny landscape of today, but rather woodland.

==Precursors and associated cultures==
The Natufian developed in the same region as the earlier Kebaran culture. It is generally seen as a successor, which evolved out of elements within that preceding culture. There were also other industries in the region, such as the Mushabian culture of the Negev and the Sinai Peninsula, which are sometimes distinguished from the Kebaran culture or believed to have been involved in the evolution of the Natufian culture.

More generally there has been discussion of the similarities of these cultures with those found in coastal North Africa. Graeme Barker notes there are: &quot;similarities in the respective archaeological records of the Natufian culture of the Levant and of contemporary foragers in coastal North Africa across the late Pleistocene and early Holocene boundary&quot;. According to Isabelle De Groote and Louise Humphrey, Natufians practiced the Iberomaurusian and Capsian custom of sometimes extracting their maxillary central incisors (upper front teeth).
Ofer Bar-Yosef has argued that there are signs of influences coming from North Africa to the Levant, citing the microburin technique and &quot;microlithic forms such as arched backed bladelets and La Mouillah points.&quot; But recent research has shown that the presence of arched backed bladelets, La Mouillah points, and the use of the microburin technique was already apparent in the Nebekian industry of the Eastern Levant. And Maher et al. state that, &quot;Many technological nuances that have often been always highlighted as significant during the Natufian were already present during the Early and Middle EP [Epipalaeolithic] and do not, in most cases, represent a radical departure in knowledge, tradition, or behavior.&quot;

Authors such as Christopher Ehret have built upon the little evidence available to develop scenarios of intensive usage of plants having built up first in North Africa, as a precursor to the development of true farming in the Fertile Crescent, but such suggestions are considered highly speculative until more North African archaeological evidence can be gathered. In fact, Weiss et al. have shown that the earliest known intensive usage of plants was in the Levant 23,000 years ago at the Ohalo II site.

Anthropologist C. Loring Brace (1993) cross-analysed the craniometric traits of Natufian specimens with those of various ancient and modern groups from the Near East, Africa and Europe. The Late Pleistocene Epipalaeolithic Natufian sample was described as problematic due to its small size (consisting of only three males and one female), as well as the lack of a comparative sample from the Natufians&#x27; putative descendants in the Neolithic Near East. Brace observed that the Natufian fossils lay between those of the Niger–Congo-speaking series included and the other samples (Near East, Europe), which he suggested may point to a Sub-Saharan influence in their constitution. Subsequent ancient DNA analysis of Natufian skeletal remains by Lazaridis et al. (2016) found that the specimens instead were a mix of 50% Basal Eurasian ancestral component (see Archaeogenetics) and 50% West-Eurasian Unknown Hunter Gatherer (UHG) population related to European Western Hunter-Gatherers.

Natufians have also been described by anthropologists as a Proto-Mediterranean population.

According to Bar-Yosef and Belfer-Cohen, &quot;It seems that certain preadaptive traits, developed already by the Kebaran and Geometric Kebaran populations within the Mediterranean park forest, played an important role in the emergence of the new socioeconomic system known as the Natufian culture.&quot;

==Settlements==

Settlements occur mostly in Israel and Palestine. This could be deemed the core zone of the Natufian culture, but Israel is a place that has been excavated more frequently than other places hence the greater number of sites. During the years more sites have been found outside the core zone of Israel and Palestine stretching into what now is Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, the Sinai Peninsula and the Negev desert. The settlements in the Natufian culture were larger and more permanent than in preceding ones. Some Natufian sites had stone built architecture; Ain Mallaha is an example of round stone structures. Cave sites are also seen frequently during the Natufian culture. El Wad is a Natufian cave site with occupation in the front part of the cave also called the terrace. Some Natufian sites were located in forest/steppe areas and others near inland mountains. The Natufian settlements appear to be the first to exhibit evidence of food storage; not all Natufian sites have storage facilities, but they have been identified at certain sites. Natufians are also suggested to have visited Cyprus, requiring travel over significant distances of water.

== Material culture ==
===Lithics===
The Natufian had a microlithic industry centered on short blades and bladelets. The microburin technique was used. Geometric microliths include lunates, trapezes, and triangles. There are backed blades as well. A special type of retouch (Helwan retouch) is characteristic for the early Natufian. In the late Natufian, the Harif-point, a typical arrowhead made from a regular blade, became common in the Negev. Some scholars use it to define a separate culture, the Harifian.

Sickle blades also appear for the first time in the Natufian lithic industry. The characteristic sickle-gloss shows that they were used to cut the silica-rich stems of cereals, indirectly suggesting the existence of incipient agriculture. Shaft straighteners made of ground stone indicate the practice of archery. There are heavy ground-stone bowl mortars as well.

=== Art ===
The &quot;Ain Sakhri lovers&quot;, a carved stone object held at the British Museum, is the oldest known depiction of a couple having sex. It was found in the Ain Sakhri cave in the Judean desert.

===Burials===

Natufian grave goods are typically made of shell, teeth (of red deer), bones, and stone. There are pendants, bracelets, necklaces, earrings, and belt-ornaments as well.
In 2008, the 12,400–12,000 cal BC grave of an apparently significant Natufian female was discovered in a ceremonial pit in the Hilazon Tachtit cave in northern Israel. Media reports referred to this person as a &quot;shaman&quot;. The burial contained the remains of at least three aurochs and 86 tortoises, all of which are thought to have been brought to the site during a funeral feast. The body was surrounded by tortoise shells, the pelvis of a leopard, forearm of a boar, a wingtip of a golden eagle, and skull of a beech marten.

=== Long-distance exchange ===
At Ain Mallaha (in Northern Israel), Anatolian obsidian and shellfish from the Nile valley have been found. The source of malachite beads is still unknown. Epipaleolithic Natufians carried parthenocarpic figs from Africa to the southeastern corner of the Fertile Crescent, .

===Other finds===
There was a rich bone industry, including harpoons and fish hooks. Stone and bone were worked into pendants and other ornaments. There are a few human figurines made of limestone (El-Wad, Ain Mallaha, Ain Sakhri), but the favorite subject of representative art seems to have been animals. Ostrich-shell containers have been found in the Negev.

In 2018, the world&#x27;s oldest brewery was found, with the residue of 13,000-year-old beer, in a prehistoric cave near Haifa in Israel when researchers were looking for clues into what plant foods the Natufian people were eating. This is 8,000 years earlier than experts previously thought beer was invented.

A study published in 2019 shows an advanced knowledge of lime plaster production at a Natufian cemetery in Nahal Ein Gev II site in the Upper Jordan Valley dated to 12 thousand (calibrated) years before present [k cal BP]. Production of plaster of this quality was previously thought to have been achieved some 2,000 years later.

==Subsistence==
The Natufian people lived by hunting and gathering. The preservation of plant remains is poor because of the soil conditions, but at some sites such as Tell Abu Hureyra substantial amounts of plant remains discovered through flotation have been excavated. However wild cereals like legumes, almonds, acorns and pistachios have been collected throughout most of the Levant. Animal bones show that mountain and goitered gazelles (&quot;Gazella gazella&quot; and &quot;Gazella subgutturosa&quot;) were the main prey.

Additionally, deer, aurochs and wild boar were hunted in the steppe, as well as onagers and caprids (ibex). Waterfowl and freshwater fish formed part of the diet in the Jordan river valley. Animal bones from Salibiya I (12,300 – 10,800 cal BP) have been interpreted as evidence for communal hunts with nets, however, the radiocarbon dates are far too old compared to the cultural remains of this settlement, indicating contamination of the samples.

===Development of agriculture===
A pita-like bread has been found from 12,500 BC attributed to Natufians. This bread is made of wild cereal seeds and papyrus cousin tubers, ground into flour.

According to one theory, it was a sudden change in climate, the Younger Dryas event ( to 9500 BC), which inspired the development of agriculture. The Younger Dryas was a 1,000-year-long interruption in the higher temperatures prevailing since the Last Glacial Maximum, which produced a sudden drought in the Levant. This would have endangered the wild cereals, which could no longer compete with dryland scrub, but upon which the population had become dependent to sustain a relatively large sedentary population. By artificially clearing scrub and planting seeds obtained from elsewhere, they began to practice agriculture. However, this theory of the origin of agriculture is controversial in the scientific community.

===Domesticated dog===

At the Natufian site of Ain Mallaha in Israel, dated to 12,000 BC, the remains of an elderly human and a four-to-five-month-old puppy were found buried together. At another Natufian site at the cave of Hayonim, humans were found buried with two canids.

==Archaeogenetics==

Ancient DNA analysis of Natufian skeletal remains found that the Natufian ancestry could be modelled as a mix of about 50% Basal Eurasian ancestry, and 50% from a West-Eurasian Unknown Hunter Gatherer (UHG) population, which was related to European Western Hunter-Gatherers. Vallini et al. (2024) modeled the amount of Basal Eurasian ancestry among Natufians at roughly 15%, with the remainder being associated with West Eurasian sources.

The Natufian population also displays ancestral ties to Paleolithic Taforalt samples, the makers of the Epipaleolithic Iberomaurusian culture of the Maghreb, the Pre-Pottery Neolithic culture of the Levant, the Early Neolithic Ifri N&#x27;Amr Ou Moussa and the Late Neolithic Kelif el Boroud culture of North Africa, with samples associated with these early cultures all sharing a common genomic component dubbed the &quot;Natufian component&quot;, which diverged from other West Eurasian lineages ~26,000 years ago, and is most closely linked to the Arabian lineage. Possible bidirectional geneflow events between these groups has also been suggested, with particular evidence for affinity between the Natufians and Iberomaurusians.

Contact between Natufians and other Neolithic Levantines, Caucasus hunter-gatherers (CHG), Anatolian and Iranian farmers is believed to have decreased genetic variability among later populations in the Middle East. Migrations from the Near-East also occurred towards Africa, and the West Eurasian-like ancestry among populations in the Horn of Africa being best represented by the Levant Neolithic, and may be associated with the spread of Afroasiatic languages.
Lazaridis et al. (2016) did not find a greater genetic affinity between Natufians and sub-Saharan Africans than that existing between sub-Saharan Africans and other ancient populations of Western Eurasia, and also stated that the ancestry of a primitive population from North Africa could not be tested because modern North Africans are largely descended from late migrant populations from Eurasia. However, Daniel Shriner (2018), using modern populations as a reference, found 28% autosomal African ancestry in Natufian samples, with 21.2% related to North Africa and 6.8% related to Omotic-speaking populations in southern Ethiopia, which reveals a plausible source for haplogroup E in Natufians; still according to Shriner, the Natufian samples had 61.2% ancestry related to Arabs and 10.8% ancestry related to West Asians. 

As summarized by Rosa Fregel, a later preprint from Lazaridis et al. (2018) has contested Loosdrecht&#x27;s conclusion and argues for a minor sub-Saharan African component in Natufians, stating &quot;that [the Iberomaurusians of] Taforalt can be better modeled as a mixture of a Dzudzuana component and a sub-Saharan African component&quot; (or an ancient and now-extinct North African component that diverged prior to the Out-of-Africa migration) and &quot;also argue that (...) the Taforalt people (...) contributed to the genetic composition of Natufians and not the other way around&quot;, , which, according to Lazaridis et al., would be consistent with morphological and archaeological studies that indicate a dissemination of morphological characteristics and artifacts from North Africa to the Near East, as well as explaining the presence of Y-chromosome haplogroup E in Natufians and Levantine farmers. Fregel summarizes that &quot;More evidence will be needed to determine the specific origin of the North African Upper Paleolithic populations&quot;.

In their 2017 paper, Ranajit Das, Paul Wexler, Mehdi Pirooznia and Eran Elhaik analyzed the Lazaridis et al. (2016) study concluding that the Natufians, together with one Neolithic Levantine sample, clustered in the proximity to modern Palestinians and Bedouins, and also &quot;marginally overlapped&quot; with Yemenite Jews. Ferreira et al. (2021) and Almarri et al. (2021) found that ancient Natufians cluster with modern Arabian groups, such as Saudi Arabians and Yemenis, which derive most of their ancestry from local Natufian-like hunter-gatherer peoples and have less Neolithic Anatolian ancestry than Levantines. Sirak et al. (2024) found that medieval Socotra (the Soqotri people), similar to modern Saudis, Yemenis and Bedouins, have a majority component that is &quot;maximized in Late Pleistocene (Epipaleolithic) Natufian hunter–gatherers from the Levant&quot;.

==Language==
Alexander Militarev, Vitaly Shevoroshkin and others have linked the Natufian culture to the proto-Afroasiatic language, which they in turn believe has a Levantine origin. Some scholars, for example Christopher Ehret, Roger Blench and others, contend that the Afroasiatic Urheimat is to be found in North Africa or Northeast Africa, probably in the area of Egypt, the Sahara, Horn of Africa or Sudan. Within this group, Ehret, who like Militarev believes Afroasiatic may already have been in existence in the Natufian period, would associate Natufians only with the Near Eastern Proto-Semitic branch of Afroasiatic.

John Bengston documented that archeological and physical anthropological evidence showed Natufians are closely related to modern Semitic-speaking people from the Levant. Under his hypothesis, Afro-Asiatic branches originated in North Africa proper (Egypt), and the age of these languages can be dated to the periods of the Natufian culture around ~12,000 years ago. He postulated this based on the biological discontinuity between Pleistocene and Holocene North Africa, where there was population replacement and admixture in this region involving external migrants from northern areas, who were the ancestral Afro-Asiatic speakers.

<doc id="54717" wikidata="Q899444" url="?curid=54717" title="De Broglie–Bohm theory">
<text>The de Broglie–Bohm theory is an interpretation of quantum mechanics which postulates that, in addition to the wavefunction, an actual configuration of particles exists, even when unobserved. The evolution over time of the configuration of all particles is defined by a guiding equation. The evolution of the wave function over time is given by the Schrödinger equation. The theory is named after Louis de Broglie (1892–1987) and David Bohm (1917–1992).

The theory is deterministic and explicitly nonlocal: the velocity of any one particle depends on the value of the guiding equation, which depends on the configuration of all the particles under consideration.

Measurements are a particular case of quantum processes described by the theory—for which it yields the same quantum predictions as other interpretations of quantum mechanics. The theory does not have a &quot;measurement problem&quot;, due to the fact that the particles have a definite configuration at all times. The Born rule in de Broglie–Bohm theory is not a postulate. Rather, in this theory, the link between the probability density and the wave function has the status of a theorem, a result of a separate postulate, the &quot;quantum equilibrium hypothesis&quot;, which is additional to the basic principles governing the wave function.
There are several equivalent mathematical formulations of the theory.

== Overview ==
De Broglie–Bohm theory is based on the following postulates:
* There is a configuration formula_1 of the universe, described by coordinates formula_2, which is an element of the configuration space formula_3. The configuration space is different for different versions of pilot-wave theory. For example, this may be the space of positions formula_4 of formula_5 particles, or, in case of field theory, the space of field configurations formula_6. The configuration evolves (for spin=0) according to the guiding equation formula_7 where formula_8 is the probability current or probability flux, and formula_9 is the momentum operator. Here, formula_10 is the standard complex-valued wavefunction from quantum theory, which evolves according to Schrödinger&#x27;s equation formula_11This completes the specification of the theory for any quantum theory with Hamilton operator of type formula_12.
* The configuration is distributed according to formula_13 at some moment of time formula_14, and this consequently holds for all times. Such a state is named quantum equilibrium. With quantum equilibrium, this theory agrees with the results of standard quantum mechanics.

Even though this latter relation is frequently presented as an axiom of the theory, Bohm presented it as derivable from statistical-mechanical arguments in the original papers of 1952. This argument was further supported by the work of Bohm in 1953 and was substantiated by Vigier and Bohm&#x27;s paper of 1954, in which they introduced stochastic &quot;fluid fluctuations&quot; that drive a process of asymptotic relaxation from quantum non-equilibrium to quantum equilibrium (ρ → |ψ|2).

=== Double-slit experiment ===
The double-slit experiment is an illustration of wave–particle duality. In it, a beam of particles (such as electrons) travels through a barrier that has two slits. If a detector screen is on the side beyond the barrier, the pattern of detected particles shows interference fringes characteristic of waves arriving at the screen from two sources (the two slits); however, the interference pattern is made up of individual dots corresponding to particles that had arrived on the screen. The system seems to exhibit the behaviour of both waves (interference patterns) and particles (dots on the screen).

If this experiment is modified so that one slit is closed, no interference pattern is observed. Thus, the state of both slits affects the final results. It can also be arranged to have a minimally invasive detector at one of the slits to detect which slit the particle went through. When that is done, the interference pattern disappears.

In de Broglie–Bohm theory, the wavefunction is defined at both slits, but each particle has a well-defined trajectory that passes through exactly one of the slits. The final position of the particle on the detector screen and the slit through which the particle passes is determined by the initial position of the particle. Such initial position is not knowable or controllable by the experimenter, so there is an appearance of randomness in the pattern of detection. In Bohm&#x27;s 1952 papers he used the wavefunction to construct a quantum potential that, when included in Newton&#x27;s equations, gave the trajectories of the particles streaming through the two slits. In effect the wavefunction interferes with itself and guides the particles by the quantum potential in such a way that the particles avoid the regions in which the interference is destructive and are attracted to the regions in which the interference is constructive, resulting in the interference pattern on the detector screen.

To explain the behavior when the particle is detected to go through one slit, one needs to appreciate the role of the conditional wavefunction and how it results in the collapse of the wavefunction; this is explained below. The basic idea is that the environment registering the detection effectively separates the two wave packets in configuration space.

== Theory ==

=== Pilot wave ===

The de Broglie–Bohm theory describes a pilot wave formula_15 in a configuration space formula_3 and trajectories formula_17 of particles as in classical mechanics but defined by non-Newtonian mechanics. At every moment of time there exists not only a wavefunction, but also a well-defined configuration of the whole universe (i.e., the system as defined by the boundary conditions used in solving the Schrödinger equation). 

The de Broglie–Bohm theory works on particle positions and trajectories like classical mechanics but the dynamics are different. In classical mechanics, the accelerations of the particles are imparted directly by forces, which exist in physical three-dimensional space. In de Broglie–Bohm theory, the quantum &quot;field exerts a new kind of &quot;quantum-mechanical&quot; force&quot;. Bohm hypothesized that each particle has a &quot;complex and subtle inner structure&quot; that provides the capacity to react to the information provided by the wavefunction by the quantum potential. Also, unlike in classical mechanics, physical properties (e.g., mass, charge) are spread out over the wavefunction in de Broglie–Bohm theory, not localized at the position of the particle.

The wavefunction itself, and not the particles, determines the dynamical evolution of the system: the particles do not act back onto the wave function. As Bohm and Hiley worded it, &quot;the Schrödinger equation for the quantum field does not have sources, nor does it have any other way by which the field could be directly affected by the condition of the particles [...] the quantum theory can be understood completely in terms of the assumption that the quantum field has no sources or other forms of dependence on the particles&quot;. P. Holland considers this lack of reciprocal action of particles and wave function to be one &quot;[a]mong the many nonclassical properties exhibited by this theory&quot;. Holland later called this a merely &quot;apparent&quot; lack of back reaction, due to the incompleteness of the description.

In what follows below, the setup for one particle moving in formula_18 is given followed by the setup for &quot;N&quot; particles moving in 3 dimensions. In the first instance, configuration space and real space are the same, while in the second, real space is still formula_18, but configuration space becomes formula_20. While the particle positions themselves are in real space, the velocity field and wavefunction are on configuration space, which is how particles are entangled with each other in this theory.

Extensions to this theory include spin and more complicated configuration spaces.

We use variations of formula_21 for particle positions, while formula_22 represents the complex-valued wavefunction on configuration space.

=== Guiding equation ===
For a spinless single particle moving in formula_18, the particle&#x27;s velocity is

:formula_24

For many particles labeled formula_4 for the formula_26-th particle their velocities are

:formula_27

The main fact to notice is that this velocity field depends on the actual positions of all of the formula_5 particles in the universe. As explained below, in most experimental situations, the influence of all of those particles can be encapsulated into an effective wavefunction for a subsystem of the universe.

=== Schrödinger&#x27;s equation ===
The one-particle Schrödinger equation governs the time evolution of a complex-valued wavefunction on formula_18. The equation represents a quantized version of the total energy of a classical system evolving under a real-valued potential function formula_30 on formula_18:

:formula_32

For many particles, the equation is the same except that formula_22 and formula_30 are now on configuration space, formula_20:

:formula_36

This is the same wavefunction as in conventional quantum mechanics.

=== Relation to the Born rule ===

In Bohm&#x27;s original papers, he discusses how de Broglie–Bohm theory results in the usual measurement results of quantum mechanics. The main idea is that this is true if the positions of the particles satisfy the statistical distribution given by formula_37. And that distribution is guaranteed to be true for all time by the guiding equation if the initial distribution of the particles satisfies formula_37.

For a given experiment, one can postulate this as being true and verify it experimentally. But, as argued by Dürr et al., one needs to argue that this distribution for subsystems is typical. The authors argue that formula_37, by virtue of its equivariance under the dynamical evolution of the system, is the appropriate measure of typicality for initial conditions of the positions of the particles. The authors then prove that the vast majority of possible initial configurations will give rise to statistics obeying the Born rule (i.e., formula_37) for measurement outcomes. In summary, in a universe governed by the de Broglie–Bohm dynamics, Born rule behavior is typical.

The situation is thus analogous to the situation in classical statistical physics. A low-entropy initial condition will, with overwhelmingly high probability, evolve into a higher-entropy state: behavior consistent with the second law of thermodynamics is typical. There are anomalous initial conditions that would give rise to violations of the second law; however in the absence of some very detailed evidence supporting the realization of one of those conditions, it would be quite unreasonable to expect anything but the actually observed uniform increase of entropy. Similarly in the de Broglie–Bohm theory, there are anomalous initial conditions that would produce measurement statistics in violation of the Born rule (conflicting the predictions of standard quantum theory), but the typicality theorem shows that absent some specific reason to believe one of those special initial conditions was in fact realized, the Born rule behavior is what one should expect.

It is in this qualified sense that the Born rule is, for the de Broglie–Bohm theory, a theorem rather than (as in ordinary quantum theory) an additional postulate.

It can also be shown that a distribution of particles which is &quot;not&quot; distributed according to the Born rule (that is, a distribution &quot;out of quantum equilibrium&quot;) and evolving under the de Broglie–Bohm dynamics is overwhelmingly likely to evolve dynamically into a state distributed as formula_37.

=== The conditional wavefunction of a subsystem ===
In the formulation of the de Broglie–Bohm theory, there is only a wavefunction for the entire universe (which always evolves by the Schrödinger equation). Here, the &quot;universe&quot; is simply the system limited by the same boundary conditions used to solve the Schrödinger equation. However, once the theory is formulated, it is convenient to introduce a notion of wavefunction also for subsystems of the universe. Let us write the wavefunction of the universe as formula_42, where formula_43 denotes the configuration variables associated to some subsystem (I) of the universe, and formula_44 denotes the remaining configuration variables. Denote respectively by formula_45 and formula_46 the actual configuration of subsystem (I) and of the rest of the universe. For simplicity, we consider here only the spinless case. The &quot;conditional wavefunction&quot; of subsystem (I) is defined by

:formula_47

It follows immediately from the fact that formula_48 satisfies the guiding equation that also the configuration formula_45 satisfies a guiding equation identical to the one presented in the formulation of the theory, with the universal wavefunction formula_22 replaced with the conditional wavefunction formula_51. Also, the fact that formula_52 is random with probability density given by the square modulus of formula_53 implies that the conditional probability density of formula_45 given formula_46 is given by the square modulus of the (normalized) conditional wavefunction formula_56 (in the terminology of Dürr et al. this fact is called the &quot;fundamental conditional probability formula&quot;).

Unlike the universal wavefunction, the conditional wavefunction of a subsystem does not always evolve by the Schrödinger equation, but in many situations it does. For instance, if the universal wavefunction factors as

:formula_57

then the conditional wavefunction of subsystem (I) is (up to an irrelevant scalar factor) equal to formula_51 (this is what standard quantum theory would regard as the wavefunction of subsystem (I)). If, in addition, the Hamiltonian does not contain an interaction term between subsystems (I) and (II), then formula_51 does satisfy a Schrödinger equation. More generally, assume that the universal wave function formula_22 can be written in the form

:formula_61

where formula_62 solves Schrödinger equation and, formula_63 for all formula_14 and formula_43. Then, again, the conditional wavefunction of subsystem (I) is (up to an irrelevant scalar factor) equal to formula_51, and if the Hamiltonian does not contain an interaction term between subsystems (I) and (II), then formula_51 satisfies a Schrödinger equation.

The fact that the conditional wavefunction of a subsystem does not always evolve by the Schrödinger equation is related to the fact that the usual collapse rule of standard quantum theory emerges from the Bohmian formalism when one considers conditional wavefunctions of subsystems.

== Extensions ==

=== Relativity ===
Pilot-wave theory is explicitly nonlocal, which is in ostensible conflict with special relativity. Various extensions of &quot;Bohm-like&quot; mechanics exist that attempt to resolve this problem. Bohm himself in 1953 presented an extension of the theory satisfying the Dirac equation for a single particle. However, this was not extensible to the many-particle case because it used an absolute time.

A renewed interest in constructing Lorentz-invariant extensions of Bohmian theory arose in the 1990s; see &quot;Bohm and Hiley: The Undivided Universe&quot; and references therein. Another approach is given by Dürr et al., who use Bohm–Dirac models and a Lorentz-invariant foliation of space-time.

Thus, Dürr et al. (1999) showed that it is possible to formally restore Lorentz invariance for the Bohm–Dirac theory by introducing additional structure. This approach still requires a foliation of space-time. While this is in conflict with the standard interpretation of relativity, the preferred foliation, if unobservable, does not lead to any empirical conflicts with relativity. In 2013, Dürr et al. suggested that the required foliation could be covariantly determined by the wavefunction.

The relation between nonlocality and preferred foliation can be better understood as follows. In de Broglie–Bohm theory, nonlocality manifests as the fact that the velocity and acceleration of one particle depends on the instantaneous positions of all other particles. On the other hand, in the theory of relativity the concept of instantaneousness does not have an invariant meaning. Thus, to define particle trajectories, one needs an additional rule that defines which space-time points should be considered instantaneous. The simplest way to achieve this is to introduce a preferred foliation of space-time by hand, such that each hypersurface of the foliation defines a hypersurface of equal time.

Initially, it had been considered impossible to set out a description of photon trajectories in the de Broglie–Bohm theory in view of the difficulties of describing bosons relativistically. In 1996, Partha Ghose presented a relativistic quantum-mechanical description of spin-0 and spin-1 bosons starting from the Duffin–Kemmer–Petiau equation, setting out Bohmian trajectories for massive bosons and for massless bosons (and therefore photons). In 2001, Jean-Pierre Vigier emphasized the importance of deriving a well-defined description of light in terms of particle trajectories in the framework of either the Bohmian mechanics or the Nelson stochastic mechanics. The same year, Ghose worked out Bohmian photon trajectories for specific cases. Subsequent weak-measurement experiments yielded trajectories that coincide with the predicted trajectories. The significance of these experimental findings is controversial.

Chris Dewdney and G. Horton have proposed a relativistically covariant, wave-functional formulation of Bohm&#x27;s quantum field theory and have extended it to a form that allows the inclusion of gravity.

Nikolić has proposed a Lorentz-covariant formulation of the Bohmian interpretation of many-particle wavefunctions. He has developed a generalized relativistic-invariant probabilistic interpretation of quantum theory, in which formula_37 is no longer a probability density in space, but a probability density in space-time. He uses this generalized probabilistic interpretation to formulate a relativistic-covariant version of de Broglie–Bohm theory without introducing a preferred foliation of space-time. His work also covers the extension of the Bohmian interpretation to a quantization of fields and strings.
Roderick I. Sutherland at the University in Sydney has a Lagrangian formalism for the pilot wave and its . It draws on Yakir Aharonov&#x27;s retrocasual weak measurements to explain many-particle entanglement in a special relativistic way without the need for configuration space. The basic idea was already published by Olivier Costa de Beauregard in the 1950s and is also used by John Cramer in his transactional interpretation except the beables that exist between the von Neumann strong projection operator measurements. Sutherland&#x27;s Lagrangian includes two-way action-reaction between pilot wave and beables. Therefore, it is a post-quantum non-statistical theory with final boundary conditions that violate the no-signal theorems of quantum theory. Just as special relativity is a limiting case of general relativity when the spacetime curvature vanishes, so, too is statistical no-entanglement signaling quantum theory with the Born rule a limiting case of the post-quantum action-reaction Lagrangian when the reaction is set to zero and the final boundary condition is integrated out.

=== Spin ===
To incorporate spin, the wavefunction becomes complex-vector-valued. The value space is called spin space; for a spin-1/2 particle, spin space can be taken to be formula_69. The guiding equation is modified by taking inner products in spin space to reduce the complex vectors to complex numbers. The Schrödinger equation is modified by adding a Pauli spin term:

formula_70

where
* formula_71 — the mass, charge and magnetic moment of the formula_26–th particle
* formula_73 — the appropriate spin operator acting in the formula_26–th particle&#x27;s spin space
* formula_75 — spin quantum number of the formula_26–th particle (formula_77 for electron)
* formula_78 is vector potential in formula_79
* formula_80 is the magnetic field in formula_79
* formula_82 is the covariant derivative, involving the vector potential, ascribed to the coordinates of formula_26–th particle (in SI units)
* formula_22 — the wavefunction defined on the multidimensional configuration space; e.g. a system consisting of two spin-1/2 particles and one spin-1 particle has a wavefunction of the form formula_85 where formula_86 is a tensor product, so this spin space is 12-dimensional
* formula_87 is the inner product in spin space formula_88: formula_89

=== Stochastic electrodynamics ===

Stochastic electrodynamics (SED) is an extension of the de Broglie–Bohm interpretation of quantum mechanics, with the electromagnetic zero-point field (ZPF) playing a central role as the guiding pilot-wave. Modern approaches to SED, like those proposed by the group around late Gerhard Grössing, among others, consider wave and particle-like quantum effects as well-coordinated emergent systems. These emergent systems are the result of speculated and calculated sub-quantum interactions with the zero-point field.

=== Quantum field theory ===
In Dürr et al., the authors describe an extension of de Broglie–Bohm theory for handling creation and annihilation operators, which they refer to as &quot;Bell-type quantum field theories&quot;. The basic idea is that configuration space becomes the (disjoint) space of all possible configurations of any number of particles. For part of the time, the system evolves deterministically under the guiding equation with a fixed number of particles. But under a stochastic process, particles may be created and annihilated. The distribution of creation events is dictated by the wavefunction. The wavefunction itself is evolving at all times over the full multi-particle configuration space.

Hrvoje Nikolić introduces a purely deterministic de Broglie–Bohm theory of particle creation and destruction, according to which particle trajectories are continuous, but particle detectors behave as if particles have been created or destroyed even when a true creation or destruction of particles does not take place.

=== Curved space ===
To extend de Broglie–Bohm theory to curved space (Riemannian manifolds in mathematical parlance), one simply notes that all of the elements of these equations make sense, such as gradients and Laplacians. Thus, we use equations that have the same form as above. Topological and boundary conditions may apply in supplementing the evolution of Schrödinger&#x27;s equation.

For a de Broglie–Bohm theory on curved space with spin, the spin space becomes a vector bundle over configuration space, and the potential in Schrödinger&#x27;s equation becomes a local self-adjoint operator acting on that space.
The field equations for the de Broglie–Bohm theory in the relativistic case with spin can also be given for curved space-times with torsion.

In a general spacetime with curvature and torsion, the guiding equation for the four-velocity formula_90 of an elementary fermion particle isformula_91where the wave function formula_22 is a spinor, formula_93 is the corresponding adjoint, formula_94 are the Dirac matrices, and formula_95 is a tetrad. If the wave function propagates according to the curved Dirac equation, then the particle moves according to the Mathisson-Papapetrou equations of motion, which are an extension of the geodesic equation. This relativistic wave-particle duality follows from the conservation laws for the spin tensor and energy-momentum tensor, and also from the covariant Heisenberg picture equation of motion. 

=== Exploiting nonlocality ===
De Broglie and Bohm&#x27;s causal interpretation of quantum mechanics was later extended by Bohm, Vigier, Hiley, Valentini and others to include stochastic properties. Bohm and other physicists, including Valentini, view the Born rule linking formula_96 to the probability density function formula_97 as representing not a basic law, but a result of a system having reached &quot;quantum equilibrium&quot; during the course of the time development under the Schrödinger equation. It can be shown that, once an equilibrium has been reached, the system remains in such equilibrium over the course of its further evolution: this follows from the continuity equation associated with the Schrödinger evolution of formula_22. It is less straightforward to demonstrate whether and how such an equilibrium is reached in the first place.

Antony Valentini has extended de Broglie–Bohm theory to include signal nonlocality that would allow entanglement to be used as a stand-alone communication channel without a secondary classical &quot;key&quot; signal to &quot;unlock&quot; the message encoded in the entanglement. This violates orthodox quantum theory but has the virtue of making the parallel universes of the chaotic inflation theory observable in principle.

Unlike de Broglie–Bohm theory, Valentini&#x27;s theory the wavefunction evolution also depends on the ontological variables. This introduces an instability, a feedback loop that pushes the hidden variables out of &quot;sub-quantal heat death&quot;. The resulting theory becomes nonlinear and non-unitary. Valentini argues that the laws of quantum mechanics are emergent and form a &quot;quantum equilibrium&quot; that is analogous to thermal equilibrium in classical dynamics, such that other &quot;quantum non-equilibrium&quot; distributions may in principle be observed and exploited, for which the statistical predictions of quantum theory are violated. It is controversially argued that quantum theory is merely a special case of a much wider nonlinear physics, a physics in which non-local (superluminal) signalling is possible, and in which the uncertainty principle can be violated.

== Results ==
Below are some highlights of the results that arise out of an analysis of de Broglie–Bohm theory. Experimental results agree with all of quantum mechanics&#x27; standard predictions insofar as it has them. But while standard quantum mechanics is limited to discussing the results of &quot;measurements&quot;, de Broglie–Bohm theory governs the dynamics of a system without the intervention of outside observers (p. 117 in Bell).

The basis for agreement with standard quantum mechanics is that the particles are distributed according to formula_37. This is a statement of observer ignorance: the initial positions are represented by a statistical distribution so deterministic trajectories will result in a statistical distribution.

=== Measuring spin and polarization ===
According to ordinary quantum theory, it is not possible to measure the spin or polarization of a particle directly; instead, the component in one direction is measured; the outcome from a single particle may be 1, meaning that the particle is aligned with the measuring apparatus, or −1, meaning that it is aligned the opposite way. An ensemble of particles prepared by a polarizer to be in state 1 will all measure polarized in state 1 in a subsequent apparatus. A polarized ensemble sent through a polarizer set at angle to the first pass will result in some values of 1 and some of −1 with a probability that depends on the relative alignment. For a full explanation of this, see the Stern–Gerlach experiment.

In de Broglie–Bohm theory, the results of a spin experiment cannot be analyzed without some knowledge of the experimental setup. It is possible to modify the setup so that the trajectory of the particle is unaffected, but that the particle with one setup registers as spin-up, while in the other setup it registers as spin-down. Thus, for the de Broglie–Bohm theory, the particle&#x27;s spin is not an intrinsic property of the particle; instead spin is, so to speak, in the wavefunction of the particle in relation to the particular device being used to measure the spin. This is an illustration of what is sometimes referred to as contextuality and is related to naive realism about operators. Interpretationally, measurement results are a deterministic property of the system and its environment, which includes information about the experimental setup including the context of co-measured observables; in no sense does the system itself possess the property being measured, as would have been the case in classical physics.

=== Measurements, the quantum formalism, and observer independence ===
De Broglie–Bohm theory gives almost the same results as (non-relativisitic) quantum mechanics. It treats the wavefunction as a fundamental object in the theory, as the wavefunction describes how the particles move. This means that no experiment can distinguish between the two theories. This section outlines the ideas as to how the standard quantum formalism arises out of quantum mechanics.

==== Collapse of the wavefunction ====

De Broglie–Bohm theory is a theory that applies primarily to the whole universe. That is, there is a single wavefunction governing the motion of all of the particles in the universe according to the guiding equation. Theoretically, the motion of one particle depends on the positions of all of the other particles in the universe. In some situations, such as in experimental systems, we can represent the system itself in terms of a de Broglie–Bohm theory in which the wavefunction of the system is obtained by conditioning on the environment of the system. Thus, the system can be analyzed with Schrödinger&#x27;s equation and the guiding equation, with an initial formula_37 distribution for the particles in the system (see the section on the conditional wavefunction of a subsystem for details).

It requires a special setup for the conditional wavefunction of a system to obey a quantum evolution. When a system interacts with its environment, such as through a measurement, the conditional wavefunction of the system evolves in a different way. The evolution of the universal wavefunction can become such that the wavefunction of the system appears to be in a superposition of distinct states. But if the environment has recorded the results of the experiment, then using the actual Bohmian configuration of the environment to condition on, the conditional wavefunction collapses to just one alternative, the one corresponding with the measurement results.

Collapse of the universal wavefunction never occurs in de Broglie–Bohm theory. Its entire evolution is governed by Schrödinger&#x27;s equation, and the particles&#x27; evolutions are governed by the guiding equation. Collapse only occurs in a phenomenological way for systems that seem to follow their own Schrödinger&#x27;s equation. As this is an effective description of the system, it is a matter of choice as to what to define the experimental system to include, and this will affect when &quot;collapse&quot; occurs.

==== Operators as observables ====
In the standard quantum formalism, measuring observables is generally thought of as measuring operators on the Hilbert space. For example, measuring position is considered to be a measurement of the position operator. This relationship between physical measurements and Hilbert space operators is, for standard quantum mechanics, an additional axiom of the theory. The de Broglie–Bohm theory, by contrast, requires no such measurement axioms (and measurement as such is not a dynamically distinct or special sub-category of physical processes in the theory). In particular, the usual operators-as-observables formalism is, for de Broglie–Bohm theory, a theorem. A major point of the analysis is that many of the measurements of the observables do not correspond to properties of the particles; they are (as in the case of spin discussed above) measurements of the wavefunction.

In the history of de Broglie–Bohm theory, the proponents have often had to deal with claims that this theory is impossible. Such arguments are generally based on inappropriate analysis of operators as observables. If one believes that spin measurements are indeed measuring the spin of a particle that existed prior to the measurement, then one does reach contradictions. De Broglie–Bohm theory deals with this by noting that spin is not a feature of the particle, but rather that of the wavefunction. As such, it only has a definite outcome once the experimental apparatus is chosen. Once that is taken into account, the impossibility theorems become irrelevant.
There are also objections to this theory based on what it says about particular situations usually involving eigenstates of an operator. For example, the ground state of hydrogen is a real wavefunction. According to the guiding equation, this means that the electron is at rest when in this state. Nevertheless, it is distributed according to formula_37, and no contradiction to experimental results is possible to detect.

Operators as observables leads many to believe that many operators are equivalent. De Broglie–Bohm theory, from this perspective, chooses the position observable as a favored observable rather than, say, the momentum observable. Again, the link to the position observable is a consequence of the dynamics. The motivation for de Broglie–Bohm theory is to describe a system of particles. This implies that the goal of the theory is to describe the positions of those particles at all times. Other observables do not have this compelling ontological status. Having definite positions explains having definite results such as flashes on a detector screen. Other observables would not lead to that conclusion, but there need not be any problem in defining a mathematical theory for other observables; see Hyman et al. for an exploration of the fact that a probability density and probability current can be defined for any set of commuting operators.

==== Hidden variables ====
De Broglie–Bohm theory is often referred to as a &quot;hidden-variable&quot; theory. Bohm used this description in his original papers on the subject, writing: &quot;From the point of view of the usual interpretation, these additional elements or parameters [permitting a detailed causal and continuous description of all processes] could be called &#x27;hidden&#x27; variables.&quot; Bohm and Hiley later stated that they found Bohm&#x27;s choice of the term &quot;hidden variables&quot; to be too restrictive. In particular, they argued that a particle is not actually hidden but rather &quot;is what is most directly manifested in an observation [though] its properties cannot be observed with arbitrary precision (within the limits set by uncertainty principle)&quot;. However, others nevertheless treat the term &quot;hidden variable&quot; as a suitable description.

Generalized particle trajectories can be extrapolated from numerous weak measurements on an ensemble of equally prepared systems, and such trajectories coincide with the de Broglie–Bohm trajectories. In particular, an experiment with two entangled photons, in which a set of Bohmian trajectories for one of the photons was determined using weak measurements and postselection, can be understood in terms of a nonlocal connection between that photon&#x27;s trajectory and the other photon&#x27;s polarization. However, not only the De Broglie–Bohm interpretation, but also many other interpretations of quantum mechanics that do not include such trajectories are consistent with such experimental evidence.

=== Different predictions ===
A specialized version of the double slit experiment has been devised to test characteristics of the trajectory predictions.
Experimental realization of this concept disagreed with the Bohm predictions. where they differed from standard quantum mechanics. These conclusions have been the subject of debate.

=== Heisenberg&#x27;s uncertainty principle ===

The Heisenberg&#x27;s uncertainty principle states that when two complementary measurements are made, there is a limit to the product of their accuracy. As an example, if one measures the position with an accuracy of formula_102 and the momentum with an accuracy of formula_103, then formula_104

In de Broglie–Bohm theory, there is always a matter of fact about the position and momentum of a particle. Each particle has a well-defined trajectory, as well as a wavefunction. Observers have limited knowledge as to what this trajectory is (and thus of the position and momentum). It is the lack of knowledge of the particle&#x27;s trajectory that accounts for the uncertainty relation. What one can know about a particle at any given time is described by the wavefunction. Since the uncertainty relation can be derived from the wavefunction in other interpretations of quantum mechanics, it can be likewise derived (in the epistemic sense mentioned above) on the de Broglie–Bohm theory.

To put the statement differently, the particles&#x27; positions are only known statistically. As in classical mechanics, successive observations of the particles&#x27; positions refine the experimenter&#x27;s knowledge of the particles&#x27; initial conditions. Thus, with succeeding observations, the initial conditions become more and more restricted. This formalism is consistent with the normal use of the Schrödinger equation.

For the derivation of the uncertainty relation, see Heisenberg uncertainty principle, noting that this article describes the principle from the viewpoint of the Copenhagen interpretation.

=== Quantum entanglement, Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox, Bell&#x27;s theorem, and nonlocality ===
De Broglie–Bohm theory highlighted the issue of nonlocality: it inspired John Stewart Bell to prove his now-famous theorem, which in turn led to the Bell test experiments.

In the Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox, the authors describe a thought experiment that one could perform on a pair of particles that have interacted, the results of which they interpreted as indicating that quantum mechanics is an incomplete theory.

Decades later John Bell proved Bell&#x27;s theorem (see p. 14 in Bell), in which he showed that, if they are to agree with the empirical predictions of quantum mechanics, all such &quot;hidden-variable&quot; completions of quantum mechanics must either be nonlocal (as the Bohm interpretation is) or give up the assumption that experiments produce unique results (see counterfactual definiteness and many-worlds interpretation). In particular, Bell proved that any local theory with unique results must make empirical predictions satisfying a statistical constraint called &quot;Bell&#x27;s inequality&quot;.

Alain Aspect performed a series of Bell test experiments that test Bell&#x27;s inequality using an EPR-type setup. Aspect&#x27;s results show experimentally that Bell&#x27;s inequality is in fact violated, meaning that the relevant quantum-mechanical predictions are correct. In these Bell test experiments, entangled pairs of particles are created; the particles are separated, traveling to remote measuring apparatus. The orientation of the measuring apparatus can be changed while the particles are in flight, demonstrating the apparent nonlocality of the effect.

The de Broglie–Bohm theory makes the same (empirically correct) predictions for the Bell test experiments as ordinary quantum mechanics. It is able to do this because it is manifestly nonlocal. It is often criticized or rejected based on this; Bell&#x27;s attitude was: &quot;It is a merit of the de Broglie–Bohm version to bring this [nonlocality] out so explicitly that it cannot be ignored.&quot;

The de Broglie–Bohm theory describes the physics in the Bell test experiments as follows: to understand the evolution of the particles, we need to set up a wave equation for both particles; the orientation of the apparatus affects the wavefunction. The particles in the experiment follow the guidance of the wavefunction. It is the wavefunction that carries the faster-than-light effect of changing the orientation of the apparatus. Maudlin provides an analysis of exactly what kind of nonlocality is present and how it is compatible with relativity. Bell has shown that the nonlocality does not allow superluminal communication. Maudlin has shown this in greater detail.

=== Classical limit ===
Bohm&#x27;s formulation of de Broglie–Bohm theory in a classical-looking version has the merits that the emergence of classical behavior seems to follow immediately for any situation in which the quantum potential is negligible, as noted by Bohm in 1952. Modern methods of decoherence are relevant to an analysis of this limit. See Allori et al. for steps towards a rigorous analysis.

=== Quantum trajectory method ===
Work by Robert E. Wyatt in the early 2000s attempted to use the Bohm &quot;particles&quot; as an adaptive mesh that follows the actual trajectory of a quantum state in time and space. In the &quot;quantum trajectory&quot; method, one samples the quantum wavefunction with a mesh of quadrature points. One then evolves the quadrature points in time according to the Bohm equations of motion. At each time step, one then re-synthesizes the wavefunction from the points, recomputes the quantum forces, and continues the calculation. (QuickTime movies of this for H + H2 reactive scattering can be found on the Wyatt group web-site at UT Austin.)
This approach has been adapted, extended, and used by a number of researchers in the chemical physics community as a way to compute semi-classical and quasi-classical molecular dynamics. A 2007 issue of The Journal of Physical Chemistry A was dedicated to Prof. Wyatt and his work on &quot;computational Bohmian dynamics&quot;.

Eric R. Bittner&#x27;s group at the University of Houston has advanced a statistical variant of this approach that uses Bayesian sampling technique to sample the quantum density and compute the quantum potential on a structureless mesh of points. This technique was recently used to estimate quantum effects in the heat capacity of small clusters Nen for &quot;n&quot; ≈ 100.

There remain difficulties using the Bohmian approach, mostly associated with the formation of singularities in the quantum potential due to nodes in the quantum wavefunction. In general, nodes forming due to interference effects lead to the case where formula_105 This results in an infinite force on the sample particles forcing them to move away from the node and often crossing the path of other sample points (which violates single-valuedness). Various schemes have been developed to overcome this; however, no general solution has yet emerged.

These methods, as does Bohm&#x27;s Hamilton–Jacobi formulation, do not apply to situations in which the full dynamics of spin need to be taken into account.

The properties of trajectories in the de Broglie–Bohm theory differ significantly from the Moyal quantum trajectories as well as the quantum trajectories from the unraveling of an open quantum system.

== Similarities with the many-worlds interpretation ==
Kim Joris Boström has proposed a non-relativistic quantum mechanical theory that combines elements of de Broglie-Bohm mechanics and Everett&#x27;s many-worlds. In particular, the unreal many-worlds interpretation of Hawking and Weinberg is similar to the Bohmian concept of unreal empty branch worlds:

Many authors have expressed critical views of de Broglie–Bohm theory by comparing it to Everett&#x27;s many-worlds approach. Many (but not all) proponents of de Broglie–Bohm theory (such as Bohm and Bell) interpret the universal wavefunction as physically real. According to some supporters of Everett&#x27;s theory, if the (never collapsing) wavefunction is taken to be physically real, then it is natural to interpret the theory as having the same many worlds as Everett&#x27;s theory. In the Everettian view the role of the Bohmian particle is to act as a &quot;pointer&quot;, tagging, or selecting, just one branch of the universal wavefunction (the assumption that this branch indicates which &quot;wave packet&quot; determines the observed result of a given experiment is called the &quot;result assumption&quot;); the other branches are designated &quot;empty&quot; and implicitly assumed by Bohm to be devoid of conscious observers. H. Dieter Zeh comments on these &quot;empty&quot; branches:

David Deutsch has expressed the same point more &quot;acerbically&quot;:
This conclusion has been challenged by Detlef Dürr and Justin Lazarovici:
The Bohmian, of course, cannot accept this argument. For her, it is decidedly the particle configuration in three-dimensional space and not the wave function on the abstract configuration space that constitutes a world (or rather, the world). Instead, she will accuse the Everettian of not having local beables (in Bell&#x27;s sense) in her theory, that is, the ontological variables that refer to localized entities in three-dimensional space or four-dimensional spacetime. The many worlds of her theory thus merely appear as a grotesque consequence of this omission.

== Occam&#x27;s-razor criticism ==
Both Hugh Everett III and Bohm treated the wavefunction as a physically real field. Everett&#x27;s many-worlds interpretation is an attempt to demonstrate that the wavefunction alone is sufficient to account for all our observations. When we see the particle detectors flash or hear the click of a Geiger counter, Everett&#x27;s theory interprets this as our &quot;wavefunction&quot; responding to changes in the detector&#x27;s &quot;wavefunction&quot;, which is responding in turn to the passage of another &quot;wavefunction&quot; (which we think of as a &quot;particle&quot;, but is actually just another wave packet). No particle (in the Bohm sense of having a defined position and velocity) exists according to that theory. For this reason Everett sometimes referred to his own many-worlds approach as the &quot;pure wave theory&quot;. Of Bohm&#x27;s 1952 approach, Everett said:
In the Everettian view, then, the Bohm particles are superfluous entities, similar to, and equally as unnecessary as, for example, the luminiferous ether, which was found to be unnecessary in special relativity. This argument is sometimes called the &quot;redundancy argument&quot;, since the superfluous particles are redundant in the sense of Occam&#x27;s razor.

According to Brown &amp; Wallace, the de Broglie–Bohm particles play no role in the solution of the measurement problem. For these authors, the &quot;result assumption&quot; (see above) is inconsistent with the view that there is no measurement problem in the predictable outcome (i.e. single-outcome) case. They also say that a standard tacit assumption of de Broglie–Bohm theory (that an observer becomes aware of configurations of particles of ordinary objects by means of correlations between such configurations and the configuration of the particles in the observer&#x27;s brain) is unreasonable. This conclusion has been challenged by Valentini, who argues that the entirety of such objections arises from a failure to interpret de Broglie–Bohm theory on its own terms.

According to Peter R. Holland, in a wider Hamiltonian framework, theories can be formulated in which particles &quot;do&quot; act back on the wave function.

== Derivations ==
De Broglie–Bohm theory has been derived many times and in many ways. Below are six derivations, all of which are very different and lead to different ways of understanding and extending this theory.
* Schrödinger&#x27;s equation can be derived by using Einstein&#x27;s light quanta hypothesis: formula_106 and de Broglie&#x27;s hypothesis: formula_107.
:The guiding equation can be derived in a similar fashion. We assume a plane wave: formula_108. Notice that formula_109. Assuming that formula_110 for the particle&#x27;s actual velocity, we have that formula_111. Thus, we have the guiding equation.
:Notice that this derivation does not use Schrödinger&#x27;s equation.
* Preserving the density under the time evolution is another method of derivation. This is the method that Bell cites. It is this method that generalizes to many possible alternative theories. The starting point is the continuity equation formula_112 for the density formula_113. This equation describes a probability flow along a current. We take the velocity field associated with this current as the velocity field whose integral curves yield the motion of the particle.
* A method applicable for particles without spin is to do a polar decomposition of the wavefunction and transform Schrödinger&#x27;s equation into two coupled equations: the continuity equation from above and the Hamilton–Jacobi equation. This is the method used by Bohm in 1952. The decomposition and equations are as follows:

:Decomposition: formula_114 Note that formula_115 corresponds to the probability density formula_116.

:Continuity equation: formula_117.

:Hamilton–Jacobi equation: formula_118

:The Hamilton–Jacobi equation is the equation derived from a Newtonian system with potential formula_119 and velocity field formula_120 The potential formula_30 is the classical potential that appears in Schrödinger&#x27;s equation, and the other term involving formula_96 is the quantum potential, terminology introduced by Bohm.

:This leads to viewing the quantum theory as particles moving under the classical force modified by a quantum force. However, unlike standard Newtonian mechanics, the initial velocity field is already specified by formula_123, which is a symptom of this being a first-order theory, not a second-order theory.
* A fourth derivation was given by Dürr et al. In their derivation, they derive the velocity field by demanding the appropriate transformation properties given by the various symmetries that Schrödinger&#x27;s equation satisfies, once the wavefunction is suitably transformed. The guiding equation is what emerges from that analysis.
* A fifth derivation, given by Dürr et al. is appropriate for generalization to quantum field theory and the Dirac equation. The idea is that a velocity field can also be understood as a first-order differential operator acting on functions. Thus, if we know how it acts on functions, we know what it is. Then given the Hamiltonian operator formula_124, the equation to satisfy for all functions formula_125 (with associated multiplication operator formula_126) is formula_127, where formula_128 is the local Hermitian inner product on the value space of the wavefunction.

:This formulation allows for stochastic theories such as the creation and annihilation of particles.
* A further derivation has been given by Peter R. Holland, on which he bases his quantum-physics textbook &quot;The Quantum Theory of Motion&quot;. It is based on three basic postulates and an additional fourth postulate that links the wavefunction to measurement probabilities:
*# A physical system consists in a spatiotemporally propagating wave and a point particle guided by it.
*# The wave is described mathematically by a solution formula_22 to Schrödinger&#x27;s wave equation.
*# The particle motion is described by a solution to formula_130 in dependence on initial condition formula_131, with formula_132 the phase of formula_22.The fourth postulate is subsidiary yet consistent with the first three:
*# The probability formula_134 to find the particle in the differential volume formula_135 at time &quot;t&quot; equals formula_136.

== History ==

The theory was historically developed in the 1920s by de Broglie, who, in 1927, was persuaded to abandon it in favour of the then-mainstream Copenhagen interpretation. David Bohm, dissatisfied with the prevailing orthodoxy, rediscovered de Broglie&#x27;s pilot-wave theory in 1952. Bohm&#x27;s suggestions were not then widely received, partly due to reasons unrelated to their content, such as Bohm&#x27;s youthful communist affiliations. The de Broglie–Bohm theory was widely deemed unacceptable by mainstream theorists, mostly because of its explicit non-locality. On the theory, John Stewart Bell, author of the 1964 Bell&#x27;s theorem wrote in 1982: 

Since the 1990s, there has been renewed interest in formulating extensions to de Broglie–Bohm theory, attempting to reconcile it with special relativity and quantum field theory, besides other features such as spin or curved spatial geometries.

De Broglie–Bohm theory has a history of different formulations and names. In this section, each stage is given a name and a main reference.

=== Pilot-wave theory ===

Louis de Broglie presented his pilot wave theory at the 1927 Solvay Conference, after close collaboration with Schrödinger, who developed his wave equation for de Broglie&#x27;s theory. At the end of the presentation, Wolfgang Pauli pointed out that it was not compatible with a semi-classical technique Fermi had previously adopted in the case of inelastic scattering. Contrary to a popular legend, de Broglie actually gave the correct rebuttal that the particular technique could not be generalized for Pauli&#x27;s purpose, although the audience might have been lost in the technical details and de Broglie&#x27;s mild manner left the impression that Pauli&#x27;s objection was valid. He was eventually persuaded to abandon this theory nonetheless because he was &quot;discouraged by criticisms which [it] roused&quot;. De Broglie&#x27;s theory already applies to multiple spin-less particles, but lacks an adequate theory of measurement as no one understood quantum decoherence at the time. An analysis of de Broglie&#x27;s presentation is given in Bacciagaluppi et al. Also, in 1932 John von Neumann published a no hidden variables proof in his book &quot;Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics&quot;, that was widely believed to prove that all hidden-variable theories are impossible. This sealed the fate of de Broglie&#x27;s theory for the next two decades.

In 1926, Erwin Madelung had developed a hydrodynamic version of Schrödinger&#x27;s equation, which is incorrectly considered as a basis for the density current derivation of the de Broglie–Bohm theory. The Madelung equations, being quantum analog of Euler equations of fluid dynamics, differ philosophically from the de Broglie–Bohm mechanics and are the basis of the stochastic interpretation of quantum mechanics.

Peter R. Holland has pointed out that, earlier in 1927, Einstein had actually submitted a preprint with a similar proposal but, not convinced, had withdrawn it before publication. According to Holland, failure to appreciate key points of the de Broglie–Bohm theory has led to confusion, the key point being &quot;that the trajectories of a many-body quantum system are correlated not because the particles exert a direct force on one another (&quot;à la&quot; Coulomb) but because all are acted upon by an entity – mathematically described by the wavefunction or functions of it – that lies beyond them&quot;. This entity is the quantum potential.

After publishing his popular textbook &quot;Quantum Theory&quot; that adhered entirely to the Copenhagen orthodoxy, Bohm was persuaded by Einstein to take a critical look at von Neumann&#x27;s no hidden variables proof. The result was &#x27;A Suggested Interpretation of the Quantum Theory in Terms of &quot;Hidden Variables&quot; I and II&#x27; [Bohm 1952]. It was an independent origination of the pilot wave theory, and extended it to incorporate a consistent theory of measurement, and to address a criticism of Pauli that de Broglie did not properly respond to; it is taken to be deterministic (though Bohm hinted in the original papers that there should be disturbances to this, in the way Brownian motion disturbs Newtonian mechanics). This stage is known as the &quot;de Broglie–Bohm Theory&quot; in Bell&#x27;s work [Bell 1987] and is the basis for &#x27;The Quantum Theory of Motion&#x27; [Holland 1993].

This stage applies to multiple particles, and is deterministic.

The de Broglie–Bohm theory is an example of a hidden-variables theory. Bohm originally hoped that hidden variables could provide a local, causal, objective description that would resolve or eliminate many of the paradoxes of quantum mechanics, such as Schrödinger&#x27;s cat, the measurement problem and the collapse of the wavefunction. However, Bell&#x27;s theorem complicates this hope, as it demonstrates that there can be no local hidden-variable theory that is compatible with the predictions of quantum mechanics. The Bohmian interpretation is causal but not local.

Bohm&#x27;s paper was largely ignored or panned by other physicists. Albert Einstein, who had suggested that Bohm search for a realist alternative to the prevailing Copenhagen approach, did not consider Bohm&#x27;s interpretation to be a satisfactory answer to the quantum nonlocality question, calling it &quot;too cheap&quot;, while Werner Heisenberg considered it a &quot;superfluous &#x27;ideological superstructure&#x27; &quot;. Wolfgang Pauli, who had been unconvinced by de Broglie in 1927, conceded to Bohm as follows:

I just received your long letter of 20th November, and I also have studied more thoroughly the details of your paper. I do not see any longer the possibility of any logical contradiction as long as your results agree completely with those of the usual wave mechanics and as long as no means is given to measure the values of your hidden parameters both in the measuring apparatus and in the observe [sic] system. As far as the whole matter stands now, your &#x27;extra wave-mechanical predictions&#x27; are still a check, which cannot be cashed.

He subsequently described Bohm&#x27;s theory as &quot;artificial metaphysics&quot;.

According to physicist Max Dresden, when Bohm&#x27;s theory was presented at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, many of the objections were ad hominem, focusing on Bohm&#x27;s sympathy with communists as exemplified by his refusal to give testimony to the House Un-American Activities Committee.

In 1979, Chris Philippidis, Chris Dewdney and Basil Hiley were the first to perform numeric computations on the basis of the quantum potential to deduce ensembles of particle trajectories. Their work renewed the interests of physicists in the Bohm interpretation of quantum physics.

Eventually John Bell began to defend the theory. In &quot;Speakable and Unspeakable in Quantum Mechanics&quot; [Bell 1987], several of the papers refer to hidden-variables theories (which include Bohm&#x27;s).

The trajectories of the Bohm model that would result for particular experimental arrangements were termed &quot;surreal&quot; by some. Still in 2016, mathematical physicist Sheldon Goldstein said of Bohm&#x27;s theory: &quot;There was a time when you couldn&#x27;t even talk about it because it was heretical. It probably still is the kiss of death for a physics career to be actually working on Bohm, but maybe that&#x27;s changing.&quot;

=== Bohmian mechanics ===
Bohmian mechanics is the same theory, but with an emphasis on the notion of current flow, which is determined on the basis of the quantum equilibrium hypothesis that the probability follows the Born rule. The term &quot;Bohmian mechanics&quot; is also often used to include most of the further extensions past the spin-less version of Bohm. While de Broglie–Bohm theory has Lagrangians and Hamilton-Jacobi equations as a primary focus and backdrop, with the icon of the quantum potential, Bohmian mechanics considers the continuity equation as primary and has the guiding equation as its icon. They are mathematically equivalent in so far as the Hamilton-Jacobi formulation applies, i.e., spin-less particles.

All of non-relativistic quantum mechanics can be fully accounted for in this theory. Recent studies have used this formalism to compute the evolution of many-body quantum systems, with a considerable increase in speed as compared to other quantum-based methods.

=== Causal interpretation and ontological interpretation ===
Bohm developed his original ideas, calling them the &quot;Causal Interpretation&quot;. Later he felt that &quot;causal&quot; sounded too much like &quot;deterministic&quot; and preferred to call his theory the &quot;Ontological Interpretation&quot;. The main reference is &quot;The Undivided Universe&quot; (Bohm, Hiley 1993).

This stage covers work by Bohm and in collaboration with Jean-Pierre Vigier and Basil Hiley. Bohm is clear that this theory is non-deterministic (the work with Hiley includes a stochastic theory). As such, this theory is not strictly speaking a formulation of de Broglie–Bohm theory, but it deserves mention here because the term &quot;Bohm Interpretation&quot; is ambiguous between this theory and de Broglie–Bohm theory.

In 1996 philosopher of science Arthur Fine gave an in-depth analysis of possible interpretations of Bohm&#x27;s model of 1952.

William Simpson has suggested a hylomorphic interpretation of Bohmian mechanics, in which the cosmos is an Aristotelian substance composed of material particles and a substantial form. The wave function is assigned a dispositional role in choreographing the trajectories of the particles.

=== Hydrodynamic quantum analogs ===
Experiments on hydrodynamical analogs of quantum mechanics beginning with the work of Couder and Fort (2006) have purported to show that macroscopic classical pilot-waves can exhibit characteristics previously thought to be restricted to the quantum realm. Hydrodynamic pilot-wave analogs have been claimed to duplicate the double slit experiment, tunneling, quantized orbits, and numerous other quantum phenomena which have led to a resurgence in interest in pilot wave theories. 
The analogs have been compared to the &quot;Faraday wave&quot;.
These results have been disputed: experiments fail to reproduce aspects of the double-slit experiments. High precision measurements in the tunneling case point to a different origin of the unpredictable crossing: rather than initial position uncertainty or environmental noise, interactions at the barrier seem to be involved. 

Another classical analog has been reported in surface gravity waves.

== Surrealistic trajectories ==
In 1992, Englert, Scully, Sussman, and Walther proposed experiments that would show particles taking paths that differ from the Bohm trajectories. They described the Bohm trajectories as &quot;surrealistic&quot;; their proposal was later referred to as ESSW after the last names of the authors.
In 2016, Mahler et al. verified the ESSW predictions. However they propose the surrealistic effect is a consequence of the nonlocality inherent in Bohm&#x27;s theory.

<text>Scotland Yard is a board game in which a team of players controlling different detectives cooperate to track down a player controlling a criminal as they move around a board representing the streets of London. It was first published in 1983 by Ravensburger and is named after Scotland Yard which is the headquarters of London&#x27;s Metropolitan Police Service in real-life. &quot;Scotland Yard&quot; is an asymmetric board game, during which the detective players cooperatively solve a variant of the pursuit–evasion problem.

The game is published by Ravensburger in most of Europe and Canada and by Milton Bradley in the United States. It received the &quot;Spiel des Jahres&quot; (Game of the Year) award in 1983, the same year that it was published.

==Gameplay==
One player controls &#x27;Mr. X&#x27;: a criminal whose location is only revealed periodically throughout gameplay. The other players each control at least one detective, all of which are always present on the board. In the Milton Bradley version, there are always five detectives on the board, so with less than six players, one player can control two or three detectives.

===Setup===

Each player draws one card for each piece under their control to determine their initial location(s), with Mr. X drawing first. The detectives place their tokens at the locations they drew, but Mr. X does not. The locations on the cards are spaced far enough apart to ensure that Mr. X cannot be caught in the first round of play. There are a total of 199 spaces (&quot;stations&quot;) on the board.

===Movement===
Movement is governed by using transportation tokens (&quot;tickets&quot;), which allow passage between spaces according to the following modes:
* Taxis, which allow the player to move only one space per turn, but can be used anywhere.
* Buses, which are spaced further apart and allow a player to cover more distance in a single trip.
* The Underground, whose stations are spaced even further apart than the bus stops and allow long-distance travel.
* Ferries, which only Mr. X can use with a black ticket, allowing him to follow routes along the River Thames between Greenwich and Whitehall.

Each detective begins with a finite mix of taxi, bus, and underground tickets. Mr. X starts with the remaining transport tickets; however, detectives must turn their used tickets over to Mr. X, effectively giving that player unlimited travel resources.

From any given space, movement is possible along a line matching the mode of transportation (taxi, bus, or underground) to the closest adjacent space for that mode. Each space is coloured to indicate the modes of transportation available there: yellow for taxis, green for buses, red for the Underground. For example, a player at space #74 could move as follows:
* Taxi to 58, 73, 75, or 92 (closest taxi stop spaces connected by a solid yellow line)
* Bus to 58 or 94 (closest bus stop spaces connected by a solid green line)
* Underground to 46 (sole closest underground stop space connected by a broken red line)

Mr. X also has a supply of black tickets that are valid for any mode of transport available at their current location. These tickets can also be used to move between the ferry stops on the River Thames, joined by black lines; Mr. X is the only one who can travel in this manner. In addition, the player assuming the role of Mr. X is given several double-move tokens, which allows them to make two moves in a single turn.

A space may be occupied by only one (visible) pawn at a time. If an adjacent space is already occupied, the pawn may not be moved there. However, a player travelling by bus or underground may bypass an occupied space if the closest adjacent stop in that direction is open.

Mr. X&#x27;s movements are documented through a &quot;travel log&quot; with paper inserts, divided into slots that are covered by used tickets. For each move that Mr. X makes, they write down their destination secretly and then cover it with the ticket they have used to reach it, thus providing the detectives with clues as to their whereabouts. The first number written down is not the starting space, but is the first destination using the ticket displayed. If a double move is used, Mr. X must log both moves separately, use a transportation ticket for each one, and surrender one of the double move tickets. Mr. X moves first on every turn, after which the detectives move in any order.

At five specific times during the game, Mr. X has to reveal their current position. The windows on the travel log for these moves are shaped differently to remind the player to do so. Detectives may take this opportunity to refine their search and, if possible, plan ways to encircle them based on where they are and the next few moves they make. Should one of these five moments occur on the first half of a double move, Mr. X makes the first move, places their pawn on the space visited and allows the detectives to see it, then removes it and makes the second move.

===Objective===
The detectives win the game if any of them lands on Mr. X&#x27;s current location, or if it becomes impossible for Mr. X to move without landing on a detective. Mr. X wins by avoiding capture until all detectives can no longer move because they have either exhausted their ticket supplies or reached positions from which they cannot move because they have no usable tickets.

===Equipment===

The game was updated with slightly different rules and equipment in 2013. The 2013 Ravensburger and 1985 Milton Bradley editions vary slightly in the number of transportation tickets, double-move, and starting position cards included, as noted. In the Milton Bradley version, there are 18 starting position cards, shared by both the detectives and Mr. X. In the 2013 edition, the 29 start cards are split into two separate pools, one for Mr. X and another for the detectives.

In a game with five or fewer players, up to two of the pawns meant to represent the detectives may instead be designated as &quot;bobbies&quot;, indicated by placing a circular ring on them. Bobbies can move freely throughout the city without using tickets; during the detectives&#x27; turn, they decide by consensus whether and where to move each one.

As published by Ravensburger in 2013, it contains:
*1 game board (a map of Central London)
*6 colored playing pieces
*130 transportation tickets
*1 label sheet
*29 start cards
*3 double-move tokens
*1 travel log and paper inserts
*1 storage tray to be used to store tickets, start cards and playing pieces
The main game board also varies slightly between the Milton Bradley (1985) and Ravensburger editions. The primary difference between these is in the numbering of the stations: five stations are numbered differently, with 108 missing from the Milton Bradley boards and 200 missing from the Ravensburger boards. Aside from the numbering differences, some of the routes have been revised since the initial publication. For instance, stations 198 and 199 are connected by a bus line in earlier boards, which is changed to a taxi line, and the taxi line between stations 13 and 14 in early boards was later removed.

==Alternative versions==
The game has been adapted to take place on maps of different cities. &quot;Scotland Yard Tokyo&quot;, also distributed by Ravensburger is set on the streets of Tokyo; the major difference is game aesthetics. &quot;Scotland Yard: Swiss Edition&quot; uses the same gameplay and is set in Switzerland, with the addition of more boat routes and ski areas available only to Mr. X.

&quot;NY Chase&quot; is a version based on New York City. In this version, detectives do not hand their used tokens over, and they have access to roadblocks and a helicopter, tilting the game more in favour of those playing as detectives.

A faster travel version called &quot;Die Jagd Nach Mister X&quot; exists that functions quite differently. In this version, Mr. X&#x27;s location is only hidden when a black travel token is used, and the game is essentially an open chase around London. Evasion is accomplished with black tokens and using the fastest travel to distant locations. In this version, each player takes turns as Mr. X, and points collected (in the form of the detectives&#x27; used travel tokens) determine the overall winner.

== Alternative rules ==
In 1986, Alain Munoz and Serge Laget posted an article in the French magazine &quot;Jeux &amp; Stratégie&quot; suggesting alternative rules to balance and expand the game.

Spanish company Cefa published Alerta Roja (Red Alert) in 1986, which is generally a remake of Scotland Yard with minor variations to the rules and a different theme (secret agents chase a nuclear terrorist though the sewers of a futuristic city).

===Beginners===
Ravensburger has published rules designed to introduce new players to the game. In the &quot;beginners version&quot;, Mr. X starts on space 82, and the detectives start on 41, 46, and/or 124, with 142 added if four detectives are playing. The number of turns is reduced to 13, underground tickets are not used, and Mr. X is limited to one concealed-move ticket and one double-move ticket.

==Adaptations==
The game was first adapted for the Game Boy in 1990, and then as &quot;Scotland Yard Interactive&quot; for the Philips CD-I in 1993. It was adapted for Windows by Cryo Interactive in 1998, for the Nintendo DS by Sproing Interactive in 2008, as well as for iPhone (2012) and Android (2015) by Ravensburger Digital.

==Reception==
&quot;Games&quot; included &quot;Scotland Yard&quot; in its top 100 games of 1986, calling it &quot;a suspenseful chase through the streets of London in this game of deduction and bluff.&quot; The reviewer noted &quot;Trapping Mr. X requires logic and teamwork; eluding the detectives takes sneakiness and an occasional risky move by Mr. X.&quot; A review from &quot;Lautapeliopas&quot; praised the game&#x27;s accessibility and functionality, but said the playing as detectives is less engaging.

<text>Year 888 ([[Roman numerals|DCCCLXXXVIII]]) was a leap year starting on Monday of the Julian calendar.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Europe ====
* January 13 – Emperor Charles III (the Fat) dies at Neidingen, after having suffered repeat bouts of an illness that may have been epilepsy. The Frankish Empire is split again, and falls apart into separate kingdoms. Count Odo, the hero of the Siege of Paris, is elected king of the West Frankish Kingdom, and crowned at Compiègne by Walter, archbishop of Sens. Other Frankish noblemen support the 8-year-old Charles the Simple (the posthumous son of the late king Louis the Stammerer).
* October – Alan I (the Great), count of Vannes, and his rival Judicael, unite their forces to defeat the Vikings at Questembert (or 889). Judicael is killed, in a notable victory for the Bretons, with 15,000 Vikings crushed, some few 400 escaping to their ships. In command of a &#x27;united&#x27; Breton force, Alan is able to drive the Vikings back to the Loire River. Alan becomes sole ruler of Brittany, and over the Frankish counties of Rennes, Nantes, Coutances and Avranches.
* October – Battle of Milazzo: the Aghlabids score a crushing victory over a Byzantine fleet off Sicily.
* Winter – King Arnulf of Carinthia leads an East Frankish expedition into Italy, after he is recognized as overlord of France and Burgundy. Arnulf descends with an army over the Brenner Pass, and meets King Berengar I at a peace conference at Trento. Berengar grants him two counties in the Val d&#x27;Adige (Northern Italy), and does homage to Arnulf as overlord. In turn, Arnulf confirms Berengar as king of Lombardia, and returns to Germany.

* Lord Æthelred II of the Mercians is struck down with a debilitating illness. His wife, Princess Æthelflæd (a daughter of Alfred the Great) of Wessex, joins him as joint ruler of Mercia (approximate date).
* The Aghlabids issue decrees according to which Jews and Christians are to wear a patch (ruq&#x27;a) of white fabric on their shoulder of their outer garment, with the patch for Jews depicting an ape and that for the Christians depicting a pig.

==== Al-Andalus ====
* Al-Mundhir, Moorish emir of Córdoba, dies after a two-year reign (possibly murdered by his brother Abdullah ibn Muhammad al-Umawi, who succeeds him as ruler of the Emirate of Córdoba).

==== China ====
* April 20 – Emperor Xi Zong (Li Xuan) dies of illness at Chang&#x27;an, after a 14-year reign. He is succeeded by his 21-year-old brother Zhao Zong, as ruler of the Tang Dynasty.

<text>Kensington is an area of London in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, around west of Central London.

The district&#x27;s commercial heart is Kensington High Street, running on an east–west axis. The north-east is taken up by Kensington Gardens, containing the Albert Memorial, the Serpentine Gallery and Speke&#x27;s monument. South Kensington and Gloucester Road are home to Imperial College London, the Royal College of Music, the Royal Albert Hall, Natural History Museum, Victoria and Albert Museum, and Science Museum. The area is also home to many embassies and consulates.

==Name==
The manor of &quot;Chenesitone&quot; is listed in the Domesday Book of 1086, which in the Anglo-Saxon language means &quot;Chenesi&#x27;s ton&quot; (homestead/settlement). One early spelling is &quot;Kesyngton&quot;, as written in 1396.

==History==

The manor of Kensington, in the county of Middlesex, was one of several hundred granted by King William the Conqueror (1066–1089) to Geoffrey de Montbray (or Mowbray), Bishop of Coutances in Normandy, one of his inner circle of advisors and one of the wealthiest men in post-Conquest England. He granted the tenancy of Kensington to his follower Aubrey de Vere I, who was holding the manor from him as overlord in 1086, according to the Domesday Book. The bishop&#x27;s heir, Robert de Mowbray, rebelled against King William II and his vast feudal barony was forfeited to the Crown. Aubrey de Vere I thus became a tenant-in-chief, holding directly from the king after 1095, which increased his status in feudal England. He granted the church and an estate within the manor to Abingdon Abbey in Oxfordshire, at the deathbed request of his eldest son Geoffrey. As the de Veres became Earls of Oxford, their principal manor at Kensington came to be known as Earl&#x27;s Court, as they were not resident in the manor, and their manorial business was not conducted in the great hall of a manor house but in a courthouse. In order to differentiate it, the new sub-manor granted to Abingdon Abbey became known as &quot;Abbot&#x27;s Kensington&quot; and the church &quot;St Mary Abbots&quot;.

The original Kensington Barracks, built at Kensington Gate in the late 18th century, were demolished in 1858 and new barracks were built in Kensington Church Street.

==Geography==
The focus of the area is Kensington High Street, a busy commercial centre with many shops, typically upmarket. The street was declared London&#x27;s second best shopping street in February 2005 due to its wide range and number of shops. However, since October 2008 the street has faced competition from the Westfield shopping centre in nearby White City.

Kensington&#x27;s second group of commercial buildings is at South Kensington, where several streets of small to medium-sized shops and service businesses are situated close to South Kensington tube station. This is also the southern end of Exhibition Road, the thoroughfare which serves the area&#x27;s museums and educational institutions.

The boundaries of Kensington are not well-defined; in particular, the southern part of Kensington has conflicting and complex borders with Chelsea (another ancient manor) whether electoral or postal definitions are used, and has similar architecture. To the west, a border is clearly defined by the line of the Counter Creek marked by the West London railway line. To the north, the only obvious border line is Holland Park Avenue, to the north of which is the district of Notting Hill (another ancient manor), usually classed as within &quot;North Kensington&quot;.
In the north east is situated the large public Royal Park of Kensington Gardens (contiguous with its eastern neighbour, Hyde Park). The other main green area in Kensington is Holland Park, on the north side of the eastern end of Kensington High Street. Many residential roads have small communal garden squares, for the exclusive use of the residents.

The sub districts of Kensington: South Kensington and Earl&#x27;s Court also consist largely of private housing. North Kensington and West Kensington are largely devoid of features to attract the visitor.
Kensington is, in general, an extremely affluent area, a trait that it shares with Chelsea, its neighbour to the south. The area has some of London&#x27;s most expensive streets and garden squares, and at about the turn of the 21st century the Holland Park neighbourhood became particularly high-status. In early 2007 houses sold in Upper Phillimore Gardens, immediately east of Holland Park, for over £20 million. Brompton is another definable area of Kensington.

The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea forms part of the most densely populated local government district in the United Kingdom. This high density has come about through the subdivision of large mid-rise Georgian and Victorian terraced houses (generally of four to six floors) into flats. The less-affluent northern extremity of Kensington has high-rise residential buildings, while this type of building in the southern part is only represented by the Holiday Inn&#x27;s London Kensington Forum Hotel in Cromwell Road, a 27-storey building.

Notable attractions and institutions in Kensington include Kensington Palace in Kensington Gardens, the Royal Albert Hall opposite the Albert Memorial in Hyde Park, the Royal College of Music, the Natural History Museum, the Science Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum, Heythrop College, Imperial College, the Royal College of Art, and Kensington and Chelsea College. The Olympia Exhibition Hall is just over the western border in West Kensington.

==Administration==

Kensington is administered within the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, and lies within the Kensington parliamentary constituency.

==Media sector==

The head office of newspaper group DMGT is located in Northcliffe House off Kensington High Street in part of the large Barkers department store building. In addition to housing the offices for the DMGT newspapers &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, &quot;Mail on Sunday&quot; and &quot;Metro&quot;, Northcliffe House also accommodates the offices of the newspapers owned by Evgeny Lebedev: &quot;The Independent&quot;, &quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot;, and the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;. The &quot;i&quot; newspaper, sold to Johnston Press in 2016, is still produced from offices in Northcliffe House. Most of these titles were for many decades produced and printed in Fleet Street in the City of London.

The building also houses Lebedev&#x27;s TV channel London Live, with its news studio situated in part of the former department store, using St Mary Abbots church and Kensington Church Street as live backdrop.

==Transport==
Kensington is crossed east–west by three main roads, the most important of which is the A4 &quot;Cromwell Road&quot; which connects it to Central London on the east and to Hounslow and Heathrow Airport on the west. Parallel to the north is Kensington Road (of which Kensington High Street forms the eastern part), linking central London and Hammersmith and Hounslow to the area. To the south is Fulham Road, which connects South Kensington with Fulham to the south-west. North-south connections are not as well-developed and there is no obvious single north–south route through the area.

Kensington is well served by public transport. Most of Kensington is served by three stations in the Travelcard Zone 1: High Street Kensington, Gloucester Road and South Kensington. All three are served by the Circle line which connects them to London&#x27;s railway terminals. The District line also serves all three stations, albeit on different branches; it links the latter two to Westminster and the City. The Piccadilly line also links South Kensington and Gloucester Road to the West End in about 10 minutes, and in the other direction to Chiswick, Ealing, Hounslow and Heathrow Airport in around 20–40 minutes, depending on the area of choice. In addition Kensington (Olympia) in Travelcard Zone 2 serves the western part of Kensington, with District line trains to Earl&#x27;s Court and High Street Kensington. Nearby West Kensington station takes its name from the former boundaries with Hammersmith and is not in the Borough.

A number of local bus services link Kensington into the surrounding districts, and key hubs are Kensington High Street and South Kensington station. These bus services were improved in frequency and spread from 2007 until 2010 when the western extension of the London congestion charge area existed (which required drivers of cars and vans during the charging hours Monday-Friday to pay a daily fee of £8).

In 2020 a temporary cycle lane on Kensington High Street caused a nationwide media stir. The temporary cycle lane was installed by the local council in September 2020 with £700,000 in funding from central government grants, but it was removed in December 2020.

==Sports==
Kensington has one football team, Kensington Borough F.C., which currently plays in the Combined Counties Football League.

<text>A letter of marque and reprisal () was a government license in the Age of Sail that authorized a private person, known as a privateer or corsair, to attack and capture vessels of a foreign state at war with the issuer, licensing international military operations against a specified enemy as reprisal for a previous attack or injury. Captured naval prizes were judged before the government&#x27;s admiralty court for condemnation and transfer of ownership to the privateer. 

A common practice among Europeans from the late Middle Ages to the 19th century, cruising for enemy prizes with a letter of marque was considered an honorable calling that combined patriotism and profit. Such legally authorized privateering contrasted with unlicensed captures of random ships, known as piracy, which was universally condemned. In practice, the differences between privateers and pirates were sometimes slight, even merely a matter of interpretation.

The terms &quot;letter of marque&quot; and &quot;privateer&quot; were sometimes used to describe the ships which typically operated under the marque-and-reprisal licences. In this context, a letter of marque was a lumbering, square-rigged cargo carrier that might pick up a prize if the opportunity arose in its normal commerce. In contrast, the term privateer generally referred to a fighting vessel, fore-and-aft rigged, fast, and weatherly.

Letters of marque allowed governments to fight their wars using mercenary private captains and sailors in place of their own navies as a measure to save time and money. Instead of building, funding, and maintaining a navy in times of peace, governments would wait until the start of a war to issue letters of marque to privateers, who financed their own ships in expectation of prize money.

==Etymology and history of nomenclature==
Marque derives from the Old English &quot;mearc&quot;, which is from the Germanic *&quot;mark-&quot;, which means boundary, or boundary marker. This is derived from the Proto-Indo-European root &quot;*merǵ-&quot;, meaning boundary, or border. The French &quot;marque&quot; is from the Provençal language &quot;marca&quot;, which is from &quot;marcar&quot;, also Provençal, meaning to seize as a pledge.

According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, the first recorded use of &quot;letters of marque and reprisal&quot; was in an English statute in 1354 during the reign of King Edward III. The phrase referred to &quot;a licen[c]e granted by a sovereign to a subject, authorizing him to make reprisals on the subjects of a hostile state for injuries alleged to have been done to him by the enemy&#x27;s army&quot;.

==Early history==
During the Middle Ages, armed private vessels enjoying their sovereign&#x27;s tacit consent, if not always an explicit formal commission, regularly raided shipping of other states, as in the case of the English Sir Francis Drake&#x27;s attacks on Spanish shipping. Queen Elizabeth I (despite protestations of innocence) took a share of the prizes. Dutch jurist Hugo Grotius&#x27;s 1604 seminal work on international law, &quot;De Iure Praedae&quot; (&quot;Of The Law of Prize and Booty&quot;), was an advocate&#x27;s brief defending Dutch raids on Spanish and Portuguese shipping.

King Henry III of England first issued what later became known as privateering commissions in 1243. These early licences were granted to specific individuals to seize the King&#x27;s enemies at sea in return for splitting the proceeds between the privateers and the Crown.

The letter of marque and reprisal was documented in 1295, 50 years after wartime privateer licenses were first issued. According to Grotius, letters of marque and reprisal were akin to a &quot;private war&quot;, a concept alien to modern sensibilities but related to an age when the ocean was lawless and all merchant vessels sailed armed for self-defense. A reprisal involved seeking the sovereign&#x27;s permission to exact private retribution against some foreign prince or subject. The earliest instance of a licensed reprisal recorded in England was in the year 1295 under the reign of King Edward I. The notion of reprisal, and behind it that just war involved avenging a wrong, was associated with the letter of marque until 1620 in England. To apply for such a letter, a shipowner had to submit to the Admiralty Court an estimate of actual losses incurred.

Licensing privateers during wartime became widespread in Europe by the 16th century, when most countries began to enact laws regulating the granting of letters of marque and reprisal. Such business could be very profitable; during the eight years of the American Revolutionary War, ships from the tiny island of Guernsey carrying letter of marque captured French and American vessels to the value of £900,000 (). Privateers from Guernsey continued to operate during the Napoleonic Wars.

Although privateering commissions and letters of marque were originally distinct legal concepts, such distinctions became purely technical by the 18th century. Article I of the United States Constitution, for instance, states that &quot;The Congress shall have Power To ... grant Letters of marque and reprisal ...&quot;, without separately addressing privateer commissions.

During the American War of Independence, the Napoleonic Wars, and the War of 1812, it was common to distinguish verbally between privateers (also known as private ships of war) on the one hand, and armed merchantmen, which were referred to as &quot;letters of marque&quot;, on the other, though both received the same commission. The &quot;Sir John Sherbrooke&quot; (Halifax) was a privateer; the &quot;Sir John Sherbrooke&quot; (Saint John) was an armed merchantman. The East India Company arranged for letters of marque for its East Indiamen ships, such as the &quot;Lord Nelson&quot;. They did not need permission to carry cannons to fend off warships, privateers, and pirates on their voyages to India and China but, the letters of marque provided that, should they have the opportunity to take a prize, they could do so without being guilty of piracy. Similarly, the &quot;Earl of Mornington&quot;, an East India Company packet ship of only six guns, also carried a letter of marque.

Letters of marque and privateers are largely credited for the age of Elizabethan exploration, because privateers were used to explore the seas. Under the Crown, Sir Francis Drake, Sir Walter Raleigh, and Sir Martin Frobisher sailed the seas as privateers; their expedition reports helped shape the age of Elizabethan exploration.

In July 1793, the East Indiamen , &quot;Triton&quot;, and &quot;Warley&quot; participated in the capture of Pondichéry by maintaining a blockade of the port. Afterwards, while sailing to China, the same three East Indiamen participated in an action in the Straits of Malacca. They came upon a French frigate, with some six or seven British prizes, with a crew replenishing her water casks ashore. The three British vessels immediately gave chase. The frigate fled towards the Sunda Strait. The Indiamen were able to catch up with a number of the prizes, and, after a few cannon shots, were able to retake them. Had they not carried letters of marque, such behaviour might well have qualified as piracy. Similarly, on 10 November 1800, the East Indiaman &quot;Phoenix&quot; captured the French privateer &quot;General Malartic&quot;, under Jean-Marie Dutertre, an action made legal by a letter of marque. Additionally, vessels with a letter of marque were exempt from having to sail in convoy, and nominally their crew members were exempt, during a voyage, from impressment.

During the Napoleonic Wars, the &quot;Dart&quot; and &quot;Kitty&quot;, British privateers, spent some months off the coast of Sierra Leone hunting slave-trading vessels.

==Applying for, and legal effect of, a letter of marque==

The procedure for issuing letters of marque, and the issuing authority, varied by time and circumstance. In colonial British America, for instance, colonial governors issued such letters in the name of the Crown. During the American War of Independence, authorization shifted from individual state legislatures, followed by both the states and the Continental Congress, and lastly, after ratification of the Constitution, only Congress authorized and the President signed letters of marque. A shipowner applied for such a letter of marque by stating the name, description, tonnage, and force (armaments) of the vessel, the name and residence of the owner, and the intended number of crew, and tendered a bond promising strict observance of the country&#x27;s laws and treaties, and of international laws and customs. The United States granted the commission to the vessel, not to its captain, often for a limited time or specified area, and stated the enemy upon whom attacks were permitted. For example, during the Second Barbary War (1815), President James Madison authorized the brig &quot;Grand Turk&quot; (out of Salem, Massachusetts) to cruise against &quot;Algerine vessels, public or private, goods and effects, of or belonging to the Dey of Algiers&quot;. This particular commission was never put to use, as it was issued July 3, 1815, the same day the treaty was signed, ending the U.S. involvement in the war.

In Britain in the 18th century, the High Court of Admiralty issued Letters of Marque. It was customary for the proposed privateer to pay a deposit or bond, possibly £1,500 () as surety for good behaviour. The details of the ship, including tonnage, crew and weapons were recorded. The ownership of these ships was often split into shares. Prizes were assessed and valued with profits split in pre-agreed proportions among the government, the owners, and the captain and crew.

A letter of marque and reprisal in effect converted a private merchant vessel into a naval auxiliary. A commissioned privateer enjoyed the protection and was subject to the obligations of the laws of war. If captured, the crew was entitled to honorable treatment as prisoners of war, while without the licence they were deemed mere pirates &quot;at war with all the world,&quot; criminals who were properly hanged.

For this reason, enterprising maritime raiders commonly took advantage of &quot;flag of convenience&quot; letters of marque, shopping for cooperative governments to license and legitimize their depredations. French/Irishman Captain Luke Ryan and his lieutenants in just over two years commanded six vessels under the flags of three different countries and on opposite sides in the same war. Likewise the notorious Lafitte brothers in New Orleans cruised under letters of marque secured by bribery from corrupt officials of tenuous Central American governments, to cloak plunder with a thin veil of legality.

==Adjudicating captures, invalid letters of marque, or illegal cruelty==
The letter of marque by its terms required privateers to bring captured vessels and their cargoes before admiralty courts of their own or allied countries for condemnation. Applying the rules and customs of prize law, the courts decided whether the letter of marque was valid and current, and whether the captured vessel or its cargo in fact belonged to the enemy (not always easy, when flying false flags was common practice), and if so the prize and its cargo were &quot;condemned&quot;, to be sold at auction with the proceeds divided among the privateer&#x27;s owner and crew. A prize court&#x27;s formal condemnation was required to transfer title; otherwise the vessel&#x27;s previous owners might well reclaim her on her next voyage, and seek damages for the confiscated cargo.

Questions sometimes arose as to the legitimacy of a letter of marque, especially in cases of disputed sovereignty during civil wars or rebellions. Following the deposition of James II of England, for instance, the new Privy Council of England did not recognize the letters of marque issued by James while in exile in France, and prosecuted captured sailors operating under them as pirates.

During the American Civil War, Union authorities likewise attempted to prosecute Confederate privateers for the criminal act of piracy. When the Confederate privateer &quot;Savannah&quot; was captured in 1861, its crew was put on trial in New York. The Confederate government, however, threatened to execute captured Union soldiers in retaliation if any of the Confederate sailors were convicted and hanged, and the Union eventually agreed to treat Confederate privateers as prisoners of war. 

Privateers were also required by the terms of their letters of marque to obey the laws of war, honour treaty obligations (avoid attacking neutrals), and in particular to treat captives as courteously and kindly as they safely could. If they failed to live up to their obligations, the admiralty courts could — and did — revoke the letter of marque, refuse to award prize money, forfeit bonds, or even award tort (personal injury) damages against the privateer&#x27;s officers and crew.

==Abolition of privateering==

States often agreed by treaty to forgo privateering between them, as England and France repeatedly did starting with the diplomatic overtures of Edward III in 1324; privateering nonetheless recurred in every war between them for the next 500 years.

Benjamin Franklin had attempted to persuade the French to lead by example and stop issuing letters of marque to their corsairs, but the effort foundered when war loomed with Britain once again. The French Convention did forbid the practice, but it was reinstated after the Thermidorian Reaction, in August 1795; on 26 September 1797, the Ministry of the Navy was authorized to sell small ships to private parties for this purpose.

Finally, after the Congress of Paris at the end of the Crimean War, seven European states signed the Paris Declaration of 1856 renouncing privateering, and 45 more countries eventually joined them, which in effect abolished privateering worldwide. The United States was among a few countries that were not signatory to that declaration.

When the War of the Pacific started in 1879 Bolivia did not possess any ships, but on March 26, 1879, Bolivian President Hilarion Daza formally offered letters of marque to any ships willing to go to combat for Bolivia. Bolivia had not signed the Paris Declaration Respecting Maritime Law but the United States, Britain and France stood by the treaty and refused to accept the legality of Bolivia&#x27;s act. Since Bolivia did not have any ports because Chile had occupied them, and because Peru discouraged the use of Letters of Marque, the naval conflict was left to be resolved between Chile and Peru.

==20th century==
In December 1941 and the first months of 1942, Goodyear commercial L-class blimp &quot;Resolute&quot; operating out of Moffett Field in Sunnyvale, California, flew anti-submarine patrols. As the civilian crew was armed with a rifle, a persistent misconception arose that this made the ship a privateer and that she and sister commercial blimps were operated under letters of marque until the Navy took over operation. Without Congressional authorization, the Navy would not have been able to legally issue any letters of marque.

==21st-century American reconsideration of letters of marque==
Article I of the United States Constitution lists issuing letters of marque and reprisal in Section 8 as one of the enumerated powers of Congress, alongside the power to tax and to declare war. However, since the American Civil War, the United States as a matter of policy has consistently followed the terms of the 1856 Paris Declaration forbidding the practice. The United States has not legally commissioned any privateers since 1815, although the status of submarine-hunting Goodyear airships in the early days of World War II created significant confusion. Various accounts refer to airships &quot;Resolute&quot; and &quot;Volunteer&quot; as operating under a &quot;privateer status&quot;, but Congress never authorized a commission, nor did the President sign one.

The issue of marque and reprisal was raised before Congress after the September 11 attacks and again by Congressman Ron Paul on July 21, 2007. The attacks were defined as acts of &quot;air piracy&quot; and the &quot;Marque and Reprisal Act of 2001&quot; was introduced, which would have granted the president the authority to use letters of marque and reprisal against the specific terrorists, instead of warring against a foreign state. The terrorists were compared to pirates in that they are difficult to fight by traditional military means. On April 15, 2009, Paul also advocated the use of letters of marque to address the issue of Somali pirates operating in the Gulf of Aden. However, the bills Paul introduced were not enacted into law.

During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the United States Congress considered a bill to &quot;[authorize] the President to issue letters of marque and reprisal&quot; in order to seize yachts owned by Russian oligarchs.

US Senator Mike Lee and others have suggested consideration be given to the potential use of letters of marque and reprisal in efforts to curtail the presence of Mexican cartels.

<text>An interpretation of quantum mechanics is an attempt to explain how the mathematical theory of quantum mechanics might correspond to experienced reality. Quantum mechanics has held up to rigorous and extremely precise tests in an extraordinarily broad range of experiments. However, there exist a number of contending schools of thought over their interpretation. These views on interpretation differ on such fundamental questions as whether quantum mechanics is deterministic or stochastic, local or non-local, which elements of quantum mechanics can be considered real, and what the nature of measurement is, among other matters.

While some variation of the Copenhagen interpretation is commonly presented in textbooks, many other interpretations have been developed.
Despite nearly a century of debate and experiment, no consensus has been reached among physicists and philosophers of physics concerning which interpretation best &quot;represents&quot; reality.

== History ==

The definition of quantum theorists&#x27; terms, such as &quot;wave function&quot; and &quot;matrix mechanics&quot;, progressed through many stages. For instance, Erwin Schrödinger originally viewed the electron&#x27;s wave function as its charge density smeared across space, but Max Born reinterpreted the absolute square value of the wave function as the electron&#x27;s probability density distributed across space; the Born rule, as it is now called, matched experiment, whereas Schrödinger&#x27;s charge density view did not.

The views of several early pioneers of quantum mechanics, such as Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg, are often grouped together as the &quot;Copenhagen interpretation&quot;, though physicists and historians of physics have argued that this terminology obscures differences between the views so designated. Copenhagen-type ideas were never universally embraced, and challenges to a perceived Copenhagen orthodoxy gained increasing attention in the 1950s with the pilot-wave interpretation of David Bohm and the many-worlds interpretation of Hugh Everett III.

The physicist N. David Mermin once quipped, &quot;New interpretations appear every year. None ever disappear.&quot; As a rough guide to development of the mainstream view during the 1990s and 2000s, a &quot;snapshot&quot; of opinions was collected in a poll by Schlosshauer et al. at the &quot;Quantum Physics and the Nature of Reality&quot; conference of July 2011. The authors reference a similarly informal poll carried out by Max Tegmark at the &quot;Fundamental Problems in Quantum Theory&quot; conference in August 1997. The main conclusion of the authors is that &quot;the Copenhagen interpretation still reigns supreme&quot;, receiving the most votes in their poll (42%), besides the rise to mainstream notability of the many-worlds interpretations: &quot;The Copenhagen interpretation still reigns supreme here, especially if we lump it together with intellectual offsprings such as information-based interpretations and the quantum Bayesian interpretation. In Tegmark&#x27;s poll, the Everett interpretation received 17% of the vote, which is similar to the number of votes (18%) in our poll.&quot;

Some concepts originating from studies of interpretations have found more practical application in quantum information science.

== Nature ==

More or less, all interpretations of quantum mechanics share two qualities:
# They interpret a &quot;formalism&quot;—a set of equations and principles to generate predictions via input of initial conditions
# They interpret a &quot;phenomenology&quot;—a set of observations, including those obtained by empirical research and those obtained informally, such as humans&#x27; experience of an unequivocal world
Two qualities vary among interpretations:
# Epistemology—claims about the possibility, scope, and means toward relevant &quot;knowledge&quot; of the world
# Ontology—claims about what things, such as categories and entities, &quot;exist&quot; in the world
In the philosophy of science, the distinction between knowledge and reality is termed &quot;epistemic&quot; versus &quot;ontic&quot;. A general law can be seen as a generalisation of the &quot;regularity&quot; of outcomes (epistemic), whereas a causal mechanism may be thought of as determining or &quot;regulating&quot; outcomes (ontic). A phenomenon can be interpreted either as ontic or as epistemic. For instance, indeterminism may be attributed to limitations of human observation and perception (epistemic), or may be explained as intrinsic physical randomness (ontic). Confusing the epistemic with the ontic—if for example one were to presume that a general law actually &quot;governs&quot; outcomes, and that the statement of a regularity has the role of a causal mechanism—is a category mistake.

In a broad sense, scientific theory can be viewed as offering an approximately true description or explanation of the natural world (scientific realism) or as providing nothing more than an account of our knowledge of the natural world (antirealism). A realist stance sees the epistemic as giving us a window onto the ontic, whereas an antirealist stance sees the epistemic as providing only a logically consistent picture of the ontic. In the first half of the 20th Century, a key antirealist philosophy was logical positivism, which sought to exclude unobservable aspects of reality from scientific theory.

Since the 1950s antirealism has adopted a more modest approach, often in the form of instrumentalism, permitting talk of unobservables but ultimately discarding the very question of realism and positing scientific theory as a tool to help us make predictions, not to attain a deep metaphysical understanding of the world. The instrumentalist view is typified by David Mermin&#x27;s famous slogan: &quot;Shut up and calculate&quot; (which is often misattributed to Richard Feynman).

== Interpretive challenges ==

# Abstract, mathematical nature of quantum field theories: the mathematical structure of quantum mechanics is abstract and does not result in a single, clear interpretation of its quantities.
# Apparent indeterministic and irreversible processes: in classical field theory, a physical property at a given location in the field is readily derived. In most mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics, measurement (understood as an interaction with a given state) has a special role in the theory, as it is the sole process that can cause a nonunitary, irreversible evolution of the state.
# Role of the observer in determining outcomes. Copenhagen-type interpretations imply that the wavefunction is a calculational tool, and represents reality only immediately after a measurement performed by an observer. Everettian interpretations grant that all possible outcomes are real, and that measurement-type interactions cause a branching process in which each possibility is realised.
# Classically unexpected correlations between remote objects: entangled quantum systems, as illustrated in the EPR paradox, obey statistics that seem to violate principles of local causality by action at a distance.
# Complementarity of proffered descriptions: complementarity holds that no set of classical physical concepts can simultaneously refer to all properties of a quantum system. For instance, wave description &quot;A&quot; and particulate description &quot;B&quot; can each describe quantum system &quot;S&quot;, but not simultaneously. This implies the composition of physical properties of &quot;S&quot; does not obey the rules of classical propositional logic when using propositional connectives (see &quot;Quantum logic&quot;). Like contextuality, the &quot;origin of complementarity lies in the non-commutativity of operators&quot; that describe quantum objects.
# Rapidly rising intricacy, far exceeding humans&#x27; present calculational capacity, as a system&#x27;s size increases: since the state space of a quantum system is exponential in the number of subsystems, it is difficult to derive classical approximations.
# Contextual behaviour of systems locally: Quantum contextuality demonstrates that classical intuitions, in which properties of a system hold definite values independent of the manner of their measurement, fail even for local systems. Also, physical principles such as Leibniz&#x27;s Principle of the identity of indiscernibles no longer apply in the quantum domain, signaling that most classical intuitions may be incorrect about the quantum world.

== Influential interpretations ==
=== Copenhagen interpretation ===
The Copenhagen interpretation is a collection of views about the meaning of quantum mechanics principally attributed to Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg. It is one of the oldest attitudes towards quantum mechanics, as features of it date to the development of quantum mechanics during 1925–1927, and it remains one of the most commonly taught. There is no definitive historical statement of what is &quot;the&quot; Copenhagen interpretation, and there were in particular fundamental disagreements between the views of Bohr and Heisenberg. For example, Heisenberg emphasized a sharp &quot;cut&quot; between the observer (or the instrument) and the system being observed, while Bohr offered an interpretation that is independent of a subjective observer or measurement or collapse, which relies on an &quot;irreversible&quot; or effectively irreversible process that imparts the classical behavior of &quot;observation&quot; or &quot;measurement&quot;.

Features common to Copenhagen-type interpretations include the idea that quantum mechanics is intrinsically indeterministic, with probabilities calculated using the Born rule, and the principle of complementarity, which states certain pairs of complementary properties cannot all be observed or measured simultaneously. Moreover, properties only result from the act of &quot;observing&quot; or &quot;measuring&quot;; the theory avoids assuming definite values from unperformed experiments. Copenhagen-type interpretations hold that quantum descriptions are objective, in that they are independent of physicists&#x27; mental arbitrariness. The statistical interpretation of wavefunctions due to Max Born differs sharply from Schrödinger&#x27;s original intent, which was to have a theory with continuous time evolution and in which wavefunctions directly described physical reality.

=== Many worlds ===
The many-worlds interpretation is an interpretation of quantum mechanics in which a universal wavefunction obeys the same deterministic, reversible laws at all times; in particular there is no (indeterministic and irreversible) wavefunction collapse associated with measurement. The phenomena associated with measurement are claimed to be explained by decoherence, which occurs when states interact with the environment. More precisely, the parts of the wavefunction describing observers become increasingly entangled with the parts of the wavefunction describing their experiments. Although all possible outcomes of experiments continue to lie in the wavefunction&#x27;s support, the times at which they become correlated with observers effectively &quot;split&quot; the universe into mutually unobservable alternate histories.

=== Quantum information theories ===
Quantum informational approaches have attracted growing support. They subdivide into two kinds.
* Information ontologies, such as J. A. Wheeler&#x27;s &quot;it from bit&quot;. These approaches have been described as a revival of immaterialism.
* Interpretations where quantum mechanics is said to describe an observer&#x27;s knowledge of the world, rather than the world itself. This approach has some similarity with Bohr&#x27;s thinking. Collapse (also known as reduction) is often interpreted as an observer acquiring information from a measurement, rather than as an objective event. These approaches have been appraised as similar to instrumentalism. James Hartle writes,

The state is not an objective property of an individual system but is that information, obtained from a knowledge of how a system was prepared, which can be used for making predictions about future measurements. ... A quantum mechanical state being a summary of the observer&#x27;s information about an individual physical system changes both by dynamical laws, and whenever the observer acquires new information about the system through the process of measurement. The existence of two laws for the evolution of the state vector ... becomes problematical only if it is believed that the state vector is an objective property of the system ... The &quot;reduction of the wavepacket&quot; does take place in the consciousness of the observer, not because of any unique physical process which takes place there, but only because the state is a construct of the observer and not an objective property of the physical system.
=== Relational quantum mechanics ===
The essential idea behind relational quantum mechanics, following the precedent of special relativity, is that different observers may give different accounts of the same series of events: for example, to one observer at a given point in time, a system may be in a single, &quot;collapsed&quot; eigenstate, while to another observer at the same time, it may be in a superposition of two or more states. Consequently, if quantum mechanics is to be a complete theory, relational quantum mechanics argues that the notion of &quot;state&quot; describes not the observed system itself, but the relationship, or correlation, between the system and its observer(s). The state vector of conventional quantum mechanics becomes a description of the correlation of some &quot;degrees of freedom&quot; in the observer, with respect to the observed system. However, it is held by relational quantum mechanics that this applies to all physical objects, whether or not they are conscious or macroscopic. Any &quot;measurement event&quot; is seen simply as an ordinary physical interaction, an establishment of the sort of correlation discussed above. Thus the physical content of the theory has to do not with objects themselves, but the relations between them.

=== QBism ===
QBism, which originally stood for &quot;quantum Bayesianism&quot;, is an interpretation of quantum mechanics that takes an agent&#x27;s actions and experiences as the central concerns of the theory. This interpretation is distinguished by its use of a subjective Bayesian account of probabilities to understand the quantum mechanical Born rule as a normative addition to good decision-making. QBism draws from the fields of quantum information and Bayesian probability and aims to eliminate the interpretational conundrums that have beset quantum theory.

QBism deals with common questions in the interpretation of quantum theory about the nature of wavefunction superposition, quantum measurement, and entanglement. According to QBism, many, but not all, aspects of the quantum formalism are subjective in nature. For example, in this interpretation, a quantum state is not an element of reality—instead it represents the degrees of belief an agent has about the possible outcomes of measurements. For this reason, some philosophers of science have deemed QBism a form of anti-realism. The originators of the interpretation disagree with this characterization, proposing instead that the theory more properly aligns with a kind of realism they call &quot;participatory realism&quot;, wherein reality consists of &quot;more&quot; than can be captured by any putative third-person account of it.

=== Consistent histories ===
The consistent histories interpretation generalizes the conventional Copenhagen interpretation and attempts to provide a natural interpretation of quantum cosmology. The theory is based on a consistency criterion that allows the history of a system to be described so that the probabilities for each history obey the additive rules of classical probability. It is claimed to be consistent with the Schrödinger equation.

According to this interpretation, the purpose of a quantum-mechanical theory is to predict the relative probabilities of various alternative histories (for example, of a particle).

=== Ensemble interpretation ===
The ensemble interpretation, also called the statistical interpretation, can be viewed as a minimalist interpretation. That is, it claims to make the fewest assumptions associated with the standard mathematics. It takes the statistical interpretation of Born to the fullest extent. The interpretation states that the wave function does not apply to an individual systemfor example, a single particlebut is an abstract statistical quantity that only applies to an ensemble (a vast multitude) of similarly prepared systems or particles. In the words of Einstein:

The most prominent current advocate of the ensemble interpretation is Leslie E. Ballentine, professor at Simon Fraser University, author of the text book &quot;Quantum Mechanics, A Modern Development&quot;.

=== De Broglie–Bohm theory ===
The de Broglie–Bohm theory of quantum mechanics (also known as the pilot wave theory) is a theory by Louis de Broglie and extended later by David Bohm to include measurements. Particles, which always have positions, are guided by the wavefunction. The wavefunction evolves according to the Schrödinger wave equation, and the wavefunction never collapses. The theory takes place in a single spacetime, is non-local, and is deterministic. The simultaneous determination of a particle&#x27;s position and velocity is subject to the usual uncertainty principle constraint. The theory is considered to be a hidden-variable theory, and by embracing non-locality it satisfies Bell&#x27;s inequality. The measurement problem is resolved, since the particles have definite positions at all times. Collapse is explained as phenomenological.

=== Transactional interpretation ===

The transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics (TIQM) by John G. Cramer is an interpretation of quantum mechanics inspired by the Wheeler–Feynman absorber theory. It describes the collapse of the wave function as resulting from a time-symmetric transaction between a possibility wave from the source to the receiver (the wave function) and a possibility wave from the receiver to source (the complex conjugate of the wave function). This interpretation of quantum mechanics is unique in that it not only views the wave function as a real entity, but the complex conjugate of the wave function, which appears in the Born rule for calculating the expected value for an observable, as also real.

=== Von Neumann–Wigner interpretation ===

In his treatise &quot;The Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics&quot;, John von Neumann deeply analyzed the so-called measurement problem. He concluded that the entire physical universe could be made subject to the Schrödinger equation (the universal wave function). He also described how measurement could cause a collapse of the wave function. This point of view was prominently expanded on by Eugene Wigner, who argued that human experimenter consciousness (or maybe even dog consciousness) was critical for the collapse, but he later abandoned this interpretation.

However, consciousness remains a mystery. The origin and place in nature of consciousness are not well understood. Some specific proposals for consciousness caused wave-function collapse have been shown to be unfalsifiable.

=== Quantum logic ===
Quantum logic can be regarded as a kind of propositional logic suitable for understanding the apparent anomalies regarding quantum measurement, most notably those concerning composition of measurement operations of complementary variables. This research area and its name originated in the 1936 paper by Garrett Birkhoff and John von Neumann, who attempted to reconcile some of the apparent inconsistencies of classical Boolean logic with the facts related to measurement and observation in quantum mechanics.

=== Modal interpretations of quantum theory ===
Modal interpretations of quantum mechanics were first conceived of in 1972 by Bas van Fraassen, in his paper &quot;A formal approach to the philosophy of science&quot;. Van Fraassen introduced a distinction between a &quot;dynamical&quot; state, which describes what might be true about a system and which always evolves according to the Schrödinger equation, and a &quot;value&quot; state, which indicates what is actually true about a system at a given time. The term &quot;modal interpretation&quot; now is used to describe a larger set of models that grew out of this approach. The &quot;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&quot; describes several versions, including proposals by Kochen, Dieks, Clifton, Dickson, and Bub. According to Michel Bitbol, Schrödinger&#x27;s views on how to interpret quantum mechanics progressed through as many as four stages, ending with a non-collapse view that in respects resembles the interpretations of Everett and van Fraassen. Because Schrödinger subscribed to a kind of post-Machian neutral monism, in which &quot;matter&quot; and &quot;mind&quot; are only different aspects or arrangements of the same common elements, treating the wavefunction as ontic and treating it as epistemic became interchangeable.

=== Time-symmetric theories ===
Time-symmetric interpretations of quantum mechanics were first suggested by Walter Schottky in 1921. Several theories have been proposed that modify the equations of quantum mechanics to be symmetric with respect to time reversal. (See Wheeler–Feynman time-symmetric theory.) This creates retrocausality: events in the future can affect ones in the past, exactly as events in the past can affect ones in the future. In these theories, a single measurement cannot fully determine the state of a system (making them a type of hidden-variables theory), but given two measurements performed at different times, it is possible to calculate the exact state of the system at all intermediate times. The collapse of the wavefunction is therefore not a physical change to the system, just a change in our knowledge of it due to the second measurement. Similarly, they explain entanglement as not being a true physical state but just an illusion created by ignoring retrocausality. The point where two particles appear to &quot;become entangled&quot; is simply a point where each particle is being influenced by events that occur to the other particle in the future.

Not all advocates of time-symmetric causality favour modifying the unitary dynamics of standard quantum mechanics. Thus a leading exponent of the two-state vector formalism, Lev Vaidman, states that the two-state vector formalism dovetails well with Hugh Everett&#x27;s many-worlds interpretation.

=== Other interpretations ===

As well as the mainstream interpretations discussed above, a number of other interpretations have been proposed that have not made a significant scientific impact for whatever reason. These range from proposals by mainstream physicists to the more occult ideas of quantum mysticism.

== Related concepts ==
Some ideas are discussed in the context of interpreting quantum mechanics but are not necessarily regarded as interpretations themselves.

=== Quantum Darwinism ===

Quantum Darwinism is a theory meant to explain the emergence of the classical world from the quantum world as due to a process of Darwinian natural selection induced by the environment interacting with the quantum system; where the many possible quantum states are selected against in favor of a stable pointer state. It was proposed in 2003 by Wojciech Zurek and a group of collaborators including Ollivier, Poulin, Paz and Blume-Kohout. The development of the theory is due to the integration of a number of Zurek&#x27;s research topics pursued over the course of twenty-five years including pointer states, einselection and decoherence.

=== Objective-collapse theories ===

Objective-collapse theories differ from the Copenhagen interpretation by regarding both the wave function and the process of collapse as ontologically objective (meaning these exist and occur independent of the observer). In objective theories, collapse occurs either randomly (&quot;spontaneous localization&quot;) or when some physical threshold is reached, with observers having no special role. Thus, objective-collapse theories are realistic, indeterministic, no-hidden-variables theories. Standard quantum mechanics does not specify any mechanism of collapse; quantum mechanics would need to be extended if objective collapse is correct. The requirement for an extension means that objective-collapse theories are alternatives to quantum mechanics rather than interpretations of it. Examples include 
* the Ghirardi–Rimini–Weber theory
* the continuous spontaneous localization model
* the Penrose interpretation

== Comparisons ==
The most common interpretations are summarized in the table below. The values shown in the cells of the table are not without controversy, for the precise meanings of some of the concepts involved are unclear and, in fact, are themselves at the center of the controversy surrounding the given interpretation. For another table comparing interpretations of quantum theory, see reference.

No experimental evidence exists that distinguishes among these interpretations. To that extent, the physical theory stands, and is consistent with itself and with reality. Nevertheless, designing experiments that would test the various interpretations is the subject of active research.

Most of these interpretations have variants. For example, it is difficult to get a precise definition of the Copenhagen interpretation as it was developed and argued by many people.


== The silent approach ==

Although interpretational opinions are openly and widely discussed today, that was not always the case. A notable exponent of a tendency of silence was Paul Dirac who once wrote: &quot;The interpretation of quantum mechanics has been dealt with by many authors, and I do not want to discuss it here. I want to deal with more fundamental things.&quot; This position is not uncommon among practitioners of quantum mechanics. 
Similarly Richard Feynman wrote many popularizations of quantum mechanics without ever publishing about interpretation issues like quantum measurement. 
Others, like Nico van Kampen and Willis Lamb, have openly criticized non-orthodox interpretations of quantum mechanics.

<text>The Antoinette Perry Award for Excellence in Broadway Theatre, more commonly known as a Tony Award, recognizes excellence in live Broadway theatre. The awards are presented by the American Theatre Wing and The Broadway League at an annual ceremony in Manhattan. The ceremony is usually held in June.

The awards are given for Broadway productions and performances. One is also given for regional theatre. Several discretionary non-competitive awards are given as well, including a Special Tony Award, the Tony Honors for Excellence in Theatre, and the Isabelle Stevenson Award.
The awards were founded by theatre producer and director Brock Pemberton. They are named after Antoinette &quot;Tony&quot; Perry, an actress, producer and theatre director who was co-founder and secretary of the American Theatre Wing. The trophy consists of a spinnable medallion, with faces portraying an adaptation of the comedy and tragedy masks, mounted on a black base with a pewter swivel.

The rules for the Tony Awards are set forth in the official document &quot;Rules and Regulations of The American Theatre Wing&#x27;s Tony Awards&quot;, which applies for that season only. The Tony Awards are the New York theatre industry&#x27;s equivalent to the Emmy Awards for television, the Grammy Awards for music, and the Academy Awards (Oscars) for film. A person who has won all four is said to have won the EGOT. The Tony Awards are the U.S. equivalent of the United Kingdom&#x27;s Laurence Olivier Awards and France&#x27;s Molière Awards.

==Award categories==
, there were 26 categories of awards, in addition to several special awards. Starting with 11 awards in 1947, the names and number of categories have changed over the years. Some examples: the category Best Book of a Musical was originally called &quot;Best Author (Musical)&quot;. The category of Best Costume Design was one of the original awards. For two years, in 1960 and 1961, this category was split into Best Costume Designer (Dramatic) and Best Costume Designer (Musical). It then went to a single category, but in 2005 it was divided again. For the category of Best Director of a Play, a single category was for directors of plays and musicals prior to 1960.

A newly established non-competitive award, The Isabelle Stevenson Award, was given for the first time at the awards ceremony in 2009. The award is for an individual who has made a &quot;substantial contribution of volunteered time and effort on behalf of one or more humanitarian, social service or charitable organizations.&quot;

The category of Best Special Theatrical Event was retired as of the 2009–2010 season. The categories of Best Sound Design of a Play and Best Sound Design of a Musical were retired as of the 2014–2015 season. On April 24, 2017, the Tony Awards administration committee announced that the Sound Design Award would be reintroduced for the 2017–2018 season.

==History==

The award was founded in 1947 by a committee of the American Theatre Wing (ATW), headed by Brock Pemberton. The award is named after Antoinette Perry, nicknamed Tony, an actress, director, producer and co-founder of the American Theatre Wing, who died in 1946. As her official biography at the Tony Awards website states, &quot;At [Warner Bros. story editor] Jacob Wilk&#x27;s suggestion, [Pemberton] proposed an award in her honor for distinguished stage acting and technical achievement. At the initial event in 1947, as he handed out an award, he called it a Tony. The name stuck.&quot; Nevertheless, the awards were sometimes referred to as the &quot;Perry Awards&quot; in their early years.

The 1st Tony Awards was held on April 6, 1947, at the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York City. The first prizes were &quot;a scroll, cigarette lighter and articles of jewelry such as 14-carat gold compacts and bracelets for the women, and money clips for the men&quot;. ATW co-founder Louise Heims Beck was responsible for overseeing the organization of the first awards. It was not until the third awards ceremony in 1949 that the first Tony medallion was given to award winners.

Since 1967, the award ceremony has been broadcast on U.S. national television and includes songs from the nominated musicals, and occasionally has included video clips of, or presentations about, nominated plays. The American Theatre Wing and The Broadway League jointly present and administer the awards. Audience size for the telecast is generally well below that of the Academy Awards shows, but the program reaches an affluent audience, which is prized by advertisers. According to a June 2003 article in &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;What the Tony broadcast does have, say CBS officials, is an all-important demographic: rich and smart. Jack Sussman, CBS&#x27;s senior vice president in charge of specials, said the Tony show sold almost all its advertising slots shortly after CBS announced it would present the three hours. &#x27;It draws upscale premium viewers who are attractive to upscale premium advertisers,&#x27; Mr. Sussman said...&quot; The viewership has declined from the early years of its broadcast history (for example, the number of viewers in 1974 was 20 million; in 1999, 9.2 million) but has settled into between six and eight million viewers for most of the decade of the 2000s. In contrast, the 2009 Oscar telecast had 36.3 million viewers.

=== Medallion ===
The Tony Award medallion was designed by art director Herman Rosse and is a mix of mostly brass and a little bronze, with a nickel plating on the outside; a black acrylic glass base, and the nickel-plated pewter swivel. The face of the medallion portrays an adaptation of the comedy and tragedy masks. Originally, the reverse side had a relief profile of Antoinette Perry; this later was changed to contain the winner&#x27;s name, award category, production and year. The medallion has been mounted on a black base since 1967.

A larger base was introduced and first presented in the 2010 award ceremony. That base is slightly taller , up from and heavier , up from . This change was implemented to make the award &quot;feel more substantial&quot; and easier to handle at the moment the award is presented to the winners, according to Howard Sherman, the executive director of the American Theatre Wing:

For the specific Tony Awards presented to a Broadway production, awards are given to the author and up to two of the producers free of charge. All other members of the above-the-title producing team are eligible to purchase the physical award. Sums collected are designed to help defray the cost of the Tony Awards ceremony itself. An award cost $400 as of at least 2000, $750 as of at least 2009, and, as of 2013, had been $2,500 &quot;for several years&quot;, according to Tony Award Productions.

==Details of the Tony Awards==
&quot;Source: Tony Awards Official Site, Rules&quot;

===Rules for a new play or musical===
For the purposes of the award, a new play or musical is one that has not previously been produced on Broadway and is not &quot;determined… to be a &#x27;classic&#x27; or in the historical or popular repertoire&quot;, as determined by the Administration Committee (per Section (2g) of the Rules and Regulations). The rule about &quot;classic&quot; productions was instituted by the Tony Award Administration Committee in 2002, and stated (in summary) &quot;A play or musical that is determined ... to be a &#x27;classic&#x27; or in the historical or popular repertoire shall not be eligible for an award in the Best Play or Best Musical Category but may be eligible in that appropriate Best Revival category.&quot; Shows transferred from Off-Broadway or the West End are eligible as &quot;new&quot;, as are productions based closely on films.

This rule has been the subject of some controversy, as some shows, such as &quot;Hedwig and the Angry Inch&quot; and &quot;Violet&quot;, have been ruled ineligible for the &quot;new&quot; category, meaning that their authors did not have a chance to win the important awards of Best Play or Best Musical (or Best Score or Best Book for musicals). On the other hand, some people feel that allowing plays and musicals that have been frequently produced to be eligible as &quot;new&quot; gives them an unfair advantage because they will have benefited from additional development time as well as additional familiarity with the Tony voters.

===Committees and voters===
The Tony Awards Administration Committee has twenty-four members: ten designated by the American Theatre Wing, ten by The Broadway League, and one each by the Dramatists Guild, Actors&#x27; Equity Association, United Scenic Artists and the Society of Stage Directors and Choreographers. This committee, among other duties, determines eligibility for nominations in all awards categories.

The Tony Awards Nominating Committee makes the nominations for the various categories. This rotating group of theatre professionals is selected by the Tony Awards Administration Committee. Nominators serve three-year terms and are asked to see every new Broadway production. The Nominating Committee for the 2012–13 Broadway season (named in June 2012) had 42 members; the Nominating Committee for the 2014–2015 season has 50 members and was appointed in June 2014.

There are approximately 868 eligible Tony Award voters (as of 2014), a number that changes slightly from year to year. The number was decreased in 2009 when the first-night critics were excluded as voters. That decision was changed, and members of the New York Drama Critics&#x27; Circle were invited to be Tony voters beginning in the 2010–2011 season.

The eligible Tony voters include the board of directors and designated members of the advisory committee of the American Theatre Wing, members of the governing boards of Actors&#x27; Equity Association, the Dramatists Guild, the Society of Stage Directors and Choreographers, United Scenic Artists, and the Association of Theatrical Press Agents and Managers, members of the Theatrical Council of the Casting Society of America and voting members of The Broadway League (in 2000, what was then The League of American Theaters and Producers changed membership eligibility and Tony voting status from a lifetime honor to all above-the-title producers, to ones who had been active in the previous 10 years. This action disenfranchised scores of Tony voters, including Gail Berman, Harve Brosten, Dick Button, Tony Lo Bianco, and Raymond Serra).

===Eligibility date (Season)===
To be eligible for Tony Award consideration, a production must have officially opened on Broadway by the eligibility date that the Management Committee establishes each year. For example, the cut-off date for eligibility the 2013–2014 season was April 24, 2014. The season for Tony Award eligibility is defined in the Rules and Regulations.

In 2020, the 74th Annual Tony Awards were postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On August 21, 2020, it was announced that the 74th Annual Tony Awards would take place digitally later in 2020.

===Broadway theatre===
A Broadway theatre is defined as having 500 or more seats, among other requirements. While the rules define a Broadway theatre in terms of its size, not its geographical location, the list of Broadway theatres is determined solely by the Tony Awards Administration Committee. As of the 2016–2017 season, the list consisted solely of 41 theaters: 40 located in the vicinity of Times Square in New York City and Lincoln Center&#x27;s Vivian Beaumont Theater.

== Criticism ==
While the theatre-going public may consider the Tony Awards to be the Oscars of live theatre, critics have suggested that the Tony Awards are primarily a promotional vehicle for a small number of large production companies and theatre owners in New York City. In a 2014 &quot;Playbill&quot; article, Robert Simonson wrote that &quot;Who gets to perform on the Tony Awards broadcast, what they get to perform, and for how long, have long been politically charged questions in the Broadway theatre community...&quot; The producers &quot;accept the situation ... because just as much as actually winning a Tony, a performance that lands well with the viewing public can translate into big box-office sales.&quot; Producer Robyn Goodman noted that, if the presentation at the ceremony shows well and the show wins a Tony, &quot;you&#x27;re going to spike at the box office&quot;.

The awards met further criticism when they eliminated the sound design awards in 2014. In 2014, a petition calling for the return of the Sound Design categories received more than 30,000 signatures. Addressing their previous concerns over Tony voters in the category, it was announced that upon the awards&#x27; return for the 2017–2018 season, they would be decided by a subset of voters based on their expertise.

Some advocates of gender equality and non-binary people have criticized the separation of male and female acting categories in the Tony Awards, Academy Awards, and Emmy Awards. Though some commentators worry that gender discrimination would cause men to dominate unsegregated categories, other categories are unsegregated. The Grammy Awards went gender-neutral in 2012, while the Daytime Emmy Awards introduced a single Outstanding Younger Performer in a Drama Series category in 2019 to replace their two gender-specific younger actor and actress categories. In 2023, J. Harrison Ghee and Alex Newell became the first nonbinary actors to be nominated for Tony Awards. Both would go on to win in their respective categories. Fellow nonbinary performer Justin David Sullivan withdrew from Tony consideration due to the gendered categories.

<doc id="54743" wikidata="Q38978" url="?curid=54743" title="Inbreeding">
<text>Inbreeding is the production of offspring from the mating or breeding of individuals or organisms that are closely related genetically. By analogy, the term is used in human reproduction, but more commonly refers to the genetic disorders and other consequences that may arise from expression of recessive traits resulting from incestuous sexual relationships and consanguinity. Animals avoid inbreeding only rarely.

Inbreeding results in homozygosity which can increase the chances of offspring being affected by recessive traits. In extreme cases, this usually leads to at least temporarily decreased biological fitness of a population (called inbreeding depression), which is its ability to survive and reproduce. An individual who inherits such deleterious traits is colloquially referred to as &quot;inbred&quot;. The avoidance of expression of such deleterious recessive alleles caused by inbreeding, via inbreeding avoidance mechanisms, is the main selective reason for outcrossing. Crossbreeding between populations sometimes has positive effects on fitness-related traits, but also sometimes leads to negative effects known as outbreeding depression. However, increased homozygosity increases the probability of fixing beneficial alleles and also slightly decreases the probability of fixing deleterious alleles in a population. Inbreeding can result in purging of deleterious alleles from a population through purifying selection.

Inbreeding is a technique used in selective breeding. For example, in livestock breeding, breeders may use inbreeding when trying to establish a new and desirable trait in the stock and for producing distinct families within a breed, but will need to watch for undesirable characteristics in offspring, which can then be eliminated through further selective breeding or culling. Inbreeding also helps to ascertain the type of gene action affecting a trait. Inbreeding is also used to reveal deleterious recessive alleles, which can then be eliminated through assortative breeding or through culling. In plant breeding, inbred lines are used as stocks for the creation of hybrid lines to make use of the effects of heterosis. Inbreeding in plants also occurs naturally in the form of self-pollination.

Inbreeding can significantly influence gene expression which can prevent inbreeding depression.

==Overview==
Offspring of biologically related persons are subject to the possible effects of inbreeding, such as congenital birth defects. The chances of such disorders are increased when the biological parents are more closely related. This is because such pairings have a 25% probability of producing homozygous zygotes, resulting in offspring with two recessive alleles, which can produce disorders when these alleles are deleterious. Because most recessive alleles are rare in populations, it is unlikely that two unrelated partners will both be carriers of the same deleterious allele; however, because close relatives share a large fraction of their alleles, the probability that any such deleterious allele is inherited from the common ancestor through both parents is increased dramatically. For each homozygous recessive individual formed there is an equal chance of producing a homozygous dominant individual — one completely devoid of the harmful allele. Contrary to common belief, inbreeding does not in itself alter allele frequencies, but rather increases the relative proportion of homozygotes to heterozygotes; however, because the increased proportion of deleterious homozygotes exposes the allele to natural selection, in the long run its frequency decreases more rapidly in inbred populations. In the short term, incestuous reproduction is expected to increase the number of spontaneous abortions of zygotes, perinatal deaths, and postnatal offspring with birth defects. The advantages of inbreeding may be the result of a tendency to preserve the structures of alleles interacting at different loci that have been adapted together by a common selective history.

Malformations or harmful traits can stay within a population due to a high homozygosity rate, and this will cause a population to become fixed for certain traits, like having too many bones in an area, like the vertebral column of wolves on Isle Royale or having cranial abnormalities, such as in Northern elephant seals, where their cranial bone length in the lower mandibular tooth row has changed. Having a high homozygosity rate is problematic for a population because it will unmask recessive deleterious alleles generated by mutations, reduce heterozygote advantage, and it is detrimental to the survival of small, endangered animal populations. When deleterious recessive alleles are unmasked due to the increased homozygosity generated by inbreeding, this can cause inbreeding depression.

There may also be other deleterious effects besides those caused by recessive diseases. Thus, similar immune systems may be more vulnerable to infectious diseases (see Major histocompatibility complex and sexual selection).

Inbreeding history of the population should also be considered when discussing the variation in the severity of inbreeding depression between and within species. With persistent inbreeding, there is evidence that shows that inbreeding depression becomes less severe. This is associated with the unmasking and elimination of severely deleterious recessive alleles. However, inbreeding depression is not a temporary phenomenon because this elimination of deleterious recessive alleles will never be complete. Eliminating slightly deleterious mutations through inbreeding under moderate selection is not as effective. Fixation of alleles most likely occurs through Muller&#x27;s ratchet, when an asexual population&#x27;s genome accumulates deleterious mutations that are irreversible.

Despite all its disadvantages, inbreeding can also have a variety of advantages, such as ensuring a child produced from the mating contains, and will pass on, a higher percentage of its mother/father&#x27;s genetics, reducing the recombination load, and allowing the expression of recessive advantageous phenotypes. Some species with a Haplodiploidy mating system depend on the ability to produce sons to mate with as a means of ensuring a mate can be found if no other male is available. It has been proposed that under circumstances when the advantages of inbreeding outweigh the disadvantages, preferential breeding within small groups could be promoted, potentially leading to speciation.

==Genetic disorders==

Autosomal recessive disorders occur in individuals who have two copies of an allele for a particular recessive genetic mutation. Except in certain rare circumstances, such as new mutations or uniparental disomy, both parents of an individual with such a disorder will be carriers of the gene. These carriers do not display any signs of the mutation and may be unaware that they carry the mutated gene. Since relatives share a higher proportion of their genes than do unrelated people, it is more likely that related parents will both be carriers of the same recessive allele, and therefore their children are at a higher risk of inheriting an autosomal recessive genetic disorder. The extent to which the risk increases depends on the degree of genetic relationship between the parents; the risk is greater when the parents are close relatives and lower for relationships between more distant relatives, such as second cousins, though still greater than for the general population.

Children of parent-child or sibling-sibling unions are at an increased risk compared to cousin-cousin unions. Inbreeding may result in a greater than expected phenotypic expression of deleterious recessive alleles within a population. As a result, first-generation inbred individuals are more likely to show physical and health defects, including:

The isolation of a small population for a period of time can lead to inbreeding within that population, resulting in increased genetic relatedness between breeding individuals. Inbreeding depression can also occur in a large population if individuals tend to mate with their relatives, instead of mating randomly.

Due to higher prenatal and postnatal mortality rates, some individuals in the first generation of inbreeding will not live on to reproduce. Over time, with isolation, such as a population bottleneck caused by purposeful (assortative) breeding or natural environmental factors, the deleterious inherited traits are culled.

Island species are often very inbred, as their isolation from the larger group on a mainland allows natural selection to work on their population. This type of isolation may result in the formation of race or even speciation, as the inbreeding first removes many deleterious genes, and permits the expression of genes that allow a population to adapt to an ecosystem. As the adaptation becomes more pronounced, the new species or race radiates from its entrance into the new space, or dies out if it cannot adapt and, most importantly, reproduce.

The reduced genetic diversity, for example due to a bottleneck will unavoidably increase inbreeding for the entire population. This may mean that a species may not be able to adapt to changes in environmental conditions. Each individual will have similar immune systems, as immune systems are genetically based. When a species becomes endangered, the population may fall below a minimum whereby the forced interbreeding between the remaining animals will result in extinction.

Natural breedings include inbreeding by necessity, and most animals only migrate when necessary. In many cases, the closest available mate is a mother, sister, grandmother, father, brother, or grandfather. In all cases, the environment presents stresses to remove from the population those individuals who cannot survive because of illness.

There was an assumption that wild populations do not inbreed; this is not what is observed in some cases in the wild. However, in species such as horses, animals in wild or feral conditions often drive off the young of both sexes, thought to be a mechanism by which the species instinctively avoids some of the genetic consequences of inbreeding. In general, many mammal species, including humanity&#x27;s closest primate relatives, avoid close inbreeding possibly due to the deleterious effects.

===Examples===
Although there are several examples of inbred populations of wild animals, the negative consequences of this inbreeding are poorly documented. In the South American sea lion, there was concern that recent population crashes would reduce genetic diversity. Historical analysis indicated that a population expansion from just two matrilineal lines was responsible for most of the individuals within the population. Even so, the diversity within the lines allowed great variation in the gene pool that may help to protect the South American sea lion from extinction.

In lions, prides are often followed by related males in bachelor groups. When the dominant male is killed or driven off by one of these bachelors, a father may be replaced by his son. There is no mechanism for preventing inbreeding or to ensure outcrossing. In the prides, most lionesses are related to one another. If there is more than one dominant male, the group of alpha males are usually related. Two lines are then being &quot;line bred&quot;. Also, in some populations, such as the Crater lions, it is known that a population bottleneck has occurred. Researchers found far greater genetic heterozygosity than expected. In fact, predators are known for low genetic variance, along with most of the top portion of the trophic levels of an ecosystem. Additionally, the alpha males of two neighboring prides can be from the same litter; one brother may come to acquire leadership over another&#x27;s pride, and subsequently mate with his &#x27;nieces&#x27; or cousins. However, killing another male&#x27;s cubs, upon the takeover, allows the new selected gene complement of the incoming alpha male to prevail over the previous male. There are genetic assays being scheduled for lions to determine their genetic diversity. The preliminary studies show results inconsistent with the outcrossing paradigm based on individual environments of the studied groups.

In Central California, sea otters were thought to have been driven to extinction due to over hunting, until a small colony was discovered in the Point Sur region in the 1930s. Since then, the population has grown and spread along the central Californian coast to around 2,000 individuals, a level that has remained stable for over a decade. Population growth is limited by the fact that all Californian sea otters are descended from the isolated colony, resulting in inbreeding.

Cheetahs are another example of inbreeding. Thousands of years ago, the cheetah went through a population bottleneck that reduced its population dramatically so the animals that are alive today are all related to one another. A consequence from inbreeding for this species has been high juvenile mortality, low fecundity, and poor breeding success.

In a study on an island population of song sparrows, individuals that were inbred showed significantly lower survival rates than outbred individuals during a severe winter weather related population crash. These studies show that inbreeding depression and ecological factors have an influence on survival.

The Florida panther population was reduced to about 30 animals, so inbreeding became a problem. Several females were imported from Texas and now the population is better off genetically.

==Measures==
A measure of inbreeding of an individual A is the probability &quot;F&quot;(A) that both alleles in one locus are derived from the same allele in an ancestor. These two identical alleles that are both derived from a common ancestor are said to be identical by descent. This probability F(A) is called the &quot;coefficient of inbreeding&quot;.

Another useful measure that describes the extent to which two individuals are related (say individuals A and B) is their coancestry coefficient f(A,B), which gives the probability that one randomly selected allele from A and another randomly selected allele from B are identical by descent. This is also denoted as the kinship coefficient between A and B.

A particular case is the self-coancestry of individual A with itself, f(A,A), which is the probability that taking one random allele from A and then, independently and with replacement, another random allele also from A, both are identical by descent. Since they can be identical by descent by sampling the same allele or by sampling both alleles that happen to be identical by descent, we have f(A,A) = 1/2 + F(A)/2.

Both the inbreeding and the coancestry coefficients can be defined for specific individuals or as average population values. They can be computed from genealogies or estimated from the population size and its breeding properties, but all methods assume no selection and are limited to neutral alleles.

There are several methods to compute this percentage. The two main ways are the path method and the tabular method.

Typical coancestries between relatives are as follows:
* Father/daughter or mother/son → 25% ()
* Brother/sister → 25% ()
* Grandfather/granddaughter or grandmother/grandson → 12.5% ()
* Half-brother/half-sister, Double cousins → 12.5% ()
* Uncle/niece or aunt/nephew → 12.5% ()
* Great-grandfather/great-granddaughter or great-grandmother/great-grandson → 6.25% ()
* Half-uncle/niece or half-aunt/nephew → 6.25% ()
* First cousins → 6.25% ()

==Animals==

===Wild animals===
* Banded mongoose females regularly mate with their fathers and brothers.
* Bed bugs: North Carolina State University found that bedbugs, in contrast to most other insects, tolerate incest and are able to genetically withstand the effects of inbreeding quite well.
* Common fruit fly females prefer to mate with their own brothers over unrelated males.
* Cottony cushion scales: &#x27;It turns out that females in these hermaphrodite insects are not really fertilizing their eggs themselves, but instead are having this done by a parasitic tissue that infects them at birth,&#x27; says Laura Ross of Oxford University&#x27;s Department of Zoology. &#x27;It seems that this infectious tissue derives from left-over sperm from their father, who has found a sneaky way of having more children by mating with his daughters.&#x27;
* &quot;Adactylidium&quot;: The single male offspring mite mates with all the daughters when they are still in the mother. The females, now impregnated, cut holes in their mother&#x27;s body so that they can emerge. The male emerges as well, but does not look for food or new mates, and dies after a few hours. The females die at the age of 4 days, when their own offspring eat them alive from the inside.
===Domestic animals===


Breeding in domestic animals is primarily assortative breeding (see selective breeding). Without the sorting of individuals by trait, a breed could not be established, nor could poor genetic material be removed.
Homozygosity is the case where similar or identical alleles combine to express a trait that is not otherwise expressed (recessiveness). Inbreeding exposes recessive alleles through increasing homozygosity.

Breeders must avoid breeding from individuals that demonstrate either homozygosity or heterozygosity for disease causing alleles. The goal of preventing the transfer of deleterious alleles may be achieved by reproductive isolation, sterilization, or, in the extreme case, culling. Culling is not strictly necessary if genetics are the only issue in hand. Small animals such as cats and dogs may be sterilized, but in the case of large agricultural animals, such as cattle, culling is usually the only economic option.

The issue of casual breeders who inbreed irresponsibly is discussed in the following quotation on cattle:
Meanwhile, milk production per cow per lactation increased from 17,444 lbs to 25,013 lbs from 1978 to 1998 for the Holstein breed. Mean breeding values for milk of Holstein cows increased by 4,829 lbs during this period. High producing cows are increasingly difficult to breed and are subject to higher health costs than cows of lower genetic merit for production (Cassell, 2001).

Intensive selection for higher yield has increased relationships among animals within breed and increased the rate of casual inbreeding.
Many of the traits that affect profitability in crosses of modern dairy breeds have not been studied in designed experiments. Indeed, all crossbreeding research involving North American breeds and strains is very dated (McAllister, 2001) if it exists at all.

As a result of long-term cooperation between USDA and dairy farmers which led to a revolution in dairy cattle productivity, the United States has since 1992 been the world’s largest supplier of dairy bull semen. However, US genomic technology has resulted in the US dairy cattle population becoming &quot;the most inbred it’s ever been&quot; and the rate of increase in US national milk yield has tapered off. Efforts are now being made to identify desirable genes in cattle breeds not yet optimized by US dairy breeders in order to apply hybrid vigor to the US dairy cattle population and thus propel US dairy technology to even higher levels of productivity.

The BBC produced two documentaries on dog inbreeding titled &quot;Pedigree Dogs Exposed&quot; and &quot;Pedigree Dogs Exposed: Three Years On&quot; that document the negative health consequences of excessive inbreeding.

====Linebreeding====
Linebreeding is a form of inbreeding. There is no clear distinction between the two terms, but linebreeding may encompass crosses between individuals and their descendants or two cousins. This method can be used to increase a particular animal&#x27;s contribution to the population. While linebreeding is less likely to cause problems in the first generation than does inbreeding, over time, linebreeding can reduce the genetic diversity of a population and cause problems related to a too-small gene pool that may include an increased prevalence of genetic disorders and inbreeding depression.

====Outcrossing====
Outcrossing is where two unrelated individuals are crossed to produce progeny. In outcrossing, unless there is verifiable genetic information, one may find that all individuals are distantly related to an ancient progenitor. If the trait carries throughout a population, all individuals can have this trait. This is called the founder effect. In the well established breeds, that are commonly bred, a large gene pool is present. For example, in 2004, over 18,000 Persian cats were registered. A possibility exists for a complete outcross, if no barriers exist between the individuals to breed. However, it is not always the case, and a form of distant linebreeding occurs. Again it is up to the assortative breeder to know what sort of traits, both positive and negative, exist within the diversity of one breeding. This diversity of genetic expression, within even close relatives, increases the variability and diversity of viable stock.

===Laboratory animals===
Systematic inbreeding and maintenance of inbred strains of laboratory mice and rats is of great importance for biomedical research. The inbreeding guarantees a consistent and uniform animal model for experimental purposes and enables genetic studies in congenic and knock-out animals. In order to achieve a mouse strain that is considered inbred, a minimum of 20 sequential generations of sibling matings must occur. With each successive generation of breeding, homozygosity in the entire genome increases, eliminating heterozygous loci. With 20 generations of sibling matings, homozygosity is occurring at roughly 98.7% of all loci in the genome, allowing for these offspring to serve as animal models for genetic studies. The use of inbred strains is also important for genetic studies in animal models, for example to distinguish genetic from environmental effects. The mice that are inbred typically show considerably lower survival rates.

==Humans==

===Effects===
Inbreeding increases homozygosity, which can increase the chances of the expression of deleterious or beneficial recessive alleles and therefore has the potential to either decrease or increase the fitness of the offspring. Depending on the rate of inbreeding, natural selection may still be able to eliminate deleterious alleles. With continuous inbreeding, genetic variation is lost and homozygosity is increased, enabling the expression of recessive deleterious alleles in homozygotes. The coefficient of inbreeding, or the degree of inbreeding in an individual, is an estimate of the percent of homozygous alleles in the overall genome. The more biologically related the parents are, the greater the coefficient of inbreeding, since their genomes have many similarities already. This overall homozygosity becomes an issue when there are deleterious recessive alleles in the gene pool of the family. By pairing chromosomes of similar genomes, the chance for these recessive alleles to pair and become homozygous greatly increases, leading to offspring with autosomal recessive disorders. However, these deleterious effects are common for very close relatives but not for those related on the 3rd cousin or greater level, who exhibit increased fitness.

Inbreeding is especially problematic in small populations where the genetic variation is already limited. By inbreeding, individuals are further decreasing genetic variation by increasing homozygosity in the genomes of their offspring. Thus, the likelihood of deleterious recessive alleles to pair is significantly higher in a small inbreeding population than in a larger inbreeding population.

The fitness consequences of consanguineous mating have been studied since their scientific recognition by Charles Darwin in 1839. Some of the most harmful effects known from such breeding includes its effects on the mortality rate as well as on the general health of the offspring. Since the 1960s, there have been many studies to support such debilitating effects on the human organism. Specifically, inbreeding has been found to decrease fertility as a direct result of increasing homozygosity of deleterious recessive alleles. Fetuses produced by inbreeding also face a greater risk of spontaneous abortions due to inherent complications in development. Among mothers who experience stillbirths and early infant deaths, those that are inbreeding have a significantly higher chance of reaching repeated results with future offspring. Additionally, consanguineous parents possess a high risk of premature birth and producing underweight and undersized infants. Viable inbred offspring are also likely to be inflicted with physical deformities and genetically inherited diseases. Studies have confirmed an increase in several genetic disorders due to inbreeding such as blindness, hearing loss, neonatal diabetes, limb malformations, disorders of sex development, schizophrenia and several others. Moreover, there is an increased risk for congenital heart disease depending on the inbreeding coefficient (See coefficient of inbreeding) of the offspring, with significant risk accompanied by an F =.125 or higher.

=== Prevalence ===
The general negative outlook and eschewal of inbreeding that is prevalent in the Western world today has roots from over 2000 years ago. Specifically, written documents such as the Bible illustrate that there have been laws and social customs that have called for the abstention from inbreeding. Along with cultural taboos, parental education and awareness of inbreeding consequences have played large roles in minimizing inbreeding frequencies in areas like Europe. That being so, there are less urbanized and less populated regions across the world that have shown continuity in the practice of inbreeding.

The continuity of inbreeding is often either by choice or unavoidably due to the limitations of the geographical area. When by choice, the rate of consanguinity is highly dependent on religion and culture. In the Western world, some Anabaptist groups are highly inbred because they originate from small founder populations that have bred as a closed population.

Of the practicing regions, Middle Eastern and northern African nations show the greatest frequencies of consanguinity.

Among these populations with high levels of inbreeding, researchers have found several disorders prevalent among inbred offspring. In Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Israel, the offspring of consanguineous relationships have an increased risk of congenital malformations, congenital heart defects, congenital hydrocephalus and neural tube defects. Furthermore, among inbred children in Palestine and Lebanon, there is a positive association between consanguinity and reported cleft lip/palate cases. Historically, populations of Qatar have engaged in consanguineous relationships of all kinds, leading to high risk of inheriting genetic diseases. As of 2014, around 5% of the Qatari population suffered from hereditary hearing loss; most were descendants of a consanguineous relationship. In 2017-2019, congenital anomalies due to inbreeding was the most common cause of death of babies belonging to the Pakistani and Bangladeshi ethnic groups in England and Wales.

===Royalty and nobility===

Inter-nobility marriage was used as a method of forming political alliances among elites. These ties were often sealed only upon the birth of progeny within the arranged marriage. Thus marriage was seen as a union of lines of nobility and not as a contract between individuals.

Royal intermarriage was often practiced among European royal families, usually for interests of state. Over time, due to the relatively limited number of potential consorts, the gene pool of many ruling families grew progressively smaller, until all European royalty was related. This also resulted in many being descended from a certain person through many lines of descent, such as the numerous European royalty and nobility descended from the British Queen Victoria or King Christian IX of Denmark. The House of Habsburg was known for its intermarriages; the Habsburg lip often cited as an ill-effect. The closely related houses of Habsburg, Bourbon, Braganza and Wittelsbach also frequently engaged in first-cousin unions as well as the occasional double-cousin and uncle–niece marriages.

In ancient Egypt, royal women were believed to carry the bloodlines and so it was advantageous for a pharaoh to marry his sister or half-sister; in such cases a special combination between endogamy and polygamy is found. Normally, the old ruler&#x27;s eldest son and daughter (who could be either siblings or half-siblings) became the new rulers. All rulers of the Ptolemaic dynasty uninterruptedly from Ptolemy IV (Ptolemy II married his sister but had no issue) were married to their brothers and sisters, so as to keep the Ptolemaic blood &quot;pure&quot; and to strengthen the line of succession. King Tutankhamun&#x27;s mother is reported to have been the half-sister to his father, Cleopatra VII (also called Cleopatra VI) and Ptolemy XIII, who married and became co-rulers of ancient Egypt following their father&#x27;s death, are the most widely known example.

<text>An incest taboo is any cultural rule or norm that prohibits sexual relations between certain members of the same family, mainly between individuals related by blood. All known human cultures have norms that exclude certain close relatives from those considered suitable or permissible sexual or marriage partners, making such relationships taboo. However, different norms exist among cultures as to which blood relations are permissible as sexual partners and which are not. Sexual relations between related persons which are subject to the taboo are called incestuous relationships.

Some cultures proscribe sexual relations between clan-members, even when no traceable biological relationship exists, while members of other clans are permissible irrespective of the existence of a biological relationship. In many cultures, certain types of cousin relations are preferred as sexual and marital partners, whereas in others these are taboo. Some cultures permit sexual and marital relations between aunts/uncles and nephews/nieces. In some instances, brother–sister marriages have been practised by the elites with some regularity. Parent–child and sibling–sibling unions are almost universally taboo.

==Origin==
Debate about the origin of the incest taboo has often been framed as a question of whether it is based in nature or nurture.

One explanation sees the incest taboo as a cultural implementation of a biologically evolved preference for sexual partners with whom one is unlikely to share genes, since inbreeding may have detrimental outcomes. The most widely held hypothesis proposes that the so-called Westermarck effect discourages adults from engaging in sexual relations with individuals with whom they grew up. The existence of the Westermarck effect has achieved some empirical support.

Another school argues that the incest prohibition is a cultural construct which arises as a side effect of a general human preference for group exogamy, which arises because intermarriage between groups construct valuable alliances that improve the ability for both groups to thrive. According to this view, the incest taboo is not necessarily universal, but is likely to arise and become more strict under cultural circumstances that favour exogamy over endogamy, and likely to become more lax under circumstances that favor endogamy. This hypothesis has also achieved some empirical support.

===Limits to biological evolution of taboo===
While it is theoretically possible that natural selection may, under certain genetic circumstances, select for individuals that instinctively avoid mating with (close) relatives, incest will still exist in the gene pool because even genetically weakened, inbred individuals are better watchposts against predators than none at all, and weak individuals are useful for the stronger individuals in the group as looking out for predators without being able to seriously compete with the stronger individuals. Additionally, protecting the health of closer relatives and their inbred offspring is more evolutionarily advantageous than punishing said relative, especially in a context where predation and starvation are significant factors, as opposed to a rich welfare state.

==Research==
Modern anthropology developed at a time when a great many human societies were illiterate, and much of the research on incest taboos has taken place in societies without legal codes, and, therefore, without written laws concerning marriage and incest. Nevertheless, anthropologists have found that the institution of marriage, and rules concerning appropriate and inappropriate sexual behavior, exist in every society. The following excerpt from &quot;Notes and Queries on Anthropology&quot; (1951), a well-established field manual for ethnographic research, illustrates the scope of ethnographic investigation into the matter:

These theories anthropologists are generally concerned solely with brother–sister incest, and are not claiming that all sexual relations among family members are taboo or even necessarily considered incestuous by that society. These theories are further complicated by the fact that in many societies people related to one another in different ways, and sometimes distantly, are classified together as siblings, and others who are just as closely related genetically are not considered family members.

The definition restricts itself to sexual intercourse; this does not mean that other forms of sexual contact do not occur, or are proscribed, or prescribed. For example, in some Inuit societies in the Arctic, and traditionally in Bali, mothers would routinely stroke the penises of their infant sons; such behavior was considered no more sexual than breastfeeding.

In these theories, anthropologists are primarily concerned with marriage rules and not actual sexual behavior. In short, anthropologists were not studying &quot;incest&quot; per se; they were asking informants what they meant by &quot;incest&quot;, and what the consequences of &quot;incest&quot; were, in order to map out social relationships within the community.

This excerpt also suggests that the relationship between sexual and marriage practices is complex, and that societies distinguish between different sorts of prohibitions. In other words, although an individual may be prohibited from marrying or having sexual relations with many people, different sexual relations may be prohibited for different reasons, and with different penalties.

For example, Trobriand Islanders prohibit both sexual relations between a woman and her brother, and between a woman and her father, but they describe these prohibitions in very different ways: relations between a woman and her brother fall within the category of forbidden relations among members of the same clan; relations between a woman and her father do not. This is because the Trobrianders are matrilineal; children belong to the clan of their mother and not of their father. Thus, sexual relations between a man and his mother&#x27;s sister (and mother&#x27;s sister&#x27;s daughter) are also considered incestuous, but relations between a man and his father&#x27;s sister are not. A man and his father&#x27;s sister will often have a flirtatious relationship, and, far from being taboo, Trobriand society encourages a man and his father&#x27;s sister or the daughter of his father&#x27;s sister to have sexual relations or marry.

===Instinctual and genetic explanations===

An explanation for the taboo is that it is due to an instinctual, inborn aversion that would lower the adverse genetic effects of inbreeding such as a higher incidence of congenital birth defects (see article Inbreeding depression). Since the rise of modern genetics, belief in this theory has grown.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.1038/ng1094-117&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

====Birth defects and inbreeding====
The increase in frequency of birth defects often attributed to inbreeding results directly from an increase in the frequency of homozygous alleles inherited by the offspring of inbred couples. This leads to an increase in homozygous allele frequency within a population, and results in diverging effects. Should a child inherit the version of homozygous alleles responsible for a birth defect from its parents, the birth defect will be expressed; on the other hand, should the child inherit the version of homozygous alleles not responsible for a birth defect, it would actually decrease the ratio of the allele version responsible for the birth defect in that population. The overall consequences of these diverging effects depends in part on the size of the population.

In small populations, as long as children born with inheritable birth defects die (or are killed) before they reproduce, the ultimate effect of inbreeding will be to &quot;decrease&quot; the frequency of defective genes in the population; over time, the gene pool will be healthier. However, in larger populations, it is more likely that large numbers of carriers will survive and mate, leading to more constant rates of birth defects. Besides recessive genes, there are also other reasons why inbreeding may be harmful, such as a narrow range of certain immune systems genes in a population increasing vulnerability to infectious diseases (see Major histocompatibility complex and sexual selection). The biological costs of incest also depend largely on the degree of genetic proximity between the two relatives engaging in incest. This fact may explain why the cultural taboo generally includes prohibitions against sex between close relatives but less often includes prohibitions against sex between more distal relatives. Children born of close relatives have decreased survival. Many mammal species, including humanity&#x27;s closest primate relatives, avoid incest.

====Westermarck effect====

The Westermarck effect, first proposed by Edvard Westermarck in 1891, is the theory that children reared together, regardless of biological relationship, form a sentimental attachment that is by its nature non-erotic. Melford Spiro argued that his observations that unrelated children reared together on Israeli Kibbutzim nevertheless avoided one another as sexual partners confirmed the Westermarck effect. Joseph Shepher in a study examined the second generation in a kibbutz and found no marriages and no sexual activity between the adolescents in the same peer group. This was not enforced but voluntary. Looking at the second generation adults in all kibbutzim, out of a total of 2769 marriages, none were between those of the same peer group.

However, according to a book review by John Hartung of a book by Shepher, out of 2516 marriages documented in Israel, 200 were between couples reared in the same kibbutz. These marriages occurred after young adults reared on kibbutzim had served in the military and encountered tens of thousands of other potential mates, and 200 marriages is higher than what would be expected by chance. Of these 200 marriages, five were between men and women who had been reared together for the first six years of their lives, which would argue against the Westermarck effect.

A study in Taiwan of marriages where the future bride is adopted in the groom&#x27;s family as an infant or small child found that these marriages have higher infidelity and divorce and lower fertility than ordinary marriages; it has been argued that this observation is consistent with the Westermarck effect.

====Third-parties&#x27; objections====
Another approach is looking at moral objections to third-party incest. This increases the longer a child has grown up together with another child of the opposite sex. This occurs even if the other child is genetically unrelated. Humans have been argued to have a special kin detection system that besides the incest taboo also regulates a tendency towards altruism towards kin.

====Counter arguments====
One objection against an instinctive and genetic basis for the incest taboo is that incest does occur. Anthropologists have also argued that the social construct &quot;incest&quot; (and the incest taboo) is not the same thing as the biological phenomenon of &quot;inbreeding&quot;. For example, there is equal genetic relation between a man and the daughter of his father&#x27;s sister and between a man and the daughter of his mother&#x27;s sister, such that biologists would consider mating incestuous in both instances, but Trobrianders consider mating incestuous in one case and not in the other. Anthropologists have documented a great number of societies where marriages between some first cousins are prohibited as incestuous, while marriages between other first cousins are encouraged. Therefore, it is argued that the prohibition against incestuous relations in most societies is not based on or motivated by concerns over biological closeness. Other studies on cousin marriages have found support for a biological basis for the taboo. Also, current supporters of genetic influences on behavior do not argue that genes determine behavior absolutely, but that genes may create predispositions that are affected in various ways by the environment (including culture).

Steve Stewart-Williams argues against the view that incest taboo is a Western phenomenon, arguing that while brother–sister marriage was reported in a diverse range of cultures such Egyptian, Incan, and Hawaiian cultures, it was not a culture-wide phenomenon, being largely restricted to the upper classes. Stewart-Williams argues that these marriages were largely political (their function being to keep power and wealth concentrated in the family) and there is no evidence the siblings were attracted to each other and there is in fact some evidence against it (for example, Cleopatra married two of her brothers but did not have children with them, only having children with unrelated lovers). Stewart-Williams suggests that this was therefore simply a case of social pressure overriding anti-incest instincts. Stewart-Williams also observes that anti-incest behaviour has been observed in other animals and even many plant species (many plants could self-pollinate but have mechanisms that prevent them from doing so).

===Sociological explanations===
Psychoanalytic theory—in particular, the claimed existence of an Oedipus complex, which is not an instinctual aversion against incest but an instinctual desire—has influenced many theorists seeking to explain the incest taboo using sociological theories.

====Exogamy====
The anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss developed a general argument for the universality of the incest taboo in human societies. His argument begins with the claim that the incest taboo is in effect a prohibition against endogamy, and the effect is to encourage exogamy. Through exogamy, otherwise unrelated households or lineages will form relationships through marriage, thus strengthening social solidarity. That is, Lévi-Strauss views marriage as an exchange of women between two social groups. This theory is based in part on Marcel Mauss&#x27;s theory of &quot;The Gift&quot;, which (in Lévi-Strauss&#x27; words) argued:

It is also based on Lévi-Strauss&#x27;s analysis of data on different kinship systems and marriage practices documented by anthropologists and historians. Lévi-Strauss called attention specifically to data collected by Margaret Mead during her research among the Arapesh. When she asked if a man ever sleeps with his sister, Arapesh replied: &quot;No we don&#x27;t sleep with our sisters; we give our sisters to other men, and other men give us their sisters.&quot; Mead pressed the question repeatedly, asking what would happen if a brother and sister did have sex with one another. Lévi-Strauss quotes the Arapesh response:

By applying Mauss&#x27;s theory to data such as Mead&#x27;s, Lévi-Strauss proposed what he called alliance theory. He argued that, in &quot;primitive&quot; societies—societies not based on agriculture, class hierarchies, or centralized government—marriage is not fundamentally a relationship between a man and a woman, but a transaction involving a woman that forges a relationship—an alliance—between two men. 

Some anthropologists argue that nuclear family incest avoidance can be explained in terms of the ecological, demographic, and economic benefits of exogamy.

While Lévi-Strauss generally discounted the relevance of alliance theory in Africa, a particularly strong concern for incest is a fundamental issue among the age systems of East Africa. Here, the avoidance between men of an age-set and their daughters is altogether more intense than in any other sexual avoidance. Paraphrasing Lévi-Strauss&#x27;s argument, without this avoidance, the rivalries for power between age-sets, coupled with the close bonds of sharing between age-mates, could lead to a sharing of daughters as spouses. Young men entering the age system would then find a dire shortage of marriageable girls, and extended families would be in danger of dying out. Thus, by parading this avoidance of their daughters, senior men make these girls available for younger age-sets and their marriages form alliances that mitigate the rivalries for power.

====Endogamy====
Exogamy between households or descent groups is typically prescribed in classless societies. Societies that are stratified—that is, divided into unequal classes—often prescribe different degrees of endogamy. Endogamy is the opposite of exogamy; it refers to the practice of marriage between members of the same social group. An example is India&#x27;s caste system, in which unequal castes are endogamous. Inequality between ethnic groups and races also correlates with endogamy.

An extreme example of this principle, and an exception to the incest taboo, is found among members of the ruling class in certain ancient states, such as the Inca, Egypt, China, and Hawaii; brother–sister marriage (usually between half-siblings) was a means of maintaining wealth and political power within one family. Some scholars have argued that in Roman-governed Egypt this practice was also found among commoners, but others have argued that this was in fact not the norm.

<doc id="54749" wikidata="Q1087688" url="?curid=54749" title="Chromatic aberration">
<text>In optics, chromatic aberration (CA), also called chromatic distortion, color aberration, color fringing, or purple fringing, is a failure of a lens to focus all colors to the same point. It is caused by dispersion: the refractive index of the lens elements varies with the wavelength of light. The refractive index of most transparent materials decreases with increasing wavelength. Since the focal length of a lens depends on the refractive index, this variation in refractive index affects focusing. Since the focal length of the lens varies with the color of the light different colors of light are brought to focus at different distances from the lens or with different levels of magnification. Chromatic aberration manifests itself as &quot;fringes&quot; of color along boundaries that separate dark and bright parts of the image.

==Types==

There are two types of chromatic aberration: &quot;axial&quot; (&quot;longitudinal&quot;), and &quot;transverse&quot; (&quot;lateral&quot;). Axial aberration occurs when different wavelengths of light are focused at different distances from the lens (focus &quot;shift&quot;). Longitudinal aberration is typical at long focal lengths. Transverse aberration occurs when different wavelengths are focused at different positions in the focal plane, because the magnification and/or distortion of the lens also varies with wavelength. Transverse aberration is typical at short focal lengths. The ambiguous acronym LCA is sometimes used for either &quot;longitudinal&quot; or &quot;lateral&quot; chromatic aberration.

The two types of chromatic aberration have different characteristics, and may occur together. Axial CA occurs throughout the image and is specified by optical engineers, optometrists, and vision scientists in diopters. It can be reduced by stopping down, which increases depth of field so that though the different wavelengths focus at different distances, they are still in acceptable focus. Transverse CA does not occur on the optical axis of an optical system (which is typically the center of the image) and increases away from the optical axis. It is not affected by stopping down since it is caused by the different magnification of the lens with each color of light.

In digital sensors, axial CA results in the red and blue planes being defocused (assuming that the green plane is in focus), which is relatively difficult to remedy in post-processing, while transverse CA results in the red, green, and blue planes being at different magnifications (magnification changing along radii, as in geometric distortion), and can be corrected by radially scaling the planes appropriately so they line up.

==Minimization==
In the earliest uses of lenses, chromatic aberration was reduced by increasing the focal length of the lens where possible. For example, this could result in extremely long telescopes such as the very long aerial telescopes of the 17th century. Isaac Newton&#x27;s theories about white light being composed of a spectrum of colors led him to the conclusion that uneven refraction of light caused chromatic aberration (leading him to build the first reflecting telescope, his Newtonian telescope, in 1668.)

Modern telescopes, as well as other catoptric and catadioptric systems, continue to use mirrors, which have no chromatic aberration.

There exists a point called the &quot;circle of least confusion&quot;, where chromatic aberration can be minimized. It can be further minimized by using an achromatic lens or &quot;achromat&quot;, in which materials with differing dispersion are assembled together to form a compound lens. The most common type is an achromatic doublet, with elements made of crown and flint glass. This perfectly corrects the aberration at two wavelengths and reduces the amount of chromatic aberration over a range of nearby wavelengths. By combining more than two lenses of different composition, the degree of correction can be further increased, as seen in an apochromatic lens or &quot;apochromat&quot;, which provides perfect correction at three wavelengths. In general, correcting at three wavelengths will make the error on other wavelengths quite small, but an achromat made with low dispersion glass may still provide better correction than an apochromat made with more conventional glass.

Many types of glass have been developed to reduce chromatic aberration. These are low dispersion glass, most notably, glasses containing fluorite. These hybridized glasses have a very low level of optical dispersion; only two compiled lenses made of these substances can yield a high level of correction.

The use of achromats was an important step in the development of optical microscopes and telescopes.

An alternative to achromatic doublets is the use of diffractive optical elements. Diffractive optical elements are able to generate arbitrary complex wave fronts from a sample of optical material which is essentially flat. Diffractive optical elements have negative dispersion characteristics, complementary to the positive Abbe numbers of optical glasses and plastics. Specifically, in the visible part of the spectrum diffractives have a negative Abbe number of −3.5. Diffractive optical elements can be fabricated using diamond turning techniques.

Telephoto lenses using diffractive elements to minimize chromatic aberration are commercially available from Canon and Nikon for interchangeable-lens cameras; these include 800mm f/6.3, 500mm f/5.6, and 300mm f/4 models by Nikon (branded as &quot;phase fresnel&quot; or PF), and 800mm f/11, 600mm f/11, and 400mm f/4 models by Canon (branded as &quot;diffractive optics&quot; or DO). They produce sharp images with reduced chromatic aberration at a lower weight and size than traditional optics of similar specifications and are generally well-regarded by wildlife photographers.


===Mathematics of chromatic aberration minimization===

For a doublet consisting of two thin lenses in contact, the Abbe number of the lens materials is used to calculate the correct focal length of the lenses to ensure correction of chromatic aberration. If the focal lengths of the two lenses for light at the yellow Fraunhofer D-line (589.2 nm) are &quot;f&quot;1 and &quot;f&quot;2, then best correction occurs for the condition:
:formula_1
where &quot;V&quot;1 and &quot;V&quot;2 are the Abbe numbers of the materials of the first and second lenses, respectively. Since Abbe numbers are positive, one of the focal lengths must be negative, i.e., a diverging lens, for the condition to be met.

The overall focal length of the doublet &quot;f&quot; is given by the standard formula for thin lenses in contact:
:formula_2
and the above condition ensures this will be the focal length of the doublet for light at the blue and red Fraunhofer F and C lines (486.1 nm and 656.3 nm respectively). The focal length for light at other visible wavelengths will be similar but not exactly equal to this.

Chromatic aberration is used during a duochrome eye test to ensure that a correct lens power has been selected. The patient is confronted with red and green images and asked which is sharper. If the prescription is right, then the cornea, lens and prescribed lens will focus the red and green wavelengths just in front, and behind the retina, appearing of equal sharpness. If the lens is too powerful or weak, then one will focus on the retina, and the other will be much more blurred in comparison.

==Image processing to reduce the appearance of lateral chromatic aberration==

In some circumstances, it is possible to correct some of the effects of chromatic aberration in digital post-processing. However, in real-world circumstances, chromatic aberration results in permanent loss of some image detail. Detailed knowledge of the optical system used to produce the image can allow for some useful correction. In an ideal situation, post-processing to remove or correct lateral chromatic aberration would involve scaling the fringed color channels, or subtracting some of a scaled versions of the fringed channels, so that all channels spatially overlap each other correctly in the final image.

As chromatic aberration is complex (due to its relationship to focal length, etc.) some camera manufacturers employ lens-specific chromatic aberration appearance minimization techniques. Almost every major camera manufacturer enables some form of chromatic aberration correction, both in-camera and via their proprietary software. Third-party software tools such as PTLens are also capable of performing complex chromatic aberration appearance minimization with their large database of cameras and lens.

In reality, even theoretically perfect post-processing based chromatic aberration reduction-removal-correction systems do not increase image detail as well as a lens that is optically well-corrected for chromatic aberration would for the following reasons:
* Rescaling is only applicable to lateral chromatic aberration but there is also longitudinal chromatic aberration
* Rescaling individual color channels result in a loss of resolution from the original image
* Most camera sensors only capture a few and discrete (e.g., RGB) color channels but chromatic aberration is not discrete and occurs across the light spectrum
* The dyes used in the digital camera sensors for capturing color are not very efficient so cross-channel color contamination is unavoidable and causes, for example, the chromatic aberration in the red channel to also be blended into the green channel along with any green chromatic aberration.

The above are closely related to the specific scene that is captured so no amount of programming and knowledge of the capturing equipment (e.g., camera and lens data) can overcome these limitations.

==Photography==
The term &quot;purple fringing&quot; is commonly used in photography, although not all purple fringing can be attributed to chromatic aberration.
Similar colored fringing around highlights may also be caused by lens flare. Colored fringing around highlights or dark regions may be due to the receptors for different colors having differing dynamic range or sensitivity – therefore preserving detail in one or two color channels, while &quot;blowing out&quot; or failing to register, in the other channel or channels. On digital cameras, the particular demosaicing algorithm is likely to affect the apparent degree of this problem. Another cause of this fringing is chromatic aberration in the very small microlenses used to collect more light for each CCD pixel; since these lenses are tuned to correctly focus green light, the incorrect focusing of red and blue results in purple fringing around highlights. This is a uniform problem across the frame, and is more of a problem in CCDs with a very small pixel pitch such as those used in compact cameras. Some cameras, such as the Panasonic Lumix series and newer Nikon and Sony DSLRs, feature a processing step specifically designed to remove it.

On photographs taken using a digital camera, very small highlights may frequently appear to have chromatic aberration where in fact the effect is because the highlight image is too small to stimulate all three color pixels, and so is recorded with an incorrect color. This may not occur with all types of digital camera sensor. Again, the de-mosaicing algorithm may affect the apparent degree of the problem.

===Black-and-white photography===

Chromatic aberration also affects black-and-white photography. Although there are no colors in the photograph, chromatic aberration will blur the image. It can be reduced by using a narrow-band color filter, or by converting a single color channel to black and white. This will, however, require longer exposure (and change the resulting image). (This is only true with panchromatic black-and-white film, since orthochromatic film is already sensitive to only a limited spectrum.)

==Electron microscopy==
Chromatic aberration also affects electron microscopy, although instead of different colors having different focal points, different electron energies may have different focal points.

<doc id="54751" wikidata="Q326343" url="?curid=54751" title="Central Tibetan Administration">
<text>The Central Tibetan Administration (, , ) is the Tibetan government in exile, based in Dharamshala, India. It is composed of a judiciary branch, a legislative branch, and an executive branch, and offers support and services to the Tibetan exile community.

The 14th Dalai Lama formally rescinded the 1951 17 Point Agreement with China in early March 1959, as he was escaping Tibet for India. On 29 April 1959, the 14th Dalai Lama in exile re-established the Kashag, which was abolished a month earlier by the Government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China on 28 March 1959. He later became permanent head of the Tibetan Administration and the executive functions for Tibetans-in-exile. On 11 February 1991, Tibet became a founding member of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization (UNPO) at a ceremony held at the Peace Palace in The Hague, Netherlands. After the 14th Dalai Lama decided no longer to assume administrative authority, the Charter of Tibetans in Exile was updated in May 2011 to repeal all articles relating to his political duties.

The Tibetan diaspora and refugees support the Central Tibetan Administration by voting for members of its parliament, the Sikyong, and by making annual financial contributions through the use of the Green Book. The Central Tibetan Administration also receives international support from other organizations and individuals. The Central Tibetan Administration authors reports, press releases, and administers a network of schools and other cultural activities for Tibetans in India.

== Position on Status of Tibet ==

In 1963, the 14th Dalai Lama promulgated the Constitution of Tibet, and he became permanent head of state of Tibet. In 1974, the 14th Dalai Lama rejected calls for Tibetan independence, and he became permanent head of the Tibetan Administration and the executive functions for Tibetans-in-exile in 1991. In 2005, the 14th Dalai Lama emphasized that Tibet is a part of China, and Tibetan culture and Buddhism are part of Chinese culture. In March 2011, at 71 years of age, he decided not to assume any political and administrative authority, the Charter of Tibetans in Exile was updated immediately in May 2011, and all articles related to regents were also repealed. In 2017, the 14th Dalai Lama restated that Tibet does not seek independence from China but seeks development.

== Funding ==
The funding of the Central Tibetan Administration comes mostly from private donations collected with the help of organisations like the Tibet Fund, revenue from the Green Book (the &quot;Tibetan in exile passport&quot;) and aid from governments like India and the US.

The annual revenue of the Central Tibetan Administration is officially 22 million (measured in US dollars), with the biggest shares going to political activity ($7 million), and administration ($4.5 million). However, according to Michael Backman, these sums are &quot;remarkably low&quot; for what the organisation claims to do, and it probably receives millions more in donations. The CTA does not acknowledge such donations or their sources.

According to a Chinese source, between 1964 and 1968, the U.S. provided 1.735 million dollars to the Dalai Lama&#x27;s group each year. In October 1998, The Dalai Lama&#x27;s administration stated that it had received US$1.7 million a year during the 1960s from the Central Intelligence Agency.

In 2002, the Tibetan Policy Act of 2002 was passed in the U.S. In 2016, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) awarded a grant of US$23 million to CTA.

In 2017, U.S. president Donald Trump proposed to stop aid to the CTA in 2018. Trump&#x27;s proposal was criticised heavily by members of the Democratic Party like Nancy Pelosi, and co-chair of the bipartisan Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission, Jim McGovern. In February 2020, at the annual National Prayer Breakfast, Pelosi prayed as Trump attended; &quot;Let us pray for the Panchen Lama and all the Tibetan Buddhists in prison in China or missing for following their faith&quot;.

== Headquarters ==
The Central Tibetan Administration is headquartered in McLeod Ganj, Dharamshala, India. It represents the people of the entire Tibet Autonomous Region and Qinghai province, as well as two Tibetan Autonomous Prefectures and one Tibetan Autonomous County in Sichuan Province, one Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture and one Tibetan Autonomous County in Gansu Province and one Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province – all of which is termed &quot;Historic Tibet&quot; by the CTA.

The CTA attends to the welfare of the Tibetan exile community in India, who number around 100,000. It runs schools, health services, cultural activities and economic development projects for the Tibetan community. As of 2003, more than 1,000 refugees still arrive each year from China, usually via Nepal.

=== Green Book ===
Tibetans living outside Tibet can apply at a Central Tibetan Administration office in their country of residence for a personal document called the &quot;Green Book&quot;, which serves as a receipt book for the person&#x27;s &quot;voluntary contributions&quot; to the CTA and the evidence of their claims for &quot;Tibetan citizenship&quot;.

For this purpose, CTA defines a Tibetan as &quot;any person born in Tibet, or any person with one parent who was born in Tibet.&quot; As Tibetan refugees often lack documents attesting to their place of birth, the eligibility is usually established by an interview.

=== Blue Book ===
The Blue Book or Tibetan Solidarity Partnership is a project by Central Tibetan Administration, in which the CTA issues any supporter of Tibet who is of age 18 years or more a Blue Book. This initiative enables supporters of Tibet worldwide to make financial contributions to help the administration in supporting educational, cultural, developmental and humanitarian activities related to Tibetan children and refugees. The book is issued at various CTA offices worldwide.

== Internal structure ==


The Central Tibetan Administration currently operates under the &quot;Charter of the Tibetans In-Exile&quot;, adopted in 1991, amended in 2011. Executive authority is vested in the Sikyong, an office formerly held by Lobsang Sangay, who was elected in 2011. The Sikyong is supported by a cabinet of Kalons responsible for specific portfolios. Legislative authority is vested in the Parliament of the Central Tibetan Administration.

The Central Tibetan Administration&#x27;s Department of Finance is made of seven departments and several special offices. Until 2003, it operated 24 businesses, including publishing, hotels, and handicrafts distribution companies.

On 29 April 1959, the Dalai Lama re-established the Kashag. In 1963, he promulgated Constitution of Tibet, and he became permanent head of state of Tibet. In 1974, he rejected calls for Tibetan independence, and he became permanent head of the Tibetan Administration and the executive functions for Tibetans-in-exile in 1991. On 10 March 2011, at 71 years of age, he decided not to assume any political and administrative authority, the Charter of Tibetans in Exile was updated immediately in May 2011, and all articles related to regents were also repealed, and position Sikyong was created.

=== Kashag ===
Notable past members of the Cabinet include Gyalo Thondup, the Dalai Lama&#x27;s eldest brother, who served as Chairman of the Cabinet and as Kalon of Security, and Jetsun Pema, the Dalai Lama&#x27;s younger sister, who served variously as Kalon of Health and of Education. Lobsang Nyandak Zayul who served as a representative of the 14th Dalai Lama in the Americas and a multiple cabinet member. He currently serves as president of The Tibet Fund.

==Settlements==

The Central Tibetan Administration, together with the Indian government, has constructed more than 45 &quot;settlements&quot; in India for Tibetan refugees as of 2020. The establishment of the Tibetan Re-settlement and Rehabilitation (TRR) settlements began in 1966, with the TRR settlements in South India, Darjeeling, and Sikkim becoming officially &quot;protected areas&quot; and requiring special entry permits for entry.

==Media activities==
A 1978 study by Melvyn Goldstein and a 1983 study by Lynn Pulman on Tibetan communities-in-exile in southern India argue that the CTA adopted a stance of preserving an &quot;idea of return&quot; and fostering the development of an intense feeling of Tibetan cultural and political nationalism among Tibetans&quot; in order to remain a necessary part of the communities. They state that this was accomplished through the creation of the Tibetan Uprising Day holiday, a Tibetan National Anthem, and the CTA control over local Tibetan-language media that promotes the idea of Chinese endeavours to &quot;eradicate the Tibetan race&quot;. From the 1990s onwards, the CTA used Hollywood films in addition to local media to emphasise the Tibetan exile struggle, secure the loyalty of Tibetans both in exile and in Tibet, promote Tibetan nationalism, and foster the CTA&#x27;s legitimacy to act in the name of the entire Tibetan nation.

== Foreign relations ==
The Central Tibetan Authority is not recognised as a sovereign government by any country, but it receives financial aid from governments and international organisations for its welfare work among the Tibetan exile community in India.

===United States===
In 1991, United States President George H. W. Bush signed a Congressional Act that explicitly called Tibet &quot;an occupied country&quot;, and identified the Dalai Lama and his administration as &quot;Tibet&#x27;s true representatives&quot;.

In October 1998 the Dalai Lama&#x27;s administration issued a statement acknowledging the Dalai Lama Group received US$1.7 million a year during the 1960s from the U.S. government through the Central Intelligence Agency, used to train volunteers, run guerrilla operations against the Chinese, and used to open offices and for international lobbying. A guerrilla force was reportedly trained at Camp Hale in Colorado.

During his administration, United States President Barack Obama supported Middle Way Policy of the Central Tibetan Administration and met with the Dalai Lama four times, including at the 2015 annual National Prayer Breakfast.

In 2021, the Biden Administration pledged its support for the CTA, to which a representative expressed gratitude.

<doc id="54752" wikidata="Q804970" url="?curid=54752" title="Liu">
<text>Liu (; or ) is an East Asian surname. pinyin: in Mandarin Chinese, in Cantonese. It is the family name of the Han dynasty emperors. The character originally meant &#x27;battle axe&#x27;, but is now used only as a surname. It is listed 252nd in the classic text Hundred Family Surnames. Today, it is the 4th most common surname in mainland China as well as one of the most common surnames in the world.

==Distribution==
In 2019 劉 was the fourth most common surname in mainland China. Additionally, it was the most common surname in Jiangxi province. In 2013 it was found to be the 5th most common surname, shared by 67,700,000 people or 5.1% of the population, with the province with the most people being Shandong.

==Origin==
One source is that they descend from the Qí (祁) clan of Emperor Yao. For example, the founding emperor of the Han dynasty (one of China&#x27;s golden ages), Liu Bang (Emperor Gaozu of Han) was a descendant of Emperor Yao.

Another origin is from the Jī (姬) clan of King Qing of Zhou. For example, , the youngest son of King Qing of Zhou, founded the and his descendants took state names as surname.

== History ==
Liu was a place name in ancient China (located in present-day Henan). The Liu family name has two main origins from this place name.

Kong Jia, the fourteenth king of the Xia dynasty, was given a male and a female dragon as a reward for his obedience to the god of heaven; yet he could not train them, so he hired a dragon-trainer named Liu Lei (劉累), who had learned how to train dragons from Huanlong. Liu Lei was a descendant of Emperor Yao, and won the admiration of King Kong Jia for his skill at dragon-rearing. To reward Liu Lei, King Kong Jia granted him a place called Liu as his fiefdom. Liu Lei took the name of his fief as his family name. One day, the female dragon died unexpectedly, so Liu Lei secretly chopped her up, cooked her meat, and served it to the king, who loved it so much that he demanded Liu Lei to serve him the same meal again. Since Liu Lei had no means of procuring more dragon meat, he fled the palace. Liu Lei was the first person surnamed Liu in Chinese history, and his descendant Liu Bang founded the Han dynasty.

During the Zhou dynasty, King Ding of Zhou granted the fiefdom of Liu to his younger brother, Ji Jizi (姬季子). Ji Jizi also took Liu as his family name. Eventually, Liu became a state, and Ji Jizi ruled the State of Liu as Duke Kang of Liu. After more than a hundred years under the rule of the Liu family, the State of Liu was destroyed by the central government of the Zhou dynasty.

Liu was the ruling family of the Han dynasty, one of the most prosperous and influential empires in Chinese history. The Han dynasty was founded by Liu Bang. Later, Emperor Liu Che helped expand the Han dynasty even further, ushering in a golden age for China.

The Han dynasty had 30 emperors all surnamed Liu; it was one of the Chinese dynasties with the most emperors. The Han dynasty lasted 400 years, making it one of the longest-lasting Chinese empires in history. The Han is what gives its name to the Han people as well as Han characters / Hanzi / Chinese characters.

Even after the Han dynasty, several Liu continued to hold power within China, including Liu Bei of Shu Han (whose exploits were described in the Records of the Three Kingdoms), as well as the Han-Zhao, Liu Song, Later Han, Northern Han and Southern Han dynasties.

Over history, several non-Han Chinese people have adopted the Liu surname, including Xiongnu and Turkic peoples.

<text>The Tibet Autonomous Region, officially the Xizang Autonomous Region, often shortened to Tibet or Xizang, is an autonomous region of China and part of Southwestern China.

It was formally established in 1965 to replace the Tibet Area, the former administrative division of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) established after its annexation of Tibet in 1951. The establishment was about five years after the 1959 Tibetan uprising and the dismissal of the Kashag, and about 13 years after the original annexation.

The current borders of the Tibet Autonomous Region were generally established in the 18th century and include about half of historical Tibet. The Tibet Autonomous Region spans over , and is the second-largest province-level division of China by area, after Xinjiang. Due to its harsh and rugged terrain, it is sparsely populated at just over 3.6 million people with a population density of , and is the least-populous province in China.

== History ==

Yarlung kings founded the Tibetan Empire in 618. By the end of the 8th century, the empire reached its greatest extent. After a civil war, the empire broke up in 842. The royal lineage fragmented and ruled over small kingdoms such as Guge and Maryul. The Mongols conquered Tibet in 1244 and later ruled it under the Yuan Dynasty but granted the region a degree of political autonomy. The Sakya lama Drogön Chögyal Phagpa became a religious teacher to Kublai Khan in the 1250s and was made the head of the Tibetan region administration .

From 1354 to 1642, Central Tibet (Ü-Tsang) was ruled by a succession of dynasties from Nêdong, Shigatse and Lhasa. In 1642, the Ganden Phodrang court of the 5th Dalai Lama was established by Güshi Khan of the Khoshut Khanate, who was enthroned as King of Tibet. The Khoshuts ruled until 1717, when they were overthrown by the Dzungar Khanate. Despite politically charged historical debate concerning the nature of Sino-Tibetan relations, some historians posit that Tibet under the Ganden Phodrang (1642–1951) was an independent state, albeit under various foreign suzerainties for much of this period, including by the Ming dynasty (1368–1644). The Dzungar forces were in turn expelled by the 1720 expedition to Tibet during the Dzungar–Qing Wars. This began a period of direct Qing rule over Tibet.

From the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1912 until 1950, the State of Tibet was &quot;de facto&quot; independent, as were other regions claimed by the successor Republic of China. The Republican regime, preoccupied with warlordism (1916–1928), civil war (1927–1949) and Japanese invasion (1937–1945), did not exert authority in Tibet. Other regions of ethno-cultural Tibet in eastern Kham and Amdo had been under &quot;de jure&quot; administration of the Chinese dynastic government since the mid-18th century; they form parts of the provinces of Qinghai, Gansu, Sichuan and Yunnan.

In 1950, following the proclamation of the People&#x27;s Republic of China the year before, the People&#x27;s Liberation Army entered Tibet and defeated the Tibetan army in a battle fought near the city of Chamdo. In 1951, Tibetan representatives signed the Seventeen Point Agreement for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet with the Central People&#x27;s Government affirming China&#x27;s sovereignty over Tibet and the annexation of Tibet by the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The 14th Dalai Lama ratified the agreement in October 1951. After the failure of a violent uprising in 1959, the 14th Dalai Lama fled to India and renounced the Seventeen Point Agreement. During the 1950s and 1960s, Western-dispatched insurgents were parachuted into Tibet, almost all of whom were captured and killed. The establishment of the Tibet Autonomous Region in 1965 made Tibet a provincial-level division of China.

== Geography ==

The Tibet Autonomous Region is located on the Tibetan Plateau, the highest region on Earth. In northern Tibet elevations reach an average of over . Mount Everest is located on Tibet&#x27;s border with Nepal.

China&#x27;s provincial-level areas of Xinjiang, Qinghai and Sichuan lie to the north, northeast and east, respectively, of the Tibet AR. There is also a short border with Yunnan Province to the southeast. The countries to the south and southwest are Myanmar, India, Bhutan, and Nepal. China claims Arunachal Pradesh administered by India as part of the Tibet Autonomous Region. It also claims some areas adjoining the Chumbi Valley that are recognised as Bhutan&#x27;s territory, and some areas of eastern Ladakh claimed by India. India and China agreed to respect the Line of Actual Control in a bilateral agreement signed on 7 September 1993.

Physically, the Tibet AR may be divided into two parts: the lakes region in the west and north-west and the river region, which spreads out on three sides of the former on the east, south and west. Both regions receive limited amounts of rainfall as they lie in the rain shadow of the Himalayas; however, the region names are useful in contrasting their hydrological structures, and also in contrasting their different cultural uses: nomadic in the lake region and agricultural in the river region. On the south the Tibet AR is bounded by the Himalayas, and on the north by a broad mountain system. The system at no point narrows to a single range; generally there are three or four across its breadth. As a whole the system forms the watershed between rivers flowing to the Indian Ocean — the Indus, Brahmaputra and Salween and its tributaries — and the streams flowing into the undrained salt lakes to the north.

The lake region extends from the Pangong Tso Lake in Ladakh, Lake Rakshastal, Yamdrok Lake and Lake Manasarovar near the source of the Indus River, to the sources of the Salween, the Mekong and the Yangtze. Other lakes include Dagze Co, Namtso, and Pagsum Co. The lake region is a wind-swept Alpine grassland. This region is called the Chang Tang (Byang sang) or &#x27;Northern Plateau&#x27; by the people of Tibet. It is broad and covers an area about equal to that of France. Due to its great distance from the ocean it is extremely arid and possesses no river outlet. The mountain ranges are spread out, rounded, disconnected, and separated by relatively flat valleys.

The Tibet AR is dotted over with large and small lakes, generally salt or alkaline, and intersected by streams. Due to the presence of discontinuous permafrost over the Chang Tang, the soil is boggy and covered with tussocks of grass, thus resembling the Siberian tundra. Salt and fresh-water lakes are intermingled. The lakes are generally without outlet, or have only a small effluent. The deposits consist of soda, potash, borax and common salt. The lake region is noted for a vast number of hot springs, which are widely distributed between the Himalaya and 34° N, but are most numerous to the west of Tengri Nor (north-west of Lhasa). So intense is the cold in this part of Tibet that these springs are sometimes represented by columns of ice, the nearly boiling water having frozen in the act of ejection.

The river region is characterized by fertile mountain valleys and includes the Yarlung Tsangpo River (the upper courses of the Brahmaputra) and its major tributary, the Nyang River, the Salween, the Yangtze, the Mekong, and the Yellow River. The Yarlung Tsangpo Canyon, formed by a horseshoe bend in the river where it flows around Namcha Barwa, is the deepest and possibly longest canyon in the world. Among the mountains there are many narrow valleys. The valleys of Lhasa, Xigazê, Gyantse and the Brahmaputra are free from permafrost, covered with good soil and groves of trees, well irrigated, and richly cultivated.

The South Tibet Valley is formed by the Yarlung Tsangpo River during its middle reaches, where it travels from west to east. The valley is approximately long and wide. The valley descends from above sea level to . The mountains on either side of the valley are usually around high. Lakes here include Lake Paiku and Lake Puma Yumco.

== Politics ==
The Tibet Autonomous Region is a province-level entity of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Chinese law nominally guarantees some autonomy in the areas of education and language policy. Like other subdivisions of China, routine administration is carried out by a People&#x27;s Government, headed by a chairman, who has been an ethnic Tibetan except for an interregnum during the Cultural Revolution. As with other Chinese provinces, the chairman carries out work under the direction of the regional secretary of the Chinese Communist Party. The standing committee of the regional Communist Party Committee serves as the top rung of political power in the region. The current chairman is Garma Cedain and the current party secretary is Wang Junzheng.

=== Administrative divisions ===
The Autonomous Region is divided into seven prefecture-level divisions: six prefecture-level cities and one prefecture.

These in turn are subdivided into a total of 66 counties and 8 districts (Chengguan, Doilungdêqên, Dagzê, Samzhubzê, Karub, Bayi, Nêdong, and Seni).


====Urban areas====

== Demographics ==

With an average of about two people per square kilometer, Tibet has the lowest population density among any of the Chinese province-level administrative regions, mostly due to its harsh and rugged terrain. In 2023, only 38.9 percent of Tibet&#x27;s population was urban, with 61.1 being rural, amongst the lowest in China, though this is significantly up from 22.6 percent in 2011.

In 2020 the Tibetan population was three million. The ethnic Tibetans, comprising 86.0% of the population, mainly adhere to Tibetan Buddhism and Bön, although there is an ethnic Tibetan Muslim community. Other Muslim ethnic groups such as the Hui and the Salar have inhabited the region. There is also a tiny Tibetan Christian community in eastern Tibet. Smaller tribal groups such as the Monpa and Lhoba, who follow a combination of Tibetan Buddhism and spirit worship, are found mainly in the southeastern parts of the region.

Historically, the population of Tibet consisted of primarily ethnic Tibetans. According to tradition the original ancestors of the Tibetan people, as represented by the six red bands in the Tibetan flag, are: the Se, Mu, Dong, Tong, Dru and Ra. Other traditional ethnic groups with significant population or with the majority of the ethnic group reside in Tibet include Bai people, Blang, Bonan, Dongxiang, Han, Hui people, Lhoba, Lisu people, Miao, Mongols, Monguor (Tu people), Menba (Monpa), Mosuo, Nakhi, Qiang, Nu people, Pumi, Salar, and Yi people.

According to the Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition published between 1910 and 1911, the total population of the Tibetan capital of Lhasa, including the lamas in the city and vicinity, was about 30,000, and the permanent population also included Chinese families (about 2,000).

Most Han people in the Tibet Autonomous Region (12.2% of the total population) are recent migrants, because all of the Han were expelled from &quot;Outer Tibet&quot; (Central Tibet) following the British invasion until the establishment of the PRC. Only 8% of Han people have household registration in TAR, others keep their household registration in place of origin.

Tibetan scholars and exiles claim that, with the 2006 completion of the Qingzang Railway connecting the Tibet Autonomous Region to Qinghai Province, there has been an &quot;acceleration&quot; of Han migration into the region. The Tibetan government-in-exile based in northern India asserts that the PRC is promoting the migration of Han workers and soldiers to Tibet to marginalize and assimilate the locals.

=== Religion ===

The main religion in Tibet has been Buddhism since its introduction in the 8th century AD. Before the arrival of Buddhism, the main religion among Tibetans was an indigenous shamanic and animistic religion, Bon, which now comprises a sizeable minority and influenced the formation of Tibetan Buddhism.

According to estimates from the International Religious Freedom Report of 2012, most Tibetans (who comprise 91% of the population of the Tibet Autonomous Region) are adherents of Tibetan Buddhism, while a minority of 400,000 people are followers the native Bon or folk religions which share the image of Confucius (Tibetan: &quot;Kongtse Trulgyi Gyalpo&quot;) with Chinese folk religion, though in a different light. According to some reports, the government of China has been promoting the Bon religion, linking it with Confucianism.

Most of the Han Chinese who reside in Tibet practice their native Chinese folk religion (). There is a Guandi Temple of Lhasa () where the Chinese god of war Guandi is identified with the cross-ethnic Chinese, Tibetan, Mongol and Manchu deity Gesar. The temple is built according to both Chinese and Tibetan architecture. It was first erected in 1792 under the Qing dynasty and renovated around 2013 after decades of disrepair.

Built or rebuilt between 2014 and 2015 is the Guandi Temple of Qomolangma (Mount Everest), on Ganggar Mount, in Tingri County.

There are four mosques in the Tibet Autonomous Region with approximately 4,000 to 5,000 Muslim adherents, although a 2010 Chinese survey found a higher proportion of 0.4%. There is a Catholic church with 700 parishioners, which is located in the traditionally Catholic community of Yanjing in the east of the region.

==Human rights==
From the 1951 Seventeen Point Agreement to 2003, life expectancy in Tibet increased from thirty-six years to sixty-seven years with infant mortality and absolute poverty declining steadily.

Before the annexation of Tibet by the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1951, Tibet was ruled by a theocracy and had a caste-like social hierarchy. Human rights in Tibet prior to its incorporation into the People&#x27;s Republic of China differed considerably from those in the modern era. Due to tight control of press in mainland China, including the Tibet Autonomous Region, it is difficult to accurately determine the scope of human rights abuses.

When General Secretary Hu Yaobang visited Tibet in 1980 and 1982, he disagreed with what he viewed as heavy-handedness. Hu reduced the number of Han party cadre, and relaxed social controls.

Critics of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) say the CCP&#x27;s official aim to eliminate &quot;the three evils of separatism, terrorism and religious extremism&quot; is used as a pretext for human rights abuses. A 1992 Amnesty International report stated that judicial standards in the Tibet Autonomous Region were not up to &quot;international standards&quot;. The report charged the CCP government with keeping political prisoners and prisoners of conscience; ill-treatment of detainees, including torture, and inaction in the face of ill-treatment; the use of the death penalty; extrajudicial executions; and forced abortion and sterilization.

== Towns and villages in Tibet ==

=== Comfortable Housing Program ===
Beginning in 2006, 280,000 Tibetans who lived in traditional villages and as nomadic herdsmen have been forcefully relocated into villages and towns. In those areas, new housing was built and existing houses were remodelled to serve a total of 2 million people.
Those living in substandard housing were required to dismantle their houses and remodel them to government standards. Much of the expense was borne by the residents themselves, often through bank loans. The population transfer program, which was first implemented in Qinghai where 300,000 nomads were resettled, is called &quot;Comfortable Housing&quot;, which is part of the &quot;Build a New Socialist Countryside&quot; program. Its effect on Tibetan culture has been criticized by exiles and human rights groups. Finding employment is difficult for relocated persons who have only agrarian skills. Income shortfalls are offset by government support programs. It was announced that in 2011 that 20,000 CCP cadres will be placed in the new towns.

== Economy ==


In general, China&#x27;s minority regions have some of the highest per capita government spending public goods and services. Providing public goods and services in these areas is part of a government effort to reduce regional inequalities, reduce the risk of separatism, and stimulate economic development. Tibet has the highest amount of funding from the central government to the local government as of at least 2019.As of at least 2019, Tibet has the highest total per capita government expenditure of any region in China, including the highest per capita government expenditure on health care, the highest per capita government expenditure on education, and the second highest per capita government expenditure on social security and employment.

The Tibetans traditionally depended upon agriculture for survival. Since the 1980s, however, other jobs such as taxi-driving and hotel retail work have become available in the wake of Chinese economic reform. By 2023, its gross domestic product (GDP) stood at nearly 239.3 billion yuan (about 33.6 billion U.S. dollars), adding that the growth rates of the region&#x27;s major economic indicators, including per capita disposable income, fixed asset investment, and total retail sales of consumer goods, all ranked first in China. The added value of the service sector accounted for 54.1 percent and contributed a 57.6 percent share to economic growth. Investment in fixed assets also grew rapidly last year, with investment in infrastructure up by 34.8 percent and investment in areas related to people&#x27;s livelihoods up by 31.8 percent. The region&#x27;s GDP grew by an annual average of 9.5 percent from 2012 to 2023, about 3 percentage points higher than the China&#x27;s national average.

By 2022, the GDP of the region surpassed 213 billion yuan (US$31.7 billion in nominal), while GDP per capita reached ( in nominal). In 2022, Tibet&#x27;s GDP per capita ranked 25th highest in China, as well as higher than any South Asian country except Maldives. In 2008, Chinese news media reported that the per capita disposable incomes of urban and rural residents in Tibet averaged ( () and () respectively.

While traditional agriculture and animal husbandry continue to lead the area&#x27;s economy, in 2005 the tertiary sector contributed more than half of its GDP growth, the first time it surpassed the area&#x27;s primary industry.

The collection of caterpillar fungus (&quot;Cordyceps sinensis&quot;, known in Tibetan as &quot;Yartsa Gunbu&quot;) in late spring / early summer is in many areas the most important source of cash for rural households. It contributes an average of 40% to rural cash income and 8.5% to the Tibet Autonomous Region&#x27;s GDP.

The re-opening of the Nathu La pass (on southern Tibet&#x27;s border with India) should facilitate Sino-Indian border trade and boost Tibet&#x27;s economy.

The China Western Development policy was adopted in 2000 by the central government to boost economic development in western China, including the Tibet Autonomous Region. Because the central government permits Tibet to have a preferentially low corporate income tax rate, many corporations have registered in Tibet.

== Education ==
There are 4 universities and 3 special colleges in Tibet, including Tibet University, Tibet University for Nationalities, Tibet Tibetan Medical University, Tibet Agricultural and Animal Husbandry College, Lhasa Teachers College, Tibet Police College and Tibet Vocational and Technical College.

As of at least 2019, Tibet is the region of China with the largest per capita government spending on education.

== Tourism ==
Foreign tourists were first permitted to visit the Tibet Autonomous Region in the 1980s. While the main attraction is the Potala Palace in Lhasa, there are many other popular tourist destinations including the Jokhang Temple, Namtso Lake, and Tashilhunpo Monastery. Nonetheless, tourism in Tibet is still restricted for non-Chinese passport holders (including citizens of the Republic of China from Taiwan), and foreigners must apply for a Tibet Entry Permit to enter the region.

==Transportation==
A 2019 white paper from The State Council Information Office of the People&#x27;s Republic of China reported Tibet&#x27;s road system has achieved a total of 118,800 km.

=== Airports ===
The civil airports in Tibet are Lhasa Gonggar Airport, Qamdo Bangda Airport, Nyingchi Airport, and the Gunsa Airport.

Gunsa Airport in Ngari Prefecture began operations on 1 July 2010, to become the fourth civil airport in China&#x27;s Tibet Autonomous Region.

The Peace Airport for Xigazê was opened for civilian use on 30 October 2010.

Announced in 2010, Nagqu Dagring Airport was expected to become the world&#x27;s highest altitude airport, at 4,436 meters above sea level. However, in 2015 it was reported that construction of the airport has been delayed due to the necessity to develop higher technological standards.

=== Railway ===
The Qinghai–Tibet Railway from Golmud to Lhasa was completed on 12 October 2005. It opened to regular trial service on 1 July 2006. Five pairs of passenger trains run between Golmud and Lhasa, with connections onward to Beijing, Chengdu, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Xining and Lanzhou. The line includes the Tanggula Pass, which, at 5,072 m (16,640 ft) above sea level, is the world&#x27;s highest railway.

The Lhasa–Xigazê Railway branch from Lhasa to Xigazê was completed in 2014. It opened to regular service on 15 August 2014. The planned China–Nepal railway will connect Xigazê to Kathmandu, capital of Nepal, and is expected to be completed around 2027.

The construction of the Sichuan–Tibet Railway began in 2015. The line is expected to be completed around 2025.

<doc id="54761" wikidata="Q1093580" url="?curid=54761" title="Chinese surname">
<text>Chinese surnames are used by Han Chinese and Sinicized ethnic groups in Greater China, Korea, Vietnam and among overseas Chinese communities around the world such as Singapore and Malaysia. Written Chinese names begin with surnames, unlike the Western tradition in which surnames are written last. Around 2,000 Han Chinese surnames are currently in use, but the great proportion of Han Chinese people use only a relatively small number of these surnames; 19 surnames are used by around half of the Han Chinese people, while 100 surnames are used by around 87% of the population. A report in 2019 gives the most common Chinese surnames as Wang and Li, each shared by over 100 million people in China. The remaining eight of the top ten most common Chinese surnames are Zhang, Liu, Chen, Yang, Huang, Zhao, Wu and Zhou.

Two distinct types of Chinese surnames existed in ancient China, namely xing () ancestral clan names and shi () branch lineage names. Later, the two terms began to be used interchangeably, and in the present day, &quot;xing&quot; refers to the surname and &quot;shi&quot; may refer either the clan or maiden name. The two terms may also be used together as &quot;xingshi&quot; for family names or surnames. Most Chinese surnames (&quot;xing&quot;) in current use were originally &quot;shi&quot;. The earliest &quot;xing&quot; surname might be matrilinear, but Han Chinese family name has been exclusively patrilineal for a couple of millennia, passing from father to children. This system of patrilineal surnames is unusual in the world in its long period of continuity and depth of written history, and Chinese people may view their surnames as part of their shared kinship and Han Chinese identity. Women do not normally change their surnames upon marriage, except sometimes in places with more western influences such as Hong Kong. Traditionally Chinese surnames have been exogamous in that people tend to marry those with different surnames.

The most common Chinese surnames were compiled in the Song dynasty work &quot;Hundred Family Surnames&quot;, which lists over 400 names. The colloquial expressions &quot;lǎobǎixìng&quot; (老百姓; lit. &quot;old hundred surnames&quot;) and &quot;bǎixìng&quot; (, lit. &quot;hundred surnames&quot;) are used in Chinese to mean &quot;ordinary folks&quot;, &quot;the people&quot;, or &quot;commoners&quot;.

==History==

Chinese surnames have a history of over 3,000 years. Chinese mythology, however, reaches back further to the legendary figure Fuxi (with the surname Feng), who was said to have established the system of Chinese surnames to distinguish different families and prevent marriage of people with the same family names. Prior to the Warring States period (fifth century BC), only the ruling families and the aristocratic elite had surnames. Historically there was a difference between ancestral clan names or &quot;xing&quot; () and branch lineage names or &quot;shi&quot; (). &quot;Xing&quot; may be the more ancient surname that referred to the ancestral tribe or clan, while &quot;shi&quot; denoted a branch of the tribe or clan. For example, the ancestors of the Shang had &quot;Zi&quot; (子) as &quot;xing&quot;, but the descendants were subdivided into numerous &quot;shi&quot; including Yin (殷), Song (宋), Kong (空), Tong (同) and others. The distinction between the two began to be blurred by the Warring States period. During the Qin dynasty, name usage was standardised, commoners started to acquire a surname or &quot;xing&quot;, and the &quot;shi&quot; also became &quot;xing&quot;. By the Han dynasty, families only had &quot;xing&quot; or &quot;xing-shi&quot;. The great majority of Han Chinese surnames (now called &quot;xing&quot; or &quot;xingshi&quot;) that survive to modern times have their roots in &quot;shi&quot; rather than the ancient &quot;xing&quot;.

In modern usage, &quot;xing&quot; is the surname, but the word &quot;shi&quot; survives as a word to refer to the clan. The term &quot;shi&quot; may be appended to the surname of a person; for example, a man with the Zhang surname may be referred to respectfully as Zhang-&quot;shi&quot; instead of his full name. It is used in particular for the paternal surname of a married woman, therefore in this case &quot;shi&quot; means maiden name, which a Chinese woman would continue to use after marriage.

=== &quot;Xing&quot; ===

The ancient &quot;xing&quot; were surnames held by the noble clans. They generally contain a &quot;female&quot; () radical, for example Ji (), Jiang (), Yao () and Yíng (). This is taken as evidence that they originated from matriarchal societies based on maternal lineages. The character for &quot;xing&quot; itself is composed of a female radical and the character for &quot;give birth&quot; (生, &quot;shēng&quot;). &quot;Xing&quot; is believed to have been originally transmitted through women of noble birth, while noble men have &quot;shi&quot;.

Scholars such as Edwin G. Pulleyblank, however, are unconvinced by the matriarchy theory of Chinese surnames due to a lack of independent evidence. An alternative hypothesis has been proposed, suggesting that the use of female radical in &quot;xing&quot; may have arisen from the clan exogamy system used during the Zhou dynasty (the words &quot;xing&quot; and &quot;shi&quot; also did not exist in the Shang dynasty oracle bones). In ancient times, people of the same &quot;xing&quot; were not permitted to marry each other and a woman married into an aristocratic clan needed to be of a different name. Based on observation of the evolution of characters in oracular scripture from the Shang dynasty through the Zhou: the 女 radical seems to appear during the Zhou period next to Shang sinograms indicating a clan or a tribe. This combination seems to designate specifically a female and could mean &quot;lady of such or such clan&quot;. The structure of the &quot;xing&quot; sinogram could reflect the fact that in the royal court of Zhou, at least in the beginning, only females (wives married into the Zhou family from other clans) were called by their birth clan name, while the men were usually designated by their title or fief.

While people of the same &quot;xing&quot; were not permitted to marry each other, those with the same &quot;shi&quot; can. By the Han dynasty when everyone had &quot;xing&quot; and the surname was transmitted paternally, the practice continued, but it had changed to marriage between families of men on the paternal side being prohibited, but not on the maternal side.

===&quot;Shi&quot;===
Prior to the Qin dynasty (3rd century BC), China was largely a &quot;fengjian&quot; (feudal) society. As fiefdoms were divided and subdivided among descendants, so additional sub-surnames known as &quot;shi&quot; were created to distinguish between noble lineages according to seniority, though in theory they shared the same ancestor. In this way, a nobleman would hold a &quot;shi&quot; and a &quot;xing&quot;. &quot;Xing&quot;, however, was more important than &quot;shi&quot;.

The difference between &quot;xing&quot; and &quot;shi&quot; became blurred in the Spring and Autumn period starting with women. For example: Chunqiu referred to Duke Xuan of Lu&#x27;s consort Lady Mujiang (穆姜), who bore the clan name (姓, &quot;xing&quot;) Jiang, as &quot;Jiangshi&quot; 姜氏, &quot;[lady of the] Jiang &quot;shi&quot;&quot; (!).

After the states of China were unified by Qin Shi Huang in 221 BC, surnames gradually spread to the lower classes. Most surnames that survive to the present day were originally &quot;shi&quot;.

===Origins of Chinese surnames===
According to the chapter on surnames in the Han dynasty work &quot;Fengsu Tong – Xingshi Pian&quot; (風俗通姓氏篇), there are 9 origins of Chinese surnames: dynasty names, posthumous titles, ranks of nobility, state names, official positions, style names, places of residence, occupations, and events. Modern scholars such as Kiang Kang-Hu proposed that there are 18 sources from which Chinese surnames may be derived, while others suggested at least 24. These may be names associated with a ruling dynasty such as the various titles and names of rulers, nobility and dynasty, or they may be place names of various territories, districts, towns, villages, and specific locations, the title of official posts or occupations, or names of objects, or they may be derived from the names of family members or clans, and in a few cases, names of contempt given by a ruler.

The following are some of the common sources:

# Xing: These were usually reserved for the central lineage of the ancient royal family, with collateral lineages taking their own &quot;shi&quot;. The traditional description was what were known as the &quot;Eight Great &quot;Xing&quot;s of High Antiquity&quot; (), namely Jiāng (), Jī (), Yáo (), Yíng (), Sì (), Yún (), Guī () and Rèn (), though some sources quote Jí () as the last one instead of Rèn. Of these &quot;xing&quot;, only Jiang and Yao have survived in their original form to modern days as frequently occurring surnames.
# State name: Many nobles and commoners took the name of their state, either to show their continuing allegiance or as a matter of national and ethnic identity. These are some of the most common Chinese surnames in the present day such as Wú (, 9th most common), Zhōu (, 10th most common)
# Name of a fief or place of origin: Fiefdoms were often granted to collateral branches of the aristocracy and it was natural as part of the process of sub-surnaming for their names to be used. An example is Di, Marquis of Ouyang Village, whose descendants took the surname Ouyang (). There are some two hundred examples of this identified, often of two-character surnames, but few have survived to the present. Some families acquired their surname during the Han dynasty from the Commandery they resided in.
# Names of an ancestor: Like the previous example, this was also a common origin with close to 500 or 600 examples, 200 of which are two-character surnames. Often an ancestor&#x27;s courtesy name would be used. For example, Yuan Taotu took the second character of his grandfather&#x27;s courtesy name Boyuan () as his surname. Sometimes titles granted to ancestors could also be taken as surnames.
# Seniority within the family: In ancient usage, the characters &quot;zhong&quot; (), &quot;shu&quot; () and &quot;ji&quot; () were used to denote the second, third and fourth (or last) eldest sons in a family. For the first son &quot;meng&quot; () was meant for a child born to a secondary wife or a concubine, while &quot;bo&quot; indicated a child born to the primary wife. These were sometimes adopted as surnames. Of these, Meng is the best known, being the surname of the philosopher Mencius.
#Official positions, such as Shǐ (, &quot;historian&quot;), Jí (, &quot;royal librarian&quot;), Líng (, &quot;ice master&quot;), Cāng (, &quot;granary manager&quot;), Kù (, &quot;store manager&quot;), Jiàn (, &quot;adviser&quot;), Shàngguān (, &quot;high official&quot;), Tàishǐ (, &quot;grand historian&quot;), Zhōngháng (, &quot;commander of middle column&quot;), Yuèzhèng (, &quot;chief musician&quot;), and in the case of Shang&#x27;s &quot;Five Officials&quot; (), namely Sīmǎ (, &quot;minister of horses&quot;, akin to defence minister), Sītú (, &quot;minister of the masses&quot;, akin to treasurer), Sīkōng (, &quot;minister of works&quot;, akin to minister of infrastructure), Sīshì (, &quot;minister of yeomen&quot;, akin to chief ombudsman) and Sīkòu (, &quot;minister of bandits&quot;, akin to attorney general);
#General occupations, as with Táo (, &quot;potter&quot;), Tú (, &quot;butcher&quot;), Bǔ (, &quot;diviner&quot;), Jiàng (, &quot;craftsman&quot;), Wū (, &quot;shaman&quot;) and Chú (, &quot;cook&quot;).
# Titles of nobility, such as Wáng (, &quot;king&quot;), Hóu (, &quot;marquis&quot;), Xiàhóu (, &quot;Marquis of Xia&quot;) and Gōngsūn (, &quot;Duke&#x27;s grandchild&quot;)
# Royal decree by the Emperor, such as Kuang (), bestowed amongst other gifts to Kuang Yuping, previously Fang Yuping (方愈平), by Emperor Xiaozong of Song, upon making Yuping&#x27;s daughter an imperial concubine.
# Ethnic and religious groups: Non-Han Chinese peoples in China sometimes took the name of their ethnic groups as sinicized surnames, such as Hú (, &quot;barbarian&quot;), Jīn (, &quot;Jurchen&quot;), Mǎn (, &quot;Manchu&quot;), Dí (, &quot;Di people&quot;), Huí (, &quot;Hui people&quot;) and Mùróng (, a Xianbei tribe). Many Hui Muslims adopted the surname Ma (), an old Chinese surname, when they were required to use Chinese surnames during the Ming dynasty as it sounded close to the first syllable of Mohammad; it was also fitting for some of those who were caravaneers as the word means &quot;horse&quot;.
# Famous people: A couple of surnames originate from famous people in Chinese history. For example, the surname 李 originates from Lao Tzu. This probably means that people today with the surname 李 are mostly descendants of Lao Tzu, including the Tang emperors.

Many also changed their surnames throughout history for a number of reasons.

* A ruler may bestow his own surname on those he considered to have given outstanding service to him; for example, the surname Liu () was granted by emperors in the Han dynasty, Li () during the Tang dynasty, and Zhao () from the Song dynasty.
* Others, however, may avoid using the name of a ruler, for example Shi () was changed to Shuai () to avoid conflict with the name of Sima Shi. Others may modify their name in order to escape from their enemies at times of turmoil, for example Duanmu () to Mu ( and ), and Gong () to Gong ().
* The name may also be changed by simplification of the writing, e.g. Mu () to Mo (), or reducing from double or multiple character names to single character names, e.g. Duangan () to Duan ().
* It may also have occurred through error, or changed due to a dissatisfaction with the name (e.g. Ai , &quot;sorrow&quot;, to Zhong , &quot;heartfelt feeling&quot;).

==Usage==

Chinese surnames or family names are written &quot;before&quot; the first name or given name. Therefore, someone named Wei () from the Zhang () family is called &quot;Zhang Wei&quot; (张伟) and not &quot;Wei Zhang&quot;. Chinese women generally retain their maiden name and use their name unchanged after marriage, but in modern times in some communities, some women may choose to attach their husband&#x27;s surname to the front. Chinese surname is patrilinear where the father&#x27;s surname is passed on to his children, but more recently some people have opted to use both parents&#x27; surnames; although this practice has increased in recent times, it is still relatively uncommon in China, with those who adopted both parents&#x27; surnames numbering at only 1.1 million in 2018 (up from 118,000 in 1990).

Some Chinese outside of mainland China, particularly those from the Chinese immigrant communities around the world and those who have acquired a Christian or Western first name, have adopted the Western convention when giving their name in English, placing their surname last. Examples of those commonly known in the West include Jackie Chan (Chinese name Chan Kong-sang), Jimmy Choo (Chinese name Choo Yeang Keat), and Yo-Yo Ma. Those with a Western first name can write their name in English in various ways – some may add the Western first name in front and the Chinese given name last (the surname is therefore in the middle), or fully Westernised with both the Western and Chinese given names before the Chinese surname. Examples include Carrie Lam, originally named Cheng Yuet-ngor (Cheng is the surname), but who has acquired her husband&#x27;s surname Lam and a Western first name as Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor.

Due to the different spelling conventions and dialects as well as the different spelling preferences in the various countries these Chinese find themselves in, many people of the same Chinese surname can appear differently when written in English, for example the Lin surname (林) may also appear as Lam (Cantonese) or Lim (Hokkien). Some Chinese surnames that appear to be the same written in English may also be different in Chinese due to different characters having the same or similar pronunciations, dialectal differences, or non-standard romanizations (see section on variation in romanization below).

== Distribution of surnames ==
Surnames are not evenly distributed throughout China&#x27;s geography. In northern China, Wáng () is the most common surname, being shared by 9.9% of the population. Next are Lǐ (), Zhāng (/) and Liú (/). In the south, Chén (/) is the most common, being shared by 10.6% of the population. Next are Lǐ (李), Huáng (/), Lín () and Zhāng (张/張). Around the major crossing points of the Yangzi River, the most common surname is Lĭ (李), taking up 7.7%, followed by Wáng (王), Zhāng (张/張), Chan/Chén (陈/陳) and Liú (刘/劉).

A 1987 study showed over 450 family names in common use in Beijing, but there were fewer than 300 family names in Fujian. Furthermore, a 2012 study found that there was the lowest amount of isonymy in surnames among the population around middle and lower reaches of Yangtze River both on the provincial and county levels. Additionally, it was found that counties with the highest values of isonymy were distributed in the provinces with high proportions of ethnic minorities. According to the dendrogram of surname distances, several clusters could be identified. Most provinces in a cluster were conterminous with one another. The one exception to this pattern could be explained by demic migration observed where the Han Chinese migrated to Northeastern China.

A study by geneticist Yuan Yida has found that of all the people with a particular surname, there tends to be a population concentration in a certain province, as tabulated to the right. It does not show, however, the most common surnames in any one province.

The 55th most common family name &quot;Xiào&quot; () appears to be very rare in Hong Kong. This is explained by the fact Hong Kong uses traditional Chinese characters rather than simplified Chinese characters. Originally, the surname (Xiāo) was rather common while the surname 肖 (Xiào) was extremely rare, if not non-existent (it is mentioned only sporadically in historical texts). The first round of simplification in 1956 simplified 蕭 into , keeping 蕭/萧 and 肖 distinct. However the second-round in 1977, which has long been abolished, merged 萧 and 肖 into 肖. Despite the retraction of the second round, some people have kept 肖 as their surname, so that there are now two separate surnames, 萧 and 肖.

Chén (/) is perhaps the most common surname in Hong Kong and Macau, where it is romanized as Chan. It is the most common Chinese surname in Singapore, where it is usually romanized as Tan, and is also common in Taiwan, where it is romanized as Chén.

Fāng (), which is only the 47th most common overall, is much more common in San Francisco&#x27;s Chinatown in the United States, although the surname is more often than not romanized as Fong, as based on the Yue dialect. As with the concentration of family names, this can also be explained statistically, as a person with an uncommon name moving to an unsettled area and leaving his family name to large number of descendants.

After the Song dynasty, surname distributions in China largely settled down. The Kuàng (/) family, for example, migrated from the northern capital and settled in Guangdong after the Song dynasty revolts. Villages are often made up of a single patrilineage with individuals having the same surname, often with a common male ancestor. They usually intermarry with others from nearby villages, creating genetic clusters.

==Surnames at present==
Of the thousands of surnames which have been identified from historical texts prior to the modern era, most have either been lost (see extinction of family names) or simplified. Historically there are close to 12,000 surnames recorded including those from non-Han Chinese ethnic groups, of which only about 3,100 are in current use, a factor of almost 4:1 (about 75%) reduction. A 2019 figure however put the total number of Chinese family names at 6,150. Of Han Chinese surnames, the largest number ever recorded was 6,363 (3,730 single-character surnames, 2,633 multiple-character surnames), around 2,000 of which are still in use. Chinese Surname extinction is due to various factors, such as people taking the names of their rulers, orthographic simplifications, taboos against using characters from an emperor&#x27;s name, and others. A recent example of near surname extinction is the rare surname Shan (𢒉). The character may not be displayed on computer systems used by government officials, and people born after the system change as well as people who want to avoid possible problems changed their name to another character such as Xian (冼). The name is still used by the older people, but some people from the village are concerned that future generations will forget their name origin.

While new names have arisen for various reasons, this has been outweighed by old names disappearing. The most significant factor affecting the surname frequency is other ethnic groups identifying as Han and adopting Han names. In recent centuries some two-character surnames have often dropped a character. Since the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, moreover, some surnames have been graphically simplified.

Although there are thousands of Chinese family names, the 100 most common, which together make up less than 5% of those in existence, are shared by 85% of the population. The three most common surnames in Mainland China are Li, Wang and Zhang, which make up 7.9%, 7.4% and 7.1% respectively. Together they number close to 300 million and are easily the most common surnames in the world. In Chinese, the phrase &quot;third son of Zhang, fourth son of Li&quot; () is used to mean &quot;just anybody&quot;.

In a 1990 study, the top 200 family names accounted for over 96% of a random sample of 174,900 persons, with over 500 other names accounting for the remaining 4%. In a different study (1987), which combined data from Taiwan and China (sample size of 570,000 persons), the top 19 names covered 55.6%, and the top 100 names covered 87% of the sample. Other data suggest that the top 50 names comprise 70% of the population.

Most commonly occurring Chinese family names have only one character; however, about twenty double-character family names have survived into modern times. These include Sima ( , simp. ), Zhuge ( , simp. ), Ouyang ( , simp. ), occasionally romanized as &quot;O&#x27;Young&quot;, suggesting an Irish origin to English-speakers, and Situ (or Sito ). Sima, Zhuge, and Ouyang also happen to be the surnames of four well-known pre-modern Chinese historical figures. There are family names with three or more characters, but usually those are not ethnically Han Chinese. For example, Aixinjueluo (, also romanized from the Manchu language as Aisin Gioro), was the family name of the Manchu royal family of the Qing dynasty. The longest recorded surname written using hanzi characters is Lunalouyugumuzheshuduotumuku&#x27;adebu&#x27;axi (), an extremely rare surname reportedly used by members of the Yi ethnic group in Yunnan province, with seventeen characters in total.

===Variations in romanization===
Transliteration of Chinese family names (see List of common Chinese surnames) into foreign languages poses a number of problems. Chinese surnames are shared by people speaking a number of dialects and languages which often have different pronunciations of their surnames. The spread of the Chinese diaspora into all parts of the world resulted in the Romanization of the surnames based on different languages and Chinese dialects. Countries that have adopted the system of Chinese surnames such as Vietnam and Korea also spell them according to their own pronunciations. As a result, it is common for the same surname to be transcribed differently. For example, the Chen (陳) surname can appear as Chan (Cantonese, e.g. Jackie Chan), Tan (Hokkien), Tang (Teochew), Chin (Hakka), Trần (Vietnamese) and others; the Li (李) surname may appear as Lee (an example is Lee Kuan Yew), the Zhou (周) surname can appear as Chou, Chew, Jew and many others (e.g. Wakin Chau and Jimmy Choo); while the Zheng surname (鄭/郑) can be romanized into Chang, Cheng, Chung, Teh, Tay, Tee, Tsang, Zeng or Zheng (in pinyin, Chang, Cheng, Zheng and Zeng are all different names). In certain dialects, different surnames could be homonyms so it is common for family names to appear ambiguous when transliterated. Translating Chinese surnames from foreign transliteration often presents ambiguity. For example, the surname &quot;Li&quot; are all Mandarin-based pinyin transliteration for the surnames Lí (黎); Lǐ (李, 理 and 里); and Lì (郦/酈, 栗, 厉/厲, and 利) depending on the tone which is usually omitted in foreign transliterations.

Due to the different pronunciations and romanizations, it is sometimes easy to tell whether a Chinese person has origins in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, or Taiwan. Generally, people of Mainland descent will have their surnames and names in pinyin. Those from Taiwan use Wade-Giles romanization. People from Southeast Asia (mainly Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines) and Hong Kong usually base their romanization of surnames and names on the Min, Hakka and Cantonese languages. The younger generation from Singapore often has their surname in dialect ((Hokkien, Teochew, Hainanese, Cantonese, and Hakka) and given names in English, Mandarin, or both. 

Some people use non-standard romanizations, e.g. the Hong Kong media mogul 邵逸夫 Run Run Shaw&#x27;s surname 邵 is spelt as Shaw (Shao in pinyin).

The use of different systems of romanization based on different Chinese language variants from 1900~1970 also contributed to the variations.

Some examples:
Malaysia/Singapore/Indonesia/Philippines: various spellings are used depending on name origin.

See List of common Chinese surnames for the different spellings and more examples.

==Sociological use of surnames==

Throughout most of Chinese history, surnames have served sociological functions. Because of their association with the aristocratic elite in their early developments, surnames were often used as symbols of nobility. Thus nobles would use their surnames to be able to trace their ancestry and compete for seniority in terms of hereditary rank. Examples of early genealogies among the royalty can be found in Sima Qian&#x27;s &quot;Historical Records&quot;, which contain tables recording the descent lines of noble houses called &quot;shibiao&quot; ().

Later, during the Han dynasty, these tables were used by prominent families to glorify themselves and sometimes even to legitimize their political power. For example, Cao Pi, who forced the abdication of the last Han emperor in his favor, claimed descent from the Yellow Emperor. Chinese emperors sometimes passed their own surnames to subjects as honors. Unlike European practice in which some surnames are obviously noble, Chinese emperors and members of the royal family had regular surnames except in cases where they came from non-Han ethnic groups. This was a result of Chinese imperial theory in which a commoner could receive the Mandate of Heaven and become emperor. Upon becoming emperor, the emperor would retain his original surname. Also as a consequence, many people also had the same surname as the emperor, but had no direct relation to the royal family.

The Tang dynasty was the last period when the great aristocratic families, mostly descended from the nobility of pre-Qin states, held significant centralized and regional power. The surname was used as a source of prestige and common allegiance. During the period many genealogical records called &quot;pudie&quot; () were compiled to trace the complex descent lines of families or clans and their marriage ties to other families or clans. Many of these were collected by Ouyang Xiu in his &quot;New History of Tang&quot;. To differentiate between different surnames, the Tang also choronyms before stating beforehand, for example Lǒngxī Lǐshì 隴西李氏, meaning Li of Longxi. These were generally the names of commanderies used prior to the reorganization during the Tang, so that they became exclusively associated to clans as their common use had died out. Cadet branches were also listed for further differentiation, such as Gūzāng Fáng 姑臧房, meaning Clan Li of Guzang.

During the Song dynasty, ordinary clans began to organize themselves into corporate units and produce genealogies. This trend was led by the poet Su Shi and his father. As competition for resources and positions in the bureaucracy intensified, individuals used their common ancestry and surname to promote solidarity. They established schools to educate their sons and held common lands to aid disadvantaged families. Ancestral temples were also erected to promote surname identity. Clan cohesion was usually encouraged by successive imperial governments since it aided in social stability. During the Qing dynasty surname associations often undertook extrajudicial roles, providing primitive legal and social security functions. They played important roles in the Chinese diaspora to South-East Asia and elsewhere, providing the infrastructure for the establishment of trading networks. In southern China, however, clans sometimes engaged in armed conflict in competition for land. Clans continued the tradition of tracing their ancestry to the distant past as a matter of prestige. Most of these origin myths, though well established, are spurious.

As a result of the importance of surnames, rules and traditions regarding family and marriage grew increasingly complex. For example, in Taiwan, there is a clan with the so-called &quot;double Liao&quot; surname. The story is that &quot;Chang Yuan-zih of Liao&#x27;s in Siluo married the only daughter of Liao San-Jiou-Lang who had no son, and he took the oath that he should be in the name of Liao when alive and should be in the name of Chang after death.&quot; In some places, there are additional taboos against marriage between people of the same surname, considered to be closely related. Conversely, in some areas, there are different clans with the same surname which are not considered to be related, but even in these cases surname exogamy is generally practiced.

Surname identity and solidarity has declined markedly since the 1930s with the decline of Confucianism and later, the rise of Communism in Mainland China. During the Cultural Revolution, surname culture was actively persecuted by the government with the destruction of ancestral temples and genealogies. Moreover, the influx of Western culture and forces of globalization have also contributed to erode the previous sociological uses of the Chinese surnames.

==Common Chinese surnames==

=== Mainland China ===

According to a comprehensive survey of residential permits released by the Chinese Ministry of Public Security on 24 April 2007, the ten most common surnames in mainland China are Wang (王), Li (李), Zhang (张), Liu (刘), Chen (陈), Yang (杨), Huang (黄), Zhao (赵), Wu (吴), and Zhou (周). The same names were also found (in slightly different orders) by a fairly comprehensive survey of 296 million people in 2006, and by the 1982 census. The top 100 surnames cover 84.77% of China&#x27;s population. The top 10 surnames each have populations greater than 20 million. The MPS survey revealed that the top 3 surnames in China have a combined population larger than Indonesia, the world&#x27;s fourth-most-populous country.

The 2019 report by Chinese Ministry of Public Security gives the surnames Wang and Li as the most common ones, with each shared by over 100 million people in China. Each of the most common 23 surnames in China has more than 10 million users.

A commonly cited fact from the 1990 edition of the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; estimated that Zhang was the most common surname in the world, but no comprehensive information from China was available at the time and more recent editions have omitted the claim.

===Taiwan===
Names in Taiwanboth among the immigrant ethnic Chinese and indigenous Taiwanese peopleare similar to those in southeast China but differ somewhat from the distribution of names among all Han Chinese. According to a comprehensive survey of residential permits released by the Taiwanese Ministry of the Interior&#x27;s Department of Population in February 2005, the ten most common surnames in Taiwan are Chen (陳), Lin (林), Huang (黃), Chang or Zhang (張), Lee or Li (李), Wang (王), Wu (吳), Liu (劉), Tsai (蔡), and Yang (楊).

Taiwanese surnames include some local variants like Tu (塗), which do not even appear among the &quot;Hundred Family Surnames&quot;, as well as a number of recently created names that are fusions of various conventional surnames like Changchien (張簡) and Chiangfan (姜范). However, names in Taiwan show less diversity than China as a whole: the top ten comprise 52.63% of the Taiwanese population and the top hundred 96.11%. There were also only 1,989 surnames recorded by the Ministry&#x27;s survey, against China&#x27;s four or five thousand.

As is typical of China as a whole, these surnames conflate many different lineages and origins, although tradition may bind them to the same ancestral temples and rituals or ban intermarriage. For example, some Taiwanese converts to Presbyterianism adopted the name Kai (偕, pinyin &quot;Xié&quot;) in honor of the Canadian missionary George Leslie Mackay (馬偕, Pe̍h-ōe-jī &quot;Má-kai&quot;).

<text>Andrew Lloyd Webber, Baron Lloyd-Webber (born 22 March 1948) is an English composer and impresario of musical theatre. Several of his musicals have run for more than a decade both in the West End and on Broadway. He has composed 21 musicals, a song cycle, a set of variations, two film scores, and a Latin Requiem Mass.

Several of Lloyd Webber&#x27;s songs have been widely recorded and widely successful outside their parent musicals, such as &quot;Memory&quot; from &quot;Cats&quot;, &quot;The Music of the Night&quot; and &quot;All I Ask of You&quot; from &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know How to Love Him&quot; from &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry for Me Argentina&quot; from &quot;Evita&quot;, and &quot;Any Dream Will Do&quot; from &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot;. In 2001, &quot;The New York Times&quot; referred to him as &quot;the most commercially successful composer in history&quot;. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; named him in 2008 the fifth-most powerful person in British culture, on which occasion lyricist Don Black said that &quot;Andrew more or less single-handedly reinvented the musical.&quot;

Lloyd Webber has received numerous awards, including a knighthood in 1992, followed by a peerage for services to the arts, six Tonys, seven Olivier Awards, three Grammys (as well as the Grammy Legend Award), an Academy Award, 14 Ivor Novello Awards, a Golden Globe, a Brit Award, the 2006 Kennedy Center Honors, and two Classic Brit Awards (for Outstanding Contribution to Music in 2008, and for Musical Theatre and Education in 2018). In 2018, after &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert&quot; won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety Special (Live), he became the thirteenth person to win an Oscar, an Emmy, a Grammy, and a Tony. He has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, is an inductee into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and is a fellow of the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors.

The Really Useful Group, Lloyd Webber&#x27;s company, is one of the largest theatre operators in London. Producers in several parts of the UK have staged productions, including national tours, of Lloyd Webber musicals under licence from the Really Useful Group. He is also the president of the Arts Educational Schools, London, a performing arts school located in Chiswick, west London. Lloyd Webber is involved in a number of charitable activities, including the Elton John AIDS Foundation, Nordoff Robbins, Prostate Cancer UK and War Child. In 1992, he started the Andrew Lloyd Webber Foundation which supports the arts, culture, and heritage of the UK.

==Early life==
Lloyd Webber was born on 22 March 1948, at Westminster Hospital in London, the elder son of William Lloyd Webber (1914–1982), a composer and organist, and Jean Hermione Johnstone (1921–1993), a violinist and pianist. His younger brother, Julian Lloyd Webber, is a world-renowned solo cellist. On the BBC&#x27;s genealogy series &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;, he learned that his mother&#x27;s great-great-uncle was the soldier Sir Peregrine Maitland who in 1815 served as a major general at the Battle of Waterloo.

Lloyd Webber started writing his own music at a young age: a suite of six pieces at the age of nine. He also put on &quot;productions&quot; with Julian and his aunt Viola in his toy theatre (which he built at Viola&#x27;s suggestion). In his memoir, he writes: &quot;mum was determined that I should be a prodigy in something or other.&quot; His aunt Viola, an actress, took him to see many of her shows and through the stage door into the world of the theatre. His father enrolled him as a part-time student at the Eric Gilder School of Music in 1963. At this time he was working on a Genghis Khan musical called &quot;Westonia!&quot;.

From 1960 to 1965, Lloyd Webber was a Queen&#x27;s Scholar at Westminster School. An avid listener of 1960s rock and pop music, he called The Rolling Stones song &quot;(I Can&#x27;t Get No) Satisfaction&quot; the &quot;best record of the Sixties&quot;, and Dusty Springfield&#x27;s rendition of &quot;Son of a Preacher Man&quot; the song that taught him &quot;the power of a perfect pop song&quot;. He studied history for a term at Magdalen College, Oxford, although he abandoned the course in the winter of 1965 to study at the Royal College of Music in London and pursue his interest in musical theatre.

==Career==

===Early years===

In 1965, when Lloyd Webber was a 17-year-old budding musical-theatre composer, he was introduced to the 20-year-old aspiring pop-song writer Tim Rice. Their first collaboration was &quot;The Likes of Us&quot;, an &quot;Oliver!&quot;-inspired musical based on the true story of Thomas John Barnardo. They produced a demo tape of that work in 1966, but the project failed to gain a backer.

Although composed in 1965, &quot;The Likes of Us&quot; was not publicly performed until 2005, when a production was staged at Lloyd Webber&#x27;s Sydmonton Festival. In 2008, amateur rights were released by the National Operatic and Dramatic Association (NODA) in association with the Really Useful Group. The first amateur performance was by a children&#x27;s theatre group in Cornwall called &quot;Kidz R Us&quot;. Stylistically, &quot;The Likes of Us&quot; is fashioned after the Broadway musical of the 1940s and 1950s; it opens with a traditional overture comprising a medley of tunes from the show, and the score reflects some of Lloyd Webber&#x27;s early influences, particularly Richard Rodgers, Frederick Loewe, and Lionel Bart. In this respect, it is markedly different from the composer&#x27;s later work, which tends to be either predominantly or wholly through-composed, and closer in form to opera.

In the summer of 1967, Alan Doggett, a family friend of the Lloyd Webbers who had assisted on &quot;The Likes of Us&quot; and who was the music teacher at the Colet Court school in London, commissioned Lloyd Webber and Rice to write a piece for the school&#x27;s choir. Doggett requested a &quot;pop cantata&quot; along the lines of Herbert Chappell&#x27;s &quot;The Daniel Jazz&quot; (1963) and Michael Hurd&#x27;s &quot;Jonah-Man Jazz&quot; (1966), both of which had been published by Novello and were based on the Old Testament. The request for the new piece came with a 100-guinea advance from Novello. This resulted in &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot;, a retelling of the biblical story of Joseph, in which Lloyd Webber and Rice humorously pastiched a number of pop-music styles such as Elvis-style rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll, Calypso and country music. &quot;Joseph&quot; began life as a short cantata that gained some recognition on its second staging with a favourable review in &quot;The Times&quot;. For its subsequent performances, Rice and Lloyd Webber revised the show and added new songs to expand it to a more substantial length. Continued expansion eventually culminated in a 1972 stage musical and then a two-hour-long production being staged in the West End in 1973 on the back of the success of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;.

In 1969, Rice and Lloyd Webber wrote a song for the Eurovision Song Contest called &quot;Try It and See&quot;, which was not selected. With rewritten lyrics, it became &quot;King Herod&#x27;s Song&quot; in their third musical, &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; (1970). Debuting on Broadway in 1971, by 1980 the musical had grossed more than worldwide. Running for over eight years in London between 1972 and 1980, it held the record for longest-running West End musical before it was overtaken by &quot;Cats&quot; in 1989. The planned follow-up to &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; was a musical comedy based on the &quot;Jeeves and Wooster&quot; novels by P. G. Wodehouse. Tim Rice was uncertain about this venture, partly because of his concern that he might not be able to do justice to the novels that he and Lloyd Webber so admired. Rice backed out of the project and Lloyd Webber subsequently wrote the musical &quot;Jeeves&quot; with Alan Ayckbourn, who provided the book and lyrics. &quot;Jeeves&quot; failed to make any impact at the box office and closed after a run of only 38 performances in the West End in 1975. Many years later, Lloyd Webber and Ayckbourn revisited this project, producing a thoroughly reworked and more successful version entitled &quot;By Jeeves&quot; (1996).

===Mid-1970s===

Lloyd Webber collaborated with Rice once again to write &quot;Evita&quot; (1978), a musical based on the life of Eva Perón. As with &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;, &quot;Evita&quot; was released first as a concept album (1976) featuring Julie Covington singing the part of Eva Perón. The song &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry for Me Argentina&quot; became a hit single and the musical was staged at the West End&#x27;s Prince Edward Theatre in a production directed by Harold Prince and starring Elaine Paige in the title role. This original production was enormously successful, eventually running for nearly eight years in the West End.

&quot;Evita&quot; transferred to Broadway in 1979, in a production starring Patti LuPone as Eva and Mandy Patinkin as Che; it won seven Tony Awards, including Best Musical, helped launch the careers of both LuPone and Patinkin, and ran for almost four years. Rice and Lloyd Webber parted ways soon after &quot;Evita&quot;, although they have sporadically worked together since then.

In 1978, Lloyd Webber embarked on a project with his cellist brother Julian, the &quot;Variations&quot;, based on the 24th Caprice by Paganini; this reached number two in the pop album chart in the United Kingdom. The main theme was used as the theme tune for ITV&#x27;s long-running &quot;South Bank Show&quot; throughout its 32-year run. The same year, Lloyd Webber also composed a new theme tune for the long-running documentary series &quot;Whicker&#x27;s World&quot;, which was used from 1978 to 1980. He also composed the instrumental &quot;Argentine Melody&quot; as the theme music for the BBC&#x27;s coverage of the 1978 FIFA World Cup held in Argentina.

===1980s===

Lloyd Webber was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in November 1980 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews in the foyer of Thames Television&#x27;s Euston Road Studios in London. He would be honoured a second time by the television programme in November 1994 when Michael Aspel surprised him at the West End&#x27;s Adelphi Theatre.

Lloyd Webber embarked on his next project without a lyricist, turning instead to the poetry of T. S. Eliot. &quot;Cats&quot; (1981) was to become the longest-running musical in London, where it ran for 21 years and 8,949 performances before closing. On Broadway, &quot;Cats&quot; ran for 18 years, a record which would ultimately be broken by another Lloyd Webber musical, &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;. Elaine Paige collaborated again with Lloyd Webber, originating the role of Grizabella in &quot;Cats&quot;, and had a Top 10 UK hit with &quot;Memory&quot;.

&quot;Starlight Express&quot; (1984) was a commercial hit, but received negative reviews from the critics. It ran for 7,409 performances in London, making it the ninth longest-running West End show. It ran for less than two years on Broadway. The show has also seen two tours of the US, as well as an Australian/Japanese production, a three-year UK touring production, which transferred to New Zealand later in 2009. &quot;Starlight Express&quot; runs full-time in a custom-built theatre in Bochum, Germany, where it has been running since 1988. The German production holds the &quot;Guinness World Record&quot; for most visitors to a musical in a single theatre.

Lloyd Webber wrote a Requiem Mass dedicated to his father, William, who had died in 1982. It premiered at St. Thomas Church in New York on 24 February 1985. Church music had been a part of the composer&#x27;s upbringing and the composition was inspired by an article he had read about the plight of Cambodian orphans. Lloyd Webber had on a number of occasions written sacred music for the annual Sydmonton Festival. Lloyd Webber received a Grammy Award in 1986 for &quot;Requiem&quot; in the category of best classical composition. &quot;Pie Jesu&quot; from Requiem achieved a high placing on the UK Singles Chart and was certified silver. Perhaps because of its large orchestration, live performances of the Requiem are rare.

In 1986, Prince Edward, the youngest son of Queen Elizabeth II, commissioned a short musical from Lloyd Webber and Rice for his mother&#x27;s 60th birthday celebration. &quot;Cricket&quot; (1986), also called &quot;Cricket (Hearts and Wickets)&quot;, reunited Lloyd Webber with Rice to create this short musical for the Queen&#x27;s birthday, first performed at Windsor Castle. Several of the tunes were later used for &quot;Aspects of Love&quot; and &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;.

Lloyd Webber premiered &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre in the West End in 1986, inspired by the 1911 Gaston Leroux novel. He wrote the part of Christine for his then wife, Sarah Brightman, who played the role in the original London and Broadway productions alongside Michael Crawford as the Phantom. The production was directed by Harold Prince, who had also earlier directed &quot;Evita&quot;. Charles Hart wrote the lyrics for &quot;Phantom&quot; with some additional material provided by Richard Stilgoe, with whom Lloyd Webber co-wrote the book of the musical. It became a hit and is still running in the West End; in January 2006 it overtook Lloyd Webber&#x27;s &quot;Cats&quot; as the longest-running show on Broadway. On 11 February 2012, &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot; played its 10,000th show on Broadway. With over 14,200 London productions it is the second longest-running West End musical. The Broadway production closed on 16 April 2023, having played 13,981 performances, the most in Broadway history.

&quot;Aspects of Love&quot; followed in 1989, a musical based on the story by David Garnett. The lyrics were by Don Black and Charles Hart and the original production was directed by Trevor Nunn. &quot;Aspects&quot; had a run of four years in London, but closed after less than a year on Broadway. It has since gone on a tour of the UK. It is famous for the song &quot;Love Changes Everything&quot;, which was performed by Michael Ball in both the West End and Broadway casts. It stayed in the UK Singles Chart for 14 weeks, peaking at number 2 and becoming Ball&#x27;s signature tune.

===1990s===

Lloyd Webber was asked to write a song for the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona and he composed &quot;Amigos Para Siempre — Friends for Life&quot; with Don Black providing the lyrics. This song was performed by Sarah Brightman and José Carreras.

Lloyd Webber had toyed with the idea of writing a musical based on Billy Wilder&#x27;s critically acclaimed movie, &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;, since seeing the film in the early 1970s, but the project did not come to fruition until after the completion of &quot;Aspects of Love&quot; when the composer finally managed to secure the rights from Paramount Pictures, The composer worked with two collaborators, as he had done on &quot;Aspects of Love&quot;; this time Christopher Hampton and Don Black shared equal credit for the book and lyrics. &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; opened at the Adelphi Theatre in London on 12 July 1993, and ran for 1,529 performances.

In 1994, &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; became a successful Broadway show, opening with the largest advance in Broadway history, and winning seven Tony Awards that year. Even so, by its closing in 1997, &quot;it had not recouped its reported $13 million investment.&quot; From 1995 to 2000, Lloyd Webber wrote the Matters of Taste column in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; where he reviewed restaurants and hotels, and these were illustrated by Lucinda Rogers.

In 1998, Lloyd Webber released a film version of &quot;Cats&quot;, which was filmed at the Adelphi Theatre in London. David Mallet directed the film, and Gillian Lynne choreographed it. The cast consisted of performers who had been in the show before, including Ken Page (the original Old Deuteronomy on Broadway), Elaine Paige (original Grizabella in London) and John Mills as Gus: the Theatre Cat.

In 1998, &quot;Whistle Down the Wind&quot; made its debut, a musical written with lyrics supplied by Jim Steinman. Originally opening in Washington, Lloyd Webber was reportedly not happy with the casting or Harold Prince&#x27;s production and the show was subsequently revised for a London staging directed by Gale Edwards. The production included the Boyzone number-one hit &quot;No Matter What&quot;, which remained at the top of the UK charts for three weeks. His &quot;The Beautiful Game&quot; opened in London and has never been seen on Broadway. The show had a respectable run at The Cambridge Theatre in London. The show was re-worked into a new musical, &quot;The Boys in the Photograph&quot;, which had its world première at The Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts in April 2008.

===2000s===
Having achieved great popular success in musical theatre, Lloyd Webber was referred to by &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2001 as &quot;the most commercially successful composer in history&quot;. In 2002 he turned producer, bringing the musical &quot;Bombay Dreams&quot; to London. With music by Indian Music composer A.R. Rahman and lyrics by Don Black, it ran for two years at the Apollo Victoria Theatre. A revised Broadway production at the Broadway Theatre two years later ran for only 284 performances. On 16 September 2004, his production of &quot;The Woman in White&quot; opened at the Palace Theatre in London. It ran for 19 months and 500 performances. A revised production opened on Broadway at the Marquis Theatre on 17 November 2005. Garnering mixed reviews from critics, due in part to the frequent absences of the show&#x27;s star Maria Friedman due to breast cancer treatment, it closed only a brief three months later on 19 February 2006.

Lloyd Webber produced a staging of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, which débuted in November 2006. He made the controversial decision to choose an unknown to play leading lady Maria, who was found through the BBC&#x27;s reality television show &quot;How Do You Solve a Problem like Maria?&quot;, in which he was a judge. The winner of the show was Connie Fisher. A 2006 project, &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot;, was abandoned in 2007.

In September 2006, Lloyd Webber was named a recipient of the Kennedy Center Honors with Zubin Mehta, Dolly Parton, Steven Spielberg, and Smokey Robinson. He was recognised for his outstanding contribution to American performing arts. He attended the ceremony on 3 December 2006; it aired on 26 December 2006. On 11 February 2007, Lloyd Webber was featured as a guest judge on the reality television show &quot;&quot;.

Between April and June 2007, he appeared in BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Any Dream Will Do!&quot;, which followed the same format as &quot;How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria?&quot;. Its aim was to find a new Joseph for his revival of &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot;. Lee Mead won the contest. Viewers&#x27; telephone voting during the series raised more than £500,000 for the BBC&#x27;s annual &quot;Children in Need&quot; charity appeal, according to host Graham Norton on air during the final.

In 2007, Lloyd Webber&#x27;s cat, Otto, leaped onto his Clavinova piano and &quot;destroyed the entire score for the new &#x27;Phantom&#x27; in one fell swoop&quot;. The Phantom in question was &quot;The Phantom of Manhattan&quot;, a planned sequel to &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;. On 1 July 2007, Lloyd Webber presented excerpts from his musicals as part of the Concert for Diana held at Wembley Stadium, London, an event organised to celebrate the life of Princess Diana almost 10 years after her death. BBC Radio 2 broadcast a concert of music from the Lloyd Webber musicals on 24 August 2007. Denise Van Outen introduced songs from &quot;Whistle Down the Wind&quot;, &quot;The Beautiful Game&quot;, &quot;Tell Me on a Sunday&quot;, &quot;The Woman in White&quot;, &quot;Evita&quot; and &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot; – as well as Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, which Lloyd Webber revived in 2006 at the London Palladium, and the 2002 musical &quot;Bombay Dreams&quot;.

In April 2008, Lloyd Webber reprised his role as judge, this time in the BBC musical talent show &quot;I&#x27;d Do Anything&quot;. The show followed a similar format to its &quot;Maria&quot; and &quot;Joseph&quot; predecessors, this time involving a search for an actress to play the role of Nancy in a West End production of Lionel Bart&#x27;s &quot;Oliver!&quot;, a musical based on the Charles Dickens&#x27; novel &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;. The show also featured a search for three young actors to play and share the title character&#x27;s role, but the show&#x27;s main focus was on the search for Nancy. The role was won by Jodie Prenger despite Lloyd Webber&#x27;s stated preference for one of the other contestants; the winners of the Oliver role were Harry Stott, Gwion Wyn-Jones and Laurence Jeffcoate. Also in April 2008, Lloyd Webber was featured on the U.S. talent show &quot;American Idol&quot;, acting as a mentor when the 6 finalists had to select one of his songs to perform for the judges that week.

Lloyd Webber accepted the challenge of managing the UK&#x27;s entry for the 2009 Eurovision Song Contest, to be held in Moscow. In early 2009 a series, called &quot;&quot;, was broadcast to find a performer for a song that he would compose for the competition. Jade Ewen won the right to represent Britain, winning with &quot;It&#x27;s My Time&quot;, by Lloyd Webber and Diane Warren. At the contest, Lloyd Webber accompanied her on the piano during the performance. The United Kingdom finished fifth in the contest.

On 8 October 2009, Lloyd Webber launched the musical &quot;Love Never Dies&quot; at a press conference held at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, where the original &quot;Phantom&quot; has been running since 1986. Also present were Sierra Boggess, who had been cast as Christine Daaé, and Ramin Karimloo, who portrayed Phantom, a role he had recently played in the West End.

===2010s===
Following the opening of &quot;Love Never Dies&quot;, Lloyd Webber again began a search for a new musical theatre performer in the BBC One series &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot;. He cast the winner, Danielle Hope, in the role of Dorothy Gale, and a dog to play Toto in his forthcoming stage production of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. He and lyricist and composer Tim Rice wrote a number of new songs for the production to supplement the songs from the film.
On 1 March 2011, &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; opened at The Palladium Theatre, starring Hope as Dorothy Gale and Michael Crawford as the Wizard of Oz. In 2012, Lloyd Webber fronted a new ITV primetime show &quot;Superstar&quot; which gave the UK public the chance to decide who would play the starring role of Jesus in an arena tour of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;. The arena tour started in September 2012 and also starred comedian Tim Minchin as Judas Iscariot, former Spice Girl Melanie C as Mary Magdalene and BBC Radio 1 DJ Chris Moyles as Herod Antipas. Tickets for most venues went on sale on 18 May 2012.

In 2013, Lloyd Webber reunited with Christopher Hampton and Don Black on &quot;Stephen Ward the Musical&quot;. For his next project, a 2015 musical adaptation of the 2003 film &quot;School of Rock&quot;, auditions were held for children aged nine to fifteen in cooperation with the School of Rock music education program, which predated the film by several years.

In April 2016, the English National Opera staged a revival of &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; at the London Coliseum. The limited run, semi-staged production directed by Lonny Price brought Glenn Close to reprise her star turn as Norma Desmond, which was her first time performing the role in London; she had originated the role in Los Angeles in December 1993 and then on Broadway in November 1994 (which won her the 1995 Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical). The 2016 London revival was so well-received that the production transferred to the Palace Theatre on Broadway in February 2017, making Lloyd Webber the first musical-theatre composer since 1953 to have four musicals running simultaneously on Broadway – a feat that his heroes Rodgers and Hammerstein had previously achieved.

Lloyd Webber&#x27;s memoir, &quot;Unmasked&quot;, was published in 2018. On 9 September 2018, Lloyd Webber, along with Tim Rice and John Legend each won an Emmy for &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert&quot;. With this win, Lloyd Webber, Rice and Legend joined the list of people who have won Academy, Emmy, Grammy, and Tony Awards. Lloyd Webber wrote the song &quot;Beautiful Ghosts&quot; with Taylor Swift for the film adaptation of &quot;Cats&quot;, produced by Greg Wells and released in December 2019. In an interview in August 2020, Lloyd Webber called the film &quot;ridiculous&quot; in the ways that it changed the musical: &quot;The problem with the film was that Tom Hooper decided that he didn&#x27;t want anybody involved in it who was involved in the original show.&quot; He said that seeing the film caused him to get a dog.

===2020s===

Lloyd Webber&#x27;s new version of &quot;Cinderella&quot; opened at the Gillian Lynne Theatre in the West End in 2021. The opening, which was originally set to take place in August 2020, was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on a book by Emerald Fennell, Lloyd Webber wrote: &quot;Emerald Fennell has written something truly exciting and original, and the moment I read her outline I knew I&#x27;d found my latest collaborator.&quot; He garnered press attention in July 2021 for saying that he was &quot;prepared to be arrested&quot; to open &quot;Cinderella&quot; to full houses in spite of rising Covid cases and in defiance of Government advice. A 2021 feature in &quot;Variety&quot; suggested: 

In 2022, Lloyd Webber appeared alongside Lin-Manuel Miranda in the BBC Platinum Jubilee Concert for Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II. They initially appeared singing alternative words to &quot;The King&#x27;s Song&quot; from &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; and &quot;Any Dream Will Do&quot; from &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot; and &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; from &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; were parts of the musical theatre section. In 2023, Lloyd Webber was one of twelve composers asked to write a new piece for the coronation of Charles III and Camilla. His anthem, &quot;Make a Joyful Noise&quot;, was performed during the enthronement of Queen Camilla. 

In 2024, Lloyd Webber announced that his next musical will be an adaptation of the 2006 film &quot;The Illusionist&quot;, which will feature lyrics by Bruno Major, book by Chris Terrio and will be directed by Jamie Lloyd and produced by Michael Harrison (following the 2023 and 2024 London and Broadway revivals of &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;). In 2025, Lloyd Webber will reunite with Tim Rice to create the original songs for &quot;Sherlock Holmes and the 12 Days of Christmas&quot;, a comedy whodunit play written by Humphrey Ker and David Reed (members of the British sketch comedy troupe The Penny Dreadfuls) which will premiere at the Birmingham Rep for the Christmas season.

==Accusations of plagiarism==
Among the accusations of plagiarism that Lloyd Webber has received, the Dutch composer Louis Andriessen stated that he: &quot;has yet to think up a single note; in fact, the poor guy&#x27;s never invented one note by himself. That&#x27;s rather poor&quot;. Lloyd Webber&#x27;s biographer, John Snelson, acknowledged a similarity between the &quot;andante&quot; movement of Mendelssohn&#x27;s Violin Concerto in E minor and the &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; song &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know How to Love Him&quot;, but wrote that Lloyd Webber:
An accusation of plagiarism regarded the 1971 Pink Floyd album &quot;Meddle&quot;. The sixth track of the album, &quot;Echoes&quot;, has a riff on which Lloyd Webber allegedly based the opening organ riff in &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;. The two riffs share very similar notes and the order of the notes played. Lloyd Webber&#x27;s pipe organ riff from &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot; plays D, C, C, B, A, then ascending A, B, C, C, D. Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Echoes&quot; plays C, C, B, A, A, then ascending A, A, B, C, C. Pink Floyd bassist and co-lead vocalist Roger Waters pointed this out and said it was &quot;probably actionable&quot;, but stated that he did not care to take it to court.

Noting similarities between Lloyd Webber&#x27;s &quot;The Music of the Night&quot; and a recurring melody in Giacomo Puccini&#x27;s 1910 opera, &quot;La fanciulla del West&quot; (&quot;The Girl of the Golden West&quot;), in 1987 the Puccini estate filed a lawsuit against Lloyd Webber, accusing him of plagiarism. The case was settled out of court, but details were not released to the public. The songwriter Ray Repp claimed in a court case that Lloyd Webber had stolen a melody from his own song &quot;Till You&quot;, but the court ruled in Lloyd Webber&#x27;s favour.

==Personal life==
Lloyd Webber has been married three times. He married first Sarah Hugill, youngest daughter of Lieutenant-Commander Antony Hugill and Fanny &quot;née&quot; Gore Browne, on 24 July 1971; they divorced on 14 November 1983. Together they had two children, a daughter and a son:
*Imogen Lloyd Webber (born 31 March 1977)
*Nicholas Lloyd Webber (2 July 1979 – 25 March 2023)

He then married English soprano Sarah Brightman on 22 March 1984, in Hampshire. He cast Brightman in the lead role in his musical &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, among other notable roles. They divorced on 3 January 1990, but have remained close friends and have also continued to work together.

Thirdly, he married Madeleine Gurdon in Westminster on 9 February 1991. They have three children, two sons and one daughter.

Lloyd Webber and his third wife Madeleine founded the Watership Down Stud in 1992. In 1996, they expanded their equestrian holdings by purchasing Kiltinan Castle Stud near Fethard in County Tipperary, Ireland. They were invited to ride in the King&#x27;s procession at Royal Ascot 2023.

In a 1971 interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Lloyd Webber said he is an agnostic. He also said he views Jesus as &quot;one of the great figures of history&quot;.

He is a lifelong supporter of London-based football club Leyton Orient F.C., as is his younger brother Julian.

In late 2009, Lloyd Webber had surgery for early-stage prostate cancer, but had to be readmitted to hospital with post-operative infection in November. In January 2010, he declared he was cancer-free. He had his prostate completely removed as a preventative measure.

In 2023, Lloyd Webber&#x27;s son Nicholas died at the age of 43 after an 18-month battle with gastric cancer.

Lloyd Webber has a house in Eaton Square in Belgravia, London; in 2024 he revealed he had had his house blessed by a priest in an attempt to displace a &quot;poltergeist&quot; that was haunting the property.

==Wealth==
The &quot;Sunday Times Rich List 2006&quot; ranked him the 87th-richest person in Britain with an estimated fortune of £700 million. His wealth increased to £750 million in 2007, but the publication ranked him 101st in 2008. &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; Rich List of 2019 saw him ranked the richest musician in the UK (overtaking Paul McCartney) with a fortune of £820 million ($1.074 billion). He lives at Sydmonton Court, Hampshire, and owns much of nearby Watership Down.

Lloyd Webber is an art collector, with a passion for Victorian painting. An exhibition of works from his collection was presented at the Royal Academy in 2003 under the title &quot;Pre-Raphaelite and Other Masters – The Andrew Lloyd Webber Collection&quot;. In 2006, Lloyd Webber planned to sell &quot;Portrait of Angel Fernández de Soto&quot; by Pablo Picasso to benefit the Andrew Lloyd Webber Foundation. In November 2006, he withdrew the painting from auction after a claim that the previous owner had been forced to sell it under duress in Nazi Germany. An out-of-court settlement was reached, where the foundation retained ownership rights. On 23 June 2010, the painting was sold at auction for £34.7 million to an anonymous telephone bidder.

==Charity==

Lloyd Webber is involved in a number of charitable activities, including the Elton John AIDS Foundation, Nordoff Robbins, Prostate Cancer UK and War Child. In 1992, he started the Andrew Lloyd Webber Foundation which supports the arts, culture, and heritage of the UK.

In 2013, the Andrew Lloyd Webber Programme was launched to aid the Music in Secondary Schools Trust (MiSST), which aims to give every child at participating schools across the UK the opportunity to study a musical instrument as part of the curriculum. He told LBC: &quot;What music does in these schools, isn&#x27;t actually necessarily about trying to make the children musicians. But what it does, is it really helps them as people.&quot;

In 2014, Lloyd Webber designed a &quot;Cats&quot;-themed Paddington Bear statue, which was located in Chinatown, London (one of 50 placed around London), with the statues auctioned to raise funds for the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC).

==Politics==
Lloyd Webber was made a life peer in 1997, sitting for the Conservative Party. By the end of 2015, he had voted only 33 times in the House of Lords. Politically, Lloyd Webber has supported the Conservatives, allowing his song &quot;Take That Look Off Your Face&quot; to be used on a party promotional film seen by an estimated one million people before the 2005 general election. In August 2014, Lloyd Webber was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; opposing Scottish independence in the run-up to September&#x27;s referendum on that issue.

In October 2015, Lloyd Webber was involved in a contentious House of Lords vote over proposed cuts to tax credits, voting with the Government in favour of the plan. Lloyd Webber was denounced by his critics because he flew in from abroad on his personal plane to vote, when his voting record was scant. In October 2017, Lloyd Webber retired from the House of Lords, stating that his busy schedule was incompatible with the demands of Parliament considering the upcoming crucial Brexit legislation.

In July 2021, he told &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot; that he would never vote for the Conservatives again, due to their handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and poor treatment of the arts sector during that time.
==Awards and honours==

Lloyd Webber was knighted in the Queen&#x27;s 1992 Birthday Honours for services to the arts. He was given a life peerage in the 1997 New Year Honours and created Baron Lloyd-Webber, of Sydmonton in the County of Hampshire, on 18 February 1997. He is properly styled &quot;The Lord Lloyd-Webber&quot;; the title is hyphenated, although his surname is not. He sat as a Conservative member of the House of Lords until his retirement from the House on 17 October 2017.

On St George&#x27;s Day 2024, he was appointed a Knight Companion of the Order of the Garter (KG).

==Film adaptations==
There have been a number of film adaptations of Lloyd Webber&#x27;s musicals: &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; (1973), directed by Norman Jewison; &quot;Evita&quot; (1996), directed by Alan Parker; &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; (2004), directed by Joel Schumacher and co-produced by Lloyd Webber; and &quot;Cats&quot; (2019), directed by Tom Hooper and executive produced by Lloyd Webber. &quot;Cats&quot; (1998), &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot; (1999), &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; (2000) and &quot;By Jeeves&quot; (2001) have been adapted into made-for-television films that have been released on DVD and VHS and often air on BBC.

A special performance of &quot;The Phantom of the Opera at the Royal Albert Hall&quot; for the 25th anniversary was broadcast live to cinemas in early October 2011 and later released on DVD and Blu-ray in February 2012. The same was also done with a reworked version of &quot;Love Never Dies&quot;. Filmed in Melbourne, it received a limited cinema release in the US and Canada in 2012, to see if it would be viable to bring the show to Broadway.

==Other works==
*&quot;Gumshoe&quot; (1971) - film score
*&quot;The Odessa File&quot; (1974) – Film score.
*&quot;Variations&quot; (1978) – A set of musical variations on Niccolò Paganini&#x27;s Caprice in A minor that Lloyd Webber composed for his brother, cellist Julian. This album featured fifteen rock musicians including guitarist Gary Moore and pianist Rod Argent and reached number 2 in the UK album chart upon its release. It was later combined with &quot;Tell Me on a Sunday&quot; to form one show, &quot;Song and Dance&quot;. Lloyd Webber also used variation five as the basis for &quot;Unexpected Song&quot; in Song and Dance. The main theme is used as the theme music to &quot;The South Bank Show&quot;.
*&quot;Requiem&quot; (1985) – A classical choral work composed in honour of his father, William.
*&quot;Watership Down&quot; (1999) – Lloyd Webber and Mike Batt, main soundtrack composer of the animated series adaptation of Richard Adams&#x27; novel of the same name, composed the song &quot;Fields of Sun&quot;. The actual song was never used on the show, nor was it available on the CD soundtrack that was released at the time. He was however still credited for the unused song in the show&#x27;s opening titles.

<text>War (also known as Battle in the United Kingdom) is a simple card game, typically played by two players using a standard playing card deck — and often played by children. There are many variations, as well as related games such as the German 32-card Tod und Leben (&quot;Death and Life&quot;).

==Rules==

The objective of the game is to win all of the cards.

The deck is divided evenly among the players, giving each a down stack. In unison, each player reveals the top card of their deck—this is a &quot;battle&quot;—and the player with the higher card takes both of the cards played and moves them to their stack. Aces are high, and suits are ignored.

If the two cards played are of equal value, then there is a &quot;war&quot;. Both players place the next card from their pile face down and then another card face-up. The owner of the higher face-up card wins the war and adds all the cards on the table to the bottom of their deck. If the face-up cards are again equal then the battle repeats with another set of face-down/up cards. This repeats until one player&#x27;s face-up card is higher than their opponent&#x27;s.

Most descriptions of War are unclear about what happens if a player runs out of cards during a war. In some variants, that player immediately loses. In others, the player may play the last card in their deck as their face-up card for the remainder of the war or replay the game from the beginning. There also exists a variant where the player that possesses a larger amount of cards must provide the cards to fight the war.

War can also be played by multiple people. Each player in a three-player game receives 17 cards, while each person in a four-player game receives 13. Each player must simultaneously reveal their card, just like in the two-player version. If the highest cards played are tied, they will go to war. All players, including those who are not tied, will play one face-down card and the following face-up card. The person who has the highest card at the end of the war obtains all of the cards that have been played. When a player runs out of cards, they are eliminated and are no longer in the game. The game will continue until one player has collected all of the cards. 

Game designer Greg Costikyan has observed that since there are no choices in the game, and all outcomes are random, it cannot be considered a game by some definitions. However, the rules often do not specify in which order the cards should be returned to the deck. If they are returned in a non-random order, the decision of putting one card before another after a victory can change the overall outcome of the game. The effects of such decisions are more visible with smaller size decks as it is easier for a player to card count; however, the decisions can still affect gameplay if taken in standard decks.

== Variations ==
Being a widely known game, War has many variations. Recorded variants include:

;Casino War: A simple variation played for money in casinos.
;Three cards: Many play with three cards being played face-down during a war.
;Prisoners of War: Usually played with more than 2 players. When a player wins a battle, they can choose to take one of the cards as &quot;prisoner&quot;; this must not be one of their own cards. If they do, they put the card face up in front of them, away from the discard pile and the deck. When another battle is started, a player may choose to not play a card from their deck, and instead of the &quot;prisoner&quot; card. (They cannot look at the card they would have drawn and then choose to play the prisoner.) If a player wins the battle, it works like a regular one. If they lose, however, they give the winner the card they played as well as the card they would have drawn if they chose not to play the &quot;prisoner&quot; card. If a war is initiated, it works the same way. If a player wins a war, they can also choose to &quot;capture&quot; one of the face-down cards.
;Bettelmann (&quot;Beggar Man&quot;) and Tod und Leben (&quot;Life and Death&quot;): German variants mentioned as early as 1833. Uses a 32-card Skat pack for 2 players with cards ranking in the natural order and suits being irrelevant, except that in Tod und Leben, one player plays with the red suits and the other with the black suits. Players get 16 cards each face down. They turn over their top cards at the same time and the higher card wins. If the cards are equal, players turn the next card and the winner takes all four cards. The player with the most cards at the end wins.
;Automatic War: Laying down a two of any suit causes a War to be declared. 
;Peace: The opposite of War, in that the lowest card always wins.
;Underdog: The losing player of a War steals the victory if one of their three discard cards is a Jack.

He was a high-ranking Song dynasty scholar-official who authored the &quot;Zizhi Tongjian&quot;, a monumental work of history. Sima was a political conservative who opposed the reforms of Wang Anshi.

==Early life and career==
Sima Guang was named after Guang Prefecture, his birthplace, and where his father Sima Chi () served as a county magistrate. The Sima family were originally from Xia County in Shǎn Prefecture, and claimed descent from the 3rd century Cao Wei official Sima Fu. A famous anecdote relates the young Sima Guang saving a playmate who had fallen into an enormous vat full of water. As other children scattered in panic, Sima calmly picked up a rock and smashed a hole in the base of the pot. Water leaked out, and his friend was saved.

At the age of 6, Sima heard a lecture concerning the &quot;Zuo Zhuan&quot;, a work of history dating to the 4th century BC. Fascinated, he was able to retell the stories to his family when he returned home. He became an avid reader, &quot;to the point of not recognizing hunger, thirst, coldness or heat&quot;.

Sima obtained early success as a scholar and officer. When he was barely twenty, he passed the Imperial examination with the highest rank of , and spent the next several years in official positions.

===Political ideology===
Sima believed that civilization was created when the sage kings transformed humans from their original animal state using hierarchical order, property rights, moral instruction, and penal law. He believed that the problem with government was not in its structure, but rather in the people that ran it. He wrote multiple memorials detailing how to make the government more effective and argued that his views were in accord with history (in contrast with Wang Anshi&#x27;s emphasis on the Classics) and Heaven-and-Earth. A static and well-maintained country would, according to him, last forever. Accordingly, he disliked commercial growth (which he believed encouraged social change) and preferred a recommendation-based imperial examination system.

Rulers were supposed to only determine official assignments, reward achievement, punish failure, care about their servants, have good morals, and be immune to outside influence. On a wider level, a society with clear inferior-superior roles would be stable. His deeply anti-change perspective made him a political conservative (in contrast with Wang Anshi&#x27;s reformism). For Sima, to be ethical was to accept one&#x27;s social status, and personal cultivation meant exercising restraint; indeed Sima interpreted the &quot;investigation of things&quot;, a fundamental tenet of the Cheng-Zhu school of Neo-confucianism, as &quot;restraining things&quot;. He also agreed with Xunzi&#x27;s postulation that humans were inherently evil and wrote a work called &quot;Doubting Mencius&quot; that criticized Mencius&#x27; encouraging of the overthrow of hierarchy.

==Under Emperor Renzong==
After the failure of the Qingli Reforms under an unenthusiastic Emperor Renzong, the future reformist Wang Anshi submitted a 10,000-word memorial in 1058 detailing a system of comprehensive reform. Sima Guang did the same thing in 1061, but his proposals were more conservative.

==Under Emperor Yingzong==
In 1064, Sima, then just a policy critic, raised the issue between performing rituals for Zhao Yurang, Emperor Yingzong&#x27;s biological father, and Emperor Renzong. This issue would dominate Yingzong&#x27;s reign and cause political gridlock. Sima himself believed that priority should be given to Renzong since he was the emperor&#x27;s ritual father. Yingzong overruled this belief and, partly due to personal affection for his biological father, gave Zhao Yurang high ritual honors in 1066. In the same year, Sima sponsored Su Zhe for a special decree examination.

==Under Emperor Shenzong==
Emperor Shenzong promoted Sima to chief censor in late 1067. He opposed Shenzong&#x27;s irridentism and favored a defensive stance towards the Uyghurs, Tibetans, Western Xia, and Liao dynasty. Sima hoped that the &quot;barbarians&quot; would commend the Song dynasty&#x27;s good government. Since the end of the Qingli Reforms in 1045 did not end the Song dynasty&#x27;s problems, factions developed around how to solve these issues. Conservatives like Sima Guang advocated for a smaller government budget and gradual reform. As such, Sima opposed the New Policies of Wang Anshi, which increased government authority and spending. Sima argued that more state revenue would mean less money for farmers and that the government was immoral for competing with merchants. Somewhat counterintuitively, he emphasized the unifying role of the emperor more than the reformists; he wanted the emperor to manage the bureaucracy and control officials with rewards and punishments, while the reformists wanted to implement new policies for new problems. In response to Emperor Shenzong of Song appointing him as head of the new Office of Expenditure Reduction, Sima released a scathing report that criticized the oversized bureaucracy, imperial extravagance, and an inefficient army and which called for imperial discussion rather than offering specific solutions. Shenzong quickly dissolved the office but continued to accept Sima&#x27;s counsel. 

By 1070, Sima was part of the Hanlin Academy, the Bureau of Military Affairs, and the Council of State. Frustrated with Wang Anshi&#x27;s dominance over court and despite Shenzong&#x27;s urging for him to stay, Sima retired to Luoyang in 1071, which would become the center of the conservative opposition. This made Wang largely unopposed in government. Sima was disturbed by the New Policy&#x27;s control over the dynasty&#x27;s people and resources. 

Sima had multiple objections to the New Policies. He believed that: 
#The economy was a zero-sum game, so any increase in state revenue naturally meant taking away from the commoners.
#Wealth gaps were beneficial to both the rich and the poor due to the stability that such inequalities provided.
#The economy functioned best with minimal governmental intervention. 
#Money was not distributed evenly across the empire, so peasants would struggle to pay cash fees for the New Policies. 

===Retirement===
Sima retired in Luoyang from 1071 to 1085. While there, he wrote the Zizhi Tongjian and cultivated friendships with Shao Yong, Cheng Yi, and Cheng Hao. Massive famines and droughts fueled resentment towards Wang Anshi and garnered support for Sima, contributing to the conservative restoration of 1085. However, Sima was not restored to power following the unpopular Wang&#x27;s retirement in 1076 since Shenzong took personal control over the New Policies. Cai Que, a semi-reformist leader, blocked Sima&#x27;s re-appointment to power despite the failure of the war against the Western Xia. Cai nonetheless ingratiated him to the influential Sima by appointing Sima&#x27;s disciple, Xing Shu, as a scholar.

==Under Emperor Zhezong==
For 40 years following the death of Shenzong, the reformist and conservative factions alternated control over the Song government. Both factions engaged in &quot;ethical factionalism&quot; as they engaged in ruthless purges against each other. An attempted coup by the reformist faction (including Cai Que, Zhang Dun, Xing Shu, and Cai Jing) intended to dethrone Emperor Zhezong failed and aggravated the conservative faction. Sima was an old and tired man in Luoyang and was reluctant to return to the capital, but Cheng Hao convinced him to do so. When Sima arrived in Kaifeng, a large crowd swarmed to touch his horse, and palace guardsmen saluted him as &quot;Prime Minister Sima&quot;. He encouraged people to openly express their grievances about the New Policies.

Sima was soon made chief councilor by Empress Dowager Gao, the regent for Emperor Zhezong and herself a staunch conservative. He and other recalled conservatives like Su Shi, Su Che, Cheng Yi, Cheng Hao, Wang Yansou, Fan Chunren, Wen Yanbo, and Lü Gongzhu formed the Yuanyou faction, named after the current era. Sima made ad hominem denunciations against Wang Anshi, saying: &quot;[Wang] was self-satisfied and self-righteous, and considered himself to be unparalleled by figures past and present.&quot; Sima also blamed the Song dynasty&#x27;s defeat at Yongle City during the war with the Western Xia on poor, glory-oriented leadership, while presenting himself as the &quot;savior of the dynasty&quot;. As the conservative leader, he headed his coalition to demote reformist leaders to lowly prefectural-level posts (while promoting conservatives into high positions and, one by one, abolished many of the New Policies. He also wanted to combine the Secretariat and the Chancellery, arguing that the latter was redundant: &quot;[The Chancellery] serves no purpose except to double the number of clerks and multiply paperwork.&quot; The two departments would be combined in 1129. Cai Que and Zhang Dun would lead the reformist opposition against the conservative restoration.
===Abolishing the Baojia system===
The compulsory Baojia village defense system trained and enrolled nearly 7 million men across the dynasty. Sima criticized the system&#x27;s detracting from agricultural productivity and its potential for creating bandits. Wang Yansou criticized the unnecessary brutality of the system. In mid-1085, an imperial edict abolished the system in the capital and its surrounding areas, with more restrictions imposed on this system in the following months. Reformist opposition to the system&#x27;s abolition was weak and primarily logistical rather than ideological. Zhang Dun&#x27;s call for moderate abolition was reasonable considering the shock that followed the rapid abolishment of the Baojia system.

===Abolishing the equal tax law and market exchange law===
The equal tax law was a system of land evaluation and taxation that was probably the most successful of the New Policies. The law was removed with little opposition in late 1085. 

The market exchange law established government monopolies that were intended to buy cheap products and sell dear products. However, the established agencies cornered the market in staple goods and became focused on generating revenue. Throughout 1085, executive orders forgave debt owed to the agencies and abolished loan bureaus before abolishing the law altogether. This signaled the turning point for the reformist-conservative conflict.

===Abolishing the labor recruitment law and the fall of Cai Que and Zhang Dun===
The labor recruitment law replaced corvée labor with professional laborers funded by service exemption fees paid by the richest rural households. Similar to the market exchange law, this law primarily became a method for revenue extraction. Sima argued that the law was simply another tax imposed on the commoners. Cai Que&#x27;s refusal to remove the labor recruitment law led to his character assassination by the conservatives Liu Chi and Su Che; this pushed him to resign as chancellor of the right and he was reappointed as the administrator of Chenzhou. Zhang Dun continued to resist and pointed out Sima&#x27;s hypocrisy regarding the law: in early 1086, Sima said that rich households were harmed by the law, while just 14 days later he said that rich households benefitted from their preferential treatment under the law. Zhang also criticized Sima&#x27;s demand to abolish the law country-wide in a mere 5 days. Indeed, Sima was impressed when Cai Jing, the mayor of Kaifeng, was the only one who abolished the law in under 5 days. 21 days after Cai Que resigned, Zhang Dun was demoted to a prefectural-level post after offending Empress Gao during a debate. In spring 1086, Wang Anshi died. The conservative restoration was complete.

Nonetheless, the debate over how to remove the labor recruitment law revealed cracks in the conservative coalition. For example, Su Che (and many other conservatives who were typically closely aligned with Sima) argued that &quot;an entire system could not be abolished overnight without serious repercussions&quot; and that a framework for the replacement system should be formulated first. Su Shi, Su Che&#x27;s older brother, formed a third faction and proposed that the funds from the labor recruitment law should be used to buy up public lands to grant to volunteer laborers in addition to their wages. Sima did not accept dissent from either group.

===Abolishing the green sprouts law and peace with the Western Xia===
The green sprouts law was intended to give low-interest loans to farmers but, like many of the aforementioned policies, became a method of revenue extraction. Conservative opposition to this policy was unified and Fan Chunren, the son of Fan Zhongyan, was the only dissenter. His argument that the law could boost the dynasty&#x27;s base revenue annoyed Sima Guang and he was only saved by Wang Yansou&#x27;s intervention. This incident revealed the deepening divisions within Sima&#x27;s coalition that would exacerbate after his death.

Following the protracted, expensive, and ultimately disappointing war against the Western Xia, the conservatives wanted to appease the Western Xia for peace. The concession of Lanzhou to the Xia was highly controversial and, along with 4 fortresses that were ostensibly ceded to Xia, remained a source of border tension for the following decades. The official truce was signed in 1089 and was broken by a 1096 invasion by the restored Zhang Dun.

==Historical work==
Sima Guang is best remembered for his masterwork, &quot;Zizhi Tongjian&quot;, and the Australian sinologist Rafe de Crespigny describes him as &quot;perhaps the greatest of all Chinese historians&quot; .

In 1064, Sima presented to Emperor Yingzong of Song the five-volume (&quot;Chart of Successive Years&quot;). It chronologically summarized events in Chinese history from 403 BCE to 959 CE and served as a prospectus for sponsorship of his ambitious project in historiography. These dates were chosen because 403 BCE was the beginning of the Warring States period, when the ancient State of Jin was subdivided, which eventually led to the establishment of the Qin dynasty—959 CE was the end of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period and the beginning of the Song dynasty.
In 1066, he presented a more detailed eight-volume , which chronicled Chinese history from 403 BCE to 207 BCE (the end of the Qin dynasty). The emperor issued an edict for the compilation of a groundbreaking universal history of China, granting full access to imperial libraries, and allocating funds for the costs of compilation, including research assistance by experienced historians such as Liu Ban (劉攽, 1022–88), Liu Shu (劉恕, 1032–78), and Fan Zuyu (范祖禹, 1041–98). After Yingzong died in 1067, Sima was invited to the palace to introduce his work-in-progress to Emperor Shenzong of Song. The new emperor not only confirmed the interest his father had shown, but showed his favor by bestowing an imperial preface in which he changed the title from &quot;Tongzhi&quot; (&quot;Comprehensive Records&quot;) to &quot;Zizhi Tongjian&quot; (&quot;Comprehensive Mirror to Aid in Government&quot;). Scholars interpret the &quot;Mirror&quot; of the title to denote a work of reference and guidance, indicating that Shenzong accepted Sima as his guide in the study of history and its application to government. The emperor maintained his support for the compilation of this comprehensive history until its completion in 1084.

From the late 1060s, Sima came to assume a role as leader of what has been identified as a conservative faction at court, resolutely opposed to the New Policies of Chancellor Wang Anshi. Sima presented increasingly critical memorials to the throne until 1070, when he refused further appointment and withdrew from court. In 1071, he took up residence in Luoyang, where he remained with an official sinecure, providing sufficient time and resources to continue the compilation of Zizhi Tongjian. Though the historian and the emperor continued to disagree on policies, Sima&#x27;s enforced retirement proved essential for him to complete his chronological history over the following one and a half decades. Contemporary accounts relate that, in order to work more and sleep less when he was writing his great opus, the Zizhi Tongjian, he had a wooden pillow made from a log that was designed to slip from under his head whenever he rolled over. He called this Jingzhen 警枕 (Alert Pillow), and used it throughout the period of Zizhi Tongjian&#x27;s compilation.

===Historiography===
Sima rejected the roles of the dynastic cycle and Five Phases in legitimizing dynastic succession. For Sima, dynastic succession was instead a result of power struggles; dynasties rose and fell according to consistent factors. He believed that history was a &quot;mirror&quot; for the present and could provide the government with historical context for their current situation. Literati could thus use history as an aid to governance. His histories are structured in a way that promotes these theories. 

Sima and the other Yuanyou faction conservatives (except for Su Shi, who had an unorthodox interpretation of the Tao) would be positively associated with Neo-confucianism. Liu Anshi, an important Neoconfucian, was Sima&#x27;s disciple.

==Death==
Emperor Shenzong died in 1085, shortly after Sima had submitted &quot;Zizhi Tongjian&quot; to the throne. Sima was recalled to court and appointed to lead the government under Emperor Zhezong of Song. He used this time in power to repeal many of the New Policies, but he died the following year, in 1086. His death fractured the conservative coalition, which split into the Shuo (Hebei) faction, the Luo (Henan) faction, and the Shu (Sichuan) faction. This ushered in a period of political gridlock from 1086 to 1093.

==Achievements==
As well as his achievements as a statesman and historian, Sima Guang was also a lexicographer (who perhaps edited the &quot;Jiyun&quot;), and spent decades compiling his 1066 &quot;Leipian&quot; (&quot;Classified Chapters&quot;, cf. the Yupian) dictionary. It was based on the &quot;Shuowen Jiezi&quot;, and included 31,319 Chinese characters, many of which were coined in the Song and Tang dynasty. His &quot;Family Precepts of Sima Guang&quot; (司馬溫公家訓) is also widely known and studied in China and Japan.

<text>In computational complexity theory, randomized polynomial time (RP) is the complexity class of problems for which a probabilistic Turing machine exists with these properties:
* It always runs in polynomial time in the input size
* If the correct answer is NO, it always returns NO
* If the correct answer is YES, then it returns YES with probability at least 1/2 (otherwise, it returns NO).

In other words, the algorithm is allowed to flip a truly random coin while it is running. The only case in which the algorithm can return YES is if the actual answer is YES; therefore if the algorithm terminates and produces YES, then the correct answer is definitely YES; however, the algorithm can terminate with NO &quot;regardless&quot; of the actual answer. That is, if the algorithm returns NO, it might be wrong. 

Some authors call this class R, although this name is more commonly used for the class of recursive languages.

If the correct answer is YES and the algorithm is run &quot;n&quot; times with the result of each run statistically independent of the others, then it will return YES at least once with probability at least . So if the algorithm is run 100 times, then the chance of it giving the wrong answer every time is lower than the chance that cosmic rays corrupted the memory of the computer running the algorithm. In this sense, if a source of random numbers is available, most algorithms in RP are highly practical.

The fraction 1/2 in the definition is arbitrary. The set RP will contain exactly the same problems, even if the 1/2 is replaced by any constant nonzero probability less than 1; here constant means independent of the input to the algorithm.

== Formal definition ==
A language &quot;L&quot; is in RP if and only if there exists a probabilistic Turing machine &quot;M&quot;, such that
* &quot;M&quot; runs for polynomial time on all inputs
* For all &quot;x&quot; in &quot;L&quot;, &quot;M&quot; outputs 1 with probability greater than or equal to 1/2
* For all &quot;x&quot; not in &quot;L&quot;, &quot;M&quot; outputs 0

Alternatively, RP can be defined using only deterministic Turing machines. A language &quot;L&quot; is in RP if and only if there exists a polynomial &quot;p&quot; and deterministic Turing machine &quot;M&quot;, such that
* &quot;M&quot; runs for polynomial time p on all inputs
* For all &quot;x&quot; in &quot;L&quot;, the fraction of strings &quot;y&quot; of length &quot;p&quot;(|&quot;x&quot;|) which satisfy is greater than or equal to 1/2
* For all &quot;x&quot; not in &quot;L&quot;, and all strings &quot;y&quot; of length &quot;p&quot;(|&quot;x&quot;|), 
In this definition, the string &quot;y&quot; corresponds to the output of the random coin flips that the probabilistic Turing machine would have made. For some applications this definition is preferable since it does not mention probabilistic Turing machines.

== Related complexity classes ==

The definition of RP says that a YES-answer is always right and that a NO-answer might be wrong, as a YES-instance can return a NO-answer. The complexity class co-RP is the complement, where a YES-answer might be wrong while a NO-answer is always right.

The class BPP describes algorithms that can give incorrect answers on both YES and NO instances, and thus contains both RP and co-RP. The intersection of the sets RP and co-RP is called ZPP. Just as RP may be called R, some authors use the name co-R rather than co-RP.

== Connection to P and NP ==

P is a subset of RP, which is a subset of NP. Similarly, P is a subset of co-RP which is a subset of co-NP. It is not known whether these inclusions are strict. However, if the commonly believed conjecture P = BPP is true, then RP, co-RP, and P collapse (are all equal). Assuming in addition that P ≠ NP, this then implies that RP is strictly contained in NP. It is not known whether RP = co-RP, or whether RP is a subset of the intersection of NP and co-NP, though this would be implied by P = BPP.

A natural example of a problem in co-RP currently not known to be in P is Polynomial Identity Testing, the problem of deciding whether a given multivariate arithmetic expression over the integers is the zero-polynomial. For instance, is the zero-polynomial while
 is not.

An alternative characterization of RP that is sometimes easier to use is the set of problems recognizable by nondeterministic Turing machines where the machine accepts if and only if at least some constant fraction of the computation paths, independent of the input size, accept. NP on the other hand, needs only one accepting path, which could constitute an exponentially small fraction of the paths. This characterization makes the fact that RP is a subset of NP obvious.

<text>In complexity theory, ZPP (zero-error probabilistic polynomial time) is the complexity class of problems for which a probabilistic Turing machine exists with these properties:

* It always returns the correct YES or NO answer.
* The running time is polynomial in expectation for every input.

In other words, if the algorithm is allowed to flip a truly-random coin while it is running, it will always return the correct answer and, for a problem of size &quot;n&quot;, there is some polynomial &quot;p&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) such that the average running time will be less than &quot;p&quot;(&quot;n&quot;), even though it might occasionally be much longer. Such an algorithm is called a Las Vegas algorithm.

Alternatively, ZPP can be defined as the class of problems for which a probabilistic Turing machine exists with these properties:
* It always runs in polynomial time.
* It returns an answer YES, NO or DO NOT KNOW.
* The answer is always either DO NOT KNOW or the correct answer.
* It returns DO NOT KNOW with probability at most 1/2 for every input (and the correct answer otherwise).
The two definitions are equivalent.

The definition of ZPP is based on probabilistic Turing machines, but, for clarity, note that other complexity classes based on them include [[Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial|BPP]] and [[RP (complexity)|RP]]. The class [[BQP]] is based on another machine with randomness: the quantum computer.

== Intersection definition ==
The class ZPP is exactly equal to the intersection of the classes RP and co-RP. This is often taken to be the definition of ZPP. To show this, first note that every problem which is in &quot;both&quot; RP and co-RP has a Las Vegas algorithm as follows:

* Suppose we have a language L recognized by both the RP algorithm A and the (possibly completely different) co-RP algorithm B.
* Given an input, run A on the input for one step. If it returns YES, the answer must be YES. Otherwise, run B on the input for one step. If it returns NO, the answer must be NO. If neither occurs, repeat this step.

Note that only one machine can ever give a wrong answer, and the chance of that machine giving the wrong answer during each repetition is at most 50%. This means that the chance of reaching the &quot;k&quot;th round shrinks exponentially in &quot;k&quot;, showing that the expected running time is polynomial. This shows that RP intersect co-RP is contained in ZPP.

To show that ZPP is contained in RP intersect co-RP, suppose we have a Las Vegas algorithm C to solve a problem. We can then construct the following RP algorithm:
* Run C for at least &quot;double&quot; its expected running time. If it gives an answer, give that answer. If it doesn&#x27;t give any answer before we stop it, give NO.
By Markov&#x27;s Inequality, the chance that it will yield an answer before we stop it is at least 1/2. This means the chance we&#x27;ll give the wrong answer on a YES instance, by stopping and yielding NO, is at most 1/2, fitting the definition of an RP algorithm. The co-RP algorithm is identical, except that it gives YES if C &quot;times out&quot;.

== Witness and proof ==
The classes NP, RP and ZPP can be thought of in terms of proof of membership in a set.

Definition: A &quot;verifier&quot; V for a set X is a Turing machine such that:
* if &quot;x&quot; is in &quot;X&quot; then there exists a string &quot;w&quot; such that &quot;V&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;w&quot;) accepts;
* if &quot;x&quot; is not in &quot;X&quot;, then for all strings &quot;w&quot;, &quot;V&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;w&quot;) rejects.

The string &quot;w&quot; can be thought of as the proof of membership. In the case of short proofs (of length bounded by a polynomial in the size of the input) which can be efficiently verified (&quot;V&quot; is a polynomial-time deterministic Turing machine), the string &quot;w&quot; is called a &quot;witness&quot;. 

Notes:
* The definition is very asymmetric. The proof of x being in X is a single string. The proof of x not being in X is the collection of all strings, none of which is a proof of membership. 
* For all x in X there must be a witness to its membership in X. 
* The witness need not be a traditionally construed proof. If V is a probabilistic Turing machine which could possibly accept x if x is in X, then the proof is the string of coin flips which leads the machine to accept &quot;x&quot; (provided all members in X have some witness and the machine never accepts a non-member).
* The co-concept is a proof of non-membership, or membership in the complement set.

The classes NP, RP and ZPP are sets which have witnesses for membership. The class NP requires only that witnesses exist. They may be very rare. Of the 2&quot;f&quot;(|&quot;x&quot;|) possible strings, with &quot;f&quot; a polynomial, only one need cause the verifier to accept (if x is in X. If x is not in X, no string will cause the verifier to accept). 

For the classes RP and ZPP any string chosen at random will likely be a witness.

The corresponding co-classes have witness for non-membership. In particular, co-RP is the class of sets for which, if x is not in X, any randomly chosen string is likely to be a witness for non-membership. ZPP is the class of sets for which any random string is likely to be a witness of x in X, or x not in X, which ever the case may be.

Connecting this definition with other definitions of RP, co-RP and ZPP is easy. The probabilistic polynomial-time Turing Machine &quot;V*w&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) corresponds to the deterministic polynomial-time Turing Machine &quot;V&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;w&quot;) by replacing the random tape of &quot;V*&quot; with a second input tape for V on which is written the sequence of coin flips. By selecting the witness as a random string, the verifier is a probabilistic polynomial-time Turing Machine whose probability of accepting x when x is in &quot;X&quot; is large (greater than 1/2, say), but zero if &quot;x&quot; ∉ &quot;X&quot; (for RP); of rejecting x when x is not in X is large but zero if &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;X&quot; (for co-RP); and of correctly accepting or rejecting &quot;x&quot; as a member of &quot;X&quot; is large, but zero of incorrectly accepting or rejecting x (for ZPP).

By repeated random selection of a possible witness, the large probability that a random string is a witness gives an expected polynomial time algorithm for accepting or rejecting an input. Conversely, if the Turing Machine is expected polynomial-time (for any given x), then a considerable fraction of the runs must be polynomial-time bounded, and the coin sequence used in such a run will be a witness.

ZPP should be contrasted with BPP. The class BPP does not require witnesses, although witnesses are sufficient (hence BPP contains RP, co-RP and ZPP). A BPP language has V(x,w) accept on a (clear) majority of strings w if x is in X, and conversely reject on a (clear) majority of strings w if x is not in &quot;X&quot;. No single string w need be definitive, and therefore they cannot in general be considered proofs or witnesses.

== Complexity-theoretic properties ==
It is known that ZPP is closed under complement; that is, ZPP = co-ZPP. 

ZPP is low for itself, meaning that a ZPP machine with the power to solve ZPP problems instantly (a ZPP oracle machine) is not any more powerful than the machine without this extra power. In symbols, ZPPZPP = ZPP.

ZPPNPBPP = ZPPNP.

NPBPP is contained in ZPPNP.

== Connection to other classes ==
Since ZPP = RP ∩ coRP, ZPP is obviously contained in both RP and coRP.

The class P is contained in ZPP, and some computer scientists have conjectured that P = ZPP, i.e., every Las Vegas algorithm has a deterministic polynomial-time equivalent.

There exists an oracle relative to which ZPP = EXPTIME. A proof for ZPP = EXPTIME would imply that P ≠ ZPP, as P ≠ EXPTIME (see time hierarchy theorem).

<doc id="54773" wikidata="Q196" url="?curid=54773" title="Cherry">
<text>A cherry is the fruit of many plants of the genus &quot;Prunus&quot;, and is a fleshy drupe (stone fruit).

Commercial cherries are obtained from cultivars of several species, such as the sweet &quot;Prunus avium&quot; and the sour &quot;Prunus cerasus&quot;. The name &#x27;cherry&#x27; also refers to the cherry tree and its wood, and is sometimes applied to almonds and visually similar flowering trees in the genus &quot;Prunus&quot;, as in &quot;ornamental cherry&quot; or &quot;cherry blossom&quot;. Wild cherry may refer to any of the cherry species growing outside cultivation, although &quot;Prunus avium&quot; is often referred to specifically by the name &quot;wild cherry&quot; in the British Isles.

== Botany ==
=== True cherries ===

&quot;Prunus&quot; subg. &quot;Cerasus&quot; contains species that are typically called cherries. They are known as true cherries and distinguished by having a single winter bud per axil, by having the flowers in small corymbs or umbels of several together (occasionally solitary, e.g. &quot;P. serrula&quot;; some species with short racemes, e.g. &quot;P. maacki&quot;), and by having smooth fruit with no obvious groove. Examples of true cherries are:

=== Bush cherries ===
Bush cherries are characterized by having three winter buds per axil. They used to be included in &quot;Prunus&quot; subg. &quot;Cerasus&quot;, but phylogenetic research indicates they should be a section of &quot;Prunus&quot; subg. &quot;Prunus&quot;. Examples of bush cherries are:
* &quot;Prunus cistena&quot; Koehne – purple-leaf sand cherry
* &quot;Prunus humilis&quot; Bunge – Chinese plum-cherry or humble bush cherry
* &quot;Prunus japonica&quot; Thunb. – Korean cherry
* &quot;Prunus prostrata&quot; Labill. – mountain cherry, rock cherry, spreading cherry or prostrate cherry
* &quot;Prunus pumila&quot; L. – sand cherry
* &quot;Prunus tomentosa&quot; Thunb. – Nanking cherry, Manchu cherry, downy cherry, Shanghai cherry, Ando cherry, mountain cherry, Chinese dwarf cherry, Chinese bush cherry

=== Bird cherries, cherry laurels, and other racemose cherries ===

== Etymology ==
The English word cherry derives from Old Northern French or Norman &quot;cherise&quot; from the Latin &quot;cerasum&quot;, referring to an ancient Greek region, Kerasous (Κερασοῦς) near Giresun, Turkey, from which cherries were first thought to be exported to Europe.

The word &quot;cherry&quot; is also used for some species that bear fruits with similar size and shape even though they are not in the same &quot;Prunus&quot; genus; some of these species include the &quot;Jamaican cherry&quot; (&quot;Muntingia calabura&quot;) and the &quot;Spanish cherry&quot; (&quot;Mimusops elengi&quot;).

== Antiquity ==
The indigenous range of the sweet cherry extends through most of Europe, western Asia, and parts of northern Africa, and the fruit has been consumed throughout its range since prehistoric times. A cultivated cherry is recorded as having been brought to Rome by Lucius Licinius Lucullus from northeastern Anatolia, also known as the Pontus region, in 72 BCE.

Cherries were introduced into England at Teynham, near Sittingbourne in Kent, by order of Henry VIII, who had tasted them in Flanders.

Cherries, along with many other fruiting trees and plants, probably first arrived in North America around 1606 in the New France colony of Port Royal, which is modern-day Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia. Richard Guthrie described in 1629, the &quot;fruitful valley adorned with...great variety of fruit trees, chestnuts, pears, apples, cherries, plums and all other fruits.&quot;

== Cultivation ==

The cultivated forms are of the species sweet cherry (&quot;P. avium&quot;) to which most cherry cultivars belong, and the sour cherry (&quot;P. cerasus&quot;), which is used mainly for cooking. Both species originate in Europe and western Asia; they usually do not cross-pollinate. Some other species, although having edible fruit, are not grown extensively for consumption, except in northern regions where the two main species will not grow. Irrigation, spraying, labor, and their propensity to damage from rain and hail make cherries relatively expensive. Nonetheless, demand is high for the fruit. In commercial production, sour cherries, as well as sweet cherries sometimes, are harvested by using a mechanized &quot;shaker.&quot; Hand picking is also widely used for sweet as well as sour cherries to harvest the fruit to avoid damage to both fruit and trees.

Common rootstocks include Mazzard, Mahaleb, Colt, and Gisela Series, a dwarfing rootstock that produces trees significantly smaller than others, only 8 to 10 feet (2.5 to 3 meters) tall. Sour cherries require no pollenizer, while few sweet varieties are self-fertile.

A cherry tree will take three to four years once it is planted in the orchard to produce its first crop of fruit, and seven years to attain full maturity.

=== Growing season ===
Like most temperate-latitude trees, cherry trees require a certain number of chilling hours each year to break dormancy and bloom and produce fruit. The number of chilling hours required depends on the variety. Because of this cold-weather requirement, no members of the genus &quot;Prunus&quot; can grow in tropical climates. (See &quot;production&quot; section for more information on chilling requirements)

Cherries have a short growing season and can grow in most temperate latitudes. Cherries blossom in April (in the Northern Hemisphere) and the peak season for the cherry harvest is in the summer. In southern Europe in June, in North America in June, in England in mid-July, and in southern British Columbia (Canada) in June to mid-August. In many parts of North America, they are among the first tree fruits to flower and ripen in mid-Spring.

In the Southern Hemisphere, cherries are usually at their peak in late December and are widely associated with Christmas. &#x27;Burlat&#x27; is an early variety which ripens during the beginning of December, &#x27;Lapins&#x27; ripens near the end of December, and &#x27;Sweetheart&#x27; finish slightly later.

=== Pests and diseases ===
Generally, the cherry can be a difficult fruit tree to grow and keep alive. In Europe, the first visible pest in the growing season soon after blossom (in April in western Europe) usually is the black cherry aphid (&quot;cherry blackfly,&quot; &quot;Myzus cerasi&quot;), which causes leaves at the tips of branches to curl, with the blackfly colonies exuding a sticky secretion which promotes fungal growth on the leaves and fruit. At the fruiting stage in June/July (Europe), the cherry fruit fly (&quot;Rhagoletis cingulata&quot; and &quot;Rhagoletis cerasi&quot;) lays its eggs in the immature fruit, whereafter its larvae feed on the cherry flesh and exit through a small hole (about 1 mm diameter), which in turn is the entry point for fungal infection of the cherry fruit after rainfall. In addition, cherry trees are susceptible to bacterial canker, cytospora canker, brown rot of the fruit, root rot from overly wet soil, crown rot, and several viruses.

== Cultivars ==

The following cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit:

See cherry blossom and &quot;Prunus&quot; for ornamental trees.

== Production ==


In 2020, world production of sweet cherries was 2.61 million tonnes, with Turkey producing 28% of this total. Other major producers of sweet cherries were the United States and Chile. World production of sour cherries in 2020 was 1.48 million tonnes, led by Russia, Turkey, Ukraine and Serbia.

=== Middle East ===

Major commercial cherry orchards in West Asia are in Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, and Azerbaijan.

=== Europe ===
Major commercial cherry orchards in Europe are in Turkey, Italy, Spain and other Mediterranean regions, and to a smaller extent in the Baltic States and southern Scandinavia.

In France since the 1920s, the first cherries of the season come in April/May from the region of Céret (Pyrénées-Orientales), where the local producers send, as a tradition since 1932, the first crate of cherries to the president of the Republic.

=== North America ===
In the United States, most sweet cherries are grown in Washington, California, Oregon, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Important sweet cherry cultivars include Bing, Ulster, Rainier, Brooks, Tulare, King, and Sweetheart. Both Oregon and Michigan provide light-colored &#x27;Royal Ann&#x27; (&#x27;Napoleon&#x27;; alternately &#x27;Queen Anne&#x27;) cherries for the maraschino cherry process. Most sour (also called tart) cherries are grown in Michigan, followed by Utah, New York, and Washington. Sour cherries include &#x27;Nanking&#x27; and &#x27;Evans.&#x27; Traverse City, Michigan is called the &quot;Cherry Capital of the World&quot;, hosting a National Cherry Festival and making the world&#x27;s largest cherry pie. The specific region of northern Michigan known for tart cherry production is referred to as the &quot;Traverse Bay&quot; region.

Most cherry varieties have a chilling requirement of 800 or more hours, meaning that in order to break dormancy, blossom, and set fruit, the winter season needs to have at least 800 hours where the temperature is below . &quot;Low chill&quot; varieties requiring 300 hours or less are Minnie Royal and Royal Lee, requiring cross-pollinization, whereas the cultivar, Royal Crimson, is self-fertile. These varieties extend the range of cultivation of cherries to the mild winter areas of southern US. This is a boon to California producers of sweet cherries, as California is the second largest producer of sweet cherries in the US.

Native and non-native sweet cherries grow well in Canada&#x27;s provinces of Ontario and British Columbia where an annual cherry festival has been celebrated for seven consecutive decades in the Okanagan Valley town of Osoyoos. In addition to the Okanagan, other British Columbia cherry growing regions are the Similkameen Valley and Kootenay Valley, all three regions together producing 5.5 million kg annually or 60% of total Canadian output. Sweet cherry varieties in British Columbia include &#x27;Rainier&#x27;, &#x27;Van&#x27;, &#x27;Chelan&#x27;, &#x27;Lapins&#x27;, &#x27;Sweetheart&#x27;, &#x27;Skeena&#x27;, &#x27;Staccato&#x27;, &#x27;Christalina&#x27; and &#x27;Bing.&#x27;

=== Australia ===
In Australia, cherries are grown in all the states except for the Northern Territory. The major producing regions are located in the temperate areas within New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. Western Australia has limited production in the elevated parts in the southwest of the state. Key production areas include Young, Orange and Bathurst in New South Wales, Wandin, the Goulburn and Murray valley areas in Victoria, the Adelaide Hills region in South Australia, and the Huon and Derwent Valleys in Tasmania.

Key commercial varieties in order of seasonality include &#x27;Empress&#x27;, &#x27;Merchant&#x27;, &#x27;Supreme&#x27;, &#x27;Ron&#x27;s seedling&#x27;, &#x27;Chelan&#x27;, &#x27;Ulster&#x27;, &#x27;Van&#x27;, &#x27;Bing&#x27;, &#x27;Stella&#x27;, &#x27;Nordwunder&#x27;, &#x27;Lapins&#x27;, &#x27;Simone&#x27;, &#x27;Regina&#x27;, &#x27;Kordia&#x27; and &#x27;Sweetheart&#x27;. New varieties are being introduced, including the late season &#x27;Staccato&#x27; and early season &#x27;Sequoia&#x27;. The Australian Cherry Breeding program is developing a series of new varieties which are under testing evaluation.

The New South Wales town of Young is called the &quot;Cherry Capital of Australia&quot; and hosts the National Cherry Festival.

== Nutritional value ==

Raw sweet cherries are 82% water, 16% carbohydrates, 1% protein, and negligible in fat (table). As raw fruit, sweet cherries provide little nutrient content per 100 g serving, as only dietary fiber and vitamin C are present in moderate content, while other vitamins and dietary minerals each supply less than 10% of the Daily Value (DV) per serving, respectively (table).

Compared to sweet cherries, raw sour cherries contain 50% more vitamin C per 100 g (12% DV) and about 20 times more vitamin A (8% DV), beta-Carotene in particular (table).


&#x27;

=== Health risks ===
The cherry kernels, accessible by chewing or breaking the hard-shelled cherry pits, contain amygdalin, a chemical that releases the toxic compound hydrogen cyanide when ingested. The amount of amygdalin in each cherry varies widely, and symptoms would show only after eating several crushed pits (3–4 of the Morello variety or 7–9 of the red or black varieties). Swallowing the pits whole normally causes no complications.

== Other uses ==

Cherry wood is valued for its rich color and straight grain in manufacturing fine furniture, particularly desks, tables and chairs.

An army of Central Asian vassals of Han, under Cheng Mian, captures the king of the vassal state of Jushi, who is suspected of treachery. The Xiongnu General-in-Chief and the former Han general Li Ling fight indecisively against Shang&#x27;s army.
* Li Guangli and his in-law Prime Minister Liu Qumao seek to recommend Liu Bo, Li Guangli&#x27;s nephew, as the new Crown Prince, and while Li Guangli is on campaign, Liu Qumao and his wife are executed and Li Guangli&#x27;s wife imprisoned, having been charged with cursing the emperor and seeking to replace him with Liu Bo.

A detachment crosses the river and defeats an army of 20,000 under the Xiongnu Left General-in-Chief, who is killed. However, Li Guangli is then defeated by Hulugu Chanyu&#x27;s army of 50,000 in the Khangai Mountains and surrenders. Li Guangli marries Hulugu&#x27;s daughter, and Emperor Wu exterminates Li&#x27;s clan.

<text>Year 88 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Sulla and Rufus (or, less frequently, year 666 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;) and the First Year of Houyuan. The denomination 88 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Roman Republic ====
* The Social War ends with the defeat of the Italian allies by the Romans.
* August: The consul Lucius Cornelius Sulla becomes the first Roman commander to march on Rome with his army and to capture the city by force. This extraordinary act is prompted by his desire to maintain his proconsular command for the First Mithridatic War in Asia Minor. Sulla then murdered his enemy P. Sulpicius Rufus and forced Gaius Marius to flee to Africa.
* The Dardani, Scordisci, and the Maedi attack the Roman province of Macedonia.

==== Greece ====
* May – King Mithridates VI of Pontus invades Greece. Defeating the Roman forces four times in succession, he conquers Bithynia, Phrygia, Mysia, Lycia, Pamphylia, Ionia and Cappadocia. The Roman province of Asia is dismantled. On the king&#x27;s orders, the local authorities in every city of the province round up and put to death all resident Italians in a single day (App.&quot;Mith&quot;.§§85–91). Plutarch (Sulla 24.4) says that 150,000 are killed, other sources calculate a figure of 80,000 people.

==== China ====
* Emperor Wu of Han makes preparations for the six-year-old Liu Fuling to be made Crown Prince and establishes Huo Guang as the future regent. The emperor executes Fuling&#x27;s mother Lady Gouyi so that she cannot dominate the state while Fuling is a child emperor.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Births ==

== Deaths ==
* Demetrius III Eucaerus, king of the Seleucid Empire
* Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus, Roman consul 
* Lady Gouyi, mother of Zhao of Han (b. 113)
* Manius Aquillius, Roman consul and general
* Ptolemy X Alexander I, king (pharaoh) of Egypt
* Publius Sulpicius Rufus, Roman tribune of the plebs, murdered by Sulla

<doc id="54783" wikidata="Q193544" url="?curid=54783" title="Music theory">
<text>Music theory is the study of theoretical frameworks for understanding the practices and possibilities of music. &quot;The Oxford Companion to Music&quot; describes three interrelated uses of the term &quot;music theory&quot;: The first is the &quot;rudiments&quot;, that are needed to understand music notation (key signatures, time signatures, and rhythmic notation); the second is learning scholars&#x27; views on music from antiquity to the present; the third is a sub-topic of musicology that &quot;seeks to define processes and general principles in music&quot;. The musicological approach to theory differs from music analysis &quot;in that it takes as its starting-point not the individual work or performance but the fundamental materials from which it is built.&quot;

Music theory is frequently concerned with describing how musicians and composers make music, including tuning systems and composition methods among other topics. Because of the ever-expanding conception of what constitutes music, a more inclusive definition could be the consideration of any sonic phenomena, including silence. This is not an absolute guideline, however; for example, the study of &quot;music&quot; in the &quot;Quadrivium&quot; liberal arts university curriculum, that was common in medieval Europe, was an abstract system of proportions that was carefully studied at a distance from actual musical practice. But this medieval discipline became the basis for tuning systems in later centuries and is generally included in modern scholarship on the history of music theory.

Music theory as a practical discipline encompasses the methods and concepts that composers and other musicians use in creating and performing music. The development, preservation, and transmission of music theory in this sense may be found in oral and written music-making traditions, musical instruments, and other artifacts. For example, ancient instruments from prehistoric sites around the world reveal details about the music they produced and potentially something of the musical theory that might have been used by their makers. In ancient and living cultures around the world, the deep and long roots of music theory are visible in instruments, oral traditions, and current music-making. Many cultures have also considered music theory in more formal ways such as written treatises and music notation. Practical and scholarly traditions overlap, as many practical treatises about music place themselves within a tradition of other treatises, which are cited regularly just as scholarly writing cites earlier research.

In modern academia, music theory is a subfield of musicology, the wider study of musical cultures and history. Guido Adler, however, in one of the texts that founded musicology in the late 19th century, wrote that &quot;the science of music originated at the same time as the art of sounds&quot;, where &quot;the science of music&quot; (&quot;Musikwissenschaft&quot;) obviously meant &quot;music theory&quot;. Adler added that music only could exist when one began measuring pitches and comparing them to each other. He concluded that &quot;all people for which one can speak of an art of sounds also have a science of sounds&quot;. One must deduce that music theory exists in all musical cultures of the world.

Music theory is often concerned with abstract musical aspects such as tuning and tonal systems, scales, consonance and dissonance, and rhythmic relationships. There is also a body of theory concerning practical aspects, such as the creation or the performance of music, orchestration, ornamentation, improvisation, and electronic sound production. A person who researches or teaches music theory is a music theorist. University study, typically to the MA or PhD level, is required to teach as a tenure-track music theorist in a US or Canadian university. Methods of analysis include mathematics, graphic analysis, and especially analysis enabled by western music notation. Comparative, descriptive, statistical, and other methods are also used. Music theory textbooks, especially in the United States of America, often include elements of musical acoustics, considerations of musical notation, and techniques of tonal composition (harmony and counterpoint), among other topics.

==History==
===Antiquity===
====Mesopotamia====
Several surviving Sumerian and Akkadian clay tablets include musical information of a theoretical nature, mainly lists of intervals and tunings. The scholar Sam Mirelman reports that the earliest of these texts dates from before 1500 BCE, a millennium earlier than surviving evidence from any other culture of comparable musical thought. Further, &quot;All the Mesopotamian texts [about music] are united by the use of a terminology for music that, according to the approximate dating of the texts, was in use for over 1,000 years.&quot;

====China====
Much of Chinese music history and theory remains unclear.

Chinese theory starts from numbers, the main musical numbers being twelve, five and eight. Twelve refers to the number of pitches on which the scales can be constructed, Five refers to the Pentatonic Scale (primarily uses a 5-note scale), And Eight refers to the eight categories of Chinese Music Instruments; classified by the material they are made from: (Metal, Stone, Silk, Bamboo, Gourd, Clay, Leather, and Wood). The Lüshi chunqiu from about 238 BCE recalls the legend of Ling Lun. On order of the Yellow Emperor, Ling Lun collected twelve bamboo lengths with thick and even nodes. Blowing on one of these like a pipe, he found its sound agreeable and named it &quot;huangzhong&quot;, the &quot;Yellow Bell.&quot; He then heard phoenixes singing. The male and female phoenix each sang six tones. Ling Lun cut his bamboo pipes to match the pitches of the phoenixes, producing twelve pitch pipes in two sets: six from the male phoenix and six from the female: these were called the &quot;lülü&quot; or later the &quot;shierlü&quot;.

Apart from technical and structural aspects, ancient Chinese music theory also discusses topics such as the nature and functions of music. The &quot;Yueji&quot; (&quot;Record of music&quot;, c1st and 2nd centuries BCE), for example, manifests Confucian moral theories of understanding music in its social context. Studied and implemented by Confucian scholar-officials [...], these theories helped form a musical Confucianism that overshadowed but did not erase rival approaches. These include the assertion of Mozi (c. 468 – c. 376 BCE) that music wasted human and material resources, and Laozi&#x27;s claim that the greatest music had no sounds. [...] Even the music of the &quot;qin&quot; zither, a genre closely affiliated with Confucian scholar-officials, includes many works with Daoist references, such as &quot;Tianfeng huanpei&quot; (&quot;Heavenly Breeze and Sounds of Jade Pendants&quot;).

====India====

The Samaveda and Yajurveda (c. 1200 – 1000 BCE) are among the earliest testimonies of Indian music, but properly speaking, they contain no theory. The Natya Shastra, written between 200 BCE to 200 CE, discusses intervals (&quot;Śrutis&quot;), scales (&quot;Grāmas&quot;), consonances and dissonances, classes of melodic structure (&quot;Mūrchanās&quot;, modes?), melodic types (&quot;Jātis&quot;), instruments, etc.

====Greece====
Early preserved Greek writings on music theory include two types of works:
* technical manuals describing the Greek musical system including notation, scales, consonance and dissonance, rhythm, and types of musical compositions;
* treatises on the way in which music reveals universal patterns of order leading to the highest levels of knowledge and understanding.
Several names of theorists are known before these works, including Pythagoras ( ~ ), Philolaus (), and others.

Works of the first type (technical manuals) include
* 
* 
* 

More philosophical treatises of the second type include
* 
* 

===Post-classical or Medieval Period===
====China====
The pipa instrument carried with it a theory of musical modes that subsequently led to the Sui and Tang theory of 84 musical modes.

====Arabic countries / Persian countries====

Medieval Arabic music theorists include:

* Abū Yūsuf Ya&#x27;qūb al-Kindi (Bagdad, 873 CE), who uses the first twelve letters of the alphabet to describe the twelve frets on five strings of the oud, producing a chromatic scale of 25 degrees.
* [Yaḥyā ibn] al-Munajjim (Baghdad, 856–912), author of &quot;Risāla fī al-mūsīqī&quot; (&quot;Treatise on music&quot;, MS GB-Lbl Oriental 2361) which describes a Pythagorean tuning of the oud and a system of eight modes perhaps inspired by Ishaq al-Mawsili (767–850).
* Abū n-Nașr Muḥammad al-Fārābi (Persia, 872? – Damas, 950 or 951 CE), author of &quot;Kitab al-Musiqa al-Kabir&quot; (&quot;The Great Book of Music&quot;).
* &#x27;Ali ibn al-Husayn ul-Isfahānī (897–967), known as Abu al-Faraj al-Isfahani, author of &quot;Kitāb al-Aghānī&quot; (&quot;The Book of Songs&quot;).
* Abū &#x27;Alī al-Ḥusayn ibn ʿAbd-Allāh ibn Sīnā, known as Avicenna (c. 980 – 1037), whose contribution to music theory consists mainly in Chapter 12 of the section on mathematics of his &quot;Kitab Al-Shifa&quot; (&quot;The Book of Healing&quot;).
* al-Ḥasan ibn Aḥmad ibn &#x27;Ali al-Kātib, author of Kamāl adab al Ghinā&#x27; (&quot;The Perfection of Musical Knowledge&quot;), copied in 1225 (Istanbul, Topkapi Museum, Ms 1727).
* Safi al-Din al-Urmawi (1216–1294 CE), author of the &quot;Kitabu al-Adwār&quot; (&quot;Treatise of musical cycles&quot;) and &quot;ar-Risālah aš-Šarafiyyah&quot; (&quot;Epistle to Šaraf&quot;).
* Mubārak Šāh, commentator of Safi al-Din&#x27;s &quot;Kitāb al-Adwār&quot; (British Museum, Ms 823).
* Anon. LXI, Anonymous commentary on Safi al-Din&#x27;s &quot;Kitāb al-Adwār&quot;.
* Shams al-dῑn al-Saydᾱwῑ Al-Dhahabῑ (14th century CE (?)), music theorist. Author of &quot;Urjῡza fi&#x27;l-mῡsῑqᾱ&quot; (&quot;A Didactic Poem on Music&quot;).

====Europe====
The Latin treatise &quot;De institutione musica&quot; by the Roman philosopher Boethius (written c. 500, translated as &quot;Fundamentals of Music&quot;) was a touchstone for other writings on music in medieval Europe. Boethius represented Classical authority on music during the Middle Ages, as the Greek writings on which he based his work were not read or translated by later Europeans until the 15th century. This treatise carefully maintains distance from the actual practice of music, focusing mostly on the mathematical proportions involved in tuning systems and on the moral character of particular modes. Several centuries later, treatises began to appear which dealt with the actual composition of pieces of music in the plainchant tradition. At the end of the ninth century, Hucbald worked towards more precise pitch notation for the neumes used to record plainchant.

Guido d&#x27;Arezzo wrote a letter to Michael of Pomposa in 1028, entitled &quot;Epistola de ignoto cantu&quot;, in which he introduced the practice of using syllables to describe notes and intervals. This was the source of the hexachordal solmization that was to be used until the end of the Middle Ages. Guido also wrote about emotional qualities of the modes, the phrase structure of plainchant, the temporal meaning of the neumes, etc.; his chapters on polyphony &quot;come closer to describing and illustrating real music than any previous account&quot; in the Western tradition.

During the thirteenth century, a new rhythm system called mensural notation grew out of an earlier, more limited method of notating rhythms in terms of fixed repetitive patterns, the so-called rhythmic modes, which were developed in France around 1200. An early form of mensural notation was first described and codified in the treatise &quot;Ars cantus mensurabilis&quot; (&quot;The art of measured chant&quot;) by Franco of Cologne (c. 1280). Mensural notation used different note shapes to specify different durations, allowing scribes to capture rhythms which varied instead of repeating the same fixed pattern; it is a proportional notation, in the sense that each note value is equal to two or three times the shorter value, or half or a third of the longer value. This same notation, transformed through various extensions and improvements during the Renaissance, forms the basis for rhythmic notation in European classical music today.

===Modern===
====Middle Eastern and Central Asian countries====

* Bāqiyā Nāyinῑ (Uzbekistan, 17th century CE), Uzbek author and music theorist. Author of &quot;Zamzama e wahdat-i-mῡsῑqῑ&quot; [&quot;The Chanting of Unity in Music&quot;].
* Baron Francois Rodolphe d&#x27;Erlanger (Tunis, Tunisia, 1910–1932 CE), French musicologist. Author of &quot;La musique arabe&quot; and &quot;Ta&#x27;rῑkh al-mῡsῑqᾱ al-arabiyya wa-usῡluha wa-tatawwurᾱtuha&quot; [&quot;A History of Arabian Music, its principles and its Development&quot;]

D&#x27;Erlanger divulges that the Arabic music scale is derived from the Greek music scale, and that Arabic music is connected to certain features of Arabic culture, such as astrology.

====Europe====
* Renaissance

* Baroque
* 1750–1900
** As Western musical influence spread throughout the world in the 1800s, musicians adopted Western theory as an international standard—but other theoretical traditions in both textual and oral traditions remain in use. For example, the long and rich musical traditions unique to ancient and current cultures of Africa are primarily oral, but describe specific forms, genres, performance practices, tunings, and other aspects of music theory.
** Sacred harp music uses a different kind of scale and theory in practice. The music focuses on the solfege &quot;fa, sol, la&quot; on the music scale. Sacred Harp also employs a different notation involving &quot;shape notes&quot;, or notes that are shaped to correspond to a certain solfege syllable on the music scale. Sacred Harp music and its music theory originated with Reverend Thomas Symmes in 1720, where he developed a system for &quot;singing by note&quot; to help his church members with note accuracy.

==Fundamentals of music==

Music is composed of aural phenomena; &quot;music theory&quot; considers how those phenomena apply in music. Music theory considers melody, rhythm, counterpoint, harmony, form, tonal systems, scales, tuning, intervals, consonance, dissonance, durational proportions, the acoustics of pitch systems, composition, performance, orchestration, ornamentation, improvisation, electronic sound production, etc.

===Pitch===
Pitch is the lowness or highness of a tone, for example the difference between middle C and a higher C. The frequency of the sound waves producing a pitch can be measured precisely, but the perception of pitch is more complex because single notes from natural sources are usually a complex mix of many frequencies. Accordingly, theorists often describe pitch as a subjective sensation rather than an objective measurement of sound.

Specific frequencies are often assigned letter names. Today most orchestras assign concert A (the A above middle C on the piano) to the frequency of 440 Hz. This assignment is somewhat arbitrary; for example, in 1859 France, the same A was tuned to 435 Hz. Such differences can have a noticeable effect on the timbre of instruments and other phenomena. Thus, in historically informed performance of older music, tuning is often set to match the tuning used in the period when it was written. Additionally, many cultures do not attempt to standardize pitch, often considering that it should be allowed to vary depending on genre, style, mood, etc.

The difference in pitch between two notes is called an interval. The most basic interval is the unison, which is simply two notes of the same pitch. The octave interval is two pitches that are either double or half the frequency of one another. The unique characteristics of octaves gave rise to the concept of pitch class: pitches of the same letter name that occur in different octaves may be grouped into a single &quot;class&quot; by ignoring the difference in octave. For example, a high C and a low C are members of the same pitch class—the class that contains all C&#x27;s.

Musical tuning systems, or temperaments, determine the precise size of intervals. Tuning systems vary widely within and between world cultures. In Western culture, there have long been several competing tuning systems, all with different qualities. Internationally, the system known as equal temperament is most commonly used today because it is considered the most satisfactory compromise that allows instruments of fixed tuning (e.g. the piano) to sound acceptably in tune in all keys.

===Scales and modes===
Notes can be arranged in a variety of scales and modes. Western music theory generally divides the octave into a series of twelve pitches, called a chromatic scale, within which the interval between adjacent tones is called a semitone, or half step. Selecting tones from this set of 12 and arranging them in patterns of semitones and whole tones creates other scales.

The most commonly encountered scales are the seven-toned major, the harmonic minor, the melodic minor, and the natural minor. Other examples of scales are the octatonic scale and the pentatonic or five-tone scale, which is common in folk music and blues. Non-Western cultures often use scales that do not correspond with an equally divided twelve-tone division of the octave. For example, classical Ottoman, Persian, Indian and Arabic musical systems often make use of multiples of quarter tones (half the size of a semitone, as the name indicates), for instance in &#x27;neutral&#x27; seconds (three quarter tones) or &#x27;neutral&#x27; thirds (seven quarter tones)—they do not normally use the quarter tone itself as a direct interval.

In traditional Western notation, the scale used for a composition is usually indicated by a key signature at the beginning to designate the pitches that make up that scale. As the music progresses, the pitches used may change and introduce a different scale. Music can be transposed from one scale to another for various purposes, often to accommodate the range of a vocalist. Such transposition raises or lowers the overall pitch range, but preserves the intervallic relationships of the original scale. For example, transposition from the key of C major to D major raises all pitches of the scale of C major equally by a whole tone. Since the interval relationships remain unchanged, transposition may be unnoticed by a listener, however other qualities may change noticeably because transposition changes the relationship of the overall pitch range compared to the range of the instruments or voices that perform the music. This often affects the music&#x27;s overall sound, as well as having technical implications for the performers.

The interrelationship of the keys most commonly used in Western tonal music is conveniently shown by the circle of fifths. Unique key signatures are also sometimes devised for a particular composition. During the Baroque period, emotional associations with specific keys, known as the doctrine of the affections, were an important topic in music theory, but the unique tonal colorings of keys that gave rise to that doctrine were largely erased with the adoption of equal temperament. However, many musicians continue to feel that certain keys are more appropriate to certain emotions than others. Indian classical music theory continues to strongly associate keys with emotional states, times of day, and other extra-musical concepts and notably, does not employ equal temperament.

===Consonance and dissonance===
Consonance and dissonance are subjective qualities of the sonority of intervals that vary widely in different cultures and over the ages. Consonance (or concord) is the quality of an interval or chord that seems stable and complete in itself. Dissonance (or discord) is the opposite in that it feels incomplete and &quot;wants to&quot; resolve to a consonant interval. Dissonant intervals seem to clash. Consonant intervals seem to sound comfortable together. Commonly, perfect fourths, fifths, and octaves and all major and minor thirds and sixths are considered consonant. All others are dissonant to a greater or lesser degree.

Context and many other aspects can affect apparent dissonance and consonance. For example, in a Debussy prelude, a major second may sound stable and consonant, while the same interval may sound dissonant in a Bach fugue. In the Common practice era, the perfect fourth is considered dissonant when not supported by a lower third or fifth. Since the early 20th century, Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s concept of &quot;emancipated&quot; dissonance, in which traditionally dissonant intervals can be treated as &quot;higher,&quot; more remote consonances, has become more widely accepted.

===Rhythm===
Rhythm is produced by the sequential arrangement of sounds and silences in time. Meter measures music in regular pulse groupings, called measures or bars. The time signature or meter signature specifies how many beats are in a measure, and which value of written note is counted or felt as a single beat.

Through increased stress, or variations in duration or articulation, particular tones may be accented. There are conventions in most musical traditions for regular and hierarchical accentuation of beats to reinforce a given meter. Syncopated rhythms contradict those conventions by accenting unexpected parts of the beat. Playing simultaneous rhythms in more than one time signature is called polyrhythm.

In recent years, rhythm and meter have become an important area of research among music scholars. The most highly cited of these recent scholars are Maury Yeston, Fred Lerdahl and Ray Jackendoff, Jonathan Kramer, and Justin London.

===Melody===
A melody is a group of musical sounds in agreeable succession or arrangement. Because melody is such a prominent aspect in so much music, its construction and other qualities are a primary interest of music theory.

The basic elements of melody are pitch, duration, rhythm, and tempo. The tones of a melody are usually drawn from pitch systems such as scales or modes. Melody may consist, to increasing degree, of the figure, motive, semi-phrase, antecedent and consequent phrase, and period or sentence. The period may be considered the complete melody, however some examples combine two periods, or use other combinations of constituents to create larger form melodies.

===Chord===
A chord, in music, is any harmonic set of three or more notes that is heard as if sounding simultaneously. These need not actually be played together: arpeggios and broken chords may, for many practical and theoretical purposes, constitute chords. Chords and sequences of chords are frequently used in modern Western, West African, and Oceanian music, whereas they are absent from the music of many other parts of the world.

The most frequently encountered chords are triads, so called because they consist of three distinct notes: further notes may be added to give seventh chords, extended chords, or added tone chords. The most common chords are the &quot;major&quot; and &quot;minor triads&quot; and then the &quot;augmented&quot; and &quot;diminished triads&quot;. The descriptions &quot;major&quot;, &quot;minor&quot;, &quot;augmented&quot;, and &quot;diminished&quot; are sometimes referred to collectively as chordal &quot;quality&quot;. Chords are also commonly classed by their root note—so, for instance, the chord C major may be described as a triad of major quality built on the note C. Chords may also be classified by inversion, the order in which the notes are stacked.

A series of chords is called a chord progression. Although any chord may in principle be followed by any other chord, certain patterns of chords have been accepted as establishing key in common-practice harmony. To describe this, chords are numbered, using Roman numerals (upward from the key-note), per their diatonic function. Common ways of notating or representing chords in western music other than conventional staff notation include Roman numerals, figured bass (much used in the Baroque era), chord letters (sometimes used in modern musicology), and various systems of chord charts typically found in the lead sheets used in popular music to lay out the sequence of chords so that the musician may play accompaniment chords or improvise a solo.

===Harmony===
In music, harmony is the use of simultaneous pitches (tones, notes), or chords. The study of harmony involves chords and their construction and chord progressions and the principles of connection that govern them. Harmony is often said to refer to the &quot;vertical&quot; aspect of music, as distinguished from melodic line, or the &quot;horizontal&quot; aspect. Counterpoint, which refers to the interweaving of melodic lines, and polyphony, which refers to the relationship of separate independent voices, is thus sometimes distinguished from harmony.

In popular and jazz harmony, chords are named by their root plus various terms and characters indicating their qualities. For example, a lead sheet may indicate chords such as C major, D minor, and G dominant seventh. In many types of music, notably Baroque, Romantic, modern, and jazz, chords are often augmented with &quot;tensions&quot;. A tension is an additional chord member that creates a relatively dissonant interval in relation to the bass. It is part of a chord, but is not one of the chord tones (1 3 5 7). Typically, in the classical common practice period a dissonant chord (chord with tension) &quot;resolves&quot; to a consonant chord. Harmonization usually sounds pleasant to the ear when there is a balance between the consonant and dissonant sounds. In simple words, that occurs when there is a balance between &quot;tense&quot; and &quot;relaxed&quot; moments.

===Timbre===

Timbre, sometimes called &quot;color&quot;, or &quot;tone color,&quot; is the principal phenomenon that allows us to distinguish one instrument from another when both play at the same pitch and volume, a quality of a voice or instrument often described in terms like bright, dull, shrill, etc. It is of considerable interest in music theory, especially because it is one component of music that has as yet, no standardized nomenclature. It has been called &quot;... the psychoacoustician&#x27;s multidimensional waste-basket category for everything that cannot be labeled pitch or loudness,&quot; but can be accurately described and analyzed by Fourier analysis and other methods because it results from the combination of all sound frequencies, attack and release envelopes, and other qualities that a tone comprises.

Timbre is principally determined by two things: (1) the relative balance of overtones produced by a given instrument due its construction (e.g. shape, material), and (2) the envelope of the sound (including changes in the overtone structure over time). Timbre varies widely between different instruments, voices, and to lesser degree, between instruments of the same type due to variations in their construction, and significantly, the performer&#x27;s technique. The timbre of most instruments can be changed by employing different techniques while playing. For example, the timbre of a trumpet changes when a mute is inserted into the bell, the player changes their embouchure, or volume.

A voice can change its timbre by the way the performer manipulates their vocal apparatus, (e.g. the shape of the vocal cavity or mouth). Musical notation frequently specifies alteration in timbre by changes in sounding technique, volume, accent, and other means. These are indicated variously by symbolic and verbal instruction. For example, the word &quot;dolce&quot; (sweetly) indicates a non-specific, but commonly understood soft and &quot;sweet&quot; timbre. &quot;Sul tasto&quot; instructs a string player to bow near or over the fingerboard to produce a less brilliant sound. &quot;Cuivre&quot; instructs a brass player to produce a forced and stridently brassy sound. Accent symbols like &quot;marcato&quot; (^) and dynamic indications (&quot;pp&quot;) can also indicate changes in timbre.

====Dynamics====

In music, &quot;dynamics&quot; normally refers to variations of intensity or volume, as may be measured by physicists and audio engineers in decibels or phons. In music notation, however, dynamics are not treated as absolute values, but as relative ones. Because they are usually measured subjectively, there are factors besides amplitude that affect the performance or perception of intensity, such as timbre, vibrato, and articulation.

The conventional indications of dynamics are abbreviations for Italian words like &quot;forte&quot; (f) for loud and &quot;piano&quot; (p) for soft. These two basic notations are modified by indications including &quot;mezzo piano&quot; (mp) for moderately soft (literally &quot;half soft&quot;) and &quot;mezzo forte&quot; (mf) for moderately loud, &quot;sforzando&quot; or &quot;sforzato&quot; (sfz) for a surging or &quot;pushed&quot; attack, or &quot;fortepiano&quot; (fp) for a loud attack with a sudden decrease to a soft level. The full span of these markings usually range from a nearly inaudible &quot;pianissississimo&quot; (pppp) to a loud-as-possible &quot;fortissississimo&quot; (ffff).

Greater extremes of pppppp and fffff and nuances such as p+ or &quot;più piano&quot; are sometimes found. Other systems of indicating volume are also used in both notation and analysis: dB (decibels), numerical scales, colored or different sized notes, words in languages other than Italian, and symbols such as those for progressively increasing volume (&quot;crescendo&quot;) or decreasing volume (&quot;diminuendo&quot; or &quot;decrescendo&quot;), often called &quot;hairpins&quot; when indicated with diverging or converging lines as shown in the graphic above.

====Articulation====

Articulation is the way the performer sounds notes. For example, &quot;staccato&quot; is the shortening of duration compared to the written note value, &quot;legato&quot; performs the notes in a smoothly joined sequence with no separation. Articulation is often described rather than quantified, therefore there is room to interpret how to execute precisely each articulation.

For example, &quot;staccato&quot; is often referred to as &quot;separated&quot; or &quot;detached&quot; rather than having a defined or numbered amount by which to reduce the notated duration. Violin players use a variety of techniques to perform different qualities of &quot;staccato.&quot; The manner in which a performer decides to execute a given articulation is usually based on the context of the piece or phrase, but many articulation symbols and verbal instructions depend on the instrument and musical period (e.g. viol, wind; classical, baroque; etc.).

There is a set of articulations that most instruments and voices perform in common. They are—from long to short: &quot;legato&quot; (smooth, connected); &quot;tenuto&quot; (pressed or played to full notated duration); &quot;marcato&quot; (accented and detached); &quot;staccato&quot; (&quot;separated&quot;, &quot;detached&quot;); &quot;martelé&quot; (heavily accented or &quot;hammered&quot;). Many of these can be combined to create certain &quot;in-between&quot; articulations. For example, &quot;portato&quot; is the combination of &quot;tenuto&quot; and &quot;staccato&quot;. Some instruments have unique methods by which to produce sounds, such as &quot;spiccato&quot; for bowed strings, where the bow bounces off the string.

===Texture===
In music, texture is how the melodic, rhythmic, and harmonic materials are combined in a composition, thus determining the overall quality of the sound in a piece. Texture is often described in regard to the density, or thickness, and range, or width, between lowest and highest pitches, in relative terms as well as more specifically distinguished according to the number of voices, or parts, and the relationship between these voices. For example, a thick texture contains many &quot;layers&quot; of instruments. One of these layers could be a string section, or another brass.

The thickness also is affected by the number and the richness of the instruments playing the piece. The thickness varies from light to thick. A lightly textured piece will have light, sparse scoring. A thickly or heavily textured piece will be scored for many instruments. A piece&#x27;s texture may be affected by the number and character of parts playing at once, the timbre of the instruments or voices playing these parts and the harmony, tempo, and rhythms used. The types categorized by number and relationship of parts are analyzed and determined through the labeling of primary textural elements: primary melody, secondary melody, parallel supporting melody, static support, harmonic support, rhythmic support, and harmonic and rhythmic support.

Common types included monophonic texture (a single melodic voice, such as a piece for solo soprano or solo flute), biphonic texture (two melodic voices, such as a duo for bassoon and flute in which the bassoon plays a drone note and the flute plays the melody), polyphonic texture and homophonic texture (chords accompanying a melody).

===Form or structure===
The term musical form (or musical architecture) refers to the overall structure or plan of a piece of music, and it describes the layout of a composition as divided into sections. In the tenth edition of &quot;The Oxford Companion to Music&quot;, Percy Scholes defines musical form as &quot;a series of strategies designed to find a successful mean between the opposite extremes of unrelieved repetition and unrelieved alteration.&quot; According to Richard Middleton, musical form is &quot;the shape or structure of the work.&quot; He describes it through difference: the distance moved from a repeat; the latter being the smallest difference. Difference is quantitative and qualitative: &quot;how far&quot;, and &quot;of what type&quot;, different. In many cases, form depends on statement and restatement, unity and variety, and contrast and connection.

===Expression===
Musical expression is the art of playing or singing music with emotional communication. The elements of music that comprise expression include dynamic indications, such as forte or piano, phrasing, differing qualities of timbre and articulation, color, intensity, energy and excitement. All of these devices can be incorporated by the performer. A performer aims to elicit responses of sympathetic feeling in the audience, and to excite, calm or otherwise sway the audience&#x27;s physical and emotional responses. Musical expression is sometimes thought to be produced by a combination of other parameters, and sometimes described as a transcendent quality that is more than the sum of measurable quantities such as pitch or duration.

Expression on instruments can be closely related to the role of the breath in singing, and the voice&#x27;s natural ability to express feelings, sentiment and deep emotions. Whether these can somehow be categorized is perhaps the realm of academics, who view expression as an element of musical performance that embodies a consistently recognizable emotion, ideally causing a sympathetic emotional response in its listeners. The emotional content of musical expression is distinct from the emotional content of specific sounds (e.g., a startlingly-loud &#x27;bang&#x27;) and of learned associations (e.g., a national anthem), but can rarely be completely separated from its context.

The components of musical expression continue to be the subject of extensive and unresolved dispute.

===Notation===
Musical notation is the written or symbolized representation of music. This is most often achieved by the use of commonly understood graphic symbols and written verbal instructions and their abbreviations. There are many systems of music notation from different cultures and different ages. Traditional Western notation evolved during the Middle Ages and remains an area of experimentation and innovation. In the 2000s, computer file formats have become important as well. Spoken language and hand signs are also used to symbolically represent music, primarily in teaching.

In standard Western music notation, tones are represented graphically by symbols (notes) placed on a staff or staves, the vertical axis corresponding to pitch and the horizontal axis corresponding to time. Note head shapes, stems, flags, ties and dots are used to indicate duration. Additional symbols indicate keys, dynamics, accents, rests, etc. Verbal instructions from the conductor are often used to indicate tempo, technique, and other aspects.

In Western music, a range of different music notation systems are used. In Western Classical music, conductors use printed scores that show all of the instruments&#x27; parts and orchestra members read parts with their musical lines written out. In popular styles of music, much less of the music may be notated. A rock band may go into a recording session with just a handwritten chord chart indicating the song&#x27;s chord progression using chord names (e.g., C major, D minor, G7, etc.). All of the chord voicings, rhythms and accompaniment figures are improvised by the band members.

==As academic discipline==
The scholarly study of music theory in the twentieth century has a number of different subfields, each of which takes a different perspective on what are the primary phenomenon of interest and the most useful methods for investigation.

===Analysis===
Musical analysis is the attempt to answer the question &quot;how does this music work?&quot; The method employed to answer this question, and indeed exactly what is meant by the question, differs from analyst to analyst, and according to the purpose of the analysis. According to Ian Bent, &quot;analysis, as a pursuit in its own right, came to be established only in the late 19th century; its emergence as an approach and method can be traced back to the 1750s. However, it existed as a scholarly tool, albeit an auxiliary one, from the Middle Ages onwards.&quot; Adolf Bernhard Marx was influential in formalising concepts about composition and music understanding towards the second half of the 19th century. The principle of analysis has been variously criticized, especially by composers, such as Edgard Varèse&#x27;s claim that, &quot;to explain by means of [analysis] is to decompose, to mutilate the spirit of a work&quot;.

Schenkerian analysis is a method of musical analysis of tonal music based on the theories of Heinrich Schenker (1868–1935). The goal of a Schenkerian analysis is to interpret the underlying structure of a tonal work and to help reading the score according to that structure. The theory&#x27;s basic tenets can be viewed as a way of defining tonality in music. A Schenkerian analysis of a passage of music shows hierarchical relationships among its pitches, and draws conclusions about the structure of the passage from this hierarchy. The analysis makes use of a specialized symbolic form of musical notation that Schenker devised to demonstrate various techniques of elaboration. The most fundamental concept of Schenker&#x27;s theory of tonality may be that of &quot;tonal space&quot;. The intervals between the notes of the tonic triad form a &quot;tonal space&quot; that is filled with passing and neighbour notes, producing new triads and new tonal spaces, open for further elaborations until the surface of the work (the score) is reached.

Although Schenker himself usually presents his analyses in the generative direction, starting from the fundamental structure (&quot;Ursatz&quot;) to reach the score, the practice of Schenkerian analysis more often is reductive, starting from the score and showing how it can be reduced to its fundamental structure. The graph of the &quot;Ursatz&quot; is arrhythmic, as is a strict-counterpoint cantus firmus exercise. Even at intermediate levels of the reduction, rhythmic notation (open and closed noteheads, beams and flags) shows not rhythm but the hierarchical relationships between the pitch-events. Schenkerian analysis is &quot;subjective&quot;. There is no mechanical procedure involved and the analysis reflects the musical intuitions of the analyst. The analysis represents a way of hearing (and reading) a piece of music.

Transformational theory is a branch of music theory developed by David Lewin in the 1980s, and formally introduced in his 1987 work, &quot;Generalized Musical Intervals and Transformations&quot;. The theory, which models musical transformations as elements of a mathematical group, can be used to analyze both tonal and atonal music. The goal of transformational theory is to change the focus from musical objects—such as the &quot;C major chord&quot; or &quot;G major chord&quot;—to relations between objects. Thus, instead of saying that a C major chord is followed by G major, a transformational theorist might say that the first chord has been &quot;transformed&quot; into the second by the &quot;Dominant operation.&quot; (Symbolically, one might write &quot;Dominant(C major) = G major.&quot;) While traditional musical set theory focuses on the makeup of musical objects, transformational theory focuses on the intervals or types of musical motion that can occur. According to Lewin&#x27;s description of this change in emphasis, &quot;[The transformational] attitude does not ask for some observed measure of extension between reified &#x27;points&#x27;; rather it asks: &#x27;If I am &quot;at&quot; s and wish to get to t, what characteristic &quot;gesture&quot; should I perform in order to arrive there?&#x27;&quot;

===Music perception and cognition===
Music psychology or the psychology of music may be regarded as a branch of both psychology and musicology. It aims to explain and understand musical behavior and experience, including the processes through which music is perceived, created, responded to, and incorporated into everyday life. Modern music psychology is primarily empirical; its knowledge tends to advance on the basis of interpretations of data collected by systematic observation of and interaction with human participants. Music psychology is a field of research with practical relevance for many areas, including music performance, composition, education, criticism, and therapy, as well as investigations of human aptitude, skill, intelligence, creativity, and social behavior.

Music psychology can shed light on non-psychological aspects of musicology and musical practice. For example, it contributes to music theory through investigations of the perception and computational modelling of musical structures such as melody, harmony, tonality, rhythm, meter, and form. Research in music history can benefit from systematic study of the history of musical syntax, or from psychological analyses of composers and compositions in relation to perceptual, affective, and social responses to their music.

===Genre and technique===
A music genre is a conventional category that identifies some pieces of music as belonging to a shared tradition or set of conventions. It is to be distinguished from &quot;musical form&quot; and &quot;musical style&quot;, although in practice these terms are sometimes used interchangeably.

Music can be divided into different genres in many different ways. The artistic nature of music means that these classifications are often subjective and controversial, and some genres may overlap. There are even varying academic definitions of the term &quot;genre &quot;itself. In his book &quot;Form in Tonal Music&quot;, Douglass M. Green distinguishes between genre and form. He lists madrigal, motet, canzona, ricercar, and dance as examples of genres from the Renaissance period. To further clarify the meaning of &quot;genre&quot;, Green writes, &quot;Beethoven&#x27;s Op. 61 and Mendelssohn&#x27;s Op. 64 are identical in genre—both are violin concertos—but different in form. However, Mozart&#x27;s Rondo for Piano, K. 511, and the &quot;Agnus Dei&quot; from his Mass, K. 317 are quite different in genre but happen to be similar in form.&quot; Some, like Peter van der Merwe, treat the terms &quot;genre&quot; and &quot;style&quot; as the same, saying that &quot;genre&quot; should be defined as pieces of music that came from the same style or &quot;basic musical language.&quot;

Others, such as Allan F. Moore, state that &quot;genre&quot; and &quot;style&quot; are two separate terms, and that secondary characteristics such as subject matter can also differentiate between genres. A music genre or subgenre may also be defined by the musical techniques, the style, the cultural context, and the content and spirit of the themes. Geographical origin is sometimes used to identify a music genre, though a single geographical category will often include a wide variety of subgenres. Timothy Laurie argues that &quot;since the early 1980s, genre has graduated from being a subset of popular music studies to being an almost ubiquitous framework for constituting and evaluating musical research objects&quot;.

Musical technique is the ability of instrumental and vocal musicians to exert optimal control of their instruments or vocal cords to produce precise musical effects. Improving technique generally entails practicing exercises that improve muscular sensitivity and agility. To improve technique, musicians often practice fundamental patterns of notes such as the natural, minor, major, and chromatic scales, minor and major triads, dominant and diminished sevenths, formula patterns and arpeggios. For example, triads and sevenths teach how to play chords with accuracy and speed. Scales teach how to move quickly and gracefully from one note to another (usually by step). Arpeggios teach how to play broken chords over larger intervals. Many of these components of music are found in compositions, for example, a scale is a very common element of classical and romantic era compositions.

Heinrich Schenker argued that musical technique&#x27;s &quot;most striking and distinctive characteristic&quot; is repetition. Works known as études (meaning &quot;study&quot;) are also frequently used for the improvement of technique.

===Mathematics===

Music theorists sometimes use mathematics to understand music, and although music has no axiomatic foundation in modern mathematics, mathematics is &quot;the basis of sound&quot; and sound itself &quot;in its musical aspects... exhibits a remarkable array of number properties&quot;, simply because nature itself &quot;is amazingly mathematical&quot;. The attempt to structure and communicate new ways of composing and hearing music has led to musical applications of set theory, abstract algebra and number theory. Some composers have incorporated the golden ratio and Fibonacci numbers into their work. There is a long history of examining the relationships between music and mathematics. Though ancient Chinese, Egyptians and Mesopotamians are known to have studied the mathematical principles of sound, the Pythagoreans (in particular Philolaus and Archytas) of ancient Greece were the first researchers known to have investigated the expression of musical scales in terms of numerical ratios.

In the modern era, musical set theory uses the language of mathematical set theory in an elementary way to organize musical objects and describe their relationships. To analyze the structure of a piece of (typically atonal) music using musical set theory, one usually starts with a set of tones, which could form motives or chords. By applying simple operations such as transposition and inversion, one can discover deep structures in the music. Operations such as transposition and inversion are called isometries because they preserve the intervals between tones in a set. Expanding on the methods of musical set theory, some theorists have used abstract algebra to analyze music. For example, the pitch classes in an equally tempered octave form an abelian group with 12 elements. It is possible to describe just intonation in terms of a free abelian group.

===Serial composition and set theory===
In music theory, serialism is a method or technique of composition that uses a series of values to manipulate different musical elements. Serialism began primarily with Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s twelve-tone technique, though his contemporaries were also working to establish serialism as one example of post-tonal thinking. Twelve-tone technique orders the twelve notes of the chromatic scale, forming a row or series and providing a unifying basis for a composition&#x27;s melody, harmony, structural progressions, and variations. Other types of serialism also work with sets, collections of objects, but not necessarily with fixed-order series, and extend the technique to other musical dimensions (often called &quot;parameters&quot;), such as duration, dynamics, and timbre. The idea of serialism is also applied in various ways in the visual arts, design, and architecture

&quot;Integral serialism&quot; or &quot;total serialism&quot; is the use of series for aspects such as duration, dynamics, and register as well as pitch. Other terms, used especially in Europe to distinguish post-World War II serial music from twelve-tone music and its American extensions, are &quot;general serialism&quot; and &quot;multiple serialism&quot;.

Musical set theory provides concepts for categorizing musical objects and describing their relationships. Many of the notions were first elaborated by Howard Hanson (1960) in connection with tonal music, and then mostly developed in connection with atonal music by theorists such as Allen Forte (1973), drawing on the work in twelve-tone theory of Milton Babbitt. The concepts of set theory are very general and can be applied to tonal and atonal styles in any equally tempered tuning system, and to some extent more generally than that.

One branch of musical set theory deals with collections (sets and permutations) of pitches and pitch classes (pitch-class set theory), which may be ordered or unordered, and can be related by musical operations such as transposition, inversion, and complementation. The methods of musical set theory are sometimes applied to the analysis of rhythm as well.

===Musical semiotics===
Music semiology (semiotics) is the study of signs as they pertain to music on a variety of levels. Following Roman Jakobson, Kofi Agawu adopts the idea of musical semiosis being introversive or extroversive—that is, musical signs within a text and without. &quot;Topics&quot;, or various musical conventions (such as horn calls, dance forms, and styles), have been treated suggestively by Agawu, among others. The notion of gesture is beginning to play a large role in musico-semiotic enquiry.

:&quot;There are strong arguments that music inhabits a semiological realm which, on both ontogenetic and phylogenetic levels, has developmental priority over verbal language.&quot;

Writers on music semiology include Kofi Agawu (on topical theory, Heinrich Schenker, Robert Hatten (on topic, gesture), Raymond Monelle (on topic, musical meaning), Jean-Jacques Nattiez (on introversive taxonomic analysis and ethnomusicological applications), Anthony Newcomb (on narrativity), and Eero Tarasti.

Roland Barthes, himself a semiotician and skilled amateur pianist, wrote about music in &quot;Image-Music-Text,&quot; &quot;The Responsibilities of Form,&quot; and &quot;Eiffel Tower,&quot; though he did not consider music to be a semiotic system.

Signs, meanings in music, happen essentially through the connotations of sounds, and through the social construction, appropriation and amplification of certain meanings associated with these connotations. The work of Philip Tagg (&quot;Ten Little Tunes&quot;, &quot;Fernando the Flute&quot;, &quot;Music&#x27;s Meanings&quot;) provides one of the most complete and systematic analysis of the relation between musical structures and connotations in western and especially popular, television and film music. The work of Leonard B. Meyer in &quot;Style and Music&quot; theorizes the relationship between ideologies and musical structures and the phenomena of style change, and focuses on romanticism as a case study.

===Education and careers===

Music theory in the practical sense has been a part of education at conservatories and music schools for centuries, but the status music theory currently has within academic institutions is relatively recent. In the 1970s, few universities had dedicated music theory programs, many music theorists had been trained as composers or historians, and there was a belief among theorists that the teaching of music theory was inadequate and that the subject was not properly recognised as a scholarly discipline in its own right. A growing number of scholars began promoting the idea that music theory should be taught by theorists, rather than composers, performers or music historians. This led to the founding of the Society for Music Theory in the United States in 1977. In Europe, the French &quot;Société d&#x27;Analyse musicale&quot; was founded in 1985. It called the First European Conference of Music Analysis for 1989, which resulted in the foundation of the &quot;Société belge d&#x27;Analyse musicale&quot; in Belgium and the &quot;Gruppo analisi e teoria musicale&quot; in Italy the same year, the &quot;Society for Music Analysis&quot; in the UK in 1991, the &quot;Vereniging voor Muziektheorie&quot; in the Netherlands in 1999 and the &quot;Gesellschaft für Musiktheorie&quot; in Germany in 2000. They were later followed by the Russian Society for Music Theory in 2013, the Polish Society for Music Analysis in 2015 and the &quot;Sociedad de Análisis y Teoría Musical&quot; in Spain in 2020, and others are in construction. These societies coordinate the publication of music theory scholarship and support the professional development of music theory researchers. They formed in 2018 a network of European societies for Theory and/or Analysis of Music, the EuroT&amp;AM

As part of their initial training, music theorists will typically complete a B.Mus or a B.A. in music (or a related field) and in many cases an M.A. in music theory. Some individuals apply directly from a bachelor&#x27;s degree to a PhD, and in these cases, they may not receive an M.A. In the 2010s, given the increasingly interdisciplinary nature of university graduate programs, some applicants for music theory PhD programs may have academic training both in music and outside of music (e.g., a student may apply with a B.Mus. and a Masters in Music Composition or Philosophy of Music).

Most music theorists work as instructors, lecturers or professors in colleges, universities or conservatories. The job market for tenure-track professor positions is very competitive: with an average of around 25 tenure-track positions advertised per year in the past decade, 80–100 PhD graduates are produced each year (according to the Survey of Earned Doctorates) who compete not only with each other for those positions but with job seekers that received PhD&#x27;s in previous years who are still searching for a tenure-track job. Applicants must hold a completed PhD or the equivalent degree (or expect to receive one within a year of being hired—called an &quot;ABD&quot;, for &quot;All But Dissertation&quot; stage) and (for more senior positions) have a strong record of publishing in peer-reviewed journals. Some PhD-holding music theorists are only able to find insecure positions as sessional lecturers. The job tasks of a music theorist are the same as those of a professor in any other humanities discipline: teaching undergraduate and/or graduate classes in this area of specialization and, in many cases some general courses (such as Music appreciation or Introduction to Music Theory), conducting research in this area of expertise, publishing research articles in peer-reviewed journals, authoring book chapters, books or textbooks, traveling to conferences to present papers and learn about research in the field, and, if the program includes a graduate school, supervising M.A. and PhD students and giving them guidance on the preparation of their theses and dissertations. Some music theory professors may take on senior administrative positions in their institution, such as Dean or Chair of the School of Music.

<doc id="54789" wikidata="Q1073063" url="?curid=54789" title="Recursively enumerable language">
<text>In mathematics, logic and computer science, a formal language is called recursively enumerable (also recognizable, partially decidable, semidecidable, Turing-acceptable or Turing-recognizable) if it is a recursively enumerable subset in the set of all possible words over the alphabet of the language, i.e., if there exists a Turing machine which will enumerate all valid strings of the language.

Recursively enumerable languages are known as type-0 languages in the Chomsky hierarchy of formal languages. All regular, context-free, context-sensitive and recursive languages are recursively enumerable.

The class of all recursively enumerable languages is called [[RE (complexity)|RE]].

==Definitions==
There are three equivalent definitions of a recursively enumerable language:

# A recursively enumerable language is a recursively enumerable subset in the set of all possible words over the alphabet of the language.
# A recursively enumerable language is a formal language for which there exists a Turing machine (or other computable function) which will enumerate all valid strings of the language. Note that if the language is infinite, the enumerating algorithm provided can be chosen so that it avoids repetitions, since we can test whether the string produced for number &quot;n&quot; is &quot;already&quot; produced for a number which is less than &quot;n&quot;. If it already is produced, use the output for input &quot;n&quot;+1 instead (recursively), but again, test whether it is &quot;new&quot;.
# A recursively enumerable language is a formal language for which there exists a Turing machine (or other computable function) that will halt and accept when presented with any string in the language as input but may either halt and reject or loop forever when presented with a string not in the language. Contrast this to recursive languages, which require that the Turing machine halts in all cases.

All regular, context-free, context-sensitive and recursive languages are recursively enumerable.

Post&#x27;s theorem shows that RE, together with its complement co-RE, correspond to the first level of the arithmetical hierarchy.

==Example==
The set of halting Turing machines is recursively enumerable but not recursive. Indeed, one can run the Turing machine and accept if the machine halts, hence it is recursively enumerable. On the other hand, the problem is undecidable.

Some other recursively enumerable languages that are not recursive include:

* Post correspondence problem 
* Mortality (computability theory)
* Entscheidungsproblem

==Closure properties==
Recursively enumerable languages (REL) are closed under the following operations. That is, if &quot;L&quot; and &quot;P&quot; are two recursively enumerable languages, then the following languages are recursively enumerable as well:

* the Kleene star formula_1 of &quot;L&quot;
* the concatenation formula_2 of &quot;L&quot; and &quot;P&quot;
* the union formula_3
* the intersection formula_4.

Recursively enumerable languages are not closed under set difference or complementation. The set difference formula_5 is recursively enumerable if formula_6 is recursive. If formula_7 is recursively enumerable, then the complement of formula_7 is recursively enumerable if and only if formula_7 is also recursive.
