<text>The Long March rockets are a family of expendable launch system rockets operated by the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation. The rockets are named after the Chinese Red Army&#x27;s 1934–35 Long March military retreat during the Chinese Civil War.

The Long March series has performed more than 500 launches, including missions to low Earth orbit, Sun-synchronous orbit, geostationary transfer orbit, and Earth-Moon transfer orbit. The new-generation carrier rockets, Long March 5, Long March 6, Long March 7, Long March 11, and Long March 8, have made their maiden flights. Among them, the Long March 5 has a low-Earth orbit carrying capacity of 25,000 kilograms, and a geosynchronous transfer orbit carrying capacity of 14,000 kilograms.

== History ==

China used the Long March 1 rocket to launch its first satellite, Dong Fang Hong 1 (lit. &quot;The East is Red 1&quot;), into low Earth orbit on 24 April 1970, becoming the fifth nation to achieve independent launch capability. Early launches had an inconsistent record, focusing on the launching of Chinese satellites. The Long March 1 was quickly replaced by the Long March 2 family of launchers.
=== Entry into commercial launch market ===

After the U.S. Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; was destroyed in 1986, a growing commercial backlog gave China the chance to enter the international launch market. In September 1988, U.S. President Ronald Reagan agreed to allow U.S. satellites to be launched on Chinese rockets. Reagan&#x27;s satellite export policy would continue to 1998, through Bush and Clinton administrations, with 20 or more approvals. AsiaSat 1, which had originally been launched by the Space Shuttle and retrieved by another Space Shuttle after a failure, was launched by a Long March 3 in 1990 as the first foreign payload on a Chinese rocket.

However, major setbacks occurred in 1992–1996. The Long March 2E was designed with a defective payload fairing, which collapsed when faced with the rocket&#x27;s excessive vibration. After just seven launches, the Long March 2E destroyed the Optus B2 and Apstar 2 satellites and damaged AsiaSat 2. The Long March 3B also experienced a catastrophic failure in 1996, veering off course shortly after liftoff and crashing into a nearby village. At least 6 people were killed on the ground, and the Intelsat 708 satellite was also destroyed. A Long March 3 also experienced a partial failure in August 1996 during the launch of Chinasat-7. Six Long March rockets (Chang Zheng 2C/SD) launched 12 Iridium satellites, about a sixth of Iridium satellites in the original fleet.

=== United States embargo on Chinese launches ===
The involvement of United States companies in the Apstar 2 and Intelsat 708 investigations caused great controversy in the United States. In the Cox Report, the United States Congress accused Space Systems/Loral and Hughes Aircraft Company of transferring information that would improve the design of Chinese rockets and ballistic missiles. Although the Long March was allowed to launch its commercial backlog, the United States Department of State has not approved any satellite export licenses to China since 1998. ChinaSat 8, which had been scheduled for launch in April 1999 on a Long March 3B rocket, was placed in storage, sold to the Singapore company ProtoStar, and finally launched on a European rocket Ariane 5 in 2008.

From 2005 to 2012, Long March rockets launched ITAR-free satellites made by the European company Thales Alenia Space. However, Thales Alenia was forced to discontinue its ITAR-free satellite line in 2013 after the United States State Department fined a United States company for selling ITAR components. Thales Alenia Space had long complained that &quot;every satellite nut and bolt&quot; was being ITAR-restricted, and the European Space Agency (ESA) accused the United States of using ITAR to block exports to China instead of protecting technology. In 2016, an official at the United States Bureau of Industry and Security confirmed that &quot;no U.S.-origin content, regardless of significance, regardless of whether it is incorporated into a foreign-made item, can go to China&quot;. The European aerospace industry is working on developing replacements for United States satellite components.

=== Return to success ===

After the failures of 1992–1996, the troublesome Long March 2E was withdrawn from the market. Design changes were made to improve the reliability of Long March rockets. From October 1996 to April 2009, the Long March rocket family delivered 75 consecutive successful launches, including several major milestones in space flight:
* On 15 October 2003, the Long March 2F rocket successfully launched the &quot;Shenzhou 5&quot; spacecraft, carrying China&#x27;s first astronaut into space. China became the third nation with independent human spaceflight capability, after the Soviet Union/Russia and the United States. 
* On 1 June 2007, Long March rockets completed their 100th launch overall. 
* On 24 October 2007, the Long March 3A successfully launched (10:05 UTC) the &quot;Chang&#x27;e 1&quot; lunar orbiting spacecraft from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center.

The Long March rockets have subsequently maintained an excellent reliability record. Since 2010, Long March launches have made up 15–25% of all space launches globally. Growing domestic demand has maintained a healthy manifest. International deals have been secured through a package deal that bundles the launch with a Chinese satellite, circumventing the United States embargo.

== Payloads ==
The Long March is China&#x27;s primary expendable launch system family. The Shenzhou spacecraft and Chang&#x27;e lunar orbiters are also launched on the Long March rocket. The maximum payload for LEO is 25,000 kilograms (CZ-5B), the maximum payload for GTO is 14,000 kg (CZ-5). The next generation rocket Long March 5 variants will offer more payload in the future.

== Propellants ==

Long March 1&#x27;s 1st and 2nd stage used nitric acid and unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) propellants, and its upper stage used a spin-stabilized solid rocket engine.

Long March 2, Long March 3, Long March 4, the main stages and associated liquid rocket boosters use dinitrogen tetroxide (N2O4) as the oxidizing agent and UDMH as the fuel. The upper stages (third stage) of Long March 3 rockets use YF-73 and YF-75 engines, using liquid hydrogen (LH2) as the fuel and liquid oxygen (LOX) as the oxidizer.

The new generation of Long March rocket family, Long March 5 and its derivations Long March 6, Long March 7, Long March 8, and Long March 10 use non-toxic LOX/kerosene and LOX/LH2 liquid propellants (except in some upper stages where UDMH/N2O4 continues to be used).

Long March 9 is being developed as a LOX/CH4, or &quot;methalox&quot;, rocket.

Long March 11 is a solid-fuel rocket.

== Variants ==
The Long March rockets are organized into several series:
* Long March 1
* Long March 2
* Long March 3
* Long March 4
* Long March 5
* Long March 6
* Long March 7
* Long March 8
* Long March 9
* Long March 10
* Long March 11
* Long March 12

The Long March 5, 6 and 7 are a newer generation of rockets sharing the new 1200 kN class YF-100 engines, which burns RP-1 / LOX, unlike earlier 2, 3 and 4 series which uses more expensive and dangerous N2O4 / UDMH propellants. The 5 series is a heavy-lift launch vehicle, with a capacity of 25,000 kg to LEO while the 6 series is a small-lift launch vehicle with a capacity of 1,500 kg to LEO, and the 7 series is a medium-lift launch vehicle, with a capacity of 14,000 kg to LEO.

The Long March 10A is a partially-reusable crewed-rated rocket designed for LEO missions currently under development; the Long March 9 is initially designed to be partially reusable before becoming a fully reusable launcher.


=== Long March 8 ===
The Long March 8 is a new series of launch vehicles, which is geared towards Sun-synchronous orbit (SSO) launches. In early 2017, it was expected to be based on the Long March 7, and have two solid fuel boosters, and first launch by the end of 2018. By 2019, it was intended to be partially reusable. The first stage will have legs and grid fins (like Falcon 9) and it may land with side boosters still attached. The first Long March 8 was rolled out to for a test launch on or around 20 December 2020 and launched on 22 December 2020. The second flight with no side boosters occurred on 27 February 2022, sending a national record of 22 satellites into SSO.

=== Future development ===

==== Long March 9 ====
The Long March 9 (LM-9, CZ-9, or Changzheng 9, Chinese: 长征九号) is a Chinese super-heavy carrier rocket concept proposed in 2018 that is currently in study. It is planned for a maximum payload capacity of 140,000 kg to low Earth orbit (LEO), 50,000 kg to trans-lunar injection or 44,000 kg to Mars. Its first flight is expected by 2028 or 2029 in preparation for a lunar landing sometime in the 2030s; a sample return mission from Mars has been proposed as first major mission. It has been stated that around 70% of the hardware and components needed for a test flight are currently undergoing testing, with the first engine test to occur by the end of 2018. The 2011 proposed design would be a three-staged rocket, with the initial core having a diameter of 10 meters and use a cluster of four engines. Multiple variants of the rocket have been proposed, CZ-9 being the largest with four liquid-fuel boosters with the aforementioned LEO payload capacity of 140,000 kg, CZ-9A having just two boosters and a LEO payload capacity of 100,000 kg, and finally CZ-9B having just the core stage and a LEO payload capacity of 50,000 kg. Approved in 2021, the Long March 9 is classified as a super heavy-lift launch vehicle. A very different design of LM-9 was announced in June 2021, with more engines and no external boosters. Payload capacities are 160 tonnes to LEO and 53 tonnes to TLI.

==== Long March 10 ====

The Long March 10, previously known as the &quot;921 rocket&quot;, is under development for crewed lunar missions. The nickname &quot;921&quot; refers to the founding date of China&#x27;s human spaceflight program. Like the Long March 5, it uses 5-meter (16.4 ft) diameter rocket bodies and YF-100K engines, although with 7 engines on each of 3 cores. The launch weight is 2187 tonnes, delivering 25 tonnes into trans-lunar injection. The proposed crewed lunar mission uses two rockets; the crewed spacecraft and lunar landing stack launch separately and rendezvous in lunar orbit. Development was announced at the 2020 China Space Conference. As of 2022, the first flight of this triple-cored rocket is targeted for 2027.

== Origins ==
The Long March 1 rocket is derived from earlier Chinese 2-stage Intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) DF-4, or Dong Feng 4 missile, and Long March 2, Long March 3, Long March 4 rocket families are derivatives of the Chinese 2-stage Intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) DF-5, or Dong Feng 5 missile. However, like its counterparts in both the United States and in Russia, the differing needs of space rockets and strategic missiles have caused the development of space rockets and missiles to diverge. The main goal of a launch vehicle is to maximize payload, while for strategic missiles increased throw weight is much less important than the ability to launch quickly and to survive a first strike. This divergence has become clear in the next generation of Long March rockets, which use cryogenic propellants in sharp contrast to the next generation of strategic missiles, which are mobile and solid fuelled.

The next generation of Long March rocket, Long March 5 rocket family, is a brand new design, while Long March 6 and Long March 7 can be seen as derivations because they use the liquid rocket booster design of Long March 5 to build small-to-mid capacity launch vehicles.

== Launch sites ==
There are four launch centers in China. They are:
* Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center
* Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center
* Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site
* Xichang Satellite Launch Center

Most of the commercial satellite launches of Long March vehicles have been from Xichang Satellite Launch Center, located in Xichang, Sichuan province. Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site in Hainan province is under expansion and will be the main launch center for future commercial satellite launches. Long March launches also take place from the more military oriented Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in Gansu province from which the crewed Shenzhou spacecraft also launches. Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center is located in Shanxi province and focuses on the launches of Sun-synchronous orbit (SSO) satellites.

On 5 June 2019, China launched a Long March 11 rocket from a mobile launch platform in the Yellow Sea.

== Commercial launch services ==
China markets launch services under the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (China Great Wall Industry Corporation). Its efforts to launch communications satellites were dealt a blow in the mid-1990s after the United States stopped issuing export licenses to companies to allow them to launch on Chinese launch vehicles out of fear that this would help China&#x27;s military. In the face of this, Thales Alenia Space built the Chinasat-6B satellite with no components from the United States whatsoever. This allowed it to be launched on a Chinese launch vehicle without violating United States International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) restrictions. The launch, on a Long March 3B rocket, was successfully conducted on 5 July 2007.

A Chinese Long March 2D launched VRSS-1 (Venezuelan Remote Sensing Satellite-1) of Venezuela, &quot;Francisco de Miranda&quot; on 29 September 2012.

<text>The Dongfeng () series, typically abbreviated as &quot;DF missiles&quot;, are a family of short, medium, intermediate-range and intercontinental ballistic missiles operated by the Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army Rocket Force (formerly the Second Artillery Corps).

==History==
After the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance in 1950, the Soviet Union assisted China&#x27;s military R&amp;D with training, technical documentation, manufacturing-equipment and licensed production of Soviet weapons. In the area of ballistic missiles, the Soviets transferred R-1 (SS-1), R-2 (SS-2) and R-11F technology to China. The PRC based its first ballistic missiles on Soviet designs. Since then, China has made many advances in its ballistic-missile and rocket technology. For instance, the space-launch &quot;Long March&quot; rockets have their roots in the Dongfeng missiles.

==Dongfeng missiles==
=== Dongfeng 1 (SS-2)===
The first of the Dongfeng missiles, the DF-1 (SS-2, codenamed &#x27;1059&#x27;, initially &#x27;DF-1&#x27; , later the DF-3), was a licensed copy of the Soviet R-2 (SS-2 Sibling) short-range ballistic missile (SRBM), based on the German V-2 rocket. The DF-1 had a single RD-101 rocket engine, and used alcohol for fuel with liquid oxygen (LOX) as an oxidizer. The missile had maximum range of 550 km and a 500 kg payload. Limited numbers of DF-1 were produced in the 1960s, and have since been retired.

=== Dongfeng 2 (CSS-1)===

The DF-2 (CSS-1) is China&#x27;s first medium-range ballistic missile (MRBM), with a 1,250 km range and a 15-20 kt nuclear warhead. It received the western designation of CSS-1 (stands for &quot;China Surface-to-Surface&quot;). It was long noted by western observers that the DF-2 could be a copy of the Soviet R-5 Pobeda (SS-3 Shyster), as they have identical look, range, engine and payload. The entire documentation for R-5 had been delivered from Soviet Union to China in the late 1950s. But some western authors still attribute the design to Chinese specialists Xie Guangxuan, Liang Sili, Liu Chuanru, Liu Yuan, Lin Shuang, and Ren Xinmin. The first DF-2 failed in its launch test in 1962, leading to the improved DF-2A. The DF-2A was used to carry out China&#x27;s test of a live warhead on a rocket on 27 October 1966 (detonated in the atmosphere above Lop Nor), and was in operational service from the late 1960s. All DF-2 were retired from active duty in the 1980s.

===Dongfeng 3 (CSS-2)===

The DF-3 (CSS-2) is often considered China&#x27;s first &quot;domestic&quot; intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM). The common ICBM design was greatly influenced by the Soviet R-14 Chusovaya missile and the first stage engine itself was a direct copy of the С.2.1100/С.2.1150 La-350 booster engine developed by Aleksei Isaev at OKB-2 (NII-88). Design leadership has been attributed to both Tu Shou&#x27;e and Sun Jiadong. The missile was produced at Factory 211 (Capital Astronautics Co., [首都航天机械公司], also known as Capital Machine Shop, [首都机械厂]). The 2,500 km DF-3 was originally designed with a 2,000 kg payload to carry an atomic (later thermonuclear) warhead. A further improved DF-3A with 3,000 km range (~4,000 km with reduced payload) was developed in 1981, and exported to Saudi Arabia with a conventional high-explosive warhead. The DF-3&#x27;s range of 2,810 km means it is just short of being able to target Guam, although the 2012 DOD report on China&#x27;s military power states that they have a range of 3,300 km, which would be enough to target Guam. The 2013 Pentagon report on China&#x27;s military power confirms the DF-3&#x27;s 3,300 km range, and its maps show Guam being within the DF-3&#x27;s range. All DF-3/DF-3A&#x27;s were retired by the mid-2010s and replaced by the DF-21.

===Dongfeng 4 (CSS-3)===

The DF-4 (CSS-3) &quot;Chingyu&quot; is China&#x27;s first two-stage ballistic missile, with 5,550-7,000 km range and 2,200 kg payload (3 Mt nuclear warhead). It was developed in late 1960s to provide strike capability against Moscow and Guam. The DF-4 missile also served as basis for China&#x27;s first space launch vehicle, Chang Zheng 1 (Long March 1). Approx. 20 DF-4&#x27;s remain in service, and are scheduled to be replaced by DF-31 by 2010–2015.

===Dongfeng 5 (CSS-4)===

The DF-5 (CSS-4) is an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), designed to carry a 3 megaton (Mt) nuclear warhead to distance up to 12,000 km. The DF-5 is a silo-based, two-stage missile, and its rocket served as the basis for the space-launch vehicle Fengbao-Tempest (FB-1) used to launch satellites. The missile was developed in the 1960s, but did not enter service until 1981. An improved variant, the DF-5A, was produced in the mid 1990s with improved range (&gt;13,000 km). Currently, an estimated 24-36 DF-5A&#x27;s are in service as China&#x27;s primary ICBM force. If the DF-5A is launched from the eastern part of the Qinghai province, it can reach cities like Los Angeles, Sacramento and San Francisco. If it is launched from the most eastern parts of northeastern provinces, it can cover all of the mainland of the United States.

===Dongfeng 11 (CSS-7)===
The DF-11 (CSS-7, also M-11 for export), is a road-mobile SRBM designed by Wang Zhenhua at the Sanjiang Missile Corporation (also known as the 066 Base) in the late 1970s. Unlike previous Chinese ballistic missiles, the DF-11 use solid fuel, which greatly reduces launch preparation time to around 15–30 minutes, while liquid-fuelled missiles such as the DF-5 require up to 2 hours of pre-launch preparation. The DF-11 has a range of 300 km and an 800 kg payload. An improved DF-11A version has increased range of &gt;825 km. The range of the M-11 does not violate the limits set by the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR). Estimates on the number of DF-11s in service vary between 500 and 600.

=== Dongfeng 12 (CSS-X-15)===
The DF-12 (CSS-X-15) is an SRBM formerly known as the M20. The change in designation signalled a shift in fielding to the Second Artillery Corps, making it possible the missile could be armed with a tactical nuclear warhead. Images of it bear a resemblance to the Russian 9K720 Iskander missile which, although not purchased by China from Russia, could have been acquired from former Soviet states. Like the Iskander, the DF-12 reportedly has built-in countermeasures including terminal maneuverability to survive against missile defense systems. Range is officially between , but given MTCR restrictions, actual maximum range may be up to . With guidance provided by inertial navigation and Beidou, accuracy is 30 meters CEP; since the missile is controlled throughout the entire flight path, it can be re-targeted mid-flight. The DF-12 is long, in diameter, has a take-off weight of , and an warhead that can deliver cluster, high explosive fragmentation, penetration, or high-explosive incendiary payloads. They are fired from an 8×8 transporter erector launcher (TEL) that holds two missiles.

An anti-ship ballistic missile export variant of the M20, called A/MGG-20B (M20B), was unveiled at the 2018 Zhuhai Airshow.

===Dongfeng 15 (CSS-6)===
The DF-15 (CSS-6, also M-9 for export) was developed by the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC, previously known as the 5th Aerospace Academy)&#x27;s Academy of Rocket Motor Technology (ARMT, also known as the 4th Academy). The missile is a single-stage, solid-fuel SRBM with a 600 km range and a 500 kg payload. During the 1995-1996 Taiwan strait crisis, the PLA launched six DF-15&#x27;s near Taiwan in a demonstration of the missile&#x27;s capability. Although the DF-15 is marketed for export, its range would violate the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) agreement, and thus no DF-15 has been exported to date. Approximately 300-350 DF-15&#x27;s are in service with the PLA Rocket Force.

=== Dongfeng 16 (CSS-11) ===

The DF-16 (CSS-11) is a new-model missile that has a longer range than the DF-15 (between ). A Taiwan official announced on 16 March 2011 that Taiwan believed China had begun deploying the missiles. The DF-16 represents an increased threat to Taiwan because it is more difficult to intercept for anti-ballistic missiles systems such as the MIM-104 Patriot PAC-3. Due to its increased range, the missile has to climb to higher altitudes before descending, giving more time for gravity to accelerate it on re-entry, faster than a PAC-3 could effectively engage it. The DF-16 is an MRBM longer and wider than previous models with a warhead and 5-10 meter accuracy. Its bi-conic warhead structure leaves room for potential growth to include specialized terminally guided and deep penetrating warheads. It is launched from a 10×10 wheeled TEL similar to that of the DF-21, but instead of a &quot;cold launch&quot; missile storage tube it uses a new protective &quot;shell&quot; to cover the missile. Nuclear capable.

The missile was shown to the public during the 2015 China Victory Day Parade in Beijing celebrating 70-year anniversary of the end of World War II.

=== Dongfeng 17 ===

The DF-17 is a medium-range ballistic missile used to launch the DF-ZF hypersonic glide vehicle. The DF-ZF is a conventional warhead, although US intelligence considers it to be nuclear capable as well. The system entered service in the second half of 2019.

===Dongfeng 21 (CSS-5)===
The DF-21 (CSS-5) is a two-stage, solid-fuel MRBM developed by the 2nd Aerospace Academy (now China Changfeng Mechanics and Electronics Technology Academy) in late 1970s. It was the first solid-fuelled ballistic missile deployed by the Second Artillery Corp. The missile carries a single 500 kt nuclear warhead, with up to range. The DF-21 also served as the basis for the submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) JL-1 (CSS-N-3), used on the &quot;Xia&quot;-class SSBN. In 1996, an improved variant, the DF-21A, was introduced. As of 2010, 60-80 DF-21/DF-21A were estimated to be in service; this number may have increased since then. Sources say Saudi Arabia bought a DF-21 in 2007.

The latest variant, the DF-21D, has a maximum range exceeding 1,450 kilometres (900 mi; 780 nmi) according to the U.S. National Air and Space Intelligence Center. It is hailed as the world&#x27;s first anti-ship ballistic missile (ASBM) system, capable of targeting a moving carrier strike group from long-range, land-based mobile launchers. The DF-21D is thought to employ maneuverable reentry vehicles (MaRVs) with a terminal guidance system. It may have been tested in 2005–2006, and the launch of the Jianbing-5/YaoGan-1 and Jianbing-6/YaoGan-2 satellites offering targeting information from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and visual imaging respectively.

===Dongfeng 25===

The DF-25 was a mobile-launch, two-stage, solid-fuel IRBM with a range of . Development was allegedly cancelled in 1996. The U.S. Department of Defense in its 2013 report to Congress on China&#x27;s military developments made no mention of the DF-25 as a missile in service.

===Dongfeng 26 (CSS-18)===

The DF-26C is an IRBM with a range of at least , far enough to reach U.S. naval bases in Guam. Few details are known, but it is believed to be solid-fuelled and road-mobile, allowing it to be stored in underground bunkers and fired at short notice, hence difficult to counter. It is possible that the DF-26C is a follow-up version of the DF-21. Possible warheads include conventional, nuclear or even maneuverable anti-ship and hypersonic glide warheads.

===Dongfeng 27===
The DF-27 (CH-SS-X-24) is an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) equipped with a hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV) warhead. The ballistic missile was in development as of 2021, with a range of 5,000 km to 8,000 km.

===Dongfeng 31 (CSS-10)===
The DF-31 (CSS-10) is China&#x27;s newest road-mobile, solid-fuel ICBM developed by the 4th Aerospace Academy (now ARMT). The DF-31 has range of 8,000+ km, and can carry a single 1,000 kt warhead, or up to three 20-150 kt MIRV warheads. An improved version, the DF-31A, has range of 11,000+ km, far enough to reach Los Angeles from Beijing. The DF-31 was developed to replace many of China&#x27;s older ballistic missiles, and served as basis to the new JL-2 (CSS-NX-4/CSS-NX-5) SLBM. In 2009, approx. 30 DF-31/DF-31A are estimated to be in service; it is possible this number may have increased since then. 12 were displayed at the 2009 military parade in Beijing commemorating the 60th anniversary of the PRC&#x27;s founding.

The DF-31AG uses a mobile launcher with improved mobility. It made its first official public appearance in the 2017 PLA Day Parade.

===Dongfeng 41 (CSS-20)===

The DF-41 (CSS-20), capable of being armed with ten or twelve MIRV warheads, is China&#x27;s newest addition to its nuclear arsenal. With an estimated range between 12,000 - 15,000 km, it is believed to surpass the range of the US&#x27;s LGM-30 Minuteman ICBM to become the world&#x27;s longest range missile.

<text>Jefferson County is a county on the northern border of the U.S. state of New York. As of the 2020 census, the population was 116,721. Its county seat is Watertown. The county is named after Thomas Jefferson, third President of the United States of America. It is adjacent to Lake Ontario, southeast from the Canada–US border of Ontario. The county is part of the North Country region of the state.

Jefferson County comprises the Watertown-Fort Drum, NY Metropolitan Statistical Area. The popularity of the area as a summer tourist destination results in a dramatic increase of population during that season.

In 2014, it elected Colleen M. O&#x27;Neill as the first woman county sheriff in the state. She had served with the New York State Police for 32 years.

The United States Army&#x27;s 10th Mountain Division is based at Fort Drum. The base had a total population of nearly 13,000 according to the 2010 census.

==History==
When counties were established in the Province of New York in 1683, the present Jefferson County was part of Albany County. This was an enormous county, including the northern part of New York State as well as all of the present State of Vermont and, in theory, extending westward to the Pacific Ocean. This county was reduced in size on July 3, 1766, by the creation of Cumberland County, and further on March 16, 1770, by the creation of Gloucester County, both containing territory now in Vermont.

On March 12, 1772, what was left of Albany County was split into three parts, one remaining under the name Albany County. One of the other pieces, Tryon County, contained the western portion (and thus, since no western boundary was specified, theoretically still extended west to the Pacific). The eastern boundary of Tryon County was approximately west of the present city of Schenectady, and the county included the western part of the Adirondack Mountains and the area west of the West Branch of the Delaware River. The area then designated as Tryon County now includes 37 counties of New York State. The county was named for William Tryon, colonial governor of New York.

In the years subsequent to 1776, most of the Loyalists in Tryon County fled to Canada. In 1784, following the peace treaty that ended the American Revolutionary War, the name of Tryon County was changed to Montgomery County to honor the general, Richard Montgomery, who had captured several places in Canada and died attempting to capture the city of Quebec, replacing the name of the hated British governor.

In 1789, the size of Montgomery County was reduced by the creation of Ontario County from Montgomery. The area split off from Montgomery County was much larger than the present county, as it was later divided to form the present Allegany, Cattaraugus, Chautauqua, Erie, Genesee, Livingston, Monroe, Niagara, Orleans, Steuben, Wyoming, Yates, and parts of Schuyler and Wayne counties.

Jefferson County is part of Macomb&#x27;s Purchase of 1791.

In 1791, Herkimer County was one of three counties split off from Montgomery (the other two being Otsego, and Tioga County). This was much larger than the present county, however, and was reduced by a number of subsequent splits. The first one of these, in 1794, produced Onondaga County. This county was larger than the current Onondaga County, including the present Cayuga and Cortland Counties, and part of Oswego County.

Oneida County (as well as a part of Chenango County), was split off from Herkimer County in 1798.

Jefferson County was split off from Oneida County in 1805. In 1817, Carleton Island, captured from the British in the War of 1812, was annexed to the county. During the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the county was largely developed for agriculture.

By the early 20th centuries, Watertown was a city with the highest per capita number of millionaires in the United States. Local industrialists had made early fortunes from industries driven by water power. Mills were established along the falls of the Black River from the first half of the nineteenth century.

In 2019, Jefferson County and much of the rest of the North Country was identified as one of the most politically tolerant communities in America, according to an analysis by PredictWise.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has an area of , of which is land and (32%) is water. It is the fourth-largest county in New York by area.

Jefferson County is in New York State&#x27;s northern lobe, adjacent to the area where the Saint Lawrence River exits Lake Ontario. It is northeast of Syracuse, and northwest of Utica. The county is at the international border with Canada.

The Black River, which empties into Lake Ontario, is an important waterway in the county. Part of the Tug Hill Plateau is in the southern part of the county. The county contains part of the Thousand Islands in the St. Lawrence River, including such large islands as Carleton Island, Grindstone Island, and Wellesley Island.

<text>Herkimer County is a county in the U.S. state of New York. As of the 2020 census, the population was 60,139. Its county seat is Herkimer. The county was created in 1791 north of the Mohawk River out of part of Montgomery County. It is named after General Nicholas Herkimer, who died from battle wounds in 1777 after taking part in the Battle of Oriskany during the Revolutionary War. The county is part of the Mohawk Valley region of the state.

Herkimer County is part of the Utica–Rome Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

In 1791, Herkimer County was created as one of three counties split off from Montgomery (the other two being Otsego and Tioga counties) as New York State was developed after the American Revolutionary War. Its area was much larger than the present county, however, and was reduced subsequently as more counties were organized.

Part of Herkimer County was included in the Macomb&#x27;s Purchase of 1791, during the wide-scale sale of public lands after the state forced Iroquois tribes allied with the British during the war to cede their territory. Suddenly the state was selling of land in upstate, central and western New York.

In 1794, Onondaga County was split off from Herkimer County. This county was larger than the current Onondaga County, and included the present Cayuga, Cortland, and part of Oswego counties.

In 1798, portions of Herkimer and Tioga counties were taken to form Chenango County.

Another part of Herkimer was split off to form Oneida County. It was then larger than the current Oneida County, including the present Jefferson, Lewis, and part of Oswego counties.

In 1802, parts of Herkimer, Clinton and Montgomery counties were combined to form the new St. Lawrence County.

The rural economy was first based on general agriculture and then wheat, but after the opening of the Erie Canal, Herkimer farmers found that they could not compete with grain farmers to the west. By the mid-19th century, they had begun to specialize in dairy farming and created a cheese industry that supplied the New York City market, among others.

During the American Civil War, Herkimer contributed five companies to the 34th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment, leading to the unit&#x27;s nickname &quot;The Herkimer Regiment&quot;.

The Herkimer County Jail, constructed in 1834, was used to hold the murderer Chester Gillette before his trial at the Herkimer County Courthouse. The jail is now disused, except for tours by the Herkimer County Historical Society.

The Herkimer County shootings took place in 2013, killing five people.

==Government and politics==














Herkimer County is one of the most Republican counties in New York. Since 1884, it has voted for a Democratic presidential candidate only three times, with vote splitting due to a third-party candidate playing a role in two of those races. Since 2022, the entire county is within New York&#x27;s 21st congressional district, presently held by Republican Elise Stefanik.

The Herkimer County Legislature consists of 17 members, each elected from single-member districts. the county legislature is almost entirely Republican: the single Democratic legislator also ran on the Conservative Party line.

In 2025, the chairman of the Herkimer County Legislature took a plea deal settling charges of drug possession, an Open-container law violation, and failing to safely store a firearm.

<text>The Treaty of Belgrade, also known as the Belgrade Peace, was a peace treaty between the Habsburg Monarchy and Ottoman Empire, that was signed on September 18, 1739 in Belgrade (modern Serbia), thus ending the Austro–Turkish War (1737–1739). Agreed territorial changes were substantial, and also favorable for the Ottoman side, since Habsburgs had to cede three regions: the Banat of Craiova (modern Oltenia), the Kingdom of Serbia with Belgrade, and Bosnian section of Posavina, thus placing the newly defined Habsburg-Ottoman border on the rivers Sava and Danube.

==Negotiations==

During the final stages of the Austro-Turkish War (1737–1739), the main Habsburg army, commanded by field marshal Wallis suffered a strategic defeat at the Battle of Grocka (21–22 July, 1739), and retreated into the Belgrade Fortress, that was soon besieged by the Ottoman forces. 

Already on 31 July, the government in Vienna decided to relieve Wallis of his previously granted powers to negotiate with the Ottomans. Those powers were transferred to count Neipperg. On 10 August, the imperial government composed new instructions, that were approved by the emperor Charles VI and sent to Neipperg on 11 August. Arriving in the still Habsburg-held Belgrade with imperial instructions on 16 August, Neipperg proceeded to the camp of the Grand Vizier on 18 August. There he found himself increasingly isolated, and dependent on the French mediator, marquis Louis Sauveur de Villeneuve. On 1 September, Neipperg agreed to sign a preliminary peace agreement with the Ottomans, and then dispatched the news to the Emperor on the next day. Neipperg&#x27;s report arrived to Vienna on 7 September, provoking outrage, since it became obvious that he signed the agreement not knowing that already on 31 August, the Emperor sent him new instructions, an action that was followed by the governments decision to revoke Neipperg&#x27;s negotiating powers (3 September). On 5 September, while still not knowing that the preliminary treaty was already signed, the Emperor sent a letter to Neipperg, informing him that his diplomatic mission has ended. Only upon return to Belgrade from the Grand Vizier&#x27;s camp, Neipperg became aware of those new instructions and consequent decisions, realizing that he acted without valid negotiating powers, but it was to late for reversal, and further negotiations proceeded towards the conclusion of the final peace treaty.

==Treaty==
After some further negotiations, the final peace treaty was concluded on 18 September. It was also signed in the Grand vizier&#x27;s camp near Belgrade. By the Treaty of Belgrade, the Habsburgs agreed to cede three provinces to the Ottomans: the Banat of Craiova (modern Oltenia), the Kingdom of Serbia with Belgrade, and Bosnian section of Posavina. All of those territories were previously gained for the Habsburg Monarchy by the Treaty of Passarowitz in 1718, and remained under Habsburg rule until 1739. New demarcation line, under the Treaty of Belgrade, was set at the rivers Sava and Danube. 

The Treaty of Belgrade effectively ended the existence of the Habsburg-held Kingdom of Serbia, which had existed since 1718. Retreat of Habsburg forces was also followed by a major Serbian migration from regions that were ceded to the Ottomans. Those Serbian territories would await the next Habsburg-Ottoman war (1788–1791) to be again temporarily occupied by Habsburg forces in 1788-1789, with the help of Serbian rebels.

The treaty is also notable for being one of the last international treaties to be written in Latin.

==Aftermath==
The Habsburg decision to enter negotiations in August 1739 forced its ally Russia to also accept peace talks, trough French mediation, that resulted in a separate preliminary peace treaty that was signed on the same day (18 September) in Belgrade, and was later finalized by the Treaty of Niš (3 October), thus ending the Russo–Turkish War (1735–1739).

After the formal ratification of both peace treaties, diplomatic instruments were exchanged and the final convention was signed in Constantinople on 28 December 1739, also trough the French mediation, thus concluding the war. In the meantime, both count Neipperg and field marshal Wallis were arrested by the Habsburg state authorities and accused for the unfavorable outcome of negotiations. Only after the Emperor&#x27;s death in 1740 they were pardoned.

<text>The Peak District is an upland area in central-northern England, at the southern end of the Pennines. Mostly in Derbyshire, it extends into Cheshire, Greater Manchester, Staffordshire, West Yorkshire and South Yorkshire. It is subdivided into the Dark Peak, moorland dominated by gritstone, and the White Peak, a limestone area with valleys and gorges. The Dark Peak forms an arc on the north, east and west of the district, and the White Peak covers central and southern areas. The highest point is Kinder Scout (). Most of the area is within the Peak District National Park, a protected landscape designated in 1951.

A 2021 report states that &quot;the Park’s own population numbers around 40,000 and supports an estimated 18,000 jobs, predominantly through farming, manufacturing and, inevitably, tourism&quot;.

The area has been inhabited since the Mesolithic era; it was largely used for agricultural purposes until mining arose in the Middle Ages. During the Industrial Revolution, several cotton mills were constructed in the area&#x27;s valleys by Richard Arkwright. As mining declined, quarrying grew. Tourism came with the railways, spurred by the landscape, spa towns and Castleton&#x27;s show caves.

==Geography==
The Peak District forms the southern extremity of the Pennines. Much of it is upland above , its highest point being Kinder Scout at . Despite its name, the landscape has fewer sharp peaks than rounded hills, plateaus, valleys, limestone gorges and gritstone escarpments (the &quot;edges&quot;). The mostly rural area is surrounded by conurbations and large urban areas, including Manchester, Huddersfield, Sheffield, Derby and Stoke-on-Trent.

The national park has formal boundaries. It covers most of the Dark Peak and White Peak, but the wider Peak District is less well defined. The Dark Peak is largely uninhabited moorland and gritstone escarpments in the northern Peak District and its eastern and western margins. It encloses the central and southern White Peak, which is where most settlements, farmland and limestone gorges are found. Three of Natural England&#x27;s National Character Areas (NCAs) cover parts of it. The Dark Peak NCA includes the northern and eastern parts of the Dark Peak and the White Peak NCA most of the White Peak. The western margins of the Dark Peak are in the South West Peak NCA, where farmland and pastured valleys are found with gritstone edges and moorland. Outside the park, the wider Peak District often includes the area approximately between Disley and Sterndale Moor, encompassing Buxton and the Peak Dale corridor. It may also include some of the outer fringes and foothills, such as the Churnet and lower Derwent Valleys. The region is mostly surrounded by lowlands with gritstone moorlands of the South Pennines to the north, separated approximately by the Tame Valley, Standedge and Holme Valley.

The national park covers , including most of the region in Derbyshire and extends into Staffordshire, Cheshire, Greater Manchester and South and West Yorkshire. Its northern limit is on a track near Deer Hill in Meltham; its southernmost point is on the A52 road near Ashbourne. The boundaries were drawn to exclude built-up and industrial areas; in particular Buxton and the quarries at the end of the Peak Dale corridor are surrounded on three sides by the park. Bakewell and many villages are in the national park, as is much of the rural west of Sheffield. In 2010 it became the fifth largest national park in England and Wales. In the UK, designation as a national park means that planning and other functions are provided by a national park authority, with additional restrictions that enhance protection from inappropriate development. Land within this national park as in others is in a mix of public and private ownership.

The National Trust, a charity that conserves historic and natural landscapes, owns about 12 per cent of the land in the national park. Its three estates (High Peak, White Peak and Longshaw) include ecologically or geologically significant areas at Bleaklow, Derwent Edge, Hope Woodlands, Kinder Scout, the Manifold valley, Mam Tor, Dovedale, Milldale and Winnats Pass. The park authority owns around 5 per cent; other major landowners include several water companies.
===Settlements===

Bakewell is the largest settlement and only town in the national park and the site of the National Park Authority offices. Its five-arched bridge over the River Wye dates from the 13th century. Castleton is the centre of production of a semi-precious mineral, Blue John. Eyam village is known for a self-imposed quarantine during the Black Death. Edale is the southern end of the Pennine Way, a 268-mile national trail which traverses most of the Pennines and ends at Kirk Yetholm in the Scottish border. The park also contains the highest village in the United Kingdom, Flash, at . Other villages in the park include Hathersage, Hartington, Ilam and Tideswell.

The towns of Glossop, Chapel-en-le-Frith, Buxton, Macclesfield, Leek, Ashbourne, Matlock and Chesterfield are on the national park&#x27;s fringes. The spa town of Buxton was built up by the Dukes of Devonshire as a genteel health resort in the 18th century while the spa at Matlock Bath, in the River Derwent valley, was popularised in Victorian times. Hayfield is at the foot of Kinder Scout, the area&#x27;s highest summit. Other towns and villages fringing the park include Whaley Bridge, Hadfield, Tintwistle, Darley Dale and Wirksworth in Derbyshire, Stocksbridge in South Yorkshire and Marsden and Holmfirth in West Yorkshire.

===Rivers, reservoirs and canals===

Several rivers have sources on the moorland plateaux of the Dark Peak and the high ridges of the White Peak. Many rivers in the Dark Peak and outer fringes were dammed to create reservoirs for supplying drinking water. Streams were dammed to provide headwater for water driven mills; weirs were built for the same purpose. The reservoirs of the Longdendale Chain were completed in February 1877 to provide compensation water, ensuring a continuous flow in the River Etherow, which was essential for local industry and provided drinking water for Manchester. In a report for the Manchester Corporation, John Frederick Bateman wrote in 1846:

The western Peak District is drained by the Etherow, the Goyt and the Tame, all tributaries of the River Mersey. The north-east is drained by tributaries of the River Don. Of the tributaries of the River Trent draining south and east, the River Derwent is the most prominent. It rises on Bleaklow just east of Glossop and flows through the Upper Derwent Valley, where it is constrained by the Howden, Derwent and Ladybower reservoirs. The reservoirs of the Upper Derwent Valley were built from the early to mid-20th century to supply drinking water to the East Midlands and South Yorkshire.

The rivers Noe and the Wye are tributaries. The River Manifold and River Dove in the south-west, whose sources are on Axe Edge Moor, flow into the Trent. The River Dane flows into the River Weaver in Cheshire.
There are no canals in the national park, although the Standedge Tunnels on the Huddersfield Narrow Canal run underneath the extreme north of it. Outside the park, waters from the Dark Peak feed the Macclesfield, Ashton, and Huddersfield Narrow Canals and waters from the White Peak fed the Cromford Canal. The Peak Forest Canal brought lime from the quarries at Dove Holes for the construction industry. It terminated at Bugsworth Basin and the journey was completed using the Peak Forest Tramway.

The Cromford Canal, from Cromford to the Erewash Canal, served lead mines at Wirksworth and Sir Richard Arkwright&#x27;s cotton mills. The Caldon Canal from Froghall was built to transport limestone from quarries at Cauldon Low for the iron industry and flints for the pottery industry.

===Climate===
Most of the area is over above sea level, in the centre of the country at a latitude of 53°N, bringing relatively high annual rainfall averaging in 1999. The Dark Peak tends to receive more rainfall than the White Peak, as it is higher. The higher rainfall does not affect the temperature, which averages the same as the rest of England and Wales at .

In the 1970s, the Dark Peak regularly had more than 70 days of snowfall. Since then the number has fallen. The hills still see long periods of continuous snow cover in some winters. Snow in mid-December 2009 on some hill summits created some snow patches that lasted until May 2010. In the same winter, the A635 (Saddleworth Moor) and A57 (Snake Pass) were closed due to snow for almost a month. Frost cover is seen for 20–30 per cent of the winter on moorland in the Dark Peak and 10 per cent in the White Peak.

The Moorland Indicators of Climate Change Initiative was set up in 2008 to collect data in the area. Students investigated the interaction between people and the moorlands and their effect on climate change, to discover whether the moorlands are a net carbon sink or source, based on the fact that Britain&#x27;s upland areas contain a major global carbon store in the form of peat. Human interaction in terms of direct erosion and fire, with the effects of global warming, are the main variables they considered.

==Geology==

The Peak District is formed almost wholly of sedimentary rocks of the Carboniferous period. They make up the carboniferous limestone overlying gritstone, and the coal measures that occur only on the margins and infrequent outcrops of igneous rocks, including lavas, tuffs and volcanic vent agglomerates. The general geological structure is that of a broad dome, whose western margins have been intensely faulted and folded. Uplift and erosion have sliced the top off the Derbyshire Dome to reveal a concentric outcrop pattern with coal-measured rocks on the eastern and western margins, carboniferous limestone at the core and rocks of millstone grit between them. The southern edge of the Derbyshire dome is overlain by sandstones of Triassic age, though they barely impinge on the National Park. The White Peak forms a central and southern section with carboniferous limestone found at or near the surface. The Dark Peak to the north, east and west is marked by millstone grit outcrops and broad swathes of moorland.

Earth movements after the Carboniferous period resulted in the up-doming of the area and, particularly in the west, the folding of the rock strata along north–south axes. The region was raised in a north–south line which resulted in the dome-like shape and the shales and sandstones were worn away until limestone was exposed. At the end of this period, the Earth&#x27;s crust sank here which led to the area being covered by sea, depositing a variety of new rocks. Some time after its deposition, mineral veins were formed in the limestone. The veins and rakes have been mined for lead since Roman times.

The Peak District was iced over in at least one of the ice ages of the last two million years, probably the Anglian glaciation of some 450,000 years ago, as shown by patches of glacial till or boulder clay found across the area. It was not iced over in the last glacial period, which peaked about 20,000–22,000 years ago. A mix of Irish Sea and Lake District ice abutted its western margins. Glacial meltwaters eroded a complex of sinuous channels along this margin of the district. Glacial meltwaters contributed to the formation and development of many caves in the limestone area. Remains of wild animal herds roaming the area have been found in several caves.

Various rock-types beneath the soil strongly influence the landscape; they determine the type of vegetation and ultimately the type of animal inhabiting the area. Limestone has fissures and is soluble in water, so that rivers could carve deep, narrow valleys. These often find routes underground, creating cave systems. Millstone grit is insoluble but porous, absorbing water that seeps through the grits, until it meets the less porous shales beneath, creating springs where it reaches the surface. The shales are friable and easily attacked by frost, forming areas vulnerable to landslides, as on Mam Tor.

==Ecology==
The gritstone and shale of the Dark Peak supports heather moorland and blanket bog, with rough sheep pasture and grouse shooting as the main land uses, though parts are also farmed, especially the South West Peak NCA. The limestone plateaus of the White Peak are more intensively farmed, with mainly dairy usage of improved pastures. Woodland forms some 8 per cent of the Peak National Park. Natural broad-leaved woodland appears in the steep dales of the White Peak and cloughs of the Dark Peak. Reservoir margins often have coniferous plantations.

===Flora===
White Peak habitats include calcareous grassland, ash woodlands and rock outcrops for lime-loving species. They include early purple orchid (&quot;Orchis mascula&quot;), dark-red helleborine (&quot;Epipactis atrorubens&quot;) and fly orchid (&quot;Ophrys insectifera&quot;), common rockrose (&quot;Helianthemum nummularium&quot;), spring cinquefoil (&quot;Helianthemum nummularium&quot;) and grass of parnassus (&quot;Parnassia palustris&quot;). Lead rakes, the spoil heaps of ancient mining activity, form another distinctive White Peak habitat, supporting a range of rare metallophyte plants, including spring sandwort (&quot;Minuartia verna&quot;; also known as leadwort), alpine pennycress (&quot;Thlaspi caerulescens&quot;) and mountain pansy (&quot;Viola lutea&quot;).

Two endemic vascular plants are found nowhere else in the world: Derby hawkweed (&quot;Hieracium naviense&quot;), found only in Winnats Pass, is a native perennial of limestone cliffs discovered by J. N. Mills in 1966 and described as a new species in 1968; and leek-coloured hawkweed (&quot;H. subprasinifolium&quot;), which was believed extinct until rediscovered on banks beside the Monsal Trail in Chee Dale in 2017. The endemic Derbyshire feather moss (&quot;Thamnobryum angustifolium&quot;) occurs in one Derbyshire limestone dale, its sole world location intentionally kept confidential; the colony covers about of a rock face with small subsidiary colonies nearby.

Jacob&#x27;s-ladder (&quot;Polemonium caeruleum&quot;), a rarish species characteristic of limestone dales in the White Peak, has been Derbyshire&#x27;s county flower since 2002. It grows on grassland, light woodland, screes and rock ledges, and by streams in Lathkill, Wolfscote, Taddington, Wye Dale and other dales. Pollen evidence from peat bogs shows it was widespread throughout Britain just after the last ice age. Much planted in gardens from where it has established itself in other parts of the area, as a native it is restricted to the White Peak and the Yorkshire Dales.

The Dark Peak heathlands, bogs, gritstone edges and acid grasslands contain relatively few species; heather (&quot;Calluna vulgaris&quot;), crowberry (&quot;Empetrum nigrum&quot;), bilberry (&quot;Vaccinium myrtillus&quot;) and hare&#x27;s-tail cotton grass (&quot;Eriophorum vaginatum&quot;) dominate the high moors. After decades of decline due to pollution, &quot;Sphagnum&quot; mosses are returning, with species such as &quot;S. cuspidatum&quot; particularly dominant.

===Fauna===
====Mammals====
Most Peak District mammals are generalists and widespread across the UK, but the mountain hares on heather moorland in the Dark Peak form the only wild population in England. They were reintroduced in the Victorian era for sporting purposes. A feral population of red-necked wallabies lived around The Roaches from the 1940s onwards, but may now be extinct. Red deer herds, assumed to be derived from animals escaped from deer parks at Lyme Park and Chatsworth, are established in the upper reaches of the Goyt valley and on the moors above Baslow, and a herd on Wharncliffe Crags outside the national park north of Sheffield may derive from hunting stock of Wharncliffe Chase. Biodiversity action plans have been prepared for mountain hare, brown hare, brown long-eared bat, dormouse, harvest mouse, hedgehog, noctule bat, otter, pine marten, polecat, soprano pipistrelle and water vole. The status of the pine marten is unclear, though confirmed sightings have occurred in recent decades in Derbyshire and north Staffordshire and a specimen from an introduced Welsh population was found dead outside the national park on a road between Ripley and Belper in 2018.

====Birds====
As with mammals, many Peak bird species are widespread generalists. The Dark Peak moors still support breeding populations of several upland specialists, such as twite, short-eared owl, golden plover, dunlin, ring ouzel, northern wheatear and merlin. The populations of twite and golden plover are the southernmost confirmed breeding populations in England, and the Peak District Moors Special Protection Area (SPA) is a European designation for its populations of merlin, golden plover and short-eared owl. The Peak District lacks the concentrations of breeding waders found further north in the Pennines, though the moors and their fringes accommodate breeding curlew and lapwing, and less noticeable wading birds such as dunlin and snipe.

Commercial driven grouse shooting occurs on the heather moorlands of the Dark Peak, where the red grouse population is maintained by gamekeepers employed by shooting estates. A population of black grouse became extinct in 2000, but reintroduction was attempted in 2003. Quarries and rock outcrops provide nest sites for peregrine falcon and common raven. Ravens and common buzzards are increasingly found as their British range expands eastwards, perhaps because of general reductions in persecution. Illegal persecution has limited populations of rare raptors such as Eurasian goshawk, peregrine and hen harrier. Following the RSPB&#x27;s publication of &quot;Peak Malpractice&quot;, a 2006 report highlighting wildlife crime, the Peak District Bird of Prey Initiative was set up in 2011 by conservationists and shooting bodies to try to boost populations of birds of prey. The park authorities expressed disappointment at the limited results and the RSPB withdrew from the partnership in January 2018 citing continued efforts by the Moorland Association and National Gamekeepers’ Organisation which together had &quot;frustrated any possibility of progress&quot; on the issue.

Fast-flowing rivers attract specialists such as grey wagtail, dipper, common sandpiper, mandarin duck and goosander. Wooded and semi-wooded areas attract redstart, pied flycatcher, wood warbler and tree pipit, and coniferous plantations house siskin and common crossbill. Upland reservoirs in the Dark Peak are generally oligotrophic and attract few birds, but lower-lying reservoirs on the southern fringes such as Carsington Water and Ogston Reservoir regularly attract rare migrants and wintering rarities such as various waders, wildfowl, gulls and terns. The area is regularly overflown by wintering populations of pink-footed geese moving between East Anglia and Morecambe Bay.

Dipper, golden plover, hen harrier, merlin and short-eared owl are local biodiversity action plan priority species.

Fossil records show that the Peak District was once inhabited by an eclectic mix of species, many of them no longer found in Britain, such as alpine swift, demoiselle crane and long-legged buzzard. Species lost from the Peak District through human activity include hazel grouse, capercaillie and golden eagle.

====Other taxa====
Amphibians and reptiles such as common lizards, grass snakes, great crested newts and slow worms are found in the district. The eastern moors are a stronghold for adders.

Native fish in the Peak District include Atlantic salmon, brown trout, European eel, bullhead, brook lamprey and grayling. A possibly unique population of &quot;wild&quot; rainbow trout survives on the Derbyshire Wye, following their introduction at the turn of the 20th century.

Butterflies in the region include the dingy skipper, brown argus, small blue and white-letter hairstreak. Moths include the anomalous, broom moth, dot moth, garden dart, mouse moth and white ermine. Other invertebrates include the bilberry bumblebee, broad groove-head spider, mole cricket, northern yellow splinter, shining guest ant, violet oil beetle and white-clawed crayfish.

== National Park ==
The Peak District National Park was the first national park to be designated in the United Kingdom, on 17 April 1951 (following the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act of 1949 and a resulting public enquiry to establish its boundary). It was one of ten parks created in the 1950s in the wake of the 1945 Dower Report and 1947 Hobhouse Report, which recommended the creation of national parks in England and Wales. The park has an area of and receives approximately 13 million visitors each year. 90% of the national park is privately owned, with the largest single owner being the National Trust (12%).

The national park is governed by the Peak District National Park Authority, which was established under the 1995 Environment Act, replacing the Peak Park Planning Board. The authority has 30 members, 14 appointed by the Secretary of State for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs and 16 appointed by the local authorities covered by the park. The local authorities and the number of members they appoint are as follows:
==History==

The Peak has been inhabited from the earliest periods of human activity, as shown by finds of Mesolithic flint artefacts and palaeo-environmental evidence from caves in Dovedale and elsewhere. Signs of Neolithic activity include monumental earthworks or barrows such as the one at Margery Hill.

The Bronze Age saw the area well populated and farmed. Evidence remains in henges such as Arbor Low near Youlgreave and the Nine Ladies stone circle at Stanton Moor. In the same period and into the Iron Age, hill forts such as Mam Tor&#x27;s were created. The Romans drew on the area&#x27;s rich mineral veins, exporting lead from the Buxton area along well-used routes. Buxton was a Roman settlement known as &quot;Aquae Arnemetiae&quot; for its spring.

Theories on how the name Peak derived cite the Pecsaetan or peaklanders, an Anglo-Saxon tribe inhabiting the central and northern parts of the area from the 6th century CE, when it belonged to the Anglian kingdom of Mercia. Barrows from the Anglo-Saxon period are present, including Benty Grange, where the eponymous helmet was found.

===Mining and quarrying===

In medieval and early modern times, the area was mainly agricultural, with sheep farming, rather than arable the main activity in upland holdings. From the 16th century, the mineral and geological wealth became increasingly significant. Not only lead, but coal, fluorite, copper from Ecton Mines, zinc, iron, manganese and silver have been mined. Celia Fiennes, describing a journey through the Peak in 1697, wrote of:
Coal measures occur on the Peak&#x27;s western and eastern fringes. Evidence of past workings can be found from Glossop to The Roaches, and from Stocksbridge to Baslow. The coal measures in the east are at the western edge of the South Yorkshire Coalfield. Those in the west are part of the Cheshire section of the Lancashire Coalfield. Mining started in medieval times, was at its most productive in the 18th and early 19th centuries, and continued into the early 20th century. The earliest mining took place around outcrops, where miners followed the seams deeper into the hillsides. At Goyt&#x27;s Moss and Axe Edge, deep seams were worked and steam engines raised the coal and dewatered the mines. Coal from the east was used in lead smelting and from the west for lime burning.

Lead mining peaked in the 17th and 18th centuries; high concentrations were found in the area from this period, along with peat on Kinder Scout, suggesting that lead smelting occurred. Lead mining declined from the mid-19th century, with the last major mine closing in 1939. Lead is a by-product of fluorite, baryte and calcite mining. Bell pits were sunk to access ore that lay close to the surface.

Fluorite or fluorspar is called Blue John locally, its name possibly from the French &quot;bleu et jaune&quot; describing its colour. Blue John is scarce and now only a few hundred kilograms are mined each year for ornamental and lapidary use. The Blue John Cavern in Castleton is a show cave. Small-scale mining takes place in Treak Cliff Cavern.

Industrial limestone quarrying to make soda ash started around Buxton in 1874. In 1926 the operation of the Buxton lime industry became part of ICI. Large-scale limestone and gritstone quarrying flourished as lead mining declined, and is an important if contentious industry. Of the twelve large limestone quarries in operation, Tunstead is one of the largest in Europe. Total limestone output was substantial: at the 1990 peak, 8.5 million tonnes was produced.

===Textiles===
Textiles have been exported for hundreds of years. In the 14th century, the area traded in unprocessed wool. There were several skilled hand spinners and weavers in the area. By the 1780s, Richard Arkwright had developed machinery to produce textiles faster and to a higher standard. The early Arkwright mills were of light construction, narrow, about wide and low, the ceiling height being only and lit by daylight. The new machines were powered by water wheels. The Peak was the ideal location, with its rivers and humid atmosphere. The local pool of labour was quickly exhausted and Litton Mill and Cressbrook Mill in Millers Dale brought in children as young as four from the workhouses of London as apprentices.

As technology advanced, narrow valleys proved unsuited to larger steam-driven mills, but Derbyshire mills remained to trade in finishing and niche products. Glossop benefited from the textile industry. Its economy was tied to a spinning and weaving tradition that evolved from developments in textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution. Until the First World War, Glossop was the headquarters of the largest textile printworks in the world, but after the Wall Street crash its product lines became vulnerable and the industry declined.

===Modern history===
The Kinder Trespass in 1932 was a landmark in the campaign for open access to moorland in Britain and eventually led to the formation of Britain&#x27;s national parks. Before the trespass, open moorland was closed to all. Moorland estates were the private property of landed gentry who used them for only 12 days a year and were guarded by their gamekeepers. The Peak District National Park became the United Kingdom&#x27;s first national park on 17 April 1951. Campaigner Ethel Haythornthwaite played an important part in the development of the national park. The first long-distance footpath in the United Kingdom was the Pennine Way, which opened in 1965 and starts at the Nags Head Inn, in Grindsbook Booth, part of Edale village.

The Peak &amp; Northern Footpaths Society (PNFS) was formed in 1894 to monitor, protect, and improve the footpath network of the Peak District and surrounding areas. The organisation is the oldest existing regional footpath society in the UK.

Saddleworth Moor and Wessenden, above Meltham, gained notoriety after the Moors murders in the 1960s.

==Economy==

Agriculture remains a significant sector for the park. A Park District report stated that in 2019, over 87% of the Peak District was being farmed. Another report, updated in 2023, added this information: &quot;Farming is also one of the largest contributors to the park’s economy employing over 3500 people, which makes up 18.5% of total employment in the national park. That is understandable, since as of 2019, over 87% of the Peak District was being farmed. A State of the Park report indicated that in 2019, &quot;at least 1 in 3 businesses in the Peak District [were] in the agricultural, forestry and fishing industries&quot;.

Tourism in the park and Derbyshire was negatively affected by the pandemic. However, according to a September 2022 report, this sector is a major industry in the &quot;Peak District and Derbyshire, attracting 45 million visitors annually, generating an output of £2.5 billion into the economy and supporting 31,000 jobs. (Data are not available for the park area only.)

Other sources of employment for park residents according to a 2009 report: Manufacturing (19%) and quarrying (12%) are also important. The cement works at Hope is the largest single employer in the park. Limestone is the most important mineral quarried, mainly for roads and cement; shale is extracted for cement at Hope, and several gritstone quarries are worked for building stone. Lead mining is no longer economic, but fluorite, baryte and calcite are extracted from lead veins and small-scale Blue John mining occurs at Castleton.

The springs at Buxton and Ashbourne are exploited for bottled mineral water and many plantations are managed for timber. Other manufacturing includes David Mellor&#x27;s cutlery factory in Hathersage, Ferodo brake linings in Chapel-en-le-Frith and electronic equipment in Castleton.

==Tourism==
&quot;De Mirabilibus Pecci&quot; or &quot;The Seven Wonders of the Peak&quot; by Thomas Hobbes was an early touring description published in 1636. Much scorn was poured on the seven wonders by visitors, including Daniel Defoe, who called the moors by Chatsworth &quot;a waste and houling wilderness&quot; and scorned particularly Peak Cavern near Castleton, known as the &quot;Devil&#x27;s Arse&quot;. Visitor numbers did not rise until the Victorian era, when railways provided access and cultural appreciation of the Picturesque and Romantic developed. John Mawe&#x27;s &quot;Mineralogy of Derbyshire&quot; (1802) and William Adam&#x27;s &quot;Gem of the Peak&quot; (1843) raised interest in the area&#x27;s unique geology.

A tradition of public access and outdoor recreation grew up in what is a natural hinterland and rural escape for the people of industrial Manchester and Sheffield, and remains a valuable resource in a largely post-industrial economy. In a 2005 survey of visitors, 85 per cent of respondents cited &quot;scenery and landscape&quot; as a draw.

===Buxton===

Buxton became a spa through its geothermal spring, which rises at a constant temperature of 28 °C. It was settled by the Romans around 78 CE, then known as Aquae Arnemetiae – the spa of the goddess of the grove. Bess of Hardwick and her husband the Earl of Shrewsbury &quot;took the waters&quot; in 1569, bringing Mary, Queen of Scots there in 1573. The town largely grew in importance in the late 18th century when it was developed by the 5th Duke of Devonshire in style of the spa of Bath.

A resurgence in the 18th century attracted Dr Erasmus Darwin and Josiah Wedgwood, who were drawn by the reputed healing properties of the waters. The railway reached Buxton in 1863.
Buxton&#x27;s notable buildings are The Crescent (1780–1784), modelled by John Carr on Bath&#x27;s Royal Crescent, the Devonshire (1780–1789), the Natural Baths, and the Pump Room by Henry Currey. The Pavilion Gardens opened in 1871. Buxton Opera House was designed by Frank Matcham in 1903.

===Historic buildings===
Historic buildings in the park include Chatsworth House, seat of the Dukes of Devonshire and among Britain&#x27;s finest stately homes; the medieval Haddon Hall, seat of the Dukes of Rutland; and Lyme Park, an Elizabethan manor house transformed by an Italianate front. Other historic buildings in the park include Eyam Hall, Ilam Hall and Tissington Hall. Many villages and towns have fine parish churches, including the 14th-century Church of St John the Baptist at Tideswell, sometimes dubbed the &quot;Cathedral of the Peak&quot;, and the 12th-century Church of St Nicholas at High Bradfield. &#x27;Little John&#x27;s Grave&#x27; is in the churchyard at Hathersage. Peveril Castle, overlooking Castleton, was built by the Normans.

===Museums and attractions===
Inside the park, Eyam Museum has displays on the village&#x27;s history during the Black Death. Castleton has four show caves; Peak Cavern, Blue John, Treak Cliff and Speedwell. In the outer fringes, the area&#x27;s industrial heritage is represented by the mining museum at Matlock Bath, with the Temple Lead Mine, the Derwent Valley Mills World Heritage Site and Brindley Water Mill at Leek. Preserved railways such as the Peak Rail, Ecclesbourne Valley and Churnet Valley lines, the National Tramway Museum at Crich and the Cromford Canal chart the area&#x27;s transport history. Matlock Bath also has the show caves and mines of the Heights of Abraham, which can be reached by cable car, and the Gulliver&#x27;s Kingdom theme park. Buxton has an opera house and theatre, museum and art gallery and Poole&#x27;s Cavern show cave. Other attractions in the fringes include the Alton Towers theme park and the Peak Wildlife Park.

Well dressing ceremonies are held in many villages in the spring and summer months, a tradition said to date from pagan times. Other local customs include Castleton Garland Day and Ashbourne&#x27;s Royal Shrovetide Football, played annually since the 12th century. Buxton hosts two opera festivals, the Buxton Festival and the International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival, and the Buxton Festival Fringe, and the Peak Literary Festival is held at various locations twice a year. Peak District food specialities include the dessert Bakewell pudding, very different from the nationally available Bakewell tart, and the famous cheese Stilton and other local cheeses are produced in the village of Hartington.

===Activities===

An extensive network of public footpaths and long-distance trails of over in total and large open-access areas are available for hillwalking and hiking. The Pennine Way traverses the Dark Peak from Edale to the park&#x27;s northern boundary just south of Standedge. Bridleways are used by mountain bikers, as well as horse riders. The Tissington Trail and High Peak Trail, which reuse former railway lines, are well used by walkers, horse riders and cyclists. The Peak District Boundary Walk is a circular walking trail around the national park.

Several old rail routes were converted into multi-purpose cycle trails. After the Woodhead Line closed between Hadfield and Penistone, some of the trackbed was used for the Longdendale Trail section of the Trans Pennine Trail between Hadfield and Woodhead. The Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway between Rowsley and Buxton contributed to the Monsal Trail. The trackbed of the Cromford and High Peak Railway is open as the High Peak Trail. The Tissington Trail uses another disused rail line between Buxton and Ashbourne, while the Manifold Way follows the old line of the Leek and Manifold Valley Light Railway between Waterhouses and Hulme End.

Local authorities run cycle hire centres at Ashbourne, Parsley Hay, Middleton Top, the Upper Derwent Valley and Hulme End. Wheelchair access is possible at several places on the ex-railway trails, and cycle hire centres offer vehicles adapted to wheelchair users. A project to make footpaths more accessible to less-agile walkers has replaced stiles with gates.
Gritstone outcrops at Stanage Edge and The Roaches, are recognised as some of the finest rock climbing sites in the world. Limestone is more unstable but provides many testing climbs. Thor&#x27;s Cave was explored in the early 1950s by Joe Brown and others. Eleven limestone routes there are listed by the BMC, ranging in grade from Very Severe to E7, and several more have been claimed since the guidebook&#x27;s publication; a few routes are bolted.

Caving takes place in the natural caves, potholes and old mine workings found in the limestone of the White Peak. Peak Cavern, the largest and most important cave system, is even linked to the Speedwell system at Winnats. The largest potholes are Eldon Hole and Nettle Pot. Many old mine workings were often extensions of natural cave systems. They can be found at Castleton, Winnats, Matlock, Stoney Middleton, Eyam, Monyash and Buxton.

Reservoirs such as Torside Reservoir, Damflask Reservoir, Carsington Water and Rudyard Lake are centres for water sports, including sailing, fishing and canoeing. Other activities include air sports such as hang gliding and paragliding, birdwatching, fell running, off-roading, and orienteering.

==Transport==
===Roads===
The first roads constructed by the Romans may have followed existing tracks. The Roman network linked the settlements and forts of Aquae Arnemetiae (Buxton), Chesterfield, Ardotalia (Glossop), Navio (Brough and Shatton) and beyond. Parts of the modern A515 and A53 roads, south of Buxton, are believed to follow the routes of Roman roads.

Packhorse routes crossed the Peak in the Middle Ages and some paved causeways, such as the Long Causeway along Stanage Edge, date from that period. No highways appear on Christopher Saxton&#x27;s 1579 map of Derbyshire. Bridge-building improved the transport network.

Journey times fell with the introduction of turnpike roads from 1731, but the ride from Sheffield to Manchester in 1800 still took 16 hours, prompting Samuel Taylor Coleridge to remark that &quot;a tortoise could outgallop us!&quot; From about 1815, better quality turnpike roads were built. The Snake Pass, part of the A57, was built under the direction of Thomas Telford between 1819 and 1821.

The main roads in the Peak District are:
* The A57 between Sheffield and Manchester;
* The A628, &quot;Woodhead Pass&quot;, between Barnsley and Manchester, via Longdendale;
* The A6 from Derby to Manchester via Buxton;
* The &quot;Cat and Fiddle Road&quot; from Macclesfield to Buxton; and
* In the north, the A635 from Manchester to Barnsley.

Roads and lanes are often congested and parking is problematic in towns and villages, especially in summer. A congestion charge was proposed in 2005, but was rejected.

===Waterways===
Cromford Canal opened in 1794 to carry coal, lead and iron ore to the Erewash Canal. It closed in 1944. The canals and turnpike roads had to compete with the railways after 1825.

===Railways===
The first railway, the Cromford and High Peak Railway from High Peak Junction to Whaley Bridge, was an industrial line. Passenger services followed, including the Woodhead Line (Sheffield to Manchester, via Longdendale) and the Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway. Several railways succumbed to the Beeching Axe in the 1960s, including passenger services on the Woodhead line. Freight services continued until the line was finally closed in 1981; much of the route has been converted to shared-use paths on the Trans Pennine Trail.

Passenger train services currently operate along the following lines:
* The Hope Valley line between Sheffield, New Mills Central and Manchester Piccadilly, stopping at stations including Hathersage, Hope and Edale;
* The Derwent Valley line between Derby and Matlock;
* The Buxton line between Manchester Piccadilly, Stockport and Buxton;
* The Glossop line, linking Glossop and Hadfield with Manchester Piccadilly, along the remaining stub of the Woodhead line;
* The Huddersfield line from Manchester to Huddersfield, via Marsden.

===Buses and coaches===
Coach services provide access to Matlock, Bakewell and Buxton from Derby, Nottingham and Manchester through TransPeak and National Express.

There are regular buses from Sheffield, Glossop, Stoke, Leek and Chesterfield.

In rural areas, minibuses operate from towns to smaller villages.

===Air===
The nearest airports are Manchester and East Midlands.

===Cycling===
Cycle England invested £1.25 million in building and improving cycle routes in the national park for leisure and commuting.

==Conservation issues==

The proximity of the Peak to conurbations and urban areas (some 20 million people live within an hour&#x27;s drive) poses challenges for the area. The park authority, National Trust and other landowners try to keep the upland landscape accessible for recreation while protecting it from intensive farming, erosion and visitor pressures. Tension exists between the needs of conservation, of 38,000 residents, and of millions who visit.

The uneven distribution of visits creates stresses. Dovedale alone receives about two million visitors a year. Other much visited areas include Bakewell, Castleton and the Hope Valley, Chatsworth, Hartington and the reservoirs of the Upper Derwent Valley. Over 60 per cent of visits occur between May and September, with Sunday the busiest day.

Footpath users in the more popular walking areas have contributed to serious erosion problems, particularly on the fragile peat moorlands. The use of some paths by mountain bikers is believed to have exacerbated the problem. Measures to contain the damage include diversion of the official route of the Pennine Way out of Edale, which now goes via Jacob&#x27;s Ladder rather than following the Grindsbrook, and surfacing moorland footpaths with expensive natural stone. Some rights of way have been damaged by legal and illegal use by off-road vehicles such as 4×4s and trail bikes. Campaigners have sought to reduce their impact.

Large-scale limestone quarrying is contentious. Most mineral extraction licences were issued by national government for 90 years in the 1950s and remain legally binding. The park authority has a policy of considering applications for new quarries and licence renewal in the park in terms of the local and national need for the mineral and how unique the source is, in conjunction with the effects on traffic, residents and the environment. Some licences have not been renewed; the RMC Aggregates quarry at Eldon Hill closed in 1999 and was landscaped. Proposals from Stancliffe Stone Ltd to reopen dormant gritstone quarries at Stanton Moor in 1999 became a test case, contested by ecological protesters and residents on the grounds that this would threaten Bronze Age remains at the Nine Ladies Stone Circle and damage the natural landscape. In 2007, negotiations took place to relocate the development to Dale View quarry in a less sensitive area.

Starting in the 1990s, there has been an intensification in management of the upland moors for driven grouse shooting. This has involved an increase in the use of rotational burning and predator control. Both practices can be controversial and have led to calls for greater controls over the activities of moorland owners. The Birds of Prey Initiative has worked to link conservation groups with landowners, to improve the prospects for predatory birds in the Peak District. This has led to improvement in the numbers of breeding birds of prey, but overall numbers remain low. The RSPB withdrew support for the scheme in 2018, citing the continued and illegal persecution of raptors by commercial grouse shooting estates, represented within the Initiative by the Moorland Association and National Gamekeepers&#x27; Organisation.

The grasslands of the White Peak plateau have been improved for intensive farm and food production. The result has been that most of this grassland is of little value to nature conservation, often with only one grass species present. The best areas that remain are the steep sides of limestone valleys. These have international importance, but are fragmented, which makes them vulnerable to loss. Biodiversity within Britain&#x27;s national parks has generally fared no better than that in the wider countryside, with similar rates of decline in species numbers. One reason may be that their powers are directed primarily at preventing intrusive development to protect the aesthetic and historic appearance of the park, rather than at land management.

The upland moors of the south Pennines suffered some of the worst ecological degradation of any extensive habitat in the UK. This is due mainly to a history of industrial pollution from neighbouring towns during the industrial revolution, worsened by wild fires and erosion. Work to restore this habitat got underway in the 21st century. While progress has been made, there is more to do to make it a sustainable, functioning ecosystem. The significance of the habitat degradation is compounded by its being a source of atmospheric carbon dioxide that contributes to climate change through global warming.

==In literature and arts==
The landscapes of the Peak have inspired writers for centuries. Various places have been identified by Ralph Elliott and others as locations in the 14th-century poem &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot;; Lud&#x27;s Church is thought to be the Green Chapel.
Key scenes in Jane Austen&#x27;s 1813 novel &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; are set in the Peak. &quot;Peveril of the Peak&quot; (1823) by Sir Walter Scott is a historical novel set at Peveril Castle, Castleton, in the reign of Charles II. William Wordsworth was a frequent visitor to Matlock; the Peak inspired several of his poems, including an 1830 sonnet to Chatsworth House. The village of Morton in Charlotte Brontë&#x27;s 1847 novel &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is based on Hathersage, where Brontë stayed in 1845; Thornfield Hall may have been inspired by nearby North Lees Hall. Snowfield in George Eliot&#x27;s novel &quot;Adam Bede&quot; (1859) is thought to be based on Wirksworth, where her uncle managed a mill; Ellastone (as Hayslope) and Ashbourne (as Oakbourne) also feature.

Beatrix Potter, author of Peter Rabbit, visited her uncle Edmund Potter at his printworks in Dinting Vale. She copied cloth samples from his pattern book for her characters. Mrs Tiggywinkle&#x27;s shawl, in The Tale of Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle, is based on pattern number 222714.

Children&#x27;s author Alison Uttley (1884–1976) was born at Cromford; her novel &quot;A Traveller in Time&quot;, set in Dethick, recounts the Babington Plot to free Mary, Queen of Scots, from imprisonment. Crichton Porteous (1901–1991) set several books in Peak locations; &quot;Toad Hole&quot;, &quot;Lucky Columbell&quot; and &quot;Broken River&quot; take place in the Derwent Valley. Geraldine Brooks&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Year of Wonders&quot; (2001), blends fact and fiction in the story of the plague village of Eyam. Eyam also inspired &quot;Children of Winter&quot; by children&#x27;s novelist Berlie Doherty, who has set several other works in the Peak, including &quot;Deep Secret&quot;, based on the drowning of the villages of Derwent and Ashopton by the Ladybower Reservoir, and &quot;Blue John&quot;, inspired by the cavern at Castleton.

Many works of crime and horror have been set in the Peak. &quot;The Terror of Blue John Gap&quot; by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1859–1930) recounts terrible events at the Blue John mines. Sherlock Holmes investigates the kidnapping of a child in &quot;The Adventure of the Priory School&quot;. Many horror stories by local author Robert Murray Gilchrist feature Peak settings. Stephen Booth has set a crime-fiction series in real and imagined Peak locations, while &quot;In Pursuit of the Proper Sinner&quot;, an Inspector Lynley mystery by Elizabeth George, is set on the fictional Calder Moor. Another local author who sets crime novels there is Sarah Ward.

Other writers and poets who lived in or visited the Peak include Samuel Johnson, William Congreve, Anna Seward, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Lord Byron, Thomas Moore, Richard Furness, D. H. Lawrence, Vera Brittain, Richmal Crompton and Nat Gould. The landscapes and historic houses are popular settings for film and television. The classic 1955 film &quot;The Dam Busters&quot; was filmed at the Upper Derwent Valley reservoirs, where practice flights for the bombing raids on the Ruhr dams had been made during the Second World War.

In adaptations of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, Longnor has featured as Lambton, and Lyme Park and Chatsworth House have stood in for Pemberley. Haddon Hall doubled as Thornfield Hall in two adaptations of &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; and has appeared in several films, including &quot;Elizabeth&quot;, &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; and &quot;The Other Boleyn Girl&quot;. The television medical drama &quot;Peak Practice&quot; set in the fictional village of Cardale was filmed in Crich, Matlock and other Peak locations. The world&#x27;s longest-running sitcom, &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot;, was filmed in Holmfirth and the surrounding Holme Valley. The psychological thriller &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Shoes&quot; was filmed in 2003 in and around Matlock, Bonsall, Darley Dale, Tansley and Riber, and featured Riber Castle.

<doc id="55133" wikidata="Q702189" url="?curid=55133" title="Treaty of Niš (1739)">
<text>The Treaty of Niš was a peace treaty signed on 3 October 1739 in Niš (nowadays in Serbia), by the Ottoman Empire and Russian Empire, to end the Russo-Turkish War of 1735–1739. It was preceded by the preliminary Russo-Turkish peace treaty, signed through French mediation on 18 September 1739 in Belgrade, while the peace arrangements were finalized bu the treaty of Niš on 3 October.

By the Treaty of Niš, the Russians gave up their claim to Crimea and Moldavia but were allowed to build a port at Azov, though without fortifications and without the right to have a fleet in the Black Sea. The war was the result of a Russian effort to gain Azov and Crimea as a first step towards dominating the Black Sea. The Habsburg monarchy entered the war in 1737 on the Russian side, but was forced to make peace with Ottomans at the separate Treaty of Belgrade, surrendering central Serbia, northern Bosnia and Oltenia (the Banat of Craiova), and allowing the Ottomans to resist the Russian push toward Constantinople. In return, the Sultan acknowledged the Habsburg Emperor as the official protector of all Ottoman Christian subjects (&quot;see Ottoman millet&quot;), a position also claimed by Russia. The Austrian peace treaty, coupled with the imminent threat of Swedish invasion, compelled Russia to accept peace at Niš.

<doc id="55134" wikidata="Q7354790" url="?curid=55134" title="Rock climbing in the Peak District">
<text>Rock climbing is a popular activity in the Peak District; particularly on edges such as Stanage or Froggatt. Generally the climbing style is free climbing (as opposed to aid climbing) and the rock is either gritstone or limestone. Climbing has been practised in the Peak District since the late 19th century; James W. Puttrell is generally credited with starting the sport. The first climbing guidebook to the area was &quot;Some Gritstone Climbs&quot;, by John Laycock, published in 1913.
There are over 10,000 routes in the Peak District.
One of the most famous Peak District climbers, and a pioneer of many new routes, is Ron Fawcett. The climb known as &quot;Master&#x27;s Edge&quot;, on Millstone Edge, near Hathersage, is a testament to his skill and strength. The climb is graded E7 6c and rises 19m up the near vertical edge.

<doc id="55138" wikidata="Q115081" url="?curid=55138" title="Lewis County, New York">
<text>Lewis County is a county located in the U.S. state of New York. As of the 2020 census, the population was 26,582, making it the fourth-least populous county in New York. Its county seat is Lowville. The county is named after Morgan Lewis, the Governor of New York when the county was established. The county is part of the North Country region of the state.

==History==
The area now occupied by Lewis County was very sparsely occupied until the end of the 18th century. Although the land was already claimed by the Province of New York in its original grant, the land was clearly part of the territory of the Iroquois confederacy until after the American Revolutionary War, when New York seized the lands from tribes that had supported the British. The lands were unsurveyed and remained unattractive to settlement until after the complex process of Macomb&#x27;s Purchase of 1791 eventually put much of the land in the hands of John Brown.

===Jurisdiction history===
The area now falling in the jurisdiction of Lewis County, New York, has changed jurisdiction many times, beginning as part of the originally enormous Albany County in 1683, then, after one of the many times that Albany County was divided, becoming part of Tryon County in 1772, which was renamed to Montgomery County in 1784; next, present-day Lewis County was part of Herkimer County in 1791, then part of Oneida County in 1798, and finally assumed its current name and borders in 1805.

When counties were established in New York State in 1683, the present Lewis County was part of Albany County. This was an enormous county, including the northern part of New York State as well as all of the present State of Vermont and, in theory, extending westward to the Pacific Ocean. This county was reduced in size on July 3, 1766, by the creation of Cumberland County, and further on March 16, 1770, by the creation of Gloucester County, both containing territory now in Vermont.

On March 12, 1772, what was left of Albany County was split into three parts, one remaining under the name Albany County. One of the other pieces, Tryon County, contained the western portion (and thus, since no western boundary was specified, theoretically still extended west to the Pacific). The eastern boundary of Tryon County was approximately five miles west of the present city of Schenectady, and the county included the western part of the Adirondack Mountains and the area west of the West Branch of the Delaware River. The area then designated as Tryon County now includes 37 counties of New York State. The county was named for William Tryon, colonial governor of New York.

In the years prior to 1776, most of the Loyalists in Tryon County fled to Canada. In 1784, following the peace treaty that ended the American Revolutionary War, the name of Tryon County was changed to Montgomery County to honor the general, Richard Montgomery, who had captured several places in Canada and died attempting to capture the city of Quebec, replacing the name of the despised British governor.

In 1789, the size of Montgomery County was reduced by the splitting off of Ontario County from Montgomery. The actual area split off from Montgomery County was much larger than the present county, also including the present Allegany, Cattaraugus, Chautauqua, Erie, Genesee, Livingston, Monroe, Niagara, Orleans, Steuben, Wyoming, Yates, and part of Schuyler and Wayne Counties.

In 1791, Herkimer County was one of three counties split off from Montgomery (the other two being Otsego, and Tioga County). This was much larger than the present county, however, and was reduced by a number of subsequent splits. The first one of these, in 1794, produced Onondaga County. This county was larger than the current Onondaga County, including the present Cayuga, Cortland, and part of Oswego Counties.

Oneida County (as well as a part of Chenango County), was split off from Herkimer County in 1798.

Lewis County was split off from Oneida County in 1805.

===Military history===
On April 11, 1805, the Militia of Lewis, Jefferson and St Lawrence was established by the Council of Appointment under General Walter Martin. This was known as the 26th Brigade, aka Martin&#x27;s Brigade.

350 men of the 26th Brigade were detached but never deployed in response to an Act of Congress dated March 30, 1808, in response to the English troubles.

On June 15, 1808, the 1st Regiment was established under Lieutenant Luke Winchell, consisting of troops from Lowville, Denmark, Harrisburg and Pinckney. A cavalry troop was formed in 1809 under Captain Levi Collins.

On April 10, 1812, in anticipation of war, the President of the United States was authorized to call up men for military service. To that end, a company was drafted for three months, under Captain Lyman Deming, of Denmark, in the regiment of Colonel Christopher P. Bellinger, of German Flats. They served at Sackett&#x27;s Harbor from May 12, 1812, to August 21, 1812, when they were discharged.

When the War of 1812 began on June 12, 1812, the above company was in the field, participating in the First Battle of Sacket&#x27;s Harbor. To supply them, a company of 72 men were called up on June 23, 1812, under Captain Nathan Cook and placed under Colonel Thomas B Benedict of DeKalb.

County wide drafts were issued in March 1813, September 1813, July 1814 and October 1814 in support of the war effort.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (1.2%) is water.

Lewis County is located in northwestern New York State, slightly east of due north from Syracuse. The eastern part of the county is in the Adirondack Park. A good portion of the Tug Hill Plateau is in the western part of the county, putting Lewis County in the heart of the Snowbelt. The county is home to the Black River Valley.

<text>Livingston County is a county in the U.S. state of New York. As of the 2020 census, the population was 61,834. Its county seat is Geneseo. The county is named after Robert R. Livingston, who helped draft the Declaration of Independence and negotiated the Louisiana Purchase. The county is part of the Finger Lakes region of the state.

Livingston County is part of the Rochester Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
On February 23, 1821, Livingston County, New York was formed from Ontario and Genesee Counties. The twelve original towns were: Avon, Caledonia, Conesus, Geneseo (county seat), Groveland, Leicester, Lima, Livonia, Mount Morris, Sparta, Springwater, and York.

Part of North Dansville was annexed from Steuben County in 1822 and became a separate town when Sparta was divided in 1846. At the same time, the town of West Sparta was also formed from Sparta. The towns of Nunda and Portage were annexed in 1846 and the town of Ossian was annexed in 1857 from Allegany County.

Avon, Williamsburgh, and the hamlet of Lakeville competed for the honor of becoming the Livingston County seat, but the distinction was bestowed upon Geneseo, the principal village and center of commerce. The Wadsworths donated a suitable lot, beautifully situated at the north end of the village. The brick courthouse faced Main Street, the jail of wood construction was built directly west, and a one-story cobblestone building for the County Clerk&#x27;s office was built east of the courthouse. Until construction was completed in 1823, court was held in the upper story of the district school on Center Street (east of the present-day Livingston County Museum) and prisoners were housed in Canandaigua. In 1829 the county opened a poor house farm just outside the village.

=== Livingston County Flag ===

The County Flag was adopted in 1971 for the county&#x27;s 150th anniversary. The significance of the colors and design relates to features and history of the county:

Yellow – the golden grain of the northern towns;

Blue – the Genesee River;

Green – the forests in the southern towns;

White – salt and limestone, prominent minerals in the county;

Balance and crossed quills – in honor of New York&#x27;s first Chancellor Robert R. Livingston, for whom the county was named.

== Senecas and Pioneer history ==
The Seneca Nation of Indians, once the most numerous and powerful of the Six Nations of the Iroquois, were called the &quot;Keepers of the Western Door&quot; because they guarded the western boundaries of the Haudenosaunee territory, which included the lands around Seneca Lake west to Lake Erie. Many of the principal towns were in the fertile Genesee Valley, part of what is now Livingston County. Little Beard&#x27;s Town, or Genesee Castle, located near present-day Cuylerville in the Town of Leicester, was one of the largest.

=== Sullivan Campaign of the Revolutionary War ===
In 1779, General George Washington ordered General John Sullivan to organize the largest American offensive movement of the Revolutionary War to displace the Iroquois and gain control of New York&#x27;s western frontier. Sullivan&#x27;s army of approximately 5000 men trekked into the heart of the Seneca territory with orders to destroy all settlements.

On September 13, 1779, hundreds of Indians and Loyalists ambushed roughly 25 of Sullivan&#x27;s scouts on a hill overlooking Conesus Lake at a site now known as the Ambuscade in the town of Groveland. At least 16 Americans were massacred including an Oneida guide. Scout leader Lt. Thomas Boyd and Sgt. Michael Parker were captured and their mutilated remains were discovered a day later when the army reached Little Beard&#x27;s Town in Cuylerville, a hamlet in the town of Leicester. This site was the largest Indian settlement in western New York and the western limit of the Sullivan Campaign. Sullivan&#x27;s army found the village deserted as most of the Indians and Loyalists had retreated west to Fort Niagara to avoid confrontation.

The army buried Boyd and Parker then burned the village and thousands of surrounding acres of crops. Upon retreat, the army discovered the bodies of the soldiers of Lt. Boyd&#x27;s scouting party at the Ambuscade and buried them with military honors.

After fulfilling General Washington&#x27;s instructions to destroy more than 40 Indian settlements and food supplies throughout the Finger Lakes, Sullivan&#x27;s army returned to Easton, Pennsylvania. The mission was considered successful and helped to lessen the threat to white settlers across the state. 

The enthusiasm generated by soldiers of General Sullivan&#x27;s army prompted the rapid development of the Genesee Valley and the area that now comprises Livingston County. Within five years following the Treaty of Paris in 1783, ending the Revolutionary War, colonists branched out from well-established settlements in New England and the Mid-Atlantic states, with visions of reaping the benefits this vast wilderness land had to offer. News of the beauty and fertility of the area spread as far as Western Europe.

=== Seneca treaties ===
The destruction of the Iroquois villages during the Sullivan Campaign greatly impoverished the Senecas but did not deprive them of title to the land. This led to the creation of a series of treaties in order to facilitate westward expansion of white settlers. These treaties were not all supported by the Iroquois and consequently forever altered their culture.

After the Treaty of Paris, Messrs. Phelps and Gorham purchased from Massachusetts the rights to approximately eight million acres west of what is referred to as the old Pre-emption Line. The two men negotiated a treaty with the Seneca which was intended to extinguish Indian claims to this land. Approximately two-thirds of present-day Livingston County was covered by this treaty.

In 1790, Phelps and Gorham sold about 1,200,000 acres to Robert Morris, known as the &quot;financier of the American Revolution.&quot; Morris then sold the land to a company of English capitalists, with Sir William Pulteney obtaining the majority interest. Charles Williamson, agent for Pulteney, took an absolute conveyance of the &quot;Genesee Tract.&quot; The first permanent white settlement he established was the small village Williamburgh in Groveland at the confluence of the Genesee River and the Canaserega Creek. The village prospered until 1806 before it was abandoned.

The remainder of the original purchase was bought by Samuel Ogden in 1791 for Robert Morris, who then sold most of it to the Holland Land Company, reserving 500,000 acres, known as the Morris Reserve. By the terms of the sale, Morris obligated himself to extinguish the Indian title to the land sold. However, his involvement in land speculation left him penniless and imprisoned for debt for several years.

The 1794 Treaty of Canandaigua recognized the sovereignty of the Six Nations and restored their title to lands in western New York. But as pressure by western developers increased, the Treaty of Big Tree in 1797 was negotiated in the Wadsworth brothers&#x27; log cabin in Geneseo. This treaty included the western one-third of Livingston County and extinguished Indian title to practically all the lands west to the Niagara Frontier, excepting a handful of Indian reservations.

=== The Pioneer Wadsworths ===
Col. Jeremiah Wadsworth of Hartford, Connecticut, one of the wealthiest and most influential men in the post-Revolutionary War era, invested heavily in land speculation in this region. In 1788, he made the arduous trip to the Genesee country to judge its worth and finding it unimaginably rich. After purchasing more than 200,000 acres (50 square miles) along the Genesee River, Col. Wadsworth offered his young cousins, brothers James and William Wadsworth, 2000 acres of prime farmland in and around what is now Geneseo. In return, they represented the Colonel&#x27;s interests by establishing a home farm (known as the Homestead) and promoting settlement and progress.

The Wadsworth brothers acquired thousands more acres, becoming the largest single landowners in western New York. They leased the majority of the land to tenant farmers with generous lease agreements. James and William were known far and wide for their philanthropy and innovative farming methods. The legacy of James and William Wadsworth and their vast land holdings has been carried forward generation after generation and the prominent family still remains synonymous with the Genesee Valley to present day.

=== Genesee Valley Canal ===
The opening of the Erie Canal in 1825 brought prosperity across the state and realization of the benefits of internal navigation. The Genesee Valley lacked access to broader markets other than via the Genesee River, often too dangerous to navigate. Planners envisioned a lateral canal, cutting through the core of Livingston County, as the means of uniting the Erie Canal with the Allegany River, thereby connecting the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers, allowing freight and passenger transportation all the way to New Orleans.

Construction of the Genesee Valley Canal started in Rochester in 1837, reaching Mount Morris by 1840. A junction to Sonyea opened in 1841 and then a branch was built to Dansville, completing 52 miles. Extending the canal through to Nunda and Portage was most challenging, as workers battled the area&#x27;s most rugged terrain along the Genesee River gorge. After years of delays, 17 locks between Nunda and Portageville were completed in 1851.

By the time that the last segment connecting to the Allegany River was finally finished in 1862, however, railroad technology had outpaced canals. This forced the Genesee Valley Canal to close by 1878; the towpath became the bed of the Genesee Valley Canal Railroad. Railroads rapidly became the primary mode of transportation as they criss-crossed the entire county. Although the Genesee Valley Canal was short-lived, the lasting effect expanded job opportunities for thousands of new immigrants, opened markets for the area&#x27;s abundant goods, and overall enriched the quality of life for residents.

Today, the old Genesee Valley Canal Railroad bed has become part of the Genesee Valley Greenway Trail.

== Important sites and events ==

=== Genesee Wesleyan Seminary, Lima ===
One of the first coeducational schools in the country, incorporated 1834, founded by the Genesee Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church and operated until 1941. Genesee College, founded on the same site in the 1840s, eventually relocated and became Syracuse University. Presently the site is occupied by Elim Bible Institute.

=== Water Therapy: Avon Springs and the Jackson Sanitarium ===

The area around present-day Avon and eastern Caledonia was known by the Seneca as &quot;Canawaugus,&quot; or &quot;the place of stinking waters&quot; due to the prevalence of sulfur in the springs on the west side of town. The Seneca believed the water&#x27;s mineral characteristics had health benefits long before the white settlers arrived. In 1821, Richard Wadsworth was the first white man in Avon to build a showering box and promote the curative properties of the sulfur water. The reputation of Avon Springs grew throughout the 19th century, peaking just before the Civil War era. Guests sought health cures as well as relaxation and recreation opportunities in the Genesee Valley. By about 1900, most of the numerous hotels and spas were gone.

Nunda and Dansville also boasted mineral springs and attracted travelers from around the world to enjoy the medicinal effects of water therapy. Most well-known was the sprawling resort in Dansville operated by Dr. James C. Jackson, a leading holistic health advocate and abolitionist. Dr. Jackson is credited with inventing Granula, America&#x27;s first cold breakfast cereal, and along with Dr. Harriet Austen, endorsed exercise and less constraining clothes for women. The resort stayed in the Jackson family until the early 1900s. During World War I, the sanitarium was used by the federal government as a hospital for wounded soldiers. In 1929, bodybuilder Bernarr Macfadden bought the facility and named it the Physical Culture Hotel. His larger-than-life personality and national magazine with the same name boosted the popularity of the place into the 1950s.

=== The Shakers of Groveland ===
The only Shaker colony in western New York began moving from Sodus, Wayne County, New York to the hamlet of Sonyea in Groveland in 1836. The Shakers practiced celibacy, agrarian communal living, and self-sufficiency.

The Groveland site was convenient as a stopping place for Shakers traveling between their western societies in Ohio and their parent village at New Lebanon, New York. The 1,700-acre farm, with its fertile flatlands and the access to the Genesee Valley Canal benefited the Shakers’ cottage industries. They made flat brooms, dried apples, dried sweet corn, and fancy goods such as sewing boxes.

Groveland&#x27;s Shaker population peaked with 148 members in 1836. In 1857, they had 130 members, which shrank to 57 in 1874. Shaker membership everywhere had diminished to the point where the society had to begin consolidating its population at fewer sites. In 1892, the remaining 34 Groveland members moved to the North Family of the Shaker community at Watervliet, New York.

After the Shakers left Groveland, State of New York paid the Shakers $115,000 for the buildings and 1,800 acres of land at Groveland, for the Craig Colony for Epileptics.

Several diaries and journals from the Shakers&#x27; early years at Groveland can be found at the Western Reserve Historical Society, Cleveland, Ohio. These manuscripts are also available on microfilm at more than 20 locations throughout the U.S.

=== Civil War regiments ===
Three Civil War regiments were organized in Livingston County. The 104th New York Volunteer Infantry or ‘Wadsworth Guards’, named in honor of Gen. James S. Wadsworth, formed September 1861 at Geneseo. The camp was located at the head of North Street in the village and known as Camp Union. The two other regiments were organized at Portage near present-day Letchworth State Park. In 1862, the 130th Infantry regiment formed and later converted to a cavalry unit known as the 1st New York Dragoons. The same year the 136th Infantry Regiment, also known as the ‘Ironclads’, was organized.

=== The Caledonia Fish Hatchery ===
Rochester native Seth Green&#x27;s groundbreaking experiments in artificial fish propagation led to the establishment of the first fish hatchery in the Western Hemisphere in Caledonia in 1864. The hatchery is managed by the Department of Conservation and has remained active into the 21st century.

=== Genesee Valley Hunt ===
The Livingston County Hunt was established in 1876 by Maj. William Austin Wadsworth. By the early 1880s, the organization was called the Genesee Valley Hunt and the Valley became known as the fox-hunting center of North America. The Genesee Valley Hunt remains active and is one of the oldest in the U.S.

=== Salt mining ===
Salt was discovered more than 1000 feet below the surface in Livingston County in the early 1880s. Salt mines opened in the towns of Leicester (Cuylerville), Livonia, Mount Morris, and York (Retsof). The Retsof mine became the largest salt-producing mine in the United States and the second largest in the world. The industry was a major employer throughout most of the 20th century until the mine collapsed and flooded in 1994. American Rock Salt opened a new mine in 1997 at Hampton Corners in the Town of Groveland and soon afterwards became the largest operating salt mine in the U.S.

=== Murray Hill, Mt. Morris ===
Once the terrestrial lands of the Seneca Indians, a wide area in Western New York known as the Mt. Morris Tract was purchased in 1807 by four couples – Mr. and Mrs. John R. Murray Sr., Mr. and Mrs. William Ogden, Mr. and Mrs. John Trumbull, all of New York City, and Mr. and Mrs. James Wadsworth of Geneseo.

In 1837, the land was subdivided and John R. Murray Jr. established a home on the property that would be known as &quot;Murray Hill.&quot; He brought his bride, Anna Vernon Olyphant of New York City, to live in a simple but elegant mansion overlooking the Genesee Valley. The couple improved the grounds with formal gardens and Fish Ponds and entertained distinguished guests for the next 25 years.

Over the course of the next seven decades, the estate had a succession of proprietors. In 1882, while under the ownership of Col. Charles Shepard and wife, a fire completely destroyed the Murray mansion. A new, less magnificent home was built together with extensive barns and stables.

By 1930, New York State was seeking a site in the area for one of three new tuberculosis sanatoriums to help control and prevent a disease that was the cause of nearly 4000 deaths in upstate New York that year. Although Livingston County had a low rate of tuberculosis as compared to urban centers, the Murray Hill site was chosen as the ideal spot for this facility to serve the western region due to its central location, favorable weather, easy accessibility to rail lines and state roads, and proximity to advanced healthcare centers at Craig Colony in Sonyea and Strong Hospital in Rochester. All of these factors, including the restorative nature of the surroundings and the strong community support, added to the desirability and were pivotal factors in Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s final decision to build a hospital on this site in 1932.

Construction of the 200-bed facility was completed and it opened in 1936. In addition, the campus complex included residences for staff and physicians, an auditorium, greenhouse, power plant and laundry. A separate children&#x27;s 50-bed ward was constructed and opened the following year. Over the course of the next 35 years, the tuberculosis hospital served patients who often spent several months recuperating. Preventative efforts and advances in the use of antibiotics impacted the spread of tuberculosis and resulted in the closing of the hospital by the state in 1971.

Livingston County acquired the site and bordering park lands for $1.00 in 1972, using the main hospital building as a skilled nursing facility until 2004 when it was determined that a more modern facility was required. The adjacent Center for Nursing and Rehabilitation was built to accommodate the growing needs of the area and the other buildings on the campus now house various county departments and agencies.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (1.3%) is water.

Livingston County is located in the Finger Lakes region, south of Rochester and east of Buffalo.

Letchworth State Park is partly in the western part of the county. The Genesee River flows northward through the county.

The Rochester and Southern Railroad (RSR) traverses the county from Greigsville south through Mount Morris to Dansville.

==Government and politics==
Livingston County is heavily Republican. 1964 was the only time in history that Livingston County voted for the Democratic presidential candidate. Aside from 1964, Livingston County has voted Republican in every presidential election since the Republican Party&#x27;s founding in 1854.

<text>Madison County is a county located in the U.S. state of New York. As of the 2020 census, the population was 68,016. Its county seat is Wampsville. The county is named after James Madison, the fourth president of the United States, and was first formed in 1806. The county is part of the Central New York region of the state.

Madison County is part of the Syracuse metropolitan area, and is home to both the International Boxing Hall of Fame and the National Abolition Hall of Fame and Museum.

==History==

Indigenous peoples had occupied areas around Oneida Lake for thousands of years. The historic Oneida Indian Nation is an Iroquoian-speaking people who emerged as a culture in this area about the fourteenth century and dominated the territory. They are one of the Five Nations who originally comprised the Iroquois Confederacy or &quot;Haudenosaunee&quot;.

English colonists established counties in eastern present-day New York State in 1683; at the time, the territory of the present Madison County was considered part of Albany County, with the city of Albany located on the Hudson River. This was an enormous county, including the northern part of New York State around Albany as well as all of the present State of Vermont and, in theory, extending westward to the Pacific Ocean. It was claimed by the English but largely occupied by the Oneida, Onondaga, Seneca, Cayuga and Mohawk, who had the territory in the central Mohawk Valley, as well as Mahican near the Hudson River. On July 3, 1766, the English organized Cumberland County, and on March 16, 1770, they organized Gloucester County, both containing territory now included in the state of Vermont.

On March 12, 1772, what was left of Albany County was split into three parts, one remaining under the name Albany County. One of the other pieces, Tryon County, contained the western portion (and thus, since no western boundary was specified, theoretically still extended west to the Pacific). The eastern boundary of Tryon County was approximately five miles west of the present city of Schenectady, and the county included the western part of the Adirondack Mountains and the area west of the West Branch of the Delaware River. The area then designated as Tryon County includes 37 current counties of New York State. The county was named for William Tryon, the colonial governor of New York.

In the years prior to the outbreak of revolution in 1776, tensions rose in the frontier areas upstate and most of the Loyalists in Tryon County fled to Canada. In 1784, following the peace treaty that ended the American Revolutionary War, New York changed the name of Tryon County to Montgomery County, in honor of the general, Richard Montgomery, who had captured several places in Canada and died attempting to capture the city of Quebec.

As allies of the Patriots, the Oneida Indian Nation was allocated land by the United States in the postwar settlement for a reservation near Oneida Lake, in their traditional homeland. In the postwar treaty, the four Iroquois nations who had been allies of the British were forced to cede their lands; most of their peoples had already migrated to Canada to escape the worst of the fighting on the frontier after Sullivan&#x27;s Raid. This expedition through Indian country had destroyed dwellings, crops and winter stores; many Iroquois who did not migrate died of starvation that winter.

But settlers were hungry for land, and in 1788 Governor Clinton&#x27;s representatives persuaded the Oneida to cede some of their territory to the state for sale to European-American settlers. This was called the &quot;Clinton Purchase&quot;, after Governor George Clinton. The land comprised the southern portion of the Oneida reservation. It has also been called the Twenty Townships, as these were the number organized after New York controlled the land.

As this sale was never ratified by the United States Senate, it was declared unconstitutional in a ruling by the United States Supreme Court in the late twentieth century. New York State had no legal authority after the Revolution and the formation of the United States to negotiate separately with American Indian tribes.

In 1789, Montgomery County was reduced in size by the splitting off of Ontario County. This was later divided to form the present Allegany, Cattaraugus, Chautauqua, Erie, Genesee, Livingston, Monroe, Niagara, Orleans, Steuben, Wyoming, Yates, and part of Schuyler and Wayne counties.

In 1791, Herkimer and Tioga counties were two of three counties split off from Montgomery County (the other being Otsego County).

Chenango County was formed in 1798 from parts of Tioga and Herkimer counties. Finally, Madison County was created from Chenango County in 1806.

About 1802, the Oneida agreed to allocate about 22,000 acres of their land to the Stockbridge and Munsee (Lenape), who were seeking refuge from anti-Native American conflicts by American settlers after the Revolution. Both were Christianized: the Stockbridge had migrated from western Massachusetts and the Lenape from New York and New Jersey. The two peoples were pressured to leave New York for Wisconsin in the 1820s, to make more land available for European-American settlement.

In the late twentieth century, the three recognized Oneida tribes: of Wisconsin, New York, and the Thames reserve in Canada, filed suit in a land claim against New York for its treaty and forced purchase of their ancestral lands after the American Revolutionary War, seeking the return of thousands of acres. The Supreme Court of the United States has ruled the purchase was unconstitutional, as New York did not have the treaty ratified by the United States Senate, and had no authority under the U.S. Constitution to deal directly with the Oneida, a right reserved to the federal government. In 2010 the state offered the Oneida Tribe of Wisconsin more than 300 acres in Sullivan County in the Catskill Mountains, with permission to construct a gambling casino, and two acres in Madison County, to settle their part of the suit. Several private and public interests oppose the deal, including other federally recognized tribes in New York.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (1.0%) is water.

Madison County is located in central New York State, just east of Syracuse, north of Binghamton, and slightly north of due west from Albany. Madison County contains the geographic center of the state at Pratts Hollow in the Town of Eaton.

Oneida Lake and Oneida Creek define part of the northern boundary. The Great Swamp, formerly located south of the lake, was a rich wetlands habitat important to many species of birds and wildlife. This was drained by local and state construction projects in the early decades of the twentieth century, chiefly by Italian immigrants. The fertile soil supported high production of onions and other commodity crops, and the Italian families grew wealthy from their work. The area was known as &quot;Black Beach&quot; for its mucklands. Chittenango Creek defines much of the western boundary.

=== Adjacent counties and areas ===
Chenango County is across the southern border. Onondaga and Cortland counties form the western border, with Onondaga serving as Madison County&#x27;s longest and most prominent border. Otsego County forms a short boundary in the southeastern corner of Madison County. Oneida County shares a northeastern border with Madison County. Oneida Lake is the northern border with part of Oswego County on the opposite shore.

==Politics==
For the majority of its history, Madison County has been a mostly Republican county, with the party&#x27;s presidential candidates winning the county in every election but one from 1884 to 1992. The one exception to this was in 1964, as the county swung strongly to the Democratic column for the first time thanks to Barry Goldwater&#x27;s conservatism alienating the Northeast, giving Lyndon B. Johnson a wide margin of victory as he won every county in the state and won by a landslide nationally. As New York has turned into a solid blue state, the county has become a swing county and national bellwether from 1996 onward. However, the margins of victory for the two parties in recent elections have been quite different. The three most recent Republican victories in the county have all been by over 10 percentage points, while the three most recent Democratic wins have all been by margins of under 600 votes.

<text>Monroe County is a county in the U.S. state of New York, located along Lake Ontario&#x27;s southern shore. As of 2022, the population was 752,035, according to Census Bureau estimates. Its county seat and largest city is Rochester. The county is named after James Monroe, the fifth president of the United States. Monroe County is part of the Rochester, NY Metropolitan Statistical Area. The county is part of the Finger Lakes region of the state.

==History==

When counties were established in the Province of New York in 1683, the present Monroe County was part of Albany County. This was an enormous county, including the northern part of the State of New York as well as all of the present State of Vermont and, in theory, extending westward to the Pacific Ocean. This county was reduced in size on July 3, 1766, by the creation of Cumberland County, and further on March 16, 1770, by the creation of Gloucester County, both containing territory now in Vermont.

On March 12, 1772, what was left of Albany County was split into three parts, one remaining under the name Albany County. One of the other pieces, Tryon County, contained the western portion (and thus, since no western boundary was specified, theoretically still extended west to the Pacific). The eastern boundary of Tryon County was approximately five miles west of the present city of Schenectady, and the county included the western part of the Adirondack Mountains and the area west of the West Branch of the Delaware River. The area then designated as Tryon County now includes 37 counties of the State of New York. The county was named for William Tryon, colonial governor of New York.

In the years prior to 1776, most of the Loyalists in Tryon County fled to Canada. In 1784, following the peace treaty that ended the American Revolutionary War, the name of Tryon County was changed to Montgomery County in order to honor the general, Richard Montgomery, who had captured several places in Canada and died attempting to capture the city of Quebec, replacing the name of the hated British governor.

In 1789, Ontario County was split off from Montgomery. The actual area split off from Montgomery County was much larger than the present county, also including the present Allegany, Cattaraugus, Chautauqua, Erie, Genesee, Livingston, Monroe, Niagara, Orleans, Steuben, Wyoming, Yates, and part of Schuyler and Wayne counties.

Genesee County was created by a splitting of Ontario County in 1802. This was much larger than the present Genesee County, however. It contained the present Allegany, Cattaraugus, Chautauqua, Erie, Niagara, Orleans, Wyoming, and portions of Livingston and Monroe counties.

Finally, Monroe County was formed from parts of Genesee and Ontario counties in 1821.
==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county&#x27;s total area is , of which is land and (52%) is water.

Monroe County is in Western State of New York&#x27;s northern tier, northeast of Buffalo and northwest of Syracuse. The northern county line is also the state line and the border of the United States, marked by Lake Ontario. Monroe County is north of the Finger Lakes.

==Government and politics==
Monroe County was chartered as a municipal corporation by the New York State Legislature in 1892 and rechartered under New York&#x27;s Municipal Home Rule Law in 1965.

From 1856 to 1932, Monroe County voters voted for the Republican candidate in every presidential election apart from 1912. Democratic candidate Woodrow Wilson was able to win the county in 1912 when the Republican vote was divided between then incumbent president William Howard Taft and former president Theodore Roosevelt. Monroe County voted for incumbent Democratic presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt (1936, 1940, 1944) and Harry S. Truman (1948). From 1952 to 1976, Monroe County voted for the Republican candidate in all presidential elections except for Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s Democratic landslide in 1964. In 1980, incumbent Democratic president Jimmy Carter won Monroe County, despite having lost in the county to Republican Gerald Ford in 1976. Monroe County went back to voting Republican in 1984 and 1988, but has voted for the Democratic presidential candidate every time from 1992 onwards, up to and including the 2024 election.

In recent years, the urban area&#x27;s traditional partisan dynamic appears to have begun shifting in the Democratic Party&#x27;s favor at the local level. A Democrat won the 2017 race for county sheriff for the first time in decades, in 2019 Democrat Adam Bello was elected county executive after over 30 years of Republican control, in 2020 democrats Samra Brouk and Jeremy Cooney flipped state senate districts long held by the GOP, and the traditionally Republican county legislature is now split 16-13 in favor of the Democratic Party. This matches a broader national trend of increased Democratic success in suburban areas.

===Executive branch===
The county&#x27;s executive branch is headed by the county executive, Adam Bello. The executive&#x27;s office is on the first floor of the county office building on West Main Street in Rochester. The county clerk is Jamie Romeo, a Democrat.
The county was exclusively governed by a board of supervisors for the first 114 years of its history. In 1935, the position of county manager, appointed by the board, was approved by popular referendum. In 1983, the position was replaced by a county executive, directly elected by popular vote, with expanded powers (e.g., veto). In 1993, the legislature enacted term limits for the executive office of 12 consecutive years to start in 1996.
====Sheriff====
The Monroe County Sheriff&#x27;s office (MCSO) provides law enforcement and has the constitutional authority to operate the county jail and provide civil functions. As with most counties in New York, the MCSO also performs a range of police services and provides physical and operational security to the courts. The MCSO is led by a sheriff who is elected by the residents of Monroe County, serving a 4-year term. The sheriff is considered the highest police official in the county, followed by an appointed undersheriff and subordinate chief deputy. The Monroe County Sheriff is Todd K. Baxter, a Democrat.

Organizationally, the office is composed of numerous bureaus, each responsible for a given scope of functional operations. The jail bureau is the largest component of the sheriff&#x27;s office, overseeing an inmate population of around 1,000. Under the New York State Constitution, the sheriff is the warden of the county jail.

The police bureau of the sheriff&#x27;s office operates a sizable road patrol force which serves municipalities within Monroe County that do not independently enforce traffic. They are also responsible for primary police patrols at the Greater Rochester International Airport and parks throughout the county. Deputies assigned to the marine unit patrol the coastline of Lake Ontario as well as Irondequoit Bay. The police bureau further employs a mounted unit, bomb squad, SWAT team, hostage recovery, criminal investigations, scuba, and canine units. The court security bureau provides security at the Hall of Justice as well as at the state appellate court building.

In 2011, the uniforms were named the 2011 Public Safety Uniform Award in the County Sheriff&#x27;s/Police Department category by the North American Association of Uniform Manufacturers and Distributors (NAUMD).

===Legislative branch===
The county&#x27;s legislative branch consists of a 29-member county legislature which replaced the earlier 43-member board of supervisors on January 1, 1967. Members meet in the legislative chambers on the fourth floor of the county office building. All 29 members of the legislature are elected from districts. There are 16 Democrats and 13 Republicans. The president of the legislature is Yversha Román, a Democrat. In 1993, the legislature enacted term limits of 10 consecutive years to start in 1996. Legislators can return to the office after not being in the legislature for a term. Since the enacting of term limits, as of 2024 four legislators (Stephanie Aldersley, Karla Boyce, Calvin Lee, Jr., and Robert Colby) returned after previously leaving due to the term limit; Boyce was reelected again three times; Lee and Colby were appointed to fill vacancies before subsequently being reelected themselves; and Aldersley was appointed before being defeated for reelection.

===Judicial branch===
* Monroe County Court
* Monroe County Family Court, for matters involving children
* Monroe County Surrogates Court, for matters involving the deceased

Monroe County is also home to regional businesses such as Wegmans, Roberts Communications, Inc., Holding Corp., and major fashion label Hickey Freeman.

===High technology===

Tech Valley, the technologically recognized area of eastern New York State, has spawned a western offshoot into the Rochester, Monroe County, and Finger Lakes areas of New York State. Since the 2000s, as the more established companies in Rochester downsized, the economy of Rochester and Monroe County has been redirected toward high technology, with new, smaller companies providing the seed capital necessary for business foundation. The Rochester and Monroe County area is important in the field of photographic processing and imaging as well as incubating an increasingly diverse high technology sphere encompassing STEM fields, in part the result of private startup enterprises collaborating with major academic institutions, including the University of Rochester and Cornell University. Given the high prevalence of imaging and optical science among the industry and the universities, Rochester is known as the world capital of imaging. The Institute of Optics of the University of Rochester and the Rochester Institute of Technology in nearby Henrietta both have imaging programs.

===Major employers===
Several industries occupy a major portion of the jobs located regionally, with health care comprising a significant portion of jobs in Monroe County. The University of Rochester (including its numerous hospitals) is the largest employer regionally with over 27,000 workers; Rochester Regional Health (parent company of Rochester General and Unity hospitals) is the second largest consisting of over 15,000. Wegmans is third with about 13,000 local employees.

<text>Ontario County is a county in the U.S. state of New York. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 112,458. The county seat is Canandaigua. The county is part of the Finger Lakes region of the state.

Ontario County is part of the Rochester, New York metropolitan area.

In 2006, &quot;Progressive Farmer&quot; rated Ontario County as the &quot;Best Place to Live&quot; in the U.S., for its &quot;great schools, low crime, excellent health care&quot; and its proximity to Rochester.

==History==
This area was long controlled by the Seneca people, one of the Five Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy, or &quot;Haudenosaunee&quot;. They were forced to cede most of their land to the United States after the American Revolutionary War.

When the English established counties in New York Province in 1683, they designated Albany County as including all the northern part of New York State, the present State of Vermont, and, in theory, extending westward to the Pacific Ocean. On July 3, 1766 Cumberland County was organized, and on March 16, 1770 Gloucester County was founded, both containing territory now included in the state of Vermont. The English claims were their assertion; the Five and then Six Nations of the Iroquois occupied and controlled most of the territory in central and western New York until after the Revolutionary War.

As New York was more heavily settled in the 18th century, the colonial government organized additional counties, but European settlement did not proceed very far west past Little Falls, New York, about halfway through the Mohawk Valley, until after the revolutionary war. This area was ostensibly part of Montgomery County, renamed after the war for an American officer. Seth Read, a Colonel in the Battle of Bunker Hill, moved here with his family as a pioneer between 1787 and 1795. See also Geneva (town), New York.

Land-hungry settlers from New England swept into upstate and western New York after the Revolution, as nearly five million acres of new lands were available for purchase since the Iroquois were forced to cede most of their territories to the United States. Four tribes had allied with the British and were mostly resettled in Canada: the Mohawk, Onondaga, Seneca and Cayuga.

Transfer of what is now Ontario County to New York formally took effect in 1789, when native title was extinguished, and the county was formally established to govern the lands of the Phelps and Gorham Purchase the year prior. The territory first organized as Ontario County was much larger than at present and ran south from the shore of Lake Ontario. As the area was settled, new counties were organized. The following counties were rapidly organized from this territory in the first decades after the war: Allegany, Cattaraugus, Chautauqua, Erie, Genesee, Livingston, Monroe, Niagara, Orleans, Steuben, Wyoming, and Yates counties, and parts of Schuyler and Wayne counties.

In 1796, Ontario County was divided and Steuben County was organized. In 1802, Ontario County was reduced when Genesee County was split off. The new county was originally very large, including the present Allegany, Cattaraugus, Chautauqua, Erie, Niagara, Orleans and Wyoming Counties and parts of Livingston and Monroe counties.

In 1821, portions of Genesee County were combined with portions of Ontario County to create Livingston and Monroe counties.

In 1823, a portion of Seneca County was combined with a portion of Ontario County to create Wayne County. The same year, a portion of Steuben County was combined with a portion of Ontario County to create Yates County.

==Great Awakening==
This frontier area was part of the evangelistic activities during the Second Great Awakening of the early 19th century, when Baptist, Methodist and Congregational preachers traveled and organized revivals and camp meetings. In addition, independent sects developed in central and western New York during this period, including the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, the Shakers and the Universal Friends.

===Latter Day Saint movement===

Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, lived in Manchester in the 1820s on the border with Palmyra. Several events in the early history of the movement occurred in Ontario County. Hill Cumorah in Manchester is where Smith said he discovered the Golden plates said to contain the writings later known as the &quot;Book of Mormon&quot;. Smith visited the hill each year on the fall equinox (September 22) between 1823 and 1827, and claimed to be instructed by the Angel Moroni. Smith said he was finally permitted to take the record on September 22, 1827. He published the &quot;Book of Mormon&quot; in Palmyra in 1830. The hill (which was then unnamed) is on the main road toward Canandaigua from Palmyra to Manchester (modern State Route 21); it was a few miles from Joseph Smith&#x27;s home.

Since the 1930s the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has held the Hill Cumorah Pageant annually here. It regularly attracts thousands to its performances. The church also maintains a visitors&#x27; center at the hill, the Palmyra New York Temple, and the former Smith property and homes. The latter property straddles the border between Ontario and Wayne counties.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (2.8%) is water.

==Government and politics==














The county is governed by an elected &quot;Board of Supervisors&quot;, and uses the &quot;Board-Administrator&quot; system, hiring a professional County Administrator. The Board of Supervisors has twenty-one members: one is elected from each Town, two from the city of Canandaigua and three from the city of Geneva. As of 2004, the county government has over 800 full-time employees (augmented by another 360 seasonal or available part-time workers), and a budget of $136 million.

The county is similar in its politics to much of the rest of rural upstate New York; its voters have tended to support Republican presidential candidates ever since that party was formed, and before that they supported the Whig Party.

However, beginning in the 1990s, the Democratic Party began to improve its performance in Ontario County thanks to the growth of Rochester&#x27;s outer suburbs in areas such as Victor and Farmington. In 1996, Ontario County voted for the Democratic presidential candidate for the first time since 1964 and only the second time since the Whig Party contested its first presidential election in 1836. In 2008, John McCain narrowly edged a victory over Barack Obama by less than one percent, and in 2012 Obama narrowly lost the county to Republican nominee Mitt Romney by a margin of 1.5 percent. In 2016, Republican nominee Donald Trump of New York City won the county by 7.3 percent over Democratic nominee and former United States Secretary of State / former Senator from New York Hillary Clinton of Chappaqua, New York. In 2020, Democrat Joe Biden came incredibly close to winning the county, losing to Trump by just 33 votes.

===State and federal government===

<doc id="55167" wikidata="Q161955" url="?curid=55167" title="André Breton">
<text>André Robert Breton (; ; 19 February 1896 – 28 September 1966) was a French writer and poet, the co-founder, leader, and principal theorist of surrealism. His writings include the first &quot;Surrealist Manifesto&quot; (&quot;Manifeste du surréalisme&quot;) of 1924, in which he defined surrealism as &quot;pure psychic automatism&quot;.

Along with his role as leader of the surrealist movement he is the author of celebrated books such as &quot;Nadja&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;Amour fou&quot;. Those activities, combined with his critical and theoretical work on writing and the plastic arts, made André Breton a major figure in twentieth-century French art and literature.

==Biography==
André Breton was the only son born to a family of modest means in Tinchebray (Orne) in Normandy, France. His father, Louis-Justin Breton, was a policeman and atheist, and his mother, Marguerite-Marie-Eugénie Le Gouguès, was a former seamstress. Breton attended medical school, where he developed a particular interest in mental illness. His education was interrupted when he was conscripted for World War I.

During World War I, he worked in a neurological ward in Nantes, where he met the Alfred Jarry devotee Jacques Vaché, whose anti-social attitude and disdain for established artistic tradition influenced Breton considerably. Vaché committed suicide when aged 23, and his war-time letters to Breton and others were published in a volume entitled &quot;Lettres de guerre&quot; (1919), for which Breton wrote four introductory essays.

Breton married his first wife, Simone Kahn, on 15 September 1921. The couple relocated to rue Fontaine 42 in Paris on 1 January 1922. The apartment on rue Fontaine (in the Pigalle district) became home to Breton&#x27;s collection of more than 5,300 items: modern paintings, drawings, sculptures, photographs, books, art catalogs, journals, manuscripts, and works of popular and Oceanic art. Like his father, he was an atheist.

===From Dada to Surrealism===
Breton launched the review &quot;Littérature&quot; in 1919, with Louis Aragon and Philippe Soupault. He also associated with Dadaist Tristan Tzara.

In &quot;Les Champs Magnétiques&quot; (&quot;The Magnetic Fields&quot;), a collaboration with Soupault, he implemented the principle of automatic writing. With the publication of his &quot;Surrealist Manifesto&quot; in 1924 came the founding of the magazine &quot;La Révolution surréaliste&quot; and the Bureau of Surrealist Research. A group of writers became associated with him: Soupault, Louis Aragon, Paul Éluard, René Crevel, Michel Leiris, Benjamin Péret, Antonin Artaud, and Robert Desnos.

Eager to combine the themes of personal transformation found in the works of Arthur Rimbaud with the politics of Karl Marx, Breton and others joined the French Communist Party in 1927, from which he was expelled in 1933. &quot;Nadja&quot;, a novel about his imaginative encounter with a woman who later becomes mentally ill, was published in 1928. Due to the economic depression, he had to sell his art collection and rebuilt it later.

In December 1929, Breton published the &quot;Second manifeste du surréalisme&quot; (&quot;Second manifesto of surrealism&quot;), which contained an oft-quoted declaration for which many, including Albert Camus, reproached Breton: &quot;The simplest surrealist act consists, with revolvers in hand, of descending into the street and shooting at random, as much as possible, into the crowd&quot;.

In reaction to the &quot;Second manifesto&quot;, writers and artists published in 1930 a collective collection of pamphlets against Breton, entitled (in allusion to an earlier title by Breton) &quot;Un Cadavre&quot;. The authors were members of the surrealist movement who were insulted by Breton or had otherwise opposed his leadership. The pamphlet criticized Breton&#x27;s oversight and influence over the movement. It marked a divide amidst the early surrealists. Georges Limbour and Georges Ribemont-Dessaignes commented on the sentence where shooting at random in the crowd is described as the simplest surrealist act. Limbour saw in it an example of buffoonery and shamelessness and Ribemont-Dessaignes called Breton a hypocrite, a cop and a priest.

After the publication of this pamphlet against Breton, the &quot;Manifesto&quot; had a second edition, where Breton added in a note: &quot;While I say that this act is the simplest, it is clear that my intention is not to recommend it to all merely by virtue of its simplicity; to quarrel with me on this subject is much like a bourgeois asking any non-conformist why he does not commit suicide, or asking a revolutionary why he hasn&#x27;t moved to the USSR&quot;.

In 1935, there was a conflict between Breton and the Soviet writer and journalist Ilya Ehrenburg during the first International Congress of Writers for the Defense of Culture, which opened in Paris in June. Breton had been insulted by Ehrenburg — along with all fellow surrealists — in a pamphlet which said, among other things, that surrealists shunned work, favouring parasitism, and that they endorsed &quot;onanism, pederasty, fetishism, exhibitionism, and even sodomy&quot;. Breton slapped Ehrenburg several times on the street, which resulted in surrealists being expelled from the Congress. René Crevel, who according to Salvador Dalí was &quot;the only serious communist among surrealists&quot;, was isolated from Breton and other surrealists, who were unhappy with Crevel because of his bisexuality and annoyed with communists in general.

In 1938, Breton accepted a cultural commission from the French government to travel to Mexico. After a conference at the National Autonomous University of Mexico about surrealism, Breton stated after getting lost in Mexico City (as no one was waiting for him at the airport) &quot;I don&#x27;t know why I came here. Mexico is the most surrealist country in the world.&quot;

However, visiting Mexico provided the opportunity to meet Leon Trotsky. Breton and other surrealists traveled via a long boat ride from Patzcuaro to the town of Erongarícuaro. Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo were among the visitors to the hidden community of intellectuals and artists. Together, Breton and Trotsky wrote the &quot;Manifesto for an Independent Revolutionary Art&quot; (published under the names of Breton and Diego Rivera) calling for &quot;complete freedom of art&quot;, which was becoming increasingly difficult with the world situation of the time.

===World War II and exile===
Breton was again in the medical corps of the French Army at the start of World War II. The Vichy government banned his writings as &quot;the very negation of the national revolution&quot; and Breton escaped, with the help of the American Varian Fry and Hiram &quot;Harry&quot; Bingham IV, to the United States and the Caribbean during 1941. He emigrated to New York City and lived there for a few years. In 1942, Breton organized a groundbreaking surrealist exhibition at Yale University.

In 1942, Breton collaborated with artist Wifredo Lam on the publication of Breton&#x27;s poem &quot;Fata Morgana&quot;, which was illustrated by Lam.

Breton got to know Martinican writers Suzanne Césaire and Aimé Césaire, and later composed the introduction to the 1947 edition of Aimé Césaire&#x27;s &quot;Cahier d&#x27;un retour au pays natal&quot;. During his exile in New York City he met Elisa Bindhoff, the Chilean woman who would become his third wife.

In 1944, he and Elisa traveled to the Gaspé Peninsula in Québec, where he wrote &quot;Arcane 17&quot;, a book which expresses his fears of World War II, describes the marvels of the Percé Rock and the extreme northeastern part of North America, and celebrates his new romance with Elisa.

During his visit to Haiti in 1945–46, he sought to connect surrealist politics and automatist practices with the legacies of the Haitian Revolution and the ritual practices of Vodou possession. Recent developments in Haitian painting were central to his efforts, as can be seen from a comment that Breton left in the visitors&#x27; book at the Centre d&#x27;Art in Port-au-Prince: &quot;Haitian painting will drink the blood of the phoenix. And, with the epaulets of [Jean-Jacques] Dessalines, it will ventilate the world.&quot; Breton was specifically referring to the work of painter and Vodou priest Hector Hyppolite, whom he identified as the first artist to directly depict Vodou scenes and the lwa (Vodou deities), as opposed to hiding them in chromolithographs of Catholic saints or invoking them through impermanent vevé (abstracted forms drawn with powder during rituals). Breton&#x27;s writings on Hyppolite were undeniably central to the artist&#x27;s international status from the late 1940s on, but the surrealist readily admitted that his understanding of Hyppolite&#x27;s art was inhibited by their lack of a common language. Returning to France with multiple paintings by Hyppolite, Breton integrated this artwork into the increased surrealist focus on the occult, myth, and magic.

Breton&#x27;s sojourn in Haiti coincided with the overthrow of the country&#x27;s president, Élie Lescot, by a radical protest movement. Breton&#x27;s visit was warmly received by &quot;La Ruche&quot;, a youth journal of revolutionary art and politics, which in January 1946 published a talk given by Breton alongside a commentary which Breton described as having &quot;an insurrectional tone&quot;. The issue concerned was suppressed by the government, sparking a student strike, and two days later, a general strike: Lescot was toppled a few days later. Among the figures associated with both &quot;La Ruche&quot; and the instigation of the revolt were the painter and photographer Gérald Bloncourt and the writers René Depestre and Jacques Stephen Alexis. In subsequent interviews Breton downplayed his personal role in the unrest, stressing that &quot;the misery, and thus, the patience of the Haitian people, were at the breaking point&quot; at the time and stating that &quot;it would be absurd to say that I alone incited the fall of the government&quot;. Michael Löwy has argued that the lectures that Breton gave during his time in Haiti resonated with the youth associated with &quot;La Ruche&quot; and the student movement, resulting in them &quot;plac(ing) them as a banner on their journal&quot; and &quot;t(aking) hold of them as they would a weapon&quot;. Löwy has identified three themes in Breton&#x27;s talks which he believes would have struck a particular chord with the audience, namely surrealism&#x27;s faith in youth, Haiti&#x27;s revolutionary heritage, and a quote from Jacques Roumain extolling the revolutionary potential of the Haitian masses.

===Later life===

Breton returned to Paris in 1946, where he opposed French colonialism (for example as a signatory of the &quot;Manifesto of the 121&quot; against the Algerian War) and continued, until his death, to foster a second group of surrealists in the form of expositions or reviews (&quot;La Brèche&quot;, 1961–65). In 1959, he organized an exhibit in Paris.

Breton consistently supported the francophone Anarchist Federation and he continued to offer his solidarity after the Platformists around founder and Secretary General Georges Fontenis transformed the FA into the Fédération communiste libertaire (FCL).

André Breton died at the age of 70 in 1966, and was buried in the Cimetière des Batignolles in Paris.

==Legacy==
===Breton as a collector===
Breton was an avid collector of art, ethnographic material, and unusual trinkets. He was particularly interested in materials from the northwest coast of North America. During a financial crisis he experienced in 1931, most of his collection (along with that of his friend Paul Éluard) was auctioned. He subsequently rebuilt the collection in his studio and home at 42 rue Fontaine. The collection grew to over 5,300 items: modern paintings, drawings, sculptures, photographs, books, art catalogs, journals, manuscripts, and works of popular and Oceanic art.

French anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss endorsed Breton&#x27;s skill in authentication based on their time together in 1940s New York.

After Breton&#x27;s death on 28 September 1966, his third wife, Elisa, and his daughter, Aube, allowed students and researchers access to his archive and collection. After thirty-six years, when attempts to establish a surrealist foundation to protect the collection were opposed, the collection was auctioned by Calmels Cohen at Drouot-Richelieu. A wall of the apartment is preserved at the Centre Georges Pompidou.

Nine previously partly unpublished manuscripts, including the &quot;Manifeste du surréalisme&quot;, were auctioned by Sotheby&#x27;s in May 2008.

== Personal life ==
Breton married three times:

* from 1921 to 1931, to Simone Collinet, &quot;née&quot; Kahn (1897–1980);
* from 1934 to 1943, to Jacqueline Lamba, with whom he had his only child, a daughter, ;
* from 1945 to 1966 (his death), to Elisa Bindhoff Enet.

<doc id="55169" wikidata="Q305" url="?curid=55169" title="Corporal punishment">
<text>A corporal punishment or a physical punishment is a punishment which is intended to cause physical pain to a person. When it is inflicted on minors, especially in home and school settings, its methods may include spanking or paddling. When it is inflicted on adults, it may be inflicted on prisoners and slaves, and can involve methods such as whipping with a belt or a horsewhip.

Physical punishments for crimes or injuries, including floggings, brandings and even mutilations, were practised in most civilizations since ancient times. They have increasingly been viewed as inhumane since the development of humanitarianism ideals after the Enlightenment, especially in the Western world. By the late 20th century, corporal punishment was eliminated from the legal systems of most developed countries.

The legality of corporal punishment in various settings differs by jurisdiction. Internationally, the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries saw the application of human rights law to the question of corporal punishment in a number of contexts:
* &quot;Corporal punishment in the home&quot;, the punishment of children by parents or other adult guardians, is legal in most of the world. As of 2023, 65 countries, mostly in Europe and Latin America, have banned the practice.
* &quot;School corporal punishment&quot;, of students by teachers or school administrators, such as caning or paddling, has been banned in many countries, including Canada, Kenya, South Africa, New Zealand and all of Europe. It remains legal, if increasingly less common, in some states of the United States and in some countries in Africa and Southeast Asia.
* &quot;Judicial corporal punishment&quot;, such as whipping or caning, as part of a criminal sentence ordered by a court of law, has long disappeared from most European countries. As of 2021, it remains lawful in parts of Africa, Asia, the Anglophone Caribbean and indigenous communities in several countries of South America.
* &quot;Prison corporal punishment&quot; or &quot;disciplinary corporal punishment&quot;, ordered by prison authorities or carried out directly by correctional officers against the inmates for misconduct in custody, has long been common practice in penal institutions worldwide. It has officially been banned in most Western civilizations during the 20th century, but is still employed in many other countries today. Punishments such as paddling, foot whipping or different forms of flagellation have been commonplace methods of corporal punishment within prisons. This was also common practice in the Australian penal colonies and prison camps of the Nazi regime in Germany.
* Military corporal punishment is or was allowed in some settings in a few jurisdictions.

In many Western countries, medical and human rights organizations oppose the corporal punishment of children. Campaigns against corporal punishment have aimed to bring about legal reforms in order to ban the use of corporal punishment against minors in homes and schools.

==History==
===Prehistory===
Author Jared Diamond writes that hunter-gatherer societies have tended to use little corporal punishment whereas agricultural and industrial societies tend to use progressively more of it. Diamond suggests this may be because hunter-gatherers tend to have few valuable physical possessions, and misbehavior of the child would not cause harm to others&#x27; property.

Researchers who have lived among the Parakanã and Ju/&#x27;hoansi people, as well as some Aboriginal Australians, have written about the absence of the physical punishment of children in those cultures.

Wilson writes:

===Antiquity===

In the Western world, the corporal punishment of children has traditionally been used by adults in authority roles. Beating one&#x27;s son as a form of punishment is even recommended in the book of Proverbs:

Robert McCole Wilson argues that, &quot;Probably this attitude comes, at least in part, from the desire in the patriarchal society for the elder to maintain his authority, where that authority was the main agent for social stability. But these are the words that not only justified the use of physical punishment on children for over a thousand years in Christian communities, but ordered it to be used. The words were accepted with but few exceptions; it is only in the last two hundred years that there has been a growing body of opinion that differed. Curiously, the gentleness of Christ towards children (Mark, X) was usually ignored&quot;.

Corporal punishment was practised in Egypt, China, Greece, and Rome in order to maintain judicial and educational discipline. Disfigured Egyptian criminals were exiled to Tjaru and Rhinocorura on the Sinai border, a region whose name meant &quot;cut-off noses.&quot; Corporal punishment was prescribed in ancient Israel, but it was limited to 40 lashes. In China, some criminals were also disfigured but other criminals were tattooed. Some states gained a reputation for their cruel use of such punishments; Sparta, in particular, used them as part of a disciplinary regime which was designed to increase willpower and physical strength. Although the Spartan example was extreme, corporal punishment was possibly the most frequent type of punishment. In the Roman Empire, the maximum penalty which a Roman citizen could receive under the law was 40 &quot;lashes&quot; or 40 &quot;strokes&quot; with a whip which was applied to the back and shoulders, or 40 lashes or strokes with the &quot;fasces&quot; (similar to a birch rod, but consisting of 8–10 lengths of willow rather than birch) which were applied to the buttocks. Such punishments could draw blood, and they were frequently inflicted in public.

Quintilian ( – ) voiced some opposition to the use of corporal punishment. According to Wilson, &quot;probably no more lucid indictment of it has been made in the succeeding two thousand years&quot;.

Plutarch, also in the first century, writes:

===Middle Ages===
In Medieval Europe, the Byzantine Empire blinded and removed the noses of some criminals and rival emperors. Their belief that the emperor should be physically ideal meant that such disfigurement notionally disqualified the recipient from office. (The second reign of Justinian the Slit-nosed was the notable exception.) Elsewhere, corporal punishment was encouraged by the attitudes of the Catholic church towards the human body, flagellation being a common means of self-discipline. This had an influence on the use of corporal punishment in schools, as educational establishments were closely attached to the church during this period. Nevertheless, corporal punishment was not used uncritically; as early as the 11th century Saint Anselm, Archbishop of Canterbury was speaking out against what he saw as the excessive use of corporal punishment in the treatment of children.

===Modernity===
From the 16th century onwards, new trends were seen in corporal punishment. Judicial punishments were increasingly turned into public spectacles, with public beatings of criminals intended as a deterrent to other would-be offenders. Meanwhile, early writers on education, such as Roger Ascham, complained of the arbitrary manner in which children were punished.

Peter Newell writes that perhaps the most influential writer on the subject was the English philosopher John Locke, whose &quot;Some Thoughts Concerning Education&quot; explicitly criticised the central role of corporal punishment in education. Locke&#x27;s work was highly influential, and may have helped influence Polish legislators to ban corporal punishment from Poland&#x27;s schools in 1783, the first country in the world to do so.

A consequence of this mode of thinking was a reduction in the use of corporal punishment in the 19th century in Europe and North America. In some countries this was encouraged by scandals involving individuals seriously hurt during acts of corporal punishment. For instance, in Britain, popular opposition to punishment was encouraged by two significant cases, the death of Private Frederick John White, who died after a military flogging in 1846, and the death of Reginald Cancellor, killed by his schoolmaster in 1860. Events such as these mobilised public opinion and, by the late nineteenth century, the extent of corporal punishment&#x27;s use in state schools was unpopular with many parents in England. Authorities in Britain and some other countries introduced more detailed rules for the infliction of corporal punishment in government institutions such as schools, prisons and reformatories. By the First World War, parents&#x27; complaints about disciplinary excesses in England had died down, and corporal punishment was established as an expected form of school discipline.

In the 1870s, courts in the United States overruled the common-law principle that a husband had the right to &quot;physically chastise an errant wife&quot;. In the UK, the traditional right of a husband to inflict moderate corporal punishment on his wife in order to keep her &quot;within the bounds of duty&quot; was similarly removed in 1891. See Domestic violence for more information.

In the United Kingdom, the use of judicial corporal punishment declined during the first half of the twentieth century and it was abolished altogether in the Criminal Justice Act, 1948 (zi &amp; z2 GEo. 6. CH. 58.), whereby whipping and flogging were outlawed except for use in very serious internal prison discipline cases, while most other European countries had abolished it earlier. Meanwhile, in many schools, the use of the cane, paddle or tawse remained commonplace in the UK and the United States until the 1980s. In rural areas of the Southern United States, and in several other countries, it still is: see School corporal punishment.

== International treaties ==
===Human rights===
Key developments related to corporal punishment occurred in the late 20th century. Years with particular significance to the prohibition of corporal punishment are emphasised.

** 2001: European Committee of Social Rights, overseeing its implementation, concludes: it is not &quot;acceptable that a society which prohibits any form of physical violence between adults would accept that adults subject children to physical violence.&quot;

===Children&#x27;s rights===

The notion of children&#x27;s rights in the Western world developed in the 20th century, but the issue of corporal punishment was not addressed generally before mid-century. Years with particular significance to the prohibition of corporal punishment of children are emphasised.

== Modern use ==


===Legal status===
67 countries, most of them in Europe and Latin America, have prohibited any corporal punishment of children.

The earliest recorded attempt to prohibit corporal punishment of children by a state dates back to Poland in 1783. However, its prohibition in all spheres of life – in homes, schools, the penal system and alternative care settings – occurred first in 1966 in Sweden. The 1979 Swedish Parental Code reads: &quot;Children are entitled to care, security and a good upbringing. Children are to be treated with respect for their person and individuality and may not be subjected to corporal punishment or any other humiliating treatment.&quot;

, corporal punishment of children by parents (or other adults) is outlawed altogether in 63 nations (including the partially recognized Republic of Kosovo) and 3 constituent nations.

For a more detailed overview of the global use and prohibition of the corporal punishment of children, see the following table.

===Corporal punishment in the home===
Domestic corporal punishment (i.e. the punishment of children by their parents) is often referred to colloquially as &quot;spanking&quot;, &quot;smacking&quot;, or &quot;slapping&quot;.

It has been outlawed in an increasing number of countries, starting with Sweden in 1979. In some other countries, corporal punishment is legal, but restricted (e.g. blows to the head are outlawed, implements may not be used, only children within a certain age range may be spanked).

In all states of the United States and most African and Asian nations, corporal punishment by parents is legal. It is also legal to use certain implements (e.g. a belt or a paddle).

In Canada, spanking by parents or legal guardians (but nobody else) is legal, with certain restrictions: the child must be between the ages of 2–12, and no implement other than an open, bare hand may be used (belts, paddles, etc. are prohibited). It is also illegal to strike the head when disciplining a child.

In the UK (except Scotland and Wales), spanking or smacking is legal, but it must not cause an injury amounting to actual bodily harm (any injury such as visible bruising, breaking of the whole skin, etc.). In addition, in Scotland, since October 2003, it has been illegal to use any implements or to strike the head when disciplining a child, and it is also prohibited to use corporal punishment towards children under the age of 3 years. In 2019, Scotland enacted a ban on corporal punishment, which went into effect in 2020. Wales also enacted a ban in 2020, which has gone into effect in 2022.

In Pakistan, Section 89 of Pakistan Penal Code allows corporal punishment.

In 2024, children&#x27;s doctors urged ministers to ban smacking children in England and Northern Ireland as their report warned that children suffer physically and mentally after being hit in their home. However, the UK government stated there were no plans to change the law on smacking in England and said it would observe the impact of legal amendments in Scotland and Wales.

===Corporal punishment in schools===

Corporal punishment in schools has been outlawed in many countries. It often involves striking the student on the buttocks or the palm of the hand with an implement (e.g. a rattan cane or a spanking paddle).

In countries where corporal punishment is still allowed in schools, there may be restrictions; for example, school caning in Singapore and Malaysia is, in theory, permitted for boys only.

In India and many other countries, corporal punishment has technically been abolished by law. However, corporal punishment continues to be practised on boys and girls in many schools around the world. Cultural perceptions of corporal punishment have rarely been studied and researched. One study carried out discusses how corporal punishment is perceived among parents and students in India.

Medical professionals have urged putting an end to the practice, noting the danger of injury to children&#x27;s hands especially.

===Judicial or quasi-judicial punishment===

Around 33 countries in the world still retain judicial corporal punishment, including a number of former British territories such as Botswana, Malaysia, Singapore and Tanzania. In Singapore, for certain specified offences, males are routinely sentenced to caning in addition to a prison term. The Singaporean practice of caning became much discussed around the world in 1994 when American teenager Michael P. Fay received four strokes of the cane for vandalism. Judicial caning and whipping are also used in Aceh Province in Indonesia.

A number of other countries with an Islamic legal system, such as Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, Iran, Brunei, Sudan, and some northern states in Nigeria, employ judicial whipping for a range of offences. In April 2020, the Saudi Supreme Court ended the flogging punishment from its court system, and replaced it with jail time or fines. , some regions of Pakistan are experiencing a breakdown of law and government, leading to a reintroduction of corporal punishment by &quot;ad hoc&quot; Islamicist courts. As well as corporal punishment, some Islamic countries such as Saudi Arabia and Iran use other kinds of physical penalties such as amputation or mutilation. However, the term &quot;corporal punishment&quot; has since the 19th century usually meant caning, flagellation or bastinado rather than those other types of physical penalty.

In some countries, foot whipping (&quot;bastinado&quot;) is still practised on prisoners.

==Effects==
According to a study headed by Harvard researchers, corporal punishment like spanking could affect the brain development of children. These effects are similar to the more severe form of violence. Corporal punishment is associated with physical injury and abuse, it erodes parent-child relationships, reduces cognitive abilities and IQ scores, leads to mental health problems including depression and anxiety, and it increases adult aggression and anti-social behaviors.

== Rituals ==
In parts of England, boys were once beaten under the old tradition of &quot;Beating the Bounds&quot; whereby a boy was paraded around the edge of a city or parish and spanked with a switch or cane to mark the boundary. One famous &quot;Beating the Bounds&quot; took place around the boundary of St Giles and the area where Tottenham Court Road now stands in central London. The actual stone that marked the boundary is now underneath the Centre Point office tower.

In the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and some parts of Hungary, a tradition for health and fertility is carried out on Easter Monday. Boys and young men will spank or whip girls and young women on the bottom with braided willow branches. After the man sings the verse, the young woman turns around and the man takes a few whacks at her backside with the whip.

<text>Genomics is an interdisciplinary field of molecular biology focusing on the structure, function, evolution, mapping, and editing of genomes. A genome is an organism&#x27;s complete set of DNA, including all of its genes as well as its hierarchical, three-dimensional structural configuration. In contrast to genetics, which refers to the study of &quot;individual&quot; genes and their roles in inheritance, genomics aims at the collective characterization and quantification of &quot;all&quot; of an organism&#x27;s genes, their interrelations and influence on the organism. Genes may direct the production of proteins with the assistance of enzymes and messenger molecules. In turn, proteins make up body structures such as organs and tissues as well as control chemical reactions and carry signals between cells. Genomics also involves the sequencing and analysis of genomes through uses of high throughput DNA sequencing and bioinformatics to assemble and analyze the function and structure of entire genomes. Advances in genomics have triggered a revolution in discovery-based research and systems biology to facilitate understanding of even the most complex biological systems such as the brain.

The field also includes studies of intragenomic (within the genome) phenomena such as epistasis (effect of one gene on another), pleiotropy (one gene affecting more than one trait), heterosis (hybrid vigour), and other interactions between loci and alleles within the genome.

== History ==

=== Etymology ===
From the Greek ΓΕΝ &quot;gen&quot;, &quot;gene&quot; (gamma, epsilon, nu, epsilon) meaning &quot;become, create, creation, birth&quot;, and subsequent variants: genealogy, genesis, genetics, genic, genomere, genotype, genus etc. While the word &quot;genome&quot; (from the German &quot;Genom&quot;, attributed to Hans Winkler) was in use in English as early as 1926, the term &quot;genomics&quot; was coined by Tom Roderick, a geneticist at the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Maine), over beers with Jim Womack, Tom Shows and Stephen O’Brien at a meeting held in Maryland on the mapping of the human genome in 1986. First as the name for a new journal and then as a whole new science discipline.

=== Early sequencing efforts ===
Following Rosalind Franklin&#x27;s confirmation of the helical structure of DNA, James D. Watson and Francis Crick&#x27;s publication of the structure of DNA in 1953 and Fred Sanger&#x27;s publication of the Amino acid sequence of insulin in 1955, nucleic acid sequencing became a major target of early molecular biologists. In 1964, Robert W. Holley and colleagues published the first nucleic acid sequence ever determined, the ribonucleotide sequence of alanine transfer RNA. Extending this work, Marshall Nirenberg and Philip Leder revealed the triplet nature of the genetic code and were able to determine the sequences of 54 out of 64 codons in their experiments. In 1972, Walter Fiers and his team at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology of the University of Ghent (Ghent, Belgium) were the first to determine the sequence of a gene: the gene for Bacteriophage MS2 coat protein. Fiers&#x27; group expanded on their MS2 coat protein work, determining the complete nucleotide-sequence of bacteriophage MS2-RNA (whose genome encodes just four genes in 3569 base pairs [bp]) and Simian virus 40 in 1976 and 1978, respectively.

=== DNA-sequencing technology developed ===
In addition to his seminal work on the amino acid sequence of insulin, Frederick Sanger and his colleagues played a key role in the development of DNA sequencing techniques that enabled the establishment of comprehensive genome sequencing projects. In 1975, he and Alan Coulson published a sequencing procedure using DNA polymerase with radiolabelled nucleotides that he called the &quot;Plus and Minus technique&quot;. This involved two closely related methods that generated short oligonucleotides with defined 3&#x27; termini. These could be fractionated by electrophoresis on a polyacrylamide gel (called polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) and visualised using autoradiography. The procedure could sequence up to 80 nucleotides in one go and was a big improvement, but was still very laborious. Nevertheless, in 1977 his group was able to sequence most of the 5,386 nucleotides of the single-stranded bacteriophage φX174, completing the first fully sequenced DNA-based genome. The refinement of the &quot;Plus and Minus&quot; method resulted in the chain-termination, or Sanger method (see below), which formed the basis of the techniques of DNA sequencing, genome mapping, data storage, and bioinformatic analysis most widely used in the following quarter-century of research. In the same year Walter Gilbert and Allan Maxam of Harvard University independently developed the Maxam-Gilbert method (also known as the &quot;chemical method&quot;) of DNA sequencing, involving the preferential cleavage of DNA at known bases, a less efficient method. For their groundbreaking work in the sequencing of nucleic acids, Gilbert and Sanger shared half the 1980 Nobel Prize in chemistry with Paul Berg (recombinant DNA).

=== Complete genomes ===
The advent of these technologies resulted in a rapid intensification in the scope and speed of completion of genome sequencing projects. The first complete genome sequence of a eukaryotic organelle, the human mitochondrion (16,568 bp, about 16.6 kb [kilobase]), was reported in 1981, and the first chloroplast genomes followed in 1986. In 1992, the first eukaryotic chromosome, chromosome III of brewer&#x27;s yeast &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; (315 kb) was sequenced. The first free-living organism to be sequenced was that of &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot; (1.8 Mb [megabase]) in 1995. The following year a consortium of researchers from laboratories across North America, Europe, and Japan announced the completion of the first complete genome sequence of a eukaryote, &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; (12.1 Mb), and since then genomes have continued being sequenced at an exponentially growing pace. , the complete sequences are available for: 2,719 viruses, 1,115 archaea and bacteria, and 36 eukaryotes, of which about half are fungi.

Most of the microorganisms whose genomes have been completely sequenced are problematic pathogens, such as &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot;, which has resulted in a pronounced bias in their phylogenetic distribution compared to the breadth of microbial diversity. Of the other sequenced species, most were chosen because they were well-studied model organisms or promised to become good models. Yeast (&quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;) has long been an important model organism for the eukaryotic cell, while the fruit fly &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; has been a very important tool (notably in early pre-molecular genetics). The worm &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot; is an often used simple model for multicellular organisms. The zebrafish &quot;Brachydanio rerio&quot; is used for many developmental studies on the molecular level, and the plant &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot; is a model organism for flowering plants. The Japanese pufferfish (&quot;Takifugu rubripes&quot;) and the spotted green pufferfish (&quot;Tetraodon nigroviridis&quot;) are interesting because of their small and compact genomes, which contain very little noncoding DNA compared to most species. The mammals dog (&quot;Canis familiaris&quot;), brown rat (&quot;Rattus norvegicus&quot;), mouse (&quot;Mus musculus&quot;), and chimpanzee (&quot;Pan troglodytes&quot;) are all important model animals in medical research.

A rough draft of the human genome was completed by the Human Genome Project in early 2001, creating much fanfare. This project, completed in 2003, sequenced the entire genome for one specific person, and by 2007 this sequence was declared &quot;finished&quot; (less than one error in 20,000 bases and all chromosomes assembled). In the years since then, the genomes of many other individuals have been sequenced, partly under the auspices of the 1000 Genomes Project, which announced the sequencing of 1,092 genomes in October 2012. Completion of this project was made possible by the development of dramatically more efficient sequencing technologies and required the commitment of significant bioinformatics resources from a large international collaboration. The continued analysis of human genomic data has profound political and social repercussions for human societies.

=== The &quot;omics&quot; revolution ===

The English-language neologism omics informally refers to a field of study in biology ending in &quot;-omics&quot;, such as genomics, proteomics or metabolomics. The related suffix -ome is used to address the objects of study of such fields, such as the genome, proteome, or metabolome (lipidome) respectively. The suffix &quot;-ome&quot; as used in molecular biology refers to a &quot;totality&quot; of some sort; similarly omics has come to refer generally to the study of large, comprehensive biological data sets. While the growth in the use of the term has led some scientists (Jonathan Eisen, among others) to claim that it has been oversold, it reflects the change in orientation towards the quantitative analysis of complete or near-complete assortment of all the constituents of a system. In the study of symbioses, for example, researchers which were once limited to the study of a single gene product can now simultaneously compare the total complement of several types of biological molecules.

== Genome analysis ==

After an organism has been selected, genome projects involve three components: the sequencing of DNA, the assembly of that sequence to create a representation of the original chromosome, and the annotation and analysis of that representation.
=== Sequencing ===

Historically, sequencing was done in &quot;sequencing centers&quot;, centralized facilities (ranging from large independent institutions such as Joint Genome Institute which sequence dozens of terabases a year, to local molecular biology core facilities) which contain research laboratories with the costly instrumentation and technical support necessary. As sequencing technology continues to improve, however, a new generation of effective fast turnaround benchtop sequencers has come within reach of the average academic laboratory. On the whole, genome sequencing approaches fall into two broad categories, &quot;shotgun&quot; and &quot;high-throughput&quot; (or &quot;next-generation&quot;) sequencing.

==== Shotgun sequencing ====

Shotgun sequencing is a sequencing method designed for analysis of DNA sequences longer than 1000 base pairs, up to and including entire chromosomes. It is named by analogy with the rapidly expanding, quasi-random firing pattern of a shotgun. Since gel electrophoresis sequencing can only be used for fairly short sequences (100 to 1000 base pairs), longer DNA sequences must be broken into random small segments which are then sequenced to obtain &quot;reads&quot;. Multiple overlapping reads for the target DNA are obtained by performing several rounds of this fragmentation and sequencing. Computer programs then use the overlapping ends of different reads to assemble them into a continuous sequence. Shotgun sequencing is a random sampling process, requiring over-sampling to ensure a given nucleotide is represented in the reconstructed sequence; the average number of reads by which a genome is over-sampled is referred to as coverage.

For much of its history, the technology underlying shotgun sequencing was the classical chain-termination method or &#x27;Sanger method&#x27;, which is based on the selective incorporation of chain-terminating dideoxynucleotides by DNA polymerase during in vitro DNA replication. Recently, shotgun sequencing has been supplanted by high-throughput sequencing methods, especially for large-scale, automated genome analyses. However, the Sanger method remains in wide use, primarily for smaller-scale projects and for obtaining especially long contiguous DNA sequence reads (&gt;500 nucleotides). Chain-termination methods require a single-stranded DNA template, a DNA primer, a DNA polymerase, normal deoxynucleosidetriphosphates (dNTPs), and modified nucleotides (dideoxyNTPs) that terminate DNA strand elongation. These chain-terminating nucleotides lack a 3&#x27;-OH group required for the formation of a phosphodiester bond between two nucleotides, causing DNA polymerase to cease extension of DNA when a ddNTP is incorporated. The ddNTPs may be radioactively or fluorescently labelled for detection in DNA sequencers. Typically, these machines can sequence up to 96 DNA samples in a single batch (run) in up to 48 runs a day.

==== High-throughput sequencing ====

The high demand for low-cost sequencing has driven the development of high-throughput sequencing technologies that parallelize the sequencing process, producing thousands or millions of sequences at once. High-throughput sequencing is intended to lower the cost of DNA sequencing beyond what is possible with standard dye-terminator methods. In ultra-high-throughput sequencing, as many as 500,000 sequencing-by-synthesis operations may be run in parallel.
The Illumina dye sequencing method is based on reversible dye-terminators and was developed in 1996 at the Geneva Biomedical Research Institute, by Pascal Mayer and Laurent Farinelli. In this method, DNA molecules and primers are first attached on a slide and amplified with polymerase so that local clonal colonies, initially coined &quot;DNA colonies&quot;, are formed. To determine the sequence, four types of reversible terminator bases (RT-bases) are added and non-incorporated nucleotides are washed away. Unlike pyrosequencing, the DNA chains are extended one nucleotide at a time and image acquisition can be performed at a delayed moment, allowing for very large arrays of DNA colonies to be captured by sequential images taken from a single camera. Decoupling the enzymatic reaction and the image capture allows for optimal throughput and theoretically unlimited sequencing capacity; with an optimal configuration, the ultimate throughput of the instrument depends only on the A/D conversion rate of the camera. The camera takes images of the fluorescently labeled nucleotides, then the dye along with the terminal 3&#x27; blocker is chemically removed from the DNA, allowing the next cycle.

An alternative approach, ion semiconductor sequencing, is based on standard DNA replication chemistry. This technology measures the release of a hydrogen ion each time a base is incorporated. A microwell containing template DNA is flooded with a single nucleotide, if the nucleotide is complementary to the template strand it will be incorporated and a hydrogen ion will be released. This release triggers an ISFET ion sensor. If a homopolymer is present in the template sequence multiple nucleotides will be incorporated in a single flood cycle, and the detected electrical signal will be proportionally higher.

=== Assembly ===

Sequence assembly refers to aligning and merging fragments of a much longer DNA sequence in order to reconstruct the original sequence. This is needed as current DNA sequencing technology cannot read whole genomes as a continuous sequence, but rather reads small pieces of between 20 and 1000 bases, depending on the technology used. Third generation sequencing technologies such as PacBio or Oxford Nanopore routinely generate sequencing reads 10-100 kb in length; however, they have a high error rate at approximately 1 percent. Typically the short fragments, called reads, result from shotgun sequencing genomic DNA, or gene transcripts (ESTs).

==== Assembly approaches ====
Assembly can be broadly categorized into two approaches: &quot;de novo&quot; assembly, for genomes which are not similar to any sequenced in the past, and comparative assembly, which uses the existing sequence of a closely related organism as a reference during assembly. Relative to comparative assembly, &quot;de novo&quot; assembly is computationally difficult (NP-hard), making it less favourable for short-read NGS technologies. Within the &quot;de novo&quot; assembly paradigm there are two primary strategies for assembly, Eulerian path strategies, and overlap-layout-consensus (OLC) strategies. OLC strategies ultimately try to create a Hamiltonian path through an overlap graph which is an NP-hard problem. Eulerian path strategies are computationally more tractable because they try to find a Eulerian path through a deBruijn graph.

==== Finishing ====
Finished genomes are defined as having a single contiguous sequence with no ambiguities representing each replicon.

=== Annotation ===

The DNA sequence assembly alone is of little value without additional analysis. Genome annotation is the process of attaching biological information to sequences, and consists of three main steps:
# identifying portions of the genome that do not code for proteins
# identifying elements on the genome, a process called gene prediction, and
# attaching biological information to these elements.
Automatic annotation tools try to perform these steps &quot;in silico&quot;, as opposed to manual annotation (a.k.a. curation) which involves human expertise and potential experimental verification. Ideally, these approaches co-exist and complement each other in the same annotation pipeline (also see below).

Traditionally, the basic level of annotation is using BLAST for finding similarities, and then annotating genomes based on homologues. More recently, additional information is added to the annotation platform. The additional information allows manual annotators to deconvolute discrepancies between genes that are given the same annotation. Some databases use genome context information, similarity scores, experimental data, and integrations of other resources to provide genome annotations through their Subsystems approach. Other databases (e.g. Ensembl) rely on both curated data sources as well as a range of software tools in their automated genome annotation pipeline. &quot;Structural annotation&quot; consists of the identification of genomic elements, primarily ORFs and their localisation, or gene structure. &quot;Functional annotation&quot; consists of attaching biological information to genomic elements.

=== Sequencing pipelines and databases ===

The need for reproducibility and efficient management of the large amount of data associated with genome projects mean that computational pipelines have important applications in genomics.

== Research areas ==

=== Functional genomics ===

Functional genomics is a field of molecular biology that attempts to make use of the vast wealth of data produced by genomic projects (such as genome sequencing projects) to describe gene (and protein) functions and interactions. Functional genomics focuses on the dynamic aspects such as gene transcription, translation, and protein–protein interactions, as opposed to the static aspects of the genomic information such as DNA sequence or structures. Functional genomics attempts to answer questions about the function of DNA at the levels of genes, RNA transcripts, and protein products. A key characteristic of functional genomics studies is their genome-wide approach to these questions, generally involving high-throughput methods rather than a more traditional &quot;gene-by-gene&quot; approach.

A major branch of genomics is still concerned with sequencing the genomes of various organisms, but the knowledge of full genomes has created the possibility for the field of functional genomics, mainly concerned with patterns of gene expression during various conditions. The most important tools here are microarrays and bioinformatics.

=== Structural genomics ===
Structural genomics seeks to describe the 3-dimensional structure of every protein encoded by a given genome. This genome-based approach allows for a high-throughput method of structure determination by a combination of experimental and modeling approaches. The principal difference between structural genomics and traditional structural prediction is that structural genomics attempts to determine the structure of every protein encoded by the genome, rather than focusing on one particular protein. With full-genome sequences available, structure prediction can be done more quickly through a combination of experimental and modeling approaches, especially because the availability of large numbers of sequenced genomes and previously solved protein structures allow scientists to model protein structure on the structures of previously solved homologs. Structural genomics involves taking a large number of approaches to structure determination, including experimental methods using genomic sequences or modeling-based approaches based on sequence or structural homology to a protein of known structure or based on chemical and physical principles for a protein with no homology to any known structure. As opposed to traditional structural biology, the determination of a protein structure through a structural genomics effort often (but not always) comes before anything is known regarding the protein function. This raises new challenges in structural bioinformatics, i.e. determining protein function from its 3D structure.

=== Epigenomics ===

Epigenomics is the study of the complete set of epigenetic modifications on the genetic material of a cell, known as the epigenome. Epigenetic modifications are reversible modifications on a cell&#x27;s DNA or histones that affect gene expression without altering the DNA sequence (Russell 2010 p. 475). Two of the most characterized epigenetic modifications are DNA methylation and histone modification. Epigenetic modifications play an important role in gene expression and regulation, and are involved in numerous cellular processes such as in differentiation/development and tumorigenesis. The study of epigenetics on a global level has been made possible only recently through the adaptation of genomic high-throughput assays.

=== Metagenomics ===

Metagenomics is the study of &quot;metagenomes&quot;, genetic material recovered directly from environmental samples. The broad field may also be referred to as environmental genomics, ecogenomics or community genomics. While traditional microbiology and microbial genome sequencing rely upon cultivated clonal cultures, early environmental gene sequencing cloned specific genes (often the 16S rRNA gene) to produce a profile of diversity in a natural sample. Such work revealed that the vast majority of microbial biodiversity had been missed by cultivation-based methods. Recent studies use &quot;shotgun&quot; Sanger sequencing or massively parallel pyrosequencing to get largely unbiased samples of all genes from all the members of the sampled communities. Because of its power to reveal the previously hidden diversity of microscopic life, metagenomics offers a powerful lens for viewing the microbial world that has the potential to revolutionize understanding of the entire living world.

=== Model systems ===

==== Viruses and bacteriophages ====
Bacteriophages have played and continue to play a key role in bacterial genetics and molecular biology. Historically, they were used to define gene structure and gene regulation. Also the first genome to be sequenced was a bacteriophage. However, bacteriophage research did not lead the genomics revolution, which is clearly dominated by bacterial genomics. Only very recently has the study of bacteriophage genomes become prominent, thereby enabling researchers to understand the mechanisms underlying phage evolution. Bacteriophage genome sequences can be obtained through direct sequencing of isolated bacteriophages, but can also be derived as part of microbial genomes. Analysis of bacterial genomes has shown that a substantial amount of microbial DNA consists of prophage sequences and prophage-like elements. A detailed database mining of these sequences offers insights into the role of prophages in shaping the bacterial genome: Overall, this method verified many known bacteriophage groups, making this a useful tool for predicting the relationships of prophages from bacterial genomes.

==== Cyanobacteria ====
At present there are 24 cyanobacteria for which a total genome sequence is available. 15 of these cyanobacteria come from the marine environment. These are six &quot;Prochlorococcus&quot; strains, seven marine &quot;Synechococcus&quot; strains, &quot;Trichodesmium erythraeum&quot; IMS101 and &quot;Crocosphaera watsonii&quot; WH8501. Several studies have demonstrated how these sequences could be used very successfully to infer important ecological and physiological characteristics of marine cyanobacteria. However, there are many more genome projects currently in progress, amongst those there are further &quot;Prochlorococcus&quot; and marine &quot;Synechococcus&quot; isolates, &quot;Acaryochloris&quot; and &quot;Prochloron&quot;, the N2-fixing filamentous cyanobacteria &quot;Nodularia spumigena&quot;, &quot;Lyngbya aestuarii&quot; and &quot;Lyngbya majuscula&quot;, as well as bacteriophages infecting marine cyanobaceria. Thus, the growing body of genome information can also be tapped in a more general way to address global problems by applying a comparative approach. Some new and exciting examples of progress in this field are the identification of genes for regulatory RNAs, insights into the evolutionary origin of photosynthesis, or estimation of the contribution of horizontal gene transfer to the genomes that have been analyzed.

== Applications ==
Genomics has provided applications in many fields, including medicine, biotechnology, anthropology and other social sciences.

=== Genomic medicine ===
Next-generation genomic technologies allow clinicians and biomedical researchers to drastically increase the amount of genomic data collected on large study populations. When combined with new informatics approaches that integrate many kinds of data with genomic data in disease research, this allows researchers to better understand the genetic bases of drug response and disease.

Early efforts to apply the genome to medicine included those by a Stanford team led by Euan Ashley who developed the first tools for the medical interpretation of a human genome. The Genomes2People research program at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Broad Institute and Harvard Medical School was established in 2012 to conduct empirical research in translating genomics into health. Brigham and Women&#x27;s Hospital opened a Preventive Genomics Clinic in August 2019, with Massachusetts General Hospital following a month later. The &quot;All of Us&quot; research program aims to collect genome sequence data from 1 million participants to become a critical component of the precision medicine research platform and the &quot;UK Biobank&quot; initiative has studied more than 500.000 individuals with deep genomic and phenotypic data.

=== Synthetic biology and bioengineering ===
The growth of genomic knowledge has enabled increasingly sophisticated applications of synthetic biology. In 2010 researchers at the J. Craig Venter Institute announced the creation of a partially synthetic species of bacterium, &quot;Mycoplasma laboratorium&quot;, derived from the genome of &quot;Mycoplasma genitalium&quot;.

=== Population and conservation genomics ===
Population genomics has developed as a popular field of research, where genomic sequencing methods are used to conduct large-scale comparisons of DNA sequences among populations - beyond the limits of genetic markers such as short-range PCR products or microsatellites traditionally used in population genetics. Population genomics studies genome-wide effects to improve our understanding of microevolution so that we may learn the phylogenetic history and demography of a population. Population genomic methods are used for many different fields including evolutionary biology, ecology, biogeography, conservation biology and fisheries management. Similarly, landscape genomics has developed from landscape genetics to use genomic methods to identify relationships between patterns of environmental and genetic variation.

Conservationists can use the information gathered by genomic sequencing in order to better evaluate genetic factors key to species conservation, such as the genetic diversity of a population or whether an individual is heterozygous for a recessive inherited genetic disorder. By using genomic data to evaluate the effects of evolutionary processes and to detect patterns in variation throughout a given population, conservationists can formulate plans to aid a given species without as many variables left unknown as those unaddressed by standard genetic approaches.

<text>Proteomics is the large-scale study of proteins. Proteins are vital macromolecules of all living organisms, with many functions such as the formation of structural fibers of muscle tissue, enzymatic digestion of food, or synthesis and replication of DNA. In addition, other kinds of proteins include antibodies that protect an organism from infection, and hormones that send important signals throughout the body.

The proteome is the entire set of proteins produced or modified by an organism or system. Proteomics enables the identification of ever-increasing numbers of proteins. This varies with time and distinct requirements, or stresses, that a cell or organism undergoes.

Proteomics is an interdisciplinary domain that has benefited greatly from the genetic information of various genome projects, including the Human Genome Project. It covers the exploration of proteomes from the overall level of protein composition, structure, and activity, and is an important component of functional genomics.

&quot;Proteomics&quot; generally denotes the large-scale experimental analysis of proteins and proteomes, but often refers specifically to protein purification and mass spectrometry. Indeed, mass spectrometry is the most powerful method for analysis of proteomes, both in large samples composed of millions of cells and in single cells.

==History and etymology==
The first studies of proteins that could be regarded as proteomics began in 1974, after the introduction of the two-dimensional gel and mapping of the proteins from the bacterium &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;.

&quot;Proteome&quot; is a blend of the words &quot;protein&quot; and &quot;genome&quot;. It was coined in 1994 by then-Ph.D student Marc Wilkins at Macquarie University, which founded the first dedicated proteomics laboratory in 1995.

==Complexity of the problem==
After genomics and transcriptomics, proteomics is the next step in the study of biological systems. It is more complicated than genomics because an organism&#x27;s genome is more or less constant, whereas proteomes differ from cell to cell and from time to time. Distinct genes are expressed in different cell types, which means that even the basic set of proteins produced in a cell must be identified.

In the past this phenomenon was assessed by RNA analysis, which was found to lack correlation with protein content. It is now known that mRNA is not always translated into protein, and the amount of protein produced for a given amount of mRNA depends on the gene it is transcribed from and on the cell&#x27;s physiological state. Proteomics confirms the presence of the protein and provides a direct measure of its quantity.

===Post-translational modifications===

Not only does the translation from mRNA cause differences, but many proteins also are subjected to a wide variety of chemical modifications after translation. The most common and widely studied post-translational modifications include phosphorylation and glycosylation. Many of these post-translational modifications are critical to the protein&#x27;s function.

====Phosphorylation====
One such modification is phosphorylation, which happens to many enzymes and structural proteins in the process of cell signaling. The addition of a phosphate to particular amino acids—most commonly serine and threonine mediated by serine-threonine kinases, or more rarely tyrosine mediated by tyrosine kinases—causes a protein to become a target for binding or interacting with a distinct set of other proteins that recognize the phosphorylated domain.

Because protein phosphorylation is one of the most studied protein modifications, many &quot;proteomic&quot; efforts are geared to determining the set of phosphorylated proteins in a particular cell or tissue-type under particular circumstances. This alerts the scientist to the signaling pathways that may be active in that instance.

====Ubiquitination====
Ubiquitin is a small protein that may be affixed to certain protein substrates by enzymes called E3 ubiquitin ligases. Determining which proteins are poly-ubiquitinated helps understand how protein pathways are regulated. This is, therefore, an additional legitimate &quot;proteomic&quot; study. Similarly, once a researcher determines which substrates are ubiquitinated by each ligase, determining the set of ligases expressed in a particular cell type is helpful.

====Additional modifications====
In addition to phosphorylation and ubiquitination, proteins may be subjected to (among others) methylation, acetylation, glycosylation, oxidation, and nitrosylation. Some proteins undergo all these modifications, often in time-dependent combinations. This illustrates the potential complexity of studying protein structure and function.

===Distinct proteins are made under distinct settings===
A cell may make different sets of proteins at different times or under different conditions, for example during development, cellular differentiation, cell cycle, or carcinogenesis. Further increasing proteome complexity, as mentioned, most proteins are able to undergo a wide range of post-translational modifications.

Therefore, a &quot;proteomics&quot; study may become complex very quickly, even if the topic of study is restricted. In more ambitious settings, such as when a biomarker for a specific cancer subtype is sought, the proteomics scientist might elect to study multiple blood serum samples from multiple cancer patients to minimise confounding factors and account for experimental noise. Thus, complicated experimental designs are sometimes necessary to account for the dynamic complexity of the proteome.

==Limitations of genomics and proteomics studies==
Proteomics gives a different level of understanding than genomics for many reasons:
* the level of transcription of a gene gives only a rough estimate of its &quot;level of translation&quot; into a protein. An mRNA produced in abundance may be degraded rapidly or translated inefficiently, resulting in a small amount of protein.
* as mentioned above, many proteins experience &quot;post-translational modifications&quot; that profoundly affect their activities; for example, some proteins are not active until they become phosphorylated. Methods such as phosphoproteomics and glycoproteomics are used to study post-translational modifications.
* many transcripts give rise to more than one protein, through alternative splicing or alternative post-translational modifications.
* many proteins form complexes with other proteins or RNA molecules, and only function in the presence of these other molecules.
* protein degradation rate plays an important role in protein content.

&quot;Reproducibility&quot;. One major factor affecting reproducibility in proteomics experiments is the simultaneous elution of many more peptides than mass spectrometers can measure. This causes stochastic differences between experiments due to data-dependent acquisition of tryptic peptides. Although early large-scale shotgun proteomics analyses showed considerable variability between laboratories, presumably due in part to technical and experimental differences between laboratories, reproducibility has been improved in more recent mass spectrometry analysis, particularly on the protein level. Notably, targeted proteomics shows increased reproducibility and repeatability compared with shotgun methods, although at the expense of data density and effectiveness.

&quot;Data quality&quot;. Proteomic analysis is highly amenable to automation and large data sets are created, which are processed by software algorithms. Filter parameters are used to reduce the number of false hits, but they cannot be completely eliminated. Scientists have expressed the need for awareness that proteomics experiments should adhere to the criteria of analytical chemistry (sufficient data quality, sanity check, validation).

==Methods of studying proteins==
In proteomics, there are multiple methods to study proteins. Generally, proteins may be detected by using either antibodies (immunoassays), electrophoretic separation or mass spectrometry. If a complex biological sample is analyzed, either a very specific antibody needs to be used in quantitative dot blot analysis (QDB), or biochemical separation then needs to be used before the detection step, as there are too many analytes in the sample to perform accurate detection and quantification.

=== Protein detection with antibodies (immunoassays) ===
Antibodies to particular proteins, or their modified forms, have been used in biochemistry and cell biology studies. These are among the most common tools used by molecular biologists today. There are several specific techniques and protocols that use antibodies for protein detection. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has been used for decades to detect and quantitatively measure proteins in samples. The western blot may be used for detection and quantification of individual proteins, where in an initial step, a complex protein mixture is separated using SDS-PAGE and then the protein of interest is identified using an antibody.

Modified proteins may be studied by developing an antibody specific to that modification. For example, some antibodies only recognize certain proteins when they are tyrosine-phosphorylated, they are known as phospho-specific antibodies. Also, there are antibodies specific to other modifications. These may be used to determine the set of proteins that have undergone the modification of interest.

Immunoassays can also be carried out using recombinantly generated immunoglobulin derivatives or synthetically designed protein scaffolds that are selected for high antigen specificity. Such binders include single domain antibody fragments (Nanobodies), designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins) and aptamers.

Disease detection at the molecular level is driving the emerging revolution of early diagnosis and treatment. A challenge facing the field is that protein biomarkers for early diagnosis may be present in very low abundance. The lower limit of detection with conventional immunoassay technology is the upper femtomolar range (10−13 M). Digital immunoassay technology has improved detection sensitivity three logs, to the attomolar range (10−16 M). This capability has the potential to open new advances in diagnostics and therapeutics, but such technologies have been relegated to manual procedures that are not well suited for efficient routine use.

=== Antibody-free protein detection ===
While protein detection with antibodies is still very common in molecular biology, other methods have been developed as well, that do not rely on an antibody. These methods offer various advantages, for instance they often are able to determine the sequence of a protein or peptide, they may have higher throughput than antibody-based, and they sometimes can identify and quantify proteins for which no antibody exists.

==== Detection methods ====
One of the earliest methods for protein analysis has been Edman degradation (introduced in 1967) where a single peptide is subjected to multiple steps of chemical degradation to resolve its sequence. These early methods have mostly been supplanted by technologies that offer higher throughput.

More recently implemented methods use mass spectrometry-based techniques, a development that was made possible by the discovery of &quot;soft ionization&quot; methods developed in the 1980s, such as matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) and electrospray ionization (ESI). These methods gave rise to the top-down and the bottom-up proteomics workflows where often additional separation is performed before analysis (see below).

==== Separation methods ====
For the analysis of complex biological samples, a reduction of sample complexity is required. This may be performed off-line by one-dimensional or two-dimensional separation. More recently, on-line methods have been developed where individual peptides (in bottom-up proteomics approaches) are separated using reversed-phase chromatography and then, directly ionized using ESI; the direct coupling of separation and analysis explains the term &quot;on-line&quot; analysis.

=== Hybrid technologies ===
Several hybrid technologies use antibody-based purification of individual analytes and then perform mass spectrometric analysis for identification and quantification. Examples of these methods are the
MSIA (mass spectrometric immunoassay), developed by Randall Nelson in 1995, and the SISCAPA (Stable Isotope Standard Capture with Anti-Peptide Antibodies) method, introduced by Leigh Anderson in 2004.

===Current research methodologies===
Fluorescence two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis (2-D DIGE) may be used to quantify variation in the 2-D DIGE process and establish statistically valid thresholds for assigning quantitative changes between samples.

Comparative proteomic analysis may reveal the role of proteins in complex biological systems, including reproduction. For example, treatment with the insecticide triazophos causes an increase in the content of brown planthopper (&quot;Nilaparvata lugens&quot; (Stål)) male accessory gland proteins (Acps) that may be transferred to females via mating, causing an increase in fecundity (i.e. birth rate) of females. To identify changes in the types of accessory gland proteins (Acps) and reproductive proteins that mated female planthoppers received from male planthoppers, researchers conducted a comparative proteomic analysis of mated &quot;N. lugens&quot; females. The results indicated that these proteins participate in the reproductive process of &quot;N. lugens&quot; adult females and males.

Proteome analysis of &quot;Arabidopsis peroxisomes&quot; has been established as the major unbiased approach for identifying new peroxisomal proteins on a large scale.

There are many approaches to characterizing the human proteome, which is estimated to contain between 20,000 and 25,000 non-redundant proteins. The number of unique protein species likely will increase by between 50,000 and 500,000 due to RNA splicing and proteolysis events, and when post-translational modification also are considered, the total number of unique human proteins is estimated to range in the low millions.

In addition, the first promising attempts to decipher the proteome of animal tumors have recently been reported.
This method was used as a functional method in &quot;Macrobrachium rosenbergii&quot; protein profiling.

===High-throughput proteomic technologies===
Proteomics has steadily gained momentum over the past decade with the evolution of several approaches. Few of these are new, and others build on traditional methods. Mass spectrometry-based methods, affinity proteomics, and micro arrays are the most common technologies for large-scale study of proteins.

====Mass spectrometry and protein profiling====
There are two mass spectrometry-based methods currently used for protein profiling. The more established and widespread method uses high resolution, two-dimensional electrophoresis to separate proteins from different samples in parallel, followed by selection and staining of differentially expressed proteins to be identified by mass spectrometry. Despite the advances in 2-DE and its maturity, it has its limits as well.
The central concern is the inability to resolve all the proteins within a sample, given their dramatic range in expression level and differing properties. The combination of pore size, and protein charge, size and shape can greatly determine migration rate which leads to other complications.

The second quantitative approach uses stable isotope tags to differentially label proteins from two different complex mixtures. Here, the proteins within a complex mixture are labeled isotopically first, and then digested to yield labeled peptides. The labeled mixtures are then combined, the peptides separated by multidimensional liquid chromatography and analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry. Isotope coded affinity tag (ICAT) reagents are the widely used isotope tags. In this method, the cysteine residues of proteins get covalently attached to the ICAT reagent, thereby reducing the complexity of the mixtures omitting the non-cysteine residues.

Quantitative proteomics using stable isotopic tagging is an increasingly useful tool in modern development. Firstly, chemical reactions have been used to introduce tags into specific sites or proteins for the purpose of probing specific protein functionalities. The isolation of phosphorylated peptides has been achieved using isotopic labeling and selective chemistries to capture the fraction of protein among the complex mixture. Secondly, the ICAT technology was used to differentiate between partially purified or purified macromolecular complexes such as large RNA polymerase II pre-initiation complex and the proteins complexed with yeast transcription factor. Thirdly, ICAT labeling was recently combined with chromatin isolation to identify and quantify chromatin-associated proteins. Finally ICAT reagents are useful for proteomic profiling of cellular organelles and specific cellular fractions.

Another quantitative approach is the accurate mass and time (AMT) tag approach developed by Richard D. Smith and coworkers at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. In this approach, increased throughput and sensitivity is achieved by avoiding the need for tandem mass spectrometry, and making use of precisely determined separation time information and highly accurate mass determinations for peptide and protein identifications.

==== Affinity proteomics ====
Affinity proteomics uses antibodies or other affinity reagents (such as oligonucleotide-based aptamers) as protein-specific detection probes. Currently this method can interrogate several thousand proteins, typically from biofluids such as plasma, serum or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). A key differentiator for this technology is the ability to analyze hundreds or thousands of samples in a reasonable timeframe (a matter of days or weeks); mass spectrometry-based methods are not scalable to this level of sample throughput for proteomics analyses.

====Protein chips====
Balancing the use of mass spectrometers in proteomics and in medicine is the use of protein micro arrays. The aim behind protein micro arrays is to print thousands of protein detecting features for the interrogation of biological samples. Antibody arrays are an example in which a host of different antibodies are arrayed to detect their respective antigens from a sample of human blood. Another approach is the arraying of multiple protein types for the study of properties like protein-DNA, protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions. Ideally, the functional proteomic arrays would contain the entire complement of the proteins of a given organism. The first version of such arrays consisted of 5000 purified proteins from yeast deposited onto glass microscopic slides. Despite the success of first chip, it was a greater challenge for protein arrays to be implemented. Proteins are inherently much more difficult to work with than DNA. They have a broad dynamic range, are less stable than DNA and their structure is difficult to preserve on glass slides, though they are essential for most assays. The global ICAT technology has striking advantages over protein chip technologies.

====Reverse-phased protein microarrays====

This is a promising and newer microarray application for the diagnosis, study and treatment of complex diseases such as cancer. The technology merges laser capture microdissection (LCM) with micro array technology, to produce reverse-phase protein microarrays. In this type of microarrays, the whole collection of protein themselves are immobilized with the intent of capturing various stages of disease within an individual patient. When used with LCM, reverse phase arrays can monitor the fluctuating state of proteome among different cell population within a small area of human tissue. This is useful for profiling the status of cellular signaling molecules, among a cross-section of tissue that includes both normal and cancerous cells. This approach is useful in monitoring the status of key factors in normal prostate epithelium and invasive prostate cancer tissues. LCM then dissects these tissue and protein lysates were arrayed onto nitrocellulose slides, which were probed with specific antibodies. This method can track all kinds of molecular events and can compare diseased and healthy tissues within the same patient enabling the development of treatment strategies and diagnosis. The ability to acquire proteomics snapshots of neighboring cell populations, using reverse-phase microarrays in conjunction with LCM has a number of applications beyond the study of tumors. The approach can provide insights into normal physiology and pathology of all the tissues and is invaluable for characterizing developmental processes and anomalies.

=== Protein Detection via Bioorthogonal Chemistry ===

Recent advancements in bioorthogonal chemistry have revealed applications in protein analysis. The extension of using organic molecules to observe their reaction with proteins reveals extensive methods to tag them. Unnatural amino acids and various functional groups represent new growing technologies in proteomics.

Specific biomolecules that are capable of being metabolized in cells or tissues are inserted into proteins or glycans. The molecule will have an affinity tag, modifying the protein allowing it to be detected. Azidohomoalanine (AHA) utilizes this affinity tag via incorporation with Met-t-RNA synthetase to incorporate into proteins. This has allowed AHA to assist in determine the identity of newly synthesized proteins created in response to perturbations and to identify proteins secreted by cells.

Recent studies using ketones and aldehydes condensations show that they are best suited for in vitro or cell surface labeling. However, using ketones and aldehydes as bioorthogonal reporters revealed slow kinetics indicating that while effective for labeling, the concentration must be high.

Certain proteins can be detected via their reactivity to azide groups. Non-proteinogenic amino acids can bear azide groups which react with phosphines in Staudinger ligations. This reaction has already been used to label other biomolecules in living cells and animals.

The bioorthoganal field is expanding and is driving further applications within proteomics. It is worthwhile noting the limitations and benefits. Rapid reactions can create bioconjuctions and create high concentrations with low amounts of reactants. Contrarily slow kinetic reactions like aldehyde and ketone condensation while effective require a high concentration making it cost inefficient.

==Practical applications==

===New drug discovery===
One major development to come from the study of human genes and proteins has been the identification of potential new drugs for the treatment of disease. This relies on genome and proteome information to identify proteins associated with a disease, which computer software can then use as targets for new drugs. For example, if a certain protein is implicated in a disease, its 3D structure provides the information to design drugs to interfere with the action of the protein. A molecule that fits the active site of an enzyme, but cannot be released by the enzyme, inactivates the enzyme. This is the basis of new drug-discovery tools, which aim to find new drugs to inactivate proteins involved in disease. As genetic differences among individuals are found, researchers expect to use these techniques to develop personalized drugs that are more effective for the individual.

Proteomics is also used to reveal complex plant-insect interactions that help identify candidate genes involved in the defensive response of plants to herbivory.

A branch of proteomics called chemoproteomics provides numerous tools and techniques to detect protein targets of drugs.

===Interaction proteomics and protein networks===
Interaction proteomics is the analysis of protein interactions from scales of binary interactions to proteome- or network-wide. Most proteins function via protein–protein interactions, and one goal of interaction proteomics is to identify binary protein interactions, protein complexes, and interactomes.

Several methods are available to probe protein–protein interactions. While the most traditional method is yeast two-hybrid analysis, a powerful emerging method is affinity purification followed by protein mass spectrometry using tagged protein baits. Other methods include surface plasmon resonance (SPR), protein microarrays, dual polarisation interferometry, microscale thermophoresis, kinetic exclusion assay, and experimental methods such as phage display and &quot;in silico&quot; computational methods.

Knowledge of protein-protein interactions is especially useful in regard to biological networks and systems biology, for example in cell signaling cascades and gene regulatory networks (GRNs, where knowledge of protein-DNA interactions is also informative). Proteome-wide analysis of protein interactions, and integration of these interaction patterns into larger biological networks, is crucial towards understanding systems-level biology.

===Expression proteomics===
Expression proteomics includes the analysis of protein expression at a larger scale. It helps identify main proteins in a particular sample, and those proteins differentially expressed in related samples—such as diseased vs. healthy tissue. If a protein is found only in a diseased sample then it can be a useful drug target or diagnostic marker. Proteins with the same or similar expression profiles may also be functionally related. There are technologies such as 2D-PAGE and mass spectrometry that are used in expression proteomics.

===Biomarkers===

The National Institutes of Health has defined a biomarker as &quot;a characteristic that is objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention.&quot;

Understanding the proteome, the structure and function of each protein and the complexities of protein–protein interactions are critical for developing the most effective diagnostic techniques and disease treatments in the future. For example, proteomics is highly useful in the identification of candidate biomarkers (proteins in body fluids that are of value for diagnosis), identification of the bacterial antigens that are targeted by the immune response, and identification of possible immunohistochemistry markers of infectious or neoplastic diseases.

An interesting use of proteomics is using specific protein biomarkers to diagnose disease. A number of techniques allow to test for proteins produced during a particular disease, which helps to diagnose the disease quickly. Techniques include western blot, immunohistochemical staining, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or mass spectrometry. Secretomics, a subfield of proteomics that studies secreted proteins and secretion pathways using proteomic approaches, has recently emerged as an important tool for the discovery of biomarkers of disease.

===Proteogenomics===
In proteogenomics, proteomic technologies such as mass spectrometry are used for improving gene annotations. Parallel analysis of the genome and the proteome facilitates discovery of post-translational modifications and proteolytic events, especially when comparing multiple species (comparative proteogenomics).

===Structural proteomics===
Structural proteomics includes the analysis of protein structures at large-scale. It compares protein structures and helps identify functions of newly discovered genes. The structural analysis also helps to understand that where drugs bind to proteins and also shows where proteins interact with each other. This understanding is achieved using different technologies such as X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy.

==Bioinformatics for proteomics (proteome informatics)==
Much proteomics data is collected with the help of high throughput technologies such as mass spectrometry and microarray. It would often take weeks or months to analyze the data and perform comparisons by hand. For this reason, biologists and chemists are collaborating with computer scientists and mathematicians to create programs and pipeline to computationally analyze the protein data. Using bioinformatics techniques, researchers are capable of faster analysis and data storage. A good place to find lists of current programs and databases is on the ExPASy bioinformatics resource portal. The applications of bioinformatics-based proteomics include medicine, disease diagnosis, biomarker identification, and many more.

===Protein identification===
Mass spectrometry and microarray produce peptide fragmentation information but do not give identification of specific proteins present in the original sample. Due to the lack of specific protein identification, past researchers were forced to decipher the peptide fragments themselves. However, there are currently programs available for protein identification. These programs take the peptide sequences output from mass spectrometry and microarray and return information about matching or similar proteins. This is done through algorithms implemented by the program which perform alignments with proteins from known databases such as UniProt and PROSITE to predict what proteins are in the sample with a degree of certainty.

===Protein structure===

The biomolecular structure forms the 3D configuration of the protein. Understanding the protein&#x27;s structure aids in the identification of the protein&#x27;s interactions and function. It used to be that the 3D structure of proteins could only be determined using X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy. As of 2017, Cryo-electron microscopy is a leading technique, solving difficulties with crystallization (in X-ray crystallography) and conformational ambiguity (in NMR); resolution was 2.2Å as of 2015. Now, through bioinformatics, there are computer programs that can in some cases predict and model the structure of proteins. These programs use the chemical properties of amino acids and structural properties of known proteins to predict the 3D model of sample proteins. This also allows scientists to model protein interactions on a larger scale. In addition, biomedical engineers are developing methods to factor in the flexibility of protein structures to make comparisons and predictions.

===Post-translational modifications===
Most programs available for protein analysis are not written for proteins that have undergone post-translational modifications. Some programs will accept post-translational modifications to aid in protein identification but then ignore the modification during further protein analysis. It is important to account for these modifications since they can affect the protein&#x27;s structure. In turn, computational analysis of post-translational modifications has gained the attention of the scientific community. The current post-translational modification programs are only predictive. Chemists, biologists and computer scientists are working together to create and introduce new pipelines that allow for analysis of post-translational modifications that have been experimentally identified for their effect on the protein&#x27;s structure and function.

===Computational methods in studying protein biomarkers===
One example of the use of bioinformatics and the use of computational methods is the study of protein biomarkers. Computational predictive models have shown that extensive and diverse feto-maternal protein trafficking occurs during pregnancy and can be readily detected non-invasively in maternal whole blood. This computational approach circumvented a major limitation, the abundance of maternal proteins interfering with the detection of fetal proteins, to fetal proteomic analysis of maternal blood. Computational models can use fetal gene transcripts previously identified in maternal whole blood to create a comprehensive proteomic network of the term neonate. Such work shows that the fetal proteins detected in pregnant woman&#x27;s blood originate from a diverse group of tissues and organs from the developing fetus. The proteomic networks contain many biomarkers that are proxies for development and illustrate the potential clinical application of this technology as a way to monitor normal and abnormal fetal development.

An information-theoretic framework has also been introduced for biomarker discovery, integrating biofluid and tissue information. This new approach takes advantage of functional synergy between certain biofluids and tissues with the potential for clinically significant findings not possible if tissues and biofluids were considered individually. By conceptualizing tissue-biofluid as information channels, significant biofluid proxies can be identified and then used for the guided development of clinical diagnostics. Candidate biomarkers are then predicted based on information transfer criteria across the tissue-biofluid channels. Significant biofluid-tissue relationships can be used to prioritize clinical validation of biomarkers.

==Emerging trends==
A number of emerging concepts have the potential to improve the current features of proteomics. Obtaining absolute quantification of proteins and monitoring post-translational modifications are the two tasks that impact the understanding of protein function in healthy and diseased cells. Further, the throughput and sensitivity of proteomic assays, often measured as samples analyzed per day and depth of proteome coverage, respectively, have driven development of cutting-edge instrumentation and methodologies. For many cellular events, the protein concentrations do not change; rather, their function is modulated by post-translational modifications (PTM). Methods of monitoring PTM are an underdeveloped area in proteomics. Selecting a particular subset of protein for analysis substantially reduces protein complexity, making it advantageous for diagnostic purposes where blood is the starting material. Another important aspect of proteomics, yet not addressed, is that proteomics methods should focus on studying proteins in the context of the environment. The increasing use of chemical cross-linkers, introduced into living cells to fix protein-protein, protein-DNA and other interactions, may ameliorate this problem partially. The challenge is to identify suitable methods of preserving relevant interactions. Another goal for studying proteins is development of more sophisticated methods to image proteins and other molecules in living cells and real-time.

=== Systems biology ===
Advances in quantitative proteomics would clearly enable more in-depth analysis of cellular systems. Another research frontier is the analysis of single cells, and protein covariation across single cells which reflects biological processes such as protein complex formation, immune functions, as well as cell cycle and priming of cancer cells for drug resistance Biological systems are subject to a variety of perturbations (cell cycle, cellular differentiation, carcinogenesis, environment (biophysical), etc.). Transcriptional and translational responses to these perturbations results in functional changes to the proteome implicated in response to the stimulus. Therefore, describing and quantifying proteome-wide changes in protein abundance is crucial towards understanding biological phenomenon more holistically, on the level of the entire system. In this way, proteomics can be seen as complementary to genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, metabolomics, and other -omics approaches in integrative analyses attempting to define biological phenotypes more comprehensively. As an example, &quot;The Cancer Proteome Atlas&quot; provides quantitative protein expression data for ~200 proteins in over 4,000 tumor samples with matched transcriptomic and genomic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Similar datasets in other cell types, tissue types, and species, particularly using deep shotgun mass spectrometry, will be an immensely important resource for research in fields like cancer biology, developmental and stem cell biology, medicine, and evolutionary biology.

===Human plasma proteome===
Characterizing the human plasma proteome has become a major goal in the proteomics arena, but it is also the most challenging proteomes of all human tissues. It contains immunoglobulin, cytokines, protein hormones, and secreted proteins indicative of infection on top of resident, hemostatic proteins. It also contains tissue leakage proteins due to the blood circulation through different tissues in the body. The blood thus contains information on the physiological state of all tissues and, combined with its accessibility, makes the blood proteome invaluable for medical purposes. It is thought that characterizing the proteome of blood plasma is a daunting challenge.

The depth of the plasma proteome encompasses a dynamic range of more than 1010 between the highest abundant protein (albumin) and the lowest (some cytokines) and is thought to be one of the main challenges for proteomics. Temporal and spatial dynamics further complicate the study of human plasma proteome. The turnover of some proteins is quite faster than others and the protein content of an artery may substantially vary from that of a vein. All these differences make even the simplest proteomic task of cataloging the proteome seem out of reach. To tackle this problem, priorities need to be established. Capturing the most meaningful subset of proteins among the entire proteome to generate a diagnostic tool is one such priority. Secondly, since cancer is associated with enhanced glycosylation of proteins, methods that focus on this part of proteins will also be useful. Again: multiparameter analysis best reveals a pathological state. As these technologies improve, the disease profiles should be continually related to respective gene expression changes. Due to the above-mentioned problems plasma proteomics remained challenging. However, technological advancements and continuous developments seem to result in a revival of plasma proteomics as it was shown recently by a technology called plasma proteome profiling. Due to such technologies researchers were able to investigate inflammation processes in mice, the heritability of plasma proteomes as well as to show the effect of such a common life style change like weight loss on the plasma proteome.

<doc id="55174" wikidata="Q185802" url="?curid=55174" title="Falun Gong">
<text>Falun Gong or Falun Dafa is a new religious movement founded by its leader Li Hongzhi in China in the early 1990s. Falun Gong has its global headquarters in Dragon Springs, a compound in Deerpark, New York, United States, near the residence of Li Hongzhi.

Led by Li Hongzhi, who is viewed by adherents as a deity-like figure, Falun Gong practitioners operate a variety of organizations in the United States and elsewhere, including the dance troupe Shen Yun. They are known for their opposition to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), espousing anti-evolutionary views, opposition to homosexuality and feminism, and rejection of modern medicine, among other views described as &quot;ultra-conservative&quot;.

The Falun Gong also operates the Epoch Media Group, which is known for its subsidiaries, New Tang Dynasty Television and &quot;The Epoch Times&quot; newspaper. The latter has been broadly noted as a politically far-right media entity, and it has received significant attention in the United States for promoting conspiracy theories, such as QAnon and anti-vaccine misinformation, and producing advertisements for U.S. President Donald Trump. It has also drawn attention in Europe for promoting far-right politicians, primarily in France and Germany.

Falun Gong emerged from the qigong movement in China in 1992, combining meditation, qigong exercises, and moral teachings rooted in Buddhist and Taoist traditions. While supported by some government agencies, Falun Gong&#x27;s rapid growth and independence from state control led several top officials to perceive it as a threat, resulting in periodic acts of harassment in the late 1990s. On 25 April 1999, over 10,000 Falun Gong practitioners gathered peacefully outside the central government compound in Beijing, seeking official recognition of the right to practice their faith without interference.

In July 1999, the government of China implemented a ban on Falun Gong, categorizing it as an &quot;illegal organization&quot;. Mass arrests, widespread torture and abuses followed. In 2008, U.S. government reports cited estimates that as much as half of China&#x27;s labor camp population was made up of Falun Gong practitioners. In 2009, human rights groups estimated that at least 2,000 Falun Gong practitioners had died from persecution by that time. A 2022 United States Department of State report on religious freedom in China stated that &quot;Falun Gong practitioners reported societal discrimination in employment, housing, and business opportunities&quot;. According to the same report: &quot;Prior to the government&#x27;s 1999 ban on Falun Gong, the government [of China] estimated there were 70 million adherents. Falun Gong sources estimate that tens of millions continue to practice privately, and Freedom House estimates there are seven to 20 million practitioners.&quot;

==Beliefs and practices==

Falun Gong is entirely based around the teachings of its autocratic founder and leader: China-born Li Hongzhi. According to &quot;NBC News&quot;, to his followers, Li is &quot;a God-like figure who can levitate, walk through walls and see into the future. His ultra-conservative and controversial teachings include a rejection of modern science, art and medicine, and a denunciation of homosexuality, feminism and general worldliness.&quot; Hongzhi instructs his followers to downplay his controversial teachings when speaking to outsiders.

===Central teachings===
According to the Falun Gong, the Falun Gong aspires to enable the practitioner to ascend spiritually through moral rectitude and the practice of a set of exercises and meditation. The three stated tenets of the belief are truthfulness (), compassion (), and forbearance (). These principles have been repeated by Falun Gong members to outsiders as a tactic for evading deeper inquiry, and followers have been instructed by Li to lie about the practice. Together these principles are regarded as the fundamental nature of the cosmos, the criteria for differentiating right from wrong, and are held to be the highest manifestations of the Tao. Adherence to and cultivation of these virtues is regarded as a fundamental part of Falun Gong practice. In Zhuan Falun (), the foundational text published in 1995, Li Hongzhi writes &quot;It doesn&#x27;t matter how mankind&#x27;s moral standard changes[...] The nature of the cosmos doesn&#x27;t change, and it is the only standard for determining who&#x27;s good and who&#x27;s bad. So to be a cultivator you have to take the nature of the cosmos as your guide for improving yourself.&quot;

Practice of Falun Gong consists of two features: performance of the exercises, and the refinement of one&#x27;s (moral character, temperament). In Falun Gong&#x27;s central text, Li states that &quot;includes virtue (which is a type of matter), it includes forbearance, it includes awakening to things, it includes giving up things—giving up all the desires and all the attachments that are found in an ordinary person—and you also have to endure hardship, to name just a few things.&quot; The elevation of one&#x27;s moral character is achieved, on the one hand, by aligning one&#x27;s life with truth, compassion, and tolerance; and on the other, by abandoning desires and &quot;negative thoughts and behaviors, such as greed, profit, lust, desire, killing, fighting, theft, robbery, deception, jealousy, etc.&quot;

Among the central concepts found in the teachings of Falun Gong is the existence of &#x27;Virtue&#x27; () and &#x27;Karma&#x27; (). The former is generated through doing good deeds and suffering, while the latter is accumulated through doing wrong deeds. A person&#x27;s ratio of karma to virtue is said to determine their fortunes in this life or the next. While virtue engenders good fortune and enables spiritual transformation, an accumulation of karma results in suffering, illness, and alienation from the nature of the universe. Spiritual elevation is achieved through the elimination of negative karma and the accumulation of virtue. Practitioners believe that through a process of moral cultivation, one can achieve Tao and obtain special powers and a level of divinity.

Falun Gong&#x27;s teachings posit that human beings are originally and innately good—even divine—but that they descended into a realm of delusion and suffering after developing selfishness and accruing karma. The practice holds that reincarnation exists, with the cycle of rebirth shaped by the accumulation of karma—a concept somewhat analogous to the Christian notion of &quot;reaping what one sows.&quot; This perspective helps explain the perceived unfairness of differences among individuals, such as between the rich and the poor, while also encouraging moral behavior despite these inequalities. To re-ascend and return to the &quot;original, true self&quot;, Falun Gong practitioners are supposed to assimilate themselves to the qualities of truthfulness, compassion and tolerance, let go of &quot;attachments and desires&quot; and suffer to repay karma.

Traditional Chinese cultural thought and opposition to modernity are two focuses of Li Hongzhi&#x27;s teachings. Falun Gong echoes traditional Chinese beliefs that humans are connected to the universe through mind and body, and Li seeks to challenge &quot;conventional mentalities&quot;, concerning the nature and genesis of the universe, time-space, and the human body. The practice draws on East Asian mysticism and traditional Chinese medicine, but claims to have the power to heal incurable illnesses. Falun Gong describes modern science as too limited, and views traditional Chinese research and practice as valid.

Li says that he is a being who has come to help humankind from the destruction it could face as the result of rampant evil. When asked if he was a human being, Li replied &quot;You can think of me as a human being.&quot; According to the founder Li in his book, &quot;Zhuan Falun&quot;, he claims to have cultivated supernatural powers starting at age eight. According to Radio France International, &quot;Zhuan Falun&quot; also promises to teach practitioners to cultivate supernatural powers such as &quot;see[ing] through a wall or into a human body&quot;.

===Exercises===

In addition to its moral philosophy, Falun Gong consists of four standing exercises and one sitting meditation. The exercises are regarded as secondary to moral elevation, though are still an essential component of Falun Gong cultivation practice.

The first exercises, called &quot;Buddha Stretching a Thousand Arms&quot;, are intended to facilitate the free flow of energy through the body and open up the meridians. The second exercise, &quot;Falun Standing Stance&quot;, involves holding four static poses—each of which resembles holding a wheel—for an extended period. The objective of this exercise is to &quot;enhances wisdom, increases strength, raises a person&#x27;s level, and strengthens divine powers&quot;. The third, &quot;Penetrating the Cosmic Extremes&quot;, involves three sets of movements, which aim to enable the expulsion of bad energy (e.g., pathogenic or black ) and the absorption of good energy into the body. Through practice of this exercise, the practitioner aspires to cleanse and purify the body. The fourth exercise, &quot;Falun Cosmic Orbit&quot;, seeks to circulate energy freely throughout the body. Unlike the first through fourth exercises, the fifth exercise is performed in the seated lotus position. Called &quot;Reinforcing Supernatural Powers&quot;, it is a meditation intended to be maintained as long as possible.

Falun Gong exercises can be practiced individually or in group settings, and can be performed for varying lengths of time in accordance with the needs and abilities of the individual practitioner. Porter writes that practitioners of Falun Gong are encouraged to read Falun Gong books and practice its exercises on a regular basis, preferably daily. Falun Gong exercises are practiced in group settings in parks, university campuses, and other public spaces in over 70 countries worldwide, and are taught for free by volunteers. In addition to five exercises, in 2001 another meditation activity was introduced called &quot;sending righteous thoughts&quot;, which is intended to reduce persecution on the spiritual plane.

Discussions of supernatural skills also feature prominently within the movement, and the existence of these skills gained a level of mainstream acceptance in China&#x27;s scientific community in the 1980s.Falun Gong&#x27;s teachings hold that practitioners can acquire supernatural skills through a combination of moral cultivation, meditation and exercises. These include—but are not limited to—precognition, clairaudience, telepathy, and divine sight (via the opening of the third eye or celestial eye). However, Falun Gong stresses that these powers can be developed only as a result of moral practice, and should not be pursued or casually displayed. According to David Ownby, Falun Gong teaches that &quot;pride in one&#x27;s abilities, or the desire to show off, are marks of dangerous attachments&quot;, and Li warns his followers not to be distracted by the pursuit of such powers.

===Social practices===

Falun Gong differentiates itself from Buddhist monastic traditions in that it places great importance on participation in the secular world. Falun Gong practitioners are required to maintain regular jobs and family lives, to observe the laws of their respective governments, and are instructed not to distance themselves from society. An exception is made for Buddhist Bhikkhus and Bhikkhunīs, who are permitted to continue a monastic lifestyle while practicing Falun Gong.

As part of its emphasis on ethical behavior, Falun Gong&#x27;s teachings prescribe a strict personal morality for practitioners. They are expected to do good deeds, and conduct themselves with patience and forbearance when encountering difficulties. For instance, Li stipulates that a practitioner of Falun Gong must &quot;not hit back when attacked, not talk back when insulted.&quot; In addition, they must &quot;abandon negative thoughts and behaviors&quot;, such as greed, deception, jealousy, etc. The teachings contain injunctions against smoking and the consumption of alcohol, as these are considered addictions that are detrimental to health and mental clarity. Practitioners of Falun Gong are forbidden to kill living things—including animals for the purpose of obtaining food—though they are not required to adopt a vegetarian diet.

In addition to these things, practitioners of Falun Gong must abandon a variety of worldly attachments and desires. In the course of cultivation practice, the student of Falun Gong aims to relinquish the pursuit of fame, monetary gain, sentimentality, and other entanglements. Li&#x27;s teachings repeatedly emphasize the emptiness of material pursuits; although practitioners of Falun Gong are not encouraged to leave their jobs or eschew money, they are expected to give up the psychological attachments to these things.

Falun Gong doctrine counsels against participation in political or social issues. Excessive interest in politics is viewed as an attachment to worldly power and influence, and Falun Gong aims for transcendence of such pursuits. According to Hu Ping, &quot;Falun Gong deals only with purifying the individual through exercise, and does not touch on social or national concerns. It has not suggested or even intimated a model for social change. Many religions[...] pursue social reform to some extent[...] but there is no such tendency evident in Falun Gong.&quot;

Sexual desire and lust are treated as attachments to be discarded, though Falun Gong students are still generally expected to marry and have families. All sexual relations outside the confines of monogamous, heterosexual marriage are regarded as immoral.

Li Hongzhi taught that homosexuality makes one &quot;unworthy of being human&quot;, creates bad karma, and is comparable to organized crime. He also taught that &quot;disgusting homosexuality shows the dirty abnormal psychology of the gay who has lost his ability of reasoning&quot;, and that homosexuality is a &quot;filthy, deviant state of mind&quot;. Li additionally stated in a 1998 speech in Switzerland that the gods&#x27; &quot;first target of annihilation would be homosexuals&quot;. Although gay, lesbian, and bisexual people may practice Falun Gong, founder Li stated that they must &quot;give up the bad conduct&quot; of all same-sex sexual activity.

Falun Gong&#x27;s cosmology includes the belief that different ethnicities each have a correspondence to their own heavens, and that individuals of mixed race lose some aspect of this connection. Falun Gong&#x27;s teachings include belief in reincarnation and that one&#x27;s soul (original spirit) always maintains single racial identity despite having a body of mixed race. Investigative journalist Ethan Gutmann noted that interracial marriage is common in the Falun Gong community.

===Texts===
Li Hongzhi authored the first book of Falun Gong teachings in April 1993; titled &quot;China Falun Gong&quot;, or simply &quot;Falun Gong&quot;, it is an introductory text that discusses , Falun Gong&#x27;s relationship to Buddhism, the principles of cultivation practice, and the improvement of moral character (). The book also provides illustrations and explanations of the exercises and meditation.

The main body of teachings is articulated in the book &quot;Zhuan Falun&quot;, published in Chinese in January 1995. The book is divided into nine &quot;lectures&quot;, and was based on edited transcriptions of the talks Li gave throughout China in the preceding three years. Falun Gong texts have since been translated into an additional 40 languages. In addition to these central texts, Li has published several books, lectures, articles and books of poetry, which are made available on Falun Gong websites.

The Falun Gong teachings use numerous untranslated Chinese religious and philosophical terms, and make frequent allusion to characters and incidents in Chinese folk literature and concepts drawn from Chinese popular religion. This, coupled with the literal translation style of the texts, which imitate the colloquial style of Li&#x27;s speeches, can make Falun Gong scriptures difficult to approach for Westerners.

===Symbols===
The main symbol of the practice is the (Dharma wheel, or in Sanskrit). In Buddhism, the represents the completeness of the doctrine. To &quot;turn the wheel of dharma&quot; () means to preach the Buddhist doctrine, and is the title of Falun Gong&#x27;s main text. Despite the invocation of Buddhist language and symbols, the law wheel as understood in Falun Gong has distinct connotations, and is held to represent the universe. It is conceptualized by an emblem consisting of one large and four small (counter-clockwise) swastika symbols, representing the Buddha, and four small Taiji (yin-yang) symbols of the Daoist tradition.

===Dharma-ending period===
Li situates his teaching of Falun Gong amidst the &quot;Dharma-ending period&quot; (, ), described in Buddhist scriptures as an age of moral decline when the teachings of Buddhism would need to be rectified. The current era is described in Falun Gong&#x27;s teachings as the &quot; rectification&quot; period (, which might also be translated as &quot;to correct the dharma&quot;), a time of cosmic transition and renewal. The process of rectification is necessitated by the moral decline and degeneration of life in the universe, and in the post-1999 context, the persecution of Falun Gong by the Chinese government has come to be viewed as a tangible symptom of this moral decay. Through the process of the rectification, life will be reordered according to the moral and spiritual quality of each, with good people being saved and ascending to higher spiritual planes, and bad ones being eliminated or cast down. In this paradigm, Li assumes the role of rectifying the Dharma by disseminating through his moral teachings.

Some scholars, such as Maria Hsia Chang and Susan Palmer, have described Li&#x27;s rhetoric about the &quot; rectification&quot; and providing salvation &quot;in the final period of the Last Havoc&quot; as apocalyptic. However, Benjamin Penny, a professor of Chinese history at the Australian National University, argues that Li&#x27;s teachings are better understood in the context of a &quot;Buddhist notion of the cycle of the Dharma or the Buddhist law&quot;. Richard Gunde wrote that, unlike apocalyptic groups in the West, Falun Gong does not fixate on death or the end of the world, and instead &quot;has a simple, innocuous ethical message&quot;. Li Hongzhi does not discuss a &quot;time of reckoning&quot;, and has rejected predictions of an impending apocalypse in his teachings.

=== Extraterrestrials ===
Li in the 1990s repeated claims that aliens were responsible for scientific inventions through the manipulation of scientists. For example, in a 1999 interview with &quot;Time&quot;, Li attributed the invention of computers and airplanes to extraterrestrials, as well as war and violence. However, his position on aliens seemed fairly inconsistent to observers Graeme Lang and Lu Yunfeng. In the &quot;Time&quot; interview, Li believed that aliens were attempting to replace humans through a cloning process, in which human bodies would be cloned with no soul, so that the aliens can replace the soul and inhabit human bodies (which to him are perfect).

Li Hongzhi alleged that extraterrestrials disguise themselves as humans to corrupt and manipulate humanity. According to an ABC investigation, while some practitioners stated that this was metaphorical, a former member said she was taught it as literal truth.

==Categorization==
Scholars describe Falun Gong as a new religious movement. The organization is regularly featured in handbooks describing new religious movements. While commonly described by scholars as a new religious movement, adherents may reject this term. Yuezhi Zhao describes Falun Gong as &quot;a multifaceted and totalizing movement that means different things to different people, ranging from a set of physical exercises and a praxis of transformation to a moral philosophy and a new knowledge system.&quot;

In the cultural context of China, Falun Gong is generally described either as a system of qigong, or a type of &quot;cultivation practice&quot; (&quot;xiulian&quot;), a process by which an individual seeks spiritual perfection, often through both physical and moral conditioning. Varieties of cultivation practice are found throughout Chinese history, spanning Buddhist, Daoist, and Confucian traditions. Benjamin Penny writes &quot;the best way to describe Falun Gong is as a cultivation system. Cultivation systems have been a feature of Chinese life for at least 2,500 years.&quot; Qigong practices can also be understood as a part of a broader tradition of &quot;cultivation practice&quot;.

In the West, Falun Gong is frequently classified as a religion on the basis of its theological and moral teachings, its concerns with spiritual cultivation and transformation, and its extensive body of scripture. Falun Gong practitioners themselves have sometimes disavowed this classification, however. This rejection reflects the relatively narrow definition of &quot;religion&quot; in contemporary China. According to David Ownby, religion in China has been defined since 1912 to refer to &quot;world-historical faiths&quot; that have &quot;well-developed institutions, clergy, and textual traditions&quot;—namely, Buddhism, Daoism, Islam, Protestantism, and Catholicism. Moreover, if Falun Gong had described itself as a religion in China, it likely would have invited immediate suppression. These historical and cultural circumstances notwithstanding, the practice has often been described as a form of Chinese religion.

==Approaches to media: &quot;The Epoch Times&quot;, Shen Yun, and Wikipedia==

The performance arts group Shen Yun and the media organization &quot;The Epoch Times&quot; are the major outreach organizations of Falun Gong. Both promote the spiritual and political teachings of Falun Gong. They and a variety of other organizations such as New Tang Dynasty Television (NTD) operate as extensions of Falun Gong. These extensions promote the new religious movement and its teachings. In the case of &quot;The Epoch Times&quot;, they also promote conspiracy theories such as QAnon and anti-vaccine misinformation and far-right politics in both Europe and the United States. Around the time of the 2016 United States presidential election, &quot;The Epoch Times&quot; began running articles supportive of Donald Trump and critical of his opponents. Falun Gong extensions have also been active in promoting the European Radical right.

The exact financial and structural connections between Falun Gong, Shen Yun and &quot;The Epoch Times&quot; remains unclear. According to NBC News:
The Epoch Media Group, along with Shen Yun, a dance troupe known for its ubiquitous advertising and unsettling performances, make up the outreach effort of Falun Gong, a relatively new spiritual practice that combines ancient Chinese meditative exercises, mysticism and often ultraconservative cultural worldviews. Falun Gong&#x27;s founder has referred to Epoch Media Group as &quot;our media&quot;, and the group&#x27;s practice heavily informs &quot;The Epoch Times&quot;″ coverage, according to former employees who spoke with NBC News.

&quot;The Epoch Times&quot;, digital production company NTD and the heavily advertised dance troupe Shen Yun make up the nonprofit network that Li calls &quot;our media&quot;. Financial documents paint a complicated picture of more than a dozen technically separate organizations that appear to share missions, money and executives. Though the source of their revenue is unclear, the most recent financial records from each organization paint a picture of an overall business thriving in the Trump era.

According to scholar James R. Lewis writing in 2018, Falun Gong adherents have attempted to control English Wikipedia articles covering the group and articles related to it. Lewis highlights Falun Gong&#x27;s extensive internet presence, and how editors who have to date contributed to English Wikipedia entries associated with Falun Gong to the point where &quot;Falun Gong followers and/or sympathizers de facto control the relevant pages on Wikipedia&quot;, and how this is particularly important for Falun Gong as an organization due to the search engine optimization results of these entries, and how the entries can influence other media entities. Lewis notes also how this fits in as part of Falun Gong&#x27;s general media strategy, such as Falun Gong media like &quot;The Epoch Times&quot;, New Tang Dynasty, Sound of Hope Radio, and, as Lewis discusses, the Rachlin media group. Lewis reports that the Rachlin media group is the Falun Gong&#x27;s de facto PR firm operated by Gail Rachlin, spokesperson for the Falun Dafa Information Centre. Lewis says that Amnesty International does not independently verify its reports from Falun Gong groups, accepting material directly from Falun Gong organizations as fact. According to Lewis, &quot;[Falun Gong] has thus been able to influence other media via its presence on the web, through its direct press releases, and through its own media.&quot;

==Ultrasurf, Freegate, the Open Technology Fund, and whistleblower allegations==
In the early 2000s, Falun Gong adherents in the United States developed Ultrasurf and Freegate, freeware intended to circumvent Chinese government internet censorship. According to NPR:
:Adherents of Falun Gong first developed Ultrasurf nearly two decades ago to get around censors in China and elsewhere. Early on, Ultrasurf seemed a highly promising tool in aiding activists and journalists to talk securely online. It earlier received development money from the State Department and the predecessor agency to USAGM.

A Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society report on the circumvention landscape in 2007 found Ultrasurf&#x27;s performance to be &quot;the best of any tool tested in filtering countries, the only tool to display okay speed for both image heavy and simple, text oriented sites.&quot; A Wired article described Ultrasurf as &quot;one of the most important free-speech tools on the Internet, used by millions from China to Saudi Arabia.&quot;

Beyond China, Freegate gained popularity among Iranian protesters soon after its Farsi version was introduced in July 2008. During the Green Movement protests surrounding the 2009 election, its servers were overwhelmed by Iranian Internet users.

In 2010, the US State Department under the Obama administration offered a $1.5 million grant to the Global Internet Freedom Consortium founded by Falun Gong adherents that developed Ultrasurf and Freegate, drawing opposition from the Chinese government. A 2011 Center for a New American Security report recognized the need for the US government to fund high-performing technologies like Ultrasurf and Freegate, despite the stress it might cause on the U.S.-China relationship, but recommended the US government diversify the technologies it funds.

In recent years, Ultrasurf has been a major point of contention in large part because it is not open source, meaning that it cannot be reviewed by outside engineers for vulnerabilities and back doors. Additionally, as reported by &quot;The Verge&quot;, since the 2000s, the software has drawn criticism &quot;for its content filtering (which blocks pornography) and its ability to surveil user traffic, which is often impossible by design in competing tools&quot;.

Although it receives public funding, both its creators and owners have rejected attempts at allowing outside parties to review its effectiveness and utility. A 2020 audit by the U.S. State Department concluded that &quot;censoring Ultrasurf nation-wide would have been trivial for a moderate-budget adversary&quot;.

After conservative documentary filmmaker Michael Pack was appointed CEO of the U.S. Agency for Global Media during the Trump administration in 2020, Pack tied up $19 million in federal funds from other projects for the Ultrasurf project. Numerous other projects, including other secure communication projects, lost funding during this period. Ultrasoft eventually received $249,000 of the allotted funds. Once receiving funding, only &quot;four people abroad used it to access Voice of America and Radio Free Asia, a key purpose for its subsidy&quot; during December 2020 and January 2021.

Two days before U.S. President Joe Biden&#x27;s 2021 inauguration, Pack appointed a columnist from the &quot;Epoch Times&quot; to the board of directors for the networks his agency oversaw. This columnist had claimed the January 6 insurrection was a &quot;false flag operation&quot;. During his eight months in office, Pack regularly appeared in the &quot;Epoch Times&quot;, where he also discussed Ultrasurf.

As of 2020, Pack, along with other USAGM officials he did not fire during his time there, faced a criminal inquiry in response to whistleblower allegations that the &quot;concerted effort to divert funds to the Falun Gong software Ultrasurf was a criminal conspiracy&quot;.

==Organization==

Spiritual authority is vested exclusively in the teachings of founder Li Hongzhi. Volunteer &quot;assistants&quot; or &quot;contact persons&quot; do not hold authority over other practitioners, regardless of how long they have practiced Falun Gong. Li stipulates that practitioners of Falun Gong cannot collect money or charge fees, conduct healings, or teach or interpret doctrine for others. There is no system of membership within the practice and no rituals of worship. Falun Gong operates through a global, networked, and largely virtual online community. In particular, electronic communications, email lists and a collection of websites are the primary means of coordinating activities and disseminating Li Hongzhi&#x27;s teachings.

Outside Mainland China, the organisation stated that they have followers in more than 100 countries. Li Hongzhi&#x27;s teachings are principally spread through the Internet. In most mid- to large-sized cities, Falun Gong practitioners organize regular group meditation or study sessions in which they practice Falun Gong exercises and read Li Hongzhi&#x27;s writings. The exercise and meditation sessions are described as informal groups of practitioners who gather in public parks—usually in the morning—for one to two hours. Group study sessions typically take place in the evenings in private residences or university or high school classrooms, and are described by David Ownby as &quot;the closest thing to a regular &#x27;congregational experience that Falun Gong offers. Individuals who are too busy, isolated, or who simply prefer solitude may elect to practice privately. When there are expenses to be covered (such as for the rental of facilities for large-scale conferences), costs are borne by self-nominated and relatively affluent individual members of the community.

===Within China===

In 1993, the Beijing-based Falun Dafa Research Society was accepted as a branch of the state-run China Qigong Research Society (CQRS), which oversaw the administration of the country&#x27;s various qigong schools, and sponsored activities and seminars. As per the requirements of the CQRS, Falun Gong was organized into a nationwide network of assistance centers, &quot;main stations&quot;, &quot;branches&quot;, &quot;guidance stations&quot;, and local practice sites, mirroring the structure of the qigong society or even of the CCP itself. Falun Gong assistants were self-selecting volunteers who taught the exercises, organized events, and disseminated new writings from Li Hongzhi. The Falun Dafa Research Society provided advice to students on meditation techniques, translation services, and coordination for the practice nationwide.

Following its departure from the CQRS in 1996, Falun Gong came under increased scrutiny from authorities and responded by adopting a more decentralized and loose organizational structure. In 1997, the Falun Dafa Research Society was formally dissolved, along with the regional &quot;main stations&quot;. Yet practitioners continued to organize themselves at local levels, being connected through electronic communications, interpersonal networks and group exercise sites. Both Falun Gong sources and Chinese government sources claimed that there were some 1,900 &quot;guidance stations&quot; and 28,263 local Falun Gong exercise sites nationwide by 1999, though they disagree over the extent of vertical coordination among these organizational units. In response to the persecution that began in 1999, Falun Gong was driven underground, the organizational structure grew yet more informal within China, and the internet took precedence as a means of connecting practitioners.

Following the persecution of Falun Gong in 1999, Chinese authorities sought to portray Falun Gong as a hierarchical and well-funded organization. James Tong writes that it was in the government&#x27;s interest to portray Falun Gong as highly organized in order to justify its repression of the group: &quot;The more organized the Falun Gong could be shown to be, then the more justified the regime&#x27;s repression in the name of social order was.&quot; He concluded that Party&#x27;s claims lacked &quot;both internal and external substantiating evidence&quot;, and that despite the arrests and scrutiny, the authorities never &quot;credibly countered Falun Gong rebuttals&quot;.

===Dragon Springs compound===
Falun Gong operates out of Dragon Springs, a compound located in Deerpark, New York. Falun Gong founder and leader Li Hongzhi resides near the compound, along with &quot;hundreds&quot; of Falun Gong adherents. Members of Falun Gong extension Shen Yun live and rehearse in the compound, which also contains schools and temples. The compound is registered as a church, Dragon Springs Buddhist, which gives it tax exemptions and greater privacy. Scholar Andrew Junker noted that in 2019, near Dragon Springs, in Middletown, was an office for the Falun Gong media extension &quot;The Epoch Times&quot;, which published a special local edition.

The compound has been a point of controversy among former residents. According to NBC News:
[F]our former compound residents and former Falun Gong practitioners who spoke to NBC News... said that life in Dragon Springs is tightly controlled by Li, that internet access is restricted, the use of medicines is discouraged, and arranged relationships are common. Two former residents on visas said they were offered to be set up with U.S. residents at the compound.

Tiger Huang, a former Dragon Springs resident who was on a United States student visa from Taiwan, said she was set up on three dates on the compound, and she believed her ability to stay in the United States was tied to the arrangement.

&quot;The purpose of setting up the dates was obvious&quot;, Huang said. Her now-husband, a former Dragon Springs resident, confirmed the account. Huang said she was told by Dragon Springs officials her visa had expired and was told to go back to Taiwan after months of dating a nonpractitioner in the compound. She later learned that her visa had not expired when she was told to leave the country.

Acquired by Falun Gong in 2000, the site is closed to visitors and features guarded gates, has been a point of contention for some Deer Park residents concerned. In 2019, Falun Gong requested to expand the site, wishing to add a 920-seat concert hall, a new parking garage, a wastewater treatment plant and a conversion of meditation space into residential space large enough to bring the total residential capacity to 500 people. These plans met with opposition from the Delaware Riverkeeper Network regarding the wastewater treatment facility and the elimination of local wetlands, impacting local waterways such as the Basher Kill and Neversink River. Local residents opposed the expansion because it would increase traffic and reduce the rural character of the area. Falun Gong adherents living in the area have claimed that they have experienced discrimination from local residents.

After visiting in 2019, Junker noted that &quot;the secrecy of Dragon Springs was obvious and a source of tension for the town.&quot; Junker adds that, Dragon Springs&#x27;s website says its restricted access is for security reasons, and that the site claims the compound contains orphans and refugees.

==Demography==
Prior to July 1999, official Chinese government estimates placed the number of Falun Gong practitioners at 70 million nationwide, rivalling membership in the CCP. By the time of the persecution on 22 July 1999, most Chinese government numbers said the population of Falun Gong was between 2 and 3 million, though some publications maintained an estimate of 40 million. The Falun Gong organization estimated in the same period that the total number of practitioners in China was between 70 and 80 million, though sociologist David A. Palmer notes these numbers were likely highly inflated and gives a more reasonable estimate of 10 million. Other sources have estimated the Falun Gong population in China to have peaked between 10 and 70 million practitioners. The number of Falun Gong practitioners still practicing in China today is difficult to confirm, though Freedom House estimates that seven to 20 million continue to practice privately.

Demographic surveys conducted in China in 1998 found a population that was mostly female and elderly. Of 34,351 Falun Gong practitioners surveyed, 27% were male and 73% female. Only 38% were under 50 years old. Falun Gong attracted a range of other individuals, from young college students to bureaucrats, intellectuals and Party officials. Surveys in China from the 1990s found that between 23 and 40% of practitioners held university degrees at the college or graduate level—several times higher than the general population.

Falun Gong is practiced by tens, and possibly hundreds, of thousands outside China, with the largest communities found in Taiwan and North American cities with large Chinese populations, such as New York and Toronto. Demographic surveys by Palmer and Ownby in these communities found that 90% of practitioners are ethnic Chinese. The average age was approximately 40. Among survey respondents, 56% were female and 44% male; 80% were married. The surveys found the respondents to be highly educated: 9% held PhDs, 34% had master&#x27;s degrees, and 24% had a bachelor&#x27;s degree.

As of 2008, the most commonly reported reasons for being attracted to Falun Gong were intellectual content, cultivation exercises, and health benefits. Non-Chinese Falun Gong practitioners tend to fit the profile of &quot;spiritual seekers&quot;—people who had tried a variety of qigong, yoga, or religious practices before finding Falun Gong. According to sociologist Richard Madsen, who specializes in studying modern Chinese culture, Chinese scientists with doctorates from prestigious American universities who practice Falun Gong claim that modern physics (for example, superstring theory) and biology (specifically the pineal gland&#x27;s function) provide a scientific basis for their beliefs. From their point of view, &quot;Falun Dafa is knowledge rather than religion, a new form of science rather than faith&quot;.

==History inside China==
===1992–1996===
Li Hongzhi introduced Falun Gong to the public on 13 May 1992, in Changchun, Jilin Province. Several months later, in September 1992, Falun Gong was admitted as a branch of qigong under the administration of the state-run China Qigong Scientific Research Society (CQRS). Li was recognized as a qigong master, and was authorized to teach his practice nationwide. Like many &quot;qigong&quot; masters at the time, Li toured major cities in China from 1992 to 1994 to teach the practice. He was granted a number of awards by PRC governmental organizations.

According to David Ownby, Professor of History and Director of the Center for East Asian Studies at the Université de Montréal, Li became an &quot;instant star of the qigong movement&quot;, and Falun Gong was embraced by the government as an effective means of lowering health care costs, promoting Chinese culture, and improving public morality. In December 1992, for instance, Li and several Falun Gong students participated in the Asian Health Expo in Beijing, where he reportedly &quot;received the most praise [of any qigong school] at the fair, and achieved very good therapeutic results&quot;, according to the fair&#x27;s organizer. The event helped cement Li&#x27;s popularity, and journalistic reports of Falun Gong&#x27;s healing powers spread. In 1993, Li received a letter of appreciation from the Ministry of Public Security for providing treatment to around 100 police officers injured while on duty.

Falun Gong had differentiated itself from other &quot;qigong&quot; groups in its emphasis on morality, low cost, and health benefits. It rapidly spread via word-of-mouth, attracting a wide range of practitioners from all walks of life, including numerous members of the Chinese Communist Party.

From 1992 to 1994, Li did charge fees for the seminars he was giving across China, though the fees were considerably lower than those of competing qigong practices, and the local qigong associations received a substantial share. Li justified the fees as being necessary to cover travel costs and other expenses, and on some occasions, he donated the money earned to charitable causes. In 1994, Li ceased charging fees altogether, thereafter stipulating that Falun Gong must always be taught for free, and its teachings made available without charge (including online). Although some observers believe Li continued to earn substantial income through the sale of Falun Gong books, others dispute this, asserting that most Falun Gong books in circulation were bootleg copies.

With the publication of the books &quot;Falun Gong&quot; and &quot;Zhuan Falun&quot;, Li made his teachings more widely accessible. &quot;Zhuan Falun&quot;, published in January 1995 at an unveiling ceremony held in the auditorium of the Ministry of Public Security, became a best-seller in China.

In 1995, Chinese authorities began looking to Falun Gong to solidify its organizational structure and ties to the party-state. Li was approached by the Chinese National Sports Committee, Ministry of Public Health, and China Qigong Science Research Association (CQRS) to jointly establish a Falun Gong association. Li declined the offer. The same year, the CQRS issued a new regulation mandating that all qigong denominations establish a Chinese Communist Party branch. Li again refused.

Tensions continued to mount between Li and the CQRS in 1996. In the face of Falun Gong&#x27;s rise in popularity—a large part of which was attributed to its low cost—competing &quot;qigong&quot; masters accused Li of undercutting them. According to Schechter, the &quot;qigong&quot; society under which Li and other &quot;qigong&quot; masters belonged asked Li to hike his tuition, but Li emphasized the need for the teachings to be free of charge.

In March 1996, Falun Gong withdrew from the CQRS in response to mounting disagreements, after which time it operated outside the official sanction of the state. Falun Gong representatives attempted to register with other government entities, but were rebuffed. Li and Falun Gong were then outside the circuit of personal relations and financial exchanges through which masters and their &quot;qigong&quot; organizations could find a place within the state system, and also the protections this afforded.

===1996–1999===
Falun Gong&#x27;s departure from the state-run CQRS corresponded to a wider shift in the government&#x27;s attitudes towards qigong practices. As qigong&#x27;s detractors in government grew more influential, authorities began attempting to rein in the growth and influence of these groups, some of which had amassed tens of millions of followers. In the mid-1990s the state-run media began publishing articles critical of qigong.

Falun Gong was initially shielded from the mounting criticism, but following its withdrawal from the CQRS in March 1996, it lost this protection. On 17 June 1996, the &quot;Guangming Daily&quot;, an influential state-run newspaper, published a polemic against Falun Gong in which its central text, &quot;Zhuan Falun&quot;, was described as an example of &quot;feudal superstition&quot;. The author wrote that the history of humanity is a &quot;struggle between science and superstition&quot;, and called on Chinese publishers not to print &quot;pseudo-scientific books of the swindlers&quot;. The article was followed by at least twenty more in newspapers nationwide. Soon after, on 24 July, the Central Propaganda Department banned all publication of Falun Gong books (though the ban was not consistently enforced). The state-administered Buddhist Association of China also began issuing criticisms of Falun Gong, urging lay Buddhists not to take up the practice.

The events were an important challenge to Falun Gong, and one that practitioners did not take lightly. Thousands of Falun Gong followers wrote to &quot;Guangming Daily&quot; and to the CQRS to complain against the measures, claiming that they violated Hu Yaobang&#x27;s 1982 &#x27;Triple No&#x27; directive, which prohibited the media from either encouraging or criticizing qigong practices. In other instances, Falun Gong practitioners staged peaceful demonstrations outside media or local government offices to request retractions of perceived unfair coverage.

The polemics against Falun Gong were part of a larger movement opposing qigong organizations in the state-run media. Although Falun Gong was not the only target of the media criticism, nor the only group to protest, theirs was the most mobilized and steadfast response. Many of Falun Gong&#x27;s protests against negative media portrayals were successful, resulting in the retraction of several newspaper stories critical of the practice. This contributed to practitioners&#x27; belief that the media claims against them were false or exaggerated, and that their stance was justified.

In June 1998, He Zuoxiu, an outspoken critic of qigong and a fierce defender of Marxism, appeared on a talk show on Beijing Television and openly disparaged &quot;qigong&quot; groups, making particular mention of Falun Gong. Falun Gong practitioners responded with peaceful protests and by lobbying the station for a retraction. The reporter responsible for the program was reportedly fired, and a program favorable to Falun Gong was aired several days later. Falun Gong practitioners also mounted demonstrations at 14 other media outlets.

In 1997, The Ministry of Public Security launched an investigation into whether Falun Gong should be deemed xie jiao (, &quot;heretical teaching&quot;). The report concluded that &quot;no evidence has appeared thus far&quot;. The following year, however, on 21 July 1998, the Ministry of Public Security issued Document No. 555, &quot;Notice of the Investigation of Falun Gong&quot;. The document asserted that Falun Gong is a &quot;heretical teaching&quot;, and mandated that another investigation be launched to seek evidence in support of the conclusion. Falun Gong practitioners reported having phone lines tapped, homes ransacked and raided, and Falun Gong exercise sites disrupted by public security agents.

In this time period, even as criticism of qigong and Falun Gong mounted in some circles, the practice maintained a number of high-profile supporters in the government. In 1998, Qiao Shi, the recently retired Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress, initiated his own investigation into Falun Gong. After months of investigations, his group concluded that &quot;Falun Gong has hundreds of benefits for the Chinese people and China, and does not have one single bad effect.&quot; In May of the same year, China&#x27;s National Sports Commission launched its own survey of Falun Gong. Based on interviews with over 12,000 Falun Gong practitioners in Guangdong province, they stated that they were &quot;convinced the exercises and effects of Falun Gong are excellent. It has done an extraordinary amount to improve society&#x27;s stability and ethics.&quot;

The practice&#x27;s founder, Li Hongzhi, was largely absent from the country during the period of rising tensions with the government. In March 1995, Li had left China to first teach his practice in France and then other countries, and in 1998 obtained permanent residency in the United States.

By 1999, estimates provided by the State Sports Commission suggested there were 70 million Falun Gong practitioners in China. An anonymous employee of China&#x27;s National Sports Commission, was at this time quoted in an interview with U.S. News &amp; World Report as speculating that if 100 million had taken up Falun Gong and other forms of qigong there would be a dramatic reduction of health care costs and that &quot;Premier Zhu Rongji is very happy about that.&quot;

===Tianjin and Zhongnanhai protests===
By the late 1990s, the Chinese government&#x27;s relationship to the growing Falun Gong movement had become increasingly tense. Reports of discrimination and surveillance by the Public Security Bureau were escalating, and Falun Gong practitioners were routinely organizing sit-in demonstrations responding to media articles they deemed to be unfair. The conflicting investigations launched by the Ministry of the Public Security on one side and the State Sports Commission and Qiao Shi on the other spoke of the disagreements among China&#x27;s elites on how to regard the growing practice.

In April 1999, an article critical of Falun Gong was published in Tianjin Normal University&#x27;s &quot;Youth Reader&quot; magazine. The article was authored by physicist He Zuoxiu who, as Porter and Gutmann indicate, is a relative of Politburo member and public security secretary Luo Gan. The article cast qigong, and Falun Gong in particular, as superstitious and harmful for youth. Falun Gong practitioners responded by picketing the offices of the newspaper requesting a retraction of the article. Unlike past instances in which Falun Gong protests were successful, on 22 April the Tianjin demonstration was broken up by the arrival of three hundred riot police. Some of the practitioners were beaten, and forty-five arrested. Other Falun Gong practitioners were told that if they wished to appeal further, they needed to take the issue up with the Ministry of Public Security and go to Beijing to appeal.

The Falun Gong community quickly mobilized a response, and on the morning of 25 April, upwards of 10,000 practitioners gathered near the central appeals office to demand an end to the escalating harassment against the movement, and request the release of the Tianjin practitioners. According to Benjamin Penny, practitioners sought redress from the leadership of the country by going to them and, &quot;albeit very quietly and politely, making it clear that they would not be treated so shabbily.&quot; They sat or read quietly on the sidewalks surrounding the Zhongnanhai.

Five Falun Gong representatives met with Premier Zhu Rongji and other senior officials to negotiate a resolution. The Falun Gong representatives were assured that the regime supported physical exercises for health improvements and did not consider the Falun Gong to be anti-government.

President Jiang Zemin was alerted to the demonstration by Secretary of the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission Luo Gan, and was reportedly angered by the audacity of the demonstration—the largest since the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre. Jiang called for resolute action to suppress the group, and reportedly criticized Premier Zhu for being &quot;too soft&quot; in his handling of the situation. That evening, Jiang composed a letter indicating his desire to see Falun Gong &quot;defeated&quot;. In the letter, Jiang expressed concerns over the size and popularity of Falun Gong, and in particular about the large number of senior CCP members found among Falun Gong practitioners. He believed it possible foreign forces were behind Falun Gong&#x27;s protests (the practice&#x27;s founder, Li Hongzhi, had emigrated to the United States), and expressed concern about their use of the internet to coordinate a large-scale demonstration. Jiang also intimated that Falun Gong&#x27;s moral philosophy was at odds with the atheist values of Marxist–Leninism, and therefore constituted a form of ideological competition.

Jiang is held by Falun Gong to be personally responsible for this decision to persecute Falun Gong. Peerman cited reasons such as suspected personal jealousy of Li Hongzhi; Saich points to Jiang&#x27;s anger at Falun Gong&#x27;s widespread appeal, and ideological struggle as causes for the crackdown that followed. Willy Wo-Lap Lam suggests Jiang&#x27;s decision to suppress Falun Gong was related to a desire to consolidate his power within the Politburo. According to Human Rights Watch, senior officials were far from unified in their support for the crackdown.

==Persecution==

On 20 July 1999, security forces abducted and detained thousands of Falun Gong practitioners who they identified as leaders. Two days later, on 22 July, the PRC Ministry of Civil Affairs outlawed the Falun Dafa Research Society as an illegal organization that was &quot;engaged in illegal activities, advocating superstition and spreading fallacies, hoodwinking people, inciting and creating disturbances, and jeopardizing social stability&quot;. The same day, the Ministry of Public Security issued a circular forbidding citizens from practicing Falun Gong in groups, possessing Falun Gong&#x27;s teachings, displaying Falun Gong banners or symbols, or protesting against the ban.

The aim of the ensuing campaign was to &quot;eradicate&quot; the group through a combination of means which included the publication and distribution of propaganda which denounced it and the imprisonment and coercive thought reform of its practitioners, sometimes resulting in deaths. In October 1999, four months after the imposition of the ban, legislation was passed in order to outlaw &quot;heterodox religions&quot; and sentence Falun Gong devotees to prison terms.

Hundreds of thousands of Falun Gong practitioners are estimated to have been extrajudicially imprisoned, and practitioners who are currently in detention are reportedly subjected to forced labor, psychiatric abuse, torture, and other coercive methods of thought reform at the hands of Chinese authorities. The U.S. Department of State and Congressional-Executive Commission on China cite estimates that as much as half of China&#x27;s reeducation-through-labor camp population is made up of Falun Gong practitioners. Researcher Ethan Gutmann estimates that Falun Gong practitioners represent an average of 15 to 20 percent of the total &quot;laogai&quot; population, a population which includes practitioners who are currently being held in re-education through labor camps as well as practitioners who are currently being held in prisons and other forms of administrative detention. Former detainees of the labor camp system have reported that Falun Gong practitioners comprise one of the largest groups of prisoners; in some labor camp and prison facilities, they comprise the majority of the detainees, and they are often said to receive the longest sentences and the worst treatment. A 2013 report on labor reeducation camps by Amnesty International found that in some cases, Falun Gong practitioners &quot;constituted on average from one third to 100 per cent of the total population&quot; of certain camps.

According to Johnson, the campaign against Falun Gong extends to many aspects of society, including the media apparatus, the police force, the military, the education system, and workplaces. An extra-constitutional body, the &quot;610 Office&quot; was created to &quot;oversee&quot; the effort. Human Rights Watch (2002) commented that families and workplace employees were urged to cooperate with the government.

===Causes===
Observers have attempted to explain the Party&#x27;s rationale for banning Falun Gong as stemming from a variety of factors. Many of these explanations centre on institutional causes, such as Falun Gong&#x27;s size and popularity, its independence from the state, and internal politics within the Chinese government. Other scholars have noted that Chinese authorities were troubled by Falun Gong&#x27;s moral and spiritual content, which put it at odds with aspects of the official Marxist ideology. Still others have pointed to China&#x27;s history of bloody sectarian revolts as a possible factor leading to the crackdown.
Xinhua News Agency, the official news organization of the Chinese government, declared that Falun Gong is &quot;opposed to the Communist Party of China and the central government, preaches idealism, theism and feudal superstition.&quot; Xinhua also asserted that &quot;the so-called &#x27;truth, kindness and forbearance&#x27; principle preached by [Falun Gong] has nothing in common with the socialist ethical and cultural progress we are striving to achieve&quot;, and it also argued that it was necessary to crush Falun Gong in order to preserve the &quot;vanguard role and purity&quot; of the Chinese Communist Party. Other articles which appeared in the state-run media in the first days and weeks after the ban was imposed posited that Falun Gong must be defeated because its &quot;theistic&quot; philosophy was at odds with the Marxism–Leninism paradigm and the secular values of materialism.

Willy Wo-Lap Lam writes that Jiang Zemin&#x27;s campaign against Falun Gong may have been used to promote allegiance to himself; Lam quotes one party veteran as saying &quot;by unleashing a Mao-style movement [against Falun Gong], Jiang is forcing senior cadres to pledge allegiance to his line.&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that sources indicated not all of the Politburo Standing Committee shared Jiang&#x27;s view that Falun Gong should be eradicated, and Jiang alone made the decision of crackdown.

Human Rights Watch commented that the crackdown on Falun Gong reflects historical efforts by the CCP to eradicate religion, which the government believes is inherently subversive. The Chinese government protects five &quot;patriotic&quot;, state-sanctioned religious groups. Unregistered religions that fall outside the state-sanctioned organizations are thus vulnerable to suppression. &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; wrote: &quot;any group that does not come under the control of the Party is a threat&quot;. Craig S. Smith of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the party feels increasingly threatened by any belief system that challenges its ideology and has an ability to organize itself. That Falun Gong, whose belief system represented a revival of traditional Chinese religion, was being practiced by a large number of Communist Party members and members of the military was seen as particularly disturbing to Jiang Zemin; according to Julia Ching, &quot;Jiang accepts the threat of Falun Gong as an ideological one: spiritual beliefs against militant atheism and historical materialism. He [wished] to purge the government and the military of such beliefs.&quot;

Yuezhi Zhao points to several other factors that may have led to a deterioration of the relationship between Falun Gong and the Chinese state and media. These included infighting within China&#x27;s qigong establishment, the influence of qigong opponents among leaders of China, and the struggles from mid-1996 to mid-1999 between Falun Gong and the Chinese power elite over the status and treatment of the movement. According to Zhao, Falun Gong practitioners have established a &quot;resistance identity&quot;—one that stands against prevailing pursuits of wealth, power, scientific rationality, and &quot;the entire value system associated with China&#x27;s project of modernization.&quot; In China the practice represented an indigenous spiritual and moral tradition, a cultural revitalization movement, and it was a sharp contrast to &quot;Marxism with Chinese characteristics&quot;.

Vivienne Shue similarly writes that Falun Gong presented a comprehensive challenge to the CCP&#x27;s legitimacy. Shue argues that Chinese rulers have historically derived their legitimacy from their claim to possess an exclusive connection to the &quot;Truth&quot;. In imperial China, truth was based on a Confucian and Daoist cosmology, where in the case of the Communist Party, the truth is represented by Marxist–Leninism and historical materialism. Falun Gong challenged the Marxist–Leninism paradigm, reviving an understanding which is based on more traditionally Buddhist or Daoist conceptions. David Ownby contends that Falun Gong also challenged the Communist Party&#x27;s hegemony over the Chinese nationalist discourse: &quot;[Falun Gong&#x27;s] evocation of a different vision of Chinese tradition and its contemporary values are now so threatening to the state and the party because it denies them the sole right to define the meaning of Chinese nationalism, and it even denies them the sole right to define the meaning of Chineseness.&quot;

Maria Chang commented that since the overthrow of the Qin dynasty, &quot;Millenarian movements had exerted a profound impact on the course of Chinese history&quot;, culminating in the Chinese Revolutions of 1949, which brought the Chinese Communists to power. Patsy Rahn (2002) describes a paradigm of conflict between Chinese sectarian groups and the rulers who they often challenge. According to Rahn, the history of this paradigm goes back to the collapse of the Han dynasty: &quot;The pattern of a ruling power keeping a watchful eye on sectarian groups, at times threatened by them, at times raising campaigns against them, began as early as the second century and continued throughout the dynastic period, through the Mao era and into the present.&quot;

===Conversion program===
According to James Tong, the regime aimed at both coercive dissolution of the Falun Gong denomination and &quot;transformation&quot; of the practitioners. By 2000, the Party escalated its campaign by sentencing &quot;recidivist&quot; practitioners to &quot;re-education through labor&quot; in an effort to have them renounce their beliefs and &quot;transform&quot; their thoughts. Terms were also arbitrarily extended by police, while some practitioners had ambiguous charges levied against them, such as &quot;disrupting social order&quot;, &quot;endangering national security&quot;, or &quot;subverting the socialist system&quot;. According to Bejesky, the majority of long-term Falun Gong detainees are processed administratively through this system instead of the criminal justice system. Upon completion of their re-education sentences, those practitioners who refused to recant were then incarcerated in &quot;legal education centers&quot; set up by provincial authorities to &quot;transform minds&quot;.

Much of the conversion program relied on Mao-style techniques of indoctrination and thought reform, where Falun Gong practitioners were organized to view anti-Falun Gong television programs and enroll in Marxism and materialism study sessions. Traditional Marxism and materialism were the core content of the sessions.

The government-sponsored image of the conversion process emphasizes psychological persuasion and a variety of &quot;soft-sell&quot; techniques; this is the &quot;ideal norm&quot; in regime reports, according to Tong. Falun Gong reports, on the other hand, depict &quot;disturbing and sinister&quot; forms of coercion against practitioners who fail to renounce their beliefs. Among them are cases of severe beatings; psychological torment, corporal punishment and forced intense, heavy-burden hard labor and stress positions; solitary confinement in squalid conditions; &quot;heat treatment&quot; including burning and freezing; electric shocks delivered to sensitive parts of the body that may result in nausea, convulsions, or fainting; &quot;devastative&quot; forced feeding; sticking bamboo strips into fingernails; deprivation of food, sleep, and use of toilet; rape and gang rape; asphyxiation; and threat, extortion, and termination of employment and student status.

The cases appear verifiable, and the great majority identify (1) the individual practitioner, often with age, occupation, and residence; (2) the time and location that the alleged abuse took place, down to the level of the district, township, village, and often the specific jail institution; and (3) the names and ranks of the alleged perpetrators. Many such reports include lists of the names of witnesses and descriptions of injuries, Tong says. The publication of &quot;persistent abusive, often brutal behavior by named individuals with their official title, place, and time of torture&quot; suggests that there is no official will to cease and desist such activities.

===Deaths===
Due to the difficulty in corroborating reports of torture deaths in China, estimates of the number of Falun Gong practitioners who have been killed as a result of the persecution vary widely. In 2009, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that, according to human rights groups, the repressions had claimed &quot;at least 2,000&quot; lives. Amnesty International said at least 100 Falun Gong practitioners had reportedly died in the 2008 calendar year, either in custody or shortly after their release. Investigative journalist Ethan Gutmann estimated 65,000 Falun Gong were killed for their organs from 2000 to 2008 based on extensive interviews, while researchers David Kilgour and David Matas reported, &quot;the source of 41,500 transplants for the six-year period 2000 to 2005 is unexplained&quot;.

Chinese authorities do not publish statistics on Falun Gong practitioners killed amidst the crackdown. In individual cases, however, authorities have denied that deaths in custody were due to torture.

===Organ harvesting allegations===

In 2006, allegations emerged that a large number of Falun Gong practitioners had been killed to supply China&#x27;s organ transplant industry. These allegations prompted an investigation by former Canadian Secretary of State David Kilgour and human rights lawyer David Matas.

The Kilgour-Matas report was published in July 2006, and concluded that &quot;the government of China and its agencies in numerous parts of the country, in particular hospitals but also detention centers and &#x27;people&#x27;s courts&#x27;, since 1999 have put to death a large but unknown number of Falun Gong prisoners of conscience.&quot; The report, which was based mainly on circumstantial evidence, called attention to the extremely short wait times for organs in China—one to two weeks for a liver compared with 32.5 months in Canada—implying it was indicative of organs being procured on demand. It also tracked a significant increase in the number of annual organ transplants in China beginning in 1999, corresponding with the onset of the persecution of Falun Gong. Despite very low levels of voluntary organ donation, China performs the second-highest number of transplants per year. Kilgour and Matas also presented self-accusatory material from Chinese transplant center web sites advertising the immediate availability of organs from living donors, and transcripts of interviews in which hospitals told prospective transplant recipients that they could obtain Falun Gong organs.
In May 2008 two United Nations Special Rapporteurs reiterated requests for the Chinese authorities to respond to the allegations, and to explain a source for the organs that would account for the sudden increase in organ transplants in China since 2000. Chinese officials have responded by denying the organ harvesting allegations, and insisting that China abides by World Health Organization principles that prohibit the sale of human organs without written consent from donors. Responding to a U.S. House of Representatives Resolution calling for an end to abusing transplant practices against religious and ethnic minorities, a Chinese embassy spokesperson said &quot;the so-called organ harvesting from death-row prisoners is totally a lie fabricated by Falun Gong.&quot; In August 2009, Manfred Nowak, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture, said, &quot;The Chinese government has yet to come clean and be transparent... It remains to be seen how it could be possible that organ transplant surgeries in Chinese hospitals have risen massively since 1999, while there are never that many voluntary donors available.&quot;

In 2014, investigative journalist Ethan Gutmann published the result of his own investigation. Gutmann conducted extensive interviews with former detainees in Chinese labor camps and prisons, as well as former security officers and medical professionals with knowledge of China&#x27;s transplant practices. He reported that organ harvesting from political prisoners likely began in Xinjiang province in the 1990s, and then spread nationwide. Gutmann estimates that some 64,000 Falun Gong prisoners may have been killed for their organs between the years 2000 and 2008.

In a 2016 report, David Kilgour found that he had underestimated. In the new report he found that the government&#x27;s official estimates for the volume of organs harvested since the persecution of Falun Gong began to be 150,000 to 200,000. Media outlets have extrapolated from this study a death toll of 1.5 million. Ethan Gutmann estimated from this update that 60,000 to 110,000 organs are harvested in China annually observing that it is (paraphrasing): &quot;difficult but plausible to harvest 3 organs from a single body&quot; and also calls the harvest &quot;a new form of genocide using the most respected members of society.&quot;

In June 2019, the China Tribunal—an independent tribunal set up by the International Coalition to End Transplant Abuse in China—concluded that detainees including imprisoned followers of the Falun Gong movement are still being killed for organ harvesting. The Tribunal, chaired by Sir Geoffrey Nice QC, said it was &quot;certain that Falun Gong as a source—probably the principal source—of organs for forced organ harvesting&quot;.

In June 2021, the Special Procedures of the United Nations Human Rights Council voiced concerns over having &quot;received credible information that detainees from ethnic, linguistic or religious minorities may be forcibly subjected to blood tests and organ examinations such as ultrasound and x-rays, without their informed consent; while other prisoners are not required to undergo such examinations.&quot; The press release stated that UN&#x27;s human rights experts &quot;were extremely alarmed by reports of alleged &#x27;organ harvesting&#x27; targeting minorities, including Falun Gong practitioners, Uyghurs, Tibetans, Muslims and Christians, in detention in China.&quot;

===Media campaign===
The Chinese government&#x27;s campaign against Falun Gong was driven by large-scale propaganda through television, newspapers, radio and internet. The propaganda campaign focused on allegations that Falun Gong jeopardized social stability, was deceiving and dangerous, was anti-science and threatened progress, and argued that Falun Gong&#x27;s moral philosophy was incompatible with a Marxist social ethic.

China scholars Daniel Wright and Joseph Fewsmith stated that for several months after Falun Gong was outlawed, China Central Television&#x27;s evening news contained little but anti-Falun Gong rhetoric; the government operation was &quot;a study in all-out demonization&quot;, they wrote. Falun Gong was compared to &quot;a rat crossing the street that everyone shouts out to squash&quot; by &quot;Beijing Daily&quot;; other officials said it would be a &quot;long-term, complex and serious&quot; struggle to &quot;eradicate&quot; Falun Gong.

State propaganda initially used the appeal of scientific rationalism to argue that Falun Gong&#x27;s worldview was in &quot;complete opposition to science&quot; and communism. For example, the &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; asserted on 27 July 1999, that the fight against Falun Gong &quot;was a struggle between theism and atheism, superstition and science, idealism and materialism.&quot; Other editorials declared that Falun Gong&#x27;s &quot;idealism and theism&quot; are &quot;absolutely contradictory to the fundamental theories and principles of Marxism&quot;, and that the truth, kindness and forbearance&#x27; principle preached by [Falun Gong] has nothing in common with the socialist ethical and cultural progress we are striving to achieve.&quot; Suppressing Falun Gong was presented as a necessary step to maintaining the &quot;vanguard role&quot; of the CCP in Chinese society.

Despite Party efforts, initial charges leveled against Falun Gong failed to elicit widespread popular support for the persecution of the group. In the months following July 1999, the rhetoric in the state-run press escalated to include charges that Falun Gong was colluding with foreign, &quot;anti-China&quot; forces. In October 1999, three months after the persecution began, the &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; newspaper claimed Falun Gong as a &quot;xiejiao&quot; (). A direct translation of that term is &quot;heretical teaching&quot;, but during the anti-Falun Gong propaganda campaign was rendered as &quot;evil cult&quot; in English. According to a &quot;Washington Post&quot; report, it was Jiang Zemin who issued the order to label Falun Gong a &quot;cult&quot;. In Mainland China, the term &quot;xiejiao&quot; has been used to target religious organizations that do not submit to Communist Party authority.

Ian Johnson argued that applying the &#x27;cult&#x27; label to Falun Gong effectively &quot;cloaked the government&#x27;s crackdown with the legitimacy of the West&#x27;s anticult movement.&quot; He wrote that Falun Gong does not satisfy common definitions of a cult: &quot;its members marry outside the group, have outside friends, hold normal jobs, do not live isolated from society, do not believe that the world&#x27;s end is imminent and do not give significant amounts of money to the organisation... it does not advocate violence and is at heart an apolitical, inward-oriented discipline, one aimed at cleansing oneself spiritually and improving one&#x27;s health.&quot; David Ownby similarly wrote that &quot;the entire issue of the supposed cultic nature of Falun Gong was a red herring from the beginning, cleverly exploited by the Chinese state to blunt the appeal of Falun Gong&quot;. According to John Powers and Meg Y. M. Lee, because the Falun Gong was categorized in the popular perception as an &quot;apolitical, qigong exercise club&quot;, it was not seen as a threat to the government. The most critical strategy in the Falun Gong suppression campaign, therefore, was to convince people to reclassify the Falun Gong into a number of &quot;negatively charged religious labels&quot;, like &quot;evil cult&quot;, &quot;sect&quot;, or &quot;superstition&quot;. The group&#x27;s silent protests were reclassified as creating &quot;social disturbances&quot;. In this process of relabelling, the government was attempting to tap into a &quot;deep reservoir of negative feelings related to the historical role of quasi-religious cults as a destabilising force in Chinese political history.&quot;

A turning point in the propaganda campaign came on the eve of Chinese New Year on 23 January 2001, when five people attempted to set themselves ablaze on Tiananmen Square. The official Chinese press agency, Xinhua News Agency, and other state media asserted that the self-immolators were practitioners, though the Falun Dafa Information Center disputed this, on the grounds that the movement&#x27;s teachings explicitly forbid suicide and killing, further alleging that the event was &quot;a cruel (but clever) piece of stunt-work.&quot; The incident received international news coverage, and video footage of the burnings were broadcast later inside China by China Central Television (CCTV). The broadcasts showed images of a 12-year-old girl, Liu Siying, burning, and interviews with the other participants in which they stated a belief that self-immolation would lead them to paradise. But one of the CNN producers on the scene did not even see a child there. Falun Gong sources and other commentators pointed out that the main participants&#x27; account of the incident and other aspects of the participants&#x27; behavior were inconsistent with Falun Gong&#x27;s teachings. Media Channel and the International Education Development (IED) agree that the supposed self-immolation incident was staged by CCP to &quot;prove&quot; that Falun Gong brainwashes its followers to commit suicide and has therefore to be banned as a threat to the nation. IED&#x27;s statement at the 53rd UN session describes China&#x27;s violent assault on Falun Gong practitioners as state terrorism and that the self-immolation &quot;was staged by the government.&quot; &quot;Washington Post&quot; journalist Phillip Pan wrote that the two self-immolators who died were not actually Falun Gong practitioners. On 21 March 2001, Liu Siying suddenly died after appearing very lively and being deemed ready to leave the hospital to go home. &quot;Time&quot; reported that prior to the self-immolation incident, many Chinese had felt that Falun Gong posed no real threat, and that the state&#x27;s crackdown had gone too far. After the event, however, the mainland Chinese media campaign against Falun Gong gained significant traction. As public sympathy for Falun Gong declined, the government began sanctioning &quot;systematic use of violence&quot; against the group.

In February, 2001, the month following the Tiananmen Square self-immolation incident, Jiang Zemin convened a rare Central Work Conference to stress the importance of continuity in the anti-Falun Gong campaign and unite senior party officials behind the effort. Under Jiang&#x27;s leadership, the crackdown on Falun Gong became part of the Chinese political ethos of &quot;upholding stability&quot;—much the same rhetoric employed by the party during 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre. Jiang&#x27;s message was echoed at the 2001 National People&#x27;s Congress, where the Falun Gong&#x27;s eradication was tied to China&#x27;s economic progress. Though less prominent on the national agenda, the persecution of Falun Gong has carried on after Jiang was retired; successive, high-level &quot;strike hard&quot; campaigns against Falun Gong were initiated in both 2008 and 2009. In 2010, a three-year campaign was launched to renew attempts at the coercive &quot;transformation&quot; of Falun Gong practitioners.

====In the education system====
Anti-Falun Gong propaganda efforts have also permeated the Chinese education system. Following Jiang Zemin&#x27;s 1999 ban of Falun Gong, then-Minister of Education Chen Zhili launched an active campaign to promote the Party&#x27;s line on Falun Gong within all levels of academic institutions, including graduate schools, universities and colleges, middle schools, primary schools, and kindergartens. Her efforts included a &quot;Cultural Revolution-like pledge&quot; in Chinese schools that required faculty members, staff, and students to publicly denounce Falun Gong. Teachers who did not comply with Chen&#x27;s program were dismissed or detained; uncooperative students were refused academic advancement, expelled from school, or sent to &quot;transformation&quot; camps to alter their thinking. Chen also worked to spread the anti-Falun Gong academic propaganda movement overseas, using domestic educational funding to donate aid to foreign institutions, encouraging them to oppose Falun Gong.

===Falun Gong&#x27;s response to the persecution===

Falun Gong&#x27;s response to the persecution in China began in July 1999 with appeals to local, provincial, and central petitioning offices in Beijing. It soon progressed to larger demonstrations, with hundreds of Falun Gong practitioners traveling daily to Tiananmen Square to perform Falun Gong exercises or raise banners in defense of the practice. These demonstrations were invariably broken up by security forces, and the practitioners involved were arrested—sometimes violently—and detained. By 25 April 2000, a total of more than 30,000 practitioners had been arrested on the square; seven hundred Falun Gong followers were arrested during a demonstration in the square on 1 January 2001. Public protests continued well into 2001. Writing for the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;, Ian Johnson wrote that &quot;Falun Gong faithful have mustered what is arguably the most sustained challenge to authority in 50 years of Communist rule.&quot;

By late 2001, demonstrations in Tiananmen Square had become less frequent, and the practice was driven deeper underground. As public protest fell out of favor, practitioners established underground &quot;material sites&quot;, which would produce literature and DVDs to counter the portrayal of Falun Gong in the official media. Practitioners then distribute these materials, often door-to-door. Falun Gong sources estimated in 2009 that over 200,000 such sites exist across China today. The production, possession, or distribution of these materials is frequently grounds for security agents to incarcerate or sentence Falun Gong practitioners.

In 2002, Falun Gong activists in China tapped into television broadcasts, replacing regular state-run programming with their own content. One of the more notable instances occurred in March 2002, when Falun Gong practitioners in Changchun intercepted eight cable television networks in Jilin Province, and for nearly an hour, televised a program titled &quot;Self-Immolation or a Staged Act?&quot;. All six of the Falun Gong practitioners involved were captured over the next few months. Two were killed immediately, while the other four were all dead by 2010 as a result of injuries sustained while imprisoned.

Outside China, Falun Gong practitioners established international media organizations to gain wider exposure for their cause and challenge narratives of the Chinese state-run media. These include &quot;The Epoch Times&quot; newspaper, New Tang Dynasty Television, and Sound of Hope radio station. According to Zhao, through &quot;The Epoch Times&quot; it can be discerned how Falun Gong is building a &quot;de facto media alliance&quot; with China&#x27;s democracy movements in exile, as demonstrated by its frequent printing of articles by prominent overseas Chinese critics of the PRC government. In 2004, &quot;The Epoch Times&quot; published a collection of nine editorials that presented a critical history of the Chinese Communist Party. This catalyzed the Tuidang movement, which encourages Chinese citizens to renounce their affiliations to the Chinese Communist Party, including ex post facto renunciations of the Communist Youth League and Young Pioneers. &quot;The Epoch Times&quot; claims that tens of millions have renounced the Chinese Communist Party as part of the movement, though these numbers have not been independently verified.
In 2006, Falun Gong practitioners in the United States formed Shen Yun Performing Arts, a dance and music company that tours internationally. During Shen Yun&#x27;s 2024 season, the company&#x27;s eight touring troupes performed over 800 shows on five continents. By 2024, Shen Yun accumulated $266 million in assets mainly through ticket sales and by keeping its costs down through numerous volunteer hours and sometimes personal savings of Falun Gong adherents.

Falun Gong software developers in the United States are also responsible for the creation of several popular censorship-circumvention tools employed by internet users in China.

Falun Gong practitioners outside China have filed dozens of lawsuits against Jiang Zemin, Luo Gan, Bo Xilai, and other Chinese officials alleging genocide and crimes against humanity. According to &quot;International Advocates for Justice&quot;, Falun Gong has filed the largest number of human rights lawsuits in the 21st century and the charges are among the most severe international crimes defined by international criminal laws. As of 2006, 54 civil and criminal lawsuits were under way in 33 countries. In many instances, courts have refused to adjudicate the cases on the grounds of sovereign immunity. In late 2009, however, separate courts in Spain and Argentina indicted Jiang Zemin and Luo Gan on charges of &quot;crimes of humanity&quot; and genocide, and asked for their arrest—the ruling is acknowledged to be largely symbolic and unlikely to be carried out. The court in Spain also indicted Bo Xilai, Jia Qinglin and Wu Guanzheng.

Falun Gong practitioners and their supporters also filed a lawsuit in May 2011 against the technology company Cisco Systems, alleging that the company helped design and implement a surveillance system for the Chinese government to suppress Falun Gong. Cisco denied customizing their technology for this purpose.

==Falun Gong outside China==
Li Hongzhi began teaching Falun Gong internationally in March 1995. His first stop was in Paris where, at the invitation of the Chinese ambassador, he held a lecture seminar at the PRC embassy. This was followed by lectures in Sweden in May 1995. Between 1995 and 1999, Li gave lectures in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Germany, Switzerland, and Singapore.

Falun Gong&#x27;s growth outside China largely corresponded to the migration of students from mainland China to the West in the early-to-mid-1990s. Falun Gong associations and clubs began appearing in Europe, North America and Australia, with activities centered mainly on university campuses.

Translations of Falun Gong teachings began appearing in the late 1990s. As the practice began proliferating outside China, Li Hongzhi was beginning to receive recognition in the United States and elsewhere in the western world. In May 1999, Li was welcomed to Toronto with greetings from the city&#x27;s mayor and the provincial lieutenant governor, and in the two months that followed also received recognition from the cities of Chicago and San Jose.

Although the practice was beginning to attract an overseas constituency in the 1990s, it remained relatively unknown outside China until the Spring of 1999, when tensions between Falun Gong and the CCP became a subject of international media coverage. With the increased attention, the practice gained a greater following outside China. Following the launch of the CCP&#x27;s suppression campaign against Falun Gong, the overseas presence became vital to the practice&#x27;s resistance in China and its continued survival. Falun Gong practitioners overseas have responded to the persecution in China through regular demonstrations, parades, and through the creation of media outlets, performing arts companies, and censorship-circumvention software mainly intended to reach mainland Chinese audiences.

In its study of transnational repression committed by governments, Freedom House has reported that practitioners of Falun Gong have been targeted by the Chinese government&#x27;s transnational repression campaign.

==International reception==
Since 1999, numerous Western governments and human rights organizations have expressed condemnation of the Chinese government&#x27;s suppression of Falun Gong. Since 1999, members of the United States Congress have made public pronouncements and introduced several resolutions in support of Falun Gong. In 2010, U.S. House of Representatives Resolution 605 called for &quot;an immediate end to the campaign to persecute, intimidate, imprison, and torture Falun Gong practitioners&quot;, condemned the Chinese authorities&#x27; efforts to distribute &quot;false propaganda&quot; about the practice worldwide, and expressed sympathy to persecuted Falun Gong practitioners and their families.

Adam Frank writes that in reporting on the Falun Gong, the Western tradition of casting the Chinese as &quot;exotic&quot; took dominance, and that while the facts were generally correct in Western media coverage, &quot;the normalcy that millions of Chinese practitioners associated with the practice had all but disappeared.&quot; David Ownby wrote that alongside these tactics, the &quot;cult&quot; label applied to Falun Gong by the Chinese authorities never entirely went away in the minds of some Westerners, and the stigma still plays a role in wary public perceptions of Falun Gong.

To counter the support of Falun Gong in the West, the Chinese government expanded their efforts against the group internationally. This included visits to newspaper officers by diplomats to &quot;extol the virtues of Communist China and the evils of Falun Gong&quot;, linking support for Falun Gong with &quot;jeopardizing trade relations&quot;, and sending letters to local politicians telling them to withdraw support for the practice. According to Perry Link, pressure on Western institutions also takes more subtle forms, including academic self-censorship, whereby research on Falun Gong could result in a denial of visa for fieldwork in China; or exclusion and discrimination from business and community groups who have connections with China and fear angering Chinese government.

Although the persecution of Falun Gong has drawn considerable condemnation outside China, some observers assert that Falun Gong has failed to attract the level of sympathy and sustained attention afforded to other Chinese dissident groups.

Ethan Gutmann, a journalist reporting on China since the early 1990s, has attempted to explain this apparent dearth of public sympathy for Falun Gong as stemming, in part, from the group&#x27;s shortcomings in public relations. Unlike the democracy activists or Tibetans, who have found a comfortable place in Western perceptions, &quot;Falun Gong marched to a distinctly Chinese drum&quot;, Gutmann writes. Moreover, practitioners&#x27; attempts at getting their message across carried some of the uncouthness of Communist Party culture, including a perception that practitioners tended to exaggerate, create &quot;torture tableaux straight out of a Cultural Revolution opera&quot;, or &quot;spout slogans rather than facts&quot;. This is coupled with a general doubtfulness in the West of persecuted refugees. Gutmann also says that media organizations and human rights groups also self-censor on the topic, given the PRC governments vehement attitude toward the practice, and the potential repercussions that may follow for making overt representations on Falun Gong&#x27;s behalf.

Richard Madsen writes that Falun Gong lacks robust backing from the American constituencies that usually support religious freedom. For instance, Falun Gong&#x27;s conservative moral beliefs have alienated some liberal constituencies in the West (e.g. its teachings against promiscuity and homosexual behavior). He also states that Christian conservatives do not support Falun Gong while they do Chinese Christians. Madsen charges that the American political center does not want to push the human rights issue so hard that it would disrupt commercial and political relations with China. Thus, Falun Gong practitioners have largely had to rely on their own resources in responding to suppression.

In August 2007, the newly reestablished Rabbinic Sanhedrin deliberated persecution of the movement by the Chinese government at the request of Falun Gong.

<text>A biotope is an area of uniform environmental conditions providing a living place for a specific assemblage of plants and animals. &quot;Biotope&quot; is almost synonymous with the term &quot;habitat&quot;, which is more commonly used in English-speaking countries. However, in some countries these two terms are distinguished: the subject of a habitat is a population, the subject of a biotope is a &quot;biocoenosis&quot; or &quot;biological community&quot;. 

It is an English loanword derived from the German &quot;Biotop&quot;, which in turn came from the Greek &quot;bios&quot; (meaning &#x27;life&#x27;) and &quot;topos&quot; (&#x27;place&#x27;). (The related word &quot;geotope&quot; has made its way into the English language by the same route, from the German &quot;Geotop&quot;.)

==Ecology==
The concept of a biotope was first advocated by Ernst Haeckel (1834–1919), a German zoologist famous for the recapitulation theory. In his book &quot;General Morphology&quot; (1866), which defines the term &quot;ecology&quot;, he stresses the importance of the concept of habitat as a prerequisite for an organism&#x27;s existence. Haeckel also explains that with one ecosystem, its biota is shaped by environmental factors (such as water, soil, and geographical features) and interaction among living things; the original idea of a biotope was closely related to evolutional theory. Following this, F. Dahl, a professor at the Berlin Zoological Museum, referred to this ecological system as a &quot;biotope&quot; (biotop) (1908).

==Biotope restoration==
Although the term &quot;biotope&quot; is considered to be a technical word with respect to ecology, in recent years the term is more generally used in administrative and civic activities. Since the 1970s the term &quot;biotope&quot; has received great attention as a keyword throughout Europe (mainly Germany) for the preservation, regeneration, and creation of natural environmental settings. Used in this context, the term &quot;biotope&quot; often refers to a smaller and more specific ecology and is very familiar to human life. In Germany especially, activities related to regenerating biotopes are enthusiastically received. These activities include:
* making roof gardens
* reconstructing rivers to restore their natural qualities
* leaving bushes or trees on farms
* building nature parks along motorways
* making school gardens or ponds by considering the ecosystem
* bearing in mind ecological considerations in private gardens

Various sectors play a part in these activities, including architecture, civil engineering, urban planning, traffic, agriculture, river engineering, limnology, biology, education, landscape gardening, and domestic gardening. In all fields, all sorts of people are seeking a viable way for humans to respect other living things. The term &quot;biotope&quot; would include a complete environmental approach.

==Characteristics==
The following four points are the chief characteristics of biotopes.

===Microscale===
A biotope is generally not considered to be a large-scale phenomenon. For example, a biotope might be a neighbouring park, a back garden, potted plant, a terrarium or a fish tank on a porch. In other words, the biotope is not a macroscopic but a microscopic approach to preserving the ecosystem and biological diversity. So biotopes fit into ordinary people&#x27;s daily activities and lives, with more people being able to take part in biotope creation and continuing management.

===Biotope networks===
It is commonly emphasised that biotopes should not be isolated (although there are exceptions, such as manmade closed ecological systems which are specifically designed for no exchange of materials with the outside world). Instead biotopes need to be connected to each other and other surrounding life for without these connections to life-forms such as animals and plants, biotopes would not effectively work as a place in which diverse organisms live. So one of the most effective strategies for regenerating biotopes is to plan a &quot;stretch&quot; of biotopes, not just a &quot;point&quot; where animals and plants come and go. (Such an organic traffic course is called a corridor.) In the stretch method, the centre of the network would be large green tracts of land: a forest, natural park, or cemetery. By connecting parcels of land with smaller biotope areas such as a green belt along the river, small town parks, gardens, or even roadside trees, biotopes can exist in a network. In other words, a biotope is an open, not a closed, system and is a practicable strategy.

===Human daily life===
The term &quot;biotope&quot; does not apply to biosphere reserves, which are completely separate from humans and become the object of human admiration. Instead, it is an active part of human daily life. For example, an ornamental flower bed may be considered a biotope (though a rather small one) since it enhances the experience of daily life. An area that has many functions, such as human living space, and is home to other living things, whether plant or animal, can be considered a biosphere reserve.

===Artificial===
When artificial items are introduced to a biotope setting, their design and arrangement is of great importance for biotope regeneration. Tree-planting areas where the surface is uneven results in plants that sprout and the nesting of small insects. A mat or net made from natural fibres will gradually biodegrade as it is exposed to the weather. So there is no binomial opposition between the natural and the artificial in a biotope. Rather, such artificial materials are widely used.

==Germany==
It is especially characteristic in Germany, which is the birthplace of the term biotope, that the authorities take the initiative in conserving biotopes, maintaining consistency with urban or rural planning and considering the regions&#x27; history and landscape.

===Legal basis===
Since 1976, the federal nature protection law, &quot;Bundesnaturschutzgesetz&quot; (BNUM), requires that wild animals and plants and their community should be protected as part of the ecosystem in the specific diversity that has grown naturally and historically, and their biotope and other living conditions should be protected, preserved, developed, and restored. (Number 9, Clause 1, Article 2). The law also requires that some kinds of biotope that are full of a specific variety should not be harmed by development. So there is a law that mandates the protection of biotopes. There is also a provincial law corresponding to the federal one. Such developments were uncommon in those times.

===Landscape plan===
Many German states are obliged by law to produce a landscape plan (&quot;Landschaftsplan&quot;) as part of their urban planning, though these plans vary somewhat from place to place. The purpose of the &quot;Landschaftsplan&quot; is to protect the region&#x27;s environment and landscape. These plans use text and figures to describe the present environmental state and proposed remedies. They consider, for example, the regional lie of the land, climate, wind direction, soil, ground water, type of biotope, distribution of animals and plants, inhabitants&#x27; welfare and competition with development projects.

===Citizen welfare===
Biotope preservation in cities also emphasises recreation and relaxation for citizens and improving the urban environment. For example, in the reserve of Karlsruhe in Baden-Württemberg people can cycle on the bike path or walk the dog, although it is forbidden to gather plants and animals there or walk in the exclusion zone. At the core of biotope preservation is the idea that if civic life is surrounded by a rich profusion of nature whose background is in local history and culture, it is improved by protecting nature and preserving the landscape.

==Aquaria==

The term &quot;biotope&quot; is also often used by aquarium hobbyists to describe an aquarium setup that tries to simulate the natural habitat of a specific assemblage of fish. The idea is to replicate conditions such as water parameters, natural plants, substrate, water type (fresh, saline or brackish), lighting, and to include other native fish which usually live together in nature and as such, represent a particular real-world biotope. An example of one South American biotope type might be &quot;Forest creek tributary of Rio Negro near Barcelos, Brazil&quot; with many branches, twigs, roots, dead leaves, light sandy substrate, tannin-stained water and subdued lighting with floating plants, along with &quot;Nannostomus eques&quot;, &quot;Paracheirodon axelrodi&quot;, &quot;Hemigrammus bleheri&quot;, and &quot;Dicrossus filamentosus&quot;. &quot;South American&quot; is not itself a biotope, as South America contains thousands of distinct biotopes in different regions.
== Artificial closed ecological systems ==
The term &quot;biotope&quot; can be also used to describe manmade closed ecological systems, occasionally also referred to as CES systems. Examples of these include the Biosphere 2 project and to a lesser degree the Eden Project, which contain areas of uniform environmental conditions and house numerous species of plants, animals and fungi. Therefore these can be considered biotopes. Homemade ecological systems, often incorrectly referred to as ecospheres (due to the product, known as the EcoSphere) or jarrariums also fall under the definition of biotope. These homemade ecosystems (which also include closed terrariums) are often made by hobbyists in what are often jars (hence the name jarrarium) or sealed glass tanks with the intention of mimicking a larger ecosystem. They are often made by going out and collecting material (including soil, plants, small insects and water if an aquatic ecosystem) from said ecosystem and sealing it in an airtight container. These closed ecosystems are often made by hobbyists who enjoy the idea of having an entire ecosystem on their windowsill, or by those interested in studying the viability of small scale, closed loop ecological systems for the purpose potentially creating life support systems.

<text>The 88000 (m88k for short) is a RISC instruction set architecture developed by Motorola during the 1980s. The MC88100 arrived on the market in 1988, some two years after the competing SPARC and MIPS. Due to the late start and extensive delays releasing the second-generation MC88110, the m88k achieved very limited success outside of the MVME platform and embedded controller environments. When Motorola joined the AIM alliance in 1991 to develop the PowerPC, further development of the 88000 ended.

== History ==
===Background===
Motorola entered the 1980s in a position of strength; the company&#x27;s recently-introduced Motorola 68000 easily outperformed any other microprocessor on the market, and its 32-bit architecture was naturally suited to the emerging workstation market. Intel was not moving aggressively into the 32-bit space, and the companies that did, notably National Semiconductor, botched their releases and left Motorola in control of everything that was not Intel. At the time, Intel held about 80% of the overall computer market, while Motorola controlled 90% of the rest.

Into this came the early 1980&#x27;s introduction of the RISC concept. At first, there was an intense debate within the industry whether the concept would actually improve performance, or if its longer machine language programs would actually slow the execution through additional memory accesses. All such debate was ended by the mid-1980s when the first RISC-based workstations emerged; the latest Sun-3/80 running on a 20 MHz Motorola 68030 delivered about 3 MIPS, whereas the first SPARC-based Sun-4/260 with a 16 MHz SPARC delivered 10 MIPS. Hewlett-Packard, DEC and other large vendors all began moving to RISC platforms.

This shift in the market had the potential to lock Motorola out of the workstation market, one of its only strongholds and among its most lucrative. Apple remained the company&#x27;s only large vendor outside the workstation space; other users of the 68000, notably Atari Corporation and Commodore International, were floundering in a market that was rapidly standardizing on IBM PC compatibles.

===Motorola&#x27;s approach===
RISC designs were a conscious effort to tailor the processor to the types of operations being called by the compilers on that platform, in the case of Unix workstations, the C programming language. The seminal IBM 801 project had noted that compilers generally did not use the vast majority of the instructions available to them, and instead used the simplest version of the instructions, often because these performed the fastest. Yet the circuitry providing the other versions of these instructions added overhead even to the simplest version. Removing these unused instructions from the CPU eliminated this overhead and freed up significant room on the chip. This gave room to increase the number of processor registers, which had a far greater impact on performance than the removed special-case instructions. For this reason, the RISC concept can be said to be driven by the real-world design of compilers.

Motorola&#x27;s articles on the 88000 design speak of single-cycle instructions, large processor register files and other hallmarks of the RISC concept, but don&#x27;t mention the word &quot;RISC&quot; even once. As existing RISC designs had entered the market already, the company decided that it would not attempt to compete with these and would instead produce the world&#x27;s most powerful processor. To do this, it took design notes from one of the fastest computers of a previous era, the CDC 6600 supercomputer. In particular, it adopted the 6600&#x27;s concept of a scoreboard. Scoreboarding allowed the CPU to examine the instruction&#x27;s use of registers and immediately dispatch those that did not rely on previous calculations that were not yet complete; this allowed the instructions to be re-ordered to allow ones that had their required data to run while others had their data loaded from the cache or memory. This instruction reordering could improve usage by as much as 35%.

The design also used separate data and instruction address busses. This was costly in terms of pin count; both the instruction and data caches had 32 pins for their address and 32 pins for the data, meaning the complete system used 128 pins on the &quot;P-bus&quot;. This design was based on the observation that only about one-third of operations were memory-related; the rest were operating on data already read. This strongly favored having a dedicated instruction pathway to an external instruction cache. The caches and associated memory management units (MMU) were initially external, a cache controller could be connected to either the data or instruction busses, and up to four controllers could be used on either bus. Internally there were three 32-bit busses, connected to the internal units in different ways as required for reading and writing data to the registers.

Another feature of the new design was its built-in support for specialized co-processors, or &quot;special function units&quot;, or SFUs. In addition to the internal commands supported out of the box, it set aside blocks of 256 instructions that could be used by co-processors. This was aimed at designers who wished to customize the system; new functional units could be added without affecting the existing instruction set architecture, ensuring software compatibility for the main functionality. Every 88000 came with SFU1 already installed, the floating point unit (FPU). The branch and jump instructions incorporate a delayed branch option (.n), which can be specified to ensure that the subsequent sequential instruction is executed before the branch target instruction, irrespective of the branch condition. Placing branch instruction or other instruction which may change the instruction pointer, in the branch delay slot is deprecated to maintain future compatibility.

===Release===
By 1987 it was widely known that Motorola was designing its own RISC processor. Referred to by the computer industry as the &quot;78000&quot;, an homage to the earlier 68000, it became the 88000 when it was released in April 1988.

As a side-effect of the complexity of the design, the CPU did not fit on a single chip. The 68030, released a year earlier, had 273,000 transistors, including the arithmetic logic unit (ALU) and memory management unit (MMU) on a single chip, with the optional floating point unit (FPU) as a separate chip. In contrast, the 88000 packaged the ALU and FPU together on the 750,000 transistor MC88100, and the memory management unit (MMU) and 16 KB static RAM cache in the 750,000 transistor MC88200. In contrast to the 68030 where the FPU was truly optional, a practical 88000 system could not be built without at least one MC88200. Systems could include more than one MC88200, producing larger caches and allowing multiple paths to main memory for improved performance.

Aimed at the high-end of the market, it was claimed to be the fastest 32-bit processor in the world when it was released. Running at 20 MHz, it reached 34,000 Dhrystones or 17 VUPS, compared to about 12 MIPS for a 12.5 MHz SPARC of the same vintage in the SPARCstation, or around 3.3 MIPS of the 20 MHz 68030. It was also available as a 25 MHz part at 21 MIPS, 48,387 Dhrystones.

At the time, Motorola marketed the 88000 strictly to the high-end of the market, including &quot;telecommunications, artificial intelligence, graphics, three-dimensional animation, simulation, parallel processing and supercomputers&quot;, while it suggested the existing 68k series would continue to be used in the workstation market. Instead, most potential customers ignored the 88000, and the system saw little use.

===Re-release===
As the original release saw next to no use outside Motorola&#x27;s own products, and those traditional customers were starting to move to other RISC designs, the company re-launched the design in a single-chip form, the MC88110. In the late 1980s, several companies were actively examining the 88000 series for future use, including NeXT, Apple Computer and Apollo Computer, but all had given up on the design by the time the 88110 was finally available in 1992.

There was an attempt to popularize the system with the 88open group, similar to what Sun Microsystems was attempting with its SPARC design. It appears to have failed in any practical sense.

===Abandonment===
In the early 1990s Motorola joined the AIM effort to create a new RISC architecture based on the IBM POWER architecture. It worked a few features of the 88000 (such as a compatible bus interface) into the new PowerPC architecture to offer its customer base some sort of upgrade path. At that point the 88000 was dumped as soon as possible.

==Architecture==
Like the 68000 before it, the 88000 was considered to be a &quot;clean&quot; design. It is a pure 32-bit load/store architecture with separate instruction and data caches (Harvard architecture), and separate data and address buses. It has a small, powerful command set and uses a flat address space.

An unusual architectural feature is that both integer instructions and floating-point instructions use the same register file.

== Implementations ==

The first implementation of the 88000 ISA was the MC88100 microprocessor, which included an integrated FPU. Mated to this was the MC88200 MMU and cache controller. The idea behind this splitting of duties was to allow multiprocessor systems to be built more easily; a single MC88200 could support up to four MC88100s. However, this also meant that building the most basic system, with a single processor, required both chips and considerable wiring between them, driving up costs. This was likely to be another major reason for the 88000&#x27;s limited success.

The MC88100 implemented a &#x27;Master/Checker&#x27; capability for fault tolerance employing two or more redundant MC88100s:
In this application, two processors are wired together. The master processor (PCE negated) operates normally. The checker processor (PCE asserted) places all of its outputs in the high impedance state except ERR; all outputs are monitored as inputs. The checker processor performs the same operations as the master processor and compares its internal results with the results read from the high-impedance pins. If a mismatch occurs between the master and checker, the checker asserts ERR. External logic must then determine the appropriate action for the system.
The packaging &amp; cost issue was later addressed by the superscalar MC88110, which combined the CPU, FPU, MMU, and L1 cache into a single package. An additional modification, made at the behest of MIT&#x27;s *T project, resulted in the MC88110MP, including on-chip communications for use in multi-processor systems. A version capable of speeds up to 100 MHz was planned as the MC88120, but was never built.

An implementation for embedded applications, the MC88300, was under development during the early 1990s, but was eventually canceled. Ford Motor Company had planned to use the chips, which alongside adoption by telecommunications vendors had been viewed as guaranteeing the viability of the architecture indefinitely. Motorola offered a PowerPC design as a replacement, which Ford accepted.

== Products and applications ==

Motorola released a series of single-board computers, known as the MVME series, for building &quot;out of the box&quot; systems based on the 88000, as well as the Series 900 &quot;stackable&quot; computers employing these MVME boards. Unlike tower or rack mount systems, the Series 900 sat on top of each other and connected to one another with bus-like cabling. The concept never caught on.

Major 3rd party users were limited. The only widespread use would be in the Data General AViiON series. These were fairly popular, and remain in limited use today. For later models, DG moved to Intel. Encore Computer built its Encore-91 machine on the m88k, then introduced a completely ground-up redesign as the Infinity 90 series, but it is unclear how many of these machines were sold. Encore moved to the Alpha. Tektronix introduced its XD88 line of graphics workstations in April 1989.

GEC Computers used the MC88100 to build the GEC 4310, one of the GEC 4000 series computers, but issues with memory management meant it didn&#x27;t perform as well as the company&#x27;s earlier gate array based and Am2900 based GEC 4000 series computers. The BBN Butterfly model TC-2000 used the MC88100 processor, and scaled to 512 CPUs. Linotype-Hell used the 88110 in its &quot;Power&quot; workstations running the DaVinci raster graphics editor for image manipulation.

The MC88110 made it into some versions of a never released NeXT machine, the NeXT RISC Workstation, but the project was canceled along with all NeXT hardware projects in 1993. The 4-processor OMRON LUNA-88K machines from Japan used the m88k, and were used for a short time on the Mach kernel project at Carnegie Mellon University. In the early 1990s Northern Telecom used the MC88100 and MC88110 as the central processor in its DMS SuperNode family of telephone switches.

Most other users were much smaller. Alpha Microsystems originally planned to migrate to the 88K architecture from the Motorola 68000, and internally created a machine around it running UNIX System V, but it was later scrapped in favour of later 68K derivatives. NCD used the 88100 (without the 88200) in its 88K X-Terminals. Dolphin Server, a spin-off from the dying Norsk Data, built servers based on the 88k. Around 100 systems were shipped during 1988-1992.

Virtuality used the MC88110 in the SU2000 virtual reality arcade machine as a graphics processor, with one MC88110 per screen of each virtual reality headset.

In the embedded computer space, the &quot;Tri-channel VMS Computer&quot; in the F-15 S/MTD used three 88000s in a triply redundant computer.

== Operating system support ==
Motorola released its own UNIX System V derivative, System V/88, for its 88000-based systems. There were two major releases: Release 3.2 Version 3 and Release 4.0 Version 3.&lt;ref name=&quot;UNIX System V/88&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Data General AViiON systems ran DG/UX. OpenBSD ports exist for the MVME systems,&lt;ref name=&quot;OpenBSD/mvme88k&quot;&gt;OpenBSD/mvme88k&lt;/ref&gt; LUNA-88K workstations,&lt;ref name=&quot;OpenBSD/luna88k&quot;&gt;OpenBSD/luna88k&lt;/ref&gt; and Data General AViiON systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;OpenBSD/aviion&quot;&gt;OpenBSD/aviion&lt;/ref&gt; At least one unofficial experimental NetBSD port exists for the MVME systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;NetBSD/m88k&quot;&gt;NetBSD/m88k Unofficial port of NetBSD 3.x&lt;/ref&gt;

<text>The Jakarta Project created and maintained open source software for the Java platform. It operated as an umbrella project under the auspices of the Apache Software Foundation, and all Jakarta products are released under the Apache License. As of December 21, 2011 the Jakarta project was retired because no subprojects were remaining.

In 2018 Jakarta EE, a part of the Eclipse Enterprise for Java (EE4J) project, became the new name for the Java EE platform at the Eclipse Foundation.

==Subprojects==
Major contributions by the Jakarta Project include tools, libraries and frameworks such as:

*BCEL - a Java byte code manipulation library
*BSF - a scripting framework
*Cactus - a unit testing framework for server-side Java classes
*Apache JMeter - a load- and stress-testing tool.
* Slide - a content repository primarily using WebDAV

The following projects were formerly part of Jakarta, but now form independent projects within the Apache Software Foundation:

*Ant - a build tool
*Commons - a collection of useful classes intended to complement Java&#x27;s standard library.
*HiveMind - a services and configuration microkernel
*Maven - a project build and management tool 
*POI - a pure Java port of Microsoft&#x27;s popular file formats.
*Struts - a web application development framework
*Tapestry - A component object model based on JavaBeans properties and strong specifications
*Tomcat - a JSP/Servlet container
*Turbine - a rapid development web application framework
*Velocity - a template engine

==Project name==

Jakarta is named after the conference room at Sun Microsystems where the majority of discussions leading to the project&#x27;s creation took place. At the time, Sun&#x27;s Java software division was headquartered in a Cupertino building where the conference room names were all coffee references.

<text>Hydatellales is a botanical name for an order of flowering plants. In the Cronquist system, 1981, the name was used for an order placed in the subclass Commelinidae in class Liliopsida [=monocotyledons]. The order consisted of one family only:

* order Hydatellales
*: family Hydatellaceae

Similarly the Dahlgren system recognised this order (with the same circumscription and placed it in superorder Commelinanae in subclass Liliidae [=monocotyledons].

The APG II system assigns these plants to the order Poales, close to the grasses and sedges. Recent study by Saarela &quot;et al.&quot;, however, suggests a position out of the Poales; here, the Hydatellaceae link with the waterlilies, the first time a plant has been ejected from the monocots. The Angiosperm Phylogeny Website had since updated the Nymphaeales page to include the family.

<text>In telecommunications, a hop is a portion of a signal&#x27;s journey from source to receiver. Examples include:
#The excursion of a radio wave from the Earth to the ionosphere and back to the Earth. The number of hops indicates the number of reflections from the ionosphere.
#A similar excursion from an earth station to a communications satellite to another station, counted similarly except that if the return trip is not by satellite, then it is only a half hop.

In computer networks, a hop is the step from one network segment to the next.

<doc id="55188" wikidata="Q199654" url="?curid=55188" title="Barbara McClintock">
<text>Barbara McClintock (June 16, 1902 – September 2, 1992) was an American scientist and cytogeneticist who was awarded the 1983 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. McClintock received her PhD in botany from Cornell University in 1927. There she started her career as the leader of the development of maize cytogenetics, the focus of her research for the rest of her life. From the late 1920s, McClintock studied chromosomes and how they change during reproduction in maize. She developed the technique for visualizing maize chromosomes and used microscopic analysis to demonstrate many fundamental genetic ideas. One of those ideas was the notion of genetic recombination by crossing-over during meiosis—a mechanism by which chromosomes exchange information. She is often credited with producing the first genetic map for maize, linking regions of the chromosome to physical traits. However this legend has been corrected by Kass (2024). She demonstrated the role of the telomere and centromere, regions of the chromosome that are important in the conservation of genetic information. She was recognized as among the best in the field, awarded prestigious fellowships, and elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1944.

During the 1940s and 1950s, McClintock discovered transposons and used it to demonstrate that genes are responsible for turning physical characteristics on and off. She developed theories to explain the suppression and expression of genetic information from one generation of maize plants to the next. Due to skepticism of her research and its implications, she stopped publishing her data in 1953.

Later, she made an extensive study of the cytogenetics and ethnobotany of maize races from South America. McClintock&#x27;s research became well understood in the 1960s and 1970s, as other scientists confirmed the mechanisms of genetic change and protein expression that she had demonstrated in her maize research in the 1940s and 1950s. Awards and recognition for her contributions to the field followed, including the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, awarded to her in 1983 for the discovery of genetic transposition; as of 2023, she remains the only woman who has received an unshared Nobel Prize in that category.

==Early life==
Barbara McClintock was born Eleanor McClintock on June 16, 1902, in Hartford, Connecticut, the third of four children born to homeopathic physician Thomas Henry McClintock and Sara Handy McClintock. Thomas McClintock was the child of British immigrants. Marjorie, the oldest child, was born in October 1898; Mignon, the second daughter, was born in November 1900. The youngest, Malcolm Rider (called Tom), was born 18 months after Barbara. When she was a young girl, her parents determined that Eleanor, a &quot;feminine&quot; and &quot;delicate&quot; name, was not appropriate for her, and chose Barbara instead. McClintock was an independent child beginning at a very young age, a trait she later identified as her &quot;capacity to be alone&quot;. From the age of three until she began school, McClintock lived with an aunt and uncle in Brooklyn, New York, in order to reduce the financial burden on her parents while her father established his medical practice. She was described as a solitary and independent child. She was close to her father, but had a difficult relationship with her mother, tension that began when she was young.

The McClintock family moved to Brooklyn in 1908 and McClintock completed her secondary education there at Erasmus Hall High School; she graduated early in 1919. This legend was dispelled by Kass (2024, p. 11), she did not graduate early in 1919, she graduated with the class of &#x27;19 in June 1919. She discovered her love of science and reaffirmed her solitary personality during high school. She wanted to continue her studies at Cornell University&#x27;s College of Agriculture. Her mother resisted sending McClintock to college for fear that she would be unmarriageable, a common attitude at the time. McClintock was almost prevented from starting college, but her father allowed her to just before registration began, and she matriculated at Cornell in 1919.

==Education and research at Cornell==

McClintock began her studies at Cornell&#x27;s College of Agriculture in 1919. There, she participated in student government and was invited to join a sorority, though she soon realized that she preferred not to join formal organizations. McClintock broke her sorority pledge because of their antisemetic policy (Kass 2024, p. 18). Instead, McClintock took up music, specifically jazz. She studied botany, receiving a BSc in 1923. Her interest in genetics began when she took her first course in that field in 1921. The course was based on a similar one offered at Harvard University, and was taught by C. B. Hutchison, a plant breeder and geneticist. Hutchison was impressed by McClintock&#x27;s interest, and telephoned to invite her to participate in the graduate genetics course at Cornell in 1922. McClintock pointed to Hutchison&#x27;s invitation as a catalyst for her interest in genetics: &quot;Obviously, this telephone call cast the die for my future. I remained with genetics thereafter.&quot; Although it has been reported that women could not major in genetics at Cornell, and therefore her MS and PhD—earned in 1925 and 1927, respectively—were officially awarded in botany, recent research has revealed that women were permitted to earn graduate degrees in Cornell&#x27;s Plant Breeding Department during the time that McClintock was a student at Cornell.(see also Kass 2024, Chapter 2).

During her graduate studies and postgraduate appointment as a botany instructor, McClintock was instrumental in assembling a group that studied the new field of cytogenetics in maize. This group brought together plant breeders and cytologists, and included Marcus Rhoades, future Nobel laureate George Beadle, and Harriet Creighton. Rollins A. Emerson, head of the Plant Breeding Department, supported these efforts, although he was not a cytologist himself. (see also Kass 2024, chapter 4).

She also worked as a research assistant for Lowell Fitz Randolph and then for Lester W. Sharp, both Cornell botanists. (see also Kass 2024, chapter 3).

McClintock&#x27;s cytogenetic research focused on developing ways to visualize and characterize maize chromosomes. This particular part of her work influenced a generation of students, as it was included in most textbooks. She also developed a technique using carmine staining to visualize maize chromosomes, and showed for the first time the morphology of the 10 maize chromosomes. This discovery was made because she observed cells from the microspore as opposed to the root tip. (Kass 2024, Chapter 4) By studying the morphology of the chromosomes, McClintock was able to link specific chromosome groups of traits that were inherited together. Marcus Rhoades noted that McClintock&#x27;s 1929 &quot;Genetics&quot; paper on the characterization of triploid maize chromosomes triggered scientific interest in maize cytogenetics, and attributed to her 10 of the 17 significant advances in the field that were made by Cornell scientists between 1929 and 1935.

In 1930, McClintock was the first person to describe the cross-shaped interaction of homologous chromosomes during meiosis. The following year, McClintock and Creighton proved the link between chromosomal crossover during meiosis and the recombination of genetic traits. (Kass 2024,pp. 75–79). They observed how the recombination of chromosomes seen under a microscope correlated with new traits. Until this point, it had only been hypothesized that genetic recombination could occur during meiosis, although it had not been shown genetically. It is often reported that McClintock published the first genetic map for maize in 1931, showing the order of three genes on maize chromosome 9., however, it was her genetics professor C. B. Hutchison who has published the first genetic linkage maps for Chromosome 9 in 1921 and 1922 (See Kass 2024, p. 50). Her chromosome map showed that the arrangement of genes was consistent with the linkage map published by Hutchison in 1921 (see Kass 2024, p. 51). This information provided necessary data for the crossing-over study she published with Creighton; they also showed that crossing-over occurs in sister chromatids as well as homologous chromosomes. In 1938, she produced a cytogenetic analysis of the centromere, describing the organization and function of the centromere, as well as the fact that it can divide.

McClintock&#x27;s breakthrough publications, and support from her colleagues, led to her being awarded several postdoctoral fellowships from the National Research Council. This funding allowed her to continue to study genetics at Cornell, the University of Missouri, and the California Institute of Technology, where she worked with E. G. Anderson. During the summers of 1931 and 1932, she worked at the University of Missouri with geneticist Lewis Stadler, who introduced her to the use of X-rays as a mutagen. Exposure to X-rays can increase the rate of mutation above the natural background level, making it a powerful research tool for genetics. Through her work with X-ray-mutagenized maize, she identified ring chromosomes, which form when the ends of a single chromosome fuse together after radiation damage. McClintock found the first ring chromosome in maize in 1931, but the first ring chromosome was first reported by Michael Navashin, who she cited in her first study with Stadler (Kass 2024, p. 79). From this evidence, McClintock hypothesized that there must be a structure on the chromosome tip that would normally ensure stability. She showed that the loss of ring-chromosomes at meiosis caused variegation in maize foliage in generations subsequent to irradiation resulting from chromosomal deletion. During this period, she demonstrated the presence of the nucleolus organizer region on a region on maize chromosome 6, which is required for the assembly of the nucleolus. In 1933, she established that cells can be damaged when nonhomologous recombination occurs. During this same period, McClintock hypothesized that the tips of chromosomes are protected by telomeres.

McClintock received a fellowship from the Guggenheim Foundation that made possible six months of training in Germany during 1933 and 1934. She had planned to work with Curt Stern, who had demonstrated crossing-over in &quot;Drosophila&quot; just weeks after McClintock and Creighton had done so; however, Stern emigrated to the United States. Instead, she worked with geneticist Richard B. Goldschmidt, who was a director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biology in Berlin. She left Germany early amidst mounting political tension in Europe, returned to Cornell, but found that the university would not hire a woman professor. Legends such as the one cited here are based on undocumented evidence. Kass 2024 has evidence that McClintock worked at Cornell on her return to Cornell after spending only 5 months in Germany. Emerson hired her as his assistant in the Department of Plant Breeding where McClintock conducted independent research which led to a job offer as an Assistant Professor at the University of Missouri (Kass 2024, pp. pp. 92–95). In 1936, she accepted an Assistant Professorship offered to her by Lewis Stadler in the Department of Botany at the University of Missouri in Columbia. While still at Cornell, she was supported by a two-year Rockefeller Foundation grant obtained for her through Emerson&#x27;s efforts.

==University of Missouri==
During her time at Missouri, McClintock expanded her research on the effect of X-rays on maize cytogenetics. McClintock observed the breakage and fusion of chromosomes in irradiated maize cells. She was also able to show that, in some plants, spontaneous chromosome breakage occurred in the cells of the endosperm. Over the course of mitosis, she observed that the ends of broken chromatids were rejoined after the chromosome replication. In the anaphase of mitosis, the broken chromosomes formed a chromatid bridge, which was broken when the chromatids moved towards the cell poles. The broken ends were rejoined in the interphase of the next mitosis, and the cycle was repeated, causing massive mutation, which she could detect as variegation in the endosperm. This breakage–rejoining–bridge cycle was a key cytogenetic discovery for several reasons. First, it showed that the rejoining of chromosomes was not a random event, and second, it demonstrated a source of large-scale mutation. For this reason, it remains an area of interest in cancer research today.

Although her research was progressing at Missouri, McClintock was not satisfied with her position at the university. She recalled being excluded from faculty meetings, and was not made aware of positions available at other institutions. In 1940, she wrote to Charles Burnham, &quot;I have decided that I must look for another job. As far as I can make out, there is nothing more for me here. I am an assistant professor at $3,000 and I feel sure that that is the limit for me.&quot; Initially, McClintock&#x27;s position was created especially for her by Stadler, and might have depended on his presence at the university. McClintock believed she would not gain tenure at Missouri, even though according to some accounts, she knew she would be offered a promotion from Missouri in the spring of 1942. Recent evidence reveals that McClintock more likely decided to leave Missouri because she had lost trust in her employer and in the university administration, after discovering that her job would be in jeopardy if Stadler were to leave for Caltech, as he had considered doing. The university&#x27;s retaliation against Stadler amplified her sentiments. (Kass 2024, Chapter 6).

In early 1941, she took a leave of absence from Missouri in hopes of finding a position elsewhere. She accepted a visiting Professorship at Columbia University, where her former Cornell colleague Marcus Rhoades was a professor. Rhoades also offered to share his research field at Cold Spring Harbor on Long Island. In December 1941, she was offered a temporary research position by Milislav Demerec, the newly appointed acting director of the Carnegie Institution of Washington&#x27;s Department of Genetics Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory; McClintock accepted his invitation despite her qualms and became a permanent member of the staff in 1943 .(Kass 2024, p. 128).

==Cold Spring Harbor==
After her year-long temporary appointment, McClintock accepted a full-time research position at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. There, she was highly productive and continued her work with the breakage-fusion-bridge cycle, using it to substitute for X-rays as a tool for mapping new genes. In 1944, in recognition of her prominence in the field of genetics during this period, McClintock was elected to the National Academy of Sciences—only the third woman to be elected. The following year she became the first female president of the Genetics Society of America; she had been elected its vice-president in 1939. In 1944 she undertook a cytogenetic analysis of &quot;Neurospora crassa&quot; at the suggestion of George Beadle, who used the fungus to demonstrate the one gene–one enzyme relationship. He invited her to Stanford to undertake the study. She successfully described the number of chromosomes, or karyotype, of &quot;N. crassa&quot; and described the entire life cycle of the species. Beadle said, &quot;Barbara, in two months at Stanford, did more to clean up the cytology of &quot;Neurospora&quot; than all other cytological geneticists had done in all previous time on all forms of mold.&quot; &quot;N. crassa&quot; has since become a model species for classical genetic analysis.

===Discovery of controlling elements===
In the summer of 1944 at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, McClintock began systematic studies on the mechanisms of the mosaic color patterns of maize seed and the unstable inheritance of this mosaicism. She identified two new dominant and interacting genetic loci that she named &quot;Dissociation&quot; (&quot;Ds&quot;) and &quot;Activator&quot; (&quot;Ac&quot;). She found that the &quot;Dissociation&quot; did not just dissociate or cause the chromosome to break, it also had a variety of effects on neighboring genes when the &quot;Activator&quot; was also present, which included making certain stable mutations unstable. In early 1948, she made the surprising discovery that both &quot;Dissociation&quot; and &quot;Activator&quot; could transpose, or change position, on the chromosome.

She observed the effects of the transposition of &quot;Ac&quot; and &quot;Ds&quot; by the changing patterns of coloration in maize kernels over generations of controlled crosses, and described the relationship between the two loci through intricate microscopic analysis. She concluded that &quot;Ac&quot; controls the transposition of the &quot;Ds&quot; from chromosome 9, and that the movement of &quot;Ds&quot; is accompanied by the breakage of the chromosome. When &quot;Ds&quot; moves, the aleurone-color gene is released from the suppressing effect of the &quot;Ds&quot; and transformed into the active form, which initiates the pigment synthesis in cells. The transposition of &quot;Ds&quot; in different cells is random, it may move in some but not others, which causes color mosaicism. The size of the colored spot on the seed is determined by stage of the seed development during dissociation. McClintock also found that the transposition of &quot;Ds&quot; is determined by the number of &quot;Ac&quot; copies in the cell.

Between 1948 and 1950, she developed a theory by which these mobile elements regulated the genes by inhibiting or modulating their action. She referred to &quot;Dissociation&quot; and &quot;Activator&quot; as &quot;controlling units&quot;—later, as &quot;controlling elements&quot;—to distinguish them from genes. She hypothesized that gene regulation could explain how complex multicellular organisms made of cells with identical genomes have cells of different function. McClintock&#x27;s discovery challenged the concept of the genome as a static set of instructions passed between generations. In 1950, she reported her work on &quot;Ac/Ds&quot; and her ideas about gene regulation in a paper entitled &quot;The origin and behavior of mutable loci in maize&quot; published in the journal &quot;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&quot;. In summer 1951, she reported her work on the origin and behavior of mutable loci in maize at the annual symposium at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, presenting a paper of the same name. The paper delved into the instability caused by &quot;Ds&quot; and &quot;Ac&quot; or just &quot;Ac&quot; in four genes, along with the tendency of those genes to unpredictably revert to the wild phenotype. She also identified &quot;families&quot; of transposons, which did not interact with one another.
Her work on controlling elements and gene regulation was conceptually difficult and was not immediately understood or accepted by her contemporaries; she described the reception of her research as &quot;puzzlement, even hostility&quot;. Nevertheless, McClintock continued to develop her ideas on controlling elements. She published a paper in &quot;Genetics&quot; in 1953, where she presented all her statistical data, and undertook lecture tours to universities throughout the 1950s to speak about her work. She continued to investigate the problem and identified a new element that she called &quot;Suppressor-mutator&quot; (&quot;Spm&quot;), which, although similar to &quot;Ac/Ds&quot;, acts in a more complex manner. Like &quot;Ac/Ds&quot;, some versions could transpose on their own and some could not; unlike &quot;Ac/Ds&quot;, when present, it fully suppressed the expression of mutant genes when they normally would not be entirely suppressed. Based on the reactions of other scientists to her work, McClintock felt she risked alienating the scientific mainstream, and from 1953 was forced to stop publishing accounts of her research on controlling elements. Another hypothesis why she stopped publishing is presented by Kass 2024, p. 165).

===The origins of maize===
In 1957, McClintock received funding from the National Academy of Sciences to start research on indigenous strains of maize in Central America and South America. She was interested in studying the evolution of maize through chromosomal changes, and being in South America would allow her to work on a larger scale. McClintock explored the chromosomal, morphological, and evolutionary characteristics of various races of maize. After extensive work in the 1960s and 1970s, McClintock and her collaborators published the seminal study &quot;The Chromosomal Constitution of Races of Maize&quot;, leaving their mark on paleobotany, ethnobotany, and evolutionary biology. See Kass (2024, Chapter 9), for extensive details of McClintock&#x27;s research and influence on the cytogenetics of the Races of Maize in Mexico and South America.

===Rediscovery===
McClintock officially retired from her position at the Carnegie Institution in 1967, and was made a Distinguished Service Member of the Carnegie Institution of Washington. This honor allowed her to continue working with graduate students and colleagues in the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory as &quot;scientist emerita&quot;; she lived in the town. In reference to her decision 20 years earlier to stop publishing detailed accounts of her work on controlling elements, she wrote in 1973:

The importance of McClintock&#x27;s contributions was revealed in the 1960s, when the work of French geneticists François Jacob and Jacques Monod described the genetic regulation of the &quot;lac&quot; operon, a concept she had demonstrated with &quot;Ac/Ds&quot; in 1951. Following Jacob and Monod&#x27;s 1961 &quot;Journal of Molecular Biology&quot; paper &quot;Genetic regulatory mechanisms in the synthesis of proteins&quot;, McClintock wrote an article for &quot;American Naturalist&quot; comparing the &quot;lac&quot; operon and her work on controlling elements in maize. Even late in the twentieth century, McClintock&#x27;s contribution to biology was still not widely acknowledged as amounting to the discovery of genetic regulation. See Kass (2024, pp. 189–191) for clarification of this legend.

McClintock was widely credited with discovering transposition after other researchers finally discovered the process in bacteria, yeast, and bacteriophages in the late 1960s and early 1970s. During this period, molecular biology had developed significant new technology, and scientists were able to show the molecular basis for transposition. In the 1970s, &quot;Ac&quot; and &quot;Ds&quot; were cloned by other scientists and were shown to be class II transposons. &quot;Ac&quot; is a complete transposon that can produce a functional transposase, which is required for the element to move within the genome. &quot;Ds&quot; has a mutation in its transposase gene, which means that it cannot move without another source of transposase. Thus, as McClintock observed, &quot;Ds&quot; cannot move in the absence of &quot;Ac&quot;. &quot;Spm&quot; has also been characterized as a transposon. Subsequent research has shown that transposons typically do not move unless the cell is placed under stress, such as by irradiation or the breakage-fusion-bridge cycle, and thus their activation during stress can serve as a source of genetic variation for evolution. McClintock understood the role of transposons in evolution and genome change well before other researchers grasped the concept. Nowadays, &quot;Ac/Ds&quot; is used as a tool in plant biology to generate mutant plants used for the characterization of gene function.

==Honors and recognition==
In 1947, McClintock received the Achievement Award from the American Association of University Women. She was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1959. In 1967, McClintock was awarded the Kimber Genetics Award; three years later, she was given the National Medal of Science by Richard Nixon in 1970. She was the first woman to be awarded the National Medal of Science.
Cold Spring Harbor named a building in her honor in 1973. She received the Louis and Bert Freedman Foundation Award and the Lewis S. Rosensteil Award in 1978. In 1981, she became the first recipient of the MacArthur Foundation Grant, and was awarded the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research, the Wolf Prize in Medicine and the Thomas Hunt Morgan Medal by the Genetics Society of America. In 1982, she was awarded the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize from Columbia University for her research in the &quot;evolution of genetic information and the control of its expression.&quot;

Most notably, she received the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1983, the first woman to win that prize unshared, and the first American woman to win any unshared Nobel Prize in the sciences. It was given to her by the Nobel Foundation for discovering &quot;mobile genetic elements&quot;; this was more than 30 years after she initially described the phenomenon of controlling elements. She was compared to Gregor Mendel in terms of her scientific career by the Swedish Academy of Sciences when she was awarded the Prize. Nobel Prize awards and their limiations, and the rationale for delayed awards are detailed in Kass (2024, pp. 236–247).

She was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1989. McClintock received the Benjamin Franklin Medal for Distinguished Achievement in the Sciences of the American Philosophical Society in 1993. She had been previously elected to the APS in 1946. She was awarded 14 Honorary Doctor of Science degrees and an Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters. In 1986 she was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame. During her final years, McClintock led a more public life, especially after Evelyn Fox Keller&#x27;s 1983 biography of her, &quot;A Feeling for the Organism,&quot; brought McClintock&#x27;s story to the public. She remained a regular presence in the Cold Spring Harbor community, and gave talks on mobile genetic elements and the history of genetics research for the benefit of junior scientists. An anthology of her 43 publications &quot;The Discovery and Characterization of Transposable Elements: The Collected Papers of Barbara McClintock&quot; was published in 1987.

The McClintock Prize is named in her honor. Laureates of the award include David Baulcombe, Detlef Weigel, Robert A. Martienssen, Jeffrey D. Palmer and Susan R. Wessler.

In May 2005 the U.S. Postal Service issued a panel of first-class stamps honoring Barbara McClintock, along with Richard Feynman, Josiah Willard Gibbs, and John von Neumann.

==Later years==
McClintock spent her later years, post Nobel Prize, as a key leader and researcher in the field at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island, New York. McClintock died of natural causes in Huntington, New York, on September 2, 1992, at the age of 90; she never married or had children.

==Legacy==
McClintock was the subject of a 1983 biography by physicist Evelyn Fox Keller, titled &quot;A Feeling for the Organism&quot;. Keller argued that because McClintock felt like an outsider within her field, (in part, because of her sex) she was able to look at her scientific subjects from a perspective different from the dominant one, leading to several important insights. Keller shows how this led many of her colleagues to reject her ideas and undermine her abilities for many years. For example, when McClintock presented her findings that the genetics of maize did not conform to Mendelian distributions, geneticist Sewall Wright expressed the belief that she did not understand the underlying mathematics of her work, a belief he had also expressed towards other women at the time. In addition, geneticist Lotte Auerbach recounted that Joshua Lederberg returned from a visit to McClintock&#x27;s lab with the remark: &#x27;By God, that woman is either crazy or a genius.&#x27; &quot; As Auerbach recounts, McClintock had thrown Lederberg and his colleagues out after half an hour &#x27;because of their arrogance. She was intolerant of arrogance ... She felt she had crossed a desert alone and no one had followed her.&#x27;&quot;

In 2001, a second biography by science historian Nathaniel C. Comfort&#x27;s &quot;The Tangled Field: Barbara McClintock&#x27;s Search for the Patterns of Genetic Control&quot; challenged this narrative. Comfort&#x27;s biography contests the claim that McClintock was marginalized by other scientists, which he calls the &quot;McClintock Myth&quot; and argues was perpetuated both by McClintock herself as well as in the earlier biography by Keller. Comfort, however, asserts that McClintock was not discriminated against because of her gender, citing that she was well regarded by her professional peers, even in the early years of her career.

Many recent biographical works on women in science feature accounts of McClintock&#x27;s work and experience. She is held up as a role model for girls in such works of children&#x27;s literature as Edith Hope Fine&#x27;s &quot;Barbara McClintock, Nobel Prize Geneticist&quot;, Deborah Heiligman&#x27;s &quot;Barbara McClintock: Alone in Her Field&quot; and Mary Kittredge&#x27;s &quot;Barbara McClintock&quot;. A recent biography for young adults by Naomi Pasachoff, &quot;Barbara McClintock, Genius of Genetics&quot;, provides a new perspective, based on the current literature. The most recent biography of the life and work of Barbara McClintock was published by Lee B. Kass and issued in June 2024 (Kass 2024).

On May 4, 2005, the United States Postal Service issued the &quot;American Scientists&quot; commemorative postage stamp series, a set of four 37-cent self-adhesive stamps in several configurations. The scientists depicted were Barbara McClintock, John von Neumann, Josiah Willard Gibbs, and Richard Feynman. McClintock was also featured in a 1989 four-stamp issue from Sweden which illustrated the work of eight Nobel Prize-winning geneticists. A laboratory building at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory were named for her. A street has been named after her in the new &quot;Adlershof Development Society&quot; science park in Berlin. 

A 103,835 square-foot residence hall at Cornell University was named for McClintock in 2022.

Some of McClintock&#x27;s personality and scientific achievements were referred to in Jeffrey Eugenides&#x27;s 2011 novel &quot;The Marriage Plot,&quot; which tells the story of a yeast geneticist named Leonard who has bipolar disorder. He works at a laboratory loosely based on Cold Spring Harbor. The character reminiscent of McClintock is a reclusive geneticist at the fictional laboratory, who makes the same discoveries as her factual counterpart.

Judith Pratt wrote a play about McClintock, called MAIZE, which was read at Artemesia Theatre in Chicago in 2015, and was produced in Ithaca NY, the home of Cornell University, in February–March 2018.

<doc id="55192" wikidata="Q267127" url="?curid=55192" title="Albula Alps">
<text>The Albula Alps are a mountain range in the Alps of eastern Switzerland. They are considered to be part of the Central Eastern Alps, more specifically the Western Rhaetian Alps. They are named after the river Albula. According to AVE (see map), the Albula Alps are separated from the Oberhalbstein Alps in the west by the Septimer Pass and the valley of the Sursés; from the Plessur Alps in the north-west by the Landwasser valley; from the Silvretta group in the north-east by the Flüela Pass; from the Sesvenna Alps in the east by the Inn valley (Engadine); from the Livigno Alps in the south-east by the Inn valley; from the Bernina Range in the south by the Maloja Pass and the Inn valley.

The chief summit of the Albula Alps is Piz Kesch, which is also the highest summit of the Eastern Alps north of the Inn. Other mountains with both a high elevation and a high prominence are Piz Calderas, Piz Ela, Piz Ot and Piz Vadret. The Albula Alps are drained by the rivers Albula, Gelgia, Landwasser and Inn and Mera. Near the Lunghin Pass is the tripoint between the Gelgia, Inn and Mera. This is the tripoint between the basins of the North Sea, Black Sea and Mediterranean Sea.

The main road passes crossing the Albula Alps (from central Graubünden to Engadin) are the Julier Pass and the Albula Pass. On the margin are also the Flüela Pass and the Septimer Pass (bridle path only). The Albula Pass, in the middle of the range, is also an important axis of the Rhaetian Railway, connecting Chur to St. Moritz through the Albula Tunnel. Both pass road and railway traverse the locality of Bergün on the river Albula, the most central town within the Albula Alps.

==Peaks==
The main peaks of the Albula Alps are:

==Passes==

The Albula Alps are crossed by one railway tunnel, under the Albula Pass. The main mountain passes of the Albula Alps are:

<text>The Lepontine Alps (, , ) are a mountain range in the north-western part of the Alps. They are located in Switzerland (Valais, Ticino, Uri and Graubünden) and Italy (Piedmont and Lombardy).

The Simplon rail tunnel (from Brig to Domodossola), the Gotthard rail (from Erstfeld to Bodio) and Gotthard road tunnels (from Andermatt to Airolo) and the San Bernardino road tunnel are important transport arteries.

The eastern portion of the Lepontine Alps, from the St Gotthard Pass to the Splügen Pass, is named the Adula Alps, while the western part is historically referred to as the Ticino Alps.

== Etymology ==
The designation &quot;Lepontine Alps&quot;, derived from the Latin name of the Valle Leventina, has long been somewhat vaguely applied to the Alpine ranges that enclose it, before being used for the whole range.

==Geography==
Following the line marking the division of the waters that flow into the Po from those that feed the Rhone or the Rhine, the main ridge of the Lepontine Alps describes a somewhat irregular curve, convex to the north, from the Simplon Pass to the Splügen Pass. With the single exception of the Monte Leone, overlooking the Simplon Pass, the summits of this portion of the chain are much inferior in height to those of the neighbouring chains; but two peaks of the Adula group, culminating at the Rheinwaldhorn, exceed in height.

The extensive region lying south of the main ridge is occupied by mountain ranges whose summits sometimes rival in height those of the dividing ridge, and which are cut through by deep valleys, three of which converge in the basins of Lake Maggiore and Lake Como, the deepest of all the lakes on the south side of the Alps. The most important of these valleys is the Valle Leventina, or the upper valley of the Ticino. This has been known from a remote antiquity because it leads to the St Gotthard Pass, one of the easiest lines of communication between northern and southern Europe.

The Lepontine Alps are drained by the rivers Rhône in the west, Reuss in the north, Rhine (Anterior and Posterior Rhine) in the east and Ticino and Toce in the south.

<text>The Adula Alps, also known as the West Graubünden and Misox Alps, are a western Alpine mountain group, the part of the Lepontine Alps from the Lukmanier and St Gotthard Passes to the Splügen Pass.
They lie mostly in Switzerland, in the Cantons of Ticino, Graubünden, and Uri, and partly in Italy, in the province of Sondrio in Lombardy, stretching south to Lake Como. They form subsection 10B of the Alps, according to the &quot;Partizione delle Alpi&quot;, and subsection 10 III, according to the unified orographic classification of the Alps by Sergio Marazzi (SOIUSA).

A string of mountains of the Adula stand on the international border between Switzerland and Italy, including Pizzo Tambò, 
Piz di Pian, Cima de Pian Guarnei (Pizzo Quadro), Cime di Val Loga, Piz Tamborello, Piz della Forcola, Pizzaccio, and Cima dello Stagn, while Pizzo Ferré is near the border on the Italian side.

The mountain guides of the Swiss Alpine Club do not lead climbers in groups for the Adula Alps, but attach parts of them to other sections.
The highest peak is the Rheinwaldhorn (), which in Italian is called the Adula, giving the range its name.

The main valleys are Val Malvaglia, which drains into the lower Blenio Valley, and three others draining south out of the Adula Alps, which are, from west to east, Val Calanca, Valle Mesolcina, and Valle Spluga (or San Giacomo).

The creation of an Adula National Park was planned by Switzerland for sixteen years, from 2000. It would have become only the second in the country, after the Swiss National Park, but in November 2016 the inhabitants voted against it.

<text>The Mössbauer effect, or recoilless nuclear resonance fluorescence, is a physical phenomenon discovered by Rudolf Mössbauer in 1958. It involves the resonant and recoil-free emission and absorption of gamma radiation by atomic nuclei bound in a solid. Its main application is in Mössbauer spectroscopy.

In the Mössbauer effect, a narrow resonance for nuclear gamma emission and absorption results from the momentum of recoil being delivered to a surrounding crystal lattice rather than to the emitting or absorbing nucleus alone. When this occurs, no gamma energy is lost to the kinetic energy of recoiling nuclei at either the emitting or absorbing end of a gamma transition: emission and absorption occur at the same energy, resulting in strong, resonant absorption.

== History ==
The emission and absorption of X-rays by gases had been observed previously. It was expected that a similar phenomenon would be found for gamma rays, which are created by nuclear transitions (as opposed to X-rays, which are typically produced by electronic transitions). However, attempts to observe nuclear resonance produced by gamma rays in gases failed due to energy being lost to recoil, preventing resonance (the Doppler effect also broadens the gamma-ray spectrum). Mössbauer observed resonance in nuclei of solid iridium, which raised the question of why gamma-ray resonance was possible in solids but not in gases. Mössbauer proposed that, for the case of atoms bound into a solid, a fraction of the nuclear events could occur essentially without recoil under certain circumstances. He attributed the observed resonance to this recoil-free fraction of nuclear events.

The Mössbauer effect was one of the last major discoveries in physics to be originally reported in the German language. The first reports in English were a pair of letters describing independent repetitions of the experiment.

The discovery was rewarded with the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1961, together with Robert Hofstadter&#x27;s research of electron scattering in atomic nuclei.

== Description ==

In general, gamma rays are produced by nuclear transitions from an unstable high-energy state to a stable low-energy state. The energy of the emitted gamma ray corresponds to the energy of the nuclear transition, minus an amount of energy that is lost as recoil to the emitting atom. If the lost recoil energy is small compared with the energy linewidth of the nuclear transition, then the gamma-ray energy still corresponds to the energy of the nuclear transition and the gamma ray can be absorbed by a second atom of the same type as the first. This emission and subsequent absorption is called resonant fluorescence. Additional recoil energy is also lost during absorption, so in order for resonance to occur, the recoil energy must actually be less than half the linewidth for the corresponding nuclear transition.

The amount of energy in the recoiling body () can be found from momentum conservation:
: formula_1

where is the momentum of the recoiling matter, and the momentum of the gamma ray. Substituting energy into the equation gives:
: formula_2

where ( for ) is the energy lost as recoil, is the energy of the gamma ray ( for ), ( for ) is the mass of the emitting or absorbing body, and &quot;c&quot; is the speed of light. In the case of a gas, the emitting and absorbing bodies are atoms, so the mass is relatively small, resulting in a large recoil energy, which prevents resonance. (The same equation applies for recoil energy losses in X-rays, but the photon energy is much less, resulting in a lower energy loss, which is why gas-phase resonance could be observed with X-rays.)

In a solid, the nuclei are bound to the lattice and do not recoil as in a gas. The lattice as a whole recoils, but the recoil energy is negligible because the in the above equation is the mass of the entire lattice. However, the energy in a decay can be taken up or supplied by lattice vibrations. The energy of these vibrations is quantised in units known as phonons. The Mössbauer effect occurs because there is a finite probability of a decay involving no phonons. Thus in a fraction of the nuclear events (the recoil-free fraction, given by the Lamb–Mössbauer factor), the entire crystal acts as the recoiling body, and these events are essentially recoil-free. In these cases, since the recoil energy is negligible, the emitted gamma rays have the appropriate energy and resonance can occur.

In general (depending on the half-life of the decay), gamma rays have very narrow line widths. This means they are very sensitive to small changes in the energies of nuclear transitions. In fact, gamma rays can be used as a probe to observe the effects of interactions between a nucleus and its electrons and those of its neighbors. This is the basis for Mössbauer spectroscopy, which combines the Mössbauer effect with the Doppler effect to monitor such interactions.

Zero-phonon optical transitions, a process closely analogous to the Mössbauer effect, can be observed in lattice-bound chromophores at low temperatures.

<text>The Dolomites ( ), also known as the Dolomite Mountains, Dolomite Alps or Dolomitic Alps, are a mountain range in northeastern Italy. They form part of the Southern Limestone Alps and extend from the River Adige in the west to the Piave Valley (Pieve di Cadore) in the east. The northern and southern borders are defined by the Puster Valley and the Sugana Valley (). The Dolomites are in the regions of Veneto, Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol and Friuli-Venezia Giulia, covering an area shared between the provinces of Belluno, Vicenza, Verona, Trentino, South Tyrol, Udine and Pordenone.

Other mountain groups of similar geological structure are spread along the River Piave to the east—; and far away over the Adige River to the west—&quot;Dolomiti di Brenta&quot; (Western Dolomites). A smaller group is called (Little Dolomites), between the provinces of Trentino, Verona and Vicenza.

The Dolomiti Bellunesi National Park and many other regional parks are in the Dolomites. On 26 June 2009, the Dolomites were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Adamello-Brenta UNESCO Global Geopark is also in the Dolomites. The Geological Museum of the Dolomites (in Italian &quot;Museo Geologico delle Dolomiti&quot;) is located in Predazzo, Fiemme Valley.

== Etymology ==
The Dolomites, also known as the &quot;Pale Mountains&quot;, take their name from the carbonate rock dolomite. This was named after the 18th-century French mineralogist Déodat Gratet de Dolomieu (1750–1801), who was the first to describe the mineral.

== History ==

For millennia, hunters and gatherers had advanced into the highest rocky regions and had probably also climbed some peaks. There is evidence that the Jesuit priest Franz von Wulfen from Klagenfurt climbed the Lungkofel and the Dürrenstein in the 1790s. In 1857 Irishman John Ball was the first known person to climb Monte Pelmo. Paul Grohmann later climbed numerous peaks such as the Antelao, Marmolada, Tofana, Monte Cristallo and the Boè. Around 1860 the Agordin mountaineer Simone de Silvestro was the first person to stand on the Civetta. Michael Innerkofler was one of the climbers of the Tre Cime di Lavaredo. Later very important local mountaineers, known for many first ascents, were Angelo Dibona and Giovanni Piaz.

During the First World War, the front line between the Italian and Austro-Hungarian Army ran through the Dolomites, where both sides used mines extensively. Open-air war museums are at Cinque Torri (Five Towers), Monte Piana and Mount Lagazuoi. Many people visit the Dolomites to climb the vie ferrate, protected paths through the rock walls that were created during the war.

A number of long-distance footpaths traverse the Dolomites. They are called ( – high paths), and are numbered 1 to 10. The trails take about a week to walk, and are served by numerous (huts). The first and the most renowned is the Alta Via 1. Radiocarbon dating has been used in the Alta Badia region to demonstrate a connection between landslide activity and climate change.

== Geography ==
The region is commonly divided into the Western and Eastern Dolomites, separated by a line following the Val Badia–Campolongo Pass–Cordevole Valley (Agordino) axis.

=== Current classification ===
The Dolomites may be divided into the following ranges:
* Sella
* Marmolada
* Tofane
* Langkofel Group
* Geisler Group
* Peitlerkofel Group
* Puez Group
* Fanes Group
* Schlern Group
* Rosengarten
* Latemar
* Pala
* Lüsen Mountains
* Civetta
* Pelmo
* Marmarole
* Cadini Group
* Cristallo Group
* Sorapiss
* Antelao
* Bosconero
* Vette Feltrine
* Schiara
* Prags Dolomites
* Sexten Dolomites
* Friulian Dolomites
== Tourism and sports ==

The Dolomites are renowned for skiing in the winter months and mountain climbing, hiking, cycling and BASE jumping, as well as paragliding and hang gliding in summer and late spring/early autumn. Free climbing has been a tradition in the Dolomites since 1887, when 17-year-old Georg Winkler soloed the first ascent of the pinnacle of the Vajolet Towers. The main centres include: Rocca Pietore alongside the Marmolada Glacier, which lies on the border of Trentino and Veneto, the small towns of Alleghe, Falcade, Auronzo, Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo and the villages of Arabba, Urtijëi and San Martino di Castrozza, as well as the whole of the Fassa, Gardena and Badia valleys.

The &quot;Maratona dles Dolomites&quot;, an annual single-day road bicycle race covering seven mountain passes of the Dolomites, occurs in the first week of July.

Other characteristic places are:
* Mount Pasubio and Strada delle 52 Gallerie (a military mule road built during World War I with 52 tunnels)
* Altopiano di Asiago and Calà del Sasso, with 4,444 steps, the world&#x27;s longest staircase open to the public.

<text>The Dauphiné Alps () are a group of mountain ranges in Southeastern France, west of the main chain of the Alps. Mountain ranges within the Dauphiné Alps include the Massif des Écrins in Écrins National Park, Belledonne, Le Taillefer range and the mountains of Matheysine.

== Etymology ==
The &quot;Dauphiné&quot; () is a former French province whose area roughly corresponded to that of the present departments of :Isère, :Drôme, and :Hautes-Alpes.

== Geography ==
They are separated from the Cottian Alps in the east by the Col du Galibier and the upper Durance valley; from the western Graian Alps (Vanoise Massif) in the north-east by the river Arc; from the lower ranges Vercors Plateau and Chartreuse Mountains in the west by the rivers Drac and Isère. Many peaks rise to more than , with Barre des Écrins (4,102 m) the highest.

Administratively the French part of the range belongs to the French departments of Isère, Hautes-Alpes and Savoie.

The whole range is drained by the Rhone through its tributaries.

It has been proposed that the height of mountains in the Dauphiné Alps is limited by the erosion caused by small glaciers, causing a topographic effect called the glacial buzzsaw.

==Peaks==
The chief peaks of the Dauphiné Alps are:

<doc id="55205" wikidata="Q25220" url="?curid=55205" title="Swiss Alps">
<text>The Alpine region of Switzerland, conventionally referred to as the Swiss Alps, represents a major natural feature of the country and is, along with the Swiss Plateau and the Swiss portion of the Jura Mountains, one of its three main physiographic regions. The Swiss Alps extend over both the Western Alps and the Eastern Alps, encompassing an area sometimes called Central Alps. While the northern ranges from the Bernese Alps to the Appenzell Alps are entirely in Switzerland, the southern ranges from the Mont Blanc massif to the Bernina massif are shared with other countries such as France, Italy, Austria and Liechtenstein.

The Swiss Alps comprise almost all the highest mountains of the Alps, such as Dufourspitze (4,634 m), the Dom (4,545 m), the Liskamm (4,527 m), the Weisshorn (4,506 m) and the Matterhorn (4,478 m). The other following major summits can be found in this list of mountains of Switzerland.

Since the Middle Ages, transit across the Alps played an important role in history. The region north of St Gotthard Pass became the nucleus of the Swiss Confederacy in the early 14th century.

==Geography==
The Alps cover 60% of Switzerland&#x27;s total surface area, making it one of the most &quot;alpine&quot; countries. Despite the fact that Switzerland covers only 14% of the Alps total area, 48 out of 82 alpine four-thousanders are located in the Swiss Alps and practically all of the remaining 34 are within of the country&#x27;s border.

The glaciers of the Swiss Alps cover an area of — 3% of the Swiss territory, representing 44% of the total glaciated area in the Alps i.e. .

The Swiss Alps are situated south of the Swiss Plateau and north of the national border. The limit between the Alps and the plateau runs from Vevey on the shores of Lake Geneva to Rorschach on the shores of Lake Constance, passing close to the cities of Thun and Lucerne. The not well defined regions in Switzerland that lie on the margin of the Alps, especially those on the north side, are called the &quot;Swiss Prealps&quot; (&quot;Préalpes&quot; in French, &quot;Voralpen&quot; in German, &quot;Prealpi&quot; in Italian). The Swiss Prealps are mainly made of limestone and they generally do not exceed .

The Alpine cantons (from highest to lowest) are Valais, Bern, Graubünden, Uri, Glarus, Ticino, St. Gallen, Vaud, Obwalden, Nidwalden, Schwyz, Appenzell Innerrhoden, Appenzell Ausserrhoden, Fribourg, Lucerne and Zug. The countries with which Switzerland shares mountain ranges of the Alps are (from west to east): France, Italy, Austria and Liechtenstein.

===Ranges===
The Alps are usually divided into two main parts, the Western Alps and Eastern Alps, whose division is along the Rhine from Lake Constance to the Splügen Pass. The western ranges occupy the greatest part of Switzerland while the more numerous eastern ranges are much smaller and are all situated in the canton of Graubünden. The latter is part of the Central Eastern Alps, except the Ortler Alps which belong to the Southern Limestone Alps. The Pennine, Bernese and Bernina Range are the highest ranges of the country, they contain respectively 38, 9 and 1 summit over 4000 meters. The lowest range is the Appenzell Alps culminating at 2,500 meters.

===Hydrography===
====Rivers====
The north side of the Swiss Alps is drained by the Rhône, Rhine and Inn (which is part of the Danube basin) while the south side is mainly drained by the Ticino (Po basin). The rivers on the north empty into the Mediterranean, North and Black Sea, on the south the Po empty in the Adriatic Sea. The major triple watersheds in the Alps are located within the country, they are: Piz Lunghin, Witenwasserenstock and Monte Forcola. Between the Witenwasserenstock and Piz Lunghin runs the European Watershed separating the basin of the Atlantic (the North Sea) and the Mediterranean Sea (Adriatic and the Black Sea). The European watershed lies only partially on the main chain. Switzerland possesses 6% of Europe&#x27;s freshwater, and is sometimes referred to as the &quot;water tower of Europe&quot;.

====Lakes====
Since the highest dams are located in Alpine regions, many large mountain lakes are artificial and are used as hydroelectric reservoirs. Some large artificial lakes can be found above 2,300 m, but natural lakes larger than 1 km2 are generally below 1,000 m (with the exceptions of lakes in the Engadin such as Lake Sils, and Oeschinen in the Bernese Oberland). The melting of low-altitude glaciers can generate new lakes, such as the 0.25 km2 large Triftsee which formed between 2002 and 2003.

===Hydroelectricity Impacts due to Glacial Melting===
Switzerland has been using this concerning transition in climate as a positive opportunity to develop new innovations and to change the ways that energy is being produced in the country. Switzerland depends on the use of hydroelectricity to power nearby communities, but as glaciers melt and stop refreezing, the melting that creates the energy ceases to exist. Researchers have been evaluating how the topography will change as the glaciers begin to decrease and they are looking more deeply into potential construction costs, energy production, and future problems they might encounter with these new developments. Switzerland is one of many countries that need to begin to think about the future of energy production in response to climate change. Switzerland is paving the way for a new wave of innovation and creative problem solving that the rest of the world will eventually need to follow.
===Land elevation===

The following table gives the surface area above 2000 m and 3000 m and the respective percentage on the total area of each canton whose high point is above 2000 metres.

===Monitoring glacial changes over time===
PERMOS (The Swiss Permafrost Monitoring Network) is an operational monitoring service, and its main goal is to create long-term scientific documentation of the permafrost changes in the Swiss Alps. To accurately represent the current conditions of the Alps, the network records permafrost temperatures and thermal changes in boreholes, the bottom temperature of the snow cover, ground surface temperature, and the development of snow cover. The network additionally takes air photos periodically from selected areas. These monitoring strategies continue to develop as new research and data are recorded over time. The glaciers in the Swiss Alps have lost around half their volume during the last 90–120 years.

==Geology==


The composition of the great tectonic units reflects the history of the formation of the Alps. The rocks from the Helvetic zone on the north and the Austroalpine nappes – Southern Alps on the south come originally from the European and African continent respectively. The rocks of the Penninic nappes belong to the former area of the Briançonnais microcontinent and the Tethys Ocean. The closure of the latter by subduction under the African plate (Piemont Ocean first and Valais Ocean later) preceded the collision between the two plates and the so-called alpine orogeny. The major thrust fault of the Tectonic Arena Sardona in the eastern Glarus Alps gives a visible illustration of mountain-building processes and was therefore declared a UNESCO World Heritage. Another fine example gives the Alpstein area with several visible upfolds of Helvetic zone material.

With some exceptions, the Alps north of Rhône and Rhine are part of the Helvetic Zone and those on the south side are part of the Penninic nappes. The Austroalpine zone concerns almost only the Eastern Alps, with the notable exception of the Matterhorn.

The last glaciations greatly transformed Switzerland&#x27;s landscape. Many valleys of the Swiss Alps are U-shaped due to glacial erosion. During the maximum extension of the Würm glaciation (18,000 years ago) the glaciers completely covered the Swiss Plateau, before retreating and leaving remnants only in high mountain areas. In modern times the Aletsch Glacier in the western Bernese Alps is the largest and longest in the Alps, reaching a maximum depth of 900 meters at Konkordiaplatz. Along with the Fiescher and Aar Glaciers, the region became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2001. An effect of the retreat of the Rhine Glacier some 10,000 years ago was the Flims Rockslide, the biggest still visible landslide worldwide.

==Environment and climate==
To protect endangered species some sites have been brought under protection. The Swiss National Park in Graubünden was established in 1914 as the first alpine national park. The Entlebuch area was designated a biosphere reserve in 2001. The largest protected area in the country is the Parc Ela, opened in 2006, which covers an area of 600 square kilometres. The Jungfrau-Aletsch Protected Area is the first World Heritage Site in the Alps.

===Climate zones===
As the temperature decreases with altitude (0.56 °C per 100 meters on yearly average), three different altitudinal zones, each having distinct climate, are found in the Swiss Alps:

*Subalpine zone
The Subalpine zone is the region that lies below the tree line. It is the most important region as it is the largest of the three and contains almost all human settlements as well as the productive areas. The forests are mainly composed of conifers above 1,200–1,400 meters, the deciduous tree forest is confined to lower elevations. The upper limit of the Subalpine zone is located at about 1,800 meters on the north side of the Alps and about 2,000 meters on the south side. It can, however, differ in some regions such as the Appenzell Alps (1,600 meters) or the Engadin valley (2,300 meters).

*Alpine zone
The Alpine zone is situated above the tree line and is clear of trees due to low average temperatures. It contains mostly grass and small plants along with mountain flowers. Below the permafrost limit (at about 2,600 meters), the alpine meadows are often used as pastures. Some villages can still be found on the lowest altitudes such as Riederalp (1,940 m) or Juf (2,130 m). The extent of the Alpine zone is limited by the first permanent snow, its altitude greatly varies depending on the location (and orientation), it comprises between 2,800 and 3,200 meters.

*Glacial zone
The glacial zone is the area of permanent snow and ice. When the steepness of the slope is not too high it results in an accumulation and compaction of snow, which transforms into ice. The glacier-formed then flows down the valley and can reach as far down as 1,500 meters (the Upper Grindelwald Glacier). Where the slopes are too steep, the snow accumulates to form overhanging seracs, which periodically fall off due to the downward movement of the glacier and cause ice avalanches. The Bernese Alps, Pennine Alps, and Mont Blanc Massif contain most of the glaciated areas in the Alps. Except for research stations such as the Sphinx Observatory, no settlements are to be found in those regions.
===Impact of glacial melting===
Due to the change in weather patterns, the summers are expected to continue getting warmer and drier, while the winters are expected to become moister. This change in the weather increases the chances of flooding with heavier rainfall, the melting of permafrost zones, a change in the geography and wildlife, and the occurrence of more deadly rock slides. Furthermore, natural hazards are occurring more frequently, such as floods, avalanches, and landslides. Additionally, the water supply that the glaciers originally provided is on the decline, which is problematic for producing energy, agricultural practices, and other human use. Finally, the glacial melting puts the economy at risk because there will be less incoming financial revenue from the tourism and recreation services that these glaciers and ecosystems typically provide. All of these impacts will disrupt the nearby communities and require that updated infrastructure and safety measures be put into place to prevent mass destruction. 

==Travel and tourism==
Tourism in the Swiss Alps began with the first ascents of the main peaks of the Alps (Jungfrau in 1811, Piz Bernina in 1850, Monte Rosa in 1855, Matterhorn in 1856, Dom in 1858, Weisshorn in 1861) mostly by British mountain climbers accompanied by the local guides. The construction of facilities for tourists started in the mid-nineteenth century with the building of hotels and mountain huts (creation of the Swiss Alpine Club in 1863) and the opening of mountain train lines (Rigi in 1873, Pilatus in 1889, Gornergrat in 1898). The Jungfraubahn opened in 1912; it leads to the highest railway station in Europe, the Jungfraujoch.

===Summer tourism===
Switzerland enjoys a 62,000-km network of well-maintained trails, of which 23,000 are located in mountainous areas. Many mountains attract a large number of alpinists from around the world, especially the 4000-meter summits and the great north faces (Eiger, Matterhorn and Piz Badile). The large winter resorts are also popular destinations in summer, as most of aerial tramways operate through the year, enabling hikers and mountaineers to reach high altitudes without much effort. The Klein Matterhorn is the highest summit of the European continent to be served by cable car.

===Winter tourism===
The major destinations for skiing and other winter sports are located in Valais, Bernese Oberland and Graubünden. Some villages are car-free and can be accessed only with public transports such as Riederalp and Bettmeralp. Zermatt and Saas-Fee have both summer ski areas. The ski season starts from as early as November and runs to as late as May; however, the majority of ski resorts in Switzerland tend to open in December and run through to April. The most visited places are:
*Davos – Klosters GR
*Zermatt VS (car-free village)
*Engadin – St. Moritz GR
*Lenzerheide – Arosa GR
*Jungfrauregion: Grindelwald – Mürren – Wengen BE (car-free villages)
*Les quatre vallées: Verbier – Nendaz VS
*LAAX: Flims – Laax GR
*Aletsch Arena: Riederalp – Bettmeralp – Fiesch VS (car-free villages)
*Les Portes du Soleil: Champéry – Morgins – Les Crosets VS and Avoriaz in France
*Adelboden – Lenk BE
*Val d&#x27;Anniviers: Grimentz – Zinal – Vercorin – St-Luc – Chandolin VS
*Gstaad: Gstaad – Saanen – Saanenmöser – Zweisimmen BE – Rougemont – Chateau-d&#x27;Oex VD
*Silvretta Arena: Samnaun GR and Ischgl in Austria
*Crans Montana VS
*Saas-Fee VS

Other important destinations on the regional level are Engelberg-Titlis (Central Switzerland / OW) and Gotthard Oberalp Arena with Andermatt (Central Switzerland / UR) and Sedrun (GR), Leysin-Les Mosses, Villars-sur-Ollon, Les Diablerets-Glacier 3000 (all VD), Leukerbad (VS), Savognin, Scuol, Obersaxen, Breil/Brigels (all GR), Meiringen – Hasliberg (BE), Sörenberg (LU), Klewenalp with Beckenried and Emmetten (both NW), Melchsee-Frutt (OW), Flumserberg and Pizol (both Sarganserland in SG), Toggenburg with Wildhaus – Unterwasser – Alt St. Johann (SG), Hoch-Ybrig and Stoos (all SZ), Braunwald and Elm (GL), Airolo and Bosco/Gurin (TI) and many more.

The first person to ski in Grindelwald, Switzerland was Englishmen Gerald Fox (a resident of Tone Dale House in England) who put his skis on in his hotel bedroom in 1881 and walked out through the hotel Bar to the slopes wearing them.

===Snow activities===

Some major sporting activities include: 
*Skiing
*Snowboarding
*Snow sled-biking
*Downhill snow Mountain Biking
*Snowmobiling (as well as snowmobile tours and rides)

===Climate change===
Climate change is impacting European Alpine tourism due to the increasing number and intensity of natural hazards, and it is endangering the accessibility and infrastructure of tourism destinations. Melting glaciers are affecting the attractiveness of the Alpine landscape, increasing winter temperatures will result in a shorter skiing season, and these climate changes are limiting the amount of snow coverage produced. All of these climate and geographical factors are leading to a smaller number of visitors and reduced revenues which can have an intense economic impact on winter tourism. In response to these changes, Switzerland has turned to the production of artificial snow to match the demand for these tourist destinations and to uphold the structure and well-being of the economy.

===Transport===


The Swiss Alps and Switzerland enjoy an extensive transport network. Virtually every mountain village can be reached by public transport, either by rail, bus, funicular, cable car, or usually a combination of them. The main companies of the coherently integrated public transport system are:

*Swiss Federal Railways (SBB CFF FFS)
*Rhaetian Railway (RhB)
*Matterhorn Gotthard Bahn (MGB)
*GoldenPass Line
*PostBus (PostAuto / CarPostal / AutoPostale / Auto da Posta)

Most of the mountain regions are within 1 to 3 hours travel of Switzerland&#x27;s main cities and their respective airport. The Engadine in Graubünden is between 3 and 6 hours away from the large cities; the train journey itself, with the panoramic Glacier Express or Bernina Express, is popular with tourists.

The Engadin Airport near St. Moritz at an altitude of 1,704 meters is the highest in Europe.

The crossing of the Alps is a key issue at national and international levels, as the European continent is at places divided by the range. Since the beginning of industrialisation Switzerland has improved its transalpine network; it began in 1882, by building the Gotthard Rail Tunnel, followed in 1906 by the Simplon Tunnel and 1913 by the Lötschberg Tunnel, and more recently, in 2007, by the Lötschberg Base Tunnel. The 57.1-km long Gotthard Base Tunnel, the longest railway tunnel of the world, opened in 2016 and provides a direct flat rail link through the Alps.

==Toponymy==
The different names of the mountains and other landforms are named in the four national languages. The table below gives the most recurrent names.

Also, a large number of peaks outside the Alps were named or nicknamed after Swiss mountains, such as the Wetterhorn Peak in Colorado or the Matterhorn Peak in California (see the Matterhorn article for a list of &quot;Matterhorns in the world&quot;).

The confluence of the Baltoro Glacier and the Godwin-Austen Glacier south of K2 in the Karakoram range was named after the Konkordiaplatz by European explorers.

<text>The Maritime Alps ( ; ) are a mountain range in the southwestern part of the Alps. They form the border between the French region of Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur and the Italian regions of Piedmont and Liguria. They are the southernmost part of the Alps.

== Geography ==
Administratively the range is divided between the Italian provinces of Cuneo and Imperia (eastern slopes) and the French department of Alpes-Maritimes (western slopes).

The Maritime Alps are drained by the rivers Roya, Var and Verdon and their tributaries on the French side; by the Stura di Demonte and other tributaries of the Tanaro and Po on the Italian side. There are many attractive perched villages, such as Belvédère at the entrance to the spectacular Gordolasque valley, some concealing unexpected architectural riches (for example in the south there are numerous churches decorated with murals and altarpieces by primitive Niçois painters).

=== Borders ===
The borders of the Maritime Alps are as follows (clockwise):
* Vermenagna creek, Col de Tende - which connects them with the Ligurian Alps - and Roya (east);
* Mediterranean Sea and Var valley (south)
* Verdon, Col d&#x27;Allos - which connects them with Provence Alps and Prealps - and Ubaye (west);
* Maddalena Pass (which connects them with the Cottian Alps) and Stura di Demonte (north).

==Peaks==
The main peaks of the Maritime Alps are:
==Mountain passes==

The chief passes of the Maritime Alps are:
== Nature conservation ==

The French Mercantour National Park (central area:68,500 ha + peripheral area:140,000 ha) is part of the Maritime Alps as well as the Maritime Alps Natural Park, an Italian regional nature park of 28,455 ha.

<text>The Glarus Alps () are a mountain range in central Switzerland. They are bordered by the Uri Alps and the Schwyz Alps to the west, the Lepontine Alps to the south, the Appenzell Alps to the northeast. The eastern part of the Glarus Alps contains a major thrust fault that was declared a geologic UNESCO World Heritage Site (the Swiss Tectonic Arena Sardona).

The Glarus Alps extend well beyond the canton of Glarus, including parts of the cantons of Uri, Graubünden, and St Gallen. Conversely, not all the mountains in the canton of Glarus are part of the Glarus Alps, with those to the north of the Urner Boden and to the west of the valley of the river Linth considered to be part of the Schwyz Alps.

==Geography==
The main chain of the Glarus Alps can be divided into six minor groups, separated from each other by passes, the lowest of which exceeds 7,500 ft. The westernmost of these is the Crispalt, a rugged range including many peaks of nearly equal height. The highest of these are the Piz Giuv (3,096 m) and Piz Nair. The name &quot;Crispalt&quot; is given to a southern, but secondary, peak of Piz Giuv, measuring 3,070 m. West of the main group is the Rienzenstock, while a northern outlier culminates in the Bristen. East of the Crispalt, the Chrüzli Pass separates this from the rather higher mass of the Oberalpstock (3,328 m).

Here occurs a partial break in the continuity of the chain. The crest of the snowy range connecting the Oberalpstock with the Tödi nowhere sinks to 9,000 feet, but makes a sweep convex to the north, forming a semicircular recess, whose numerous torrents are all poured into the Rhine through the Val Russein below Disentis. Two glacier passes lead over this part of the chain — one to west, over the Brunnigletscher to the Maderanertal; the other to the north-east, over the Sand Glacier, to the Linthal.
The Tödi, the highest of the range and of north-eastern Switzerland (3,614 m), is attended by numerous secondary peaks that arise from the extensive snow-fields surrounding the central mountain. A very considerable outlyer, whose chief summits are the Schärhorn and the Gross Windgällen, belonging to the canton of Uri, is connected with the Tödi by the range of the Clariden , north to the Hüfi Glacier. A less important branch encloses the Biferten Glacier, and terminates in the Selbsanft, south of Tierfehd. Towards the valley of the Vorderrhein a high promontory stretches nearly due south from the central peaks of the Tödi, and is crowned by the summit of the Piz Posta Biala. Another considerable ramification of the same mass terminates farther to the east in the peak of the Cavistrau.

The Kisten Pass separates the Tödi group from the Hausstock, whose summit attains 3,158 m; a branch of this latter group forms the range of the Kärpf in the canton of Glarus. The Hausstock is cut off from the rather lower but more extended mass of the Vorab by the Panixer Pass (7,907 ft). Numerous summits, of which the Vorab proper and Piz Grisch are the most important, approach very near, but do not quite attain to 10,000 feet.

The eastern limit of the latter group is marked by the — the most frequented of those connecting the Canton Glarus with the Vorderrhein — beyond which arises a wide-stretching mass of rock and glacier, which is part of the Glarus thrust and culminates at Piz Sardona. This mass is cleft by a deep valley — the Calfeisental: one branch, culminating in the Pizol (2,844 m), extends east over Pfäfers, while another, including the highest peak of the canton of St. Gallen, the Ringelspitz (3,247 m), runs due east to the low Kunkels Pass (1,357 m), separating this range from the Calanda.

<doc id="55208" wikidata="Q1251" url="?curid=55208" title="Cottian Alps">
<text>The Cottian Alps (; ; ) are a mountain range in the southwestern part of the Alps. They form the border between France (Hautes-Alpes and Savoie) and Italy (Piedmont). The Fréjus Road Tunnel and Fréjus Rail Tunnel between Modane and Susa are important transportation arteries between France (Lyon, Grenoble) and Italy (Turin).

== Etymology ==

The name &quot;Cottian&quot; comes from &quot;Marcus Julius Cottius&quot;, a king of the tribes inhabiting that mountainous region in the 1st century BC. Under his father Donnus, these tribes had previously opposed but later made peace with Julius Caesar. Cottius was succeeded by his son Gaius Julius Donnus II (reigned 3 BC-4 AD), and his grandson Marcus Julius Cottius II (reigned 5-63 AD), who was granted the title of king by the emperor Claudius. On his death, Nero annexed his kingdom as the province of Alpes Cottiae.

== History ==
For a long part of the Middle Ages the Cottian Alps were divided between the Duchy of Savoy, which controlled their northern part and the easternmost slopes, and the Dauphiné, which at the time was independent from France. The &quot;Dauphins&quot; also held, in addition to the southwestern slopes of the range (Briançon and Queyras, now on the French side), the upper part of some of the valleys that were tributaries of the Po River (Valle di Susa, Chisone valley, Varaita Valley). The Alpine territory of Dauphiné, known as &quot;Escartons&quot;, used to have a limited autonomy and elected its own parliament. This semi-autonomous status lasted also after the annexation of the Dauphiné to France (1349), and was only abolished in 1713 due to the Treaty of Utrecht, which assigned to the House of Savoy all the mountainous area on the eastern side of the Cottian Alps.

After the treaty annexing Nice and Savoy to France, signed in Turin in March 1860 (Treaty of Turin), the north-western slopes of the range became part of the French republic.

Two eastern valleys of the Cottian Alps (Pellice and Germanasca) have been for centuries a kind of sanctuary for the Waldensians, a Christian movement that was persecuted as heretical from the 12th century onwards by the catholic church.

== Geography ==
Administratively the range is divided between the Italian province of Cuneo and the Metropolitan City of Turin (the eastern slopes), and the French departments of Savoie, Hautes-Alpes, and Alpes-de-Haute-Provence (the western slopes).

The Cottian Alps are drained by the rivers Durance and Arc and their tributaries on the French side; and by the Dora Riparia and other tributaries of the Po on the Italian side.

=== Borders ===
The borders of the Cottian Alps are (clockwise):
* the Maddalena Pass to the south, which connects the Cottian Alps with the Maritime Alps;
* the Ubayette Valley, the Ubaye Valley, the Serre-Ponçon Lake, the high Durance Valley, and the Guisane Valley to the southwest;
* the Col du Galibier to the west, which connects the Cottian Alps with the Dauphiné Alps;
* the Valloirette Valley, the Maurienne Valley, and the Chardoux Creek to the northwest;
* the Mont Cenis Pass to the north, which connects the Cottian Alps with the Graian Alps;
* Mont Cenis Lake, the Cenischia Valley, the Dora Riparia Valley, the Po Plain, and the Varaita Valley to the east.

<text>The Pennine Alps (, , , ), sometimes referred to as the Valais Alps (which are just the Northern Swiss part of the Pennine Alps), are a mountain range in the western part of the Alps. They are located in Italy (the Aosta Valley and Piedmont) and Switzerland (Valais).

The Pennine Alps are amongst the three highest major subranges of the Alps, together with the Bernese Alps and the Graian Alps that include the Mont Blanc massif.

== Geography ==
The Italian side is drained by the rivers Dora Baltea, Sesia and Toce, tributaries of the Po. The Swiss side is drained by the Rhône.

The Great St Bernard Tunnel, under the Great St Bernard Pass, leads from Martigny, Switzerland to Aosta.

==Morphology==
The main chain (watershed between the Mediterranean Sea and the Adriatic Sea) runs from west to east on the border between Italy (south) and Switzerland (north). From Mont Vélan, the first high summit east of St Bernard Pass, the chain rarely goes below 3000 metres and contains many four-thousanders such as Matterhorn or Monte Rosa. The valleys are quite similar on both side of the border, being generally oriented perpendicular to the main chain and descending progressively into the Rhône Valley on the north and the Aosta Valley on the south. Unlike many other mountain ranges, the higher peaks are often located outside the main chain and found themselves between the northern valleys (Grand Combin, Weisshorn, Mischabel, Weissmies).

<text>The Bernese Alps are a mountain range of the Alps located in western Switzerland. Although the name suggests that they are located in the Berner Oberland region of the canton of Bern, portions of the Bernese Alps are in the adjacent cantons of Valais, Fribourg and Vaud, the latter being usually named &quot;Fribourg Alps&quot; and &quot;Vaud Alps&quot; respectively. The highest mountain in the range, the Finsteraarhorn, is also the highest point in the canton of Bern.

The Rhône valley separates them from the Chablais Alps in the west and from the Pennine Alps in the south; the upper Rhône valley separates them from the Lepontine Alps to the southeast; the Grimsel Pass and the Aare valley separates them from the Uri Alps in the east, and from the Emmental Alps in the north; their northwestern edge is not well defined, describing a line roughly from Lake Geneva to Lake Thun. The Bernese Alps are drained by the river Aare and its tributary the Saane in the north, the Rhône in the south, and the Reuss in the east.

The Bernese Alps are amongst the three highest major subranges of the Alps, together with the Pennine Alps and the Mont Blanc massif.

==Geography==
One of the most prominent Alpine ranges, the Bernese Alps extend from the gorge of Saint-Maurice, through which the Rhône finds its way to Lake Geneva, to the Grimsel Pass or, depending on the definition, to the river Reuss (thus including the Uri Alps). The principal ridge, a chain that runs from west (Dent de Morcles) to east (Sidelhorn), whose highest peak is the Finsteraarhorn, forms the watershed between the cantons of Bern and Valais. Except for the westernmost part, it is also the watershed between the Rhine (North Sea) and the Rhône (Mediterranean Sea). This chain is not centered inside the range but lies close (10 to 15 km) to the Rhône on the south. This makes a large difference between the south, where the lateral short valleys descend abruptly into the deep trench forming the valley of the Rhône and the north, where the Bernese Alps extends through a great part of the canton of Bern (Bernese Oberland), throwing out branches to the west into the adjoining cantons of Vaud and Fribourg. There the mountains progressively become lower and disappear into the hilly Swiss Plateau. The Bernese Alps have a large influence on the climate of Switzerland: while their north side is very exposed to weather, their south side is protected from it. As a consequence, agriculture consists essentially of dairy farming and cattle breeding on the northern foothills, while on the sunnier southern foothills (Rhone Valley) it also consists of vineyards.

Gemmi Pass is the most central of the major passes through the main chain. It also marks the separation between two distinct sections of the Bernese Alps: the chain west of Gemmi Pass, consisting mainly of foothills with a few large glacier-covered mountains (notably Dent de Morcles, Grand Muveran, Diablerets, Wildhorn and Wildstrubel) around , and the chain east of Gemmi Pass, consisting mainly of summits around on several subranges, with large valley glaciers between them. The latter section, contrary to the former, has very few foothills and is the most glaciated part of the Alps.

A characteristic in the orography of the Bernese Alps is, that whereas the western portion of that chain consists of a single series of summits with comparatively short projecting buttresses, the higher group presents a series of longitudinal ridges parallel to the axis of the main chain, and separated from each other by deep valleys that form the channels of great glaciers. Thus the Tschingel Glacier and the Kander Glacier, separate the portion of the main range lying between the Gemmi Pass and the Mittaghorn from the equally high parallel range of the Doldenhorn and Blümlisalp on its northern side. To the south, the same portion of the main range is divided from the still higher parallel range whose summits are the Aletschhorn and the Bietschhorn by the Lötschental and the Lötschenlücke. To this again succeeds the deep trench through which the lower part of the Aletsch Glacier flows down to the Rhône, enclosed by the minor ridge that culminates at the Eggishorn.

It is in the central and eastern portions of the range only that crystalline rocks make their appearance; the western part is composed almost exclusively of sedimentary deposits, and the secondary ridges extending through Bern and the adjoining cantons are formed of jurassic, cretaceous, or eocene strata.

==Exploration==

The beauty of the scenery and the facilities offered to travellers by the general extension of mountain railways make the northern side of the range, the Bernese Oberland, one of the portions of the Alps most visited by tourists. Since strangers first began to visit the Alps, the names of Grindelwald, Lauterbrunnen, and Interlaken have become famous. But unlike many other Alpine regions, which have been left to be explored by strangers, this region has been long visited by Swiss travellers and men of science. Among them were the brother Meyer of Aarau and Franz Joseph Hugi. They have explored most of the mountain ranges not very difficult to access, and have climbed most of the higher summits. In 1841, Louis Agassiz, with several scientific friends, established a temporary station on the Unteraar Glacier, and, along with scientific observations on the glaciers, started a series of expeditions. Several mountains in the area are named after Agassiz and the other explorers. The works of Desor and Gottlieb Studer have been followed by several other publications that bear testimony to Swiss mountaineering activity. Notwithstanding the activity of their predecessors, the members of the English Alpine Club have found scope for further exploits, amongst which may be reckoned the first ascents of the Aletschhorn and the Schreckhorn, and the still more arduous enterprise of crossing the range bypasses, such as the Jungfraujoch and Eigerjoch, which are considered among the most difficult in the Alps.

== Jungfrau-Aletsch area ==
The Jungfrau-Aletsch area is located in the eastern Bernese Alps in the most glaciated region of the Alps. It was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site (&quot;Swiss Alps Jungfrau-Aletsch&quot;) in 2001 and further expanded in 2007. Its name comes from the Aletsch Glacier and the two summits of the Jungfrau and Bietschhorn, which constitute some of the most impressive features of the site. The actual site (after the extension) includes other large glacier valleys such as the Fiescher Glacier and the Aar Glaciers.

<text>The Graian Alps ( ; ) are a mountain range in the western part of the Alps.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Graie&quot; comes from the &quot;Graioceli&quot; Celtic tribe, which dwelled in the area surrounding the Mont Cenis pass and the Viù valley.
Other sources claim that the name comes from the Celtic &quot;Graig&quot; meaning &quot;rock&quot; or &quot;stone&quot;, literally the Rocky Mountains.

== Geography ==
The Graian Alps are located in France (Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes), Italy (Piedmont and the Aosta Valley), and Switzerland (western Valais).

The French side of the Graian Alps is drained by the river Isère (Tarentaise valley) and its tributary Arc (Maurienne valley), and by the Arve. The Italian side is drained by the rivers Dora Riparia, Dora Baltea, Orco and Stura di Lanzo, tributaries of the Po.

The Graian Alps can also be divided into the following four groups:

* the Mont Blanc group (north of the Little St Bernard Pass), including the Beaufortain Massif
* the Central group (the watershed between the Little St Bernard Pass and the Col du Mont Cenis)
* the Western or French group,
* and the Eastern or Italian group, including the Gran Paradiso Massif.

==Peaks==
The main peaks of the Graian Alps are:

===Mont Blanc group===

=== Central group ===
It also includes Roche Michel at 3429 m.

===Eastern group===

===Western group===

==Passes==
The main passes of the Graian Alps are shown in the table below. The group in which the pass is located is indicated with &quot;MB&quot; for Mont Blanc group, &quot;C&quot; for Central group, &quot;E&quot; for Eastern group, and &quot;W&quot; for Western group.

== Nature conservation ==

The western group contains the Vanoise National Park, established in 1972 and covering the eastern group contains the Gran Paradiso National Park, the oldest Italian national park.
Also on the Italian side is located the &quot;Parco Regionale del Monte Avic&quot;, a nature park of 5,747 ha established by Regione Valle d&#x27;Aosta.
