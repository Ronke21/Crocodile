<text>A poet laureate (plural: poets laureate) is a poet officially appointed by a government or conferring institution, typically expected to compose poems for special events and occasions. Albertino Mussato of Padua and Francesco Petrarca (Petrarch) of Arezzo were the first to be crowned poets laureate after the classical age, respectively in 1315 and 1342. In Britain, the term dates from the appointment of Bernard André by Henry VII of England. The royal office of Poet Laureate in England dates from the appointment of John Dryden in 1668.

In modern times a poet laureate title may be conferred by an organization such as the Poetry Foundation, which designates a Young People&#x27;s Poet Laureate, unconnected with the National Youth Poet Laureate and the United States Poet Laureate.

The office is also popular with regional and community groups. Examples include the Pikes Peak Poet Laureate, which is designated by a &quot;Presenting Partners&quot; group from within the community, the Minnesota poet laureate chosen by the League of Minnesota Poets (est. 1934), the Northampton Poet Laureate chosen by the Northampton Arts Council, and the Martha&#x27;s Vineyard Poet Laureate chosen by ten judges representing the Martha&#x27;s Vineyard Poetry Society.

== Background ==
In ancient Greece, the laurel was used to form a crown or wreath of honour for poets and heroes. The custom derives from the ancient myth of Daphne and Apollo (Daphne signifying &quot;laurel&quot; in Greek), and was revived in Padua for Albertino Mussato, followed by Petrarch&#x27;s own crowning ceremony in the audience hall of the medieval senatorial palazzo on the Campidoglio on April 8, 1341. Because the Renaissance figures who were attempting to revive the Classical tradition lacked detailed knowledge of the Roman precedent they were attempting to emulate, these ceremonies took on the character of doctoral candidatures. In Persia, the poet laureate (&quot;amīr-&quot; or &quot;malek-al-šoʿarāʾ&quot;) carried artistic authority and were provided sources of income.

Since the office of poet laureate has become widely adopted, the term &quot;laureate&quot; has come to signify recognition for preeminence or superlative achievement (cf. Nobel laureate). A royal degree in rhetoric, &quot;poet laureate&quot; was awarded at European universities in the Middle Ages. The term therefore may refer to the holder of such a degree, which recognized skill in rhetoric, grammar, and language. During England&#x27;s seventeenth century, the poet laureate served as the &quot;court poet&quot; of royalty, and was often called upon to celebrate state occasions until that role was abolished during the early 1800s. The &quot;skald&quot; in ancient Scandinavia often spent their careers too serving as the court poets of Norway&#x27;s kings. Just like the first English poet laureates, ministers during China&#x27;s feudal era presented &quot;commanded poems&quot; at royal events and were beholden to the ruling class. In Japan, the poet laureate (&quot;keikanshijin&quot;) was also imperially appointed and were often called upon to read at the annual Utakai Hajime. Comparatively, in Africa, kingdoms such as the Kuba in the Belgian Congo (modern day Democratic Republic of the Congo) appointed bards that served as both the royal historian and poet laureate. In addition to being known as poet laureates, bards were also referred to as &quot;praise-poets&quot; due to their special function of venerating the chief.

In the Xhosa language, &quot;Imbongi YeSizwethe&quot; can be translated to mean either &quot;poet laureate&quot; or &quot;national poet&quot;. Similar to what is expressed in the Xhosa term, some poets have been dually noted as &quot;poet laureate&quot; and &quot;national poet&quot; depending upon the source: Kazi Nazrul Islam (Bangladesh), Rabindranath Tagore (India), José Craveirinha (Mozambique), Mahmoud Darwish (Palestine), Mohamed Ibrahim Warsame &#x27;Hadrawi&#x27; (Somalia), Edwin Thumboo (Singapore) and Taras Shevchenko (Ukraine). This contrasts with other figures such as Shamsur Rahman (Bangladesh), Thomas Moore (Bermuda), Francisco Borja da Costa (Timor–Leste) and Haji Gora Haji (Zanzibar)—who are conferred an &quot;unofficial poet laureate&quot; status due to their poetical works.

As of modern times, over a dozen national governments continue the poet laureate tradition.

===== England =====

In England, the term &quot;poet laureate&quot; is restricted to the official office of Poet Laureate, attached to the royal household. However, no authoritative historical record exists of the office of Poet Laureate of England.

The office developed from earlier practice when minstrels and versifiers were members of the king&#x27;s retinue. Richard Cœur-de-Lion had a &quot;versificator regis&quot; (English: &quot;king&#x27;s poet&quot;), Gulielmus Peregrinus (William the Pilgrim), and Henry III had a &quot;versificator&quot; named Master Henry. In the fifteenth century, John Kay, a versifier, described himself as Edward IV&#x27;s &quot;humble poet laureate&quot;. According to &quot;Notes and Queries&quot; (1876), King Henry I paid 10 shillings a year to a &quot;versificator regis&quot;.

Geoffrey Chaucer (1340–1400) was called Poet Laureate, being granted in 1389 an annual allowance of wine. W. Hamilton describes Chaucer, Gower, Kay, Andrew Bernard, John Skelton, Robert Whittington, Richard Edwards and Samuel Daniel as &quot;volunteer Laureates&quot;.

John Skelton studied at the University of Oxford in the early 1480s and was advanced to the degree of &quot;poet laureate&quot; in 1488, when he joined the court of King Henry VII to tutor the future Henry VIII. The title of &quot;laureate&quot; was also conferred on him by the University of Louvain in 1492 and by the University of Cambridge in 1492–3. He soon became famous for his rhetoric, satire and translations and was held in high esteem by the printer William Caxton, who wrote, in the preface to (Modern English: &quot;The Book of the Aeneid, compiled by Virgil&quot;) (1490):
But I pray mayster John Skelton, late created poete laureate in the unyversite of Oxenforde, to oversee and correct this sayd booke.

The academic use of the term laureate became associated again with royalty when King James I created a pension for Ben Jonson in 1617, although there is no formal record extant. He was succeeded by William Davenant.

The royal office Poet Laureate was officially conferred by letters patent on John Dryden in 1668, after Davenant&#x27;s death, and the post became a regular institution. There are other, non-official, laureate titles, such as the commercially sponsored &quot;Children&#x27;s Laureate&quot; for an &quot;eminent writer or illustrator of children&#x27;s books to celebrate outstanding achievement in their field&quot;, and the Poetry Foundation&#x27;s Young People&#x27;s Poet Laureate.

<doc id="53012" wikidata="Q4256407" url="?curid=53012" title="Killing of Chandra Levy">
<text>Chandra Ann Levy (April 14, 1977 – May 1, 2001) was an American intern at the Federal Bureau of Prisons in Washington, D.C., who disappeared in May 2001. She was presumed murdered after her skeletal remains were found in Rock Creek Park in May 2002. The case attracted attention from the American news media for several years.

Due to a miscommunication, the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia (MPD) failed to follow its own search parameters in Rock Creek Park, leaving Levy&#x27;s body to decompose for a year. Further, the MPD had been informed, but soon dismissed the information that Ingmar Guandique, already arrested for attacking women in Rock Creek Park, had confessed to attacking Levy. The MPD instead put much of its focus on the revelation that Levy had been having an extramarital affair with Congressman Gary Condit, a Democrat then serving his fifth term representing California&#x27;s 18th congressional district and a senior member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Condit was never named as a suspect by police; he was eventually cleared of any involvement. Due to the cloud of suspicion raised by the intense media focus on the missing intern and the later revelation of the affair, Condit lost his bid for re-election in 2002.

Following a series of investigative reports by &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in 2008, the MPD followed up and finally obtained a warrant, on March 3, 2009, to arrest Ingmar Guandique, identified and dismissed by the MPD eight years earlier. He had been convicted of assaulting two other women in Rock Creek Park around the time of Levy&#x27;s disappearance and was still in prison on those convictions when the arrest warrant on Levy&#x27;s death was issued. Prosecutors alleged that Guandique had attacked and tied up Levy in a remote area of the park and left her to die of dehydration or exposure. In November 2010, Guandique was convicted of murdering Levy; he was sentenced in February 2011 to 60 years in prison. In June 2015, Guandique was granted a new trial. On July 28, 2016, prosecutors announced that they would not proceed with the case against Guandique and would instead seek to have him deported. In March 2017, Guandique lost his bid to remain in the United States and was deported to his native El Salvador on May 5, 2017. Levy&#x27;s murder remains unsolved.

==Life and background==

Levy was born in Cleveland, Ohio, to Robert and Susan Levy; the family moved to Modesto, California, where she attended Grace M. Davis High School. At the time of her disappearance, her parents were members of Congregation Beth Shalom, a Conservative Jewish synagogue. She attended San Francisco State University, where she earned a degree in journalism. After interning for the California Bureau of Secondary Education and working in the office of Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, she began attending the University of Southern California to earn a master&#x27;s degree in public administration.

As part of her final semester of study, Levy moved to Washington, D.C., to become a paid intern with the Federal Bureau of Prisons. In October 2000 she began her internship at the bureau&#x27;s headquarters, where she was assigned to the public affairs division. Her supervisor, bureau spokesperson Dan Dunne, was impressed with Levy&#x27;s work, especially her handling of media inquiries regarding the upcoming execution of Timothy McVeigh, convicted of bombing the Oklahoma City Federal Building. Levy&#x27;s internship was abruptly terminated in April 2001 because her academic eligibility was found to have expired in December 2000. She had already completed her master&#x27;s degree requirements and was scheduled to return to California in May 2001 for graduation.

==Disappearance and search==
Levy was last seen on May 1, 2001. The Metropolitan Police Department was first alerted on May 6, when Levy&#x27;s parents called from Modesto to report that they had not heard from their daughter in five days. Police called hospitals and visited Levy&#x27;s apartment in Dupont Circle that day, finding no indication of foul play. On May 7, Levy&#x27;s father told the police that his daughter had been having an affair with a U.S. congressman, and the next day stated that he believed the congressman to be U.S. Representative Gary Condit. Levy&#x27;s aunt also called the police and told them that Chandra had confided in her about the affair. Police obtained a warrant on May 10 to conduct a formal search of Levy&#x27;s apartment. Investigators found her credit cards, identification and mobile phone left behind in her purse, along with partially packed suitcases. The answering machine was full, with messages left by her relatives and two from Condit. A police sergeant tried to examine Levy&#x27;s laptop computer and inadvertently corrupted the internet search data, as he was not a trained technician.

Computer experts took a month to reconstruct the data to determine that the laptop was used on the morning of May 1 to search for websites related to Amtrak, Baskin-Robbins, Condit, Southwest Airlines, and a weather report from &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. Her final search at 12:59 p.m. was for Alsace-Lorraine, a region in France. A particular search at 11:33 a.m. was for information about Rock Creek Park in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; &quot;Entertainment Guide&quot;, then at 11:34 she clicked a link to bring up a map of the park. Detectives later theorized that she might have met someone at the Pierce-Klingle Mansion which houses the park headquarters. On July 25, 2001, three D.C. police sergeants and 28 police cadets searched along Glover Road in the park but failed to find evidence related to Levy. Later, a second attempt found nothing.

Levy&#x27;s parents and friends held numerous vigils and press conferences in an attempt to &quot;bring Chandra home&quot;.

==Relationship with Condit==

Controversy surrounding Levy&#x27;s disappearance drew the attention of the American news media. Condit, a married man who represented the congressional district in which the Levy family resided, at first denied that he had had an affair with her. Although police stated that Condit was not a suspect, Levy&#x27;s family said they felt Condit was being evasive and possibly hiding information about the matter.

Unidentified police sources alleged that Condit had admitted to an affair with Levy during an interview with law enforcement officers on July 7, 2001. Condit described her to police as a vegetarian who avoided drinking and smoking. He thought that Levy was going to return to Washington, D.C. after her graduation and was surprised to find out that the lease on her apartment had ended. Investigators searched Condit&#x27;s apartment on July 10. They questioned flight attendant Anne Marie Smith, who claimed that Condit told her she did not need to speak to the Federal Bureau of Investigation about his personal life. Federal officials began investigating Condit for possible obstruction of justice, as Smith was also involved in an affair with him. (She was not acquainted with Levy.) Upset by leaks to the media, Condit refused to submit to a polygraph test by the D.C. police; his attorney asserted that Condit passed a test administered by a privately hired examiner on July 13. He avoided answering direct questions during a televised interview on August 23, with news anchor Connie Chung on the ABC News program &quot;Primetime Thursday&quot;. Intensive coverage continued until news of the September 11 attacks superseded the media&#x27;s coverage of the Levy case.

In a nationwide Fox News/Opinion Dynamics poll of 900 registered voters conducted in July 2001, 44 percent of American respondents thought that Condit was involved in Levy&#x27;s disappearance and 27 percent felt that he should resign. Fifty-one percent of the respondents believed that he was acting as if he were guilty; 13 percent felt that he should run again for office. A poll sample taken from Condit&#x27;s congressional district held a more favorable view of Condit. On March 5, 2002, Condit lost the Democratic primary election for his Congressional seat to his former aide, then-Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza, with the Levy controversy being cited as a contributing factor. He was subpoenaed to appear on April 1, 2002, before a District of Columbia grand jury investigating the disappearance. The date was kept a carefully guarded secret to avoid further leaks. Condit left Congress at the end of his term on January 3, 2003, after failing to win his re-election bid.

==Discovery of her remains==

On May 22, 2002, around 9:30 am, skeletal remains which matched Levy&#x27;s dental records were discovered by a man who was walking his dog and looking for turtles in Rock Creek Park, near Broad Branch Creek in Washington, D.C. Detectives found bones and personal items scattered, but not buried, in a forested area along a steep incline. A sports bra, sweat shirt, leggings and tennis shoes were among the evidence that was recovered. Although police had previously searched over half the main section of the park, the wooded slope where Levy&#x27;s remains were eventually found had not been searched. Police commanders ordered the search perimeters to be within of each road but due to a miscommunication, the officers only searched within 100 yards of every road. The remains were found about four miles (6 km) from Levy&#x27;s apartment.

After a preliminary autopsy was performed, District of Columbia police announced that there was sufficient evidence to open a homicide investigation. On May 28, D.C. medical examiner Jonathan L. Arden officially declared Levy&#x27;s death a homicide, but said, &quot;There&#x27;s less to work with here than I would like. It&#x27;s possible we will never know specifically how she died.&quot; Arden found damage to her hyoid bone, suggesting that she was possibly strangled, but he did not deem it to be conclusive evidence of such a cause of death. On June 6, after the police completed their search, private investigators hired by the Levys found her shin bone with some twisted wire about from the other remains. Police Chief Charles H. Ramsey said, &quot;It is unacceptable that these items were not located.&quot;

==Memorial services==
On May 28, 2002, the Levy family organized a memorial service at the Modesto Centre Plaza that drew over 1,200 people, some from as far as Los Angeles. Speakers at the 90-minute ceremony included Levy&#x27;s brother, grandmother, great-aunt and friends. In a eulogy delivered in Hebrew and English by Rabbi Paul Gordon, Levy was described as &quot;a good person taken from us much too soon&quot;. About a year later, on May 27, 2003, Levy&#x27;s remains were buried in Lakewood Memorial Park Cemetery at Hughson, California, near her home town of Modesto. Attended by about 40 of Levy&#x27;s friends and family members, the private ceremony concluded with the release of 12 white doves.

==Identification of the prime suspect==

In September 2001, Washington, D.C. police and federal prosecutors were contacted by the lawyer of an informant, held in D.C. Jail, who claimed to have knowledge of Levy&#x27;s killer. The informant, whose identity was protected for his safety, said that Ingmar Guandique, a 20-year-old undocumented immigrant from El Salvador who was also being held in the jail, told him that Condit paid him $25,000 to kill Levy.

Investigators ruled out the story about Condit, because Guandique had already admitted to assaulting two other women in the same park where Levy&#x27;s remains were found. Guandique failed to show up for work on the day of Levy&#x27;s disappearance. His former landlady recalled that his face appeared scratched and bruised at around that time. The investigators on the Levy case did not interview the other Rock Creek Park victims. Police chief Ramsey avoided calling Guandique a suspect and described him as a &quot;person of interest&quot;, telling reporters not to make &quot;too big a deal&quot; about him. Assistant chief Terrance W. Gainer said that if Guandique had been considered a suspect, D.C. police would have been after him &quot;like flies on honey&quot;.

Guandique denied attacking Levy. On November 28, the FBI had the informant take a polygraph test, which he failed. A polygraph test on Guandique, administered on February 4, 2002, returned inconclusive results that were officially ruled &quot;not deceptive&quot;. Because neither the informant nor Guandique was fluent in English, D.C. chief detective Jack Barrett said that he would have preferred polygraph tests to have been administered by bilingual examiners, who were unavailable at the time. When Judge Noel Anketell Kramer was asked about Guandique&#x27;s potential connection to the Levy homicide, she responded, &quot;This is such a satellite issue. To me it doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with this case.&quot; Kramer sentenced Guandique to 10 years in prison for his attacks on two other women at Rock Creek Park. Guandique was sent to the U.S. Penitentiary, Big Sandy near Inez, Kentucky, and was later transferred to the U.S. Penitentiary at Victorville, California.
The Levy homicide remained listed as a &quot;cold case&quot; until 2006, when Cathy L. Lanier succeeded Ramsey as D.C. police chief. Lanier replaced the lead detective on the case with three veteran investigators who had more homicide experience. In 2007, the editors of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; assigned a new team of reporters to take a year to re-examine the Levy case. The resulting series of articles, published during the summer of 2008, focused on the past failure of the police to fully investigate Guandique&#x27;s connection to the attacks in Rock Creek Park. In September 2008, investigators searched Guandique&#x27;s federal prison cell in California and found a photo of Levy that he had saved from a magazine. Police interviewed acquaintances of Guandique and witnesses of the other Rock Creek Park incidents.

On March 3, 2009, the Superior Court of the District of Columbia issued an arrest warrant for Guandique. He was returned to the custody of the District of Columbia Department of Corrections on April 20 via the Federal Transfer Center in Oklahoma City. Two days later, Guandique was charged in D.C. with Levy&#x27;s murder. He was indicted by a grand jury on six counts: kidnapping, first-degree murder committed during a kidnapping, attempted first-degree sexual abuse, first-degree murder committed during a sexual offense, attempted robbery, and first-degree murder committed during a robbery. Guandique pleaded not guilty at his arraignment, where a trial date was initially set for January 27, 2010. His lawyers argued that Guandique&#x27;s federal prison cell was outside the jurisdiction of a court-ordered search. After errors in processing contaminated some of the gathered evidence with DNA from employees of the prosecution, the start date of the trial at the H. Carl Moultrie Courthouse was moved to October 4, 2010.

==Trial of Guandique==

On October 18, 2010, jury selection commenced in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia before Judge Gerald I. Fisher. Assistant U.S. Attorney Fernando Campoamor-Sanchez presented the names of potential witnesses for the trial, including FBI agent Brad Garrett and the two women whom Guandique was convicted of assaulting. At the start of the trial, the prosecution&#x27;s case was expected to take around four weeks and the defense was expected to take one day. On October 25 and 26, Halle Shilling and Christy Wiegand testified about being attacked by Guandique while independently jogging in Rock Creek Park. Wiegand recounted that Guandique grabbed her from behind, dragged her down a ravine and held a knife against her face.

On October 26, 2010, Levy&#x27;s then-64-year-old father, Robert, took the stand and refuted statements about his past suspicions of Condit. Robert Levy testified that he told authorities during the early years of the investigation that his daughter Chandra would have been too cautious to jog in the woods alone, but said that he no longer believed this to be true. He said that he also told police that his daughter and Condit had a five-year plan between them to get married. In retrospect, Robert Levy admitted: &quot;I just said whatever came to mind just to point to him as the villain.&quot; Levy added that he had been convinced that Condit was &quot;guilty until we learned about this character here,&quot; referring to Guandique. On November 1, Condit testified at the trial and was asked on at least three occasions if he and Chandra Levy had been involved in a sexual relationship. He replied, &quot;I am not going to respond to that question out of privacy for myself and Chandra.&quot; FBI biologist Alan Giusti testified that semen found on underwear from Levy&#x27;s apartment contained sperm matching Condit&#x27;s DNA profile.
Prosecution witness Armando Morales, who shared a cell with Guandique at the U.S. Penitentiary in Kentucky, testified that Guandique was concerned about being transferred between prisons in 2006 because of inmate violence against suspected rapists. Morales stated that Guandique, a fellow member of the Mara Salvatrucha gang, confided to him that he had killed Levy while trying to rob her, but said that he did not rape her. The prosecution rested their case on November 10, while dropping two out of the six charges against Guandique: sexual assault and murder associated with that assault. On November 15, the defense rested its case without calling Guandique to the stand. Other prison witnesses called by the defense refuted Morales&#x27; testimony. Jose Manuel Alaniz said that Guandique made no mention of rape or murder while sharing a cell with both Alaniz and Morales at the penitentiary in Kentucky. Alaniz admitted under cross-examination that he &quot;didn&#x27;t want to be too nosy&quot; and was often asleep at the prison while recovering from a gunshot wound. The prosecution dropped two more charges because the statute of limitations had passed: kidnapping and attempted robbery. During closing arguments for the remaining charges of first-degree murder committed during a kidnapping and during a robbery, prosecutor Amanda Haines contended that Guandique bound and gagged Levy after attacking her, leaving her to die of dehydration or exposure in the park. Defense attorney Santha Sonenberg countered with the lack of any DNA evidence connecting Guandique to the crime scene. Calling the prosecution&#x27;s case &quot;fiction&quot;, Sonenberg suggested that Levy had been murdered elsewhere, with her dead body being dumped in the park.

The jury began deliberations on November 17, 2010. Scheduled proceedings of the case met delays because of increased security at the courthouse. After two days of deliberations, all but one juror had voted to convict Guandique. On the third day, the jury asked Judge Gerald Fisher to clarify the definition of assault. Fisher responded that any physical injury could legally be considered an assault, regardless of how small. On November 22, 2010, the jury found Guandique guilty of both remaining counts of first-degree murder. After the trial, a juror said the testimony of Morales was decisive in reaching the verdict. The conviction was called a &quot;miracle&quot; for having been reached with only circumstantial evidence. Gladys Weatherspoon, who had previously represented Guandique in the 2001 assault cases, stated that she was troubled by the jury&#x27;s verdict: &quot;I just think they were going to convict anyway... They felt bad for that woman, the mom. She&#x27;s sitting in there every day.&quot; At a post-trial press conference, Susan Levy said, &quot;There&#x27;s always going to be a feeling of sadness. I can surely tell you, it ain&#x27;t closure.&quot; Since the conclusion of the trial, Susan Levy has acted to keep photographic evidence of her daughter&#x27;s remains sealed from the news media.

===Sentencing and appeals===
On February 1, 2011, Guandique&#x27;s attorneys requested a new trial on the grounds that the verdict had been improperly attained. The 17-page filing claimed that the prosecutors had appealed to the emotions of the jury, using &quot;references to facts not in evidence&quot;. The motion also alleged that one juror, who did not take notes, had breached the judge&#x27;s instructions not to be &quot;influenced by another juror&#x27;s notes&quot;. The prosecution opposed a retrial, arguing that the issue regarding the notes was no more than a technicality that did not have a significant effect on the verdict.

Guandique faced a minimum penalty of 30 years to a maximum of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. In seeking the maximum possible sentence, the prosecutors stated that Guandique &quot;is unable to control himself and thus, will always remain a danger to women&quot;. A memo submitted by the prosecution in February 2011 cited Guandique&#x27;s harassment of female staff in prison, including soliciting a nurse and masturbating in front of guards. Assistant U.S. Attorney Fernando Campoamor-Sanchez disclosed that he had traveled to El Salvador with a detective to investigate allegations that Guandique had fled his native country because of suspected attacks against local women dating back to 1999. During the sentencing hearing on February 11, Guandique said to Levy&#x27;s family, &quot;I am sorry for what happened to your daughter&quot;, and insisted on his innocence. Before Judge Gerald Fisher reminded Susan Levy to address the court instead of the defendant, Levy said to him, &quot;Did you really take her life? Look me in my eyes and tell me.&quot; Fisher denied Guandique&#x27;s motion for retrial and handed down a sentence of 60 years in prison, stating that Guandique &quot;will be a danger for some time. He&#x27;s a sexual predator.&quot;

Guandique repeated his innocence during his sentencing. He has maintained his innocence in the years since the trial.

On February 25, 2011, public defender James Klein filed an appeal of Guandique&#x27;s conviction with the District of Columbia Court of Appeals. In December 2012 and January 2013, a set of secret hearings were made known to the public, but the subject of the meetings was sealed by the judge. After a third hearing in February, the judge in the case unsealed transcripts from the previous hearings which revealed that Klein was seeking a new trial based on new evidence in the case. A fourth hearing was scheduled for April 2013.

=== Dropped charges ===
In May 2015, prosecutors dropped their opposition to a new trial. This resulted from defense claims that the prosecution&#x27;s star witness, Armando Morales, had perjured himself on the stand. The defense contended that prosecutors failed to disclose that Morales was a jailhouse informant with a reputation for being untrustworthy. Morales had denied ever being an informant. The defense also argued that Morales made up Guandique&#x27;s confession in order to boost his stock with prosecutors. On June 3, the defense said that a new witness, a neighbor, called 911 at 4:37 a.m. on the last day Levy was alive in order to report hearing a &#x27;blood-curdling scream&#x27;, possibly coming from Levy&#x27;s apartment. The following day, Judge Gerald Fisher granted a motion for the new trial. Judge Robert E. Morin set the retrial of Guandique for March 1, 2016, but at that time, it was moved to October 11.

In November 2015, prosecutors told a D.C. Superior Court judge that their office had failed to turn over documents to the defense before the defendant&#x27;s first trial. In December 2015, defense attorneys argued in new court filings that the charges should be dismissed because of those errors.

Specifically, the defense argued that they had only received two of three pages of a memo detailing prosecutors&#x27; contacts with Morales. At trial he had testified that he had never cooperated with law enforcement prior to the Levy case. The missing first page noted that he had previously approached law enforcement to discuss gang activity, including the actions of gangs to which he belonged. The defense argued this information had been purposely withheld from them, as it might suggest that Morales had shaded his testimony to gain favor with prosecutors.

On July 28, 2016, prosecutors announced that they would not proceed with the case against Guandique and would, instead, seek to have him deported. According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, prosecutors lost confidence in the case after learning that Morales, who now lives in Maryland, was secretly recorded admitting lying on the witness stand during the 2010 trial. Babs Proller, the woman who made the recording, turned it over to the police. The U.S. Attorney&#x27;s Office said only that based on new information that had come to light during the previous week, there was no longer enough evidence to go forward with the retrial. In March 2017 Guandique lost his bid to remain in the United States and was deported to his native El Salvador in May.

=== Disciplinary proceedings against prosecutors ===
Defense lawyers for Guandique believed that Campoamor-Sánchez and Haines had deliberately failed to turn over the first page of the Morales memo. They filed a complaint to that effect with the Justice Department&#x27;s Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR). After investigating for two years, OPR found no ethical or legal violations.

Campoamor-Sánchez left the Justice Department to work at the Securities and Exchange Commission, and Haines retired. In 2020 the District of Columbia Bar&#x27;s Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) announced it would investigate the allegations; it brought charges the following May.

At the hearing both attorneys testified in their behalf. Haines believed that the full memo had been turned over to the defense and they had lost the first page. She did not think there would have been any reason for prosecutors to withhold it as it did not seriously damage their case; but she sometimes delayed turning over more specific information on witnesses to the defense since at some trials that had led to those witnesses getting killed. Both she and Campoamor-Sánchez testified that they had clashed over what to turn over to the defense and when, since at the time there were no clear rules in the Justice Department about it, leading to greater clashes between the two about who would question Morales at trial and handle the case&#x27;s closing argument—Campoamor-Sánchez had originally been scheduled to do both, but Haines reassigned those tasks to herself, leaving him feeling marginalized.

Three months later ODC announced its preliminary conclusion that the two had violated bar rules requiring that prosecutors disclose potentially exculpatory evidence to defense lawyers, and recommended both be suspended from practicing law for six months. Both contested that punishment, with Haines&#x27;s attorney calling it &quot;unhinged—from both reality and from any precedent in law or logic&quot;. She and Campoamor-Sánchez have denied any wrongdoing.

== Media coverage ==
The disappearance of Chandra Levy became a national topic of the news media in the summer of 2001, with 63% of Americans closely following the case. The media swamped Levy&#x27;s parents from the moment they decided to go to Washington, D.C., in search of their daughter. According to Condit, about a hundred reporters were camped out in front of his apartment during the morning of September 11, 2001, but they all left after news spread about that day&#x27;s terrorist attacks in New York and Washington. Media critics and cable news executives later cited the Levy case, as well as the concurrent sensationalist coverage of a string of shark attacks, as a reflection of the manner of news coverage in the United States before the September 11 attacks had taken priority.

In 2002, D.C. newspaper &quot;Roll Call&quot; first reported Ingmar Guandique&#x27;s possible connection to the case, with little effect on the news media&#x27;s focus on Condit. Conservative commentator Michelle Malkin noted the lack of headlines that an illegal immigrant had been questioned in the Levy case. She said that in her review of 115 news items from the LexisNexis database, not a single mention of Guandique referred to his status as a &quot;criminal illegal alien&quot;. She called the &quot;glaring omission&quot; of his status &quot;a newsworthy act of negligence&quot;. She wrote that only the very conservative &quot;Human Events&quot; reported that the Immigration and Naturalization Service had approved his working legally while he was applying for temporary protected status. That application was ultimately denied, but not before he had assaulted two other women at Rock Creek Park.

In 2005, investigative journalist Dominick Dunne said on &quot;Larry King Live&quot; that he believed that Gary Condit had more information about the Levy case than he had been disclosing. Condit filed two lawsuits against Dunne, forcing him into an undisclosed financial settlement on one of them. In 2008, U.S. District Judge Peter Leisure dismissed the other suit that alleged slander, because &quot;The context in which Dunne&#x27;s statements were made demonstrates that they were part of a discussion about &quot;speculation&quot; in the media and inaccurate media coverage&quot;.

During the summer of 2008, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; ran a 13-part series billed, in part, as &quot;a tale of the tabloid and mainstream press pack journalism that helped derail the investigation&quot;. The two investigative reporters who were behind the &quot;Post&quot; series, Scott Higham and Sari Horwitz, wrote a book which detailed their investigation. The book, &quot;Finding Chandra&quot;, was published in May 2010. Commentators, including &quot;The Washington Post&quot; Metro reporter Robert Pierre, wrote that emphasis on a glamorous white murder victim, when &quot;about 200 people are killed in this city every year, most of them black and male&quot;, was &quot;absolutely absurd and dare I say, racist, at its core&quot;.

The media was criticized for its &quot;rush to judgment&quot; in suggesting, sometimes blatantly, that Condit was guilty of the murder, especially in the early days of the investigation. Some of the reporters who were camped out in front of Condit&#x27;s Washington apartment house were quoted as saying that they would remain there &quot;until he resigns&quot;. When Ingmar Guandique was convicted of murdering Levy in November 2010, Condit&#x27;s lawyer Bert Fields remarked, &quot;It&#x27;s a complete vindication but that comes a little late. Who gives him his career back?&quot;

On the 17th anniversary of the homicide, Levy&#x27;s mother continued to push for further investigation into her daughter&#x27;s death.

An episode of the podcast You&#x27;re Wrong About released on May 25, 2020, reviewed the events surrounding her disappearance and the search for her.

== Impact ==
Levy&#x27;s death has had a lasting impact, due in part to the efforts of her family and friends. Levy&#x27;s disappearance came after a number of other high-profile cases that led to the creation of resources for missing young adults. For example, Levy&#x27;s parents quickly requested help from the Carole Sund/Carrington Memorial Reward Foundation, a nonprofit group that was established in Modesto after three female tourists disappeared from a 1999 trip to Yosemite National Park and were later found slain. That foundation, which offered the Levys staff support and contributed towards a cash reward for information about Chandra&#x27;s disappearance, was merged into the Laci and Conner Search and Rescue Fund in 2009; Susan Levy had previously participated in the efforts to find Laci Peterson, another missing woman from Modesto.

In 1997, when Kristen Modafferi mysteriously disappeared from the San Francisco Bay Area just three weeks after her 18th birthday, her parents turned to their congresswoman for help, because they were ineligible to receive help from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. As a result, Congress enacted &quot;Kristen&#x27;s Law&quot; in October 2000, which established the National Center for Missing Adults (NCMA) within the U.S. Department of Justice in order to coordinate such missing persons cases. By the time Levy disappeared, institutions were in place in order to provide her family with support and assist in a nationwide search to locate her. Although the Levy family quickly moved to mobilize all such available resources, including offering a cash reward for information, hiring its own investigators, and seeking media attention, those efforts to locate Chandra Levy or find her killer were overshadowed by the speculation which surrounded her possible relationship with Condit. Susan Levy later joined forces with Donna Raley, the mother of another young woman who disappeared from Modesto in 1999, to form &quot;Wings of Protection&quot;, a support group for people with missing loved ones. The Mary Ann Liebert company, the publisher of the &quot;Journal of Women&#x27;s Health and Gender-Based Medicine&quot;, presented its annual Criterion Award to Susan Levy for her work with &quot;Wings of Protection&quot; in May 2002.

&quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine stated that the media may have become more skeptical of &quot;herd mentality&quot; and open to alternative suspects after the Levy case. The D.C. police claimed that it would have discovered Levy&#x27;s body earlier if not for a miscommunication regarding the scope of the search. Commanders had ordered that a search be conducted within of each road and trail in Rock Creek Park, but searches were only made within 100 yards of each road, causing the body to remain undiscovered for a longer period of time.

Both the chief of detectives, Jack Barrett, and the chief of police, Charles H. Ramsey, have since left the force in Washington, D.C. Ramsey became head of the Philadelphia Police Department; Barrett, who became an analyst for an intelligence support firm in Arlington County, Virginia, stated in hindsight that the media had imposed &quot;enormous amounts of pressure&quot; on the Washington, D.C. police. Morales, who is serving time for conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine and crack cocaine, was scheduled to be released on August 5, 2016. Condit retired from politics and moved to Phoenix, Arizona with his wife to manage real estate and open two Baskin-Robbins franchises, which have since closed.

<text>This is a list of monarchs of Spain, a dominion started with the dynastic union of the Catholic Monarchs of Spain Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile.

The regnal numbers follow those of the rulers of Asturias, León, and Castile. Thus, Alfonso XII is numbered in succession to Alfonso XI of Castile.

==Forerunners==
The following seven lineages were eventually united by the marriage of Ferdinand and Isabella.
*Kings of the Visigoths
*Kings of Asturias
*Kings of Navarre 
*Kings of León
*Kings of Galicia
*Kings of Aragon
*Kings of Castile

Although Aragon and Castile continued to be separate, they were ruled together until the Nueva Planta decrees.

==House of Trastámara (1479–1516)==
Under Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon, their royal dynasties were united into a single line. Historiography of Spain generally treats this as the formation of the Kingdom of Spain, but officially speaking, the two kingdoms continued with their own separate institutions for more than two centuries. It was not until the Nueva Planta decrees of 1707–1716 that the two lands were formally merged into a single state.

==House of Habsburg (1516–1700)==

Following the deaths of Isabella (1504) and Ferdinand (1516), their daughter Joanna inherited the Spanish kingdoms. However, she was kept prisoner at Tordesillas due to an alleged mental disorder. As Joanna&#x27;s son, Charles I (the future Holy Roman Emperor Charles V), did not want to be merely a regent, he proclaimed himself king of Castile and Aragon jointly with his mother. Subsequently, Castilian and Aragonese &quot;Cortes&quot; recognized him as co-monarch along with his mother. Upon her death, he became sole King of Castile and Aragon, and the thrones were left permanently united to Philip II of Spain and successors. Traditional numbering of monarchs follows the Castillian crown; i.e. after King Ferdinand (II of Aragon and V of Castile &quot;jure uxoris&quot; as husband of Queen of Castille Isabella I), the next Ferdinand was numbered VI. Likewise, Alfonso XII takes his number following that of Alfonso XI of Castile rather than that of Alfonso V of Aragon, the prior Spanish monarch with that name.

In the year 1700, Charles II died. His will named the 16-year-old Philip, Duke of Anjou, the grandson of Charles&#x27;s sister Maria Theresa of Spain, as his successor to the whole Spanish Empire. Upon any possible refusal of the undivided Spanish possessions, the Crown of Spain would be offered next to Philip&#x27;s younger brother Charles, Duke of Berry, or, next, to Archduke Charles of Austria.

Both claimants, both Charles of Austria and Philip, had a legal right to the Spanish throne because Philip&#x27;s grandfather, King Louis XIV of France and Charles&#x27;s father, Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor, were sons of Charles II&#x27;s aunts, Anne and Maria Anna. Philip claimed primogeniture because Anne was older than Maria Anna. However, Philip IV had stipulated in his will the succession should pass to the Austrian Habsburg line, and the Austrian branch also claimed that Maria Theresa, Philip&#x27;s grandmother, had renounced the Spanish throne for herself and her descendants as part of her marriage contract. This was countered by the French claim that it was on the basis of a dowry that had never been paid.

After a long council meeting where the Dauphin spoke up in favour of his son&#x27;s rights, it was agreed that Philip would ascend the throne. Following this, the War of the Spanish Succession broke out and Archduke Charles was also proclaimed king of Spain, as Charles III, in opposition to Philip V. He was proclaimed in Vienna, and also in Madrid in the years 1706 and 1710. Charles renounced his claims to the Spanish throne in the Treaty of Rastatt of 1714, but was allowed the continued use of the styles of a Spanish monarch for his lifetime. Philip ascended the Spanish throne but had to renounce his claim to the throne of France for himself and his descendants.

===Disputed claimant of the House of Habsburg===
==House of Bourbon (1700–1808)==

==House of Bonaparte (1808–1813)==

The only monarch from this dynasty was Joseph I, imposed by his brother Napoleon I of France after Charles IV and Ferdinand VII had abdicated. The title used by Joseph I was &quot;King of the Spains and the Indias, by the Grace of God and the Constitution of the State&quot;. He was also later given all of the titles of the previous kings. A government in opposition to the French was formed in Cádiz on 25 September 1808, which continued to recognize the imprisoned Ferdinand VII as king. This government was diplomatically recognized as the legitimate Spanish government by Britain and other countries at war with France.
==House of Bourbon (1813–1868)==

Charles IV&#x27;s eldest son was restored to the throne. Again, the title used was &quot;king of Castile, Leon, Aragon,… by the Grace of God&quot;.
==House of Savoy (1870–1873)==

After the Spanish Revolution of 1868 deposed Isabella II, while a new monarch was sought, a provisional government and a regency headed by Francisco Serrano y Domínguez from 8 October 1868 until 2 January 1871 was established. Amadeo was elected as king and the new title used was &quot;King of Spain, by the Grace of God and will of the nation&quot;.
==Spanish Republic (1873–1874)==
==House of Bourbon (1874–1931)==

Isabella II&#x27;s eldest son was restored to the throne as she had abdicated in his favour in 1870. Unlike previous Spanish rulers, the restored Bourbons led as constitutional monarchs.
==Spanish Republic (1931–1939)==
==Dictatorship of Francisco Franco (1939–1975)==
On 1 October 1936, General Francisco Franco was proclaimed &quot;Leader of Spain&quot; (Spanish: &quot;Caudillo de España&quot;) in the parts of Spain controlled by the Nationalists (&quot;nacionales&quot;) after the Spanish Civil War broke out. At the end of the war, on 1 April 1939, Franco took control of the whole of Spain, ending the Second Republic. The 36-year period that followed would be officially called the Estado Español, or the Spanish State. Although Franco proclaimed the restoration of the monarchy in 1947, he did not allow the pretender, Juan, Count of Barcelona, to take the throne. Instead, 22 years later, in 1969, he declared as his successor Juan Carlos, Prince of Spain and son of the Count of Barcelona. This succession took place upon Franco&#x27;s death in 1975, when Juan Carlos became King of Spain. A three-year transition to democracy followed during which the apparatus of the Franco government was gently dismantled and preparations for a new system, from 1978, were laid.

==House of Bourbon (1975–present)==

Alfonso XIII&#x27;s claim descended (due to his two eldest sons&#x27; renunciations) to his third son, Juan of Bourbon, Count of Barcelona, who was passed over in favour of his eldest son, whose title is King of Spain. The Count of Barcelona formally renounced his claims in favour of his son in 1977, two years after Franco&#x27;s death and Juan Carlos&#x27;s accession.

Juan Carlos abdicated in favor of his son Felipe VI, who became king on 19 June 2014, with Felipe&#x27;s older daughter, Leonor, next in succession.

<text>Sturgeon&#x27;s law (or Sturgeon&#x27;s revelation) is an adage stating &quot;ninety percent of everything is crap&quot;. It was coined by Theodore Sturgeon, an American science fiction author and critic, and was inspired by his observation that, while science fiction was often derided for its low quality by critics, most work in other fields was low-quality too, and so science fiction was no different.

== Development ==

Sturgeon deemed Sturgeon&#x27;s law to mean &quot;nothing is always absolutely so&quot;. This adage previously appeared in his story &quot;The Claustrophile&quot; in a 1956 issue of &quot;Galaxy&quot;.

The second adage, variously rendered as &quot;ninety percent of everything is crud&quot; or &quot;ninety percent of everything is crap&quot;, was published as &quot;Sturgeon&#x27;s Revelation&quot; in his book review column for &quot;Venture&quot; in 1957. However, almost all modern uses of the term Sturgeon&#x27;s law refer to the second, including the definition listed in the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;.

According to science fiction author William Tenn, Sturgeon first expressed his law circa 1951, at a talk at New York University attended by Tenn. The statement was subsequently included in a talk Sturgeon gave at a 1953 Labor Day weekend session of the World Science Fiction Convention in Philadelphia.

The first written reference to the adage is in the September 1957 issue of &quot;Venture&quot;:

The adage appears again in the March 1958 issue of &quot;Venture&quot;, where Sturgeon wrote:
== Precedents and proponents ==
In the 1870 novel, &quot;Lothair&quot;, by Benjamin Disraeli, it is asserted that: Nine-tenths of existing books are nonsense, and the clever books are the refutation of that nonsense. A similar adage appears in Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;The Light That Failed&quot;, published in 1890. 

A 1946 essay &quot;Confessions of a Book Reviewer&quot; by George Orwell asserts about books:

In 2009, a paper published in &quot;The Lancet&quot; estimated that over 85% of health and medical research is wasted.

In 2013, philosopher Daniel Dennett championed Sturgeon&#x27;s law as one of his seven tools for critical thinking.

<doc id="53016" wikidata="Q28389" url="?curid=53016" title="Screenwriter">
<text>A screenwriter (also called scriptwriter, scribe, or scenarist) is someone who practices the craft of writing for visual mass media, known as screenwriting. These can include short films, feature-length films, television programs, television commercials, video games, and the growing area of online web series.

==Terminology==

In the silent era, screenwriters were denoted by terms such as photoplaywright, photoplay writer, photoplay dramatist, and screen playwright. Screenwriting historian Steven Maras notes that these early writers were often understood as being the authors of the films as shown, and argues that they could not be precisely equated with present-day screenwriters because they were responsible for a technical product, a brief &quot;scenario&quot;, &quot;treatment&quot;, or &quot;synopsis&quot; that is a written synopsis of what is to be filmed.

==Profession==
Screenwriting is a contracted freelance profession, not a hired position. No education is required to be a professional screenwriter, but good storytelling abilities and imagination give aspiring screenwriters an advantage. Many screenwriters start their careers doing speculative work (&quot;work on spec&quot;), practicing their screenwriting with no guaranteed financial compensation. If one of these scripts is sold, it is called a spec script. Amateur screenwriters will often pursue this work as &quot;writers in training,&quot; leading these spec scripts to often go uncredited or come from unknown screenwriters.

Further separating professional and amateur screenwriters is that professionals are usually represented by a talent agency. These screenwriter-specific employment agencies work to handle the business side of the screenwriting job, typically taking on legal, financial, and other important representative roles for the screenwriter. These professional screenwriters rarely work for free.

There are a legion of would-be screenwriters who attempt to enter the film industry, but it often takes years of trial and error, failure, and gritty persistence to achieve success. In &quot;Writing Screenplays that Sell&quot;, Michael Hague writes, &quot;Screenplays have become, for the last half of [the twentieth] century, what the Great American Novel was for the first half. Closet writers who used to dream of the glory of getting into print now dream of seeing their story on the big or small screen.&quot;

==Film industry==
Every screenplay and teleplay begins with a thought or idea, and screenwriters use their ideas to write scripts, with the intention of selling them and having them produced. In some cases the script is based on an existing property, such as a book or person&#x27;s life story, which is adapted by the screenwriter. In most cases, a film project is initiated by a screenwriter. The initiator of the project gets the exclusive writing assignment. They are referred to as &quot;exclusive&quot; assignments or &quot;pitched&quot; assignments. Screenwriters who often pitch new projects, whether original or an adaptation, often do not have to worry about competing for assignments and are often more successful. When word is put out about a project that a film studio, production company, or producer wants done, they are referred to as &quot;open&quot; assignments. Open assignments are more competitive. If screenwriters are competing for an open assignment, more established writers usually win the assignments. A screenwriter can also be approached and personally offered a writing assignment.

==Script doctoring==
Many screenwriters also work as full- or part-time script doctors, attempting to better a script to suit the desires of a director or studio. For instance, studio management may have a complaint that the motivations of the characters are unclear or that the dialogue is weak.

Hollywood has shifted writers onto and off projects since its earliest days, and the assignment of credits is not always straightforward or complete, which poses a problem for film study. In his book &quot;Talking Pictures&quot;, Richard Corliss discussed the historian&#x27;s dilemma: &quot;A writer may be given screen credit for work he didn&#x27;t do (as with Sidney Buchman on &quot;Holiday&quot;), or be denied credit for work he did do (as with Sidney Buchman on &quot;The Awful Truth&quot;).&quot;

==Development process==
After a screenwriter finishes a project, they pair with an industry-based representative, such as a producer, director, literary agent, entertainment lawyer, or entertainment executive. The partnerships often pitch their project to investors or others in a position to further a project. Once the script is sold, the writer has only the rights that were agreed with the purchaser.

A screenwriter becomes credible by having work that is recognized, which gives the writer the opportunity to earn a higher income. As more films are produced independently (outside the studio system), many up-and-coming screenwriters are turning to pitch fests, screenplay contests, and independent development services to gain access to established and credible independent producers. Many development executives are now working independently to incubate their own pet projects.

==Production involvement==
Screenwriters are rarely involved in the production of a film. Sometimes they come on as advisors, or if they are established, as a producer. Some screenwriters also direct. Although many scripts are sold each year, many do not make it into production because the number of scripts that are purchased every year exceeds the number of professional directors that are working in the film and TV industry. When a screenwriter finishes a project and sells it to a film studio, production company, TV network, or producer, they often have to continue networking, mainly with directors or executives, and push to have their projects &quot;chosen&quot; and turned into films or TV shows. If interest in a script begins to fade, a project can go dead.

==Unions==
The International Affiliation of Writers Guilds (IAWG) is the international federation of screenwriters&#x27; and playwrights&#x27; unions, who recognize union membership across international borders. They have 14 different affiliates across various nations who collectively work to verify original authorship, fight for fair compensation, and enforce copyright.

Most professional screenwriters in the U.S. are unionized and are represented by the Writers Guild of America (WGA). Although membership in the WGA is recommended, it is not required of a screenwriter to join. The WGA is the final arbiter on awarding writing credit for projects under its jurisdiction. The WGA also looks upon and verifies film copyright materials.

Other notable screenwriters&#x27; unions include the Writers&#x27; Guild of Great Britain, representing screenwriters in the UK, and La Guilde Française des Scénaristes, representing screenwriters in France.

==Salary==
Minimum salaries for union screenwriters in the US are set by the Writers Guild of America. The median compensation for a first draft from a first time screenwriter is $100,000, while the most experienced members have a median compensation of $450,000. The most experienced WGA members have reported up to $4,000,0000 compensation for a first draft. Multi-step deals, where the writer is signed on for more than the first draft (typically including a rewrite) can earn a screenwriter more, with experienced WGA members earning up to $5,000,000 for their work.

Non-union screenwriters can also work for a salary, but will typically earn less than a unionized screenwriter. Pay can vary dramatically for a non-unionized screenwriter.

===Definitions===

*Against: A word used to describe a script&#x27;s unproduced price relative to its value if approved for production—for example, if a script is sold for $300,000, but the writer gains an extra $200,000 if it leads to production, the screenwriter&#x27;s salary is described as &quot;$300,000 against $500,000&quot;.
* Option: If a script is not purchased, it may be optioned. An option is money paid in exchange for the right (the &quot;option&quot;) to produce—and therefore to purchase outright—a screenplay, treatment, or other work within a certain period.
* Feature assignment: The writer writes the script on assignment under contract with a studio, production company, or individual.
* Pitch: The writer holds a five- to twenty-minute presentation of the film to buyers in a short meeting.
* Rewriting: The writer rewrites someone else&#x27;s script for pay. The writer pitches their &quot;take&quot;, much like they would an original pitch.
* Spec script: Short for &quot;speculative&quot; or &quot;on speculation&quot; as in; &quot;She wrote her script on spec&quot;. The writer writes the script (original or someone else&#x27;s idea) without being paid, and, subsequently, tries to sell it.

===History===
* 1900: One of the U.S.&#x27;s first screenwriters, New York journalist Roy McCardell, is hired to write ten scenarios (each about 90 seconds long) for $15 each ().
* 1949: Ben Hecht is paid $10,000 a week (about $ in ). Claims David O. Selznick paid him $3,500 a day (about $ in ).
* 1984: Shane Black sells the screenplay to &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; for $250,000.
* 1990: Kathy McWorter, who was promoted by her agent as a 21-year-old &quot;wunderkind&quot;, though in fact she was 28 years old, sells her sex comedy &quot;The Cheese Stands Alone&quot; for $1 million. This was followed by nuclear-terrorist technothriller &quot;The Ultimatum&quot; by Laurence Dworet and Robert Roy Pool, and WWII action comedy &quot;Hell Bent... and Back!&quot; by Doug Richardson and Rick Jaffa, both of which sold for a million dollars. None of these movies has been produced so far.
* 1992: Sherry Lansing is hired to run Paramount and spends $3.6 million in less than a week, $2.5 million for a two-page outline of &quot;Jade&quot; by Joe Eszterhas, and $1.1 million (about $ in 2018) for the script &quot;Milk Money&quot; by John Mattson. Both deals are records, respectively, for outlines and romantic comedy specs.
* 2005: Terry Rossio and Bill Marsilii are paid $3 million against $5 million for the script of &quot;Déjà Vu&quot;.

===Current records===

<doc id="53017" wikidata="Q381243" url="?curid=53017" title="Special effect">
<text>Special effects (often abbreviated as F/X or simply FX) are illusions or visual tricks used in the theatre, film, television, video game, amusement park and simulator industries to simulate the fictional events in a story or virtual world. It is sometimes abbreviated as SFX, but this may also refer to &quot;sound effects&quot;.

Special effects are traditionally divided into the categories of mechanical effects and optical effects. With the emergence of digital filmmaking a distinction between special effects and visual effects has grown, with the latter referring to digital post-production and optical effects, while &quot;special effects&quot; refers to mechanical effects.

Mechanical effects (also called practical or physical effects) are usually accomplished during the live-action shooting. This includes the use of mechanised props, scenery, scale models, animatronics, pyrotechnics and atmospheric effects: creating physical wind, rain, fog, snow, clouds, making a car appear to drive by itself and blowing up a building, etc. Mechanical effects are also often incorporated into set design and make-up. For example, prosthetic make-up can be used to make an actor look like a non-human creature.

Optical effects (also called photographic effects) are the techniques in which images or film frames are created photographically, either &quot;in-camera&quot; using multiple exposure, mattes or the Schüfftan process or in post-production using an optical printer. An optical effect might be used to place actors or sets against a different background.

Since the 1990s, computer-generated imagery (CGI) has come to the forefront of special effects technologies. It gives filmmakers greater control, and allows many effects to be accomplished more safely and convincingly and—as technology improves—at lower costs. As a result, many optical and mechanical effects techniques have been superseded by CGI.

==Developmental history==

===Early development===
In 1857, Oscar Rejlander created the world&#x27;s first &quot;special effects&quot; image by combining different sections of 32 negatives into a single image, making a montaged combination print. In 1895, Alfred Clark created what is commonly accepted as the first-ever motion picture special effect. While filming a reenactment of the beheading of Mary, Queen of Scots, Clark instructed an actor to step up to the block in Mary&#x27;s costume. As the executioner brought the axe above his head, Clark stopped the camera, had all of the actors freeze, and had the person playing Mary step off the set. He placed a Mary dummy in the actor&#x27;s place, restarted filming, and allowed the executioner to bring the axe down, severing the dummy&#x27;s head. Techniques like these would dominate the production of special effects for a century.

It wasn&#x27;t only the first use of trickery in cinema, it was also the first type of photographic trickery that was only possible in a motion picture, and referred to as the &quot;stop trick&quot;. Georges Méliès, an early motion picture pioneer, accidentally discovered the same &quot;stop trick.&quot; According to Méliès, his camera jammed while filming a street scene in Paris. When he screened the film, he found that the &quot;stop trick&quot; had caused a truck to turn into a hearse, pedestrians to change direction, and men to turn into women. Méliès, the stage manager at the Theatre Robert-Houdin, was inspired to develop a series of more than 500 short films between 1896 and 1914, in the process developing or inventing such techniques as multiple exposures, time-lapse photography, dissolves, and hand painted colour. Because of his ability to seemingly manipulate and transform reality with the cinematograph, the prolific Méliès is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Cinemagician.&quot; His most famous film, &quot;Le Voyage dans la lune&quot; (1902), a whimsical parody of Jules Verne&#x27;s &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot;, featured a combination of live action and animation, and also incorporated extensive miniature and matte painting work.

From 1910 to 1920, the main innovations in special effects were the improvements on the matte shot by Norman Dawn. With the original matte shot, pieces of cardboard were placed to block the exposure of the film, which would be exposed later. Dawn combined this technique with the &quot;glass shot.&quot; Rather than using cardboard to block certain areas of the film exposure, Dawn simply painted certain areas black to prevent any light from exposing the film. From the partially exposed film, a single frame is then projected onto an easel, where the matte is then drawn. By creating the matte from an image directly from the film, it became incredibly easy to paint an image with proper respect to scale and perspective (the main flaw of the glass shot). Dawn&#x27;s technique became the textbook for matte shots due to the natural images it created.

During the 1920s and 1930s, special effects techniques were improved and refined by the motion picture industry. Many techniques—such as the Schüfftan process—were modifications of illusions from the theatre (such as pepper&#x27;s ghost) and still photography (such as double exposure and matte compositing). Rear projection was a refinement of the use of painted backgrounds in the theatre, substituting moving pictures to create moving backgrounds. Lifecasting of faces was imported from traditional maskmaking. Along with make-up advances, fantastic masks could be created which fit the actor perfectly. As material science advanced, horror film maskmaking followed closely.
Many studios established in-house &quot;special effects&quot; departments, which were responsible for nearly all optical and mechanical aspects of motion-picture trickery. Also, the challenge of simulating spectacle in motion encouraged the development of the use of miniatures. Animation, creating the illusion of motion, was accomplished with drawings (most notably by Winsor McCay in &quot;Gertie the Dinosaur&quot;) and with three-dimensional models (most notably by Willis O&#x27;Brien in &quot;The Lost World&quot; and &quot;King Kong&quot;). Naval battles could be depicted with models in studio. Tanks and aeroplanes could be flown (and crashed) without risk of life and limb. Most impressively, miniatures and matte paintings could be used to depict worlds that never existed. Fritz Lang&#x27;s film &quot;Metropolis&quot; was an early special effects spectacular, with innovative use of miniatures, matte paintings, the Schüfftan process, and complex compositing.

An important innovation in special-effects photography was the development of the optical printer. Essentially, an optical printer is a projector aiming into a camera lens, and it was developed to make copies of films for distribution. Until Linwood G. Dunn refined the design and use of the optical printer, effects shots were accomplished as in-camera effects. Dunn demonstrating that it could be used to combine images in novel ways and create new illusions. One early showcase for Dunn was Orson Welles&#x27; &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, where such locations as Xanadu (and some of Gregg Toland&#x27;s famous &#x27;deep focus&#x27; shots) were essentially created by Dunn&#x27;s optical printer.

===Color era===
The development of color photography required greater refinement of effects techniques. Color enabled the development of such &quot;travelling matte&quot; techniques as bluescreen and the sodium vapour process. Many films became landmarks in special-effects accomplishments: &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; used matte paintings, animation, and miniature work to create spectacular alien environments. In &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot;, Paramount&#x27;s John P. Fulton, A.S.C., multiplied the crowds of extras in the Exodus scenes with careful compositing, depicted the massive constructions of Rameses with models, and split the Red Sea in a still-impressive combination of travelling mattes and water tanks. Ray Harryhausen extended the art of stop-motion animation with his special techniques of compositing to create spectacular fantasy adventures such as &quot;Jason and the Argonauts&quot; (whose climax, a sword battle with seven animated skeletons, is considered a landmark in special effects).

===The science fiction boom===
During the 1950s and 1960s numerous new special effects were developed which would dramatically increase the level of realism achievable in science fiction films. Sci-fi special effects milestones in the 1950s included the &quot;Godzilla&quot; films, &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot; (featuring Klaatu), and 3-D films.

The &quot;tokusatsu&quot; genre of Japanese science fiction film and television, which includes the &quot;kaiju&quot; sub-genre of monster films, rose to prominence in the 1950s. The special-effects director Eiji Tsuburaya and the director Ishirō Honda became the driving forces behind the original &quot;Godzilla&quot; (1954). Taking inspiration from &quot;King Kong&quot; (1933), Tsuburaya formulated many of the techniques that would become staples of the &quot;tokusatsu&quot; genre, such as so-called suitmation—the use of a human actor in a costume to play a giant monster—combined with the use of miniatures and scaled-down city sets. &quot;Godzilla&quot; changed the landscape of Japanese cinema, science fiction and fantasy, and kickstarted the &quot;kaiju&quot; genre in Japan called the &quot;Monster Boom&quot;, which remained extremely popular for several decades, with characters such as the aforementioned Godzilla, Gamera and King Ghidorah leading the market. Tokusatsu films, notably &quot;Warning from Space&quot; (1956), sparked Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s interest in science fiction films; according to his biographer John Baxter, despite their &quot;clumsy model sequences, the films were often well-photographed in colour ... and their dismal dialogue was delivered in well-designed and well-lit sets.&quot;
In 1968, Stanley Kubrick assembled his own effects team (Douglas Trumbull, Tom Howard, Con Pederson and Wally Veevers) rather than use an in-house effects unit for &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;. In this film, the spaceship miniatures were highly detailed and carefully photographed for a realistic depth of field. The shots of spaceships were combined through hand-drawn rotoscoping and careful motion-control work, ensuring that the elements were precisely combined in the camera—a surprising throwback to the silent era, but with spectacular results. Backgrounds of the African vistas in the &quot;Dawn of Man&quot; sequence were combined with soundstage photography via the then-new front projection technique. Scenes set in zero-gravity environments were staged with hidden wires, mirror shots, and large-scale rotating sets. The finale, a voyage through hallucinogenic scenery, was created by Douglas Trumbull using a new technique termed slit-scan.

The 1970s provided two profound changes in the special effects trade. The first was economic: during the industry&#x27;s recession in the late 1960s and early 1970s, many studios closed down their in-house effects houses. Technicians became freelancers or founded their own effects companies, sometimes specialising on particular techniques (opticals, animation, etc.).

The second was precipitated by the blockbuster success of two science-fiction and fantasy films in 1977. George Lucas&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars&quot; ushered in an era of science-fiction films with expensive and impressive special effects. Effects supervisor John Dykstra, A.S.C. and crew developed many improvements in existing effects technology. They created a computer-controlled camera rig called the &quot;Dykstraflex&quot; that allowed precise repetition of camera motion, greatly facilitating travelling-matte compositing. Degradation of film images during compositing was minimised by other innovations: the Dykstraflex used VistaVision cameras that photographed widescreen images horizontally along stock, using far more of the film per frame, and thinner-emulsion filmstocks were used in the compositing process. The effects crew assembled by Lucas was dubbed Industrial Light &amp; Magic, and since 1977 has spearheaded many effects innovations.

That same year, Steven Spielberg&#x27;s film &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; boasted a finale with impressive special effects by &quot;2001&quot; veteran Douglas Trumbull. In addition to developing his own motion-control system, Trumbull also developed techniques for creating intentional &quot;lens flare&quot; (the shapes created by light reflecting in camera lenses) to provide the film&#x27;s undefinable shapes of flying saucers.

The success of these films, and others since, has prompted massive studio investment in effects-heavy science-fiction films. This has fuelled the establishment of many independent effects houses, a tremendous degree of refinement of existing techniques, and the development of new techniques such as computer-generated imagery (CGI). It has also encouraged within the industry a greater distinction between special effects and visual effects; the latter is used to characterise post-production and optical work, while &quot;special effects&quot; refers more often to on-set and mechanical effects.

===Introduction of computer-generated imagery (CGI)===
The use of computer animation in film dates back to the early 1980s, with the films &quot;Tron&quot; (1982) and &quot;Golgo 13: The Professional&quot; (1983). Since the 1990s, a profound innovation in special effects has been the development of computer-generated imagery (CGI), which has changed nearly every aspect of motion picture special effects. Digital compositing allows far more control and creative freedom than optical compositing, and does not degrade the image as with analogue (optical) processes. Digital imagery has enabled technicians to create detailed models, matte &quot;paintings,&quot; and even fully realised characters with the malleability of computer software.

Arguably the biggest and most &quot;spectacular&quot; use of CGI is in the creation of photo-realistic images of science-fiction/fantasy characters, settings and objects. Images can be created in a computer using the techniques of animated cartoons and model animation. &quot;The Last Starfighter&quot; (1984) used computer generated spaceships instead of physical scale models. In 1993, stop-motion animators working on the realistic dinosaurs of Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; were retrained in the use of computer input devices. By 1995, films such as &quot;Toy Story&quot; underscored the fact that the distinction between live-action films and animated films was no longer clear. Other landmark examples include a character made up of broken pieces of a stained-glass window in &quot;Young Sherlock Holmes&quot;, a shape-shifting character in &quot;Willow&quot;, a tentacle formed from water in &quot;The Abyss&quot;, the T-1000 Terminator in &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;, hordes and armies of robots and fantastic creatures in the &quot;Star Wars (prequel)&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogies, and the planet, Pandora, in &quot;Avatar&quot;.

==Planning and use==
Although most visual effects work is completed during post-production, it must be carefully planned and choreographed in pre-production and production. A visual effects supervisor is usually involved with the production from an early stage to work closely with the Director and all related personnel to achieve the desired effects.

Practical effects also require significant pre-planning and co-ordination with performers and production teams. The live nature of the effects can result in situations where resetting due to an error, mistake, or safety concern incurs significant expense, or is impossible due to the destructive nature of the effect.

==Live special effects==
Live special effects are effects that are used in front of a live audience, such as in theatre, sporting generation genre, concerts and corporate shows. Types of effects that are commonly used include: flying effects, laser lighting, theatrical smoke and fog, CO2 effects, and pyrotechnics. Other atmospheric effects can include flame, confetti, bubbles, and snow.

One notable example of live special effects in theatre production is in the Bregenz Festival with its use of a large, intricate stage that moves to supplement what&#x27;s being acted on stage.

==Mechanical effects==
Mechanical effects encompass the use of mechanical engineering to a greater degree. Cars being flipped and hauled over buildings are usually an effect built on specialised rigs and gimbals. Usually a team of engineers or freelance film companies provide these effects to producers. Camera workers, stunt artists or doubles, directors and engineers collaborate to produce the proper effect as the action is recorded against a green screen. It is then edited and reviewed before final release to the public.

<text>A supergroup is a musical group formed of members who are already successful as solo artists or as members of other successful groups. The term became popular in the late 1960s when members of already successful rock groups recorded albums together, after which they normally disbanded. Charity supergroups, in which prominent musicians perform or record together in support of a particular cause, have been common since the 1980s. The term is most common in the context of rock and pop music, but it has occasionally been applied to other musical genres. For example, opera stars the Three Tenors (José Carreras, Plácido Domingo, and Luciano Pavarotti) and hip hop duos Kids See Ghosts (Kanye West and Kid Cudi) and Bad Meets Evil (Eminem and Royce da 5&#x27;9&quot;) all have been called supergroups.

A supergroup sometimes forms as a side project for a single recording project or other &quot;ad hoc&quot; purposes, with no intention that the group will remain together afterwards. In other instances, the group may become the primary focus of the members&#x27; career.

==History==
&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; editor Jann Wenner credited British rock band Cream, which came together in 1966, as the first supergroup. Eric Clapton, formerly of rock band The Yardbirds and blues rock band John Mayall &amp; the Bluesbreakers; Jack Bruce, formerly of jazz/rhythm and blues band the Graham Bond Organisation (GBO) and John Mayall &amp; the Bluesbreakers; and Ginger Baker, formerly of the GBO, formed the band in 1966, recorded four albums, and disbanded in 1968. Guitarist Clapton and drummer Baker went on to form Blind Faith, another blues rock supergroup which recruited former Spencer Davis Group and Traffic singer, keyboardist, and guitarist Steve Winwood and Family bassist Ric Grech. The group recorded one studio album before disbanding less than a year after formation. Also in 1968 Jack Bruce joined the Tony Williams Lifetime, composed of bassist and vocalist Bruce, and three famous Miles Davis alumni: drummer Tony Williams, guitarist John McLaughlin, and keyboardist Khalid Yasin (né Larry Young).

The term may have come from the 1968 album &quot;Super Session&quot; with Al Kooper, Mike Bloomfield, and Stephen Stills. The coalition of Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young (formerly Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash) in 1969 is another early example, given the success of their prior bands (the Byrds, Buffalo Springfield, and the Hollies respectively).

While the practice had declined by the 80s, in 1985 country superstars Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, Kris Kristofferson and Waylon Jennings formed the first country supergroup, Highwaymen, going on to achieve three chart singles. Perhaps the most decorated line-up, the supergroup Traveling Wilburys was formed in 1988, consisting of Bob Dylan, George Harrison, Jeff Lynne, Roy Orbison and Tom Petty.

In the early 2000s, supergroups such as Audioslave and Velvet Revolver made their mark. Audioslave was created in 2001, composed of ex-members of Rage Against the Machine and Chris Cornell from Soundgarden. The members of Guns N’ Roses and Scott Weiland from Stone Temple Pilots came together to form Velvet Revolver in 2002. This is a time when supergroups were experiencing a revival; established musicians looked for new platforms to express themselves, as they brought their different genres closer through collaborations that utilized their shared popularity so as to build something fresh and thrilling 

A contemporary example of a supergroup is FFS, a collaboration between Scottish indie rock band Franz Ferdinand and American art rock band Sparks, Other prominent examples include Atoms for Peace and Boygenius.

==Criticism of the expression==
The very definition of a &quot;supergroup&quot; hinges on the members already having been &quot;successful&quot;. This itself is a subjective term, though metrics such as career earnings, records sold, number of commercial hit songs written and musician longevity can all be used to establish the objective success of a musical band and its individual members.

Tyler Golsen in &quot;Far Out&quot; writes that &quot;Today, the term “supergroup” has something of a negative connotation. It usually signifies a short-term vanity project that attempts to profit off members’ reputations with their past works&quot;.

In 1974, a &quot;Time&quot; magazine article titled &quot;Return of a Supergroup&quot; quipped that the supergroup was a &quot;potent but short-lived rock phenomenon&quot; which was an &quot;amalgam formed by the talented malcontents of other bands&quot;. The article acknowledged that groups such as Cream and Blind Faith &quot;played enormous arenas and made megabucks, and sometimes megamusic&quot;, with the performances &quot;fueled by dueling egos&quot;. However, while this &quot;musical infighting built up the excitement ... it also made breakups inevitable.&quot;

<text>Muammar Muhammad Abu Minyar al-Gaddafi (20 October 2011) was a Libyan revolutionary, politician and political theorist who ruled Libya from 1969 until his assassination by the rebel forces of the National Liberation Army in 2011. He came to power through a military coup, first becoming Revolutionary Chairman of the Libyan Arab Republic from 1969 to 1977 and then the &#x27;Brotherly Leader&#x27; of the Great Socialist People&#x27;s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya from 1977 to 2011. Initially ideologically committed to Arab nationalism and Nasserism, Gaddafi later ruled according to his own Third International Theory.
Born near Sirte, Italian Libya, to a poor Bedouin Arab family, Gaddafi became an Arab nationalist while at school in Sabha, later enrolling in the Royal Military Academy, Benghazi. He founded a revolutionary group known as the Free Officers movement which deposed the Western-backed Senussi monarchy of Idris in a 1969 coup. Gaddafi converted Libya into a republic governed by his Revolutionary Command Council. Ruling by decree, he deported Libya&#x27;s Italian population and ejected its Western military bases. He strengthened ties to Arab nationalist governments and unsuccessfully advocated pan-Arab political union. An Islamic modernist, he introduced &quot;sharia&quot; as the basis for the legal system and promoted Islamic socialism. He nationalized the oil industry and used the increasing state revenues to bolster the military, fund foreign revolutionaries, and implement social programs emphasizing housebuilding, healthcare and education projects. In 1973, he initiated a &quot;Popular Revolution&quot; with the formation of Basic People&#x27;s Congresses, presented as a system of direct democracy, but retained personal control over major decisions. He outlined his Third International Theory that year in &quot;The Green Book&quot;.
In 1977 Gaddafi transformed Libya into a new socialist state called a &quot;Jamahiriya&quot; (&quot;state of the masses&quot;). He officially adopted a symbolic role in governance but remained head of both the military and the Revolutionary Committees responsible for policing and suppressing dissent. During the 1970s and 1980s, Libya&#x27;s unsuccessful border conflicts with Egypt and Chad, support for foreign militants, and alleged responsibility for bombings of Pan Am Flight 103 and UTA Flight 772 left it increasingly isolated on the world stage. A particularly hostile relationship developed with Israel, the United States and the United Kingdom, resulting in the 1986 U.S. bombing of Libya and United Nations–imposed economic sanctions. From 1999, Gaddafi shunned pan-Arabism, and encouraged pan-Africanism and rapprochement with Western nations; he was Chairperson of the African Union from 2009 to 2010. Amid the 2011 Arab Spring, protests against widespread corruption and unemployment broke out in eastern Libya. The situation descended into civil war, in which NATO intervened militarily on the side of the anti-Gaddafist National Transitional Council (NTC). Gaddafi&#x27;s government was overthrown; he retreated to Sirte only to be captured, tortured and killed by NTC militants.
A highly divisive figure, Gaddafi dominated Libya&#x27;s politics for four decades and was the subject of a pervasive cult of personality. He was decorated with various awards and praised for his anti-imperialist stance, support for Arab—and then African—unity, as well as for significant development to the country following the discovery of oil reserves. Conversely, many Libyans strongly opposed Gaddafi&#x27;s social and economic reforms; he was accused of various human rights violations. He was condemned by many as a dictator whose authoritarian administration systematically violated human rights and financed global terrorism in the region and abroad.
==Early life and career==

===Childhood: 1940s to 1950===
Muammar Mohammed Abu Minyar al-Gaddafi was born near Qasr Abu Hadi, a rural area outside the town of Sirte in the deserts of Tripolitania, Italian western Libya. His family came from a small, relatively uninfluential tribe called the Qadhadhfa, who were Arab in heritage. His mother was Aisha bin Niran, and his father, Mohammad Abdul Salam bin Hamed bin Mohammad, was known as Abu Meniar; the latter earned a meager subsistence as a goat and camel herder.

Like other contemporary nomadic Bedouin tribes, the family were illiterate and did not keep any birth records. His birthday is not known with certainty and sources have set it in 1942 or the spring of 1943, although his biographers David Blundy and Andrew Lycett noted that it could have been pre-1940. His parents&#x27; only surviving son, he had three older sisters. Gaddafi&#x27;s upbringing in Bedouin culture influenced his personal tastes; he preferred the desert over the city and would retreat there to meditate.

From childhood, Gaddafi was aware of the involvement of European colonial powers in Libya; his nation was occupied by Italy, and during the North African Campaign of the Second World War it witnessed conflict between Italian and British forces. According to later claims, Gaddafi&#x27;s paternal grandfather, Abdessalam Bouminyar, was killed by the Italian Army during the Italian invasion of 1911. At the end of the Second World War in 1945, Libya was occupied by British and French forces. Britain and France considered dividing the nation between their empires, but the General Assembly of the United Nations (UN) decided that the country was to be granted political independence, and in 1951 created the United Kingdom of Libya, a federal state under the leadership of a pro-Western monarch, Idris, who banned political parties and centralized power in his own hands.

===Education and political activism: 1950–1963===

Gaddafi&#x27;s earliest education was of a religious nature, imparted by a local Islamic teacher. Subsequently, moving to nearby Sirte to attend elementary school, he progressed through six grades in four years. Education in Libya was not free, but his father thought it would greatly benefit his son despite the financial strain. During the week Gaddafi slept in a mosque, and only at weekends and holidays walked to visit his parents. Even though Gaddafi&#x27;s father was not educated, he made great sacrifices to send his son to school. As an impoverished Bedouin, he faced bullying and discrimination from his city-dwelling classmates. However, he had many Egyptian teachers who informed him of the dramatic events occurring in their homeland. From Sirte, he and his family moved to the market town of Sabha in Fezzan, south-central Libya, where his father worked as a caretaker for a tribal leader while Muammar attended secondary school, something neither parent had done. Gaddafi was popular at this school; some friends made there received significant jobs in his later administration, most notably his best friend, Abdul Salam Jalloud.

Many teachers at Sabha were Egyptian, and for the first time, Gaddafi had access to pan-Arab newspapers and radio broadcasts, especially the Cairo-based &quot;Voice of the Arabs&quot;. Growing up, Gaddafi witnessed significant events severely disturb the Arab world, including the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, the Suez Crisis of 1956, and the short-lived existence of the United Arab Republic (UAR) between 1958 and 1961. Gaddafi admired the political changes implemented in the Arab Republic of Egypt under his hero, President Gamal Abdel Nasser. Nasser argued for Arab nationalism; the rejection of Western colonialism, neo-colonialism, and Zionism; and a transition from capitalism to socialism. Gaddafi was influenced by Nasser&#x27;s book, &quot;Philosophy of the Revolution&quot;, which outlined how to initiate a coup. One of Gaddafi&#x27;s Egyptian teachers, Mahmoud Efay, was reportedly sympathetic towards the youth&#x27;s political ideas, and advised him that a successful revolution would need the support of the army.

Gaddafi organized demonstrations and distributed posters criticizing the monarchy. In October 1961, he led a demonstration protesting against Syria&#x27;s secession from the UAR and raised funds to send cables of support to Nasser. Twenty students were arrested as a result of the disorder. Gaddafi and his companions also broke windows in a local hotel that was accused of serving alcohol. To punish Gaddafi, the authorities expelled him and his family from Sabha. Gaddafi moved to Misrata, there attending Misrata Secondary School. Maintaining his interest in Arab nationalist activism, he refused to join any of the banned political parties active in the city—including the Arab Nationalist Movement, the Arab Socialist Ba&#x27;ath Party, and the Muslim Brotherhood—claiming that he rejected factionalism. He read voraciously on the subjects of Nasser and the French Revolution of 1789, as well as the works of the Syrian political theorist Michel Aflaq and biographies of Abraham Lincoln, Sun Yat-sen, and Mustafa Kemal Atatürk.

===Military training: 1963–1966===
Gaddafi briefly studied history at the University of Libya in Benghazi before dropping out to join the military. Despite his police record, in 1963 he began training at the Royal Military Academy, Benghazi, alongside several like-minded friends from Misrata. The armed forces offered the only opportunity for upward social mobility for underprivileged Libyans, and Gaddafi recognized it as a potential instrument of political change. Under Idris, Libya&#x27;s armed forces were trained by the British military; this angered Gaddafi, who viewed the British as imperialists, and accordingly, he refused to learn English and was rude to the British officers, ultimately failing his exams. British trainers reported him for insubordination and abusive behaviour, stating their suspicion that he was involved in the assassination of the military academy&#x27;s commander in 1963. Such reports were ignored, and Gaddafi quickly progressed through the course.

With a group of loyal cadres, in 1964, Gaddafi established the Central Committee of the Free Officers Movement, a revolutionary group named after Nasser&#x27;s Egyptian predecessor. Led by Gaddafi, they met secretively and were organized into a clandestine cell system, pooling their salaries into a single fund. Gaddafi travelled around Libya collecting intelligence and developing connections with sympathizers, but the government&#x27;s intelligence services ignored him, considering him little threat. Graduating in August 1965, Gaddafi became a communications officer in the army&#x27;s signal corps.

In April 1966, he was assigned to the United Kingdom for further training; over nine months he underwent an English-language course at Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, an Army Air Corps signal instructors course in Bovington Camp, Dorset, and an infantry signal instructors course at Hythe, Kent. Despite later rumours to the contrary, he did not attend the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. The Bovington signal course&#x27;s director reported that Gaddafi successfully overcame problems learning English, displaying a firm command of voice procedure. Noting that Gaddafi&#x27;s favourite hobbies were reading and playing football, he thought of him as an &quot;amusing officer, always cheerful, hard-working, and conscientious&quot;. Gaddafi disliked England, claiming British Army officers had racially insulted him and finding it difficult adjusting to the country&#x27;s culture; asserting his Arab identity in London, he walked around Piccadilly wearing traditional Libyan robes. He later related that while he travelled to England believing it more advanced than Libya, he returned home &quot;more confident and proud of our values, ideals and social character&quot;.

==Libyan Arab Republic==
===Coup d&#x27;état: 1969===


Idris&#x27; government was increasingly unpopular by the latter 1960s; it had exacerbated Libya&#x27;s traditional regional and tribal divisions by centralizing the country&#x27;s federal system to take advantage of the country&#x27;s oil wealth. Corruption and entrenched systems of patronage were widespread throughout the oil industry. Arab nationalism was increasingly popular, and protests flared up following Egypt&#x27;s 1967 defeat in the Six-Day War with Israel; Idris&#x27; administration was seen as pro-Israeli due to its alliance with the Western powers. Anti-Western riots broke out in Tripoli and Benghazi, while Libyan workers shut down oil terminals in solidarity with Egypt. By 1969, the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was expecting segments of Libya&#x27;s armed forces to launch a coup. Although claims have been made that they knew of Gaddafi&#x27;s Free Officers Movement, they have since claimed ignorance, stating that they were instead monitoring Abdul Aziz Shalhi&#x27;s Black Boots revolutionary group. Shalhi, who effectively served as Idris&#x27; chief of staff, and his brother Omar were the sons of Idris&#x27; former chief advisor Ibrahim Shalhi, who had been murdered by Queen Fatima&#x27;s nephew in the fall of 1954. After their father&#x27;s assassination, they became the favorites of Idris.

In mid-1969, Idris travelled abroad to spend the summer in Turkey and Greece amid widespread rumors of an abdication or a British-backed coup by the Shalhi brothers on 5 September. Gaddafi&#x27;s Free Officers, recognizing this as their last chance to preempt the Shelhis in overthrowing the monarchy, initiated &quot;Operation Jerusalem&quot;. If Gaddafi&#x27;s Free Officers had not preempted the Shelhis, they would have almost certainly been defeated by the combined forces of Abdul Aziz Shelhi, the deputy commander of Libya&#x27;s army, and the prominent families in Cyrenaica that supported the Shelhi family. On 1 September, Gaddafi&#x27;s Free Officers occupied airports, police depots, radio stations, and government offices in Tripoli and Benghazi. Gaddafi took control of the Berka barracks in Benghazi, while Umar Muhayshi occupied Tripoli barracks and Jalloud seized the city&#x27;s anti-aircraft batteries. Khweldi Hameidi took over the Tripoli radio station and was sent to arrest crown prince Sayyid Hasan ar-Rida al-Mahdi as-Sanussi and force him to relinquish his claim to the throne. They met no serious resistance and wielded little violence against the monarchists.

Once Gaddafi removed the monarchical government, he announced the foundation of the Libyan Arab Republic. Addressing the populace by radio, he proclaimed an end to the &quot;reactionary and corrupt&quot; regime, &quot;the stench of which has sickened and horrified us all&quot;. Due to the coup&#x27;s bloodless nature, it was initially labelled the &quot;White Revolution&quot;, although was later renamed the &quot;One September Revolution&quot; after the date on which it occurred. Gaddafi insisted that the Free Officers&#x27; coup represented a revolution, marking the start of widespread change in the socio-economic and political nature of Libya. He proclaimed that the revolution meant &quot;freedom, socialism, and unity&quot;, and over the coming years implemented measures to achieve this.

===Consolidating leadership: 1969–1973===
The 12-member central committee of the Free Officers proclaimed themselves the Revolutionary Command Council (RCC), the government of the new republic. Lieutenant Gaddafi became RCC chairman, and therefore the &quot;de facto&quot; head of state, also appointing himself to the rank of colonel and becoming commander-in-chief of the armed forces. Jalloud became Prime Minister, while a civilian Council of Ministers headed by Sulaiman Maghribi was founded to implement RCC policy. Libya&#x27;s administrative capital was moved from al-Beida to Tripoli.

Although theoretically a collegial body operating through consensus building, Gaddafi dominated the RCC. Some of the others attempted to constrain what they saw as his excesses. Gaddafi remained the government&#x27;s public face, with the identities of the other RCC members only being publicly revealed on 10 January 1970. All young men from (typically rural) working and middle-class backgrounds, none had university degrees; in this way they were distinct from the wealthy, highly educated conservatives who previously governed the country.

The coup completed, the RCC proceeded with their intentions of consolidating the revolutionary government and modernizing the country. They purged monarchists and members of Idris&#x27; Senussi clan from Libya&#x27;s political world and armed forces; Gaddafi believed this elite were opposed to the will of the Libyan people and had to be expunged. People&#x27;s Courts were founded to try various monarchist politicians and journalists, many of whom were imprisoned, although none executed. Idris was sentenced to execution &quot;in absentia&quot;. Three months after Gaddafi came to power, the army minister and interior minister, both of whom were from the eastern Barqa region, tried to overthrow him in a failed coup. In 1970, Idris&#x27; great nephew Ahmed al-Senussi tried to instigate another coup against Gaddafi; the monarchist plot was foiled in August and Ahmed was sentenced to death (commuted in 1988 and pardoned by Gaddafi in 2001).

In May 1970, the Revolutionary Intellectuals Seminar was held to bring intellectuals in line with the revolution, while that year&#x27;s Legislative Review and Amendment united secular and religious law codes, introducing &quot;sharia&quot; into the legal system. Ruling by decree, the RCC maintained the monarchy&#x27;s ban on political parties, in May 1970 banned trade unions, and in 1972 outlawed workers&#x27; strikes and suspended newspapers. In September 1971, Gaddafi resigned, claiming to be dissatisfied with the pace of reform, but returned to his position within a month. In July 1972, amid widespread speculation that Gaddafi had been ousted or jailed by his political opponents, a new 18-man cabinet was formed with only two of them, Jalloud and Abdel Moneim al-Houni, being military men; the rest were civilian technocrats per Gaddafi&#x27;s insistence. In February 1973, Gaddafi resigned again, once more returning the following month.

====Economic and social reform====

The RCC&#x27;s early economic policy has been characterized as being state capitalist in orientation. Many initiatives were established to aid entrepreneurs and develop a Libyan bourgeoisie. Seeking to expand the cultivatable acreage in Libya, in September 1969 the government launched a &quot;Green Revolution&quot; to increase agricultural productivity so that Libya could rely less on imported food. The hope was to make Libya self-sufficient in food production. All land that had either been expropriated from Italian settlers or which was not in use was repossessed and redistributed. Irrigation systems were established along the northern coastline and around various inland oases. Production costs often surpassed the value of the produce and thus Libyan agricultural production remained in deficit, relying heavily on state subsidies.

With crude oil as the country&#x27;s primary export, Gaddafi sought to improve Libya&#x27;s oil sector. In October 1969, he proclaimed the current trade terms unfair, benefiting foreign corporations more than the Libyan state, and threatened to decrease production. In December Jalloud successfully increased the price of Libyan oil. In 1970, other OPEC states followed suit, leading to a global increase in the price of crude oil. The RCC followed with the Tripoli Agreement of 20 March 1971, in which they secured income tax, back-payments and better pricing from the oil corporations; these measures brought Libya an estimated $1 billion in additional revenues in its first year.

Increasing state control over the oil sector, the RCC began a program of nationalization, starting with the expropriation of British Petroleum&#x27;s share of the British Petroleum-N.B. Hunt Sahir Field in December 1971. In September 1973, it was announced that all foreign oil producers active in Libya were to see 51 per cent of their operation nationalized, including the stake of Nelson Bunker Hunt, son of H.L. Hunt, who had played a key role in the discovery of oil in Libya. Among the companies that were partially nationalized was Armand Hammer&#x27;s Occidental Petroleum. For Gaddafi, this was an essential step towards socialism. It proved an economic success; while gross domestic product had been $3.8 billion in 1969, it had risen to $13.7 billion in 1974, and $24.5 billion in 1979. In turn, the Libyans&#x27; standard of life greatly improved over the first decade of Gaddafi&#x27;s administration, and by 1979 the average per-capita income was at $8,170, up from $40 in 1951; this was above the average of many industrialized countries like Italy and the UK. In 1969, the government also declared that all foreign owned banks must either close down or convert to joint-stock operations.

The RCC implemented measures for social reform, adopting &quot;sharia&quot; as a basis. The consumption of alcohol was prohibited, night clubs and Christian churches were shut down, traditional Libyan dress was encouraged, and Arabic was decreed as the only language permitted in official communications and on road signs. The RCC doubled the minimum wage, introduced statutory price controls, and implemented compulsory rent reductions of between 30 and 40 per cent. Gaddafi also wanted to combat the strict social restrictions that had been imposed on women by the previous regime, establishing the Revolutionary Women&#x27;s Formation to encourage reform. In 1970, a law was introduced affirming equality of the sexes and insisting on wage parity. In 1971, Gaddafi sponsored the creation of a Libyan General Women&#x27;s Federation. In 1972, a law was passed criminalizing the marriage of any females under the age of sixteen and ensuring that a woman&#x27;s consent was a necessary prerequisite for a marriage. Gaddafi&#x27;s regime opened up a wide range of educational and employment opportunities for women, although these primarily benefited a minority in the urban middle-classes.

From 1969 to 1973, it used oil money to fund social welfare programs, which led to housebuilding projects and improved healthcare and education. House building became a major social priority, designed to eliminate homelessness and to replace the shanty towns created by Libya&#x27;s growing urbanization. The health sector was also expanded; by 1978, Libya had 50 per cent more hospitals than it had in 1968, while the number of doctors had increased from 700 to over 3000 in that decade. Malaria was eradicated, and trachoma and tuberculosis greatly curtailed. Compulsory education was expanded from 6 to 9 years, while adult literacy programs and free university education were introduced. Beida University was founded, while Tripoli University and Benghazi University were expanded. In doing so, the government helped to integrate the poorer strata of Libyan society into the education system. Through these measures, the RCC greatly expanded the public sector, providing employment for thousands. These early social programs proved popular within Libya. This popularity was partly due to Gaddafi&#x27;s personal charisma, youth and underdog status as a Bedouin, as well as his rhetoric emphasizing his role as the successor to the anti-Italian fighter Omar Mukhtar.

To combat the country&#x27;s strong regional and tribal divisions, the RCC promoted the idea of a unified pan-Libyan identity. In doing so, they tried discrediting tribal leaders as agents of the old regime, and in August 1971 a Sabha military court tried many of them for counter-revolutionary activity. Long-standing administrative boundaries were re-drawn, crossing tribal boundaries, while pro-revolutionary modernizers replaced traditional leaders, yet the communities they served often rejected them. Realizing the failures of the modernizers, Gaddafi created the Arab Socialist Union (ASU) in June 1971, a mass mobilization vanguard party of which he was president. The ASU recognized the RCC as its &quot;Supreme Leading Authority&quot;, and was designed to further revolutionary enthusiasm throughout the country. It remained heavily bureaucratic and failed to mobilize mass support in the way Gaddafi had envisioned.

====Foreign relations====

The influence of Nasser&#x27;s Arab nationalism over the RCC was immediately apparent. The administration was instantly recognized by the neighbouring Arab nationalist regimes in Egypt, Syria, Iraq, and Sudan, with Egypt sending experts to aid the inexperienced RCC. Gaddafi propounded pan-Arab ideas, proclaiming the need for a single Arab state stretching across North Africa and the Middle East. In December 1969, Libya signed the Tripoli Charter alongside Egypt and Sudan. This established the Arab Revolutionary Front, a pan-national union designed as a first step towards the eventual political unification of the three nations. In 1970 Syria declared its intention to join.

Nasser died unexpectedly in September 1970, with Gaddafi playing a prominent role at his funeral. Nasser was succeeded by Anwar Sadat, who suggested that rather than creating a unified state, the Arab states should create a political federation, implemented in April 1971; in doing so, Egypt, Syria, and Sudan received large grants of Libyan oil money. In July 1971, Gaddafi sided with Sadat against the Soviet Union in the 1971 Sudanese coup d&#x27;état and dispatched Libyan fighter jets to force down a British Airlines jetliner carrying the leading coup plotters, Farouk Osman Hamadallah and Babikir al-Nour. They were extradited back to Khartoum, where they were promptly executed by Sudanese leader Jaafar Nimeiry. In February 1972, Gaddafi and Sadat signed an unofficial charter of merger, but it was never implemented because relations broke down the following year. Sadat became increasingly wary of Libya&#x27;s radical direction, and the September 1973 deadline for implementing the Federation passed by with no action taken.

After the 1969 coup, representatives of the Four Powers—France, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union—were called to meet RCC representatives. The UK and the US quickly extended diplomatic recognition, hoping to secure the position of their military bases in Libya and fearing further instability. Hoping to ingratiate themselves with Gaddafi, in 1970 the US informed him of at least one planned counter-coup. Such attempts to form a working relationship with the RCC failed; Gaddafi was determined to reassert national sovereignty and expunge what he described as foreign colonial and imperialist influences. His administration insisted that the US and the UK remove their military bases from Libya, with Gaddafi proclaiming that &quot;the armed forces which rose to express the people&#x27;s revolution [will not] tolerate living in their shacks while the bases of imperialism exist in Libyan territory.&quot; The British left in March and the Americans in June 1970.

Moving to reduce Italian influence, in October 1970 all Italian-owned assets were expropriated, and the 12,000-strong Italian community was expelled from Libya alongside the smaller community of Libyan Jews. The day became a national holiday known as &quot;Vengeance Day&quot;. Italy complained that this was in contravention of the 1956 Italo-Libyan Treaty, although no UN sanctions were forthcoming. Aiming to reduce NATO power in the Mediterranean, in 1971 Libya requested that Malta cease allowing NATO to use its land for a military base, in turn offering Malta foreign aid. Compromising, Malta&#x27;s government continued allowing NATO to use the island, but only on the condition that NATO would not use it for launching attacks on Arab territory. Over the coming decade, Gaddafi&#x27;s government developed stronger political and economic links with Dom Mintoff&#x27;s Maltese administration, and under Libya&#x27;s urging Malta did not renew the UK&#x27;s airbases on the island in 1980. Orchestrating a military build-up, the RCC began purchasing weapons from France and the Soviet Union. The commercial relationship with the latter led to an increasingly strained relationship with the US, which was then engaged in the Cold War with the Soviets.

Gaddafi was especially critical of the US due to its support of Israel and sided with the Palestinians in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, viewing the 1948 creation of the State of Israel as a Western colonial occupation forced upon the Arab world. He believed that Palestinian violence against Israeli and Western targets was the justified response of an oppressed people who were fighting against the colonization of their homeland. Calling on the Arab states to wage &quot;continuous war&quot; against Israel, in 1970 he initiated a Jihad Fund to finance anti-Israeli militants. In June 1972 Gaddafi created the First Nasserite Volunteers Centre to train anti-Israeli guerrillas.

Like Nasser, Gaddafi favoured the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and his group, Fatah, over more militant and Marxist Palestinian groups. As the years progressed however, Gaddafi&#x27;s relationship with Arafat became strained, with Gaddafi considering him too moderate and calling for more violent action. Instead, he supported militias like the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – General Command, the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, As-Sa&#x27;iqa, the Palestinian Popular Struggle Front, and the Abu Nidal Organization. He funded the Black September Organization whose members perpetrated the 1972 Munich massacre of Israeli athletes in West Germany and had the killed militants&#x27; bodies flown to Libya for a hero&#x27;s funeral.

Gaddafi financially supported other militant groups across the world, including the Black Panther Party, the Nation of Islam, the Almighty Black P. Stone Nation, the Tupamaros, the 19th of April Movement and the Sandinista National Liberation Front in Nicaragua, the ANC among other liberation movements in the fight against Apartheid in South Africa, the Provisional Irish Republican Army, ETA, Action directe, the Red Brigades, and the Red Army Faction in Europe, and the Armenian Secret Army, the Japanese Red Army, the Free Aceh Movement, and the Moro National Liberation Front in the Philippines. Gaddafi was indiscriminate in the causes which he funded, sometimes switching from supporting one side in a conflict to the other, as in the Eritrean War of Independence. Throughout the 1970s these groups received financial support from Libya, which came to be seen as a leader in the Third World&#x27;s struggle against colonialism and neocolonialism. Though many of these groups were labelled &quot;terrorists&quot; by critics of their activities, Gaddafi rejected this characterization, instead considering them to be revolutionaries who were engaged in liberation struggles.

===The &quot;Popular Revolution&quot;: 1973–1977===

On 16 April 1973, Gaddafi proclaimed the start of a &quot;Popular Revolution&quot; in a speech at Zuwarah. He initiated this with a five-point plan, the first point of which dissolved all existing laws, to be replaced by revolutionary enactments. The second point proclaimed that all opponents of the revolution had to be removed, while the third initiated an administrative revolution that Gaddafi proclaimed would remove all traces of bureaucracy and the bourgeoisie. The fourth point announced that the population must form People&#x27;s Committees and be armed to defend the revolution, while the fifth proclaimed the beginning of the Cultural Revolution in Libya, to expunge the country of &quot;poisonous&quot; foreign influences. He began to lecture on this new phase of the revolution in Libya, Egypt, and France. As a process, it had many similarities with the Cultural Revolution implemented in China.

As part of this Popular Revolution, Gaddafi invited Libya&#x27;s people to found General People&#x27;s Committees as conduits for raising political consciousness. Although offering little guidance for how to set up these councils, Gaddafi claimed that they would offer a form of direct political participation that was more democratic than a traditional party-based representative system. He hoped that the councils would mobilize the people behind the RCC, erode the power of the traditional leaders and the bureaucracy, and allow for a new legal system chosen by the people. Many such committees were established in schools and colleges, where they were responsible for vetting staff, courses, and textbooks to determine if they were compatible with the country&#x27;s revolutionary ideology.

The People&#x27;s Committees led to a high percentage of public involvement in decision making, within the limits permitted by the RCC, but exacerbated tribal divisions and tensions. They also served as a surveillance system, aiding the security services in locating individuals with views critical of the RCC, leading to the arrest of Ba&#x27;athists, Marxists, and Islamists. Operating in a pyramid structure, the base form of these Committees were local working groups, who sent elected representatives to the district level, and from there to the national level, divided between the General People&#x27;s Congress and the General People&#x27;s Committee. Above these remained Gaddafi and the RCC, who remained responsible for all major decisions. In crossing regional and tribal identities, the committee system aided national integration and centralization and tightened Gaddafi&#x27;s control over the state and administrative apparatus.

==== Third International Theory and &quot;The Green Book&quot; ====
In June 1973, Gaddafi created a political ideology as a basis for the Popular Revolution: Third International Theory. This approach regarded both the US and the Soviet Union as imperialist and thus rejected Western capitalism as well as Marxist–Leninist atheism. In this respect, it was similar to the Three Worlds Theory developed by China&#x27;s political leader Mao Zedong. As part of this theory, Gaddafi praised nationalism as a progressive force and advocated the creation of a pan-Arab state which would lead the Islamic and Third Worlds against imperialism. Gaddafi saw Islam as having a key role in this ideology, calling for an Islamic revival that returned to the origins of the Qur&#x27;an, rejecting scholarly interpretations and the Hadith; in doing so, he angered many Libyan clerics. During 1973 and 1974, his government deepened the legal reliance on &quot;sharia&quot;, for instance by introducing flogging as punishment for those convicted of adultery or homosexual activity.

Gaddafi summarized Third International Theory in three short volumes published between 1975 and 1979, collectively known as &quot;The Green Book&quot;. Volume one was devoted to the issue of democracy, outlining the flaws of representative systems in favour of direct, participatory GPCs. The second dealt with Gaddafi&#x27;s beliefs regarding socialism, while the third explored social issues regarding the family and the tribe. While the first two volumes advocated radical reform, the third adopted a socially conservative stance, proclaiming that while men and women were equal, they were biologically designed for different roles in life. During the years that followed, Gaddafists adopted quotes from &quot;The Green Book&quot;, such as &quot;Representation is Fraud&quot;, as slogans. Meanwhile, in September 1975, Gaddafi implemented further measures to increase popular mobilization, introducing objectives to improve the relationship between the Councils and the ASU.

In 1975, Gaddafi&#x27;s government declared a state monopoly on foreign trade. Its increasingly radical reforms, coupled with the large amount of oil revenue being spent on foreign causes, generated discontent in Libya, particularly among the country&#x27;s merchant class. In 1974, Libya saw its first civilian attack on Gaddafi&#x27;s government when a Benghazi army building was bombed. Much of the opposition centred around RCC member Umar Muhayshi. With fellow RCC members Bashir Saghir al-Hawaadi and Awad Ali Hamza, he began plotting a coup against Gaddafi. In 1975, their plot was exposed and Muhayshi fled to Tunisia, eventually receiving asylum from Sadat&#x27;s Egypt. Hawaadi, Hamza, and Omar El-Hariri were arrested. Most of the other conspirators were executed in March 1976. Another RCC member, foreign minister Abdul-Munim al-Huni, also fled to Egypt. In the aftermath, only five RCC members remained: Gaddafi, Jalloud, Abu-Bakr Yunis Jabr, Mustafa Kharubi, and Kweldi al-Hamidi. Thus, power was further concentrated in Gaddafi&#x27;s hands. This ultimately led to the RCC&#x27;s official abolition in March 1977.

In September 1975, Gaddafi purged the army, arresting around 200 senior officers, and in October he founded the clandestine Office for the Security of the Revolution. In April 1976, he called upon his supporters in universities to establish &quot;revolutionary student councils&quot; and drive out &quot;reactionary elements&quot;. During that year, anti-Gaddafist student demonstrations broke out at the universities of Tripoli and Benghazi, resulting in clashes with both Gaddafist students and police. The RCC responded with mass arrests and introduced compulsory national service for young people. In January 1977, two dissenting students and a number of army officers were publicly hanged; Amnesty International condemned it as the first time in Gaddafist Libya that dissenters had been executed for purely political crimes. Dissent also arose from conservative clerics and the Muslim Brotherhood, who accused Gaddafi of moving towards Marxism and criticized his abolition of private property as being against the Islamic &quot;sunnah&quot;; these forces were then persecuted as anti-revolutionary, while all privately owned Islamic colleges and universities were shut down.

====Foreign relations====

Following Anwar Sadat&#x27;s ascension to the Egyptian presidency, Libya&#x27;s relations with Egypt deteriorated. Over the coming years, the two slipped into a state of cold war. Sadat was perturbed by Gaddafi&#x27;s unpredictability and insistence that Egypt required a cultural revolution akin to that being carried out in Libya. In February 1973, Israeli forces shot down Libyan Arab Airlines Flight 114, which had strayed from Egyptian airspace into Israeli-held territory during a sandstorm. Gaddafi&#x27;s foreign minister Salah Busir was on board and allegedly targeted by Israel in retaliation for the Munich massacre. Gaddafi was infuriated that Egypt had not done more to prevent the incident, and in retaliation planned to destroy the &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot;, a British ship chartered by American Jews to sail to Haifa for Israel&#x27;s 25th anniversary. Gaddafi ordered an Egyptian submarine to target the ship, but Sadat cancelled the order, fearing a military escalation.

Gaddafi was later infuriated when Egypt and Syria planned the Yom Kippur War against Israel without consulting him and was angered when Egypt conceded to peace talks rather than continuing the war. Gaddafi became openly hostile to Egypt&#x27;s leader, calling for Sadat&#x27;s overthrow. When Sudanese President Gaafar Nimeiry took Sadat&#x27;s side, Gaddafi also spoke out against him, encouraging the Sudan People&#x27;s Liberation Army&#x27;s attempt to overthrow Nimeiry. In 1974, Gaddafi released Abdul-Aziz Shennib, a commander under King Idris, from prison and appointed him Libyan ambassador to Jordan. Shennib had attended the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst with King Hussein of Jordan and was tasked by Gaddafi with Hussein&#x27;s assassination. Shennib instead informed Hussein of the plot and defected to Jordan. Relations with Syria also soured over the events in the Lebanese Civil War. Initially, both Libya and Syria had contributed troops to the Arab League&#x27;s peacekeeping force, although after the Syrian army attacked the Lebanese National Movement, Gaddafi openly accused Syrian President Hafez al-Assad of &quot;national treason&quot;; he was the only Arab leader to criticize Syria&#x27;s actions. In late 1972 and early 1973, Libya invaded Chad to annex the uranium-rich Aouzou Strip.

Intent on propagating Islam, in 1973 Gaddafi founded the Islamic Call Society, which had opened 132 centres across Africa within a decade. In 1973 he converted Gabonese President Omar Bongo, an action which he repeated three years later with Jean-Bédel Bokassa, president of the Central African Republic. Between 1973 and 1979, Libya provided $500 million in aid to African countries, namely to Zaire and Uganda, and founded joint-venture companies throughout the countries to aid trade and development. Gaddafi was also keen on reducing Israeli influence within Africa, using financial incentives to successfully convince eight African states to break off diplomatic relations with Israel in 1973.

A strong relationship was also established between Gaddafi&#x27;s Libya and Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto&#x27;s Pakistani government, with the two countries exchanging nuclear research and military assistance. In recognition of Gaddafi&#x27;s support of Pakistan&#x27;s right to pursue nuclear weapons and financial support for the &quot;Islamic bomb,&quot; Lahore Stadium was renamed Gaddafi Stadium. Gaddafi also provided support for Pakistan in the Bangladesh Liberation War; he reportedly deployed F-5s to Sargodha AFB and penned a strongly worded letter to Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi accusing her of aggression against Pakistan. Gaddafi&#x27;s strong relationship with Pakistan ended after Bhutto was deposed by Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq in 1977 as Zia distrusted Gaddafi and rejected further Libyan financing for the Pakistani nuclear program in favor of Saudi financing.

Gaddafi sought to develop closer links in the Maghreb; in January 1974 Libya and Tunisia announced a political union, the Arab Islamic Republic. Although advocated by Gaddafi and Tunisian President Habib Bourguiba, the move was deeply unpopular in Tunisia, and it was soon abandoned. Retaliating, Gaddafi sponsored anti-government militants in Tunisia into the 1980s. Turning his attention to Algeria, in 1975 Libya signed, in Hassi Messaoud, a defensive alliance allegedly to counter alleged &quot;Moroccan expansionism&quot;, also funding the Polisario Front of Western Sahara in its independence struggle against Morocco. Seeking to diversify Libya&#x27;s economy, Gaddafi&#x27;s government began purchasing shares in major European corporations like Fiat as well as buying real estate in Malta and Italy, which would become a valuable source of income during the 1980s oil slump.

==Great Socialist People&#x27;s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya==

===Foundation: 1977===

On 2 March 1977, the General People&#x27;s Congress adopted the &quot;Declaration on the Establishment of the Authority of the People&quot; at Gaddafi&#x27;s behest. Dissolving the Libyan Arab Republic, it was replaced by the Great Socialist People&#x27;s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya (, &quot;)&quot;, a &quot;state of the masses&quot; conceptualized by Gaddafi. A new, all-green banner was adopted as the country&#x27;s flag. Officially, the &quot;Jamahiriya&quot; was a direct democracy in which the people ruled themselves through the 187 Basic People&#x27;s Congresses (BPCs), where all adult Libyans participated and voted on national decisions. These then sent members to the annual General People&#x27;s Congress, which was broadcast live on television. In principle, the People&#x27;s Congresses were Libya&#x27;s highest authority, with major decisions proposed by government officials or with Gaddafi himself requiring the consent of the People&#x27;s Congresses. Gaddafi became General Secretary of the GPC, although he stepped down from this position in early 1979 and appointed himself &quot;Leader of the Revolution&quot;.

Although all political control was officially vested in the People&#x27;s Congresses, in reality Libya&#x27;s existing political leadership continued to exercise varying degrees of power and influence. Debate remained limited, and major decisions regarding the economy and defence were avoided or dealt with cursorily; the GPC largely remained &quot;a rubber stamp&quot; for Gaddafi&#x27;s policies. On rare occasions, the GPC opposed Gaddafi&#x27;s suggestions, sometimes successfully; notably, when Gaddafi called on primary schools to be abolished, believing that homeschooling was healthier for children, the GPC rejected the idea. In other instances, Gaddafi pushed through laws without the GPC&#x27;s support, such as when he desired to allow women into the armed forces. At other times, he ordered snap elections when it appeared that the GPC would enact laws he opposed. Gaddafi proclaimed that the People&#x27;s Congresses provided for Libya&#x27;s every political need, rendering other political organizations unnecessary; all non-authorized groups, including political parties, professional associations, independent trade unions, and women&#x27;s groups, were banned. Despite these restrictions, St. John noted that the &quot;Jamahiriya&quot; system still &quot;introduced a level of representation and participation hitherto unknown in Libya&quot;.

With preceding legal institutions abolished, Gaddafi envisioned the &quot;Jamahiriya&quot; as following the Qur&#x27;an for legal guidance, adopting &quot;sharia&quot; law; he proclaimed &quot;man-made&quot; laws unnatural and dictatorial, only permitting Allah&#x27;s law. Within a year he was backtracking, announcing that &quot;sharia&quot; was inappropriate for the &quot;Jamahiriya&quot; because it guaranteed the protection of private property, contravening &quot;The Green Book&quot; socialism. His emphasis on placing his own work on a par with the Qur&#x27;an led conservative clerics to accuse him of &quot;shirk&quot;, furthering their opposition to his regime. In July 1977, a border war broke out with Egypt, in which the Egyptians defeated Libya despite their technological inferiority. The conflict lasted one week before both sides agreed to sign a peace treaty that was brokered by several Arab states. Both Egypt and Sudan had aligned themselves with the US, and this pushed Libya into a strategic, although not political, alignment with the Soviet Union. In recognition of the growing commercial relationship between Libya and the Soviets, Gaddafi was invited to visit Moscow in December 1976; there, he entered talks with Leonid Brezhnev. In August 1977, he visited Yugoslavia, where he met its leader Josip Broz Tito, with whom he had a much warmer relationship. He also enjoyed a warm relationship with Romanian leader Nicolae Ceaușescu. According to Romanian spy chief Ion Mihai Pacepa, Gaddafi once exclaimed to Ceaușescu, &quot;My brother! You are my brother for the rest of my life!&quot; After Pacepa defected to the US in July 1978, Gaddafi and Yasser Arafat contributed $1 million each to Ceaușescu&#x27;s $4 million bounty on Pacepa.

===Revolutionary Committees and furthering socialism: 1978–1980===

In December 1978, Gaddafi stepped down as Secretary-General of the GPC, announcing his new focus on revolutionary rather than government activities; this was part of his new emphasis on separating the apparatus of the revolution from government. Although no longer in a formal government post, he adopted the title of &quot;Leader of the Revolution&quot; and continued as commander-in-chief of the armed forces. Historian Dirk Vandewalle stated that despite the Jamahariya&#x27;s claims to being a direct democracy, Libya remained &quot;an exclusionary political system whose decision-making process&quot; was &quot;restricted to a small cadre of advisers and confidantes&quot; surrounding Gaddafi.

Libya turned towards socialism. In March 1978, the government issued guidelines for housing redistribution, attempting to ensure every adult owned their own home. Most families were banned from owning more than one house, while former rental properties were expropriated by the state and sold to the tenants at a heavily subsidized price. In September, Gaddafi called for the People&#x27;s Committees to eliminate the &quot;bureaucracy of the public sector&quot; and the &quot;dictatorship of the private sector&quot;; the People&#x27;s Committees took control of several hundred companies, converting them into worker cooperatives run by elected representatives.

In March 1979, the GPC announced the separation of government and revolution, the latter being represented by new Revolutionary Committees, who operated with the People&#x27;s Committees in schools, universities, unions, the police force, and the military. Dominated by revolutionary zealots, mostly youths, the Revolutionary Committees were based in Tripoli and met with Gaddafi annually. Membership was drawn from within the BPCs. The revolutionary committee system became &quot;a key—if not the main—mechanism through which [Gaddafi] exercises political control in Libya&quot;. Publishing a weekly magazine, &quot;The Green March&quot;, starting October 1980 they took control of the press. Responsible for perpetuating the revolution, they performed ideological surveillance, adopting a significant security role, making arrests and putting people on trial according to the &quot;law of the revolution&quot;. With no legal or safeguards, the administration of revolutionary justice was largely arbitrary and resulted in widespread abuse and the suppression of civil liberties: the &quot;Green Terror&quot;.

In 1979, the committees began the redistribution of land in the Jefara plain, continuing through 1981. In May 1980, measures to redistribute and equalize wealth were implemented; anyone with over 1000 dinar in their bank account saw that extra money expropriated. The following year, the GPC announced that the government would take control of all import, export and distribution functions, with state supermarkets replacing privately owned businesses; this led to a decline in the availability of consumer goods and the development of a thriving black market. Gaddafi was frustrated by the slow pace of social reform on women&#x27;s issues, and in 1979 launched a Revolutionary Women&#x27;s Formation, to replace the more gradualist Libyan General Women&#x27;s Federation. In 1978 he had established a Women&#x27;s Military Academy in Tripoli, encouraging all women to enlist for training. The measure was hugely controversial and voted down by the GPC in February 1983. Gaddafi remained adamant, and when it was again voted down by the GPC in March 1984, he refused to abide by the decision, declaring that &quot;he who opposes the training and emancipation of women is an agent of imperialism, whether he likes it or not.&quot;

The Jamahiriya&#x27;s radical direction earned the government many enemies. Most internal opposition came from Islamic fundamentalists, inspired by the events of the 1979 Iranian Revolution. In February 1978, Gaddafi discovered that his head of military intelligence was plotting to kill him and increasingly entrusted security to his Qadhadfa tribe. Many who had seen their wealth confiscated turned against the administration, and Western-funded opposition groups were founded by exiles. Most prominent was the National Front for the Salvation of Libya (NFSL), which orchestrated militant attacks against Libya&#x27;s government. Another, al-Borkan, began killing Libyan diplomats abroad. Following Gaddafi&#x27;s command to kill these &quot;stray dogs&quot;, the Revolutionary Committees set up overseas branches to suppress counter-revolutionary activity, assassinating dissidents. Although Syria and Israel also employed hit squads, Gaddafi was unusual in publicly bragging about his use of them; in April 1980, he ordered all dissidents to return home by 10 June or be &quot;liquidated wherever you are&quot;. Within a three months period in 1980, at least ten Libyan dissidents were murdered in Europe, including ex-diplomats, ex-army officers, businessmen, journalists, and student activists in disparate locations such as London, Greece and Austria. At least eleven more were assassinated in 1981. In 1984, Gaddafi was tricked by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak into announcing the assassination of former Libyan Prime Minister Abdul Hamid al-Bakkoush in Cairo; Bakkhoush not only turned up alive but held a press conference with Egypt&#x27;s Interior Minister. In 1979, Gaddafi created the Islamic Legion, through which several thousand Africans were military trained.

Libya had sought to improve US relations under President Jimmy Carter, for instance by courting his brother, businessman Billy Carter, and paying for the services of former CIA officers, but in 1979 the US placed Libya on its list of &quot;State Sponsors of Terrorism&quot;. Relations were further damaged when a demonstration torched the US embassy in solidarity with the perpetrators of the Iran hostage crisis. Libyan fighters began intercepting US fighter jets flying over the Mediterranean, signalling the collapse of relations between the countries. Italian media have alleged that the Itavia Flight 870 was shot down during a dogfight involving Libyan, United States, French and Italian Air Force fighters in an assassination attempt by NATO members on a Libyan politician, perhaps even Gaddafi, flying in the same airspace.

Libyan relations with Lebanon and Shi&#x27;ite communities deteriorated due to the 1978 disappearance of Imam Musa al-Sadr when visiting Libya; the Lebanese accused Gaddafi of having him killed or imprisoned, a charge he denied. Relations with Pakistan broke down in this period. Despite Gaddafi&#x27;s repeated appeals to Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq to spare Zulfikar Ali Bhutto&#x27;s life, Bhutto was executed in 1979. In retaliation and for Zia&#x27;s refusal to share Pakistan&#x27;s nuclear technology, Gaddafi began training Al-Zulfiqar, an anti-Zia insurgency led by Bhutto&#x27;s sons Murtaza and Shahnawaz, expelled all 150,000 Pakistanis living in Libya, and provided asylum for the Bhutto family. Relations with Syria improved, as Gaddafi and Syrian President Hafez al-Assad shared an enmity with Israel and Egypt&#x27;s Sadat. In 1980, they proposed a political union, with Libya promising to pay off Syria&#x27;s £1-billion debt to the Soviet Union; although pressures led Assad to pull out, they remained allies. Another key ally was Uganda, and in 1979, during the Uganda–Tanzania War, Gaddafi sent 2,500 troops to defend President Idi Amin from Tanzanian invaders. The mission failed; 400 Libyans were killed, and Libya was forced to retreat. Gaddafi came to regret his alliance with Amin, openly criticizing him as a &quot;fascist&quot; and a &quot;show-off&quot;.

===Conflict with the US and its allies: 1981–1986===

The early 80s saw economic trouble in Libya; from 1982 to 1986, annual oil revenues dropped from $21 to $5.4 billion. Focusing on irrigation projects, 1983 saw construction start on Libya&#x27;s largest and most expensive infrastructure project, the Great Man-Made River; although designed to be finished by the end of the decade, it remained incomplete at the start of the 21st century. Military spending increased, while other administrative budgets were cut. Foreign debt rose, and austerity measures were introduced to promote self-reliance; in 1985 there was a mass deportation of foreign workers, mostly Egyptian and Tunisian. Domestic threats continued to plague Gaddafi; in May 1984, his Bab al-Azizia home was unsuccessfully attacked by a militia—linked to the NFSL or Muslim Brotherhood—and in the aftermath 5,000 dissidents were arrested. In spring 1985, members of the military tried to assassinate Gaddafi twice. The first was a plot by conservative officers to assassinate him at a villa on the outskirts of Tripoli; the second was an assault on his convoy. In November 1985, Colonel Hassan Ishkal, the third most powerful man in Libya, head of the military region of Sirte, died in a suspicious car accident. Ishkal&#x27;s death was attributed to Jalloud, Khalifa Hunaysh or Gaddafi.

Libya had long supported the FROLINAT militia in neighbouring Chad, but FROLINAT became divided over its ties to Libya in 1976. In January 1978, the anti-Libya faction within FROLINAT, led by Hissène Habré, switched sides and allied with Chadian President Félix Malloum. Meanwhile, the pro-Libya faction within FROLINAT, led by Goukouni Oueddei, renamed itself People&#x27;s Armed Forces (FAP). In December 1980, Gaddafi reinvaded Chad at the request of the FAP-controlled GUNT government to aid in the civil war; in January 1981, Gaddafi suggested a political merger. The Organisation of African Unity (OAU) rejected this and called for a Libyan withdrawal, which came in November 1981. The civil war resumed, and Libya sent troops back in.

In 1982, the GUNT government was overthrown by Habré&#x27;s forces and Oueddei fled to Libya, where Gaddafi provided him with arms to continue to guerrilla war against Habré. In November 1984, Gaddafi met with French President François Mitterrand; both agreed to withdraw from Chad. Oueddei broke with Gaddafi in 1985 due to the former&#x27;s intentions to negotiate a truce with Habré. Consequently, he was placed under house arrest by Gaddafi and allegedly arrested by Libyan police and shot in the stomach. Oueddei survived the shooting and fled to Algeria, but continued to claim he and Gaddafi enjoyed a good relationship. When Gaddafi ordered the remnant of GUNT to attack Habré in February 1986 in violation of his agreement with Mitterrand, France launched Operation Épervier, which escalated into the Toyota War. Libya suffered a humiliating defeat as it was completely expelled from Chad and its commander Khalifa Haftar captured, along with 600-700 Libyan soldiers. Gaddafi disavowed Haftar and the other prisoners; one possible contributing factor to this repudiation may have been that Gaddafi had signed an agreement to withdraw Libyan forces, and Haftar&#x27;s operations had been in violation of this. An embittered Haftar then joined the anti-Gaddafi National Front for the Salvation of Libya, became a CIA asset, and was given refuge in the US.

Many African nations were tired of Libya&#x27;s interference in their affairs; by 1980, nine African states had severed diplomatic relations, while in 1982 the OAU cancelled its scheduled conference in Tripoli to prevent Gaddafi gaining chairmanship. Some African states, such as Jerry Rawlings&#x27;s Ghana and Thomas Sankara&#x27;s Burkina Faso, had warm relations with Libya during the 1980s.

Proposing political unity with Morocco, in August 1984, Gaddafi and Moroccan monarch Hassan II signed the Oujda Treaty, forming the Arab–African Union; such a union was considered surprising due to the political differences and longstanding enmity that existed between the two. In a sign of warming relations, Gaddafi promised to stop funding the Polisario Front and Hassan II extradited former RCC member Umar Muhayshi to Libya, where he was immediately killed. But relations deteriorated, particularly due to Morocco&#x27;s friendship with the US and Israel; in August 1986, Hassan abolished the union. Angered by the snub, Gaddafi plotted with Abu Nidal to assassinate Hassan in 1987, but the plot was aborted.

In 1981, the new US president, Ronald Reagan, pursued a hardline approach to Libya, viewing it as a puppet regime of the Soviet Union. Gaddafi played up his commercial relationship with the Soviets, revisiting Moscow in 1981 and 1985, and threatening to join the Warsaw Pact. The Soviets were nevertheless cautious of Gaddafi, seeing him as an unpredictable extremist. In August 1981, the US staged military exercises in the Gulf of Sirte – an area which Libya claimed. The US shot down two Libyan Su-22 planes which were on an intercept course. Closing down Libya&#x27;s embassy in Washington, Reagan advised US companies operating in Libya to reduce Americans stationed there. In December 1981, the White House claimed Gaddafi had dispatched a hit squad to assassinate Reagan, allegedly led by Carlos the Jackal, who had been living in Libya under Gaddafi&#x27;s protection after the 1975 OPEC siege. Secretary of State Alexander Haig, Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, Counselor to the President Edwin Meese, chief of staff James Baker, and deputy chief of staff Michael Deaver were considered potential targets and given special security. US ambassador to Italy Maxwell M. Rabb, who was Jewish, was urgently recalled due to threats against his life. Gaddafi denied the allegations. Gaddafi was accused of having ties to the Lebanese Armed Revolutionary Factions, which had murdered US military attaché Charles R. Ray and Israeli diplomat Yacov Barsimantov in Paris. In March 1982, the US implemented an embargo of Libyan oil, and in January 1986 ordered all US companies to cease operating in the country, although several hundred workers remained when the Libyan government doubled their pay. In spring 1986, the US Navy again performed exercises in the Gulf of Sirte; the Libyan military retaliated, but failed as the US sank Libyan ships. Diplomatic relations also broke down with the UK, after Libyan diplomats were accused in the killing of Yvonne Fletcher, a British policewoman stationed outside their London embassy, in April 1984.

In 1980, Gaddafi hired former CIA agent Edwin P. Wilson, living in Libya as a fugitive from US justice, to plot the murder of an anti-Gaddafi Libyan graduate student at Colorado State University named Faisal Zagallai. Zagallai was shot in the head in October 1980, in Fort Collins, Colorado by a former Green Beret and associate of Wilson named Eugene Tafoya. Zagallai survived the attack and Tafoya was convicted of third-degree assault and conspiracy to commit assault. Wilson was lured back to the US and sentenced to 32 years due to his ties to Gaddafi. In 1984, Gaddafi publicly executed Al-Sadek Hamed Al-Shuwehdy, an aeronautical engineer studying in the US.

After the US accused Libya of orchestrating the 1986 Berlin discotheque bombing, in which two US soldiers died, Reagan decided to retaliate. The CIA was critical of the move, believing Syria was a greater threat and that an attack would strengthen Gaddafi&#x27;s reputation; however, Libya was recognized as a &quot;soft target&quot;. Reagan was supported by the UK, but opposed by other European allies, who argued it contravened international law. In Operation El Dorado Canyon, orchestrated on 15 April 1986, US military planes launched air-strikes, bombing military installations, killing around 100 Libyans, including civilians. One target had been Gaddafi&#x27;s home. Himself unharmed, two of Gaddafi&#x27;s sons were injured, and he claimed his adopted daughter Hanna was killed, although her existence has since been questioned. Gaddafi retreated to the desert to meditate. There were sporadic clashes between Gaddafists and army officers who wanted to overthrow the government. Although the US was condemned internationally, Reagan received a popularity boost at home. Publicly lambasting US imperialism, Gaddafi&#x27;s reputation as an anti-imperialist was strengthened domestically and across the Arab world, and, in June 1986, he ordered the names of the month to be changed in Libya.

===&quot;Revolution within a Revolution&quot;: 1987–1998===
The late 1980s saw a series of liberalizing economic reforms within Libya designed to cope with the decline in oil revenues. In May 1987, Gaddafi announced the start of the &quot;Revolution within a Revolution&quot;, which began with reforms to industry and agriculture and saw the re-opening of small business. Restrictions were placed on the activities of the Revolutionary Committees; in March 1988, their role was narrowed by the newly created Ministry for Mass Mobilization and Revolutionary Leadership to restrict their violence and judicial role, while in August 1988 Gaddafi publicly criticized them.
In March, hundreds of political prisoners were freed, with Gaddafi falsely claiming that there were no further political prisoners in Libya. In June, Libya&#x27;s government issued the Great Green Charter on Human Rights in the Era of the Masses, in which 27 articles laid out goals, rights, and guarantees to improve the situation of human rights in Libya, restricting the use of the death penalty and calling for its eventual abolition. Many of the measures suggested in the charter would be implemented the following year, although others remained inactive. Also in 1989, the government founded the Al-Gaddafi International Prize for Human Rights, to be awarded to figures from the Third World who had struggled against colonialism and imperialism; the first year&#x27;s winner was South African anti-apartheid activist Nelson Mandela. From 1994 through to 1997, the government initiated cleansing committees to root out corruption, particularly in the economic sector.

In the aftermath of the 1986 US attack, the army was purged of perceived disloyal elements, and in 1988, Gaddafi announced the creation of a popular militia to replace the army and police. In 1987, Libya began production of mustard gas at a facility in Rabta, although publicly denied it was stockpiling chemical weapons, and unsuccessfully attempted to develop nuclear weapons. The period also saw a growth in domestic Islamist opposition, formulated into groups like the Muslim Brotherhood and the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group. Several assassination attempts against Gaddafi were foiled, and in turn, 1989 saw the security forces raid mosques believed to be centres of counter-revolutionary preaching. In December 1993, former Libyan foreign minister Mansour Rashid El-Kikhia, a leader of an anti-Gaddafi coalition in exile, was abducted in Cairo. His body was not found until 2012 in a morgue that belonged to Gaddafi&#x27;s intelligence chief Abdullah Senussi.

In October 1993, elements of the increasingly marginalized army, led by officers from the powerful Warfalla tribe, initiated a failed coup in Misrata and Bani Walid allegedly with help from the National Front for the Salvation of Libya, Khalifa Haftar, and the CIA, while in September 1995, Islamists launched an insurgency in Benghazi, and in July 1996 an anti-Gaddafist football riot broke out in Tripoli. In March 1996, Haftar again briefly returned to Libya to instigate an uprising against Gaddafi in the mountains of eastern Libya. The Revolutionary Committees experienced a resurgence to combat these Islamists.

In 1989, Gaddafi was overjoyed by the foundation of the Arab Maghreb Union, uniting Libya in an economic pact with Mauritania, Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria, viewing it as beginnings of a new pan-Arab union. Gaddafi was able to recover some influence in Chad after Hissène Habré was overthrown by Idriss Déby in a Libya-sponsored coup in 1990. Déby also gave Gaddafi detailed information about CIA operations in Chad. Meanwhile, Libya stepped up its support for anti-Western militants such as the Provisional IRA, and in 1988, Pan Am Flight 103 was blown up over Lockerbie in Scotland, killing 243 passengers and 16 crew members, plus 11 people on the ground. British police investigations identified two Libyans – Abdelbaset al-Megrahi and Lamin Khalifah Fhimah – as the chief suspects, and in November 1991 issued a declaration demanding that Libya hand them over. When Gaddafi refused, citing the Montreal Convention, the United Nations (UN) imposed Resolution 748 in March 1992, initiating economic sanctions against Libya which had deep repercussions for the country&#x27;s economy. The country suffered an estimated US$900 million financial loss as a result. On 5 November 1995, US President Bill Clinton declared the US would continue to induce pressure on Libya, also recognizing that Libyan terrorists were responsible for the Lockerbie bombing. Further problems arose with the West when in January 1989, two Libyan warplanes were shot down by the US off the Libyan coast and in September 1989, UTA Flight 772 was blown up over the Ténéré desert in Niger, killing all 170 people on board (156 passengers and 14 crew members).

In 1996, Gaddafi wrote a letter to the newly elected Prime Minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman&#x27;s daughter Sheikh Hasina, pleading with her to spare the lives of her father&#x27;s assassins Syed Faruque Rahman and Khandaker Abdur Rashid. Rahman and Rashid both had business ties to Libya.

Many Arab and African states opposed the UN sanctions, with Mandela criticizing them on a visit to Gaddafi in October 1997, when he praised Libya for its work in fighting apartheid and awarded Gaddafi the Order of Good Hope. They would only be suspended in 1998 when Libya agreed to allow the extradition of the suspects to the Scottish Court in the Netherlands, in a process overseen by Mandela. As a result of the trial, Fhimah was acquitted and al-Megrahi convicted. Privately, Gaddafi maintained that he knew nothing about who perpetrated the bombing and that Libya had nothing to do with it.

===Pan-Africanism, reconciliation and privatization: 1999–2011===

====Links with Africa and conflicts in the Arab League====
During the final years of the 20th century, Gaddafi—frustrated by the failure of his pan-Arab ideals and the refusal of the Arab world to challenge the international air embargo imposed on Libya—increasingly rejected Arab nationalism in favour of pan-Africanism, emphasizing Libya&#x27;s African identity. In a 1998 interview, Gaddafi claimed that &quot;the Arab world is finished&quot; and expressed his wish for Libya to become a &quot;black country.&quot; From 1997 to 2000, Libya initiated cooperative agreements or bilateral aid arrangements with 10 African states, and in 1999 joined the Community of Sahel-Saharan States. In June 1999, Gaddafi visited Mandela in South Africa, and the following month attended the OAU summit in Algiers, calling for greater political and economic integration across the continent and advocating the foundation of a United States of Africa. He became one of the founders of the African Union (AU), initiated in July 2002 to replace the OAU. At the opening ceremonies, he called for African states to reject conditional aid from the developed world, a direct contrast to the message of South African President Thabo Mbeki. There was speculation that Gaddafi wanted to become the AU&#x27;s first chair, raising concerns within Africa that this would damage the Union&#x27;s international standing, particularly with the West.

At the third AU summit, held in Tripoli, Libya, in July 2005, Gaddafi called for greater integration, advocating a single AU passport, a common defence system, and a single currency, using the slogan: &quot;The United States of Africa is the hope.&quot; His proposal for a Union of African States, a project originally conceived by Ghana&#x27;s Kwame Nkrumah in the 1960s, was rejected at the 2001 Assembly of Heads of States and Government (AHSG) summit in Lusaka by African leaders who thought it &quot;unrealistic&quot; and &quot;utopian&quot;. In June 2005, Libya joined the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA). In March 2008 in Uganda, Gaddafi gave a speech once again urging Africa to reject foreign aid. In August 2008, Gaddafi was proclaimed &quot;King of Kings&quot; by a committee of traditional African leaders; they crowned him in February 2009, in a ceremony held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. That same month, Gaddafi was elected as the chairperson of the African Union, a position he retained for one year. In October 2010, Gaddafi apologized to African leaders for the historical enslavement of Africans by the Arab slave trade.

Meanwhile, Gaddafi continued to have testy relationships with most of his fellow Arab leaders. In the 2003 Arab League summit, Gaddafi was involved in a public verbal altercation with Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, then the Crown Prince. Gaddafi accused Saudi Arabia of having made an &quot;alliance with the devil&quot; when it invited the US to intervene in the 1991 Gulf War. Abdullah responded that Gaddafi was a &quot;liar&quot; and an &quot;agent of colonizers&quot; and threatened Gaddafi that &quot;your grave awaits you.&quot; Two weeks after the summit, Gaddafi allegedly plotted with the Emir Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani of Qatar to assassinate Abdullah. The plot was overseen by Libyan intelligence chief Moussa Koussa, Mohammed Ismail (a colonel in Gaddafi&#x27;s military intelligence), and Abdul Rahman al-Amoudi (an American citizen and founder of American Muslim Council). The assassination conspiracy was foiled by Saudi intelligence with the help of the FBI and CIA. Amoudi was sentenced to 23 years in prison in the US and stripped of his American citizenship. Ismail was arrested by Saudi Arabia, pardoned by Abdullah in 2005, and later acquired UAE citizenship due to his close ties with its ruler Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. After the failure of the assassination plot, Gaddafi continued to discuss instigating a regime change in Saudi Arabia with multiple power brokers in the Persian Gulf, including Qatar&#x27;s Foreign Minister Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, Oman&#x27;s foreign minister Yusuf bin Alawi bin Abdullah, and Kuwaiti extremist preacher Hakem al-Mutairi.

The Gaddafi–Abdullah feud came into public view again in the 2009 Arab League summit when Gaddafi accused Abdullah, who had become King of Saudi Arabia in 2005, of being created by Britain and protected by the US. Alluding to their 2003 altercation, Gaddafi taunted Abdullah for ostensibly avoiding a confrontation with him for six years and quoted Abdullah&#x27;s 2003 &quot;grave awaits you&quot; threat back at him before storming out of the meeting to visit a museum. Abdullah also left the meeting hall in anger. A Saudi official later claimed that Gaddafi and Abdullah had held a 30 minutes meeting at the sideline of the summit and that the &quot;personal problem&quot; between them was &quot;over.&quot; However, Gaddafi had given weapons and money to the Houthis to attack Saudi Arabia.

====Rebuilding links with the West====

In 1999, Libya began secret talks with the British government to normalize relations. In 2001, Gaddafi publicly condemned the September 11 attacks on the US by al-Qaeda, expressing sympathy with the victims and calling for Libyan involvement in the US-led War on Terror against militant Islamism. His government continued suppressing domestic Islamism, at the same time as Gaddafi called for the wider application of &quot;sharia&quot; law. Libya also cemented connections with China and North Korea, being visited by Chinese President Jiang Zemin in April 2002. However, relations with China became strained in May 2006 due to a visit to Tripoli by Taiwanese President Chen Shui-bian. Influenced by the events of the Iraq War, in December 2003, Libya renounced its possession of weapons of mass destruction, decommissioning its chemical and nuclear weapons programs. Relations with the US improved as a result. British Prime Minister Tony Blair visited Gaddafi in March 2004; the pair developed close personal ties. In 2003, Libya paid US$2.7 billion to the families of the victims of the Lockerbie bombing as it was the condition the US and UK had made for terminating the remaining UN sanctions. Libya continued to deny any role in the bombing. In 2009, Gaddafi attempted to strong-arm global energy companies operating in Libya to cover Libya&#x27;s settlement with the families of the victims of Lockerbie.

In 2004, Gaddafi traveled to the headquarters of the European Union (EU) in Brussels—signifying improved relations between Libya and the EU—and the EU dropped its sanctions on Libya. As a strategic player in Europe&#x27;s attempts to stem illegal migration from Africa, in October 2010, the EU paid Libya over €50 million to stop African migrants passing into Europe; Gaddafi encouraged the move, saying that it was necessary to prevent the loss of European cultural identity to a new &quot;Black Europe&quot;. Gaddafi also completed agreements with the Italian government that they would invest in various infrastructure projects as reparations for past Italian colonial policies in Libya. Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi gave Libya an official apology in 2006, after which Gaddafi called him the &quot;iron man&quot; for his courage in doing so. In August 2008, Gaddafi and Berlusconi signed a historic cooperation treaty in Benghazi; under its terms, Italy would pay $5 billion to Libya as compensation for its former military occupation. In exchange, Libya would take measures to combat illegal immigration coming from its shores and boost investment in Italian companies.

After the US removed Libya from its list of state sponsors of terrorism in 2006, Gaddafi nevertheless continued his anti-Western rhetoric. At the 2008 Arab League summit, held in Syria, he warned fellow Arab leaders that they could be overthrown and executed by the US like Saddam Hussein. At the Second Africa-South America Summit, held in Venezuela in September 2009, he called for a military alliance across Africa and Latin America to rival NATO. That same month he traveled to New York City and addressed the United Nations General Assembly for the first time on 23 September 2009, using it to condemn &quot;Western aggression,&quot; and spoke for just over 90 minutes instead of the allotted 15. In the Spring of 2010, Gaddafi proclaimed &quot;jihad&quot; against Switzerland after Swiss police accused two of his family members of criminal activity in the country, resulting in the breakdown of bilateral relations.

Gaddafi allegedly financed Nicolas Sarkozy in the 2007 French presidential election. He also financed Austrian far-right politician Jörg Haider starting in 2000.

====Economic reform====
Libya&#x27;s economy witnessed increasing privatization; although rejecting the socialist policies of nationalized industry advocated in &quot;The Green Book&quot;, government figures asserted that they were forging &quot;people&#x27;s socialism&quot; rather than capitalism. Gaddafi welcomed these reforms, calling for wide-scale privatization in a March 2003 speech; he promised that Libya would join the World Trade Organization. These reforms encouraged private investment in Libya&#x27;s economy. By 2004, there was US$40 billion of direct foreign investment in Libya, a six-fold rise over 2003. Sectors of Libya&#x27;s population reacted against these reforms with public demonstrations, and in March 2006, revolutionary hard-liners took control of the GPC cabinet; although scaling back the pace of the changes, they did not halt them. In 2010, plans were announced that would have seen half the Libyan economy privatized over the following decade, these plans appear to have been soon abandoned however, as the companies that the government stated they were going to float on the stock market, among them the National Commercial Bank and the Libyan Iron and Steel Company were never floated and remained 100% state-owned. Many socialist policies remained however, with subsidiaries of logistics company HB Group being nationalized in 2007. Agriculture remained largely untouched by the reforms, with farms remaining cooperatives, the Agricultural Bank of Libya remaining wholly state-owned and state interventionist policies and price controls remaining. The oil industry remained largely state-owned, with the wholly state-owned National Oil Corporation retaining a 70% share in Libya&#x27;s oil industry, the government also imposed a 93% tax on all oil that foreign companies produced in Libya. Price controls and subsidies over oil and food remained in place, and state-provided benefits such as free education, universal healthcare, free housing, free water and free electricity remained in place. Libya also changed its stance on the WTO after the removal of technocrat Shukri Ghanem, with Gaddafi condemning the WTO as a neocolonial terrorist organisation, and urging African and Third World countries not to join it.

While there was no accompanying political liberalization, with Gaddafi retaining predominant control, in March 2010, the government devolved further powers to the municipal councils. Rising numbers of reformist technocrats attained positions in the country&#x27;s governance; best known was Gaddafi&#x27;s son and heir apparent Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, who was openly critical of Libya&#x27;s human rights record. He led a group who proposed the drafting of a new constitution, although it was never adopted. Involved in encouraging tourism, Saif founded several privately run media channels in 2008, but after criticizing the government, they were nationalized in 2009.

==Libyan Civil War and death==

===Origins and development: February–August 2011===
Following the start of the Arab Spring in 2011, Gaddafi spoke out in favour of Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, then threatened by the Tunisian Revolution. He suggested that Tunisia&#x27;s people would be satisfied if Ben Ali introduced a &quot;Jamahiriyah&quot; system there. Fearing domestic protest, Libya&#x27;s government implemented preventive measures by reducing food prices, purging the army leadership of potential defectors, and releasing several Islamist prisoners. This proved ineffective, and on 17 February 2011, major protests broke out against Gaddafi&#x27;s government. Unlike Tunisia or Egypt, Libya was largely religiously homogeneous and had no strong Islamist movement, but there was widespread dissatisfaction with the corruption and entrenched systems of patronage, while unemployment had reached around 30 percent.

Accusing the rebels of being &quot;drugged&quot; and linked to al-Qaeda, Gaddafi proclaimed that he would die a martyr rather than leave Libya. As he announced that the rebels would be &quot;hunted down street by street, house by house and wardrobe by wardrobe&quot;, the army opened fire on protesters in Benghazi, killing hundreds. Shocked at the government&#x27;s response, a number of senior politicians resigned or defected to the protesters&#x27; side. The uprising spread quickly through Libya&#x27;s less economically developed eastern half. By February&#x27;s end, eastern cities such as Benghazi, Misrata, al-Bayda, and Tobruk were controlled by rebels, and the Benghazi-based National Transitional Council (NTC) formed to represent them.

In the conflict&#x27;s early months it appeared that Gaddafi&#x27;s government—with its greater fire-power—would be victorious. Both sides disregarded the laws of war, committing human rights abuses, including arbitrary arrests, torture, extrajudicial executions, and revenge attacks. On 26 February, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1970, suspending Libya from the UN Human Rights Council, implementing sanctions and calling for an International Criminal Court (ICC) investigation into the killing of unarmed civilians. In March, the Security Council declared a no-fly zone to protect the civilian population from aerial bombardment, calling on foreign nations to enforce it; it also specifically prohibited foreign occupation. Ignoring this, Qatar sent hundreds of troops to support the dissidents and, along with France and the United Arab Emirates, provided weaponry and military training to the NTC. NATO announced that it would enforce the no-fly zone. On 30 April a NATO airstrike killed Gaddafi&#x27;s sixth son and three of his grandsons in Tripoli. This Western military intervention was criticized by various leftist governments, including those that had criticized Gaddafi&#x27;s response to the protests, because they regarded it as an imperialist attempt to secure control of Libya&#x27;s resources.

In June, the ICC issued arrest warrants for Gaddafi, his son Saif al-Islam, and his brother-in-law Abdullah Senussi, head of state security, for charges concerning crimes against humanity. That month, Amnesty International published their report, finding that Gaddafi&#x27;s forces were responsible for numerous war crimes but added that a number of allegations of human rights abuses lacked credible evidence. The report added that &quot;much Western media coverage has from the outset presented a very one-sided view of the logic of events, portraying the protest movement as entirely peaceful and repeatedly suggesting that the regime&#x27;s security forces were unaccountably massacring unarmed demonstrators&quot;. In July, over 30 governments recognized the NTC as the legitimate government of Libya; Gaddafi called on his supporters to &quot;Trample on those recognitions, trample on them under your feet ... They are worthless&quot;. In August, the Arab League recognized the NTC as &quot;the legitimate representative of the Libyan state&quot;.

Aided by NATO air cover, the rebel militia pushed westward, defeating loyalist armies and securing control of the centre of the country. Gaining the support of Amazigh (Berber) communities of the Nafusa Mountains, who had long been persecuted as non-Arabic speakers under Gaddafi, the NTC armies surrounded Gaddafi loyalists in several key areas of western Libya. In August, the rebels seized Zliten and Tripoli, ending the last vestiges of Gaddafist power. It is probable that without the NATO air strikes supporting the rebels, they would not have been able to advance west and Gaddafi&#x27;s forces would have ultimately retaken control of eastern Libya.

=== Capture and killing ===

After the fall of Tripoli, only a few towns in western Libya such as Bani Walid, Sebha, and Sirte remained Gaddafist strongholds. Gaddafi was reportedly planning to catch up with his Sebha commander Ali Kanna&#x27;s Tuareg forces and seek asylum in Burkina Faso. Instead, Gaddafi retreated to his hometown of Sirte, where he convened a meeting with his son Mutassim and intelligence chief Abdullah Senussi and learned that his youngest son Khamis had been killed by a NATO airstrike on 29 August. In the weeks that followed, Gaddafi continued to broadcast defiant audio messages through Syria-based Arrai TV. On 10 September, General Massoud Abdel Hafiz announced the formation of the Republic of Fezzan in Sebha, where Gaddafi would be president for life. Sebha fell on 22 September.

Surrounding himself with bodyguards and a small entourage, including Mutassim, security chief Mansour Dhao, and defense minister Abu-Bakr Yunis Jabr, Gaddafi continually changed residences to escape NATO and NTC shelling, devoting his days to prayer and reading the Qur&#x27;an. On 20 October, Gaddafi recorded a farewell audio message for his family, later publicized by AlHadath, and then broke out of Sirte&#x27;s District 2 in a joint civilian-military convoy. According to Dhao, it was a &quot;suicide mission&quot; as Gaddafi wanted to die in the Jarref Valley, close to where he was born. At around 08:30, NATO bombers attacked, destroying at least 14 vehicles and killing at least 53 people. The convoy scattered, and Gaddafi and those closest to him fled to a nearby villa, which was shelled by rebel militia from Misrata. Fleeing to a construction site, Gaddafi and his inner cohort hid inside drainage pipes while his bodyguards battled the rebels; in the conflict, Gaddafi suffered head injuries from a grenade blast while Jabr was killed.
The Misrata militia took Gaddafi prisoner, causing serious injuries as they tried to apprehend him; the events were filmed on a mobile phone. A video appears to picture Gaddafi being poked or stabbed in the anus &quot;with some kind of stick or knife&quot; or possibly a bayonet. Pulled onto the front of a pick-up truck, he fell off as it drove away. His semi-naked body was then placed into an ambulance and taken to Misrata; upon arrival, he was found to be dead. Official NTC accounts claimed that Gaddafi was caught in a crossfire and died from bullet wounds. Other eye-witness accounts claimed that rebels had fatally shot Gaddafi in the stomach.

That afternoon, NTC Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril publicly revealed the news of Gaddafi&#x27;s death. His corpse was placed in the freezer of a local market alongside the corpses of Yunis Jabr and Mutassim; the bodies were publicly displayed for four days, with Libyans from all over the country coming to view them. Footage of Gaddafi&#x27;s death was broadcast extensively across media networks internationally. In response to international calls, on 24 October Jibril announced that a commission would investigate Gaddafi&#x27;s death. On 25 October, the NTC announced that Gaddafi had been buried at an unidentified location in the desert.

==Political ideology==

Gaddafi&#x27;s ideological worldview was molded by his environment, namely his Islamic faith, his Bedouin upbringing, and his disgust at the actions of Italian colonialists in Libya. As a schoolboy, Gaddafi adopted the ideologies of Arab nationalism and Arab socialism, influenced in particular by Nasserism, the thought of the Egyptian President Nasser, whom Gaddafi regarded as his hero; Nasser privately described Gaddafi as &quot;a nice boy, but terribly naïve&quot;. During the early 1970s, Gaddafi formulated his own particular approach to Arab nationalism and socialism, known as Third International Theory, which &quot;The New York Times&quot; described as a combination of &quot;utopian socialism, Arab nationalism, and the Third World revolutionary theory that was in vogue at the time&quot;. In addition to Nasser, Gaddafi also cited Charles de Gaulle, Sun Yat-sen, Abraham Lincoln and Josip Broz Tito as political inspirations. He regarded this system as a practical alternative to the then-dominant international models of Western capitalism and Marxism–Leninism. He laid out the principles of this Theory in the three volumes of &quot;The Green Book&quot;, in which he sought to &quot;explain the structure of the ideal society&quot;. 

The Libyan studies specialist Ronald Bruce St. John regarded Arab nationalism as Gaddafi&#x27;s &quot;primordial value&quot;, stating that during the early years of his government, Gaddafi was &quot;the Arab nationalist par excellence&quot;. Gaddafi called for the Arab world to regain its dignity and assert a major place on the world stage, blaming Arab backwardness on stagnation resulting from Ottoman rule, European colonialism and imperialism, and corrupt and repressive monarchies. Gaddafi&#x27;s Arab nationalist views led him to the pan-Arabist belief in the need for unity across the Arab world, combining the Arab nation under a single nation-state. To this end, he had proposed a political union with five neighbouring Arab states by 1974, although without success. In keeping with his views regarding Arabs, his political stance was described as nativist. Gaddafi also had international ambitions, wanting to export his revolutionary ideas throughout the world. Gaddafi saw his socialist &quot;Jamahiriyah&quot; as a model for the Arab, Islamic, and non-aligned worlds to follow, and in his speeches declared that his Third International Theory would eventually guide the entire planet. He nevertheless had minimal success in exporting the ideology outside of Libya.

Along with Arab nationalism, anti-imperialism was also a defining feature of Gaddafi&#x27;s regime during its early years. He believed in opposing Western imperialism and colonialism in the Arab world, including any Western expansionism through the form of Israel. He offered support to a broad range of political groups abroad that called themselves &quot;anti-imperialist&quot;, especially those that set themselves in opposition to the United States. For many years, anti-Zionism was a fundamental component of Gaddafi&#x27;s ideology. He believed that the state of Israel should not exist and that any Arab compromise with the Israeli government was a betrayal of the Arab people. In large part due to their support of Israel, Gaddafi despised the United States, considering the country to be imperialist and lambasting it as &quot;the embodiment of evil&quot;. He sought to distinguish &quot;oriental&quot; Jews who had lived in the Middle East for generations from the European Jews who had migrated to Palestine during the 20th century, calling the latter &quot;vagabonds&quot; and &quot;mercenaries&quot; who should return to Europe. He rallied against Jews in many of his speeches, with Blundy and Lycett claiming that his antisemitism was &quot;almost Hitlerian&quot;. As Pan-Africanism increasingly became his focus in the early 21st century, Gaddafi became less interested in the Israel-Palestine issue, calling for the two communities to form a new single-state that he termed &quot;Isratin&quot;. This would have led the Jewish population to become a minority within the new state.

===Islamic modernism and Islamic socialism===

Gaddafi rejected the secularist approach to Arab nationalism that had been pervasive in Syria, with his revolutionary movement placing a far stronger emphasis on Islam than previous Arab nationalist movements had done. He deemed Arabism and Islam to be inseparable, referring to them as &quot;one and indivisible&quot;, and called on the Arab world&#x27;s Christian minority to convert to Islam. He insisted that Islamic law should be the basis for the law of the state, blurring any distinction between the religious and secular realms. He desired unity across the Islamic world, and encouraged the propagation of the faith elsewhere; on a 2010 visit to Italy, he paid a modelling agency to find 200 young Italian women for a lecture he gave urging them to convert. According to the Gaddafi biographer Jonathan Bearman, in Islamic terms Gaddafi was a modernist rather than a fundamentalist, for he subordinated religion to the political system rather than seeking to Islamicise the state as Islamists sought to do. He was driven by a sense of &quot;divine mission&quot;, believing himself a conduit of God&#x27;s will, and thought that he must achieve his goals &quot;no matter what the cost&quot;. His interpretation of Islam was nevertheless idiosyncratic, and he clashed with conservative Libyan clerics. Many criticized his attempts to encourage women to enter traditionally male-only sectors of society, such as the armed forces. Gaddafi was keen to improve women&#x27;s status, although saw the sexes as &quot;separate but equal&quot; and therefore felt women should usually remain in traditional roles.

Gaddafi described his approach to economics as &quot;Islamic socialism&quot;. For him, a socialist society could be defined as one in which men controlled their own needs, either through personal ownership or through a collective. Although the early policies pursued by his government were state capitalist in orientation, by 1978 he believed that private ownership of the means of production was exploitative and thus he sought to move Libya away from capitalism and towards socialism. Private enterprise was largely eliminated in favour of a centrally controlled economy. The extent to which Libya became socialist under Gaddafi is disputed. Bearman suggested that while Libya did undergo &quot;a profound social revolution&quot;, he did not think that &quot;a socialist society&quot; was established in Libya. Conversely, St. John expressed the view that &quot;if socialism is defined as a redistribution of wealth and resources, a socialist revolution clearly occurred in Libya&quot; under Gaddafi&#x27;s regime.

Gaddafi was staunchly anti-Marxist, and in 1973 declared that &quot;it is the duty of every Muslim to combat&quot; Marxism because it promotes atheism. In his view, ideologies like Marxism and Zionism were alien to the Islamic world and were a threat to the ummah, or global Islamic community. Nevertheless, Blundy and Lycett noted that Gaddafi&#x27;s socialism had a &quot;curiously Marxist undertone&quot;, with political scientist Sami Hajjar arguing that Gaddafi&#x27;s model of socialism offered a simplification of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels&#x27;s theories. While acknowledging the Marxist influence on Gaddafi&#x27;s thought, Bearman stated that the Libyan leader rejected Marxism&#x27;s core tenet, that of class struggle as the main engine of social development. Instead of embracing the Marxist idea that a socialist society emerged from class struggle between the proletariat and bourgeoisie, Gaddafi believed that socialism would be achieved through overturning &quot;unnatural&quot; capitalism and returning society to its &quot;natural equilibrium&quot;. In this, he sought to replace a capitalist economy with one based on his own romanticized ideas of a traditional, pre-capitalist past. This owed much to the Islamic belief in God&#x27;s natural law providing order to the universe.

==Personal life==

A very private individual, Gaddafi was given to rumination and solitude and could be reclusive. Gaddafi described himself as a &quot;simple revolutionary&quot; and &quot;pious Muslim&quot; called upon by God to continue Nasser&#x27;s work. Gaddafi was an austere and devout Muslim, although according to Vandewalle, his interpretation of Islam was &quot;deeply personal and idiosyncratic.&quot; He was also a football enthusiast and enjoyed both playing the sport and horse riding as a means of recreation. He regarded himself as an intellectual; he was a fan of Beethoven and said his favourite novels were &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;The Outsider&quot;.

Gaddafi regarded personal appearance as important, with Blundy and Lycett referring to him as &quot;extraordinarily vain.&quot; Gaddafi had a large wardrobe, and sometimes changed his outfit multiple times a day. He favoured either a military uniform or traditional Libyan dress, tending to eschew Western-style suits. He saw himself as a fashion icon, stating &quot;Whatever I wear becomes a fad. I wear a certain shirt and suddenly everyone is wearing it.&quot; Following his ascension to power, Gaddafi moved into the Bab al-Azizia barracks, a 6-square-kilometre (2.3 square miles) fortified compound located 3.2 kilometres (2 miles) from the centre of Tripoli. In the 1980s, his lifestyle was considered modest in comparison to those of many other Arab leaders.

He was preoccupied with his own security, regularly changing where he slept and sometimes grounding all other planes in Libya when he was flying. He made particular requests when travelling to foreign countries. During his trips to Rome, Paris, Madrid, Moscow, and New York City, he resided in a bulletproof tent, following his Bedouin traditions. Gaddafi was notably confrontational in his approach to foreign powers and generally shunned Western ambassadors and diplomats, believing them to be spies.

In the 1970s and 1980s, there were reports of his making sexual advances toward female reporters and members of his entourage. Starting in the 1980s, he travelled with his all-female Amazonian Guard, who were allegedly sworn to a life of celibacy. After Gaddafi&#x27;s death, the Libyan psychologist Seham Sergewa, part of a team investigating sexual offences during the civil war, stated that five of the guards told her they had been raped by Gaddafi and senior officials. After Gaddafi&#x27;s death, the French journalist published a book alleging that Gaddafi had had sexual relations with women, some in their early teenage years, who had been specially selected for him. One of those Cojean interviewed, a woman named Soraya, claimed that Gaddafi kept her imprisoned in a basement for six years, where he repeatedly raped her, urinated on her, and forced her to watch pornography, drink alcohol, and snort cocaine. The alleged sexual abuse was said to have been facilitated by Gaddafi&#x27;s Chief of Protocol Nuri al-Mismari and Mabrouka Sherif. Gaddafi also hired several Ukrainian nurses to care for him; one described him as kind and considerate and was surprised that allegations of abuse had been made against him.
Gaddafi married his first wife, Fatiha al-Nuri, in 1969. Although they had one son, Muhammad Gaddafi (born 1970), their relationship was strained, and they divorced in 1970. Gaddafi&#x27;s second wife was Safia Farkash, née el-Brasai, a former nurse from the Obeidat tribe born in Bayda. They met in 1969, following his ascension to power, when he was hospitalized with appendicitis; he claimed that it was love at first sight. The couple remained married until his death. Together they had seven biological children: Saif al-Islam Gaddafi (born 1972), Al-Saadi Gaddafi (born 1973), Mutassim Gaddafi (1974–2011), Hannibal Muammar Gaddafi (born 1975), Ayesha Gaddafi (born 1976), Saif al-Arab Gaddafi (1982–2011), and Khamis Gaddafi (1983–2011). He also adopted two children, Hana Gaddafi and Milad Gaddafi. Several of his sons gained a reputation for lavish and anti-social behaviour in Libya, which proved a source of resentment toward his administration. At least three of his cousins were prominent figures in Gaddafi&#x27;s regime. Ahmed Gaddaf al-Dam is Libya&#x27;s former Special Envoy to Egypt and a leading figure of the Gaddafi regime. Mansour Dhao was his chief of security and led the People&#x27;s Guard. Sayyid Gaddaf al-Dam was a brigadier general and described as the second most powerful person in Libya in the 1980s.

==Public life==

According to Vandewalle, Gaddafi &quot;dominated [Libya&#x27;s] political life&quot; during his period in power. The sociologist Raymond A. Hinnebusch described the Libyan as &quot;perhaps the most exemplary contemporary case of the politics of charismatic leadership&quot;, displaying all of the traits of charismatic authority outlined by the sociologist Max Weber. According to Hinnebusch, the foundations of Gaddafi&#x27;s &quot;personal charismatic authority&quot; in Libya stemmed from the blessing he had received from Nasser coupled with &quot;nationalist achievements&quot; such as the expulsion of foreign military bases, the extraction of higher prices for Libyan oil, and his vocal support for the Palestinian and other anti-imperialist causes.

A cult of personality devoted to Gaddafi existed in Libya through most of his rule. His biographer Alison Pargeter noted that &quot;he filled every space, moulding the entire country around himself.&quot; Depictions of his face could be found throughout the country, including on postage stamps, watches, and school satchels. Quotations from &quot;The Green Book&quot; appeared on a wide variety of places, from street walls to airports and pens, and were put to pop music for public release. In private, Gaddafi often complained that he disliked this personality cult surrounding him, but that he tolerated it because the people of Libya adored him. The cult served a political purpose, with Gaddafi helping to provide a central identity for the Libyan state.

Several biographers and observers characterized Gaddafi as a populist. He enjoyed attending lengthy public sessions where people were invited to question him; these were often televised. Throughout Libya, crowds of supporters would arrive at public events where he appeared. Described as &quot;spontaneous demonstrations&quot; by the government, there are recorded instances of groups being coerced or paid to attend. He was typically late to public events, and would sometimes fail to arrive. Although Bianco thought he had a &quot;gift for oratory&quot;, he was considered a poor orator by Blundy and Lycett. The biographer Daniel Kawczynski noted that Gaddafi was famed for his &quot;lengthy, wandering&quot; speeches, which typically involved criticizing Israel and the US. The journalist Ruth First described his speeches as being &quot;an inexhaustible flow; didactic, at times incoherent; peppered with snatches of half-formed opinions; admonitions; confidences; some sound common sense, and as much prejudice&quot;.

==Awards and honours==
==Reception and legacy==
Supporters praised Gaddafi&#x27;s administration for the creation of a more equal society through domestic reform. They stressed the regime&#x27;s achievements in combating homelessness, ensuring access to food and safe drinking water, and to dramatic improvements in education. Supporters have also applauded achievements in medical care, praising the universal free healthcare provided under the Gaddafist administration, with diseases like cholera and typhoid being contained and life expectancy raised.

Gaddafi&#x27;s government&#x27;s treatment of non-Arab Libyans came in for criticism from human rights activists, with native Berbers, Italian colonists, Jews, refugees, and foreign workers all facing persecution in Gaddafist Libya. Human rights groups also criticized the treatment of migrants, including asylum seekers, who passed through Gaddafi&#x27;s Libya on their way to Europe. During the Civil War, various leftist groups endorsed the anti-Gaddafist rebels—but not the Western military intervention—by arguing that Gaddafi had become an ally of Western imperialism by cooperating with the War on Terror and efforts to block African migration to Europe. Gaddafi was widely perceived as a terrorist, especially in the US and UK.

===Posthumous assessment===
International reactions to Gaddafi&#x27;s death were divided. Gaddafi was mourned as a hero by many across sub-Saharan Africa but was widely condemned elsewhere.

Following his defeat in the civil war, Gaddafi&#x27;s system of governance was dismantled and replaced by the interim government of the NTC, which legalized trade unions and freedom of the press. In January 2013, the GNC officially renamed the &quot;Jamahiriyah&quot; as the &quot;State of Libya&quot;. Gaddafi loyalists then founded a new political party, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Libya. Led by Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, the Popular Front was allowed to participate in the future general election.

<text>The Stefan–Boltzmann law, also known as &quot;Stefan&#x27;s law&quot;, describes the intensity of the thermal radiation emitted by matter in terms of that matter&#x27;s temperature. It is named for Josef Stefan, who empirically derived the relationship, and Ludwig Boltzmann who derived the law theoretically.

For an ideal absorber/emitter or black body, the Stefan–Boltzmann law states that the total energy radiated per unit surface area per unit time (also known as the &quot;radiant exitance&quot;) is directly proportional to the fourth power of the black body&#x27;s temperature, :
formula_1

The constant of proportionality, formula_2, is called the Stefan–Boltzmann constant. It has the value
In the general case, the Stefan–Boltzmann law for radiant exitance takes the form:
formula_3
where formula_4 is the emissivity of the surface emitting the radiation. The emissivity is generally between zero and one. An emissivity of one corresponds to a black body.

== Detailed explanation ==
The &quot;radiant exitance&quot; (previously called &quot;radiant emittance&quot;), formula_5, has dimensions of energy flux (energy per unit time per unit area), and the SI units of measure are joules per second per square metre (J⋅s⋅m), or equivalently, watts per square metre (W⋅m). The SI unit for absolute temperature, , is the kelvin (K).

To find the total power, formula_6, radiated from an object, multiply the radiant exitance by the object&#x27;s surface area, formula_7:
formula_8

Matter that does not absorb all incident radiation emits less total energy than a black body. Emissions are reduced by a factor formula_4, where the emissivity, formula_4, is a material property which, for most matter, satisfies formula_11. Emissivity can in general depend on wavelength, direction, and polarization. However, the emissivity which appears in the non-directional form of the Stefan–Boltzmann law is the hemispherical total emissivity, which reflects emissions as totaled over all wavelengths, directions, and polarizations.

The form of the Stefan–Boltzmann law that includes emissivity is applicable to all matter, provided that matter is in a state of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) so that its temperature is well-defined. (This is a trivial conclusion, since the emissivity, formula_4, is defined to be the quantity that makes this equation valid. What is non-trivial is the proposition that formula_13, which is a consequence of Kirchhoff&#x27;s law of thermal radiation.)

A so-called &quot;grey body&quot; is a body for which the spectral emissivity is independent of wavelength, so that the total emissivity, formula_4, is a constant. In the more general (and realistic) case, the spectral emissivity depends on wavelength. The total emissivity, as applicable to the Stefan–Boltzmann law, may be calculated as a weighted average of the spectral emissivity, with the blackbody emission spectrum serving as the weighting function. It follows that if the spectral emissivity depends on wavelength then the total emissivity depends on the temperature, i.e., formula_15. However, if the dependence on wavelength is small, then the dependence on temperature will be small as well.

Wavelength- and subwavelength-scale particles, metamaterials, and other nanostructures are not subject to ray-optical limits and may be designed to have an emissivity greater than 1.

In national and international standards documents, the symbol formula_5 is recommended to denote &quot;radiant exitance&quot;; a superscript circle (°) indicates a term relate to a black body. (A subscript &quot;e&quot; is added when it is important to distinguish the energetic (radiometric) quantity &quot;radiant exitance&quot;, formula_17, from the analogous human vision (photometric) quantity, &quot;luminous exitance&quot;, denoted formula_18.) In common usage, the symbol used for radiant exitance (often called &quot;radiant emittance&quot;) varies among different texts and in different fields.

The &quot;Stefan–Boltzmann law&quot; may be expressed as a formula for &quot;radiance&quot; as a function of temperature. Radiance is measured in watts per square metre per steradian (W⋅m⋅sr). The Stefan–Boltzmann law for the radiance of a black body is:
formula_19

The &quot;Stefan–Boltzmann law&quot; expressed as a formula for &quot;radiation energy density&quot; is:
formula_20
where formula_21 is the speed of light.

== History ==
In 1864, John Tyndall presented measurements of the infrared emission by a platinum filament and the corresponding color of the filament.
The proportionality to the fourth power of the absolute temperature was deduced by Josef Stefan (1835–1893) in 1877 on the basis of Tyndall&#x27;s experimental measurements, in the article &quot;Über die Beziehung zwischen der Wärmestrahlung und der Temperatur&quot; (&quot;On the relationship between thermal radiation and temperature&quot;) in the &quot;Bulletins from the sessions&quot; of the Vienna Academy of Sciences.

A derivation of the law from theoretical considerations was presented by Ludwig Boltzmann (1844–1906) in 1884, drawing upon the work of Adolfo Bartoli.
Bartoli in 1876 had derived the existence of radiation pressure from the principles of thermodynamics. Following Bartoli, Boltzmann considered an ideal heat engine using electromagnetic radiation instead of an ideal gas as working matter.

The law was almost immediately experimentally verified. Heinrich Weber in 1888 pointed out deviations at higher temperatures, but perfect accuracy within measurement uncertainties was confirmed up to temperatures of 1535 K by 1897.
The law, including the theoretical prediction of the Stefan–Boltzmann constant as a function of the speed of light, the Boltzmann constant and the Planck constant, is a direct consequence of Planck&#x27;s law as formulated in 1900.

== Stefan–Boltzmann constant ==

The Stefan–Boltzmann constant, , is derived from other known physical constants:
formula_22
where is the Boltzmann constant, the is the Planck constant, and is the speed of light in vacuum.

As of the 2019 revision of the SI, which establishes exact fixed values for , , and , the Stefan–Boltzmann constant is exactly:
formula_23
Thus,
Prior to this, the value of formula_2 was calculated from the measured value of the gas constant.

The numerical value of the Stefan–Boltzmann constant is different in other systems of units, as shown in the table below.

== Examples ==
=== Temperature of the Sun ===

With his law, Stefan also determined the temperature of the Sun&#x27;s surface. He inferred from the data of Jacques-Louis Soret (1827–1890) that the energy flux density from the Sun is 29 times greater than the energy flux density of a certain warmed metal lamella (a thin plate). A round lamella was placed at such a distance from the measuring device that it would be seen at the same angular diameter as the Sun. Soret estimated the temperature of the lamella to be approximately 1900 °C to 2000 °C. Stefan surmised that 1/3 of the energy flux from the Sun is absorbed by the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, so he took for the correct Sun&#x27;s energy flux a value 3/2 times greater than Soret&#x27;s value, namely 29 × 3/2 = 43.5.

Precise measurements of atmospheric absorption were not made until 1888 and 1904. The temperature Stefan obtained was a median value of previous ones, 1950 °C and the absolute thermodynamic one 2200 K. As 2.574 = 43.5, it follows from the law that the temperature of the Sun is 2.57 times greater than the temperature of the lamella, so Stefan got a value of 5430 °C or 5700 K. This was the first sensible value for the temperature of the Sun. Before this, values ranging from as low as 1800 °C to as high as were claimed. The lower value of 1800 °C was determined by Claude Pouillet (1790–1868) in 1838 using the Dulong–Petit law. Pouillet also took just half the value of the Sun&#x27;s correct energy flux.

=== Temperature of stars ===
The temperature of stars other than the Sun can be approximated using a similar means by treating the emitted energy as a black body radiation. So:
formula_25
where is the luminosity, is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant, is the stellar radius and is the effective temperature. This formula can then be rearranged to calculate the temperature:
formula_26
or alternatively the radius:
formula_27

The same formulae can also be simplified to compute the parameters relative to the Sun:
formula_28
where formula_29 is the solar radius, and so forth. They can also be rewritten in terms of the surface area &quot;A&quot; and radiant exitance formula_30:
formula_31
where formula_32 and formula_33

With the Stefan–Boltzmann law, astronomers can easily infer the radii of stars. The law is also met in the thermodynamics of black holes in so-called Hawking radiation.

=== Effective temperature of the Earth ===
Similarly we can calculate the effective temperature of the Earth &quot;T&quot;⊕ by equating the energy received from the Sun and the energy radiated by the Earth, under the black-body approximation (Earth&#x27;s own production of energy being small enough to be negligible). The luminosity of the Sun, &quot;L&quot;⊙, is given by:
formula_34

At Earth, this energy is passing through a sphere with a radius of &quot;a&quot;0, the distance between the Earth and the Sun, and the irradiance (received power per unit area) is given by
formula_35

The Earth has a radius of &quot;R&quot;⊕, and therefore has a cross-section of formula_36. The radiant flux (i.e. solar power) absorbed by the Earth is thus given by:
formula_37

Because the Stefan–Boltzmann law uses a fourth power, it has a stabilizing effect on the exchange and the flux emitted by Earth tends to be equal to the flux absorbed, close to the steady state where:
formula_38

&quot;T&quot;⊕ can then be found:
formula_39
where &quot;T&quot;⊙ is the temperature of the Sun, &quot;R&quot;⊙ the radius of the Sun, and &quot;a&quot;0 is the distance between the Earth and the Sun. This gives an effective temperature of 6 °C on the surface of the Earth, assuming that it perfectly absorbs all emission falling on it and has no atmosphere.

The Earth has an albedo of 0.3, meaning that 30% of the solar radiation that hits the planet gets scattered back into space without absorption. The effect of albedo on temperature can be approximated by assuming that the energy absorbed is multiplied by 0.7, but that the planet still radiates as a black body (the latter by definition of effective temperature, which is what we are calculating). This approximation reduces the temperature by a factor of 0.71/4, giving .

The above temperature is Earth&#x27;s as seen from space, not ground temperature but an average over all emitting bodies of Earth from surface to high altitude. Because of the greenhouse effect, the Earth&#x27;s actual average surface temperature is about , which is higher than the effective temperature, and even higher than the temperature that a black body would have.

In the above discussion, we have assumed that the whole surface of the earth is at one temperature. Another interesting question is to ask what the temperature of a blackbody surface on the earth would be assuming that it reaches equilibrium with the sunlight falling on it. This of course depends on the angle of the sun on the surface and on how much air the sunlight has gone through. When the sun is at the zenith and the surface is horizontal, the irradiance can be as high as 1120 W/m2. The Stefan–Boltzmann law then gives a temperature of
formula_40
or . (Above the atmosphere, the result is even higher: .) We can think of the earth&#x27;s surface as &quot;trying&quot; to reach equilibrium temperature during the day, but being cooled by the atmosphere, and &quot;trying&quot; to reach equilibrium with starlight and possibly moonlight at night, but being warmed by the atmosphere.

== Origination ==

=== Thermodynamic derivation of the energy density ===
The fact that the energy density of the box containing radiation is proportional to formula_41 can be derived using thermodynamics. This derivation uses the relation between the radiation pressure &quot;p&quot; and the internal energy density formula_42, a relation that can be shown using the form of the electromagnetic stress–energy tensor. This relation is:
formula_43

Now, from the fundamental thermodynamic relation
formula_44
we obtain the following expression, after dividing by formula_45 and fixing formula_46:
formula_47

The last equality comes from the following Maxwell relation:
formula_48

From the definition of energy density it follows that
formula_49
where the energy density of radiation only depends on the temperature, therefore
formula_50

Now, the equality is
formula_51 after substitution of formula_52

Meanwhile, the pressure is the rate of momentum change per unit area. Since the momentum of a photon is the same as the energy divided by the speed of light,
formula_53
where the factor 1/3 comes from the projection of the momentum transfer onto the normal to the wall of the container.

Since the partial derivative formula_54 can be expressed as a relationship between only formula_55 and formula_46 (if one isolates it on one side of the equality), the partial derivative can be replaced by the ordinary derivative. After separating the differentials the equality becomes
formula_57
which leads immediately to formula_58, with formula_59 as some constant of integration.

=== Derivation from Planck&#x27;s law ===

The law can be derived by considering a small flat black body surface radiating out into a half-sphere. This derivation uses spherical coordinates, with &quot;θ&quot; as the zenith angle and &quot;φ&quot; as the azimuthal angle; and the small flat blackbody surface lies on the xy-plane, where &quot;θ&quot; = /2.

The intensity of the light emitted from the blackbody surface is given by Planck&#x27;s law,
formula_60
where
* formula_61 is the amount of power per unit surface area per unit solid angle per unit frequency emitted at a frequency formula_62 by a black body at temperature &quot;T&quot;.
* formula_63 is the Planck constant
* formula_64 is the speed of light, and
* formula_65 is the Boltzmann constant.

The quantity formula_66 is the power radiated by a surface of area A through a solid angle in the frequency range between and .

The Stefan–Boltzmann law gives the power emitted per unit area of the emitting body,
formula_67
Note that the cosine appears because black bodies are &quot;Lambertian&quot; (i.e. they obey Lambert&#x27;s cosine law), meaning that the intensity observed along the sphere will be the actual intensity times the cosine of the zenith angle.
To derive the Stefan–Boltzmann law, we must integrate formula_68 over the half-sphere and integrate formula_69 from 0 to ∞.

formula_70

Then we plug in for &quot;I&quot;:
formula_71

To evaluate this integral, do a substitution,
formula_72
which gives:
formula_73

The integral on the right is standard and goes by many names: it is a particular case of a Bose–Einstein integral, the polylogarithm, or the Riemann zeta function formula_74. The value of the integral is formula_75 (where formula_76 is the Gamma function), giving the result that, for a perfect blackbody surface:
formula_77

Finally, this proof started out only considering a small flat surface. However, any differentiable surface can be approximated by a collection of small flat surfaces. So long as the geometry of the surface does not cause the blackbody to reabsorb its own radiation, the total energy radiated is just the sum of the energies radiated by each surface; and the total surface area is just the sum of the areas of each surface—so this law holds for all convex blackbodies, too, so long as the surface has the same temperature throughout. The law extends to radiation from non-convex bodies by using the fact that the convex hull of a black body radiates as though it were itself a black body.

=== Energy density ===
The total energy density &quot;U&quot; can be similarly calculated, except the integration is over the whole sphere and there is no cosine, and the energy flux (U c) should be divided by the velocity &quot;c&quot; to give the energy density &quot;U&quot;:
formula_78
Thus formula_79 is replaced by formula_80, giving an extra factor of 4.

Thus, in total:
formula_81
The product formula_82 is sometimes known as the radiation constant or radiation density constant.

== Decomposition in terms of photons ==
The Stefan–Boltzmann law can be expressed as
formula_83
where the flux of photons, formula_84, is given by
formula_85
formula_86
and the average energy per photon,formula_87, is given by
formula_88

Marr and Wilkin (2012) recommend that students be taught about formula_87 instead of being taught Wien&#x27;s displacement law, and that the above decomposition be taught when the Stefan–Boltzmann law is taught.

<text>Josef Stefan (; 24 March 1835 – 7 January 1893) was a Carinthian Slovene physicist, mathematician, and poet of the Austrian Empire.

== Life and work ==
Stefan was born in the village of St. Peter (Slovene: ) on the outskirts of Klagenfurt) to Aleš (Aleksander) Stefan (1805-1872) and Marija Startinik (1815-1863). His parents, both ethnic Slovenes, did not marry until Josef was eleven. The Stefans were of modest means; his father was a milling assistant and his mother served as a maidservant. Josef was their only child.

Stefan attended elementary school in Klagenfurt, where he showed talent, and was recommended for enrollment at the in 1845. At thirteen, he experienced the revolutionary year of 1848, which inspired him to show sympathy toward the Slovene literary and national movement.

After having graduated top of his class in high school, he briefly considered joining the Benedictine Order, but his great interest in physics prevailed. He left for Vienna in 1853 to study mathematics and physics. His professor of physics in the gymnasium was Karel Robida, who wrote the first Slovene physics textbook. Stefan then earned his habilitation in mathematical physics at the University of Vienna in 1858. During his student years, he also wrote and published a number of poems in Slovene.

Stefan taught physics at the University of Vienna, was Director of the Physical Institute from 1866, Vice-President of the Vienna Academy of Sciences, and member of several scientific institutions in Europe. He died in Vienna, Austria-Hungary. His life and work were extensively documented by the physicist Janez Strnad.

==Work==
Stefan published nearly 80 scientific articles, mostly in the Bulletins of the Vienna Academy of Sciences. He is best known for originating Stefan&#x27;s law in 1879, a physical power law stating that the total radiation from a black body is proportional to the fourth power of its thermodynamic temperature &quot;T&quot;:

:formula_1

He derived this law from the measurements of the French physicists Dulong and Petit. As both incident radiation and blackbody emission are always equal, this equation applies equally to the temperature of any ideal body subject to incident radiation across its surface. In 1884, the law was extended to apply to grey-body emissions by Stefan&#x27;s student Ludwig Boltzmann and hence is known as Stefan–Boltzmann law. Boltzmann treated a heat engine with light as a working matter. This law is the only physical law of nature named after a Slovene physicist. Today, the law is derived from Planck&#x27;s law of black-body radiation:

:formula_2

With his law, Stefan determined the temperature of the Sun&#x27;s surface, which he calculated to be . This was the first sensible value for the temperature of the Sun.

Stefan provided the first measurements of the thermal conductivity of gases, treated evaporation, and among others studied diffusion, heat conduction in fluids. For his treatise on optics, the University of Vienna bestowed the Lieben Prize on him. Because of his early work in calculating evaporation and diffusion rates, flow from a droplet or particle that is induced by evaporation or sublimation at the surface is now called the Stefan flow.

Very important are also his electromagnetic equations, defined in vector notation, and works in the kinetic theory of heat. Stefan was among the first physicists in Europe who fully understood Maxwell&#x27;s electromagnetic theory and one of the few outside England who expanded on it. He calculated inductivity of a coil with a quadratic cross-section, and he corrected Maxwell&#x27;s miscalculation. He also researched a phenomenon called the skin effect, where high-frequency electric current is greater on the surface of a conductor than in its interior.

In mathematics, the Stefan problems or Stefan&#x27;s tasks with movable boundary are well known. The problem was first studied by Lamé and Clapeyron in 1831. Stefan solved the problem when he was calculating how quickly a layer of ice on water grows (Stefan&#x27;s equation).

== Eponymous terms ==

Several concepts in physics and mathematics are named after Joseph Stefan:
* Stefan–Boltzmann law
* Stefan–Boltzmann constant σ
* Stefan adhesion
* Stefan problem
* Stefan&#x27;s equation
* Stefan&#x27;s formula
* Stefan flow
* Stefan number
* Stefan tube
* Maxwell–Stefan diffusion

The Jožef Stefan Institute, Slovenia&#x27;s premier scientific establishment, is also named after him, and also:
* Stefan (crater) on the Moon

<text>WebCrawler is a search engine, and one of the oldest surviving search engines on the web today. For many years, it operated as a metasearch engine. WebCrawler was the first web search engine to provide full text search.

==History==

Brian Pinkerton first started working on WebCrawler, which was originally a desktop application, on January 27, 1994 at the University of Washington. On March 15, 1994, he generated a list of the top 25 websites.

WebCrawler launched on April 21, 1994, with more than 4,000 different websites in its database and on November 14, 1994, WebCrawler served its 1 millionth search query for &quot;nuclear weapons design and research&quot;.

On December 1, 1994, WebCrawler acquired two sponsors, DealerNet and Starwave, which provided money to keep WebCrawler operating. Starting on October 3, 1995, WebCrawler was fully supported by advertising, but separated the adverts from search results.

On June 1, 1995, America Online (AOL) acquired WebCrawler. After being acquired by AOL, the website introduced its mascot &quot;Spidey&quot; on September 1, 1995.

Starting in April 1996, WebCrawler also included the human-edited internet guide GNN Select, which was also under AOL ownership.

On April 1, 1997, Excite acquired WebCrawler from AOL for $12.3 million.

WebCrawler received a redesign on June 16, 1997, adding WebCrawler Shortcuts, which suggested alternative links to material related to a search topic.

WebCrawler was maintained by Excite as a separate search engine with its own database until 2001, when it started using Excite&#x27;s own database, effectively putting an end to WebCrawler as an independent search engine. Later that year, Excite (then called Excite@Home) went bankrupt and WebCrawler was bought by InfoSpace in 2001.
Pinkerton, WebCrawler&#x27;s creator, led the Amazon A9.com search division as of 2012.

In July 2016, InfoSpace was sold by parent company Blucora to OpenMail for $45 million, putting WebCrawler under the ownership of OpenMail. OpenMail was later renamed System1.

In 2018, WebCrawler was redesigned from scratch and its logo was changed.

== Traffic ==

WebCrawler was highly successful early on. At one point, it was unusable during peak times due to server overload. It was the second most visited website on the internet in February 1996, but it quickly dropped below rival search engines and directories such as Yahoo!, Infoseek, Lycos, and Excite in 1997.

<doc id="53036" wikidata="Q11182" url="?curid=53036" title="Network address translation">
<text>Network address translation (NAT) is a method of mapping an IP address space into another by modifying network address information in the IP header of packets while they are in transit across a traffic routing device. The technique was initially used to bypass the need to assign a new address to every host when a network was moved, or when the upstream Internet service provider was replaced but could not route the network&#x27;s address space. It has become a popular and essential tool in conserving global address space in the face of IPv4 address exhaustion. One Internet-routable IP address of a NAT gateway can be used for an entire private network.

As network address translation modifies the IP address information in packets, NAT implementations may vary in their specific behavior in various addressing cases and their effect on network traffic. Vendors of equipment containing NAT implementations do not commonly document the specifics of NAT behavior.

== History ==
Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) uses 32-bit addresses, capable of uniquely addressing about 4.3 billion devices on the network. By 1992, it became evident that that would not be enough. The 1994 describes NAT as a &quot;short-term solution&quot; to the two most compelling problems facing the Internet Protocol at that time: IP address depletion and scaling in routing. By 2004, NAT had become widespread.

The technique also became known as IP masquerading. which suggests a technique that hides an entire IP address space, usually consisting of private IP addresses, behind a single IP address in another, usually public address space. Because of the popularity of this technique to conserve IPv4 address space, the term &quot;NAT&quot; became virtually synonymous with IP masquerading.

In 1996, port-address translation (PAT) was introduced, which expanded the translation of addresses to include port numbers.

==Basic NAT==
The simplest type of NAT provides a one-to-one translation of IP addresses (RFC 1631). refers to this type of NAT as &quot;basic NAT&quot;, also called a &quot;one-to-one NAT&quot;. In this type of NAT, only the IP addresses, IP header checksum, and any higher-level checksums that include the IP address are changed. Basic NAT can be used to interconnect two IP networks with incompatible addresses.

==One-to-many NAT==
Most network address translators map multiple private hosts to one publicly exposed IP address. 

Here is a typical configuration:
# A local network uses one of the designated &quot;private&quot; IP address subnets (RFC 1918).
# The network has a router having both a private and a public address. The private address is used by the router for communicating with other devices in the private local network. The public address (typically assigned by an Internet service provider) is used by the router for communicating with the rest of the Internet.
# As traffic passes from the network to the Internet, NAT translates the source address in each packet from a private address to the router&#x27;s public address. The router tracks basic data about each active connection (particularly the destination address and port). When the router receives inbound traffic from the Internet, it uses the connection tracking data it stored during the outbound phase to determine to which private address (if any) it should forward the reply.

All IP packets have a source IP address and a destination IP address. Typically, packets passing from the private network to the public network will have their source address modified, while packets passing from the public network back to the private network will have their destination address modified. To avoid ambiguity in how replies are translated, further modifications to the packets are required. The vast bulk of Internet traffic uses Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or User Datagram Protocol (UDP). For these protocols, the port numbers are changed so that the combination of IP address (within the IP header) and port number (within the Transport Layer header) on the returned packet can be unambiguously mapped to the corresponding private network destination. RFC 2663 uses the term network address and port translation (NAPT) for this type of NAT. Other names include port address translation (PAT), &quot;IP masquerading&quot;, &quot;NAT overload&quot;, and &quot;many-to-one NAT&quot;. This is the most common type of NAT and has become synonymous with the term &quot;NAT&quot; in common usage.

This method allows communication through the router only when the conversation originates in the private network, since the initial originating transmission establishes the required information in the translation tables. Thus, a web browser within the private network is able to browse websites that are outside the network, whereas web browsers outside the network are unable to browse a website hosted within. Protocols not based on TCP and UDP require other translation techniques.

The primary benefit of one-to-many NAT is its role to mitigate IPv4 address exhaustion by allowing entire networks to be connected to the Internet using a single public IP address.

==Methods of translation==
Network address and port translation may be implemented in several ways. Some applications that use IP address information may need to determine the external address of a network address translator. This is the address that its communication peers in the external network detect. Furthermore, it may be necessary to examine and categorize the type of mapping in use, for example when it is desired to set up a direct communication path between two clients both of which are behind separate NAT gateways.

For this purpose, RFC 3489 specified the protocol &quot;Simple Traversal of UDP over NATs&quot; (STUN) in 2003. It classified NAT implementations as &quot;full-cone NAT&quot;, &quot;(address) restricted-cone NAT&quot;, &quot;port-restricted cone NAT&quot; or &quot;symmetric NAT&quot;, and proposed a methodology for testing a device accordingly. However, these procedures have since been deprecated from standards status, as the methods are inadequate to correctly assess many devices. RFC 5389 standardized new methods in 2008 and the acronym &quot;STUN&quot; since represents the new title of the specification: &quot;Session Traversal Utilities for NAT&quot;.

As many NAT implementations combine multiple types, it is better to refer to specific individual NAT behavior instead of using the Cone/Symmetric terminology. RFC 4787 attempts to alleviate confusion by introducing standardized terminology for observed behaviors. For the first bullet in each row of the above table, the RFC would characterize Full-Cone, Restricted-Cone, and Port-Restricted Cone NATs as having an &quot;Endpoint-Independent Mapping&quot;, whereas it would characterize a Symmetric NAT as having an &quot;Address- and Port-Dependent Mapping&quot;. For the second bullet in each row of the above table, RFC 4787 would also label Full-Cone NAT as having an &quot;Endpoint-Independent Filtering&quot;, Restricted-Cone NAT as having an &quot;Address-Dependent Filtering&quot;, Port-Restricted Cone NAT as having an &quot;Address and Port-Dependent Filtering&quot;, and Symmetric NAT as having either an &quot;Address-Dependent Filtering&quot; or &quot;Address and Port-Dependent Filtering&quot;. Other classifications of NAT behavior mentioned in the RFC include whether they preserve ports, when and how mappings are refreshed, whether external mappings can be used by internal hosts (i.e., its hairpinning behavior), and the level of determinism NATs exhibit when applying all these rules. Specifically, most NATs combine &quot;symmetric NAT&quot; for outgoing connections with &quot;static port mapping&quot;, where incoming packets addressed to the external address and port are redirected to a specific internal address and port.

===NAT mapping vs NAT filtering===

RFC 4787 distinguishes between NAT mapping and NAT filtering.

Section 4.1 of the RFC covers NAT mapping and specifies the translation of an external IP address and port number into an internal IP address and port number. It defines endpoint-independent mapping, address-dependent mapping and address and port-dependent mapping, explains that these three possible choices do not relate to the security of the NAT as security is determined by the filtering behavior and then specifies &quot;A NAT MUST have an &#x27;Endpoint-Independent Mapping&#x27; behavior.&quot;

Section 5 of the RFC covers NAT filtering and describes the criteria used by the NAT to filter packets originating from specific external endpoints. The options are endpoint-independent filtering, address-dependent filtering and address and port-dependent filtering. Endpoint-independent filtering is recommended where maximum application transparency is required while address-dependent filtering is recommended where more stringent filtering behavior is most important.

Some NAT devices are not compliant with RFC 4787 as they treat NAT mapping and filtering in the same way so that their configuration option for changing the NAT filtering method also changes the NAT mapping method (e.g. Netgate TNSR).

==Type of NAT and NAT traversal, role of port preservation for TCP==
NAT traversal problems arise when peers behind different NATs try to communicate. One way to solve this problem is to use port forwarding. Another way is to use various NAT traversal techniques. The most popular technique for TCP NAT traversal is TCP hole punching.

TCP hole punching requires the NAT to follow the &quot;port preservation&quot; design for TCP. For a given outgoing TCP communication, the same port numbers are used on both sides of the NAT. NAT port preservation for outgoing TCP connections is crucial for TCP NAT traversal because, under TCP, one port can only be used for one communication at a time. Programs that bind distinct TCP sockets to ephemeral ports for each TCP communication, make NAT port prediction impossible for TCP.

On the other hand, for UDP, NATs do not need port preservation. Indeed, multiple UDP communications (each with a distinct endpoint) can occur on the same source port, and applications usually reuse the same UDP socket to send packets to distinct hosts. This makes port prediction straightforward, as it is the same source port for each packet.

Furthermore, port preservation in NAT for TCP allows P2P protocols to offer less complexity and less latency because there is no need to use a third party (like STUN) to discover the NAT port since the application itself already knows the NAT port.

However, if two internal hosts attempt to communicate with the same external host using the same port number, the NAT may attempt to use a different external IP address for the second connection or may need to forgo port preservation and remap the port.

, roughly 70% of the clients in peer-to-peer (P2P) networks employed some form of NAT.

==Implementation==

===Establishing two-way communication===

Every TCP and UDP packet contains a source port number and a destination port number. Each of those packets is encapsulated in an IP packet, whose IP header contains a source IP address and a destination IP address. The IP address/protocol/port number triple defines an association with a network socket.

For publicly accessible services such as web and mail servers the port number is important. For example, port 443 connects through a socket to the web server software and port 465 to a mail server&#x27;s SMTP daemon. The IP address of a public server is also important, similar in global uniqueness to a postal address or telephone number. Both IP address and port number must be correctly known by all hosts wishing to successfully communicate.

Private IP addresses as described in RFC 1918 are usable only on private networks not directly connected to the internet. Ports are endpoints of communication unique to that host, so a connection through the NAT device is maintained by the combined mapping of port and IP address. A private address on the inside of the NAT is mapped to an external public address. Port address translation (PAT) resolves conflicts that arise when multiple hosts happen to use the same source port number to establish different external connections at the same time.

===Telephone number extension analogy===
A NAT device is similar to a phone system at an office that has one public telephone number and multiple extensions. Outbound phone calls made from the office all appear to come from the same telephone number. However, an incoming call that does not specify an extension cannot be automatically transferred to an individual inside the office. In this scenario, the office is a private LAN, the main phone number is the public IP address, and the individual extensions are unique port numbers.

===Translation process===
With NAT, all communications sent to external hosts actually contain the &quot;external&quot; IP address and port information of the NAT device instead of internal host IP addresses or port numbers. NAT only translates IP addresses and ports of its internal hosts, hiding the true endpoint of an internal host on a private network.

When a computer on the private (internal) network sends an IP packet to the external network, the NAT device replaces the internal source IP address in the packet header with the external IP address of the NAT device. PAT may then assign the connection a port number from a pool of available ports, inserting this port number in the source port field. The packet is then forwarded to the external network. The NAT device then makes an entry in a translation table containing the internal IP address, original source port, and the translated source port. Subsequent packets from the same internal source IP address and port number are translated to the same external source IP address and port number. The computer receiving a packet that has undergone NAT establishes a connection to the port and IP address specified in the altered packet, oblivious to the fact that the supplied address is being translated.

Upon receiving a packet from the external network, the NAT device searches the translation table based on the destination port in the packet header. If a match is found, the destination IP address and port number is replaced with the values found in the table and the packet is forwarded to the inside network. Otherwise, if the destination port number of the incoming packet is not found in the translation table, the packet is dropped or rejected because the PAT device doesn&#x27;t know where to send it.

==Applications==
;Routing: Network address translation can be used to mitigate IP address overlap. Address overlap occurs when hosts in different networks with the same IP address space try to reach the same destination host. This is most often a misconfiguration and may result from the merger of two networks or subnets, especially when using RFC 1918 private network addressing. The destination host experiences traffic apparently arriving from the same network, and intermediate routers have no way to determine where reply traffic should be sent to. The solution is either renumbering to eliminate overlap or network address translation.

;Load balancing: In client–server applications, load balancers forward client requests to a set of server computers to manage the workload of each server. Network address translation may be used to map a representative IP address of the server cluster to specific hosts that service the request.

==Related techniques==
IEEE Reverse Address and Port Translation (RAPT or RAT) allows a host whose real IP address changes from time to time to remain reachable as a server via a fixed home IP address. Cisco&#x27;s RAPT implementation is PAT or NAT overloading and maps multiple private IP addresses to a single public IP address. Multiple addresses can be mapped to a single address because each private address is tracked by a port number. PAT uses unique source port numbers on the inside global IP address to distinguish between translations. PAT attempts to preserve the original source port. If this source port is already used, PAT assigns the first available port number starting from the beginning of the appropriate port group 0–511, 512–1023, or 1024–65535. When there are no more ports available and there is more than one external IP address configured, PAT moves to the next IP address to try to allocate the original source port again. This process continues until it runs out of available ports and external IP addresses.

Mapping of Address and Port is a Cisco proposal that combines Address plus Port translation with tunneling of the IPv4 packets over an ISP provider&#x27;s internal IPv6 network. In effect, it is an (almost) stateless alternative to carrier-grade NAT and DS-Lite that pushes the IPv4 address/port translation function (and the maintenance of NAT state) entirely into the existing customer premises equipment NAT implementation. Thus avoiding the NAT444 and statefulness problems of carrier-grade NAT, and also provides a transition mechanism for the deployment of native IPv6 at the same time with very little added complexity.

==Issues and limitations==
Hosts behind NAT-enabled routers do not have end-to-end connectivity and cannot participate in some internet protocols. Services that require the initiation of TCP connections from the outside network, or that use stateless protocols such as those using UDP, can be disrupted. Unless the NAT router makes a specific effort to support such protocols, incoming packets cannot reach their destination. Some protocols can accommodate one instance of NAT between participating hosts (&quot;passive mode&quot; FTP, for example), sometimes with the assistance of an application-level gateway (see ), but fail when both systems are separated from the internet by NAT. The use of NAT also complicates tunneling protocols such as IPsec because NAT modifies values in the headers which interfere with the integrity checks done by IPsec and other tunneling protocols.

End-to-end connectivity has been a core principle of the Internet, supported, for example, by the Internet Architecture Board. Current Internet architectural documents observe that NAT is a violation of the end-to-end principle, but that NAT does have a valid role in careful design. There is considerably more concern with the use of IPv6 NAT, and many IPv6 architects believe IPv6 was intended to remove the need for NAT.

An implementation that only tracks ports can be quickly depleted by internal applications that use multiple simultaneous connections such as an HTTP request for a web page with many embedded objects. This problem can be mitigated by tracking the destination IP address in addition to the port thus sharing a single local port with many remote hosts. This additional tracking increases implementation complexity and computing resources at the translation device.

Because the internal addresses are all disguised behind one publicly accessible address, it is impossible for external hosts to directly initiate a connection to a particular internal host. Applications such as VOIP, videoconferencing, and other peer-to-peer applications must use NAT traversal techniques to function.

=== Fragmentation and checksums ===
Pure NAT, operating on IP alone, may or may not correctly parse protocols with payloads containing information about IP, such as ICMP. This depends on whether the payload is interpreted by a host on the &quot;inside&quot; or &quot;outside&quot; of the translation. Basic protocols as TCP and UDP cannot function properly unless NAT takes action beyond the network layer.

IP packets have a checksum in each packet header, which provides error detection only for the header. IP datagrams may become fragmented and it is necessary for a NAT to reassemble these fragments to allow correct recalculation of higher-level checksums and correct tracking of which packets belong to which connection.

TCP and UDP, have a checksum that covers all the data they carry, as well as the TCP or UDP header, plus a &quot;pseudo-header&quot; that contains the source and destination IP addresses of the packet carrying the TCP or UDP header. For an originating NAT to pass TCP or UDP successfully, it must recompute the TCP or UDP header checksum based on the translated IP addresses, not the original ones, and put that checksum into the TCP or UDP header of the first packet of the fragmented set of packets.

Alternatively, the originating host may perform path MTU Discovery to determine the packet size that can be transmitted without fragmentation and then set the &quot;don&#x27;t fragment&quot; (DF) bit in the appropriate packet header field. This is only a one-way solution, because the responding host can send packets of any size, which may be fragmented before reaching the NAT.

== Variant terms ==

=== DNAT ===
Destination network address translation (DNAT) is a technique for transparently changing the destination IP address of a routed packet and performing the inverse function for any replies. Any router situated between two endpoints can perform this transformation of the packet.

DNAT is commonly used to publish a service located in a private network on a publicly accessible IP address. This use of DNAT is also called port forwarding, or DMZ when used on an entire server, which becomes exposed to the WAN, becoming analogous to an undefended military demilitarized zone (DMZ).

=== SNAT ===
The meaning of the term &quot;SNAT&quot; varies by vendor:
* &quot;source NAT&quot; is a common expansion and is the counterpart of &quot;destination NAT&quot; (&quot;DNAT&quot;). This is used to describe one-to-many NAT; NAT for outgoing connections to public services.
* &quot;stateful NAT&quot; is used by Cisco Systems
* &quot;static NAT&quot; is used by WatchGuard
* &quot;secure NAT&quot; is used by F5 and by Microsoft (in regard to the ISA Server)

Secure network address translation (SNAT) is part of Microsoft&#x27;s Internet Security and Acceleration Server and is an extension to the NAT driver built into Microsoft Windows Server. It provides connection tracking and filtering for the additional network connections needed for the FTP, ICMP, H.323, and PPTP protocols as well as the ability to configure a transparent HTTP proxy server.

=== Dynamic network address translation ===

Dynamic NAT, just like static NAT, is not common in smaller networks but is found within larger corporations with complex networks. Where static NAT provides a one-to-one internal to public static IP address mapping, dynamic NAT uses a &quot;group&quot; of public IP addresses.

==NAT hairpinning==
NAT hairpinning, also known as NAT loopback or NAT reflection, is a feature in many consumer routers where a machine on the LAN is able to access another machine on the LAN via the external IP address of the LAN/router (with port forwarding set up on the router to direct requests to the appropriate machine on the LAN). This notion is officially described in 2008, .

The following describes an example network:
* Public address: . This is the address of the WAN interface on the router.
* Internal address of router: 
* Address of the server: 
* Address of a local computer: 

If a packet is sent to by a computer at , the packet would normally be routed to the default gateway (the router) A router with the NAT loopback feature detects that is the address of its WAN interface, and treats the packet as if coming from that interface. It determines the destination for that packet, based on DNAT (port forwarding) rules for the destination. If the data were sent to port 80 and a DNAT rule exists for port 80 directed to , then the host at that address receives the packet.

If no applicable DNAT rule is available, the router drops the packet. An ICMP Destination Unreachable reply may be sent. If any DNAT rules were present, address translation is still in effect; the router still rewrites the source IP address in the packet. The local computer () sends the packet as coming from , but the server () receives it as coming from . When the server replies, the process is identical to an external sender. Thus, two-way communication is possible between hosts inside the LAN network via the public IP address.

==NAT in IPv6==
Network address translation is not commonly used in IPv6 because one of the design goals of IPv6 is to restore end-to-end network connectivity. The large addressing space of IPv6 obviates the need to conserve addresses and every device can be given a unique globally routable address. Use of unique local addresses in combination with network prefix translation can achieve results similar to NAT.

The large addressing space of IPv6 can still be defeated depending on the actual prefix length given by the carrier. It is not uncommon to be handed a /64 prefix – the smallest recommended subnet – for an entire home network, requiring a variety of techniques to be used to manually subdivide the range for all devices to remain reachable. Even actual IPv6-to-IPv6 NAT, NAT66, can turn out useful at times: the APNIC blog outlines a case where the author was only provided a single address (/128).

==Applications affected by NAT==
Some application layer protocols, such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), send explicit network addresses within their application data. File Transfer Protocol in active mode, for example, uses separate connections for control traffic (commands) and for data traffic (file contents). When requesting a file transfer, the host making the request identifies the corresponding data connection by its network layer and transport layer addresses. If the host making the request lies behind a simple NAT firewall, the translation of the IP address or TCP port number makes the information received by the server invalid. SIP commonly controls voice over IP calls, and suffer the same problem. SIP and its accompanying Session Description Protocol may use multiple ports to set up a connection and transmit voice stream via Real-time Transport Protocol. IP addresses and port numbers are encoded in the payload data and must be known before the traversal of NATs. Without special techniques, such as STUN, NAT behavior is unpredictable and communications may fail. Application Layer Gateway (ALG) software or hardware may correct these problems. An ALG software module running on a NAT firewall device updates any payload data made invalid by address translation. ALGs need to understand the higher-layer protocol that they need to fix, and so each protocol with this problem requires a separate ALG. For example, on many Linux systems, there are kernel modules called &quot;connection trackers&quot; that serve to implement ALGs. However, ALG cannot work if the protocol data is encrypted.

Another possible solution to this problem is to use NAT traversal techniques using protocols such as STUN or Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE), or proprietary approaches in a session border controller. NAT traversal is possible in both TCP- and UDP-based applications, but the UDP-based technique is simpler, more widely understood, and more compatible with legacy NATs. In either case, the high-level protocol must be designed with NAT traversal in mind, and it does not work reliably across symmetric NATs or other poorly behaved legacy NATs.

Other possibilities are Port Control Protocol (PCP), NAT Port Mapping Protocol (NAT-PMP), or Internet Gateway Device Protocol but these require the NAT device to implement that protocol.

Most client–server protocols (FTP being the main exception), however, do not send layer 3 contact information and do not require any special treatment by NATs. In fact, avoiding NAT complications is practically a requirement when designing new higher-layer protocols today.

NATs can also cause problems where IPsec encryption is applied and in cases where multiple devices such as SIP phones are located behind a NAT. Phones that encrypt their signaling with IPsec encapsulate the port information within an encrypted packet, meaning that NAT devices cannot access and translate the port. In these cases, the NAT devices revert to simple NAT operations. This means that all traffic returning to the NAT is mapped onto one client, causing service to more than one client behind the NAT to fail. There are a couple of solutions to this problem: one is to use TLS, which operates at layer 4 and does not mask the port number; another is to encapsulate the IPsec within UDP – the latter being the solution chosen by TISPAN to achieve secure NAT traversal, or a NAT with &quot;IPsec Passthru&quot; support; another is to use a session border controller to help traverse the NAT.

Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) is a NAT traversal technique that does not rely on ALG support.

The DNS protocol vulnerability announced by Dan Kaminsky on July 8, 2008, is indirectly affected by NAT port mapping. To avoid DNS cache poisoning, it is highly desirable not to translate UDP source port numbers of outgoing DNS requests from a DNS server behind a firewall that implements NAT. The recommended workaround for the DNS vulnerability is to make all caching DNS servers use randomized UDP source ports. If the NAT function de-randomizes the UDP source ports, the DNS server becomes vulnerable.

<text>A key in cryptography is a piece of information, usually a string of numbers or letters that are stored in a file, which, when processed through a cryptographic algorithm, can encode or decode cryptographic data. Based on the used method, the key can be different sizes and varieties, but in all cases, the strength of the encryption relies on the security of the key being maintained. A key&#x27;s security strength is dependent on its algorithm, the size of the key, the generation of the key, and the process of key exchange.

== Scope ==
The key is what is used to encrypt data from plaintext to ciphertext. There are different methods for utilizing keys and encryption.

=== Symmetric cryptography ===
Symmetric cryptography refers to the practice of the same key being used for both encryption and decryption.

=== Asymmetric cryptography ===
Asymmetric cryptography has separate keys for encrypting and decrypting. These keys are known as the public and private keys, respectively.

== Purpose ==
Since the key protects the confidentiality and integrity of the system, it is important to be kept secret from unauthorized parties. With public key cryptography, only the private key must be kept secret, but with symmetric cryptography, it is important to maintain the confidentiality of the key. Kerckhoff&#x27;s principle states that the entire security of the cryptographic system relies on the secrecy of the key.

== Key sizes ==
Key size is the number of bits in the key defined by the algorithm. This size defines the upper bound of the cryptographic algorithm&#x27;s security. The larger the key size, the longer it will take before the key is compromised by a brute force attack. Since perfect secrecy is not feasible for key algorithms, researches are now more focused on computational security.

In the past, keys were required to be a minimum of 40 bits in length, however, as technology advanced, these keys were being broken quicker and quicker. As a response, restrictions on symmetric keys were enhanced to be greater in size.

Currently, 2048 bit RSA is commonly used, which is sufficient for current systems. However, current key sizes would all be cracked quickly with a powerful quantum computer.

“The keys used in public key cryptography have some mathematical structure. For example, public keys used in the RSA system are the product of two prime numbers. Thus public key systems require longer key lengths than symmetric systems for an equivalent level of security. 3072 bits is the suggested key length for systems based on factoring and integer discrete logarithms which aim to have security equivalent to a 128 bit symmetric cipher.”

== Key generation ==

To prevent a key from being guessed, keys need to be generated randomly and contain sufficient entropy. The problem of how to safely generate random keys is difficult and has been addressed in many ways by various cryptographic systems. A key can directly be generated by using the output of a Random Bit Generator (RBG), a system that generates a sequence of unpredictable and unbiased bits. A RBG can be used to directly produce either a symmetric key or the random output for an asymmetric key pair generation. Alternatively, a key can also be indirectly created during a key-agreement transaction, from another key or from a password.

Some operating systems include tools for &quot;collecting&quot; entropy from the timing of unpredictable operations such as disk drive head movements. For the production of small amounts of keying material, ordinary dice provide a good source of high-quality randomness.

== Establishment scheme ==

The security of a key is dependent on how a key is exchanged between parties. Establishing a secured communication channel is necessary so that outsiders cannot obtain the key. A key establishment scheme (or key exchange) is used to transfer an encryption key among entities. Key agreement and key transport are the two types of a key exchange scheme that are used to be  remotely exchanged between entities . In a key agreement scheme, a secret key, which is used between the sender and the receiver to encrypt and decrypt information, is set up to be sent indirectly. All parties exchange information (the shared secret) that permits each party to derive the secret key material. In a key transport scheme, encrypted keying material that is chosen by the sender is transported to the receiver. Either symmetric key or asymmetric key techniques can be used in both schemes.

The Diffie–Hellman key exchange and Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) are the most two widely used key exchange algorithms. In 1976, Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman constructed the Diffie–Hellman algorithm, which was the first public key algorithm. The Diffie–Hellman key exchange protocol allows key exchange over an insecure channel by electronically generating a shared key between two parties. On the other hand, RSA is a form of the asymmetric key system which consists of three steps: key generation, encryption, and decryption.

Key confirmation delivers an assurance between the key confirmation recipient and provider that the shared keying materials are correct and established. The National Institute of Standards and Technology recommends key confirmation to be integrated into a key establishment scheme to validate its implementations.

== Management ==

Key management concerns the generation, establishment, storage, usage and replacement of cryptographic keys. A key management system (KMS) typically includes three steps of establishing, storing and using keys. The base of security for the generation, storage, distribution, use and destruction of keys depends on successful key management protocols.

== Key vs password ==

A password is a memorized series of characters including letters, digits, and other special symbols that are used to verify identity. It is often produced by a human user or a password management software to protect personal and sensitive information or generate cryptographic keys. Passwords are often created to be memorized by users and may contain non-random information such as dictionary words. On the other hand, a key can help strengthen password protection by implementing a cryptographic algorithm which is difficult to guess or replace the password altogether. A key is generated based on random or pseudo-random data and can often be unreadable to humans.

A password is less safe than a cryptographic key due to its low entropy, randomness, and human-readable properties. However, the password may be the only secret data that is accessible to the cryptographic algorithm for information security in some applications such as securing information in storage devices. Thus, a deterministic algorithm called a key derivation function (KDF) uses a password to generate the secure cryptographic keying material to compensate for the password&#x27;s weakness. Various methods such as adding a salt or key stretching may be used in the generation.

<text>Symmetric-key algorithms are algorithms for cryptography that use the same cryptographic keys for both the encryption of plaintext and the decryption of ciphertext. The keys may be identical, or there may be a simple transformation to go between the two keys. The keys, in practice, represent a shared secret between two or more parties that can be used to maintain a private information link. The requirement that both parties have access to the secret key is one of the main drawbacks of symmetric-key encryption, in comparison to public-key encryption (also known as asymmetric-key encryption). However, symmetric-key encryption algorithms are usually better for bulk encryption. With exception of the one-time pad they have a smaller key size, which means less storage space and faster transmission. Due to this, asymmetric-key encryption is often used to exchange the secret key for symmetric-key encryption.

== Types ==
Symmetric-key encryption can use either stream ciphers or block ciphers. 

Stream ciphers encrypt the digits (typically bytes), or letters (in substitution ciphers) of a message one at a time. An example is ChaCha20. Substitution ciphers are well-known ciphers, but can be easily decrypted using a frequency table.

Block ciphers take a number of bits and encrypt them in a single unit, padding the plaintext to achieve a multiple of the block size. The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm, approved by NIST in December 2001, uses 128-bit blocks.

== Implementations ==
Examples of popular symmetric-key algorithms include Twofish, Serpent, AES (Rijndael), Camellia, Salsa20, ChaCha20, Blowfish, CAST5, Kuznyechik, RC4, DES, 3DES, Skipjack, Safer, and IDEA.

== Use as a cryptographic primitive ==
Symmetric ciphers are commonly used to achieve other cryptographic primitives than just encryption.

Encrypting a message does not guarantee that it will remain unchanged while encrypted. Hence, often a message authentication code is added to a ciphertext to ensure that changes to the ciphertext will be noted by the receiver. Message authentication codes can be constructed from an AEAD cipher (e.g. AES-GCM).

However, symmetric ciphers cannot be used for non-repudiation purposes except by involving additional parties. See the ISO/IEC 13888-2 standard.

Another application is to build hash functions from block ciphers. See one-way compression function for descriptions of several such methods.

== Construction of symmetric ciphers ==
Many modern block ciphers are based on a construction proposed by Horst Feistel. Feistel&#x27;s construction makes it possible to build invertible functions from other functions that are themselves not invertible.

== Security of symmetric ciphers ==
Symmetric ciphers have historically been susceptible to known-plaintext attacks, chosen-plaintext attacks, differential cryptanalysis and linear cryptanalysis. Careful construction of the functions for each round can greatly reduce the chances of a successful attack. It is also possible to increase the key length or the rounds in the encryption process to better protect against attack. This, however, tends to increase the processing power and decrease the speed at which the process runs due to the amount of operations the system needs to do.

Most modern symmetric-key algorithms appear to be resistant to the threat of post-quantum cryptography. Quantum computers would exponentially increase the speed at which these ciphers can be decoded; notably, Grover&#x27;s algorithm would take the square-root of the time traditionally required for a brute-force attack, although these vulnerabilities can be compensated for by doubling key length. For example, a 128 bit AES cipher would not be secure against such an attack as it would reduce the time required to test all possible iterations from over 10 quintillion years to about six months. By contrast, it would still take a quantum computer the same amount of time to decode a 256 bit AES cipher as it would a conventional computer to decode a 128 bit AES cipher. For this reason, AES-256 is believed to be &quot;quantum resistant&quot;.

== Key management ==
== Key establishment ==

Symmetric-key algorithms require both the sender and the recipient of a message to have the same secret key. All early cryptographic systems required either the sender or the recipient to somehow receive a copy of that secret key over a physically secure channel.

Nearly all modern cryptographic systems still use symmetric-key algorithms internally to encrypt the bulk of the messages, but they eliminate the need for a physically secure channel by using Diffie–Hellman key exchange or some other public-key protocol to securely come to agreement on a fresh new secret key for each session/conversation (forward secrecy).

== Key generation ==

When used with asymmetric ciphers for key transfer, pseudorandom key generators are nearly always used to generate the symmetric cipher session keys. However, lack of randomness in those generators or in their initialization vectors is disastrous and has led to cryptanalytic breaks in the past. Therefore, it is essential that an implementation use a source of high entropy for its initialization.

== Reciprocal cipher ==
A reciprocal cipher is a cipher where, just as one enters the plaintext into the cryptography system to get the ciphertext, one could enter the ciphertext into the same place in the system to get the plaintext. A reciprocal cipher is also sometimes referred as self-reciprocal cipher.

Practically all mechanical cipher machines implement a reciprocal cipher, a mathematical involution on each typed-in letter.
Instead of designing two kinds of machines, one for encrypting and one for decrypting, all the machines can be identical and can be set up (keyed) the same way.

Examples of reciprocal ciphers include:
* Atbash
* Beaufort cipher
* Enigma machine
* Marie Antoinette and Axel von Fersen communicated with a self-reciprocal cipher.
* the Porta polyalphabetic cipher is self-reciprocal.
* Purple cipher
* RC4
* ROT13
* XOR cipher
* Vatsyayana cipher

The majority of all modern ciphers can be classified as either a stream cipher, most of which use a reciprocal XOR cipher combiner, or a block cipher, most of which use a Feistel cipher or Lai–Massey scheme with a reciprocal transformation in each round.

<text>Lenin Peak or Ibn Sina (Avicenna) Peak (, ; ; , renamed () in July 2006), rises to in Gorno-Badakhshan (GBAO) on the Kyrgyzstan–Tajikistan border, and is the second-highest point of both countries. It is considered one of the less technical 7,000 m peaks in the world to climb and it has by far the most ascents of any 7,000 m or higher peak on Earth, with every year seeing hundreds of mountaineers make their way to the summit. Lenin Peak is the highest mountain in the Trans-Alay Range of Central Asia, and in the Pamir Mountains in Tajikistan it is exceeded only by Ismoil Somoni Peak (7,495 m). It was thought to be the highest point in the Pamirs in Tajikistan until 1933, when Ismoil Somoni Peak (known as &quot;Stalin Peak&quot; at the time) was climbed and found to be more than 300 metres higher. Two mountains in the Pamirs in China, Kongur Tagh (7,649 m) and Muztagh Ata (7,546 m), are higher than the Tajik summits.

==Names==
Lenin Peak was originally named Mount Kaufmann after Konstantin Kaufman, the first Governor-General of the Russian Turkestan. In 1928, the mountain was renamed Lenin Peak after the Russian revolutionary and first leader of the Soviet Union, Vladimir Lenin. In Tajikistan, the peak was renamed again in July 2006, and today it is officially called in Tajik &quot;Qullai Abuali ibni Sino&quot; (&quot;қуллаи Абӯалӣ ибни Сино&quot;, Ibn Sina Peak or, alternatively, Avicenna Peak) after Abu Ali ibn Sina (Avicenna).

In Kyrgyzstan, the peak is still officially called &quot;Lenin Chokusu&quot; (&quot;Ленин Чокусу&quot;, Lenin Peak). However, in October 2017, Kyrgyz president Almazbek Atambayev called for renaming the peak &quot;Manas Peak&quot;, after the hero of the Epic of Manas. A peak named &quot;Manas Peak&quot; already exists in Kyrgyzstan; it is a mountain of in the Talas Alatau range in Talas Region.

Local Kyrgyz names include Jel-Aidar (&quot;Wind&#x27;s God&quot;) and Achyk-Tash (&quot;Open Rock&quot;). &quot;Achik-Tash&quot;, is also the name of a plateau and a base camp at an elevation of 3,600 m on a popular northern climbing route to Lenin Peak, which starts in the southern Kyrgyz city of Osh, a day&#x27;s drive north of the border. Another suggested local name, Pik Kaman (&quot;wild pig&quot;, &quot;boar&quot;) probably belongs to an officially unnamed peak west of Lenin Peak.

== Climbing history and routes ==
Initial exploration of this part of Central Asia occurred in the period 1774–82. Arguably the first recorded travel through the region is the involuntary journey of the slave Filipp Efremov (an ethnic Russian), who escaped from slavery in Bukhara. He crossed the Fergana valley, then via Osh, the Chigirik Pass and Terekdavan Pass he reached the Kashgar and finally came over the Karakorum. He was the first European who crossed the Alai Mountains.

Scientific expeditions to the Alai Mountains began in 1871, when Alexei Pavlovich Fedchenko discovered the Trans-Alai (Zaalayskiy) Range and its main peak. The first geographical expedition which came nearest to the base of the future Lenin Peak in the early 20th century was arguably the expedition of Nikolai Leopol&#x27;dovich Korzhenevskiy.

In September 1928, three mountaineers—the Germans and Karl Wien, and the Austrian —from the Soviet-German scientific expedition made the first attempt to reach the highest point of the Trans-Alai Range, which at that time had the name Kaufman Peak. They started climbing upstream of the Saukdara river along the South slope of Trans-Alai Range also Trans-Alay Range. From the river head they continued climbing along the Greater Saukdara Glacier towards a saddle at an elevation of 5820 m (this saddle is also known as the Krilenko Pass). On September 25, 1928, they started climbing from the saddle along the NE Ridge and at 15.30 they reached the summit. At the time, Kaufman Peak was the highest summit reached in the world. Schneider himself broke that record two years later when he made the first ascent of Jongsong Peak. 

The title Lenin Peak was first applied to the highest point of the Trans-Alai Range in the same year (1928). When it was renamed after Lenin it was believed to be the highest point in the USSR.

On September 8, 1934, at 16:20 Kasian Chernuha, Vitaly Abalakov and Ivan Lukin, three members of a Soviet expedition, reached the summit at an elevation of . Their attempt lasted for four days with three camps (5,700 m, 6,500 m and 7,000 m). The expedition started climbing from the Achik-Tash canyon in the Alai valley. The summit attempt itself was started along the Western ice slope of the Lenin glacier. They continued climbing along the North Face, passing the rocks that were later given the name Lipkin&#x27;s Rocks. At the end of the second day they reached the crest of the NE ridge at an elevation of about 6500 m. During the following day and a half they climbed along the NE Ridge and, utterly exhausted, reached the summit.

The third ascent was three years later, in 1937, when eight Soviet climbers under the direction of Lev Barkhash reached the summit by the same route. This was at the beginning of mass political repressions in the Soviet Union and many of the most prominent Soviet climbers, including Lev Barkhash, were brought to trial.

Subsequent attempts to climb Lenin Peak could not begin until 1950, when the USSR began to recover from the Second World War. On August 14, 1950, twelve climbers (V. Aksenov, K, Zaporojchenko, Y. Izrael, V. Kovalev, A. Kormshikov, Y. Maslov, E. Nagel, V. Narishkin, V. Nikonov, V. Nozdryuhin, I. Rojkov) under the direction of Vladimir Racek reached the summit for the fourth time.

All three Soviet expeditions including Racec&#x27;s expedition of 1950 were by almost the same route via the NE Ridge.

The route which now is known as the classic route, via the Razdelnaya Peak and NW Ridge, was first climbed in 1954 by the team of Soviet climbers under the direction of V. Kovalev (P. Karpov, E. Nagel, V. Narishkin, V. Nozdryuhin).
In 1960, a group of eight Soviet climbers made a successful direct climb along the North Face (15.08.1960).

There are 16 established routes, nine on the southern side and seven on the northern slopes. The peak is quite popular with climbers due to its easy access and some uncomplicated routes. However, the peak is not without its share of disasters.

In August 1974, an entire team of eight Russian women climbers died high on the mountain in a storm. Elwira Szatajewa maintained radio contact with base camp as her team-mates perished around her. In her final words she said, &#x27;I&#x27;m alone now, with just a few minutes left to live. See you in eternity.&#x27;

The first high-speed ascent of Lenin Peak was completed in 1987. The team, led by Valery Khrichtchatyi, included G. Lunyakov, Z. Khalitov, Anatoli Boukreev, V. Suviga, Y. Moiseev and A. Tselischev. The climb beginning from ABC base camp (4400 m) to the summit and return to ABC base camp took 12 hours.

Under the leadership of Leonid Troshchinenko the team, composed of 19 mountaineers from Leningrad and three from Kazakhstan, made the first winter ascent of Lenin Peak in 1988. With temperatures hovering at -45 °C, only six men reached the summit: including Valery Khrichtchatyi, Balyberdin, S. Arsentiev, U. Moiseev, I. Tulaiev and V. Dedi.

In 1987 the first solo ascent was achieved by the great high altitude mountaineer Anatoli Boukreev. An avalanche triggered by an earthquake killed 43 climbers in 1990.

As it is now, considering the existing infrastructure and BC/ABC locations, there are three most attractive routes from the North (approximately indicated on the Scheme): Lipkin&#x27;s rocks route and NE Ridge; the classic North Face route; the route via Razdelnaya Peak and the NW Ridge.

<text>File Allocation Table (FAT) is a file system developed for personal computers and was the default file system for the MS-DOS and Windows 9x operating systems. Originally developed in 1977 for use on floppy disks, it was adapted for use on hard disks and other devices. The increase in disk drive capacity over time drove modifications to the design that resulted in versions: FAT12, FAT16, FAT32, and exFAT. FAT was replaced with NTFS as the default file system on Microsoft operating systems starting with Windows XP. Nevertheless, FAT continues to be commonly used on relatively small capacity solid-state storage technologies such as SD card, MultiMediaCard (MMC) and eMMC because of its compatibility and ease of implementation.

== Uses ==
=== Historical ===
FAT was used on hard disks throughout the DOS and Windows 9x eras. Microsoft introduced NTFS with the Windows NT platform in 1993, but FAT remained the standard for the home user until the introduction of Windows XP in 2001. Windows Me was the final version of Windows to use FAT as its default file system.

For floppy disks, FAT has been standardized as ECMA-107 and ISO/IEC 9293:1994 (superseding ISO 9293:1987). These standards cover FAT12 and FAT16 with only short 8.3 filename support; long filenames with VFAT were partially patented. While FAT12 is used on floppy disks, FAT16 and FAT32 are typically found on the larger media.

=== Modern ===
FAT is used internally for the EFI system partition in the boot stage of EFI-compliant computers.

FAT is still used in drives expected to be used by multiple operating systems, such as in shared Windows, Linux and DOS environments. Microsoft Windows additionally comes with a pre-installed tool to convert a FAT file system into NTFS directly without the need to rewrite all files, though this cannot be reversed easily. The FAT file system is used in removable media such as floppy disks, super-floppies, memory and flash memory cards or USB flash drives. FAT is supported by portable devices such as PDAs, digital cameras, camcorders, media players, and mobile phones.

The DCF file system adopted by almost all digital cameras since 1998 defines a logical file system with 8.3 filenames and makes the use of either FAT12, FAT16, FAT32 or exFAT mandatory for its physical layer for compatibility.

== Technical details ==





The file system uses an index table stored on the device to identify chains of data storage areas associated with a file, the &quot;File Allocation Table&quot; (&quot;FAT&quot;). The FAT is statically allocated at the time of formatting. The table is a linked list of entries for each &quot;cluster&quot;, a contiguous area of disk storage. Each entry contains either the number of the next cluster in the file, or else a marker indicating the end of the file, unused disk space, or special reserved areas of the disk. The &quot;root directory&quot; of the disk contains the number of the first cluster of each file in that directory. The operating system can then traverse the FAT, looking up the cluster number of each successive part of the disk file as a &quot;cluster chain&quot; until the end of the file is reached. &quot;Sub-directories&quot; are implemented as special files containing the &quot;directory entries&quot; of their respective files.

Each entry in the FAT linked list is a fixed number of bits: 12, 16 or 32. The maximum size of a file or a disk drive that can be accessed is the product of the largest number that can be stored in the entries (less a few values reserved to indicate unallocated space or the end of a list) and the size of the disk cluster. Even if only one byte of storage is needed to extend a file, an entire cluster must be allocated to it. As a result, large numbers of small files can result in clusters being allocated that may contain mostly &quot;empty&quot; data to meet the minimum cluster size.

Originally designed as an 8-bit file system, the maximum number of clusters must increase as disk drive capacity increases, and so the number of bits used to identify each cluster has grown. The successive major variants of the FAT format are named after the number of table element bits: 12 (FAT12), 16 (FAT16), and 32 (FAT32).

== Variants ==
There are several variants of the FAT file system (e.g. FAT12, FAT16 and FAT32). FAT16 refers to both the original group of FAT file systems with 16-bit wide cluster entries and also to later variants. &quot;VFAT&quot; is an optional extension for long file names, which can work on top of any FAT file system. Volumes using VFAT long-filenames can be read also by operating systems not supporting the VFAT extension.

=== Original 8-bit FAT ===
The original FAT file system (or &quot;FAT structure&quot;, as it was called initially) was designed and implemented by Marc McDonald, based on a series of discussions between McDonald and Bill Gates.
It was introduced with 8-bit table elements (and valid data cluster numbers up to codice_1) in a precursor to Microsoft&#x27;s &quot;Standalone Disk BASIC-80&quot; for an 8080-based successor of the NCR 7200 model VI data-entry terminal, equipped with 8-inch (200 mm) floppy disks, in 1977 or 1978.
In 1978, &quot;Standalone Disk BASIC-80&quot; was ported to the 8086 using an emulator on a DEC PDP-10, since no real 8086 systems were available at this time.
The FAT file system was also used in Microsoft&#x27;s MDOS/MIDAS, an operating system for 8080/Z80 platforms written by McDonald since 1979.
The &quot;Standalone Disk BASIC&quot; version supported three FATs, whereas this was a parameter for MIDAS. Reportedly, MIDAS was also prepared to support 10-bit, 12-bit and 16-bit FAT variants. While the size of directory entries was 16 bytes in &quot;Standalone Disk BASIC&quot;, MIDAS instead occupied 32 bytes per entry.

Tim Paterson of Seattle Computer Products (SCP) was first introduced to Microsoft&#x27;s FAT structure when he helped Bob O&#x27;Rear adapting the &quot;Standalone Disk BASIC-86&quot; emulator port onto SCP&#x27;s S-100 bus 8086 CPU board prototype during a guest week at Microsoft in May 1979. The final product was shown at Lifeboat Associates&#x27; booth stand at the National Computer Conference in New York on June 4–7, 1979, where Paterson learned about the more sophisticated FAT implementation in MDOS/MIDAS and McDonald talked to him about the design of the file system.

=== FAT12 ===
Between April and August 1980, while borrowing the FAT concept for SCP&#x27;s own 8086 operating system QDOS 0.10, Tim Paterson extended the table elements to 12 bits, reduced the number of FATs to two, redefined the semantics of some of the reserved cluster values, and modified the disk layout, so that the root directory was now located between the FAT and the data area for his implementation of FAT12. Paterson also increased the nine-character (6.3) filename length limit to eleven characters to support CP/M-style 8.3 filenames and File Control Blocks. The format used in Microsoft &quot;Standalone Disk BASIC&#x27;s&quot; 8-bit file system precursor was not supported by QDOS. By August 1980, QDOS had been renamed to 86-DOS. Starting with 86-DOS 0.42, the size and layout of directory entries was changed from 16 bytes to 32 bytes in order to add a file date stamp and increase the theoretical file size limit beyond the previous limit of 16 MB.
86-DOS 1.00 became available in early 1981. Later in 1981, 86-DOS evolved into Microsoft&#x27;s MS-DOS and IBM PC DOS.
The capability to read previously formatted volumes with 16-byte directory entries was dropped with MS-DOS 1.20.

FAT12 used 12-bit entries for the cluster addresses; some values were reserved to mark the end of a chain of clusters, to mark unusable areas of the disk, or for other purposes, so the maximum number of clusters was limited to 4078. To conserve disk space, two 12-bit FAT entries used three consecutive 8-bit bytes on disk, requiring manipulation to unpack the 12-bit values. This was sufficient for the original floppy disk drives, and small hard disks up to 32 megabytes. The FAT16B version available with DOS 3.31 supported 32-bit sector numbers, and so increased the volume size limit.

All the control structures fit inside the first track, to avoid head movement during read and write operations. Any bad sector in the control structures area would make the disk unusable. The DOS formatting tool rejected such disks completely. Bad sectors were allowed only in the file data area. Clusters containing bad sectors were marked unusable with the reserved value codice_2 in the FAT.

While 86-DOS supported three disk formats (250.25 KB, 616 KB and 1232 KB, with FAT IDs codice_3 and codice_4) on 8-inch (200 mm) floppy drives, IBM PC DOS 1.0, released with the original IBM Personal Computer in 1981, supported only an 8-sector floppy format with a formatted capacity of 160 KB (FAT ID codice_4) for single-sided 5.25-inch floppy drives, and PC DOS 1.1 added support for a double-sided format with 320 KB (FAT ID codice_3). PC DOS 2.0 introduced support for 9-sector floppy formats with 180 KB (FAT ID codice_7) and 360 KB (FAT ID codice_8).

86-DOS 1.00 and PC DOS 1.0 directory entries included only one date, the last modified date. PC DOS 1.1 added the last modified time. PC DOS 1.x file attributes included a hidden bit and system bit, with the remaining six bits undefined. At this time, DOS did not support sub-directories, but typically there were only a few dozen files on a diskette.

The PC XT was the first PC with an IBM-supplied hard drive, and PC DOS 2.0 supported that hard drive with FAT12 (FAT ID codice_9). The fixed assumption of 8 sectors per clusters on hard disks practically limited the maximum partition size to 16 MB for 512 byte sectors and 4 KB clusters.

The &quot;BIOS Parameter Block&quot; (&quot;BPB&quot;) was introduced with PC DOS 2.0 as well, and this version also added read-only, archive, volume label, and directory attribute bits for hierarchical sub-directories.

MS-DOS 3.0 introduced support for high-density 1.2 MB 5.25-inch diskettes (media descriptor codice_10), which notably had 15 sectors per track, hence more space for the FATs.

FAT12 remains in use on all common floppy disks, including 1.44 MB and later 2.88 MB disks (media descriptor byte codice_11).

=== Initial FAT16 ===
In 1984, IBM released the PC AT, which required PC DOS 3.0 to access its 20 MB hard disk. Microsoft introduced MS-DOS 3.0 in parallel. Cluster addresses were increased to 16-bit, allowing for up to 65,526 clusters per volume. However, the maximum possible number of sectors and the maximum partition size of 32 MB did not change. Although cluster addresses were 16 bits, this format was not what today is commonly understood as FAT16.
A partition type codice_12 indicates this form of FAT16 with less than 65,536 sectors (less than 32 MB for sector size 512). The benefit of FAT16 was the use of smaller clusters, making disk usage more efficient, particularly for large numbers of files only a few hundred bytes in size.

As MS-DOS 3.0 formatted all 16 MB-32 MB partitions in the FAT16 format, a 20 MB hard disk formatted under MS-DOS 3.0 was not accessible by MS-DOS 2.0. MS-DOS 3.0 to MS-DOS 3.30 could still access FAT12 partitions under 15 MB, but required all 16 MB-32 MB partitions to be FAT16, and so could not access MS-DOS 2.0 partitions in this size range. MS-DOS 3.31 and higher could access 16 MB-32 MB FAT12 partitions again.

=== Logical sectored FAT ===

MS-DOS and PC DOS implementations of FAT12 and FAT16 could not access disk partitions larger than 32 megabytes. Several manufacturers developed their own FAT variants within their OEM versions of MS-DOS.

Some vendors (AST and NEC) supported eight, instead of the standard four, primary partition entries in their custom extended &quot;Master Boot Record&quot; (&quot;MBR&quot;), and they adapted MS-DOS to use more than a single primary partition.

Other vendors worked around the volume size limits imposed by the 16-bit sector entries by increasing the apparent &quot;size&quot; of the sectors the file system operated on. These &quot;logical sectors&quot; were larger (up to 8192 bytes) than the &quot;physical sector&quot; size (still 512 bytes) on the disk. The DOS-BIOS or System BIOS would then combine multiple physical sectors into logical sectors for the file system to work with.

These changes were transparent to the file system implementation in the DOS kernel. The underlying DOS-BIOS translated these logical sectors into physical sectors according to partitioning information and the drive&#x27;s physical geometry.

The drawback of this approach was increased memory used for sector buffering and deblocking. Since older DOS versions could not use large logical sectors, the OEMs introduced new partition IDs for their FAT variants in order to hide them from off-the-shelf issues of MS-DOS and PC DOS. Known partition IDs for logical sectored FATs include: codice_13 (Commodore MS-DOS 3.x), codice_14 (Leading Edge MS-DOS 3.x), codice_15 (AST MS-DOS 3.x), codice_16 (NEC MS-DOS 3.30), codice_17 (AT&amp;T MS-DOS 3.x), codice_18 (Tandy MS-DOS), codice_19 (Sperry IT MS-DOS 3.x, Unisys MS-DOS 3.3 – also used by Digital Research DOS Plus 2.1). OEM versions like Toshiba MS-DOS, Wyse MS-DOS 3.2 and 3.3, as well as Zenith MS-DOS are also known to have utilized logical sectoring.

While non-standard and sub-optimal, these FAT variants are perfectly valid according to the specifications of the file system itself. Therefore, even if default issues of MS-DOS and PC DOS were not able to cope with them, most of these vendor-specific FAT12 and FAT16 variants can be mounted by more flexible file system implementations in operating systems such as DR-DOS, simply by changing the partition ID to one of the recognized types. Also, if they no longer need to be recognized by their original operating systems, existing partitions can be &quot;converted&quot; into FAT12 and FAT16 volumes more compliant with versions of MS-DOS/PC DOS 4.0–6.3, which do not support sector sizes different from 512 bytes, by switching to a BPB with 32-bit entry for the number of sectors, as introduced since DOS 3.31 (see FAT16B below), keeping the cluster size and reducing the logical sector size in the BPB down to 512 bytes, while at the same time increasing the counts of logical sectors per cluster, reserved logical sectors, total logical sectors, and logical sectors per FAT by the same factor.

A parallel development in MS-DOS / PC DOS which allowed an increase in the maximum possible FAT size was the introduction of multiple FAT partitions on a hard disk. To allow the use of more FAT partitions in a compatible way, a new partition type was introduced in PC DOS 3.2 (1986), the &quot;extended partition&quot; (EBR), which is a container for an additional partition called &quot;logical drive&quot;. Since PC DOS 3.3 (April 1987), there is another, optional extended partition containing the next &quot;logical drive&quot;, and so on. The MBR of a hard disk can either define up to four primary partitions, or an extended partition in addition to up to three primary partitions.

=== Final FAT16 ===
In November 1987, Compaq Personal Computer DOS 3.31 (a modified OEM version of MS-DOS 3.3 released by Compaq with their machines) introduced what today is simply known as &quot;the FAT16&quot; format, with the expansion of the 16-bit disk sector count to 32 bits in the BPB.
Although the on-disk changes were minor, the entire DOS disk driver had to be converted to use 32-bit sector numbers, a task complicated by the fact that it was written in 16-bit assembly language.
The result was initially called the &quot;DOS 3.31 Large File System&quot;. Microsoft&#x27;s codice_20 tool refers to type codice_21 as &quot;BigFAT&quot;, whereas some older versions of codice_22 described it as &quot;BIGDOS&quot;. Technically, it is known as FAT16B.

Since older versions of DOS were not designed to cope with more than 65,535 sectors, it was necessary to introduce a new partition type for this format in order to hide it from pre-3.31 issues of DOS. The original form of FAT16 (with less than 65,536 sectors) had a partition type codice_12. To deal with disks larger than this, type codice_21 was introduced to indicate 65,536 or more sectors. In addition to this, the disk driver was expanded to cope with more than 65,535 sectors as well. The only other difference between the original FAT16 and the newer FAT16B format is the usage of a newer BPB format with 32-bit sector entry. Therefore, newer operating systems supporting the FAT16B format can cope also with the original FAT16 format without any necessary changes.

If partitions to be used by pre-DOS 3.31 issues of DOS need to be created by modern tools, the only criteria theoretically necessary to meet are a sector count of less than 65536, and the usage of the old partition ID (codice_12). In practice however, type codice_26 and codice_12 primary partitions should not be physically located outside the first 32 MB of the disk, due to other restrictions in MS-DOS 2.x, which could not cope with them otherwise.

In 1988, the FAT16B improvement became more generally available through DR DOS 3.31, PC DOS 4.0, OS/2 1.1, and MS-DOS 4.0. The limit on partition size was dictated by the 8-bit signed count of sectors per cluster, which originally had a maximum power-of-two value of 64. With the standard hard disk sector size of 512 bytes, this gives a maximum of 32 KB cluster size, thereby fixing the &quot;definitive&quot; limit for the FAT16 partition size at 2 GB for sector size 512. On magneto-optical media, which can have 1 or 2 KB sectors instead of 0.5 KB, this size limit is proportionally larger.

Much later, Windows NT increased the maximum cluster size to 64 KB, by considering the sectors-per-cluster count as unsigned. However, the resulting format was not compatible with any other FAT implementation of the time, and it generated greater internal fragmentation. Windows 98, SE and ME also supported reading and writing this variant, but its disk utilities did not work with it and some FCB services are not available for such volumes. This contributes to a confusing compatibility situation.

Prior to 1995, versions of DOS accessed the disk via CHS addressing only. When Windows 95(MS-DOS 7.0) introduced LBA disk access, partitions could start being physically located outside the first c. 8 GB of this disk and thereby out of the reach of the traditional CHS addressing scheme. Partitions partially or fully located beyond the CHS barrier therefore had to be hidden from non-LBA-enabled operating systems by using the new partition type codice_28 in the partition table instead. FAT16 partitions using this partition type are also named FAT16X. The only difference, compared to previous FAT16 partitions, is the fact that some CHS-related geometry entries in the BPB record, namely the number of sectors per track and the number of heads, may contain no or misleading values and should not be used.

The number of root directory entries available for FAT12 and FAT16 is determined when the volume is formatted, and is stored in a 16-bit field. For a given number codice_29 and sector size codice_30, the number codice_31 of root directory sectors is codice_32, and codice_29 is normally chosen to fill these sectors, i.e., codice_34. FAT12 and FAT16 media typically use 512 root directory entries on non-floppy media. Some third-party tools, like mkdosfs, allow the user to set this parameter.

===FAT32===
In order to overcome the volume size limit of FAT16, while at the same time allowing DOS real-mode code to handle the format, Microsoft designed a new version of the file system, FAT32, which supported an increased number of possible clusters, but could reuse most of the existing code, so that the conventional memory footprint was increased by less than 5 KB under DOS. Cluster values are represented by 32-bit numbers, of which 28 bits are used to hold the cluster number.

==== Maximal sizes ====
The FAT32 boot sector uses a 32-bit field for the sector count, limiting the maximal FAT32 volume size to 2 terabytes with a sector size of 512 bytes. The maximum FAT32 volume size is 16 TB with a sector size of 4,096 bytes. The built-in Windows shell disk format tool on Windows NT arbitrarily only supports volume sizes up to 32 GB, but Windows supports reading and writing to preexisting larger FAT32 volumes, and these can be created with the command prompt, PowerShell or third-party tools, or by formatting the volume on a non-Windows system or on a Windows 9x system with FAT32 support and then transferring it to the Windows NT system. In August 2024, Microsoft released an update to Windows 11 preview builds that allows for the creation of FAT32 partitions up to 2TB in size. 

The maximal possible size for a file on a FAT32 volume is 4 GiB minus 1 byte, or 4,294,967,295 (232 − 1) bytes. This limit is a consequence of the 4-byte file length entry in the directory table and would also affect relatively huge FAT16 partitions enabled by a sufficient sector size.

Like FAT12 and FAT16, FAT32 does not include direct built-in support for long filenames, but FAT32 volumes can optionally hold VFAT long filenames in addition to short filenames in exactly the same way as VFAT long filenames have been optionally implemented for FAT12 and FAT16 volumes.

==== Development ====
FAT32 was introduced with Windows 95 OSR2(MS-DOS 7.1) in 1996, although reformatting was needed to use it, and DriveSpace 3 (the version that came with Windows 95 OSR2 and Windows 98) never supported it. Windows 98 introduced a utility to convert existing hard disks from FAT16 to FAT32 without loss of data.

In the Windows NT line, native support for FAT32 arrived in Windows 2000. A free FAT32 driver for Windows NT 4.0 was available from Winternals, a company later acquired by Microsoft. The acquisition of the driver from official sources is no longer possible. Since 1998, Caldera&#x27;s dynamically loadable DRFAT32 driver could be used to enable FAT32 support in DR-DOS. The first version of DR-DOS to natively support FAT32 and LBA access was OEM DR-DOS 7.04 in 1999. That same year IMS introduced native FAT32 support with REAL/32 7.90, and IBM 4690 OS added FAT32 support with version 2. Ahead Software provided another dynamically loadable FAT32.EXE driver for DR-DOS 7.03 with Nero Burning ROM in 2004. IBM introduced native FAT32 support with OEM PC DOS 7.1 in 1999.

Two partition types have been reserved for FAT32 partitions, codice_35 and codice_36. The latter type is also named FAT32X in order to indicate usage of LBA disk access instead of CHS. On such partitions, CHS-related geometry entries, namely the CHS sector addresses in the MBR as well as the number of sectors per track and the number of heads in the EBPB record, may contain no or misleading values and should not be used.

== Extensions ==
=== Extended attributes ===

OS/2 heavily depends on extended attributes (EAs) and stores them in a hidden file called &quot;codice_37&quot; in the root directory of the FAT12 or FAT16 volume. This file is indexed by two previously reserved bytes in the file&#x27;s (or directory&#x27;s) directory entry at offset codice_38. In the FAT32 format, these bytes hold the upper 16 bits of the starting cluster number of the file or directory, hence making it impossible to store OS/2 EAs on FAT32 using this method.

However, the third-party FAT32 installable file system (IFS) driver FAT32.IFS version 0.70 and higher by Henk Kelder &amp; Netlabs for OS/2, eComStation and ArcaOS stores extended attributes in extra files with filenames having the string &quot;codice_39&quot; appended to the regular filename of the file to which they belong. The driver also utilizes the byte at offset codice_40 in directory entries to store a special mark byte indicating the presence of extended attributes to help speed up things. (This extension is critically incompatible with the FAT32+ method to store files larger than 4 GB minus 1 on FAT32 volumes.)

Extended attributes are accessible via the Workplace Shell desktop, through REXX scripts, and many system GUI and command-line utilities (such as 4OS2).

To accommodate its OS/2 subsystem, Windows NT supports the handling of extended attributes in HPFS, NTFS, FAT12 and FAT16. It stores EAs on FAT12, FAT16 and HPFS using exactly the same scheme as OS/2, but does not support any other kind of ADS as held on NTFS volumes. Trying to copy a file with any ADS other than EAs from an NTFS volume to a FAT or HPFS volume gives a warning message with the names of the ADSs that will be lost. It does not support the FAT32.IFS method to store EAs on FAT32 volumes.

Windows 2000 onward acts exactly as Windows NT, except that it ignores EAs when copying to FAT32 without any warning (but shows the warning for other ADSs, like &quot;Macintosh Finder Info&quot; and &quot;Macintosh Resource Fork&quot;).

Cygwin uses &quot;codice_37&quot; files as well.

=== Long file names ===
One of the user experience goals for the designers of Windows 95 was the ability to use long filenames (LFNs—up to 255 UTF-16 code units long), in addition to classic 8.3 filenames (SFNs). For backward and forward compatibility, LFNs were implemented as an optional extension on top of the existing FAT file system structures using a workaround in the way directory entries are laid out.

This transparent method to store long file names in the existing FAT file systems without altering their data structures is usually known as VFAT (for &quot;Virtual FAT&quot;) after the Windows 95 virtual device driver.

Non VFAT-enabled operating systems can still access the files under their short file name alias without restrictions; however, the associated long file names may be lost when files with long filenames are copied under non VFAT-aware operating systems.

In Windows NT, support for VFAT long filenames began with version 3.5.

Linux provides a VFAT filesystem driver to work with FAT volumes with VFAT long filenames. For some time, a UVFAT driver was available to provide combined support for UMSDOS-style permissions with VFAT long filenames.

OS/2 added long filename support to FAT using extended attributes (EA) before the introduction of VFAT. Thus, VFAT long filenames are invisible to OS/2, and EA long filenames are invisible to Windows; therefore, experienced users of both operating systems would have to manually rename the files.

Human68K supported up to 18.3 filenames and (Shift JIS) Kanji characters in a proprietary FAT file system variant.

In order to support Java applications, the FlexOS-based IBM 4690 OS version 2 introduced its own virtual file system (VFS) architecture to store long filenames in the FAT file system in a backwards-compatible fashion. If enabled, the virtual filenames (VFN) are available under separate logical drive letters, whereas the real filenames (RFN) remain available under the original drive letters.

=== Forks and alternate data streams ===

The FAT file system itself is not designed for supporting alternate data streams (ADS), but some operating systems that heavily depend on them have devised various methods for handling them on FAT volumes. Such methods either store the additional information in extra files and directories (classic Mac OS and macOS), or give new semantics to previously unused fields of the FAT on-disk data structures (OS/2 and Windows NT).

Mac OS using PC Exchange stores its various dates, file attributes and long filenames in a hidden file called &quot;codice_42&quot;, and resource forks (a common Mac OS ADS) in a subdirectory called &quot;codice_43&quot;, in every directory where they are used. From PC Exchange 2.1 onwards, they store the Mac OS long filenames as standard FAT long filenames and convert FAT filenames longer than 31 characters to unique 31-character filenames, which can then be made visible to Macintosh applications.

macOS stores resource forks and metadata (file attributes, other ADS) using AppleDouble format in a hidden file with a name constructed from the owner filename prefixed with &quot;codice_44&quot;, and Finder stores some folder and file metadata in a hidden file called &quot;codice_45&quot; (but note that Finder uses codice_46 even on macOS&#x27; native filesystem, HFS+).

=== UMSDOS permissions and filenames ===
Early Linux distributions also supported a format known as UMSDOS, a FAT variant with Unix file attributes (such as long file name and access permissions) stored in a separate file called &quot;codice_47&quot;. UMSDOS fell into disuse after VFAT was released and it is not enabled by default in Linux from version 2.5.7 onwards. For some time, Linux also provided combined support for UMSDOS-style permissions and VFAT long filenames through UVFAT.

=== FAT+ ===
In 2007 the open FAT+ draft proposed how to store larger files up to 256 GB minus 1 byte, or 274,877,906,943 (238 − 1) bytes, on slightly modified and otherwise backward-compatible FAT32 volumes, but imposes a risk that disk tools or FAT32 implementations not aware of this extension may truncate or delete files exceeding the normal FAT32 file size limit. Support for FAT32+ and FAT16+ is limited to some versions of DR-DOS and not available in mainstream operating systems. (This extension is critically incompatible with the codice_48 option of the FAT32.IFS method to store OS/2 extended attributes on FAT32 volumes.)

== Derivatives ==

=== Turbo FAT ===
In its NetWare File System (NWFS) Novell implemented a heavily modified variant of a FAT file system for the NetWare operating system. For larger files it utilized a performance feature named Turbo FAT.

=== FATX ===

FATX is a family of file systems designed for Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox video game console hard disk drives and memory cards, introduced in 2001.

While resembling the same basic design ideas as FAT16 and FAT32, the FATX16 and FATX32 on-disk structures are simplified, but fundamentally incompatible with normal FAT16 and FAT32 file systems, making it impossible for normal FAT file system drivers to mount such volumes.

The non-bootable superblock sector is 4 KB in size and holds an 18 byte large BPB-like structure completely different from normal BPBs. Clusters are typically 16 KB in size and there is only one copy of the FAT on the Xbox. Directory entries are 64 bytes in size instead of the normal 32 bytes. Files can have filenames up to 42 characters long using the OEM character set and be up to 4 GB minus 1 byte in size. The on-disk timestamps hold creation, modification and access dates and times but differ from FAT: in FAT, the epoch is 1980; in FATX, the epoch is 2000. On the Xbox 360, the epoch is 1980.

=== exFAT ===
exFAT is a file system introduced with Windows Embedded CE 6.0 in November 2006 and brought to the Windows NT family with Vista Service Pack 1 and Windows XP Service Pack 3 (or separate installation of Windows XP Update KB955704). It is loosely based on the File Allocation Table architecture, but incompatible, proprietary and protected by patents.

exFAT is intended for use on flash drives and memory cards such as SDXC and Memory Stick XC, where FAT32 is otherwise used. Vendors usually pre-format SDXC cards with it. Its main benefit is its exceeding of the 4 GB file size limit, as file size references are stored with eight instead of four bytes, increasing the limit to 264 − 1 bytes.

Microsoft&#x27;s GUI and command-line format utilities offer it as an alternative to NTFS (and, for smaller partitions, to FAT16B and FAT32). The MBR partition type is codice_49 (the same as used for IFS, HPFS, and NTFS). Logical geometry information located in the VBR is stored in a format not resembling any kind of BPB.

In early 2010, the file system was reverse-engineered by the SANS Institute. On August 28, 2019, Microsoft published the technical specification for exFAT so that it can be used in the Linux kernel and other operating systems.

== Patents ==

Microsoft applied for, and was granted, a series of patents for key parts of the FAT file system in the mid-1990s. All four pertain to long-filename extensions to FAT first seen in Windows 95: U.S. patent 5,579,517, U.S. patent 5,745,902, U.S. patent 5,758,352, U.S. patent 6,286,013 (all expired since 2013).

On December 3, 2003, Microsoft announced that it would be offering licenses for use of its FAT specification and &quot;associated intellectual property&quot;, at the cost of a royalty per unit sold, with a maximum royalty per license agreement. To this end, Microsoft cited four patents on the FAT file system as the basis of its intellectual property claims.

In the EFI FAT32 specification, Microsoft specifically grants a number of rights, which many readers have interpreted as permitting operating system vendors to implement FAT. Non-Microsoft patents affecting FAT include: U.S. patent 5,367,671, specific to the OS/2 extended object attributes (expired in 2011).

=== Challenges and lawsuits ===
The Public Patent Foundation (PUBPAT) submitted evidence to the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) in 2004 disputing the validity of U.S. patent 5,579,517, including prior art references from Xerox and IBM. The USPTO opened an investigation and concluded by rejecting all claims in the patent. The next year, the USPTO further announced that following the re-examination process, it affirmed the rejection of &#x27;517 and additionally found U.S. patent 5,758,352 invalid on the grounds that the patent had incorrect assignees.

However, in 2006, the USPTO ruled that features of Microsoft&#x27;s implementation of the FAT system were &quot;novel and non-obvious&quot;, reversing both earlier decisions and leaving the patents valid.

In February 2009, Microsoft filed a patent infringement lawsuit against TomTom alleging that the device maker&#x27;s products infringe on patents related to VFAT long filenames. As some TomTom products are based on Linux, this marked the first time that Microsoft tried to enforce its patents against the Linux platform. The lawsuit was settled out of court the following month with an agreement that Microsoft be given access to four of TomTom&#x27;s patents, that TomTom will drop support for the VFAT long filenames from its products, and that in return Microsoft not seek legal action against TomTom for the five-year duration of the settlement agreement.

In October 2010, Microsoft filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Motorola alleging several patents (including two of the VFAT patents) were not licensed for use in the Android operating system. They also submitted a complaint to the ITC.
Developers of open source software have designed methods intended to circumvent Microsoft&#x27;s patents.

In 2013, patent EP0618540 &quot;common name space for long and short filenames&quot; (expired since 2014) was invalidated in Germany. After the appeal was withdrawn, this judgment became final on the 28th October 2015.

<text>Dame Joan Henrietta Collins (born 23 May 1933) is an English actress, author and columnist. Active in film and television since the 1950s, she portrayed the glamorous schemer Alexis Colby in the soap opera &quot;Dynasty&quot; (1981–1989). She is known for her roles in cult films including &quot;Land of the Pharaohs&quot; (1955), &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; (1972), &quot;Empire of the Ants&quot; (1977) and &quot;The Stud&quot; (1978) and for television appearances in &quot;Star Trek&quot; (1967), &quot;Tales of the Unexpected&quot; (1979, 1980), &quot;Benidorm&quot; (2014–2017) and &quot;American Horror Story: Apocalypse&quot; (2018).

Collins trained as an actress at RADA and made her film debut in 1951. After going under contract to 20th Century Fox, she starred as Evelyn Nesbit in &quot;The Girl in the Red Velvet Swing&quot;, Elizabeth Raleigh in &quot;The Virgin Queen&quot; (both 1955) and Esther in the epic &quot;Esther and the King&quot; (1960). In the 1970s, she appeared in several British horror films including &quot;Fear in the Night&quot; (1972), &quot;Dark Places&quot; (1973) and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Be Born&quot; (1975). Her part as Fontaine Khaled in &quot;The Stud&quot; and its 1979 sequel &quot;The Bitch&quot; led her to be cast in &quot;Dynasty&quot;; for her role as Alexis Colby, she won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Television Series – Drama in 1982. In the 2000s, Collins notably appeared in &quot;The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas&quot; (2000) and the TV movie &quot;These Old Broads&quot; (2001) alongside Elizabeth Taylor, Debbie Reynolds and Shirley MacLaine. She made her comeback to mainstream television in the 2010s, taking on recurring roles in series including &quot;Happily Divorced&quot; (2011–2013) and &quot;The Royals&quot; (2014–2018). Her first starring film role since the 1980s was &quot;The Time of Their Lives&quot; (2017), and she has also appeared in various independent films including &quot;Gerry&quot; (2018).

Collins is the recipient of several accolades, including a Golden Globe Award, a People&#x27;s Choice Award, two Soap Opera Digest Awards and a Primetime Emmy Award nomination. She was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1983 and was made a Dame by Queen Elizabeth II for her charitable services in 2015.

==Early life==
Collins was born in Paddington, London on 23 May 1933, and brought up in Maida Vale, the daughter of Elsa Collins (née Bessant), a dance teacher, and Joseph William Collins, a talent agent (whose clients would later include Shirley Bassey, the Beatles and Tom Jones). Her father, a native of South Africa, was Jewish, and her British mother was Anglican. She had two younger siblings, Jackie, a novelist, and Bill, a property agent. She was educated at the Francis Holland School, an independent day school for girls in London. Collins made her stage debut in the Henrik Ibsen play &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot; at the age of nine, and at the age of 16 trained as an actress at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in London. At the age of 17, Collins was signed to the Rank Organisation, a British film studio.

==Acting career==

=== 1950s ===

After signing with Rank, Collins appeared in many British films. Her feature debut as a film extra playing a beauty contestant in &quot;Lady Godiva Rides Again&quot; (1951) which featured Diana Dors. Collins followed up with &quot;The Woman&#x27;s Angle&quot; (1952) a minor role as a Greek maid. Next was a more significant role as a gangster&#x27;s moll in &quot;Judgment Deferred&quot; (1952).

Collins&#x27;s big break came with a major, highly publicised role as a juvenile delinquent in &quot;I Believe in You&quot; (1952). Her success in the part led to her initial stardom and the press nickname &quot;Britain&#x27;s Bad Girl&quot;. Her subsequent films whilst under contract to Rank included &quot;Decameron Nights&quot; (1953) with Joan Fontaine; England&#x27;s first X certificate drama, &quot;Cosh Boy&quot; (1953), directed by Lewis Gilbert; &quot;Turn the Key Softly&quot; (1953), a drama about three women released from prison on the same day; and the boxing saga &quot;The Square Ring&quot; (1953).

Collins was top-billed in the desert island comedy &quot;Our Girl Friday&quot; (1953), co starring Kenneth More. She was directed again by Lewis Gilbert in &quot;The Good Die Young&quot; (1954) with Laurence Harvey and Gloria Grahame. Between films, she appeared in several plays in London including &quot;The Seventh Veil&quot; (1952), &quot;Jassy&quot; (1952), &quot;Claudia and David&quot; (1954), and &quot;The Skin of Our Teeth&quot; (1954), as well as a UK tour of &quot;The Praying Mantis&quot; (1953).
In 1954, Collins was chosen by American director Howard Hawks to star as the scheming Princess Nellifer in her first international production, &quot;Land of the Pharaohs&quot;. The lavish Warner Brothers historical epic was unsuccessful upon release but has been lauded by Martin Scorsese and French critics supporting the auteur theory for numerous elements of its physical production. Danny Peary in his book &quot;Cult Movies&quot; (1981), selected it as a cult classic. Collins&#x27;s sultry performance so impressed 20th Century Fox chief Darryl Zanuck that he signed the young star to a seven-year contract with the Hollywood studio.

Collins made her Hollywood film debut in the lavish historical drama &quot;The Virgin Queen&quot; (1955). The British newcomer was given equal billing with established stars Bette Davis and Richard Todd. The same year, Collins was cast in the starring role of Evelyn Nesbitt in &quot;The Girl in the Red Velvet Swing&quot; with Ray Milland and Farley Granger. The part had originally been intended for Marilyn Monroe, however problems between Monroe and Fox led to Collins gaining the role.

MGM borrowed Collins for &quot;The Opposite Sex&quot; (1956), a musical remake of &quot;The Women&quot; (1939) in which she was cast as the gold digging Crystal, the role played by Joan Crawford in the original. She then starred as a young nun in &quot;Sea Wife&quot; (1956), top-billed over co-star Richard Burton, followed by the all-star &quot;Island in the Sun&quot; (1957), which was a major box-office success. The film earned $5,550,000 worldwide, and finished as the sixth-highest-grossing film of 1957. In 1957, she was top-billed over Jayne Mansfield in the film version of John Steinbeck&#x27;s &quot;The Wayward Bus&quot;, which despite disappointing reviews was nominated for the Golden Berlin Bear Award at the 7th Berlin International Film Festival. She then starred opposite Robert Wagner in the espionage thriller &quot;Stopover Tokyo&quot; (1957), and was Gregory Peck&#x27;s leading lady in the Western drama &quot;The Bravados&quot; (1958). The Leo McCarey comedy &quot;Rally Round the Flag, Boys&quot; (1958) cast Collins as a temptress out to seduce Paul Newman away from Joanne Woodward. Next came the tense crime caper &quot;Seven Thieves&quot; (1960) opposite Edward G. Robinson and Rod Steiger.

=== 1960s ===
In 1960, Collins became increasingly disillusioned with 20th Century Fox when, having been the original choice to play the title role in &quot;Cleopatra&quot;, the part went instead to Elizabeth Taylor. Collins withdrew from the studio&#x27;s production of &quot;Sons and Lovers&quot;, and requested a release from her contract, but agreed to star in one last film for Fox, top-billed again in the biblical epic &quot;Esther and the King&quot; (1960).

In 1961, she returned to London to star opposite Bing Crosby and Bob Hope in the last of that film duo&#x27;s &quot;road&quot; pictures, &quot;The Road to Hong Kong&quot; (1962). Former &quot;road&quot; leading lady Dorothy Lamour was relegated to a guest appearance in the film. In Italy, Collins starred in &quot;Hard Time for Princes&quot; (1965); back in the US she played David Janssen&#x27;s wife in the detective thriller &quot;Warning Shot&quot; (1967); in the UK she was the leading lady in the spy caper &quot;Subterfuge&quot; (1968); and made a cameo appearance in the comedy &quot;If It&#x27;s Tuesday, This Must Be Belgium&quot; (1969).

In the US, Collins starred opposite her husband Anthony Newley in his autobiographical musical &quot;Can Heironymus Merkin Ever Forget Mercy Humppe and Find True Happiness?&quot; (1969), a decision she later regretted. Then came the female lead in the Italian drama &quot;L&#x27;amore brave&quot; (1969), &quot;The Executioner&quot; (1970), a thriller with George Peppard, and &quot;Up in the Cellar&quot; (1970), a quasisequel to &quot;Three in the Attic&quot;. Although she had made several appearances on interview and game shows in the late 1950s and early 1960s, Collins began her television dramatic career with a guest role in &quot;The Human Jungle&quot; in 1963. Her notable appearances on American television during the 1960s included playing the villainous Siren in &quot;Batman&quot;, &quot;Run For Your Life&quot;, &quot;The Virginian&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;The Man From U.N.C.L.E.&quot;, and in &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot;, she played Edith Keeler in the episode, &quot;The City on the Edge of Forever&quot; (1967).

=== 1970s ===
In the 1970s, Collins remained busy on television. She starred in the TV movies &quot;The Man Who Came to Dinner&quot; (1972) with Orson Welles and Lee Remick, and &quot;Drive Hard, Drive Fast&quot; (1973) opposite Brian Kelly. Her many guest appearances during the decade included &quot;The Persuaders!&quot; alongside Roger Moore and Tony Curtis, &quot;Fallen Angels&quot; with Susannah York, &quot;Space 1999&quot;, &quot;Orson Welles Great Mysteries&quot;, &quot;Police Woman&quot;, &quot;The Moneychangers&quot; with Kirk Douglas and Christopher Plummer, &quot;Starsky and Hutch&quot;, &quot;Tattletales&quot;, &quot;Switch&quot;, &quot;Future Cop&quot;, &quot;Ellery Queen&quot;, &quot;The Fantastic Journey&quot;, &quot;Baretta&quot; and three separate episodes of &quot;Tales of the Unexpected&quot;. She rounded off the decade playing Cleopatra in an episode of Aaron Spelling&#x27;s &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;.
In 1970, Collins returned to Britain and starred in several films, mostly thrillers and horror films: &quot;Revenge&quot; (1971), as the vengeance-seeking mother of a murdered child; &quot;Quest for Love&quot; (1971), a romantic science-fiction piece; &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; (1972), a highly successful horror anthology; &quot;Fear in the Night&quot; (1972), a psychological horror from Jimmy Sangster; &quot;Dark Places&quot; (1973), a thriller with Christopher Lee; and &quot;Tales That Witness Madness&quot; (1973), another horror anthology. She went to Italy for the football-themed comedy &quot;L&#x27;arbitro&quot; (1974), to Spain for &quot;The Great Adventure&quot; opposite Jack Palance and returned to England for yet another horror, playing the mother of a murderous infant in &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Be Born&quot; (1975).

After two comedies, &quot;Alfie Darling&quot; (1975) and &quot;The Bawdy Adventures of Tom Jones&quot; (1976), Collins returned to the US to make what she now refers to as the nadir of her film career, the giant insect science-fiction piece &quot;Empire of the Ants&quot; (1977). In Italy she was the leading lady in the thriller &quot;Fearless&quot; (1978); in the US made the lighthearted &quot;Zero to Sixty&quot; (1978); and back in the UK appeared with Robert Mitchum in &quot;The Big Sleep&quot;.

In 1978, Collins was catapulted back to major stardom in the UK when she starred in the film version of her sister Jackie Collins&#x27;s racy novel &quot;The Stud&quot;. It was made for $600,000 and went on to gross over $20,000,000 internationally. At the same time she published her autobiography, &quot;Past Imperfect&quot;, which went to number 1 in the bestseller charts. &quot;The Stud&quot; was so successful that a sequel, &quot;The Bitch&quot; (1979) was hastily arranged and was also a hit. After shooting &quot;Game for Vultures&quot; (1979) opposite Richard Harris and &quot;Sunburn&quot; (1979) with Farrah Fawcett, Collins returned to the stage for the first time in many years to play the title role in &quot;The Last of Mrs. Cheyney&quot; (1980) in London&#x27;s West End.

=== 1980s ===
The success of &quot;The Stud&quot; and &quot;The Bitch&quot; helped Collins to be cast in the second season of the then-struggling soap opera &quot;Dynasty&quot; (1981–89), as Alexis Colby, the beautiful and vengeful ex-wife of oil tycoon Blake Carrington (John Forsythe). &quot;Dynasty&quot; became an enormous worldwide phenomenon, and by 1985 the programme was the number-one show in the United States, beating out CBS rival &quot;Dallas&quot;, which ranked number two. For her portrayal of Alexis, Collins was nominated six times for a Golden Globe Award (every year from 1982 to 1987), winning in 1983, the same year she was nominated for an Emmy as Best Actress in a Drama Series. In accepting the award, Collins thanked Sophia Loren for turning down the part of Alexis.

Her performance is generally credited as the chief factor in the fledgling show&#x27;s subsequent rise in the Nielsen ratings to a hit rivalling &quot;Dallas&quot;. Co-star Al Corley noted that Collins &quot;just flew&quot; in the role that was &quot;tailor made... just spot on.&quot; In &quot;Dynasty&quot; producer Aaron Spelling&#x27;s final press interview, he said of Collins: &quot;We didn&#x27;t write Joan Collins. She played Joan Collins. Am I right? We wrote a character, but the character could have been played by 50 people and 49 of them would have failed. She made it work.&quot; In recognition of her new status, in 1983 Collins was honoured with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for career achievement.

Whilst filming &quot;Dynasty&quot;, Collins starred in the feature film &quot;Nutcracker&quot; (1982) and the TV movies &quot;Paper Dolls&quot; (1982), &quot;The Wild Women of Chastity Gulch&quot; (1982), &quot;Making of a Male Model&quot; (1983) with Jon-Erik Hexum, &quot;Her Life as a Man&quot; (1984), and &quot;The Cartier Affair&quot; (1984) with David Hasselhoff. She made guest star appearances in &quot;The Love Boat&quot; and &quot;Faerie Tale Theatre&quot;, and co-hosted an ABC-TV special created for her, &quot;Blondes vs. Brunettes&quot;. At the age of 50, Collins appeared in a 12-page photo layout for &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine shot by George Hurrell. With &quot;Dynasty&quot; at the height of its success, Collins both produced and starred in the smash hit 1986 CBS miniseries &quot;Sins&quot;, and also in the same year, &quot;Monte Carlo&quot;.

=== 1990s ===
When &quot;Dynasty&quot; ended in 1989, Collins began rehearsals for her Broadway stage debut, as Amanda in a successful revival of Noël Coward&#x27;s &quot;Private Lives&quot; (1990). She subsequently toured the US in the same play and also starred as Amanda in a production in London&#x27;s West End. In 1991, she also starred for BBC Television in a series of eight individual Noël Coward plays under the title &quot;Tonight at 8.30&quot;. In 1991, Collins rejoined her co-stars for &quot;&quot;, a miniseries that concluded the cliffhanger ending left after the show&#x27;s abrupt 1989 cancellation. In the 1990s, Collins continued to star in films including &quot;Decadence&quot; (1994) and &quot;In The Bleak Midwinter&quot; (1995).

On American television she made the TV movies &quot;Hart to Hart – Two Harts in 3/4 Time&quot; (1995), &quot;&quot; (1995) and &quot;Sweet Deception&quot; (1998). She also made guest-star appearances on series such as &quot;Roseanne&quot; (1993), &quot;The Nanny&quot; (1996) and &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot; (2000), and played a recurring role in seven episodes of &quot;Pacific Palisades&quot; (1997). She was selected as the cover star for the relaunch of the popular celebrity magazine &quot;OK!&quot; when it changed from a monthly to a weekly. In 1999, Collins was cast in the film version of the musical theatre show &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, &quot; with Donny Osmond. She then starred opposite Nigel Hawthorne in the film &quot;The Clandestine Marriage&quot; (1999), which she also co-produced.

===2000s===

In 2000, Collins replaced Elizabeth Taylor as Pearl Slaghoople, Wilma Flintstone&#x27;s mother, in &quot;The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas&quot;, a prequel to the Universal Studios live-action film &quot;The Flintstones&quot; (1994, Taylor had originated the role in the first film). The following year, Collins co-starred with Taylor, Shirley MacLaine and Debbie Reynolds in the television film &quot;These Old Broads&quot;, written by Reynolds&#x27;s daughter, Carrie Fisher. In 2002, Collins returned to soap operas in a limited guest run on the American daytime soap &quot;Guiding Light&quot;. In 2005, actress Alice Krige impersonated Collins in &quot;&quot;, a fictionalised television film based on the creation and production of &quot;Dynasty&quot;.

In 2006, Collins toured the United Kingdom in &quot;An Evening with Joan Collins&quot; (US title &quot;One Night With Joan&quot;), a one-woman show in which she related the highs and lows of her career and life. The show was directed by her husband Percy Gibson, whom she married in 2002. She has continued to tour the world with the show and its sequel &quot;Joan Collins Unscripted&quot; ever since, including appearances in New York, Las Vegas, Dubai, Sydney, and twice at the London Palladium. In 2006–2007 she also toured North America for 30 weeks in the play &quot;Legends!&quot; with former &quot;Dynasty&quot; co-star Linda Evans.

In the mid-2000s, Collins&#x27;s television work included the hit British television series &quot;Footballer&#x27;s Wives&quot; as Eva de Wolffe (2005), the BBC series &quot;Hotel Babylon&quot; (2006) and &quot;Dynasty Reunion: Catfights and Caviar&quot;, a 2006 special featuring several of her &quot;Dynasty&quot; co-stars reminiscing about the original series. Collins guest-starred in &quot;They Do It with Mirrors&quot;, a two-hour episode of the murder-mystery drama &quot;Marple&quot; in 2009, as Ruth Van Rydock, a friend of detective Miss Jane Marple. In 2009, Collins presented her own reality television series entitled &quot;Joan Collins Does Glamour&quot;.

=== 2010s ===

In 2010 she joined the cast of the German soap opera &quot;Verbotene Liebe&quot; (&quot;Forbidden Love&quot;) for a short run, playing an aristocratic British woman, Lady Joan, who takes a young German prince in tow. Famed for her double act with Leonard Rossiter in the Cinzano advertisements, in 2012 she starred in a Europe-wide commercial for Snickers chocolate bars, alongside Stephanie Beacham. Within a short time the advert was re-edited and Beacham&#x27;s appearance cut.

She made her first (and, to date, only) venture into pantomime as Queen Rat in &quot;Dick Whittington&quot; at the Birmingham Hippodrome during the 2010 Christmas season, starring alongside Nigel Havers and Julian Clary. In 2012–2013, she appeared as herself in the US sitcom &quot;Happily Divorced&quot;. She also lent her voice to the animated feature film &quot;Saving Santa&quot; (2013).

From 2013 to 2017, Collins had a recurring guest role in the British sitcom &quot;Benidorm&quot; as Crystal Hennessy-Vass, the fierce CEO of the fictional Solana Hotel Group. From 2014 to 2018, she played the Grand Duchess of Oxford, mother of fictional British Queen Helena (Elizabeth Hurley) in the E! drama series &quot;The Royals&quot;. In 2015, Collins backed the children&#x27;s fairytales app GivingTales in aid of UNICEF, together with others such as Roger Moore, Ewan McGregor, Stephen Fry, Joanna Lumley, and Michael Caine. The same year she starred in the fantasy film &quot;Molly Moon and the Incredible Book of Hypnotism&quot;.

In 2016, Collins made a cameo appearance as herself in &quot;Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie&quot;. The following year she returned to the big screen with the starring role in the British comedy-drama &quot;The Time of Their Lives&quot;, playing a faded Hollywood star. In 2018 she appeared in a critically acclaimed short film, &quot;Gerry&quot;, for which she won the Best Actress award at the LA Shorts International Film Festival.

In 2018, Collins joined the cast of Ryan Murphy&#x27;s series &quot;American Horror Story&quot; for its eighth season &quot;American Horror Story: Apocalypse&quot;. She first portrayed Evie Gallant, the glamorous and rich grandmother of Evan Peters&#x27; character, and later portrayed witch actress Bubbles McGee. In 2019 she guest-starred in an episode of the new &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; TV-series.

=== 2020s ===
She had a co-starring role in the 2020 film &quot;The Loss Adjuster&quot; opposite Luke Goss and Martin Kemp. In 2021, Collins appeared in a short comedy spoof for Comic Relief entitled &quot;2020: The Movie&quot;, in which she played Maggie Keenan, the first person to receive a COVID-19 vaccination. Collins starred as Adelaide of Maurienne in the historical drama miniseries &quot;Glow and Darkness&quot; (2021), alongside Jane Seymour and Denise Richards. Collins had a role in the 2022 musical &quot;Tomorrow Morning&quot;, based on the acclaimed musical play of the same name.

=== Philanthropy ===

Collins has publicly supported several charities for several decades. In 1982, Collins spoke before the U.S. Congress about increasing funding for neurological research. In 1983, she was named a patron of the International Foundation for Children with Learning Disabilities, earning the foundation&#x27;s highest honour in 1988 for her continuing support. Additionally, 1988 also saw the opening of the Joan Collins Wing of the Children&#x27;s Hospital of Michigan in Detroit. In 1990, she was made an honorary founding member of the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.

In 1994, Collins was awarded the lifetime achievement award from the Association of Breast Cancer Studies in Great Britain for her contribution to breast cancer awareness in the UK. Collins is patron of Fight for Sight; in 2003, she became a patron of the Shooting Star Chase Children&#x27;s Hospice in Great Britain, while continuing to support several foster children in India, something she has done for the past 35 years. Collins serves her former school, the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, as the Honorary President of the RADA Associates.

=== Writing ===
Since the late 1990s, Collins has been a regular guest diarist for &quot;The Spectator&quot;. In 2008, she had a weekly opinions column in &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot;. She continues to write occasionally for the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and &quot;The Lady&quot; in the United Kingdom, and &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; in the United States.

Collins has established herself as a successful author, although doing so annoyed her sister Jackie, whose books had helped Joan&#x27;s career. In addition to her bestselling novels, including &quot;Prime Time&quot; and &quot;Love &amp; Desire &amp; Hate&quot;, she has also written six lifestyle books, including &quot;The Joan Collins Beauty Book&quot;, as well as memoirs, including &quot;Past Imperfect&quot;. To date, she has sold over 50 million copies of her books, which have been translated into 30 languages.

==Personal life==

=== Marriages and family ===
Collins has been married five times, first to Northern Irish actor Maxwell Reed, whom she married on 24 May 1952 after he date raped her. She divorced Reed on 29 May 1956. In 1959, Collins began a romance with the then-unknown actor Warren Beatty. They became engaged in 1960, but his infidelity led to their split the same year. Collins revealed in her 1978 autobiography that she got an abortion during the relationship.

On 27 May 1963, she married actor and singer-songwriter Anthony Newley, with whom she had two children, Tara (born 12 October 1963) and Alexander (born 8 September 1965). The couple divorced on 13 August 1971. She wed her third husband, American businessman Ron Kass on 11 March 1972, and the couple had a daughter, Katyana (born 20 June 1972). Collins and Kass divorced on 6 May 1983. She married former singer Peter Holm on 3 November 1985. Collins sought an annulment in December 1986, but was instead granted a divorce 24 August 1987. She married her fifth and current husband Percy Gibson, who is 32 years her junior, on 17 February 2002 at Claridge&#x27;s Hotel in London. Collins has four grandchildren. 

Collins&#x27;s younger sister was Jackie Collins, a bestselling English romance novelist, who died in September 2015. She wrote 32 novels, all of which appeared on &quot;The New York Times&quot; bestsellers list.

Collins maintains residences in Belgravia, Beverly Hills, and Saint-Tropez, describing her life in 2010 as being &quot;that of a gypsy&quot;. In 2019, Collins and Gibson escaped a &quot;terrifying&quot; fire at her London flat in Eaton Place. Gibson was able to contain the blaze using a fire extinguisher before the emergency services arrived. Collins was treated for smoke inhalation but was otherwise unharmed and thanked the emergency response crews on social media. In 2021, she sold her condo in New York for $2 million.

===Political views===
She was a supporter of the late Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, and was invited to attend her funeral on 17 April 2013. Collins is also a staunch monarchist, stating &quot;I&#x27;m a big monarchist and I love the Queen.&quot; In 2004, it was announced she had become a Patron of the UK Independence Party, though she later said this did not necessarily mean she would vote for the party. In 2013, Collins supported British withdrawal from the European Union.

==Honours==
Collins was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1997 New Year Honours for services to drama and advanced to Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2015 New Year Honours for services to charity.

<text>The University of Vienna () is a public research university located in Vienna, Austria. Founded by Duke Rudolph IV in 1365, it is the oldest university in the German-speaking world and among the largest institutions of higher learning in Europe. The university is associated with 17 Nobel Prize winners and has been the home to many scholars of historical and academic importance.

==History==
===Middle Ages to the Enlightenment===
The university was founded on March 12, 1365, by Rudolf IV, Duke of Austria, hence the name &quot;Alma Mater Rudolphina&quot;. After the Charles University in Prague (1347) and Jagiellonian University in Kraków (1364), the University of Vienna is the third oldest university in Central Europe and the oldest university in the contemporary German-speaking world; it remains a question of definition as the Charles University in Prague was German-speaking when founded, too. However, Pope Urban V did not ratify the deed of foundation that had been sanctioned by Rudolf IV, specifically in relation to the department of theology. This was presumably due to pressure exerted by Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor, who wished to avoid competition for the Charles University in Prague.

The pope later granted an endowment to the university in 1365, while papal assent was finally received in 1384. This led to the University of Vienna and its Faculty of Catholic Theology being granted the status of a full university. The first university building opened in 1385. It grew into the biggest university of the Holy Roman Empire, and during the advent of Humanism in the mid-15th century was home to more than 6,000 students.

In its early years, the university had a partly hierarchical, partly cooperative structure, in which the Rector was at the top, while the students had little say and were settled at the bottom. The Magister and Doctors constituted the four faculties and elected the academic officials from amidst their ranks. The students, but also all other Supposita (university members), were divided into four Academic Nations. Their elected board members, mostly graduates themselves, had the right to elect the Rector. He presided over the Consistory which included procurators of each of the nations and the faculty deans, as well as over the University Assembly, in which all university teachers participated. Complaints or appeals against decisions of the faculty by the students had to be brought forward by a Magister or Doctor.Being considered a Papal Institution, the university suffered a setback during the Reformation. In addition, epidemics, economic stagnation, and the first Siege of Vienna by Ottoman forces had devastating effects on the city, leading to a sharp decline in enrollment. For Emperor Ferdinand I, this meant that the university should be tied to the church to an even stronger degree, and in 1551 he installed the Jesuit Order there. As time went on, conflicts between the Jesuit school and the university arose. This led Emperor Ferdinand II, in 1623, to pass a law that incorporated the Jesuit College into the university. It was only in the mid-18th century that the Jesuits lost influence over the university and when Empress Maria Theresa ensured that the university went under the control of the monarchy. The university would later focus on the education of physicians and civil servants. Her successor Joseph II continued her reforms and further liberalized the university, abolishing official attire and allowing both Protestants and Jews to enroll by 1782, as well as introducing German as the compulsory language of instruction the year later.

===Modern history===

Significant changes were instituted in the wake of the Revolution in 1848, with the Philosophical Faculty being upgraded into equal status as Theology, Law and Medicine. Led by the reforms of Leopold, Count von Thun und Hohenstein, the university was able to achieve a larger degree of academic freedom. The current main building on the was built between 1877 and 1884 by Heinrich von Ferstel. The previous main building was located close to the &quot;Stuben&quot; Gate (Stubentor) on Iganz Seipel Square, the current home of the old University Church (&quot;Universitätskirche&quot;) and the Austrian Academy of Sciences (&quot;Österreichische Akademie der Wissenschaften&quot;). Women were admitted as full students in 1897, although their studies were limited to Philosophy. The remaining departments gradually followed suit, although with considerable delay: Medicine in 1900, Law in 1919, Protestant Theology in 1923, and finally Roman Catholic Theology in 1946. Ten years after the admission of the first female students, Elise Richter became the first woman to receive &quot;habilitation&quot;, becoming professor of Romance languages in 1907; she was also the first female distinguished professor.

In the late 1920s, the university was in steady turmoil because of anti-democratic and anti-Semitic activity by parts of the student body. Professor Moritz Schlick was killed by a former student while ascending the steps of the university for a class. His murderer was later released by the Nazi regime. Following the Anschluss, the annexation of Austria into Greater Germany by the Nazi regime, in 1938 the University of Vienna was reformed under political aspects, and a huge number of teachers and students were dismissed for political and &quot;racial&quot; reasons. In April 1945, the then 22-year-old Kurt Schubert, later acknowledged doyen of Judaic Studies at the University of Vienna, was permitted by the Soviet occupation forces to open the university again for teaching, which is why he is regarded as the unofficial first rector in the post-war period. On 25 April 1945, however, the constitutional lawyer Ludwig Adamovich senior was elected as the official rector of the University of Vienna. 

A large degree of participation by students and university staff was realized in 1975, however, the University Reforms of 1993 and 2002 largely re-established the professors as the main decision-makers. However, also as part of the 2002 reform, the university, after more than 250 years of being largely under governmental control, finally regained its full legal capacity. The number of faculties and centers was increased to 18, and the whole of the medical faculty was separated into the new Medical University of Vienna.

==Campus==
The University of Vienna does not have one single campus. Historically, the university started functioning from the First District near the Jesuit Church. Now, the academic facilities occupy more than sixty locations throughout the city of Vienna. The historical main building on the Ringstraße constitutes the university&#x27;s center and is commonly referred to as &quot;die Uni&quot;. Most other larger university facilities and lecture halls are located nearby in the area of Vienna&#x27;s First and Ninth District: the so-called new Lecture Hall Complex (Neues Institutgebäude, NIG), the lecture hall complex Althanstraße (UZA), the campus on the premises of the Historical General Hospital of Vienna, the Faculty of Law (Juridicum) and others. The Botanical Garden of the University of Vienna is housed in the Third District, as are the Department of Biochemistry and related research centers.

Also worth mentioning is the Vienna Observatory, which belongs to the university, and the Institute for University Sports (USI), which offers training and recreational possibilities to all students of the university. In addition, the University of Vienna maintains facilities outside of Vienna in the Austrian provinces of Lower Austria, Upper Austria, and Carinthia. These are mainly research and experimental departments for Biology, Astrophysics and Sports.

== Library ==
The University Library of the University of Vienna comprises the Main Library and the 50 departmental libraries at various university locations throughout Vienna. The library&#x27;s primary responsibility is to the members of the university; however, the library&#x27;s 350 staff members also provide access to the public. Use of the books in the reading halls is open to all persons without the need for identification, which is only required for checking out books. The library&#x27;s website provides direct access to information such as electronic journals, online indices, and databases.

=== History ===
Rudolf IV had already provided for a &quot;publica libraria&quot; in the Foundation Deed of 12 March 1365, where the valuable books bequeathed by deceased members of the university should be collected. Through many legacies, this collection was subsequently greatly increased and became the basis of the old &quot;Libreye&quot; that was accommodated in the same building as the student infirmary. In addition, there were libraries in the separate Faculties and in the Duke&#x27;s College.

From the 17th century onwards, interest in the old library, with its manuscripts and incunabulae, went into decline and the modern library in the Jesuit College came to the fore. In 1756, the oldest university library was finally closed down and its books, 2,787 volumes, were incorporated into the Court Library, of which Gerard van Swieten was then director. After the dissolution of the Jesuit order (1773), the new &quot;Academic Library&quot; was created out of the book collections of the five Lower Austrian Colleges and many duplicates from the Court Library. This was opened on 13 May 1777, the birthday of Maria Theresa of Austria, in the building of the Academic College. Initially, the stock consisted of some 45,000 books, and during Emperor Joseph II&#x27;s dissolution of the monasteries, this was soon considerably extended. In contrast to its antecedents, the new library was open to the general public. Between 1827 and 1829, it acquired the classicist extension (Postgasse 9) to the Academic College, in which it was to be accommodated until 1884. In this year, the main library, with some 300,000 books, moved to Heinrich von Ferstel&#x27;s new Main Building on the Ring, where stacks for some 500,000 volumes had already been prepared. With an annual growth of up to 30,000 volumes, the surplus space was soon filled. Book storage space had to be extended continuously. One hundred years later, the complete library, including departmental and subject libraries, comprised more than 4.3 million volumes. Today, Vienna&#x27;s University Library is the largest collection of books in Austria, still facing problems of space. In addition to the Main Library, which alone has to cope with an annual growth of 40,000 volumes, it includes three Faculty Libraries, 32 Subject Libraries and 26 Departmental Libraries.

==Organization==

The University of Vienna, like all universities and academies in Austria, once featured a system of democratic representation. Power in the university was divided equally among three groups: students (the largest group), junior faculty, and full professors. All groups had the right to send representatives to boards, who then voted on almost every issue. From 2002 on, the government of Austria, headed by chancellor Wolfgang Schüssel, reformed the university system, transforming the institutions into legal entities, but also concentrating power in the hands of the full professors. The reform also introduced a board of governors and tuition fees. In 2013, those amounted to about €381 per semester for students from Austria, the European Union as well as some non-EU countries, while students from developed non-EU countries usually pay double that amount. The reforms also separated the medical departments into separate medical schools, such as the Medical University of Vienna.

===Programmes===

Students at the university can select from 181 degree programs: 55 bachelor programs, 110 master programs, 3 diploma programs, and 13 doctoral programmes. In the academic year 2013/14, the university awarded 7,745 first degrees (Bachelors and Diplomas), 1,424 Master&#x27;s degrees, and 568 Doctoral degrees. The university offers a number of Master&#x27;s programs in English, including quantitative economics, management and finance, science-technology-society, environmental sciences, Middle European interdisciplinary master programme in cognitive science, European master in health and physical activity, English language and linguistics, Anglophone literature and culture, East Asian economy and society, economics, botany, ecology and ecosystems, molecular biology, microbial ecology and immunobiology, European master in urban studies, masters in European and international business law, mathematics, etc.

Some 6,900 scholars undertake research and teaching activities at the university. Of these, approximately 1,000 engage actively in projects financed by third parties. The main fields of research at the university cover a wide spectrum of subjects: Catholic and Protestant theology, law, economic sciences and computer science, philological-cultural studies and historical-cultural studies, social sciences and psychology, life sciences and natural sciences, mathematics, sports sciences, and teacher education.

<text>Pope Paul IV (; ; 28 June 1476 – 18 August 1559), born Gian Pietro Carafa, was head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 23 May 1555 to his death, in August 1559. While serving as papal nuncio in Spain, he developed an anti-Spanish outlook that later coloured his papacy. In response to an invasion of part of the Papal States by Spain during his papacy, he called for a French military intervention. After a defeat of the French and with Spanish troops at the edge of Rome, the Papacy and Spain reached a compromise: French and Spanish forces left the Papal States and the Pope thereafter adopted a neutral stance between France and Spain.

Carafa was appointed bishop of Chieti, but resigned in 1524 in order to found with Saint Cajetan the Congregation of Clerics Regular (Theatines). Recalled to Rome, and made Archbishop of Naples, he worked to re-organise the Inquisitorial system in response to the emerging Protestant movement in Europe, any dialogue with which he opposed (the inquisition itself had been first instituted by Pope Innocent III who first regulated inquisitional procedure in the 13th century). Carafa was elected pope in 1555 through the influence of Cardinal Alessandro Farnese in the face of opposition from Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. His papacy was characterised by strong nationalism in reaction to the influence of Philip II of Spain and the Habsburgs. The appointment of Carlo Carafa as Cardinal Nephew damaged the papacy further, and scandals forced Paul to remove him from office. He curbed some clerical abuses in Rome, but his methods were seen as harsh. He would introduce the first modern &quot;Index Librorum Prohibitorum&quot; or &quot;Index of Prohibited Books&quot; banning works he saw as in error. In spite of his advanced age, he was a tireless worker and issued new decrees and regulations daily, unrelenting in his determination to keep Protestants and recently immigrated Marranos from gaining influence in the Papal States. He had some hundred of the Marranos of Ancona thrown into prison; 50 were sentenced by the tribunal of the Inquisition and 25 of these were burned at the stake. Paul IV issued the Papal bull &quot;Cum nimis absurdum&quot;, which confined Jews in Rome to the neighbourhood &quot;claustro degli Ebrei&quot; (&quot;enclosure of the Hebrews&quot;), later known as the Roman Ghetto. He died highly unpopular, to the point that his family rushed his burial to make sure his body would not be desecrated by a popular uprising.

==Early life==
Gian Pietro Carafa was born in Capriglia Irpina, near Avellino, into the prominent Carafa family of Naples. His father Giovanni Antonio of the Counts Carafa della Stadera died in West Flanders in 1516 and his mother Vittoria Camponeschi was the daughter of Pietro Lalle Camponeschi, 5th Count of Montorio, a Neapolitan nobleman, and Maria de Noronha, a Portuguese noblewoman of the House of Pereira.

==Church career==

===Bishop===
He was mentored by Cardinal Oliviero Carafa, his relative, who resigned the see of Chieti (Latin &quot;Theate&quot;) in his favour. Under the direction of Pope Leo X, he was ambassador to England and then papal nuncio in Spain, where he conceived a violent detestation of Spanish rule that affected the policies of his later papacy.

In 1524, Pope Clement VII allowed Carafa to resign his benefices and join the ascetic and newly founded Congregation of Clerks Regular, popularly called the Theatines, after Carafa&#x27;s see of &quot;Theate.&quot; Following the sack of Rome in 1527, the order moved to Venice. But Carafa was recalled to Rome by the reform-minded Pope Paul III (1534–49), to sit on a committee of reform of the papal court, an appointment that forecasted an end to a humanist papacy and a revival of scholasticism, as Carafa was a disciple of Thomas Aquinas.

===Cardinal===
In December 1536 he was made Cardinal-Priest of &quot;S. Pancrazio&quot; and then Archbishop of Naples.

The Regensburg Colloquy in 1541 failed to achieve any measure of reconciliation between Catholics and Protestants in Europe, but instead saw a number of prominent Italians defect to the Protestant camp. In response, Carafa was able to persuade Pope Paul III to set up a Roman Inquisition, modelled on the Spanish Inquisition with himself as one of the Inquisitors-General. The Papal Bull was promulgated in 1542.

===Election as pope===

He was a surprise choice as pope to succeed Pope Marcellus II (1555); his severe and unbending character combined with his advanced age and Italian patriotism meant under normal circumstances he would have declined the honor. He accepted apparently because Emperor Charles V was opposed to his accession.

Carafa, elected on 23 May 1555, took the name of &quot;Paul IV&quot; in honor of Pope Paul III who named him as a cardinal. He was crowned as pope on 26 May 1555 by the protodeacon. He formally took possession of the Basilica of Saint John Lateran on 28 October 1555.

==Papacy==
As pope, Paul IV&#x27;s nationalism was a driving force; he used the office to preserve some liberties in the face of fourfold foreign occupation. Like Pope Paul III, he was an enemy of the Colonna family. His treatment of Giovanna d&#x27;Aragona, who had married into that family, drew further negative comment from Venice because she had long been a patron of artists and writers.

Paul IV was displeased at the French signing a five-year truce with Spain in February 1556 (in the midst of the Italian War of 1551–1559) and urged King Henry II of France to join the Papal States in an invasion of Spanish Naples. On 1 September 1556, King Philip II responded by preemptively invading the Papal States with 12,000 men under the Duke of Alba. French forces approaching from the north were defeated and forced to withdraw at Civitella del Tronto in August 1557. The Papal armies were left exposed and were defeated, with Spanish troops arriving at the edge of Rome. Out of fear of another sack of Rome, Paul IV agreed to the Duke of Alba&#x27;s demand for the Papal States to declare neutrality by signing the Peace of Cave-Palestrina on 12 September 1557. Emperor Charles V criticised the peace agreement as being overly generous to the Pope.

As cardinal-nephew, Carlo Carafa became his uncle&#x27;s chief political adviser. Having accepted a pension from the French, Cardinal Carafa worked to secure a French alliance. Carlo&#x27;s older brother Giovanni was made commander of the Papal forces and Duke of Paliano after the pro-Spanish Colonna were deprived of that town in 1556. Another nephew, Antonio, was given command of the Papal guard and made Marquis of Montebello. Their conduct became notorious in Rome. However, at the conclusion of the disastrous war with Philip II of Spain in the Italian War, and after many scandals, Paul IV publicly disgraced his nephews and banished them from Rome in 1559.

With the Protestant Reformation, the papacy required all Roman Catholic rulers to consider Protestant rulers as heretics, thus making their realms illegitimate. At the time of Paul&#x27;s election, Queen Mary I of England was two years into her reign, and was rolling back the English Reformation that had occurred under her half-brother Edward VI. Paul IV issued a papal bull in 1555, &quot;&quot;, removing all Church measures against the English government, and further recognising Mary and her husband Philip as King and Queen of Ireland, rather than merely being &quot;lord&quot;. Despite the bull, his relations with England were not positive. Paul IV had known Cardinal Reginald Pole while Pole was living in Italy and the two had been members of the spirituali together. Pole was the leader of Mary&#x27;s efforts, but Paul IV seems to have hated Pole and become convinced he was a crypto-Protestant. Combined with hostility towards Spain and thus Mary&#x27;s husband, Paul IV refused to allow any English bishops to be appointed, and began inquisitorial discipline proceedings against Pole, leading to the &quot;farcical&quot; situation that by 1558, the most serious opponent of English Catholicism was the Pope himself. He also angered people in England by insisting on the restitution of property confiscated during the dissolution of the monasteries. After Mary&#x27;s death, he rejected the succession of Elizabeth I of England to the throne.

Paul IV was violently opposed to the liberal Cardinal Giovanni Morone, whom he strongly suspected of being a hidden Protestant, so much that he had him imprisoned. In order to prevent Morone from succeeding him and imposing what he believed to be his Protestant beliefs on the Church, Pope Paul IV codified the Catholic Law excluding heretics and non-Catholics from receiving or legitimately becoming pope, in the bull &quot;Cum ex apostolatus officio&quot;.

Paul IV was rigidly orthodox, austere in life, and authoritarian in manner. He affirmed the Catholic doctrine of &quot;extra ecclesiam nulla salus&quot; (&#x27;outside the Church there is no salvation&#x27;), and used the Holy Office to suppress the Spirituali, a Catholic group deemed heretical. The strengthening of the Inquisition continued under Paul IV, and few could consider themselves safe by virtue of position in his drive to reform the Church; even cardinals he disliked could be imprisoned. He appointed inquisitor Michele Ghislieri, the future Pope Pius V, to the position of Supreme Inquisitor despite the fact as Inquisitor of Como, Ghislieri&#x27;s persecutions had inspired a citywide rebellion, forcing him to flee in fear for his life.
On 17 July 1555, Paul IV issued one of the most infamous papal bulls in Church history. The bull, &quot;Cum nimis absurdum&quot;, ordered the creation of a Jewish ghetto in Rome. The Pope set its borders near the Rione Sant&#x27;Angelo, an area where large numbers of Jews already resided, and ordered it walled off from the rest of the city. A single gate, locked every day at sundown, was the only means of reaching the rest of the city. The Jews themselves were forced to pay all design and construction costs related to the project, which came to a total of roughly 300 &quot;scudi&quot;. The bull restricted Jews in other ways as well. They were forbidden to have more than one synagogue per city—leading, in Rome alone, to the destruction of seven &quot;excess&quot; places of worship. All Jews were forced to wear distinctive yellow hats, especially outside the ghetto, and they were forbidden to trade in everything but food and secondhand clothes. Christians of all ages were encouraged to treat the Jews as second-class citizens; for a Jew to defy a Christian in any way was to invite severe punishment, often at the hands of a mob. By the end of Paul IV&#x27;s five-year reign, the number of Roman Jews had dropped by half. Yet his anti-Jewish legacy endured for over 300 years: the ghetto he established ceased to exist only with the dissolution of the Papal States in 1870. Its walls were torn down in 1888.

According to Leopold von Ranke, a rigid austerity and an earnest zeal for the restoration of primitive habits became the dominant tendency of his papacy. Monks who had left their monasteries were expelled from the city and from the Papal States. He would no longer tolerate the practice by which one man had been allowed to enjoy the revenues of an office while delegating its duties to another.

All begging was forbidden. Even the collection of alms for Masses, which had previously been made by the clergy, was discontinued. A medal was struck representing Christ driving the money changers from the Temple. Paul IV put in place a reform of the papal administration designed to stamp out trafficking of principal positions in the Curia. All secular offices, from the highest to the lowest, were assigned to others based on merit. Important economies were made, and taxes were proportionately remitted. Paul IV established a chest, of which only he held the key, for the purpose of receiving all complaints that anyone desired to make.

During his papacy, censorship reached new heights. Among his first acts as pope was to cut off Michelangelo&#x27;s pension, and he ordered the nudes of &quot;The Last Judgment&quot; in the Sistine Chapel be painted more modestly (a request that Michelangelo ignored) (the beginning of the Vatican&#x27;s Fig leaf campaign). Paul IV also introduced the Index Librorum Prohibitorum or &quot;Index of Prohibited Books&quot; to Venice, then an independent and prosperous trading state, in order to crack down on the growing threat of Protestantism. Under his authority, all books written by Protestants were banned, together with Italian and German translations of the Latin Bible.

In the Papal States, a Marrano presence was noticeable. In Rome and, even more so, the seaport of Ancona, they thrived under benevolent popes Clement VII (1523–34), Paul III (1534–49), and Julius III (1550–55). They even received a guarantee that if accused of apostasy they would be subject only to papal authority. But Paul IV (1555–59), the voice of the Counter-Reformation, dealt them an irreparable blow when he withdrew the protections previously given and initiated a campaign against them. As a result of this, 25 were burned at the stake in the spring of 1556.

===Consistories===

Throughout his pontificate, Paul IV named 46 cardinals in four consistories, including Michele Ghislieri (the future Pope Pius V). According to Robert Maryks, the pope decided to nominate the Jesuit priest Diego Laynez to the cardinalate. However, Father Alfonso Salmerón warned Saint Ignatius of Loyola of this, as did Cardinal Otto Truchsess von Waldburg. In response, Father Pedro de Ribadeneira repeated what the saint had said to him: &quot;If our Lord does not lay down his hand, we will have Master Laínez a cardinal, but I certify to you, if it were, that it be with so much noise that the world would understand how the Society accepts these things&quot;.

==Death==
Paul IV&#x27;s health began to break down in May 1559. He rallied in July, holding public audiences and attending meetings of the Inquisition. But he engaged in fasting, and the heat of the summer wore him down again. He was bedridden, and on 17 August it became clear he would not live. Cardinals and other officials gathered at his bedside on 18 August, where Paul IV asked them to elect a &quot;righteous and holy&quot; successor and to retain the Inquisition as &quot;the very basis&quot; of the Catholic Church&#x27;s power. By 2 or 3 pm, he was close to death, and died at 5 pm.

The people of Rome did not forget what they had suffered because of the war he had brought on the State. Crowds of people gathered at the Piazza del Campidoglio and began rioting even before Paul IV died. His statue, erected before the Campidoglio just months before, had a yellow hat placed on it (similar to the yellow hat Paul IV had forced Jews to wear in public). After a mock trial, the statue was decapitated. It was then thrown into the Tiber.

The crowd broke into the three city jails and freed more than 400 prisoners, then broke into the offices of the Inquisition at the Palazzo dell&#x27; Inquisizone near to the Church of San Rocco. They murdered the Inquisitor, Tommaso Scotti, and freed 72 prisoners. One of those released was Dominican John Craig, who later was a colleague of John Knox. The people ransacked the palace, and then set it afire (destroying the Inquisition&#x27;s records). That same day, or the next day (records are unclear), the crowd attacked the Church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva. The intercession of some local nobility dissuaded them from burning it and killing all those within. On the third day of rioting, the crowd removed the Carafa family coat of arms from all churches, monuments, and other buildings in the city.

The crowd dedicated to him the following pasquinata:

:&quot;Carafa hated by the devil and the sky&quot;
:&quot;is buried here with his rotting corpse,&quot;
:&quot;Erebus has taken the spirit;&quot;
:&quot;he hated peace on earth, our faith he contested.&quot;
:&quot;he ruined the church and the people, men and sky offended;&quot;
:&quot;treacherous friend, suppliant with the army which was fatal to him.&quot;
:&quot;You want to know more? Pope was him and that is enough.&quot;
Such hostile views have not mellowed much with time; modern historians tend to view his papacy as an especially poor one. His policies stemmed from personal prejudices—against Spain, for example, or the Jews—rather than any overarching political or religious goals. In a time of precarious balance between Catholic and Protestant, his adversarial nature did little to slow the latter&#x27;s spread across northern Europe. His anti-Spanish feelings alienated the Habsburgs, arguably the most powerful Catholic rulers in Europe, and his ascetic personal beliefs left him out of touch with the artistic and intellectual movements of his era (he often spoke of whitewashing the Sistine Chapel ceiling). Such a reactionary attitude alienated clergy and laity alike: historian John Julius Norwich calls him &quot;the worst pope of the 16th century.&quot;

Four or five hours after his death, Paul IV&#x27;s body was taken to the Cappella Paolina in the Apostolic Palace. It lay in repose, and a choir sang the Office of the Dead on the morning of 19 August. Cardinals and many others then paid homage to Paul IV (&quot;kissed the feet of the pope&quot;). The canons of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica refused to take his body into the basilica unless they were paid the customary money and gifts. Instead, the canons sang the usual office in the Cappella del Santissimo Sacramento (Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament). Paul IV&#x27;s body was taken to the Sistine Chapel in the Apostolic Palace at 6 pm.

Paul IV&#x27;s nephew, Cardinal-nephew Carlo Carafa, arrived in Rome late on 19 August. Worried that the rioters might break in and desecrate the pope&#x27;s corpse, at 10 pm Cardinal Carafa had Pope Paul IV buried without ceremony next to the Cappella del Volto Santo (Chapel of the Holy Face) in St. Peter&#x27;s. His remains stayed there until October 1566, when his successor as pope, Pius V, had them transferred to Santa Maria sopra Minerva. In the chapel founded by Paul IV&#x27;s uncle and mentor, Cardinal Oliviero Carafa, a tomb was created by Pirro Ligorio and Paul IV&#x27;s remains were placed therein.

==In fiction==
Paul IV&#x27;s title in the Prophecy of St. Malachy is &quot;Of the Faith of Peter&quot;.

As Paul IV, appears as a character in John Webster&#x27;s Jacobean revenge drama &quot;The White Devil&quot; (1612).

In the novel &quot;Q&quot; by Luther Blissett, while not appearing himself, Gian Pietro Carafa is mentioned repeatedly as the cardinal whose spy and &quot;agent provocateur&quot;, Qoelet, causes many of the disasters to befall Protestants during the Reformation and the Roman Church&#x27;s response in the 16th century.

Alison MacLeod&#x27;s 1968 historical novel &quot;The Hireling&quot; depicts Cardinal Carafa befriending the English Cardinal Reginald Pole during Pole&#x27;s long exile in Italy, their later falling out, and Pole&#x27;s feelings of betrayal after Carafa, once elevated to the Papacy, charges him with heresy at the very time when Pole was striving to return England to the Catholic fold.

Pope Paul IV is a major villain in Sholem Asch&#x27;s 1921 historical novel &quot;The Witch of Castile&quot; (Yiddish: &quot;Di Kishufmakherin fun Kastilien&quot;, Hebrew: &quot;Ha&#x27;Machshepha Mi&#x27;Castilia&quot; המכשפה מקשיטליה). The book&#x27;s depiction of a young Sephardi Jewish woman in Rome being falsely accused of witchcraft and being burned at the stake, dying as a Jewish martyr, is placed in the context of Paul IV&#x27;s actual persecution of the Jews.

<text>The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation (MVD; , &quot;Ministerstvo vnutrennikh del&quot;) is the interior ministry of Russia.

The MVD is responsible for law enforcement in Russia through its agencies the Police of Russia, Migration Affairs, Drugs Control, Traffic Safety, the Centre for Combating Extremism, and the Investigative Department. The MVD is headquartered in Zhitnaya Street 16 in Yakimanka, Moscow. Vladimir Kolokoltsev has been the Minister of Internal Affairs since 2012.

==History==
===Russian Empire (1802–1917)===

The first interior ministry (MVD) in Russia was created by Tsar Alexander I on 28 March 1802. The MVD was one of the most powerful governmental bodies of the Empire, responsible for the police forces and Internal Guards, and the supervision of gubernial administrations. Its initial responsibilities also included prisons, firefighting, state enterprises, the state postal system, state property, construction, roads, medicine, clergy, natural resources, and nobility; most of them were transferred to other ministries and government bodies by the mid-19th century.

====Police====
As the central government began to further partition the countryside, the &quot;ispravniks&quot; (chiefs of police) were distributed among the sections. Serving under them in their principal localities were commissaries (). and alike were armed with broad and obscurely-defined powers which, combined with the fact that they were for the most part illiterate and wholly ignorant of the law, formed crushing forces of oppression. Towards the end of the reign of Alexander II, the government, in order to preserve order in the country districts, also created a special class of mounted rural policemen (, from , order), who, in a time without &quot;habeas corpus&quot;, were armed with power to arrest all suspects on the spot. These rapidly became the terror of the countryside. Finally, in the towns of the rural countryside, every house was provided with a &quot;guard dog&quot; of sorts, in the form of a porter (), who was charged with the duty of reporting the presence of any suspicious characters or anything of interest to the police.

====Secret Police====
In addition there was also the secret police, in direct subordination to the ministry of the interior, of which the principal function was the discovery, prevention, and extirpation of political sedition. Its most famous development was the so-called Third Section (of the imperial chancery) instituted by Emperor Nicholas I in 1826. This was entirely independent of the ordinary police, but was associated with the previously existing Special Corps of Gendarmes, whose chief was placed at its head. Its object had originally been to keep the emperor in close touch with all the branches of the administration and to bring to his notice any abuses and irregularities, and for this purpose its chief was in constant personal contact with the sovereign.

Following the growth of the revolutionary movement and the assassination of Emperior Alexander II, the Department of State Police inherited the secret police functions of the dismissed Third Section and transferred the most capable Gendarmes to the Okhrana. In 1896 the powers of the minister were extended at the expense of those of the under-secretary, who remained only at the head of the corps of gendarmes; but by a law of 24 September 1904 this was reversed, and the under-secretary was again placed at the head of all the police with the title of under-secretary for the administration of the police.

By World War I, the department had spawned a counter-intelligence section. After the February Revolution of 1917, the Gendarmes and the Okhrana were disbanded as anti-revolutionary.

===Soviet era (1917–89)===

Having won the October Revolution, the Bolsheviks disbanded the &quot;tsarist&quot; police forces and formed an all-proletarian &quot;Workers&#x27; and Peasants&#x27; Militsiya&quot; under the NKVD of the Russian SFSR. After the establishment of the USSR, there was no Soviet (federal) NKVD until 1934. In March 1946, all of the People&#x27;s Commissariats (NK) were redesignated as Ministries (M). The NKVD was renamed the MVD of the USSR, along with its former subordinate, the NKGB which became the MGB of the USSR. The NKVDs of Union Republics also became Ministries of Internal Affairs subordinate to MVD of the USSR.

Secret police became a part of MVD after Lavrenty Beria merged the MGB into the MVD in March 1953. Within a year Beria&#x27;s downfall caused the MVD to be split up again; after that, the MVD retained its &quot;internal security&quot; (police) functions, while the new KGB took on &quot;state security&quot; (secret police) functions.

In his efforts to fight bureaucracy and maintain &#x27;Leninist principles&#x27;, Nikita Khrushchev, as the Premier of the Soviet Union, called for the dismissal of the All-Union MVD. The Ministry ceased to exist in January 1960, and its functions were transferred to the respective Republican Ministries. The MVD of the Russian SFSR was renamed the Ministry for Securing the Public Order in 1962. Leonid Brezhnev again recreated the All-Union Ministry for Securing the Public Order in July 1966, and later assigned Nikolai Shchelokov as Minister; the RSFSR Ministry was disbanded for the second time, the first being at the creation of the NKVD of the Soviet Union. The MVD regained its original title in 1968. Another role of the reformed MVD was to combat &quot;economic crimes&quot;, that is, to suppress private business which was largely prohibited by socialist law. This fight was never successful, due to the pervasive nature of the black market.

By the mid-1980s, the image of the &quot;people&#x27;s militsiya&quot; was largely compromised by the corruption and disorderly behaviour of both enlisted and officer staff (the most shocking case was the robbery and by a group of militsiya officers stationed in the Moscow Metro in 1980).

===Russian Federation (1990–present)===
====Organizational changes====
The Russian MVD re-formed as the MVD of the Russian SFSR in 1990, following the restoration of the republican Russian Council of Ministers and the Supreme Soviet of Russia. It continued in its functions when Russia gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. the Ministry controlled: the Politsiya (formerly Militsiya), the General Administration for Traffic Safety, and the Federal Drug Control Service.

Since the disbanding of the Russian Tax Police Service in 2003, the MVD also investigates economic crimes. Two long-time units of the Imperial MVD and NKVD, the Russian Firefighting Service and the Federal Prisons Service, transferred to the Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations in 2001 and to the Russian Ministry of Justice in 2006, respectively. The last reorganization abolished Main Directorates inherited from the NKVD in favour of Departments. In 2012, career police officer Vladimir Kolokoltsev became the Minister of Internal Affairs in Russia.

On 5 April 2016, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the Russian Internal Troops, OMON (the Special Purpose Mobility Unit), and SOBR (SWAT) forces to form the basis of the newly created National Guard of Russia, and these close to 200,000 public order, special police, and internal troop forces previously under the command of the MVD were reassigned to the Security Council of Russia. In turn and on the same day, the Federal Drug Control Service and the Federal Migration Service merged into the MVD, and are now known as the Main Directorate for Drugs Control and the Main Directorate for Migration Affairs, respectively.

====2005–19====

In 2006, investigative journalist Anna Politkovskaya was murdered. Six years later, the former head of surveillance at Moscow’s main Internal Affairs Directorate was found guilty of organizing her murder by tracking her movements and giving a gun to the killer.

In December 2019, Distributed Denial of Secrets listed a leak from Russia&#x27;s Ministry of the Interior, portions of which detailed the deployment of Russian troops to Ukraine, at a time when the Kremlin was denying a military presence there. Some material from that leak was published in 2014, about half of it was not, and WikiLeaks reportedly rejected a request to host the files two years later, at a time when Julian Assange was focused on exposing Democratic Party documents passed to WikiLeaks by Kremlin hackers.

====2020–present====

The founder and editor of the independent news site Koza.Press, known professionally as Irina Slavina, was harassed by law enforcement for years. On October 2, 2020, she committed suicide by self-immolation outside a regional Ministry of Internal Affairs building, writing on Facebook, “For my death, please blame the Russian Federation.”

In September 2023, Russia&#x27;s Ministry of Internal Affairs decided to have an appeal by imprisoned opposition leader Alexey Navalny challenging his 19-year prison sentence on extremism charges held by a court behind closed doors, and the appeal was dismissed. Supporters of Navalny said he was being silenced for criticizing President Vladimir Putin&#x27;s government. In 2020 Navalny was poisoned in Russia with the Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok.

Telecommunications service providers are required to grant the Ministry of Internal Affairs 24-hour remote access to their client databases, including telephone and electronic communication and records, enabling the Ministry to track private communications and internet activity without the users&#x27; knowledge. The law permits authorities to monitor telephone calls in real time.

The Pareto distribution, named after the Italian civil engineer, economist, and sociologist Vilfredo Pareto, is a power-law probability distribution that is used in description of social, quality control, scientific, geophysical, actuarial, and many other types of observable phenomena; the principle originally applied to describing the distribution of wealth in a society, fitting the trend that a large portion of wealth is held by a small fraction of the population.

The &quot;Pareto principle&quot; or &quot;80:20 rule&quot; stating that 80% of outcomes are due to 20% of causes was named in honour of Pareto, but the concepts are distinct, and only Pareto distributions with shape value () precisely reflect it. Empirical observation has shown that this 80:20 distribution fits a wide range of cases, including natural phenomena and human activities.

==Definitions==
If &quot;X&quot; is a random variable with a Pareto (Type I) distribution, then the probability that &quot;X&quot; is greater than some number &quot;x&quot;, i.e., the survival function (also called tail function), is given by

:formula_14

where &quot;x&quot;m is the (necessarily positive) minimum possible value of &quot;X&quot;, and &quot;α&quot; is a positive parameter. The type I Pareto distribution is characterized by a scale parameter &quot;x&quot;m and a shape parameter &quot;α&quot;, which is known as the &quot;tail index&quot;. If this distribution is used to model the distribution of wealth, then the parameter &quot;α&quot; is called the Pareto index.

===Cumulative distribution function===
From the definition, the cumulative distribution function of a Pareto random variable with parameters &quot;α&quot; and &quot;x&quot;m is

:formula_15

===Probability density function===
It follows (by differentiation) that the probability density function is

:formula_16

When plotted on linear axes, the distribution assumes the familiar J-shaped curve which approaches each of the orthogonal axes asymptotically. All segments of the curve are self-similar (subject to appropriate scaling factors). When plotted in a log–log plot, the distribution is represented by a straight line.

==Properties==
===Moments and characteristic function===
* The expected value of a random variable following a Pareto distribution is
:: formula_17
* The variance of a random variable following a Pareto distribution is

:: formula_18

: (If &quot;α&quot; ≤ 2, the variance does not exist.)
* The raw moments are

:: formula_19
* The moment generating function is only defined for non-positive values &quot;t&quot; ≤ 0 as

::formula_20
::formula_21
Thus, since the expectation does not converge on an open interval containing formula_22 we say that the moment generating function does not exist.
* The characteristic function is given by

:: formula_23

: where Γ(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;x&quot;) is the incomplete gamma function.

The parameters may be solved for using the method of moments.

===Conditional distributions===
The conditional probability distribution of a Pareto-distributed random variable, given the event that it is greater than or equal to a particular number formula_24 exceeding formula_25, is a Pareto distribution with the same Pareto index formula_26 but with minimum formula_24 instead of formula_25:

:formula_29

This implies that the conditional expected value (if it is finite, i.e. formula_30) is proportional to formula_24:

:formula_32

In case of random variables that describe the lifetime of an object, this means that life expectancy is proportional to age, and is called the Lindy effect or Lindy&#x27;s Law.

===A characterization theorem===
Suppose formula_33 are independent identically distributed random variables whose probability distribution is supported on the interval formula_34 for some formula_35. Suppose that for all formula_36, the two random variables formula_37 and formula_38 are independent. Then the common distribution is a Pareto distribution.

===Geometric mean===
The geometric mean (&quot;G&quot;) is

: formula_39

===Harmonic mean===
The harmonic mean (&quot;H&quot;) is

: formula_40

===Graphical representation===
The characteristic curved &#x27;long tail&#x27; distribution, when plotted on a linear scale, masks the underlying simplicity of the function when plotted on a log-log graph, which then takes the form of a straight line with negative gradient: It follows from the formula for the probability density function that for &quot;x&quot; ≥ &quot;x&quot;m,

:formula_41

Since &quot;α&quot; is positive, the gradient −(&quot;α&quot; + 1) is negative.

==Related distributions==
===Generalized Pareto distributions===
There is a hierarchy of Pareto distributions known as Pareto Type I, II, III, IV, and Feller–Pareto distributions. Pareto Type IV contains Pareto Type I–III as special cases. The Feller–Pareto distribution generalizes Pareto Type IV.
====Pareto types I–IV====
The Pareto distribution hierarchy is summarized in the next table comparing the survival functions (complementary CDF).

When &quot;μ&quot; = 0, the Pareto distribution Type II is also known as the Lomax distribution.

In this section, the symbol &quot;x&quot;m, used before to indicate the minimum value of &quot;x&quot;, is replaced by &quot;σ&quot;.

The shape parameter &quot;α&quot; is the tail index, &quot;μ&quot; is location, &quot;σ&quot; is scale, &quot;γ&quot; is an inequality parameter. Some special cases of Pareto Type (IV) are

::formula_42
::formula_43
::formula_44

The finiteness of the mean, and the existence and the finiteness of the variance depend on the tail index &quot;α&quot; (inequality index &quot;γ&quot;). In particular, fractional &quot;δ&quot;-moments are finite for some &quot;δ&quot; &gt; 0, as shown in the table below, where &quot;δ&quot; is not necessarily an integer.

====Feller–Pareto distribution====
Feller defines a Pareto variable by transformation &quot;U&quot; = &quot;Y&quot;−1 − 1 of a beta random variable ,&quot;Y&quot;, whose probability density function is

:formula_45

where &quot;B&quot;( ) is the beta function. If

:formula_46

then &quot;W&quot; has a Feller–Pareto distribution FP(&quot;μ&quot;, &quot;σ&quot;, &quot;γ&quot;, &quot;γ&quot;1, &quot;γ&quot;2).

If formula_47 and formula_48 are independent Gamma variables, another construction of a Feller–Pareto (FP) variable is

:formula_49

and we write &quot;W&quot; ~ FP(&quot;μ&quot;, &quot;σ&quot;, &quot;γ&quot;, &quot;δ&quot;1, &quot;δ&quot;2). Special cases of the Feller–Pareto distribution are

:formula_50
:formula_51
:formula_52
:formula_53

===Inverse-Pareto Distribution / Power Distribution ===

When a random variable formula_54 follows a pareto distribution, then its inverse formula_55 follows a Power distribution. 
Inverse Pareto distribution is equivalent to a Power distribution 

:formula_56

===Relation to the exponential distribution===
The Pareto distribution is related to the exponential distribution as follows. If &quot;X&quot; is Pareto-distributed with minimum &quot;x&quot;m and index &quot;α&quot;, then

: formula_57

is exponentially distributed with rate parameter &quot;α&quot;. Equivalently, if &quot;Y&quot; is exponentially distributed with rate &quot;α&quot;, then

: formula_58

is Pareto-distributed with minimum &quot;x&quot;m and index &quot;α&quot;.

This can be shown using the standard change-of-variable techniques:

: formula_59

The last expression is the cumulative distribution function of an exponential distribution with rate &quot;α&quot;.

Pareto distribution can be constructed by hierarchical exponential distributions. Let
formula_60 and
formula_61. Then we have formula_62 and, as a result, formula_63.

More in general, if formula_64 (shape-rate parametrization) and formula_65, then formula_66.

Equivalently, if formula_67 and formula_68, then formula_69.

===Relation to the log-normal distribution===
The Pareto distribution and log-normal distribution are alternative distributions for describing the same types of quantities. One of the connections between the two is that they are both the distributions of the exponential of random variables distributed according to other common distributions, respectively the exponential distribution and normal distribution. (See the previous section.)

===Relation to the generalized Pareto distribution===
The Pareto distribution is a special case of the generalized Pareto distribution, which is a family of distributions of similar form, but containing an extra parameter in such a way that the support of the distribution is either bounded below (at a variable point), or bounded both above and below (where both are variable), with the Lomax distribution as a special case. This family also contains both the unshifted and shifted exponential distributions.

The Pareto distribution with scale formula_70 and shape formula_26 is equivalent to the generalized Pareto distribution with location formula_72, scale formula_73 and shape formula_74 and, conversely, one can get the Pareto distribution from the GPD by taking formula_75 and formula_76 if formula_77.

===Bounded Pareto distribution===

The bounded (or truncated) Pareto distribution has three parameters: &quot;α&quot;, &quot;L&quot; and &quot;H&quot;. As in the standard Pareto distribution &quot;α&quot; determines the shape. &quot;L&quot; denotes the minimal value, and &quot;H&quot; denotes the maximal value.

The probability density function is

: formula_84,

where &quot;L&quot; ≤ &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;H&quot;, and &quot;α&quot; &gt; 0.

====Generating bounded Pareto random variables====
If &quot;U&quot; is uniformly distributed on (0, 1), then applying inverse-transform method 

:formula_85
:formula_86

is a bounded Pareto-distributed.
===Symmetric Pareto distribution===
The purpose of the Symmetric and Zero Symmetric Pareto distributions is to capture some special statistical distribution with a sharp probability peak and symmetric long probability tails. These two distributions are derived from the Pareto distribution. Long probability tails normally means that probability decays slowly, and can be used to fit a variety of datasets. But if the distribution has symmetric structure with two slow decaying tails, Pareto could not do it. Then Symmetric Pareto or Zero Symmetric Pareto distribution is applied instead.

The Cumulative distribution function (CDF) of Symmetric Pareto distribution is defined as following:

formula_87

This distribution has two parameters: a and b. It is symmetric about b. Then the mathematic expectation is b. When, it has variance as following:

formula_88

The CDF of Zero Symmetric Pareto (ZSP) distribution is defined as following:

formula_89

The corresponding PDF is:

formula_90

This distribution is symmetric about zero. Parameter a is related to the decay rate of probability and (a/2b) represents peak magnitude of probability.

===Multivariate Pareto distribution===
The univariate Pareto distribution has been extended to a multivariate Pareto distribution.

==Statistical inference==

===Estimation of parameters===
The likelihood function for the Pareto distribution parameters &quot;α&quot; and &quot;x&quot;m, given an independent sample &quot;x&quot; = (&quot;x&quot;1, &quot;x&quot;2, ..., &quot;xn&quot;), is

: formula_91

Therefore, the logarithmic likelihood function is

: formula_92

It can be seen that formula_93 is monotonically increasing with &quot;x&quot;m, that is, the greater the value of &quot;x&quot;m, the greater the value of the likelihood function. Hence, since &quot;x&quot; ≥ &quot;x&quot;m, we conclude that

: formula_94

To find the estimator for &quot;α&quot;, we compute the corresponding partial derivative and determine where it is zero:

: formula_95

Thus the maximum likelihood estimator for &quot;α&quot; is:

: formula_96

The expected statistical error is:

: formula_97

Malik (1970) gives the exact joint distribution of formula_98. In particular, formula_99 and formula_100 are independent and formula_99 is Pareto with scale parameter &quot;x&quot;m and shape parameter &quot;nα&quot;, whereas formula_100 has an inverse-gamma distribution with shape and scale parameters &quot;n&quot; − 1 and &quot;nα&quot;, respectively.

==Occurrence and applications==
===General===
Vilfredo Pareto originally used this distribution to describe the allocation of wealth among individuals since it seemed to show rather well the way that a larger portion of the wealth of any society is owned by a smaller percentage of the people in that society. He also used it to describe distribution of income. This idea is sometimes expressed more simply as the Pareto principle or the &quot;80-20 rule&quot; which says that 20% of the population controls 80% of the wealth. As Michael Hudson points out (&quot;The Collapse of Antiquity&quot; [2023] p. 85 &amp; n.7) &quot;a mathematical corollary [is] that 10% would have 65% of the wealth, and 5% would have half the national wealth.” However, the 80-20 rule corresponds to a particular value of &quot;α&quot;, and in fact, Pareto&#x27;s data on British income taxes in his &quot;Cours d&#x27;économie politique&quot; indicates that about 30% of the population had about 70% of the income. The probability density function (PDF) graph at the beginning of this article shows that the &quot;probability&quot; or fraction of the population that owns a small amount of wealth per person is rather high, and then decreases steadily as wealth increases. (The Pareto distribution is not realistic for wealth for the lower end, however. In fact, net worth may even be negative.) This distribution is not limited to describing wealth or income, but to many situations in which an equilibrium is found in the distribution of the &quot;small&quot; to the &quot;large&quot;. The following examples are sometimes seen as approximately Pareto-distributed:

* All four variables of the household&#x27;s budget constraint: consumption, labor income, capital income, and wealth.
* The sizes of human settlements (few cities, many hamlets/villages)
* File size distribution of Internet traffic which uses the TCP protocol (many smaller files, few larger ones)
* Hard disk drive error rates
* Clusters of Bose–Einstein condensate near absolute zero

* The values of oil reserves in oil fields (a few large fields, many small fields)
* The length distribution in jobs assigned to supercomputers (a few large ones, many small ones)
* The standardized price returns on individual stocks 
* Sizes of sand particles 
* The size of meteorites
* Severity of large casualty losses for certain lines of business such as general liability, commercial auto, and workers compensation.
* Amount of time a user on Steam will spend playing different games. (Some games get played a lot, but most get played almost never.) 
* In hydrology the Pareto distribution is applied to extreme events such as annually maximum one-day rainfalls and river discharges. The blue picture illustrates an example of fitting the Pareto distribution to ranked annually maximum one-day rainfalls showing also the 90% confidence belt based on the binomial distribution. The rainfall data are represented by plotting positions as part of the cumulative frequency analysis.
* In Electric Utility Distribution Reliability (80% of the Customer Minutes Interrupted occur on approximately 20% of the days in a given year).

===Relation to Zipf&#x27;s law===
The Pareto distribution is a continuous probability distribution. Zipf&#x27;s law, also sometimes called the zeta distribution, is a discrete distribution, separating the values into a simple ranking. Both are a simple power law with a negative exponent, scaled so that their cumulative distributions equal 1. Zipf&#x27;s can be derived from the Pareto distribution if the formula_103 values (incomes) are binned into formula_104 ranks so that the number of people in each bin follows a 1/rank pattern. The distribution is normalized by defining formula_70 so that formula_106 where formula_107 is the generalized harmonic number. This makes Zipf&#x27;s probability density function derivable from Pareto&#x27;s.

: formula_108

where formula_109 and formula_103 is an integer representing rank from 1 to N where N is the highest income bracket. So a randomly selected person (or word, website link, or city) from a population (or language, internet, or country) has formula_111 probability of ranking formula_103.

===Relation to the &quot;Pareto principle&quot;===
The &quot;80–20 law&quot;, according to which 20% of all people receive 80% of all income, and 20% of the most affluent 20% receive 80% of that 80%, and so on, holds precisely when the Pareto index is formula_113. This result can be derived from the Lorenz curve formula given below. Moreover, the following have been shown to be mathematically equivalent:
* Income is distributed according to a Pareto distribution with index &quot;α&quot; &gt; 1.
* There is some number 0 ≤ &quot;p&quot; ≤ 1/2 such that 100&quot;p&quot; % of all people receive 100(1 − &quot;p&quot;)% of all income, and similarly for every real (not necessarily integer) &quot;n&quot; &gt; 0, 100&quot;pn&quot; % of all people receive 100(1 − &quot;p&quot;)&quot;n&quot; percentage of all income. &quot;α&quot; and &quot;p&quot; are related by
:: formula_114

This does not apply only to income, but also to wealth, or to anything else that can be modeled by this distribution.

This excludes Pareto distributions in which 0 &lt; &quot;α&quot; ≤ 1, which, as noted above, have an infinite expected value, and so cannot reasonably model income distribution.

===Relation to Price&#x27;s law===
Price&#x27;s square root law is sometimes offered as a property of or as similar to the Pareto distribution. However, the law only holds in the case that formula_115. Note that in this case, the total and expected amount of wealth are not defined, and the rule only applies asymptotically to random samples. The extended Pareto Principle mentioned above is a far more general rule.

===Lorenz curve and Gini coefficient===
The Lorenz curve is often used to characterize income and wealth distributions. For any distribution, the Lorenz curve &quot;L&quot;(&quot;F&quot;) is written in terms of the PDF &quot;f&quot; or the CDF &quot;F&quot; as

:formula_116

where &quot;x&quot;(&quot;F&quot;) is the inverse of the CDF. For the Pareto distribution,

:formula_117

and the Lorenz curve is calculated to be

:formula_118

For formula_119 the denominator is infinite, yielding &quot;L&quot;=0. Examples of the Lorenz curve for a number of Pareto distributions are shown in the graph on the right.

According to Oxfam (2016) the richest 62 people have as much wealth as the poorest half of the world&#x27;s population. We can estimate the Pareto index that would apply to this situation. Letting ε equal formula_120 we have:
:formula_121
or
:formula_122
The solution is that &quot;α&quot; equals about 1.15, and about 9% of the wealth is owned by each of the two groups. But actually the poorest 69% of the world adult population owns only about 3% of the wealth.

The Gini coefficient is a measure of the deviation of the Lorenz curve from the equidistribution line which is a line connecting [0, 0] and [1, 1], which is shown in black (&quot;α&quot; = ∞) in the Lorenz plot on the right. Specifically, the Gini coefficient is twice the area between the Lorenz curve and the equidistribution line. The Gini coefficient for the Pareto distribution is then calculated (for formula_123) to be

:formula_124

(see Aaberge 2005).

==Random variate generation==
Random samples can be generated using inverse transform sampling. Given a random variate &quot;U&quot; drawn from the uniform distribution on the unit interval [0, 1], the variate &quot;T&quot; given by

:formula_125

is Pareto-distributed.

<doc id="53058" wikidata="Q1193403" url="?curid=53058" title="Regular space">
<text>In topology and related fields of mathematics, a topological space &quot;X&quot; is called a regular space if every closed subset &quot;C&quot; of &quot;X&quot; and a point &quot;p&quot; not contained in &quot;C&quot; have non-overlapping open neighborhoods. Thus &quot;p&quot; and &quot;C&quot; can be separated by neighborhoods. This condition is known as Axiom T3. The term &quot;T3 space&quot; usually means &quot;a regular Hausdorff space&quot;. These conditions are examples of separation axioms.

==Definitions==
A topological space &quot;X&quot; is a regular space if, given any closed set &quot;F&quot; and any point &quot;x&quot; that does not belong to &quot;F&quot;, there exists a neighbourhood &quot;U&quot; of &quot;x&quot; and a neighbourhood &quot;V&quot; of &quot;F&quot; that are disjoint. Concisely put, it must be possible to separate &quot;x&quot; and &quot;F&quot; with disjoint neighborhoods.

A &#x27; or &#x27; is a topological space that is both regular and a Hausdorff space. (A Hausdorff space or T2 space is a topological space in which any two distinct points are separated by neighbourhoods.) It turns out that a space is T3 if and only if it is both regular and T0. (A T0 or Kolmogorov space is a topological space in which any two distinct points are topologically distinguishable, i.e., for every pair of distinct points, at least one of them has an open neighborhood not containing the other.) Indeed, if a space is Hausdorff then it is T0, and each T0 regular space is Hausdorff: given two distinct points, at least one of them misses the closure of the other one, so (by regularity) there exist disjoint neighborhoods separating one point from (the closure of) the other.

Although the definitions presented here for &quot;regular&quot; and &quot;T3&quot; are not uncommon, there is significant variation in the literature: some authors switch the definitions of &quot;regular&quot; and &quot;T3&quot; as they are used here, or use both terms interchangeably. This article uses the term &quot;regular&quot; freely, but will usually say &quot;regular Hausdorff&quot;, which is unambiguous, instead of the less precise &quot;T3&quot;. For more on this issue, see History of the separation axioms.

A is a topological space where every point has an open neighbourhood that is regular. Every regular space is locally regular, but the converse is not true. A classical example of a locally regular space that is not regular is the bug-eyed line.

== Relationships to other separation axioms ==
A regular space is necessarily also preregular, i.e., any two topologically distinguishable points can be separated by neighbourhoods.
Since a Hausdorff space is the same as a preregular T0 space, a regular space which is also T0 must be Hausdorff (and thus T3).
In fact, a regular Hausdorff space satisfies the slightly stronger condition T2½.
(However, such a space need not be completely Hausdorff.)
Thus, the definition of T3 may cite T0, T1, or T2½ instead of T2 (Hausdorffness); all are equivalent in the context of regular spaces.

Speaking more theoretically, the conditions of regularity and T3-ness are related by Kolmogorov quotients.
A space is regular if and only if its Kolmogorov quotient is T3; and, as mentioned, a space is T3 if and only if it&#x27;s both regular and T0.
Thus a regular space encountered in practice can usually be assumed to be T3, by replacing the space with its Kolmogorov quotient.

There are many results for topological spaces that hold for both regular and Hausdorff spaces.
Most of the time, these results hold for all preregular spaces; they were listed for regular and Hausdorff spaces separately because the idea of preregular spaces came later.
On the other hand, those results that are truly about regularity generally don&#x27;t also apply to nonregular Hausdorff spaces.

There are many situations where another condition of topological spaces (such as normality, pseudonormality, paracompactness, or local compactness) will imply regularity if some weaker separation axiom, such as preregularity, is satisfied.
Such conditions often come in two versions: a regular version and a Hausdorff version.
Although Hausdorff spaces aren&#x27;t generally regular, a Hausdorff space that is also (say) locally compact will be regular, because any Hausdorff space is preregular.
Thus from a certain point of view, regularity is not really the issue here, and we could impose a weaker condition instead to get the same result.
However, definitions are usually still phrased in terms of regularity, since this condition is more well known than any weaker one.

Most topological spaces studied in mathematical analysis are regular; in fact, they are usually completely regular, which is a stronger condition.
Regular spaces should also be contrasted with normal spaces.

== Examples and nonexamples ==
A zero-dimensional space with respect to the small inductive dimension has a base consisting of clopen sets.
Every such space is regular.

As described above, any completely regular space is regular, and any T0 space that is not Hausdorff (and hence not preregular) cannot be regular.
Most examples of regular and nonregular spaces studied in mathematics may be found in those two articles.
On the other hand, spaces that are regular but not completely regular, or preregular but not regular, are usually constructed only to provide counterexamples to conjectures, showing the boundaries of possible theorems.
Of course, one can easily find regular spaces that are not T0, and thus not Hausdorff, such as an indiscrete space, but these examples provide more insight on the T0 axiom than on regularity. An example of a regular space that is not completely regular is the Tychonoff corkscrew.

Most interesting spaces in mathematics that are regular also satisfy some stronger condition.
Thus, regular spaces are usually studied to find properties and theorems, such as the ones below, that are actually applied to completely regular spaces, typically in analysis.

There exist Hausdorff spaces that are not regular. An example is the K-topology on the set formula_1 of real numbers. More generally, if formula_2 is a fixed nonclosed subset of formula_1 with empty interior with respect to the usual Euclidean topology, one can construct a finer topology on formula_1 by taking as a base the collection of all sets formula_5 and formula_6 for formula_5 open in the usual topology. That topology will be Hausdorff, but not regular.

== Elementary properties ==
Suppose that &quot;X&quot; is a regular space.
Then, given any point &quot;x&quot; and neighbourhood &quot;G&quot; of &quot;x&quot;, there is a closed neighbourhood &quot;E&quot; of &quot;x&quot; that is a subset of &quot;G&quot;.
In fancier terms, the closed neighbourhoods of &quot;x&quot; form a local base at &quot;x&quot;.
In fact, this property characterises regular spaces; if the closed neighbourhoods of each point in a topological space form a local base at that point, then the space must be regular.

Taking the interiors of these closed neighbourhoods, we see that the regular open sets form a base for the open sets of the regular space &quot;X&quot;.
This property is actually weaker than regularity; a topological space whose regular open sets form a base is &quot;semiregular&quot;.

<text>Kerckhoffs&#x27;s principle (also called Kerckhoffs&#x27;s desideratum, assumption, axiom, doctrine or law) of cryptography was stated by Dutch-born cryptographer Auguste Kerckhoffs in the 19th century. The principle holds that a cryptosystem should be secure, even if everything about the system, except the key, is public knowledge. This concept is widely embraced by cryptographers, in contrast to security through obscurity, which is not.

Kerckhoffs&#x27;s principle was phrased by American mathematician Claude Shannon as &quot;the enemy knows the system&quot;, i.e., &quot;one ought to design systems under the assumption that the enemy will immediately gain full familiarity with them&quot;. In that form, it is called Shannon&#x27;s maxim.

Another formulation by American researcher and professor Steven M. Bellovin is:
In other words — design your system assuming that your opponents know it in detail. (A former official at NSA&#x27;s National Computer Security Center told me that the standard assumption there was that serial number 1 of any new device was delivered to the Kremlin.)

==Origins==
The invention of telegraphy radically changed military communications and increased the number of messages that needed to be protected from the enemy dramatically, leading to the development of field ciphers which had to be easy to use without large confidential codebooks prone to capture on the battlefield. It was this environment which led to the development of Kerckhoffs&#x27; requirements.

Auguste Kerckhoffs was a professor of German language at Ecole des Hautes Etudes Commerciales (HEC) in Paris. In early 1883, Kerckhoffs&#x27; article, &quot;La Cryptographie Militaire&quot;, was published in two parts in the &quot;Journal of Military Science&quot;, in which he stated six design rules for military ciphers. Translated from French, they are:

# The system must be practically, if not mathematically, indecipherable;
# It should not require secrecy, and it should not be a problem if it falls into enemy hands;
# It must be possible to communicate and remember the key without using written notes, and correspondents must be able to change or modify it at will;
# It must be applicable to telegraph communications;
# It must be portable, and should not require several persons to handle or operate;
# Lastly, given the circumstances in which it is to be used, the system must be easy to use and should not be stressful to use or require its users to know and comply with a long list of rules.

Some are no longer relevant given the ability of computers to perform complex encryption. The second rule, now known as Kerckhoffs&#x27;s principle, is still critically important.

==Explanation of the principle==
Kerckhoffs viewed cryptography as a rival to, and a better alternative than, steganographic encoding, which was common in the nineteenth century for hiding the meaning of military messages. One problem with encoding schemes is that they rely on humanly-held secrets such as &quot;dictionaries&quot; which disclose for example, the secret meaning of words. Steganographic-like dictionaries, once revealed, permanently compromise a corresponding encoding system. Another problem is that the risk of exposure increases as the number of users holding the secrets increases.

Nineteenth century cryptography, in contrast, used simple tables which provided for the transposition of alphanumeric characters, generally given row-column intersections which could be modified by keys which were generally short, numeric, and could be committed to human memory. The system was considered &quot;indecipherable&quot; because tables and keys do not convey meaning by themselves. Secret messages can be compromised only if a matching set of table, key, and message falls into enemy hands in a relevant time frame. Kerckhoffs viewed tactical messages as only having a few hours of relevance. Systems are not necessarily compromised, because their components (i.e. alphanumeric character tables and keys) can be easily changed.

=== Advantage of secret keys ===
Using secure cryptography is supposed to replace the difficult problem of keeping messages secure with a much more manageable one, keeping relatively small keys secure. A system that requires long-term secrecy for something as large and complex as the whole design of a cryptographic system obviously cannot achieve that goal. It only replaces one hard problem with another. However, if a system is secure even when the enemy knows everything except the key, then all that is needed is to manage keeping the keys secret.

There are a large number of ways the internal details of a widely used system could be discovered. The most obvious is that someone could bribe, blackmail, or otherwise threaten staff or customers into explaining the system. In war, for example, one side will probably capture some equipment and people from the other side. Each side will also use spies to gather information.

If a method involves software, someone could do memory dumps or run the software under the control of a debugger in order to understand the method. If hardware is being used, someone could buy or steal some of the hardware and build whatever programs or gadgets needed to test it. Hardware can also be dismantled so that the chip details can be examined under the microscope.

=== Maintaining security ===
A generalization some make from Kerckhoffs&#x27;s principle is: &quot;The fewer and simpler the secrets that one must keep to ensure system security, the easier it is to maintain system security.&quot; Bruce Schneier ties it in with a belief that all security systems must be designed to fail as gracefully as possible:
Any security system depends crucially on keeping some things secret. However, Kerckhoffs&#x27;s principle points out that the things kept secret ought to be those least costly to change if inadvertently disclosed.

For example, a cryptographic algorithm may be implemented by hardware and software that is widely distributed among users. If security depends on keeping that secret, then disclosure leads to major logistic difficulties in developing, testing, and distributing implementations of a new algorithm – it is &quot;brittle&quot;. On the other hand, if keeping the algorithm secret is not important, but only the &quot;keys&quot; used with the algorithm must be secret, then disclosure of the keys simply requires the simpler, less costly process of generating and distributing new keys.

==Applications==
In accordance with Kerckhoffs&#x27;s principle, the majority of civilian cryptography makes use of publicly known algorithms. By contrast, ciphers used to protect classified government or military information are often kept secret (see Type 1 encryption). However, it should not be assumed that government/military ciphers must be kept secret to maintain security. It is possible that they are intended to be as cryptographically sound as public algorithms, and the decision to keep them secret is in keeping with a layered security posture.

==Security through obscurity==

It is moderately common for companies, and sometimes even standards bodies as in the case of the CSS encryption on DVDs, to keep the inner workings of a system secret. Some argue this &quot;security by obscurity&quot; makes the product safer and less vulnerable to attack. A counter-argument is that keeping the innards secret may improve security in the short term, but in the long run, only systems that have been published and analyzed should be trusted.

<text>The Magician&#x27;s Nephew is a portal fantasy novel by British author C. S. Lewis, published in 1955 by The Bodley Head. It is the sixth published of seven novels in &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot; (1950–1956). In recent editions, which sequence the books according in chronological order, it is placed as the first volume of the series. Like the others, it was illustrated by Pauline Baynes whose work has been retained in many later editions. The Bodley Head was a new publisher for &quot;The Chronicles&quot;, a change from Geoffrey Bles who had published the previous five novels.

&quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot; is a prequel to the series. The middle third of the novel features the creation of the Narnia world by Aslan the lion, centred on a section of a lamp-post brought by accidental observers from London in 1900. The visitors then participate in the beginning of Narnia&#x27;s history, 1000 years before &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; (which inaugurated the series in 1950).

The frame story, set in England, features two children ensnared in experimental travel via &quot;the wood between the worlds&quot;. Thus, the novel shows Narnia and our middle-aged world to be only two of many in a multiverse, which changes as some worlds begin and others end. It also explains the origin of foreign elements in Narnia, not only the lamp-post but also the White Witch and a human king and queen.

Lewis began &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot; soon after completing &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;, spurred by a friend&#x27;s question about the lamp-post in the middle of nowhere, but he needed more than five years to complete it. The story includes several autobiographical elements and explores a number of themes with general moral and Christian implications, including atonement, original sin, temptation, and the order of nature.

==Plot summary==
The story begins in London during the summer of 1900. Two children, Digory and Polly, meet while playing in the adjacent gardens of a row of terraced houses. They decide to explore the abandoned attic beyond Digory&#x27;s house, but do not walk far enough, and find themselves in Uncle Andrew&#x27;s study. Uncle Andrew tricks Polly into touching a yellow magic ring, causing her to vanish. Then he explains to Digory that he has been dabbling in magic, and that the rings allow travel between one world and another. He blackmails Digory into taking another yellow ring to follow wherever Polly has gone, and two green rings so that they both can return.

Digory finds himself transported to a sleepy woodland with an almost narcotic effect; he finds Polly nearby. The woodland is filled with pools. Digory and Polly surmise that the wood is not really a proper world at all but a &quot;Wood between the Worlds&quot;, similar to the attic that links their houses back in England, and that each pool leads to a separate universe. They decide to explore a different world before returning to England, and jump into one of the nearby pools. They then find themselves in a desolate abandoned city of the ancient world of Charn. Inside the ruined palace, they discover statues of Charn&#x27;s former kings and queens, which degenerate from the fair and wise to the unhappy and cruel. They find a bell with a hammer and an inscription inviting the finder to strike the bell.

Despite protests from Polly, Digory rings the bell. This awakens the last of the statues, a witch queen named Jadis, whoto avoid defeat in battlehad deliberately killed every living thing in Charn by speaking the &quot;Deplorable Word&quot;. As the only survivor left in her world, she placed herself in an enchanted sleep that would only be broken by someone ringing the bell.

The children recognise Jadis as evil and attempt to flee, but she follows them back to England by clinging to them as they clutch their rings. In England, she discovers that her magical powers do not work, although she retains her superhuman strength. Dismissing Uncle Andrew as a poor magician, she enslaves him and orders him to fetch her a &quot;chariot&quot;a hansom cabso she can set about conquering Earth. They leave, and she attracts attention by robbing a jeweller&#x27;s shop in London. The police chase after her cab, until she crashes at the foot of the Kirke house. Jadis breaks off and tears an iron rod from a nearby lamp-post, using it to fight off police and onlookers when they mock her.

When Jadis threatens the crowd, Polly and Digory grab her and put on their rings to take her out of their worldalong with Uncle Andrew, Frank the cab-driver, and Frank&#x27;s horse, Strawberry, who were all touching each other when the children grabbed their rings. In the Wood between the Worlds, Strawberry, when attempting to drink from one of the ponds, accidentally brings everyone into another world: a dark, empty void. At first, Digory believes it to be Charn, but Jadis recognises it as a world not yet created. They then all witness the creation of a new world by the lion Aslan, who brings stars, plants, and animals into existence as he sings. Jadis, as terrified by his singing as the others are attracted to it, tries to kill Aslan with the iron rod; but it rebounds harmlessly off him, and in the creative soil of the new world it sprouts into a growing lamp-post. Jadis flees in terror.

Aslan gives some animals the power of speech, commanding them to use it for justice and merriment or else risk becoming regular animals once again. Frank the cabby and his wife Helen are then crowned King and Queen of Narnia. Aslan confronts Digory with his responsibility for bringing Jadis into his young world, and tells Digory he must atone by helping to protect the new land of Narnia from her evil. Aslan transforms Strawberry, Frank&#x27;s horse, into a winged horse called Fledge, and Digory and Polly fly on him to a distant garden high in the mountains. Digory&#x27;s task is to take an apple from a tree in this garden and plant it in Narnia. At the garden Digory finds a sign warning not to steal from the garden.

Digory picks one of the apples for his mission, but their overpowering smell tempts him. Jadis appears, having herself eaten an apple to become immortal, leaving her with pale white skin. She tempts Digory either to eat an apple himself and join her in immortality, or steal one to take back to Earth to heal his dying mother. Digory resists, knowing his mother would never condone theft, but hesitates. He sees through the Witch&#x27;s ploy when she suggests he leave Polly behindnot knowing Polly can get away by her own ring. Foiled, the Witch departs for the North, and taunts Digory for his refusal to eat the apple and gain immortality. Digory returns to Narnia and plants the apple, which grows into a mature tree behind them while the coronation proceeds. Aslan tells Digory how the tree works – anyone who steals the apples gets their heart&#x27;s desire, but in a form that renders it extremely disagreeable. In the Witch&#x27;s case, she has achieved immortality, but it only means eternal misery because of her evil heart. Moreover, the magic apples are now a horror to her, so much so that the apple tree will repel her for centuries to come, but not forever. With Aslan&#x27;s permission, Digory takes an apple from the new tree to heal his mother. Aslan returns Digory, Polly, and Uncle Andrew to England. Frank and his wife Helen (transported from England by Aslan) stay to rule Narnia as its first King and Queen. The Narnian creatures live in peace and joy, and neither the Witch nor any other enemy will come to trouble Narnia for many hundreds of years.

Digory&#x27;s apple restores his mother&#x27;s health as his father returns for good after being away on business in India, and he and Polly remain lifelong friends. Uncle Andrew reforms and gives up magic, but still enjoys bragging about his adventures with the Witch. Digory plants the apple&#x27;s core with Uncle Andrew&#x27;s rings in the back yard of his aunt&#x27;s home in London, and it grows into a large tree. Soon afterwards, Digory&#x27;s family inherits a mansion in the country, and many years later the apple tree blows down in a storm. Digory, now a middle-aged professor, has its wood made into a wardrobe, setting up the events in &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;.

==Writing==

Lewis had originally intended only to write the one Narnia novel, &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;. However, when Roger Lancelyn Green asked him how a lamp-post came to be standing in the midst of Narnian woodland, Lewis was intrigued enough by the question to attempt to find an answer by writing &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot;, which features a younger version of Professor Kirke from the first novel.

&quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot; seems to have been the most challenging Narnia novel for Lewis to write. While the other six &quot;Chronicles of Narnia&quot; books were written between 1948 and 1953, &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot; was written over a five-year period between 1949 and 1954. He started in the summer of 1949 after finishing &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;, but came to a halt after producing 26 pages of manuscript and did not resume work until two years later. This may be as a result of the autobiographical aspects of the novel, as it reflects a number of incidents and parallels very close to his own experiences.

He returned to &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot; late in 1950, after completing &quot;The Silver Chair&quot;. He managed to finish close to three-quarters of the novel, and then stopped work once again after Roger Green, to whom Lewis showed all his writing at the time, suggested there was a structural problem in the story. Finally he returned to the novel in 1953, after finishing &quot;The Last Battle&quot; in the spring of that year and completed early in 1954.

Lewis originally titled the novel &quot;Polly and Digory&quot;; his publisher changed it to &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot;. This book is dedicated to &quot;the Kilmer family&quot;.

===The Lefay Fragment===

The original opening of the novel differs greatly from the published version, and was abandoned by Lewis. It is now known as &#x27;The Lefay Fragment&#x27;, and is named after Mrs Lefay, Digory&#x27;s fairy godmother, who is mentioned in the final version as Uncle Andrew&#x27;s godmother, a less benevolent user of magic, who bequeathed him the box of dust used to create the magic rings.

In the Lefay Fragment, Digory is born with the ability to speak to (and understand) trees and animals; the distinction between Talking and non-Talking Beasts which was to become such a characteristic feature of the Narnian world is absent. Digory lives with an Aunt Gertrude, a former school mistress with an officious, bullying nature, who has ended up as a Government minister after a lifetime of belligerent brow-beating of others. Whenever his aunt is absent, Digory finds solace with the animals and trees, including a squirrel named Pattertwig. Polly enters the story as a girl next door who is unable to understand the speech of non-human creatures. She wants to build a raft to explore a stream which leads to an underground world. Digory helps construct the raft, but saws a branch from a tree necessary to complete it, in order not to lose face with Polly. This causes him to lose his supernatural powers of understanding the speech of trees and animals. The following day he is visited by his godmother Mrs Lefay who knows that Digory has lost his abilities and gives him a card with the address of a furniture shop which she instructs him to visit. At this point the fragment ends.

Pattertwig and Aunt Gertrude do not appear in the final version of the novel. Pattertwig does, however, appear as a Narnian creature in &quot;Prince Caspian&quot;, and Aunt Gertrude&#x27;s career path is retraced by the Head of Experiment House in &quot;The Silver Chair&quot;.

====Authenticity====

Some doubt has been cast on the authenticity of the Lefay Fragment, as the handwriting in the manuscript differs in some ways from Lewis&#x27;s usual style, and the writing is not of a similar calibre to his other work. Also in August 1963 Lewis had given instructions to Douglas Gresham to destroy all his unfinished or incomplete fragments of manuscript when his rooms at Magdalene College, Cambridge were being cleaned out, following his resignation from the college early in the month.

===Autobiographical elements===

A number of aspects of &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot; are parallels with Lewis&#x27;s own life. Both Digory and Lewis were children in the early 1900s, both wanted a pony, and both were faced with the death of their mothers in childhood. Digory is separated from his father, who is in India, and misses him. Lewis was educated in England after his mother&#x27;s death, while his father remained in Ireland. He also had a brother in India. Both Lewis and Digory were voracious readers as children, and both are better with books than with numbers. Digory (and Polly) struggle with sums when trying to work out how far they must travel along the attic space to explore an abandoned house, Lewis failed the maths entrance exam for Oxford University. Lewis remembered rainy summer days from his youth and Digory is faced with the same woe in the novel. Additionally Digory becomes a professor when he grows up, who takes in evacuated children during World War II.

The character of Andrew Ketterley also closely resembles Robert Capron, a schoolmaster at Wynyard School, which Lewis attended with his brother, whom Lewis suggested during his teens would make a good model for a villain in a future story. Ketterley resembles Capron in his age, appearance, and behaviour.

==Style==

&quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot; is written in a lighter tone than other &quot;Chronicles of Narnia&quot; books, in particular &quot;The Last Battle&quot;, which was published after. It frequently makes use of humour; this perhaps reflects the sense of looking back at an earlier part of the century with affection, and Lewis as a middle-aged man recalling his childhood during those years. There are a number of humorous references to life in the old days, in particular school life. Humorous exchanges also take place between Narnian animals. Jadis&#x27;s attempt to conquer London is portrayed as more comical than threatening, and further humour derives from the contrast between the evil empress and Edwardian London and its social mores, and her humiliation of bumbling Andrew Ketterley after discovering he is not as powerful a sorcerer as she is (or was). This recalls the style of Edith Nesbit&#x27;s children&#x27;s books. Lewis was fond of these books, which he read in childhood, a number were set in the same period and &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot; has some apparent references or homages to them.

==Reading order==

&quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot; was originally published as the sixth book in the &quot;Narnia Chronicles&quot;. Most reprintings of the novels until the 1980s also reflected the order of original publication. In 1980 HarperCollins published the series ordered by the chronology of the events in the novels. This meant &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot; was numbered as the first in the series. HarperCollins, which had previously published editions of the novels outside the United States, also acquired the rights to publish the novels in that country in 1994 and used this sequence in the uniform worldwide edition published in that year.

Laurence Krieg, a young fan, wrote to Lewis, asking him to adjudicate between his views of the correct sequence of reading the novels – according to the sequence of events, with &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot; being placed first – and that of his mother, who thought the order of publication was more appropriate. Lewis wrote back, appearing to support the younger Krieg&#x27;s views, although he did point out that perhaps it would not matter what order they were read in.

Some literary scholars have argued that the publication order is more effective in drawing the readers into the world of Narnia. In the book Lewis wrote first, Lucy Pevensie&#x27;s discovery of the wardrobe that opens onto a forest and a mysterious lamp-post creates a sense of suspense about an unknown land she is discovering for the first time. This would be anticlimactic if the reader has already been introduced to Narnia in &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot; and already knows the origins of Narnia, the wardrobe, and the lamp-post. Lewis scholar Peter Schakel points out that the narrative of &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot; assumes that the reader has already read &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; and is now being shown its beginnings.

Paul Ford cites several scholars who have weighed in against the decision of HarperCollins to present the books in the order of their internal chronology, and continues, &quot;most scholars disagree with this decision and find it the least faithful to Lewis&#x27;s deepest intentions&quot;. These scholars argue that the narrative of &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot; appears to assume that the reader has already read &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; and is now being shown its beginnings.

==Themes and interpretations==

===Parallels with the Book of Genesis===

Lewis suggested that he did not directly intend to write his Narnia stories as Christian tales, but that these aspects appeared subconsciously as he wrote, although the books did become Christian as they progressed. He thought that the tales were not direct representations or allegory, but that they might evoke or remind readers of Biblical stories. In &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;, Aslan is a Christ-like figure who suffers a death of atonement and returns to life in a similar way to Christ&#x27;s crucifixion and resurrection. &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot; has similar biblical allusions, reflecting aspects of the Book of Genesis such as the creation, original sin and temptation.

Parallels with events in the Book of Genesis include the forbidden fruit represented by an Apple of Life. Jadis tempts Digory to eat one of the forbidden apples in the garden, as the serpent tempts Eve into eating a forbidden fruit in the Garden of Eden; unlike Eve however, Digory rejects the offer. (Lewis&#x27;s &quot;Perelandra&quot; also features a re-enactment of the same Biblical story, which in that book also ends with the tempter foiled and the fall avoided.)

While the creation of Narnia closely echoes the creation of the Earth in the Book of Genesis, there are a number of important differences. Human beings are not created in Narnia by Aslan, they are brought into Narnia from our own world. Unlike Genesis, where souls are given only to human beings, animals and half-human half-animal creatures such as Fauns and Satyrs and even trees and watercourses are given souls and the power of rational thought and speech. This appears to suggest Lewis combined his Christian outlook with his fondness for nature, myths and fairy tales.

Parallels may also be found in Lewis&#x27;s other writings. Jadis&#x27;s references to &quot;reasons of State&quot;, and her claim to own the people of Charn and to be beyond morality, represent the eclipse of the medieval Christian belief in natural law by the political concept of sovereignty, as embodied first in royal absolutism and then in modern dictatorships. Uncle Andrew represents the Faustian element in the origins of modern science.

===The Holy Spirit and the breath of life===

On a number of occasions in the &quot;Chronicles of Narnia&quot;, Aslan uses his breath to give strength to characters, demonstrating his benevolent power of bringing life. He specifically does so in &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot; when a &quot;long warm breath&quot; gives life to Narnia. Lewis used the symbol of breath to represent the Holy Spirit, also known as the Holy Ghost. Both &quot;spirit&quot; and &quot;ghost&quot; are translations of the word for &quot;breath&quot; in Hebrew and Greek. The flash from the stars when the Narnian animals are given the ability to talk also most probably represents the Holy Spirit or &quot;breath of life&quot; of &quot;Genesis&quot; chapter 2, as well as (possibly) the scholastic concept of the divine active intellect that inspires human beings with rationality.

===Nature and a natural order===

&quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot; suggests two opposing approaches to nature, a good approach associated with Aslan as creator and an evil approach associated with human deviation from divine intentions and the harmony of a natural order. On the one hand there is the beauty of Aslan&#x27;s creation of Narnia, which is suggested as having a natural order by the use of musical harmony to bring landscapes and living things into being. There is also a distinct order to the process of creation, from earth to plants to animal, which evokes the concept of The Great Chain of Being. Lewis himself was a strong believer in the intrinsic value of nature for itself, rather than as a resource to be exploited. This is perhaps reflected in how Aslan also gives speech to spiritual aspects of nature, such as naiads in the water and dryads in the trees. Andrew Ketterley and Jadis represent an opposite, evil approach of bending the forces of nature to human will for their own gain. They see nature solely as a resource to use for their plans and thus disturb and destroy the natural order.

==Influences==
===John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;===
The sacred Garden in the west of the Narnian world is surrounded by a &quot;high wall of green turf&quot; with branches of trees overhanging it, and &quot;high gates of gold, fast shut, facing due east&quot;, which must be the only entrance because the travellers &quot;walked nearly all the way round it&quot; before they found them. In all these points Lewis echoes John Milton&#x27;s description of Eden in &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;:

:The wall of Paradise up sprung...

:And higher than that Wall a circling row
:Of goodliest trees loaden with fairest fruit,
:Blossoms and fruits at once of golden hue,
:Appeerd, with gay enameld colours mixt...

:One gate there only was, and that look&#x27;d east
:On th&#x27; other side...

Jadis takes on echoes of Satan from the same work: she climbs over the wall of the Garden in contempt of the command to enter only by the gate, and proceeds to tempt Digory as Satan tempted Eve, with lies and half-truths.

Some details of the creation of Narnia, such as the emergence of animals from the ground, and the way they shake earth from their bodies are also similar to passages in &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, and may also have been inspired by descriptions of the processes of nature in the seventh book of Edmund Spenser&#x27;s &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;.

===The Garden of the Hesperides===
Four years before the publication of the first Narnia book, Lewis had written as follows on the experience of reading really good poetry for the first time:
...I did not in the least feel that I was getting in more quantity or better quality a pleasure I had already known. It was more as if a cupboard which one had hitherto valued as a place for hanging coats proved one day, when you opened the door, to lead to the garden of the Hesperides...
The element of the cupboard leading to a new world Lewis proceeded to use in &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;, but the snowy Narnia of that book is quite unlike the balmy Garden of the Hesperides, most of whose major mythological features appear as attributes of the sacred Garden in &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot; where it differs from the Biblical or Miltonian Eden. It is set in the far West of the world; it has a watchful guardian; a hero (Digory) is sent, like Hercules, to fetch an apple from it; a female villain (Jadis) steals another of the apples, like Eris. Since the eponymous Hesperides were daughters of Hesperus, the god of the planet Venus in the evening, advocates of the planetary theory adduce this as evidence for a special association between &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot; and Venus.

===Edith Nesbit===

Lewis read Edith Nesbit&#x27;s children&#x27;s books as a child and was extremely fond of them. &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot; refers to these books in the opening of the novel as though their events were true, mentioning the setting of the piece as being when &quot;Mr. Sherlock Holmes was still living in Baker Street and the Bastables were looking for treasure in the Lewisham Road&quot;. The Bastables were children who appeared in a number of Edith Nesbit&#x27;s stories. In addition to being set in the same period and location as several of Nesbit&#x27;s stories, &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot; also has some similarities with Nesbit&#x27;s &quot;The Story of the Amulet&quot; (1906). This novel focuses on four children living in London who discover a magic amulet. Their father is away and their mother is ill, as is the case with Digory. They also manage to transport the queen of ancient Babylon to London and she is the cause of a riot; a very similar event takes place in &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot; when Polly and Digory transport Queen Jadis to London and she also causes a similar disturbance.

===J. R. R. Tolkien===

The creation of Narnia may also have been influenced by his close friend J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, which also contains a creation scene driven by the effect of music.

===Morgan Le Fay and Pandora&#x27;s Box===

Lewis greatly enjoyed stories of Arthurian legend and wrote poetry about this world. Mrs Lefay visits Digory in The Lefay Fragment, and becomes Andrew Ketterley&#x27;s nefarious godmother in the finished novel. She gives Ketterley a box from Atlantis containing the dust from which he constructs the rings Digory and Polly use to travel between worlds. Both Lefays are allusions to Morgan Le Fay, a powerful sorceress in a number of versions of King Arthur&#x27;s tales, who is often portrayed as evil. The box itself is also evocative of Pandora&#x27;s box from Greek myth, which also contained dangerous secrets.

===The Atlantis legend===

The box of dust enabling travel between worlds originated in Atlantis. Both Lewis and Tolkien were fascinated by the Atlantis legend. The degeneration of Charn&#x27;s rulers, Jadis&#x27;s ancestors, from the early kind and wise to the later cruel and arrogant is reminiscent of the similar degeneration in Tolkien&#x27;s Númenor, the fabled island kingdom that finally sank under the waves due to the sinfulness of its latter inhabitants. The world of Charn was destroyed when Jadis spoke The Deplorable Word, a form of knowledge ancient Charnian scholars feared for its destructive potential. A number of commentators believed Lewis was referring to the use of the atomic bomb, used less than a decade earlier. It is perhaps more likely that Lewis was echoing the mythical destruction of Atlantis by the forces of evil and arrogance. As noted by Alice Ward, the comparison with nuclear arms is made explicit in Aslan&#x27;s last warning: &quot;You [Earth] are growing more like it [Charn]. It is not certain that some wicked one of your race will not find out a secret as evil as The Deplorable Word and use it to destroy all living things&quot;.

==Adaptations==

===Theatrical===
Aurand Harris was a well-known American playwright for children, whose works are among the most performed in that medium. He wrote 36 plays for children including an adaption of &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot;. The play was first performed on 26 May 1984 by the Department of Drama, University of Texas, Austin and staged at the B. Iden Payne Theatre. A musical score by William Penn was written for use with productions of the play.

Erina Caradus wrote a playscript for &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot; that was performed in Dunedin, New Zealand in 2005.

===Film===
An agreement among representatives of 20th Century Fox, Walden, and the C. S. Lewis estate determined that &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot; would be the basis for the next film following the release of the 2010 film &quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot;. However, in October 2011, Douglas Gresham confirmed that Walden Media&#x27;s contract with the C. S. Lewis estate had expired.

On 1 October 2013, the C.S. Lewis Company announced that they had entered into an agreement with producer Mark Gordon to jointly develop and produce &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia: The Silver Chair&quot;, ultimately deciding to continue releasing the films to mirror the novel series&#x27; publication order.

In October 2018, Netflix announced an agreement with the C.S. Lewis Company. Netflix will develop and produce new series and movies based on &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot;. Mark Gordon of Entertainment One, Douglas Gresham and Vincent Sieber will serve as producers for films and executive producers for series.

===TV===
In 2003, the BBC produced a 10-part version read by Jane Lapotaire and signed by Jean St Clair wearing different Narnia-like clothes in British Sign Language, for the TV series &quot;Hands Up!&quot; which was first broadcast on the 16 January 2003. Jean signed in front of various high quality illustrations representing parts of the novel. It was later repeated on CBBC on the 3 December 2007, and BBC Two on the 16 September 2008.

===Radio===
A BBC Radio 4 adaptation exists. Focus on the Family also made an adaptation of this book with a full cast, sound editing, and music. Both productions adapted all seven books.

===Manga===
A HarperCollins Japan manga adaptation, , began publication in 2018, before concluding in 2020 after two volumes.

==Critical reception==
T.M. Wagner of SF Reviews said &quot;&quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot; may not be the best of the Narnia novels, but it&#x27;s a brisk and funny tale certain to delight its intended young audience&quot;, saying that it may not satisfy readers in their teenage years and older.

Jandy&#x27;s Reading Room reviewed the book, saying that although they feel it is the weakest of the series, they would still recommend it. They say it &quot;gives a wonderful picture of the beginning of a new world, in the manner of the Creation.&quot;

<doc id="53075" wikidata="Q1686582" url="?curid=53075" title="Jehuda Cresques">
<text>Jehudà Cresques (, 1360-1410), also known as Jafudà Cresques, Jaume Riba, and Cresques lo Juheu (&quot;Cresques the Jew&quot;), was a &quot;converso&quot; cartographer from &quot;Majorca&quot; in the early 15th century.

== Biography ==
The son of Abraham Cresques, a famous Jewish cartographer, he was born in a Jewish family in Majorca, in the Majorcan-Catalan speaking part of Crown of Aragon, in present-day Spain. Together he and his father were the probable authors of the famous Catalan Atlas of 1375.

Cresques&#x27; work was highly sought after. In 1390 John I of Aragon paid 60 livres and 8 sous for one of his maps. After the Aragonese persecutions of 1391 he was forcibly converted to Christianity, at which time he took the name Jaume Riba, Jacobus Ribus, in Latin. He appears to have remained in Majorca for a considerable time and to have become known to the people there as &quot;&quot;lo jueu buscoler&quot;, the map Jew, or &quot;el jueu de les bruixoles&quot;&quot;, the compass Jew.

=== &#x27;Mestre Jacome&#x27; ===
It has long been believed that Jehuda Cresques is the same person as &#x27;Mestre Jacome&#x27;, a Majorcan cartographer induced by the Portuguese prince Henry the Navigator to move to Portugal in the 1420s to train Portuguese map-makers in Majorcan-style cartography. &#x27;Jacome of Majorca&#x27; was described as the head of Henry&#x27;s legendary observatory and &quot;school&quot; at Sagres by Samuel Purchas.

The identification of &quot;Mestre Jacome&quot; with Jehuda Cresques&quot; is principally due to the Catalan historian Gonzalo de Reparaz (1930).
More recent research argues that Jehuda Cresques was dead by 1410, and &quot;Mestre Jacome&quot; must have been someone else, identity still indeterminate - Majorca had many skilled Jewish cartographers.

<doc id="53076" wikidata="Q14581" url="?curid=53076" title="Darwin (operating system)">
<text>Darwin is the core Unix-like operating system of macOS, iOS, watchOS, tvOS, iPadOS, audioOS, visionOS, and bridgeOS. It previously existed as an independent open-source operating system, first released by Apple Inc. in 2000. It is composed of code derived from NeXTSTEP, FreeBSD, other BSD operating systems, Mach, and other free software projects&#x27; code, as well as code developed by Apple. Darwin&#x27;s unofficial mascot is Hexley the Platypus.

Darwin is mostly POSIX-compatible, but has never, by itself, been certified as compatible with any version of POSIX. Starting with Leopard, macOS has been certified as compatible with the Single UNIX Specification version 3 (SUSv3).

==History==

The heritage of Darwin began with Unix derivatives supplemented by aspects of NeXT&#x27;s NeXTSTEP operating system (later, since version 4.0, known as OPENSTEP), first released in 1989. After Apple bought NeXT in 1996, it announced it would base its next operating system on OPENSTEP. This was developed into Rhapsody in 1997, Mac OS X Server 1.0 in 1999, Mac OS X Public Beta in 2000, and Mac OS X 10.0 in 2001.

In 1999, Apple announced it would release the source code for the Mach 2.5 microkernel, BSD Unix 4.4 OS, and the Apache Web server components of Mac OS X Server. At the time, interim CEO Steve Jobs alluded to British naturalist Charles Darwin by announcing &quot;because it&#x27;s about evolution&quot;. In 2000, the core operating system components of Mac OS X were released as open-source software under the Apple Public Source License (APSL) as Darwin; the higher-level components, such as the Cocoa and Carbon frameworks, remained closed-source.

Up to Darwin 8.0.1, released in April 2005, Apple released a binary installer (as an ISO image) after each major Mac OS X release that allowed one to install Darwin on PowerPC and Intel x86 systems as a standalone operating system. Minor updates were released as packages that were installed separately. Darwin is now only available as source code. As of January 2023, Apple no longer mentions Darwin by name on its Open Source website and only publishes an incomplete collection of open-source projects relating to macOS and iOS.

==Design==
===Kernel===

The kernel of Darwin is XNU, a hybrid kernel which uses OSFMK 7.3 (Open Software Foundation Mach Kernel) from the OSF, various elements of FreeBSD (including the process model, network stack, and virtual file system), and an object-oriented device driver API called I/O Kit. The hybrid kernel design provides the flexibility of a microkernel and the performance of a monolithic kernel.

===Hardware and software support===
The last bootable full release of Darwin supported 32-bit and 64-bit Apple PowerPC systems and 32-bit Intel PCs.

Darwin currently includes support for the 64-bit x86-64 variant of the Intel x86 processors used in Intel-based Macs and the 64-bit ARM processors used in the iPhone 5S and later, the 6th generation iPod Touch, the 5th generation iPad and later, the iPad Air family, the iPad Mini 2 and later, the iPad Pro family, the fourth generation and later Apple TVs, the HomePod family, and Macs with Apple silicon such as the 2020 Apple M1 Macs, as well as the Raspberry Pi 3B. An open-source port of the XNU kernel exists that supports Darwin on Intel and AMD x86 platforms not officially supported by Apple, though it does not appear to have been updated since 2009. An open-source port of the XNU kernel also exists for ARM platforms, though it has not been updated since 2016. Older versions supported some or all of 32-bit PowerPC, 64-bit PowerPC, 32-bit x86, and 32-bit ARM.

It supports the POSIX API by way of its BSD lineage (largely FreeBSD userland), so a large number of programs written for various other UNIX-like systems can be compiled on Darwin with no changes to the source code.

Darwin does not include many of the defining elements of macOS, such as the Carbon and Cocoa APIs or the Quartz Compositor and Aqua user interface, and thus cannot run Mac applications. It does, however, support a number of lesser-known features of macOS, such as mDNSResponder, which is the multicast DNS responder and a core component of the Bonjour networking technology, and launchd, an advanced service management framework.

==License==
In July 2003, Apple released Darwin under version 2.0 of the Apple Public Source License (APSL), which the Free Software Foundation (FSF) classifies as a free software license incompatible with the GNU General Public License. Previous versions were released under an earlier version of the APSL license, which did not meet the FSF definition of free software, although it did meet the requirements of the Open Source Definition.

==Release history==
The following is a table of major Darwin releases with their dates of release and their derivative operating system releases. Note that the corresponding releases may have been released on a different date.

===Darwin 0–8 and corresponding Mac OS X releases===

The jump in version numbers from Darwin 1.4.1 to 5.1 with the release of Mac OS X v10.1.1 was designed to tie Darwin to the Mac OS X version and build numbering system, which in turn is inherited from NeXTSTEP. In the build numbering system of macOS, every version has a unique beginning build number, which identifies what whole version of macOS it is part of. Mac OS X v10.0 had build numbers starting with 4, 10.1 had build numbers starting with 5, and so forth (earlier build numbers represented developer releases).

===Darwin 9; iPhone OS introduced===
===Darwin 10-11; iPhone OS rebranded to iOS===
===Darwin 12–15; Mac OS X rebranded into OS X===
===Darwin 16–19; OS X rebranded into macOS===
===Darwin 20 onwards===
&quot;Note: the tables above contain the release dates of the corresponding OS releases. Build dates for Darwin versions are not publicly available; the commands below only give the build date for the XNU kernel.&quot;

The command in Terminal will show the Darwin version number (&quot;20.3.0&quot;), and the command will show the XNU build version string, which includes the Darwin version number.
The command will show the corresponding ProductName (&quot;macOS&quot;), the ProductVersion number (&quot;11.2.3&quot;) and the BuildVersion string (&quot;20D91&quot;).

==Derived projects==
Due to the free software nature of Darwin, there have been projects that aim to modify or enhance the operating system.

===OpenDarwin===
OpenDarwin was a community-led operating system based on the Darwin system. It was founded in April 2002 by Apple Inc. and Internet Systems Consortium. Its goal was to increase collaboration between Apple developers and the free software community. Apple benefited from the project because improvements to OpenDarwin would be incorporated into Darwin releases; and the free/open-source community benefited from being given complete control over its own operating system, which could then be used in free software distributions such as GNU-Darwin.

On July 25, 2006, the OpenDarwin team announced that the project was shutting down, as they felt OpenDarwin had &quot;become a mere hosting facility for Mac OS X related projects&quot;, and that the efforts to create a standalone Darwin operating system had failed. They also state: &quot;Availability of sources, interaction with Apple representatives, difficulty building and tracking sources, and a lack of interest from the community have all contributed to this.&quot; The last stable release was version 7.2.1, released on July 16, 2004.

===PureDarwin===
PureDarwin is a project to create a bootable operating system image from Apple&#x27;s released source code for Darwin. Since the halt of OpenDarwin and the release of bootable images since Darwin 8.x, it has been increasingly difficult to create a full operating system as many components became closed source. In 2015 the project created a preview release based on Darwin 9 with an X11 GUI, followed by a command-line only 17.4 Beta based on Darwin 17.

===Other derived projects===

* XQuartz is a component of the X Window System that runs on macOS (Darwin). XDarwin, before the introduction of Apple&#x27;s X11.app.
* GNUstep is a free software implementation of the Cocoa (formerly OpenStep) Objective-C frameworks, widget toolkit, and application development tools for Unix-like operating systems.
* Window Maker, a window manager designed to emulate the NeXT GUI as part of the wider GNUstep project.
* WebKit is a browser engine primarily used in Apple&#x27;s Safari web browser, as well as all web browsers on iOS and iPadOS.
* MacPorts (formerly DarwinPorts), Fink, and Homebrew are projects to port UNIX programs to the Darwin operating system and provide package management. In addition, several standard UNIX package managers—such as RPM, pkgsrc, and Portage—have Darwin ports. Some of these operate in their own namespace so as not to interfere with the base system.
* GNU-Darwin was a project that ports packages of free software to Darwin. They package OS images in a way similar to a Linux distribution.
* The Darwine project was a port of Wine that allows one to run Microsoft Windows software on Darwin.
* SEDarwin was a port of TrustedBSD mandatory access control framework and portions of the SELinux framework to Darwin. It was incorporated into Mac OS X 10.5.
* The Darbat project was an experimental port of Darwin to the L4 microkernel family. It aims to be binary compatible with existing Darwin binaries.
* The Darling project is a compatibility layer for running macOS binaries on Linux systems. It uses some Darwin source code.
* There are various projects that focus on driver support: e.g., wireless drivers, wired NIC drivers modem drivers, card readers, and the ext2 and ext3 file systems.
* DarwinBSD Project is a Darwin project using pkgsrc for packages. It is an open source project.

<doc id="53081" wikidata="Q675398" url="?curid=53081" title="History of El Salvador">
<text>The history of El Salvador begins with several distinct groups of Mesoamerican people, especially the Pipil, the Lenca and the Maya. In the early 16th century, the Spanish Empire conquered the territory, incorporating it into the Viceroyalty of New Spain ruled from Mexico City. In 1821, El Salvador achieved independence from Spain as part of the First Mexican Empire, only to further secede as part of the Federal Republic of Central America two years later. Upon the republic&#x27;s independence in 1841, El Salvador became a sovereign state until forming a short-lived union with Honduras and Nicaragua called the Greater Republic of Central America, which lasted from 1895 to 1898.

In the 20th century, El Salvador endured chronic political and economic instability characterized by coups, revolts, and a succession of authoritarian rulers caused by the intervention of the United States. Persistent socioeconomic inequality and civil unrest culminated in the devastating Salvadoran Civil War in the 1980s, which was fought between the military-led government and a coalition of left-wing guerrilla groups. The conflict ended in 1992 with a negotiated settlement that established a multiparty constitutional republic, which remains in place to this day.

El Salvador&#x27;s economy was historically dominated by agriculture, beginning with the indigo plant (&quot;añil&quot; in Spanish), the most important crop during the colonial period, and followed thereafter by coffee, which by the early 20th century accounted for 90 percent of export earnings.

==Pre-Columbian history==
Before the Spanish conquest, the area that is known as El Salvador was composed of three indigenous states and several principalities. In central El Salvador were the indigenous inhabitants, the Pipils, or the Pipiles, a tribe of nomadic Nahua people that were settled there for a long time. The Pipil strongly resisted Spanish efforts to extend their dominion southward.

The eastern region was populated and governed by the Lenca people, while the northern zone of the Lempa River was populated and governed by the Chʼortiʼ, a Mayan people. Their culture was similar to that of their Aztecs and Maya neighbors.

Several archaeological sites dating to 1400 years ago have been discovered preserved beneath 6 m (20 ft) of volcanic ash.

==Spanish conquest (1524–1525)==

The first Spanish attempt to control El Señorío of Cuzcatlán failed in 1524, when Pedro de Alvarado was forced to retreat by Pipil warriors led by King Atlácatl and Prince Atonal in the Battle of Acajutla. In 1525, he returned and succeeded in bringing the district under control of the Audiencia of Mexico. Land- Environmental Impact was dry and cold around this time

==Spanish colonial period (1525–1821)==
After the Spanish conquest, the region became part of the Captaincy General of Guatemala. Pedro de Alvarado was the first governor, a position he held until his death in 1541. The area was briefly (from 1538 to 1543) under the authority of a short-lived Real Audiencia of Panama, after which most of Central America was placed under a new Real Audiencia of Guatemala. During this period, the region was divided into the province of San Salvador, the province of San Miguel, and the province of Izalcos.

In 1579 the province of San Salvador became an alcaldía mayor (great mayor&#x27;s office). In 1786 it became an intendancy and in 1821 it became a province with a provincial council. In 1824, San Salvador and Sonsonate were united into the State of Salvador (within the Federal Republic of Central America).

==Struggle for independence (1821-1841)==
In the early 19th century, Napoleon&#x27;s occupation of Spain led to the outbreak of revolts across Spanish America. All of the fighting by those seeking independence was done in the center of New Spain from 1810 to 1821, in what is currently central Mexico. After the viceroy was defeated in Mexico City in 1821, news of the independence was sent to all the territories of New Spain including the intendancies of the former Captaincy General of Guatemala.

The public proclamation was done through the 1821 Act of Independence of Central America. After the declaration of independence, the parliament of New Spain intended to establish a commonwealth whereby the King of Spain, Ferdinand VII, would also be Emperor of New Spain, but in which both countries would be governed by separate laws and with their own legislative offices. Should the king refuse the position, the law provided for another member of the House of Bourbon to accede to the throne of New Spain. Ferdinand VII, however, did not recognize the independence of New Spain and said that Spain would not allow any other European prince to take the throne of New Spain.

Parliament proclaimed Agustín de Iturbide emperor of New Spain on 19 May 1822 and renamed New Spain as the Mexican Empire. The territory of the Mexican Empire included the continental intendancies and provinces of New Spain proper, including those of the former Captaincy General of Guatemala.

El Salvador, fearing incorporation into Mexico, petitioned the United States government for statehood. But in 1823, a revolution in Mexico ousted Emperor Agustín de Iturbide and a new Mexican congress voted to allow the Central American intendancies to decide their own fate. That year, the Federal Republic of Central America (FRCA) was formed of the five Central American intendancies under General Manuel José Arce. The intendancies became states under the FRCA.

In 1832, Anastasio Aquino led an indigenous revolt against criollos and mestizos in Santiago Nonualco, a small town in the province of La Paz. The source of the discontent of the indigenous people was the constant abuse and the lack of land to cultivate. The problem of land distribution has been the source of many political conflicts in Salvadoran history.

The FRCA was dissolved in February 1841, and El Salvador gained recognition as an independent republic on 18 February 1841.

==Rise of the oligarchy==
In the early 19th century, El Salvador&#x27;s economy depended on the production of a single export crop, indigo. This led wealthy landowners to be attracted to certain lands while leaving other lands, especially those around former volcanic eruptions, to the poor and indigenous communities for subsistence farming. In the late 19th century, natural indigo was replaced by synthetic chemical dyes. The landed elite replaced this crop with a newly demanded product, coffee.

The lands that had been left by the wealthy landowners to the poor and indigenous communities were suddenly quite valuable. The elite-controlled legislature and president passed vagrancy laws that removed people from their land and the great majority of Salvadorans became landless, as their former lands were absorbed into the new coffee plantations (&quot;fincas&quot;). Historian Héctor Lindo-Fuentes asserts that &quot;the parallel process of state-building and expansion of the coffee industry resulted in the formation of an oligarchy that was to rule El Salvador during the twentieth century.&quot;

The coffee industry gave birth to an oligarchy in the late 19th century, which has controlled most of the land and wealth of El Salvador since that time. The Fourteen Families (&quot;las catorce familias&quot;)—with names including de Sola, Llach, Hill, Meza-Ayau, Duenas, Dalton, Regalado, Quiñonez, Flores, and Salaverria—is a reference to this oligarchy. For much of this time, this oligarchy acted in a manner similar to the overlords of the feudal system that existed in Europe during the Middle Ages. Although the constitution was amended repeatedly in favor of the oligarchs (in 1855, 1864, 1871, 1872, 1880, 1883, and 1886), several elements remained constant throughout. The wealthy landowners were granted super-majority power in the national legislature and economy. For example, the 1824 constitution provided for a unicameral legislature of 70 deputies, in which 42 seats were set aside for the landowners. The president was selected from the landed elite. Each of El Salvador&#x27;s 14 regional departments had a governor appointed by the president. The frequent changes in the constitution were mainly due to the attempts of various presidents to hold onto power. For example, President Gerardo Barrios created a new constitution to extend his term limit.

From 1931 until the early 1980s, El Salvador was governed by various dictatorships, but these governments were subservient to the oligarchy, with some officials deriving “modest wealth from bureaucratic corruption”. At that time, the oligarchy consisted of some 20 families which controlled more than 70 percent of El Salvador&#x27;s coffee production and exports, sugar mills, banks, television and newspapers. Since the end of that war in 1992, the oligarchic families of El Salvador have shifted their focus from agricultural exports to capital investment. Today, the majority of El Salvador&#x27;s capital is distributed among eight powerful business conglomerates. These companies (Grupo Cuscatlán, Banagrícola, Banco Davivienda El Salvador, Banco de Comercio, Grupo Agrisal, Grupo Poma, Grupo de Sola, and Grupo Hill) dominate the economy of El Salvador and they are largely owned by the descendants of the original 14 families of the coffee oligarchy.

==Military dictatorships (1931–1979)==

Between 1931, the year of General Maximiliano Hernández Martínez&#x27;s coup, and 1944, when he was deposed, there was brutal suppression of rural resistance. The most notable event was the 1932 Salvadoran peasant uprising headed by Farabundo Martí, Chief Feliciano Ama from the Izalco tribe and Chief Francisco &quot;Chico&quot; Sanchez from Juayúa, Izalco subdivision. The government retaliation, commonly referred to as &quot;La Matanza&quot; (“the slaughter”), which followed days of protest. In this &#x27;Matanza&#x27;, between 10,000 and 40,000 indigenous people and political opponents were murdered, imprisoned or exiled.

From 1931 until 1982, was ruled by either a military dictator or a joint civilian-military dictatorship and its economy was based primarily on the cultivation and exportation of coffee. These authoritarian governments employed political repression to maintain power, despite the appearance of democracy.

Throughout the 1970s, there was great political instability in El Salvador. In the 1972 presidential election, opponents of military rule united under José Napoleón Duarte, leader of the Christian Democratic Party (PDC). Amid widespread fraud, Duarte&#x27;s broad-based reform movement was defeated. Subsequent protests and an attempted coup were crushed and Duarte was exiled. These events eroded hope of reform through democratic means and persuaded those opposed to the government that armed insurrection was the only way to achieve change.

==Salvadoran Civil War (1979–1992)==
In 1979 the reformist Revolutionary Government Junta took power. Both the far right and the far left political wings disagreed with the new government and increased political violence rapidly developed into a civil war. The initially poorly trained Armed Forces of El Salvador (ESAF) engaged in repression and indiscriminate killings, the most notorious of which was the El Mozote massacre in December 1981. The United States supported the government, while Cuba and other Communist states supported the insurgents—now organized as the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN). The Chapultepec Peace Accords marked the end of the war in 1992, and the FMLN became one of the major political parties.

In accordance with the peace agreements, the constitution was amended to prohibit the military from playing an internal security role except under extraordinary circumstances. Demobilization of Salvadoran military forces generally proceeded on schedule throughout the peace process. The Treasury Police, National Guard, and National Police were abolished, and military intelligence functions were transferred to civilian control. By 1993—nine months ahead of schedule—the military had cut personnel from a war-time high of 63,000 to the level of 32,000 required by the peace accords.

By 1999, ESAF strength stood at less than 15,000, including uniformed and non-uniformed personnel. A purge of military officers accused of human rights abuses and corruption was completed in 1993 in compliance with the Ad Hoc Commission&#x27;s recommendations. The new doctrine, professionalism, and complete withdrawal from political and economic affairs leave the ESAF as one of the most respected institutions in El Salvador.

More than 35,000 eligible beneficiaries from among the former guerrillas and soldiers who fought in the war received land under the peace accord-mandated land transfer program, which ended in January 1997. The majority of these also received agricultural credits.

The democratic process in El Salvador is delicately balanced, since the Legislative Assembly decreed an amnesty after the Chapultepec Peace Accords. As a result of this amnesty, no one responsible for crimes carried out before, during and after the war has been convicted.

==Post-war period (1992–2019)==

The FMLN participated in the 1994 presidential election as a political party. Armando Calderón Sol, the ARENA candidate, won the election. During his rule, Calderón Sol implemented neoliberal policies, including the privatization of several large state enterprises. The FMLN emerged strengthened from the legislative and municipal elections of 1997, where they won the mayoralty of San Salvador. However, internal divisions in the process of electing a presidential candidate damaged the party&#x27;s image. ARENA again won the presidency in the election of March 7, 1999, with its candidate Francisco Flores Pérez.

In the presidential elections of March 21, 2004, ARENA was victorious again, this time with the candidate Antonio Saca, securing the party&#x27;s third consecutive term. In the same election, economist Ana Vilma de Escobar became El Salvador&#x27;s first female vice president. The election result also marked the end of the minor parties (PCN, PDC, and CD), which failed get the 3% required by electoral law to maintain their registration as parties.

In the postwar period, El Salvador experienced problems with organized crime in the form of “maras” or gangs, mainly due to the deportation of Salvadorans from the United States. Two law enforcement programs created to combat this problem–La Mano Dura and Mano Superdura–have failed.

Currently, El Salvador&#x27;s largest source of foreign currency is remittances sent by Salvadorans from abroad; these have been estimated at over $2 billion US dollars. There are over 2 million Salvadorans living abroad in countries including the United States, Canada, Mexico, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Australia, and Sweden.

In the 2009 presidential elections, FMLN candidate Mauricio Funes, a former journalist, won the presidency. This was the first victory of a leftist political party in El Salvador&#x27;s history. Funes took over as president on June 1, 2009, together with Salvador Sánchez Cerén as vice president.

In 2014, Cerén took office as president, after winning the election as the candidate of the left-wing FMLN. Cerén had been a guerrilla leader in the Civil War and is the first ex-rebel to serve as president. Under his leadership, El Salvador became the first country in the world to ban the mining of metal on its territory, for environmental and public health reasons.

===Corrupt presidents===
Former President Mauricio Funes fled to Nicaragua in 2014 after being charged with illicit enrichment and money laundering. In 2017, an El Salvador court ruled that Funes and one of his sons had illegally enriched themselves. Funes was still living in Nicaragua as of 2019. Funes was also sentenced in 2023 to 14 years in prison in absentia because of negotiations related to the gang truces he made while serving as president. He was sentenced to an additional six years for tax evasion, and he was also placed under sanctions by the U.S. State Department.

In 2018, former President Antonio Saca was sentenced to 10 years in prison after he pleaded guilty to diverting more than US$300 million in state funds to his own businesses and third parties.

In 2023, former President Salvador Sánchez Cerén was sanctioned by the U.S. State Department for &quot;significant corruption by laundering money&quot; during his tenure as vice president.

==2019-present==

In February, 2019, Nayib Bukele, a Millennial who was not aligned with either of the major parties that had dominated the country since the Civil War, was elected president of El Salvador.

According to a report by the International Crisis Group (ICG) 2020, the homicide rate in El Salvador declined by as much as 60 percent since Bukele became president in June 2019. This phenomenon could be related to the informal “non-aggression agreement” between the government and certain of the maras.

President Nayib Bukele remains very popular among the citizens. According to a survey, 96 percent of respondents said he was doing a “good” or “very good&quot; job. El Salvador&#x27;s legislative elections was an important breakthrough in February 2021. Nuevas Ideas (New Ideas)—the new party founded by Bukele—won around two-thirds of votes with its allies (GANA-New Ideas). Nuevas Ideas won a supermajority of 56 seats in the 84-seat parliament. This supermajority enabled President Bukele to appoint judges and pass laws (for example, to remove presidential term limits). In September 2021, El Salvador&#x27;s Supreme Court decided to allow Bukele to run for a second term in 2024, despite the constitution prohibits the president to serve two consecutive terms in office. The decision was organized by judges appointed to the court by President Bukele.

In 2021, El Salvador adopted the Bitcoin as its legal tender under the direction of Bukele. Its value at the time was equivalent to US$52,000. In January 2022, The International Monetary Fund (IMF) urged El Salvador to reverse its decision to make cryptocurrency Bitcoin legal tender. Bitcoin had rapidly lost about half of its value, meaning economic difficulties for El Salvador. President Bukele had announced his plans to build a Bitcoin city at the base of a volcano in El Salvador.
In March 2024, BitCoin&#x27;s value has rebounded, exceeding its previous high value to over US$64,700.

In 2022, Salvadoran government initiated a massive fight against criminal gangs and gang-related violence. State of emergency was declared on 27 March. It was extended on 20 July. More than 53,000 suspected gang members were arrested. This has resulted in significant declines in homicide, extortion, and other gang-related crimes.

In January 2024, it was announced that homicide rate dropped nearly 70% year over year, with 495 homicides in 2022 compared to 154 in 2023.

On 4 February 2024, President Nayib Bukele, won re-election with 83% of the vote in general election. His party Nuevas Ideas (New Ideas) won 58 of the El Salvador parliament&#x27;s 60 seats. On 1 June 2024, President Nayib Bukele was sworn in for the second five-year term.
