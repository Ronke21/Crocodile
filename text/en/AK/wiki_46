<text>The Supercars Championship, currently known as the Repco Supercars Championship under sponsorship, is a touring car racing category in Australia and New Zealand, running as an International Series under Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA) regulations, governing the sport.

Supercars events take place in all Australian states and the Northern Territory, with the Australian Capital Territory formerly holding the Canberra 400. Usually, an international round is held in New Zealand, with events previously being held in China, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, and the United States. The Melbourne SuperSprint championship event is also held in support of the Australian Grand Prix. Race formats vary between each event, with sprint races between in length, street races between in length, and two-driver endurance races held at Sandown and Bathurst. The series is broadcast in 137 countries and has an average event attendance of over 100,000. With over 250,000 in attendance annually, the Adelaide 500 is the most attended Supercars race in Australia.

The vehicles used in the series are loosely based on road-going cars. Cars are custom made using a control chassis, with only certain body panels being common between the road cars and race cars. The cars are controlled for &quot;technical parity&quot; - ensuring that teams and drivers using any of the homologated cars have a chance to build and drive a winning car.

All cars currently use either a 5.4L or 5.7L Naturally aspirated V8 engine. Originally only for Ford Falcons and Holden Commodores, the new generation V8 Supercar regulations, introduced in 2013, opened up the series to more manufacturers. Nissan were the first new manufacturer to commit to the series with four Nissan Altima L33s followed briefly by Erebus Motorsport with Mercedes-Benz E63 AMGs and Garry Rogers Motorsport with Volvo S60s. The series returned to a Ford and Holden duopoly in 2020 with the departure of Nissan, while Ford replaced the Falcon with the Mustang in 2019. Holden announced its final year of competition in 2022, to be replaced by the Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 for the 2023 season. Starting in 2026, Toyota will make its debut in the championship, competing with the GR Supra.

==History==
===Group 3A===

The concept of a formula centred around V8-engined Fords and Holdens for the Australian Touring Car Championship had been established as early as mid-1991. With the new regulations set to come into effect in 1993, Ford and Holden were both keen to know the details of the new formula by the end of 1991, putting pressure on the Confederation of Australian Motor Sport (CAMS) to provide clarity on the matter. However, CAMS was waiting to see what the FIA did with its proposed international formula for 2.5- and 2.0-litre touring cars.

The new rules for the ATCC were announced in November 1991 and indicated that the V8 cars would be significantly faster than the smaller-engined cars. In 1992, CAMS looked at closing the performance gap between the classes, only to have protests from Ford and Holden, which did not want to see their cars beaten by the smaller cars. In June 1992, the class structure was confirmed:

* Class A: Australian-produced 5.0-litre V8-engined Fords and Holdens
* Class B: 2.0-litre cars complying with FIA Class II Touring Car regulations
* Class C: normally aspirated two-wheel drive cars complying with 1992 CAMS Group 3A Touring Car regulations:This class would only be eligible in 1993.

Both the Ford Falcon EB and Holden Commodore VP ran American-based engines, which were restricted to 7,500 rpm and a compression ratio of 10:1. The Holden teams had the option of using the Group A-developed 5.0-litre Holden V8 engine, although this was restricted to the second-tier privateer teams from 1994 onwards, forcing the major Holden runners to use the more expensive Chevrolet engine. The V8s were first eligible to compete in the endurance races of 1992. The distinctive aerodynamics package, consisting of large front and rear spoilers, was designed partly with this in mind, to give the new cars a better chance of beating the Nissan Skyline GT-Rs in those races.

The new rules meant that cars such as the turbocharged Nissan Skyline GT-R and Ford Sierra RS500 Cosworth were not eligible to compete in 1993, while cars such as the BMW M3 were. However, the M3 received few of the liberal concessions given to the new V8s and also had an extra added to its minimum weight, so with the Class C cars eligible for 1993 only, the German manufacturer&#x27;s attention switched to the 2.0-litre class for 1994.

Cars from all three classes would contest the 1993 Australian Touring Car Championship, as well as non-championship Australian touring car events such as the Bathurst 1000. However, for the purposes of race classification and points allocation, cars competed in two classes:
* Over 2,000 cc
* Under 2,000 cc

Originally, the 2.0-litre class cars competed in a separate race to the V8s. This was changed for the second round of 1993 after only nine entrants were in the 2.0-litre class for the first round at Amaroo Park.

With the new regulations intended to be a parity formula, protests by the Holden teams indicated that the Fords had an aerodynamic advantage after they won the opening three rounds, beating the Commodores comprehensively. After round five at Winton, Holden was granted a new front and rear wing package. The BMWs were also allowed new splitters and full DTM-specification rear wings. Disparity between the Fords and Holdens continued to be a talking point during the next few years, with various concessions given to each manufacturer to try to equalise the two cars.

From 1995, the 2.0-litre cars, now contesting their own series as super touring cars, became ineligible for the Australian Touring Car Championship. They did not contest the endurance races at Sandown and Bathurst, leaving these open solely to the 5.0-litre Ford and Holden models.

===V8 Supercars===
The Australian Vee Eight Super Car Company (AVESCO) – a joint venture between the Touring Car Entrants Group of Australia (TEGA), sports promoters IMG and the Australian Motor Sports Commission – was formed in November 1996 to run the series. This set the foundation for the large expansion of the series during the following years. The category also adopted the name &#x27;V8 Supercars&#x27; at this time, though the cars themselves were much unchanged. A new television deal with Network Ten and Fox Sports was organised, although this had follow-on effects for the Bathurst 1000 later in the year.

In February, Tony Cochrane and James Erskine left IMG. Together with David Coe, they formed Sports and Entertainment Limited (SEL) in April 1997. TEGA would have a 75% share in AVESCO, with SEL owning the other 25%. TEGA was responsible for the rules and technical management of the series and the supply of cars and drivers, while SEL was responsible for capturing and maintaining broadcasting rights, sponsorship, licensing, and sanction agreements.

The expansion of the series began in 1998, with the first round to be held in the Northern Territory taking place at Hidden Valley Raceway. In 1999, a new street race on a shortened version of the Adelaide Grand Prix Circuit became one of the first festival-style events, which would become common in later years. Australia&#x27;s capital city, Canberra, hosted its first event on the Canberra Street Circuit in 2000. In 2001, a championship round was held in New Zealand for the first time, at Pukekohe Park Raceway. In 2002, the V8 Supercar support event at the Indy 300 on the Gold Coast became a championship round, having been a non-championship event since 1994.

Major format changes were made for 1999, with the incorporation of the endurance races into the championship. Control tyres were used for the first time, with Bridgestone selected as the supplier. The series was also renamed from the &quot;Australian Touring Car Championship&quot; to the &quot;Shell Championship Series&quot;, by virtue of Shell&#x27;s sponsorship of the category. Reverse-grid races were introduced for multiple rounds in 2000 before being confined to just the Canberra round for 2001. Also in 2001, compulsory pit stops were introduced at certain rounds and the Top Ten Shootout was used at all rounds. The control tyre supplier changed from Bridgestone to Dunlop in 2002 and the series name was changed to the &quot;V8 Supercar Championship Series&quot; after Shell discontinued their sponsorship.

====Project Blueprint====
Discussions about parity had returned in 2000, with trimmed from the front spoiler of the Commodore after Holden, in particular, the Holden Racing Team, had dominated in 1998 and 1999. This was in response to the removed from the Falcon in previous seasons, and coincided with a trim from the Falcon&#x27;s rear spoiler. The small reduction for the Holden teams was quickly addressed with both cars receiving the same front splitter shortly afterwards, but the Falcon&#x27;s rear wing remained trimmed. Ford had threatened to withdraw from the series, but nothing came of this. After Holden again dominated in 2001 and 2002, a new set of regulations, dubbed &quot;Project Blueprint&quot;, was introduced in 2003 to close the performance gap between the Commodore and the Falcon, thus creating closer, fairer racing. Project Blueprint was developed by Paul Taylor and Wayne Cattach, who spent two years designing a formula which would eliminate most of the differences between the Fords and Holdens.

Project Blueprint had the chassis pick-up points, wheelbase, track, and driving position become common across both manufacturers. The Holdens were now able and required to use double-wishbone front suspension, similar to that of the Falcon, rather than the MacPherson struts used previously, and a Watts link at the rear rather than a Panhard. The aerodynamic packages were comprehensively tested and revised and differences in the porting of each of the manufacturers&#x27; engines were also removed. The performance of the new Ford BA Falcon and Holden VY and VZ Commodores was fairly even for the next four years, with Ford winning the championship in 2003, 2004, and 2005 and Holden winning in 2006. Reverse-grid races were used at certain events in 2006 before unpopularity with the drivers, teams, and fans saw them abolished halfway through the season.

The Holden VE Commodore caused controversy when it was introduced in 2007. The production model was longer, wider, and taller than the rival Ford BF Falcon and outside of the limits set by Project Blueprint. As a result, the VE race car was granted custom bodywork – namely shortened rear doors and a lowered roofline to meet the regulations. Despite this, the VE was approved for use in the series, along with the BF Falcon, after several months of preseason testing. Sequential gearboxes were introduced in 2008 and became compulsory by the end of the year. In 2009, E85 (a fuel consisting of 85% ethanol and 15% unleaded petrol) was introduced in an effort to improve the environmental image of the sport. Carbon dioxide emissions decreased by up to 50%, but fuel consumption was increased by 30% to produce the same power as before. 2009 also had the introduction of a soft compound tyre at certain events to try to improve the quality of the racing and create different strategies.

In 2005, AVESCO changed its name to V8 Supercars Australia (VESA). The series continued to expand during this time, with races held outside of Australasia for the first time. The series travelled to the Shanghai International Circuit in China in 2005, originally on a five-year agreement, however the promoter of the race dropped their support and the series did not return thereafter. 2006 saw the series travel to the Middle East, with an event held at the Bahrain International Circuit in Bahrain. Multiple new street circuits appeared on the calendar in 2008 and 2009, with new events held in Hamilton in New Zealand, Townsville in North Queensland and at Sydney Olympic Park. The series&#x27; Middle East expansion continued in 2010 with a second round held at the Yas Marina Circuit in Abu Dhabi. In November 2010, the series was granted international status by the FIA for the 2011 season, allowing the series to race at up to six international venues each year. As a result, the series name was changed to the &#x27;International V8 Supercars Championship&#x27;.

2008 saw the separate boards of directors of VESA and TEGA merge into a single board that was solely responsible for the administration of the category. The new board of directors was composed of four TEGA representatives, two members from SEL and two independent directors. In 2011, TEGA and SEL entered a sale agreement with Australian Motor Racing Partners (AMRP), which had significant financial backing from Archer Capital. This agreement saw SEL lose its 25% stake in V8 Supercars, with Archer Capital taking up a 60% share and TEGA the other 40%. A new board of directors was appointed, with two TEGA representatives and two AMRP representatives.

In 2011, Archer Capital purchased a 65% shareholding in the series with the teams owning the other 35%. In December 2021, both Archer Capital and the teams sold their shareholdings to Race Australia Consolidated Enterprises.

====New Generation V8 Supercar====
In the middle of 2008, a project led by Mark Skaife was organised by V8 Supercars to investigate future directions for the sport. The project had the primary objective of cutting costs to $250,000 per car through the use of control parts and to create a pathway for new manufacturers to enter the series, provided that they have a four-door saloon car in mass production. The new formula, called &quot;Car of the Future&quot;, was scheduled to be introduced before or during the 2012 season. The plan was publicly unveiled in March 2010 and was shown to incorporate several key changes to the internal workings of the car. The chassis and the cooling, fuel and electronics systems would all be changed to control parts, with changes to the engine, drivetrain, rear suspension, wheels and the control brake package. The safety of the cars was also to be reviewed and improved. While the plans were well received by all of the teams, Holden Motorsport boss Simon McNamara warned potential new manufacturers to stay out of the championship just hours after the plans were released, claiming that they would &quot;gain nothing&quot; from entering the series.

Major changes were revealed to include a switch from a live rear axle to independent rear suspension; the use of a rear transaxle instead of a mid-mounted gearbox; the repositioning of the fuel tank to in front of the rear axle to improve safety; replacing the windscreen with a polycarbonate unit; and a switch from to wheels. In 2011, it was announced that the Car of the Future would not be introduced until 2013. In February 2012, Nissan confirmed that they would enter the series under Car of the Future regulations with Kelly Racing. Later in 2012, Australian GT Championship team Erebus Motorsport announced they would be running Mercedes-Benz cars in the championship, taking over Stone Brothers Racing. In June 2013, Volvo announced it would enter the series in 2014 in a collaboration with its motorsport arm, Polestar Racing and Garry Rogers Motorsport. In November 2013 the Car of the Future moniker was dropped in favour of the name &quot;New Generation V8 Supercar&quot;.

The series continued its international expansion in 2013, with the first event in North America held at the Circuit of the Americas in Austin, Texas. In 2015, five drivers took part in a series of demonstration races at the Kuala Lumpur Street Circuit as part of the KL City Grand Prix. This was intended to be a precursor to the series holding a championship event at the circuit in 2016, in a push from CEO James Warburton to build series exposure in Asia. The event was later cancelled due to legal issues affecting the circuit.

==== Gen 2 Supercar ====
In December 2014, Supercars released details concerning the future of the category. New regulations, dubbed Gen2 Supercar, were introduced in 2017 to allow the use of two-door coupé body styles and turbocharged four- or six-cylinder engines. However, no teams elected to build cars to these alternate engine specifications. Cars were still required to be based on front-engined, rear-wheel drive, four-seater production cars that were sold in Australia. The chassis and control components were carried over from the New Generation V8 Supercar regulations, while engine and aerodynamic parity was reviewed. Where Holden ZB Commodore made a debut in 2018 and later, Ford Mustang S550 in the 2019 debut as the only Two-door coupe Gen2 specifications and also the successor of FG X Falcon, which been discontinued at the end of 2016.

===Supercars Championship===
In April 2016, the series reached an agreement with Virgin Australia to rename the series to the &quot;Virgin Australia Supercars Championship&quot; on 1 July.

For the 2021 season, this changed to the Repco Supercars Championship on a 5-year deal, extended to an 8-year deal at the end of 2022.

==== Gen 3 Supercar ====
After being first announced in 2020, and after being delayed for a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Gen 3 regulations were introduced for the 2023 Supercars Championship. The main aim was to create closer racing, to reduce costs and to increase road-relevance for the manufacturers. To do this, sweeping aerodynamic changes were made to cut the generated downforce. This reduced the amount of &quot;dirty&quot; air created, and made the cars more challenging to drive. The regulations continued previous changes to ensure technical parity between cars, helping to keep power, downforce and drag levels identical. Engines were also changed, to increase longevity and decrease the cost of a rebuild.

==Supercar specifications==

The current Gen 3 regulations are a complete refresh of the previous generation, with the cessation of volume car production in Australia being a major factor. The current cars are the Ford Mustang GT and the Chevrolet Camaro ZL1.

The full list of regulations, Sporting and Technical, can be found on the Supercars website in the operations manual .

=== Parity ===
Supercars is a &quot;parity formula&quot; which attempts to ensure that competitors using any of the available car models compete on an equal basis. In this aspect, it is similar in philosophy to the NASCAR Cup Series.The category&#x27;s current rules, and the charter between organisers and teams state that &quot;..to the extent that it is possible, Competition will take place between the different makes and models of Cars as equalised by the technical parity mechanisms enshrined in the Rules.&quot;.

However, the rules go on to state that &quot;The Category is not about equalisation of the abilities of participating Drivers and/or Teams (such equalisation could be, and is in some categories, defined as sporting parity). It is up to individual Drivers and/or Teams to Compete to the best of their abilities under the principle of technical parity.&quot;

Parity is intended to extend to aerodynamics, engine performance, and handling characteristics.

In practice, achieving technical parity has proven difficult and contentious, with a number of changes for the 2023 and 2024 season to aerodynamics and engines.

===Bodyshell===
The body of each car is based on its corresponding production car in Right Hand Drive and with homologation requirements. The bodies of both models are aerodynamically balanced through these homologations requirements, along with general balancing upon entering Composite and Exotic materials are generally not permitted. The tail lamps are carried over from the road car, while the windscreen is replaced by a polycarbonate unit. The cars also carry cameras for broadcasting.

The bodies are built around a chassis provided by official accredited builders, including certain race teams. Currently, Triple Eight Race Engineering homologate the Chevrolet Camaro and Dick Johnson Racing homologate the Ford Mustang. The new for 2026 Toyota GR Supra will be homologaged by Walkinshaw Andretti United.

Many safety features are utilised to protect the driver in the event of a crash. The fuel tank is positioned in front of the rear axle to prevent it from being damaged or ruptured in a rear end impact. The driver is seated towards the centre of the car and extra reinforcement is used on the roll cage on the driver&#x27;s side to lessen the risk of injury in a side-on collision. The cars also feature a collapsible steering column and a fire extinguisher system.

===Aerodynamics===
All cars have an aerodynamics package consisting of a front spoiler and splitter,and a rear wing. The aerodynamics package for each manufacturer is homologated after a series of tests which ensure that the different body styles produce near-identical downforce and drag numbers.

By modern racing vehicle standards, Supercars have relatively low amounts of downforce. This is intended to make it easier to follow other cars, and make the handling more similar to road cars. The Gen 3 cars were originally reported to produce about 140 kg of downforce at 200 km/h, similar to a road-registerable Porsche 911 GT3 RS. Revisions in 2024 are stated to produce about 20% more downforce.

===Weight===
The minimum weight of each car is including the driver and excluding the fuel, with a minimum load of 725 kg over the front axle. The minimum weight for the driver is 95 kg and includes the driver dressed in a full racing suit the seat and seat mountings and any ballast needed to meet the minimum weight. Some other components also have a minimum weight, such as the engine and the front uprights

===Engine and drivetrain===
All cars must be front-engine, rear-wheel-drive, and powered by a V8 engine designated by Supercars for use in the respected model of car, and balanced in power and weight. Currently, the GM engine (for use in the Camaro) is a 5.7L V8 with a single camshaft and two valves per cylinder. The Ford engine (for use in the Mustang) is a 5.4L V8 with four camshafts and 4 valves per cylinder. These engines were designed to be cheaper and have a higher longevity compared to previous engines, along with being more road-relevant. The Toyota engine (for use in the GR Supra) introduced in 2026 is a 5.0L V8 with DOHC with 4 valves per cylinder.

As of the Gen3 Supercars, all engines for a given car model are built by a single engine builder - Herrod Performance Engines for the Mustang and KRE Race Engines for the Camaro. Each engine is tested on a dynamometer before delivery to ensure the power and torque characteristics are to specification, and engine allocation is randomised to preclude more powerful engines being allocated to a specific team. Engines are sealed upon delivery, and modifications are prohibited. Engine servicing is only permitted under strict conditions and after minimum distances completed with the engine. Teams are only permitted two new engines per car, per year.

Power is transferred from the engine to the rear wheels through a six-speed sequential transaxle with an integrated spool differential. The individual gear ratios and the final drive ratio are fixed with drop gears at the front of the transaxle allowing the teams to alter the overall transmission ratio for different circuits. The cars use a triple plate clutch. The cars run on E75 fuel with a fuel tank capacity of about 130 Litres

An electronic control unit (ECU), provided by MoTeC, is used to monitor and optimise various aspects of the engine&#x27;s performance. Numerous sensors in the car collect information which is then transmitted to the team, allowing them to monitor things such as tyre wear and fuel consumption and find potential problems with the car. The ECU is also used by officials during the scrutineering process. During the race it can also serve functions such as to automatically limit a car&#x27;s speed.

===Suspension===
All cars are required to use a double wishbone setup for the front suspension and independent rear suspension. Both the front and rear suspension systems feature adjustable shock absorbers and an anti-roll bar which, as of the introduction of the Gen 3 regulations, can not be adjusted from inside the car

===Brakes===
The cars use disc brakes supplied by AP Racing on the front and rear, with the master cylinders provided by AP Racing or former control brake supplier Alcon. The front discs have a diameter of and a six-piston caliper, while the rear discs are diameter and have a four-piston caliper.

===Wheels and tyres===
The cars use control wheels, produced by Rimstock and supplied by Racer Industries, and control tyres from Dunlop. Supercars are provided with Soft, Supersoft, and Hard slick tyres as well as grooved wet tyres for each event, The requirement to use varying compounds and how many tyres need to be changed per race are dependent on the event

=== Performance ===
The highest speed recorded in a Supercar of any generation is 300.5 km/h on the (downhill) Conrod Straight on the Mount Panorama Circuit, by Shane van Gisbergen in qualifying for the 2023 Bathurst 1000. 2024-spec cars are expected to be about 10 km/h slower.

Supercar lap times are similar to the 992 GT3 Cup cars running in the Porsche Carrera Cup Australia Championship. At the 2023 Bathurst 1000, the fastest Supercars qualifying lap recorded was 2:04.664 by Brodie Kostecki. On the same race weekend, the fastest qualifying lap recorded by the Carrera Cup cars was 2:04.6672.

While Gen 3 Supercars and NASCAR Cup Series cars have never raced on the same circuit, their relative performance against Carrera Cup cars gives some indication of how they might compare on the same track. At Circuit of the Americas, the Cup series lap record is more than three seconds per lap slower than Carrera Cup, whereas the Supercars virtually match the Carrera Cup car performance at circuits where they both race. NASCAR Cup Series cars are designed to race on superspeedways and short-track oval courses as well as road circuits. Cam Waters, after driving a Cup series car in preparation for his first NASCAR race, said that the latest-generation NASCAR cars &quot;...feel fairly similar in some ways to the Supercars back home..Fairly heavy, the gearboxes are similar, the brakes are similar, a bit more power &quot;(in the Cup Series car)&quot;&quot;.

Compared to other modern circuit racing vehicles, V8 Supercars are quite powerful, but have relatively little downforce and mechanical grip, making them challenging to drive. The spool differential, which is very uncommon in modern racing vehicles, also requires a specific driving style unique to the series and makes it hard for drivers used to other categories to adapt quickly.

===Cost===
The Gen 3 Supercar regulations were intended to reduce the cost of building a car (without engine) from around $450,000 to $250,000. In practice, this did not occur, with teams reporting that rather than reduced costs, building and running costs increased by approximately 30% from Gen2 to Gen3 as of 2023. The increased costs were partly attributed to time pressures getting the cars ready while dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020-21, and the broader impact on materials costs of that period.

The costs of competing in the championship are considerably higher than the purchase price of a car. There is no budget cap, though caps have been proposed. One estimate puts the season cost for teams at &quot;1.2 to 3 million (Australian) dollars per car&quot; per season.

==Series structure==
===Teams and drivers===
In order to compete in the Supercars Championship, drivers are required to hold a Motorsport Australia Superlicence, earned by success in other high-level Australian circuit racing series (with special eligibility processes for overseas drivers).

Each car entered is required to have a Teams Racing Charter (TRC), formerly known as a Racing Entitlements Contract (REC). A TRC is a contract between Supercars and a team which outlines the team&#x27;s entitlements and obligations. TRCs may be leased by their owners to another party for a maximum of two years, after which the owner must either use it themselves or sell it. A racing number is tied to each TRC, with teams able to apply for a TRC number to be changed. The defending series champion is entitled to use the number 1, with the original TRC number of that car reserved and not able to be used by another team without the agreement of its owner.

The TRCs were originally issued in 1999. Known as TEGA franchise agreements, they were divided into three categories – Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3. Twelve Level 1 franchises were issued to those teams that had competed in the series full-time since its inception in 1997:

A thirteenth was later issued to Bob Forbes Racing. A Level 1 franchise required a team to race at least one car at all events, and at various times allowed a team to enter up to four cars. Other teams received Level 2 and Level 3 franchises based on their level of participation. The structure was changed a number of times before the present system of 28 RECs was arrived at in 2011. Supercars bought a number of RECs as they became available in order to achieve a long-held desire to reduce the field to 28 cars.

At the end of 2013, Lucas Dumbrell Motorsport, Tony D&#x27;Alberto Racing and Triple F Racing each returned a REC to Supercars. These were put up for sale in 2014, but no bids were received. One was reclaimed by Lucas Dumbrell Motorsport in 2015 after a legal fight. At the end of 2014, a further REC was returned by James Rosenberg Racing. In April 2015, Supercars launched a tender for one REC for the 2016 season, with Triple Eight the successful bidder.

Teams consist of one to four cars, with most one-car teams forming a technical alliance with a larger team. Only the REC holders are allowed to compete at each event, although &quot;wildcard&quot; entries are accepted for the endurance races, with a maximum of six extra cars on top of the regular 28. Both Supercars and Development Series teams have entered wildcard entries in previous years. In 2014, the first wildcard entry for a sprint race was issued when Dick Johnson Racing entered a third car for Marcos Ambrose at the Sydney 500.

Most drivers in the series are full-time professionals paid by their teams. Exact salaries are not disclosed, but former team owner Roland Dane stated in 2024 &quot;...the two top Supercar drivers are earning more than all their European based counterparts racing in GT3.&quot;. Pay drivers are not unknown, but reportedly make up a small minority of the Supercar field.

Teams are required to employ a co-driver for each car during the two endurance races due to the increased race distance and the need for driver substitutions during the race. Teams were able to pair their full-time drivers in one car until a rule change in 2010 that required each full-time driver to remain in his own car and be joined by a co-driver not competing full-time in the series. The Drivers Championship title is awarded to the driver who accumulates the most points over the course of the season. If there is a points tie for the series win, the champion will be decided based on the number of races won by each driver (if there is still a tie, it is based on second-place finishes and so on). Teams also compete for the Teams Championship, with the champion team being decided in the same manner as the Drivers Championship. For Teams Championship points scoring purposes, teams with four cars are separated into a pair of two-car teams, while teams with three cars are split into a two-car team and a single-car team. The Teams Championship dictates the pit lane order for the following season.

The defending champion driver has the right to carry the number 1 the following year. However, Shane van Gisbergen and Scott McLaughlin elected to retain their existing numbers in 2017, 2019, 2020, 2022 &amp; 2023.

===Development series===

A second-tier series, the Dunlop Super2 Series, is run as a support category to the main series at certain events. Initially for privateers who did not have the funding of the professional teams in the late 1990s, the series now serves the dual purpose of developing young drivers before they compete in the main series and a means for main series teams to give their endurance co-drivers more racing experience prior to the endurance races. Teams in the Dunlop Super2 Series compete with cars previously used in the main series. From the 2021 Season until the end of the 2024 season the Dunlop Super2 Series would compete as a class alongside the Super3 Series V8 Supercars class racing together on track at the same time. In the year 2025 season the Super3 Series would be axed due to low grid numbers in the 2024 season reverting back to a single class of the Dunlop Series.
A third V8 Supercar-based series, the Kumho Tyres V8 Touring Car Series, had been run since 2008 until the end of 2024, but had no involvement with the Supercars Championship or Dunlop Super2 Series, instead running on the programme of the Shannons Nationals Motor Racing Championships. However, since 2016, several rounds have been run as support categories at Supercars events. It would officially become the third-tier series of V8 Supercars starting in 2019 before the category known as the Super3 Series would join as a class alongside Super2 Series Class V8 Supercars starting in the 2021 season. In the 2023 Season the V8 Touring Car Series would be revived to create an unofficial standalone fourth-tier level V8 Supercars category using V8 Supercars sold to teams that are no longer racing in the Super3 Series of the Dunlop Super2 &amp; Super3 Series, however it would only last for that year&#x27;s season. The Super3 Series would officially be axed in 2025 and become defunct due to low grid numbers with only as many as two or three cars appearing at rounds in the 2024 Dunlop Super2 &amp; Super3 Series season.

== Qualifying ==
In 2023, there are two distinct formats for determining grid positions in races: Format 1 and Format 2. Format 1 uses a single qualifying session where all drivers participate simultaneously to establish their grid positions. Format 2, on the other hand, divides qualifying into three separate sessions. During Q1, the five slowest cars are assigned the last five grid positions, and the faster cars progress to Q2. In Q2, this process is repeated to determine the next ten grid positions. Finally, Q3 decides the top 10 grid positions. This can be done through a standard qualifying session or a &#x27;top-ten shoot-out&#x27;, where each driver has a single opportunity to set their lap time.

The selection between these qualifying formats is influenced by a variety of factors, including the layout of the track, the length of each race, and strategic considerations unique to each event. This approach allows the championship to adapt to a wide range of racing conditions and maintains a dynamic and engaging competition for participants and spectators alike, however, it is not uncommon for both Qualifying Format 1 and Format 2 to be utilised over the course of the same race weekend, especially during events that feature multiple races.

==Race formats==
In 2023, there are three racing formats: SuperSprint, two-race rounds and endurance.

In previous years, formats included SuperSprint events, International SuperSprint events, SuperStreet events and Enduro Cup events.

===SuperSprint===
In 2023, the SuperSprint format will be used for the Melbourne SuperSprint (previously known as the Melbourne 400), the Perth SuperSprint, the Tasmania SuperSprint, the Sydney SuperNight, the Darwin Triple Crown and The Bend SuperSprint.

The format was previously used for the Phillip Island SuperSprint, Winton SuperSprint and the Ipswich SuperSprint.

The SuperSprint format generally involves three (at the Melbourne Supersprint four) races, each with separate qualifying sessions, on the Saturday and the Sunday. Some races use the same qualifying format for each race while other use format 1 and 2 on different days.

In previous years, the Phillip Island and Sydney Motorsport Park events featured a single one-hour practice session on Saturday, while all other SuperSprint events have two one-hour practice sessions on the Friday with a fifteen-minute practice session on Saturday. The Winton and Ipswich events featured an extra thirty-minute session on Friday for endurance co-drivers. The SuperSprint format featured a fifteen-minute qualifying session held on Saturday to decide the grid for the race on the same day. A single twenty-minute session was held on Sunday morning to decide the grid for the Sunday race. The Darwin event also featured a top ten shootout (a session where the fastest ten qualifiers complete one flying lap each to determine the top ten on the grid) following the Sunday qualifying session. A single race was held on Saturday with a single race was held on Sunday.

====International SuperSprint====
The International SuperSprint format was used at the Auckland SuperSprint.

Three thirty-minute practice sessions are held on Friday, while Saturday and Sunday both consist of two ten-minute qualifying sessions which set the grid for the pair of races held on each day.

=== Two-race Weekends ===
The two-race round format, previously known as the SuperStreet format, covers those races not branded as a SuperSprint or an endurance race. In 2023 the format will be used in the Newcastle 500, the Townsville 500, the Gold Coast 500 and the Adelaide 500.

This format generally involves two races on the Saturday and Sunday of the race weekend, 250 km in length. Unlike the SuperSprint, refuelling is allowed.

In previous years, two thirty-minute practice sessions took place on Friday at each SuperStreet event, while a thirty-minute practice session is held on Saturday at Adelaide. The Adelaide event features a fifteen-minute qualifying session on Friday to determine the grid for the Saturday race, while the other events have a single fifteen-minute session on Saturday. All four events feature a twenty-minute session followed by a top ten shootout both on Saturday and Sunday. The Adelaide 500, Newcastle 500, Townsville 500 and Gold Coast 500 feature a single race on each of Saturday and Sunday.

===Endurance races===

In 2023, there are two endurance races, the Bathurst 1000 and the Sandown 500. In previous years, the Gold Coast race was run as an endurance race and the driver who won the most points over the three races was awarded the Enduro Cup.

This format is a single endurance race over either 500 or 1000 km with refuelling allowed and multiple drivers required. The Bathurst race takes around six hours to complete with the Sandown race taking around half that.

In previous years, the Sandown 500 and the Gold Coast 600 both featured three thirty-minute practice sessions held on Friday, with Sandown having an extra session on Saturday. Practice for the Bathurst 1000 consists of six one-hour sessions held across Thursday, Friday and Saturday. Qualifying for the Sandown 500 involves a twenty-minute session followed by a pair of &quot;qualifying races&quot; held on Saturday. The grid for the first race is based on the qualifying session; the grid for the second race is based on the results of the first. The results of the second race determine the grid for the main race on Sunday. Co-drivers must compete in the first of the qualifying races while the main driver must compete in the second. The Bathurst 1000 features a single forty-minute qualifying session on Friday afternoon followed by a top ten shootout on Saturday. The Gold Coast 600 had two twenty-minute qualifying sessions, one each on Saturday and Sunday, with the Sunday session followed by a top ten shootout. The Sandown 500 and Bathurst 1000 both have a twenty-minute warm-up session on Sunday morning.

The Sandown 500 and the Bathurst 1000 feature single races held on Sunday, at and in length respectively. The Gold Coast 600 consisted of two races with one held on Saturday and one on Sunday.

===Points systems===
Between the founding of the championship and the current season, many different points scoring systems have been used. In the first few years, the same basic system as Formula 1 was used. Since the 1980s, separate point systems have been developed, some of which were based on the length of the race or which took into account whether there was only one long-distance race or several short races in a championship round. This should give the races a better weighting.

==== 2008–2024 ====
Points are awarded as follows at all championship events. Various different points scales are applied to events having one, two, three or four races, ensuring that a driver will be awarded 300 points for winning all races at any event. Points are awarded to all cars that have covered 75% of the race distance, provided they are running at the completion of the final lap and with a final lap time within 200% of the race winner&#x27;s fastest lap. At the endurance events, both drivers earn the total points awarded to the finishing position of the car.

==Notable events==
===Bathurst 1000===
The Bathurst 1000, also known as the &quot;Great Race&quot; and held in some form since 1960, is the most famous race on the Supercars calendar, as well as the longest both in terms of race distance and race time. The race is run over 161 laps of the Mount Panorama Circuit, in total, taking between six and seven hours to complete. The event has historically attracted crowds of nearly 200,000 people. The Peter Brock Trophy, named after nine-time Bathurst 1000 winner Peter Brock, is awarded to the winners of the race. The trophy was introduced in 2006 following Brock&#x27;s death in a crash at the Targa West rally one month prior to the race.

===Adelaide 500===
The Adelaide 500, also known as the &quot;Clipsal 500&quot; and &quot;Superloop 500&quot; under former sponsorship names, is the premier car race in South Australia. It is the largest V8 Supercars race in the country by crowd numbers. Beginning in 1999, the race is held in the eastern streets of the Adelaide CBD, on a reduced version of the Adelaide Street Circuit previously used by the Grand Prix. There was no race in 2021 after the contract was not renewed by Liberal premier Steven Marshall, before it was revived in 2022 with a new contract under by subsequent Labor premier Peter Malinauskas, who had pledged its return during the 2022 South Australian state election. Held over four days, the event consists of two 250 kilometre races for the V8 Supercars, and additionary practise and qualifying races. The event has several categories of races throughout the four days, including Super2 Series, Formula 5000, SuperUtes Series, Touring Car Masters, Australian GT, and the Australian Carrera Cup as well as others. The race is accompanied by live music performances, of which the likes of Kiss, Keith Urban and Robbie Williams have previously performed, as well as food, activities, and an RAAF F/A 18A Hornet display each day in the skies above the city.

===Sandown 500===
The Sandown 500 was first held as a six-hour race in 1964 and has been labelled as the traditional &quot;Bathurst warm-up&quot; race. Like the Bathurst 1000, the Sandown 500 is run over 161 laps. Due to the shorter track length of Sandown Raceway, the race is only and runs for between three and four hours. The Sandown 500 was not held for Supercars from 1999 to 2002 and from 2008 to 2011. During these years, the endurance races took place at Queensland Raceway (1999–2002) and the Phillip Island Grand Prix Circuit (2008–2011).

==Media coverage==
===Television===
The series is currently broadcast on Fox Sports and the Seven Network. Fox Sports shows all practice and qualifying sessions live along with the races. Seven shows only seven events live which are Adelaide, Melbourne, Townsville, Sandown, Bathurst, Gold Coast and Newcastle with the rest shown as a highlights package after the races have finished. The coverage is produced by Supercars Media, a specialist production company for Supercars Australia. Supercars Media provides the commentary for each race, with former champion and Bathurst winner Mark Skaife as lead commentator, along with Neil Crompton as expert commentator. Both Fox Sports and Seven use their own commentary team for pre- and post-race coverage. Supercars Media records the series in 1080i high-definition, with many cars carrying four or more onboard-cameras, though HD coverage is available only to subscribers of Foxtel HD.

Prior to the 1983 Australian Touring Car Champion season, the series did not have a common TV home, splitting between ABC and Channel 7, as the track owners controlled the TV rights for their specific round.

in 1983, CAMS intervened and prevented the track owners from obtaining their own TV rights and instead negotiated a contract with the ABC. The only race that was not shown in 1983 &amp; 1984 on the ABC was the Calder round, as Channel 7 already had a long term deal with Calder Park until 1984. 

In 1985, the coverage moved full time to Channel 7. Due to reasons unknown, the first round was missed in certain regions and was shown as highlights at the second round. This was how it was until 1996 except for events were the ATCC was a support act (Australian GP F1 - Channel 9 and Indy Cars - Channel 9 / 10 on the Gold Coast) or non championship race (ie: ATCC Endurance Championship - Sandown 400/500 - ABC). Most races were same day delayed coverage to avoid the emptiness between ATCC and support races.

In 1996, the season was brought forward and the time between events was shortened to avoid conflicting with that years Olympic Games in Atlanta (Channel 7 being the rights holder for the Olympics). 

Meaning final round was in June instead of its traditional slot of August / September.

Due to the Olympics, Channel 10 broadcast the Sandown 500 for 1996. 

The Bathurst 500 / 1000 was shown exclusively on Channel 7 from 1963 until 1996, and then from 1997 was packaged as part of the AVESCO TV Contract. 

The V8 Supercars were broadcast on Network Ten and Fox Sports from 1997 as part of the AVESCO TV Contract.

In 2000, select races (FAI 1000) were produced and broadcast in widescreen (16:9). However, the public was not able to see this feed until it was rebroadcast on Foxtel on their Bathurst channel and when it was released to DVD in the 2020s. 

In 2001, as Digital TV arrived in Australia, every race was produced and broadcast in native widescreen (16:9) on Channel 10 Digital.

For analogue TV viewers, they received a letterbox feed (excluding Round 1, which provided analogue viewers with their own feed, which was too demanding, so opted for a letterbox simulcast instead from Round 2 on-wards), while international and Fox Sports users were shown a 4:3 feed. For every Split screen (ie: going for an interview, showing pit stops, pit reporters, going onboard, etc while showing track cameras), the feeds shown were within the 4:3 frame but were in their native 16:9 widescreen format, giving analogue and international viewers a glimpse of what they were missing out on.

For 2001 Clipsal 500 and Bathurst 1000, an interactive feed was available, with the following being broadcast at the 2001 Clipsal 500:

* Digital 1 - Normal Ten Telecast (simulcast) 
* Digital 2 - Multiview Channel (Bill McDonald hosting, views in cars, iso cameras, pit interviews, aerials etc)
* Digital 3 - Leaderboards

And the following were broadcast at the 2001 Bathurst 1000:

* Digital 1 - Main telecast in 16:9 widescreen (simulcast) 
* Digital 2 - Alternate race view (onboards, helicopter camera, behind the leaders, leader cam (when other battles were being shown on Digital 1)
* Digital 3 - Top of the mountain camera 
* Digital 4 - Leader board 

Due to low viewership, this was never repeated after season 2001. 

From 2002, the V8 Supercars Greatest Hits Volume 2 (to Volume 4) DVDs and from the 2003 season, the V8 Supercars and Bathurst 1000 highlight DVDs, produced by Sony TV, were released in native widescreen (16:9). 

At the 2002 Bathurst 1000, a ticker was used to show live positions. It was moved from beside the lap counter to the bottom of the screen in 2003.

In 2003, Bigpond became the exclusive Streaming provider for Bigpond Broadband Customers only. 

This included live practice, qualifying and top ten shootouts, ad free racing as well as live onboard and telemetry from your selected driver. 

This ended in 2007 when Channel 7 became the tv rights holder. 

In 2004, Foxtel Digital was launched and by 2005 was showing races in widescreen.

At the Bathurst 1000 in 2004, Sky Cam, which hovered above the pit lane, was introduced. The camera ran on a wire from the Pedestrian Overpass to Turn 1 and had 360 degree tilt and pan. 

The camera would be used in other events after its successful run at Bathurst. 

This initial contract with Channel 10 and Fox Sports ended at the conclusion of the 2006 season. 

Channel 7 regained the rights from 2007 to 2014. 

While Chanel 7 had the rights, Network Ten and Fox Sports continued to broadcast the series once a year for the Melbourne 400 championship races, which are a support category at the Formula One Rolex Australian Grand Prix, which was broadcast by Ten and Fox Sports. All support category races were tied up with the Formula One Australian Grand Prix broadcast rights as a package.

Then the rights were returned to Network Ten and Fox Sports from 2015 to 2020. 

In 2020, Seven Network and Foxtel signed a five-year deal worth $200 million to televise the Repco Supercars Championship from 2021 to 2025. Seven Network will broadcast six rounds live and show highlights for other races it is not able to broadcast. Foxtel&#x27;s deal remains the same, it will show all races live and ad free on Fox Sports.

Ten&#x27;s television series &quot;RPM&quot;, which has aired from 1997 to 2008, in 2011 and from 2015 onwards, has covered Supercars, alongside other motorsports. From 2007 to 2014, Seven broadcast a weekly 25-minute show titled &quot;V8Xtra&quot; on non-racing weekends. The dedicated Supercars program covered news and feature items relating to the series. Since 2015, Fox Sports has broadcast a similar show, &quot;Inside Supercars&quot;, a weekly one-hour long program featuring a panel led by Rust and Mark Skaife. In the same year, Fox Sports also launched an observational show &quot;Supercars Life&quot;, featuring behind the scenes footage from race weekends and features on drivers&#x27; lives away from the track. In 2018, &quot;Inside Supercars&quot; was superseded by a new show on Fox Sports, &quot;Supercars Trackside&quot;. Instead of being filmed in a studio midweek, the show is filmed on the Thursday before and the Sunday after each race meeting at the circuit.

The television broadcast of the Bathurst 1000 has won a Logie Award for the Most Outstanding Sports Coverage seven times (Note: year won is for the prior years coverage and are shown in Bold): 1979, 1985, 1998 (nominated), 2000, 2001 (nominated), 2002 (nominated), 2006, 2007 (nominated), 2008, 2009 (nominated), 2010, 2012 (nominated), 2015 (nominated), 2017 (nominated), and most recently won in 2018 for the 2017 Bathurst 1000. 

Foxtel broadcast the 2018 Bathurst 1000 in 4K resolution, the first such broadcast in Australian sport.

====Current TV broadcasters====
Supercars races are broadcast on the following channels:
===Other media===

The series has its own live streaming pay-per-view service, Superview. The service, which started in 2013, currently shows all races as well as qualifying sessions. In 2021 the service was brought to YouTube which shows complete broadcasts including support races. The service is not available in New Zealand and Australia due to their current broadcasting rights with Sky Sport and Fox Sports.

The series has its own website, which contains information about the series, drivers, teams and events and news articles, and a radio show, V8 Insiders. News is also featured on motorsport websites such as Speedcafe and V8Sleuth. A media deal with News Corp Australia has been in place since 2009.

===Video games===

Supercars have made several licensed appearances in video games, including in Codemasters&#x27; &quot;V8 Supercars&quot; series in the 2000s and Turn 10 Studios&#x27; &quot;Forza&quot; series in the 2010s. From 2011 to 2014, an online championship, sanctioned by Supercars, was contested on iRacing. In 2017, Supercars launched an eSports competition using &quot;Forza Motorsport 6&quot; and &quot;Forza Motorsport 7&quot;, which expanded to six rounds in 2018. The Supercars Eseries moved to the iRacing platform in 2019 with championship teams including Triple Eight Race Engineering and Walkinshaw Andretti United entering teams into the series alongside eSports teams. An additional Eseries was held in mid 2020 with all championship drivers competing during the hiatus caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

<text>Cortland County is a county located in the U.S. state of New York. As of the 2020 census, the population of Cortland County was 46,809. The county seat is Cortland. The county is named after Pierre Van Cortlandt, president of the convention at Kingston that wrote the first New York State Constitution in 1777, and first lieutenant governor of the state. The county is part of the Central New York region of the state.

Cortland County comprises the Cortland, NY Micropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Ithaca–Cortland, NY Combined Statistical Area.

The Cortland apple is named for the county.

==History==

===Early history===
Located in the glaciated Appalachian Plateau area of Central New York, midway between Syracuse and Binghamton, this predominantly rural county is the southeastern gateway to the Finger Lakes Region. Scattered archaeological evidence indicates the Iroquois also known as the Haudenosaunee controlled the area beginning about AD 1500.

What was to become Cortland County remained within Indian territory until the American Revolution. It became part of the Military Tract, when, in 1781, more than 1¼ million acres (5,100 km2) were set aside by the State&#x27;s Legislature to compensate two regiments formed to protect the State&#x27;s western section from the English and their Iroquois allies, at the close of the Revolution. To encourage settlement in the upstate isolated wilderness, the State constructed a road from Oxford through Cortland County to Cayuga Lake in 1792–94. This, and construction of privately financed roads, were the major impetus to settlement.

When counties were established in New York in 1683, the present Cortland County was part of Albany County, which encompassed the northern part of New York and all of the present State of Vermont, as well as indeterminate territory to west. On March 12, 1772, present day Cortland County became part of Tryon County, named for William Tryon, colonial governor of New York. In 1784, following the peace treaty that ended the American Revolutionary War, the name of the county was changed to honor General Richard Montgomery, who had captured several places in Canada and died attempting to capture the city of Quebec, thus replacing the name of the locally unpopular British governor. Present day Cortland County became part of Herkimer County in 1791, then became a part of Onondaga County when it split from Herkimer in 1794. Cortland County was formed by the splitting of Onondaga County in 1808.

===Settlement of the county===
Eastern New Yorkers and New Englanders, wanting new land to farm, welcomed the opening of this frontier. The first white settlement in the county was made in 1791 by Amos Todd, Joseph Beebe and Rhoda Todd Beebe, emigrants from Connecticut who paddled up the Tioughnioga River from Windsor, to live near the head of navigation in the Town of Homer. Following them came a flood of settlers who, in 1808, petitioned the State Legislature for county status. Thus, Cortland County was created from the southern half of Onondaga County as part of the Boston Ten Towns on April 8, 1808, and was named in honor of the Pierre Van Cortlandt family - Pierre, Sr. having been the first lieutenant governor of the state.

===Nineteenth century===

The 76th New York Volunteer Infantry was one of the most famous of the New York units in the Civil War. It was raised in 1861 primarily from Cortland County and the surrounding areas (about a third of the men were from the Cherry Valley area). The 76th was in most of the major battles the Army of the Potomac fought from Second Bull Run through Petersburg, at which time the three-year enlistment of most of the men ran out and the 300 or so men remaining from the 1,100 who left Cortland either returned home or transferred to other units.

At the Battle of Gettysburg, the 76th New York was one of the first infantry regiments on the field, holding down the extreme right of the Union line on the first day. The regiment took huge casualties in that battle - nearly one-third of its strength - including its commander Major Andrew J. Grover, the first infantry officer killed in the battle.

===Modern Cortland County===
Today, Cortland county is noted for the production of CNC milling machines, hospitality supplies, medical instruments and components, textiles, electronic components, plastic consumer goods, components for NASA, and a variety of other goods and services. International exporting is an integral part of many of the corporations in the area.

The county&#x27;s present reflects its past. Agribusiness flourishes, yet consistent with the pattern elsewhere in New York State, the number of farms has declined while farm size and yield have increased. Continued growth in the service and light industry sectors is contributing to the growing strength of the Central New York region and the Southern Tier region.

The loss of many of its local businesses has led to the current economic decline of the region. Cornell University, Syracuse University, Binghamton University, and Ithaca College are all within a 45-minute drive of the City of Cortland. The State University of New York College at Cortland and Tompkins Cortland Community College are located in the county.

==Government and politics==












|}

Cortland County is a bellwether county, having voted for the national winner in every presidential election from 1980 to 2016. The city of Cortland itself, the largest city in the county, leans Democratic.

Republican Ronald Reagan scored landslide wins in the county in 1980 and 1984. Democrat Bill Clinton carried the county with pluralities in 1992 and 1996. Republican George W. Bush carried the county in 2000 and 2004, defeating Al Gore by less than 1% in 2000, and John Kerry by just over 4% in 2004. In 2008, Barack Obama defeated John McCain 54-44%, and in 2012 he defeated Mitt Romney by a similar margin. The last Democrat to win a majority in Cortland County prior to Obama was Lyndon Johnson in 1964.

In 2020, Cortland County&#x27;s streak of voting for the winner ended, as Joe Biden defeated Republican incumbent Donald Trump. Had the streak continued, it would have been tied with Clallam County, Washington for the longest active streak in the nation, as the streaks of longstanding bellwethers Valencia County, New Mexico and Vigo County, Indiana also ended in 2020. Cortland was one of five counties in the state that Trump carried by less than 500 votes.

Cortland County&#x27;s lawmaking body is the legislature, which consists of 17 members. All are elected from single member districts.

<doc id="54165" wikidata="Q115200" url="?curid=54165" title="Columbia County, New York">
<text>Columbia County is a county in the U.S. state of New York. At the 2020 census, the population was 61,570. The county seat is Hudson. The name comes from the Latin feminine form of the surname of Christopher Columbus, which was at the time of the formation of the county a popular proposal for the name of the United States. The county is the southern end of the Capital District of the state.

==History==
At the arrival of European colonists the area was inhabited by the indigenous Mohican Indians. To the west of the river were the Mohawk and other four tribes of the Iroquois Confederacy, extending past what is now the border of New York state. The first known European exploration of Columbia County was in 1609, when Henry Hudson, an English explorer sailing for the Dutch, ventured up the Hudson River. An accident to his craft forced him to stop at what is now known as Columbia County and there search for food and supplies. In 1612, the Dutch established trading posts and minor settlements, building New Amsterdam (now New York City) and Fort Orange (now Albany). Fort Orange became a center of the fur trade with the Mohawk people. Traders stopped at points along the Hudson River on their travels between New Amsterdam and Fort Orange; small settlements arose along the river to supply the traders&#x27; ships.

Dutch colonists bought land [from whom?] near Claverack in 1649 and 1667. As more Dutch arrived, the region slowly developed. In 1664, the English took over New Netherland and renamed it the &quot;Province of New York&quot;; they also renamed Fort Orange &quot;Albany&quot;.

In the late 17th century, Robert Livingston, a Scots immigrant by way of Rotterdam, built on his connections as Indian agent in the colony and purchased two large tracts from the Native Americans. He gained much larger grants from the provincial government, for a total of 160,240 acres. He was made lord of Livingston Manor by the Crown, with all its perquisites, and developed the property with tenant farmers. In 1710, he sold 6,000 acres of his property to Queen Anne of Great Britain for use as work camps and for the resettlement of Palatine German refugees. The Crown had supported their passage to New York, and they were to pay off the cost by indentured labor. Some 1,200 Palatine Germans were brought to Livingston Manor (now Germantown). New York&#x27;s Governor Hunter had also helped with these arrangements: the workers were to make naval stores (&quot;e.g.&quot;, pitch, resin, and turpentine) from the pine trees in the Catskill Mountains.

They were promised land for resettlement after completing their terms of indenture. They were refugees from years of religious fighting along the border with France, as well as crop failures from a severe winter. Work camps were established on both sides of the Hudson River. The Germans quickly established Protestant churches at the heart of their community, which recorded their weddings, births and deaths, among the first vital records kept in the colony.

After many years, some of the colonists were granted land in the frontier of the central Mohawk Valley west of present-day Little Falls in the 100 lots of the Burnetsfield Patent; in the Schoharie Valley, and other areas, such as Palatine Bridge along the Mohawk River west of Schenectady. They were buffer communities between the British settlements and the Iroquois and French (the latter located mostly in Canada.)

Columbia County was formed in 1786 after the American Revolutionary War from portions of Albany County, once a vast area until new communities were developed and jurisdictions were organized. In 1799, the southern boundary of Columbia County was moved southward to include that portion of Livingston Manor located in Dutchess County.

In the nineteenth century, the Vermont Central Railway was constructed to the area. It provided transportation north towards Rutland and Burlington, Vermont, and south towards the major junction town of Chatham, New York, for travel to points west, south and east.

A large number of LGBT artists and writers settled in Columbia County in the late 20th century, including Ellsworth Kelly, who moved to the county in 1970, followed by James Ivory and Ismail Merchant (1975) and the poet John Ashbery (1978).

==Government and politics==












|}

Voters in Columbia County since the mid-19th century have mostly elected Republicans to office. But from 1996 to 2007, new voter registrations by Democrats have outpaced those by Republicans by a margin of 4 to 1. Democrats have been able to win the county in every presidential election since 1996, with Joe Biden&#x27;s 57% of the vote in 2020 being the highest for a Democrat in the county since 1964. 

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (2.1%) is water.

Columbia County is in the southeast south-to-central part of New York State, southeast of Albany and immediately west of the Massachusetts border. The western border is the Hudson River.

The landscapes of the county were among the scenes depicting by the Hudson River School, a mid-19th century art movement.

The terrain is gentle, rolling hills, rising sharply into the Taconic and Berkshire Mountains along the state line. To the west lie the Hudson River and the Catskill Mountains.
The highest point is on the Massachusetts state line, near the summit of Alander Mountain, at approximately above sea level, in the town of Copake. The lowest point is at or near sea level, along the Hudson.

Columbia County is accessible by two limited-access highways. The Taconic State Parkway, which is not accessible to trucks or commercial traffic, runs through the center of the county from south to north, ending at an interchange with Interstate 90 and connecting the county with points south. Columbia County is the last New York county located along eastbound Interstate 90 (and the first county along westbound I-90), which passes through the towns of Canaan and Chatham as the Berkshire Connector portion of the New York Thruway. I-90 has two exits within the county; for the southbound Taconic State Parkway in Chatham, and for NYS Route 22 in Canaan. Depending on precise location within the county, road travel distance to New York City ranges between .

Several other major routes cross Columbia County including north–south U.S. Route 9, east–west NYS Route 23, north–south NYS Route 22 and a short portion of east–west U.S. Route 20 in the county&#x27;s northeastern corner.

===Rivers and streams===

The Hudson River forms the western border of the county. Other notable creeks include; the Ancram Creek, Claverack Creek, Copake Creek, Kinderhook Creek, Roeliff-Jansen Kill, and Valatie Kill. The Rossman Falls and Stuyvesant Falls lie on the Kinderhook Creek. Notable lakes and ponds include Copake Lake, Kinderhook Reservoir, Queechy Lake, and Lake Taghkanic.
=== Farms ===
Columbia County is home to many local farms supplying the area with fresh meat, eggs, herbs, and produce, including Holmquest, Ronnybrook, Fix Brothers Fruit Farm, Eger Brothers, Hover Farms, Marsh Meadow Farm, Schober Farm, Millerhurst, Ooms Farm, Churchtown Dairy, Pigasso, Common Hands Farm, Darlin&#x27; Doe, Blue Star Farm, Green Mead Farm, Little Ghent Farm, and Ironwood Farm. Other farms include the large, well-known Hawthorne Valley Farm which includes a farm store and training programs, the biodynamic Roxbury Farm, and FarmOn! at Empire Farm, also a teaching farm.

<text>Raiders of the Lost Ark is a 1981 American action-adventure film directed by Steven Spielberg from a screenplay by Lawrence Kasdan, based on a story by George Lucas and Philip Kaufman. Set in 1936, the film stars Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones, a globetrotting archaeologist vying with Nazi German forces to recover the long-lost Ark of the Covenant which is said to make an army invincible. Teaming up with his tough former romantic interest Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen), Jones races to stop rival archaeologist René Belloq (Paul Freeman) from guiding the Nazis to the Ark and its power.

Lucas conceived &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; in the early 1970s. Seeking to modernize the serial films of the early 20th century, he developed the idea further with Kaufman, who suggested the Ark as the film&#x27;s goal. Lucas eventually focused on developing his 1977 film &quot;Star Wars&quot;. Development on &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; resumed that year when he shared the idea with Spielberg, who joined the project several months later. While the pair had ideas for set pieces and stunts for the film, they hired Kasdan to fill in the narrative gaps between them. Principal photography began in June 1980 on a $20million budget, and concluded that September. Filming took place on sets at Elstree Studios, England, and on location mainly in La Rochelle, France, Tunisia, and Hawaii.

Pre-release polling showed little audience interest in the film leading up to its June 12, 1981 release date, especially compared to &quot;Superman II&quot;. However, &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; became the highest-grossing film of the year, earning approximately $354million worldwide, and played in some theaters for over a year. It was also a critical success, receiving praise for its set pieces, humor, and action sequences. The film was nominated for several awards, and won five Academy Awards, seven Saturn Awards, and one BAFTA, among other accolades.

&quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; is considered by critics to be one of the greatest films ever made and has had a lasting influence on popular culture, spawning a host of imitators across several media and inspiring other filmmakers. The United States Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry in 1999. &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; is the first entry in what became the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; franchise, which includes four more films—&quot;Temple of Doom&quot; (1984), &quot;Last Crusade&quot; (1989), &quot;Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot; (2008), and &quot;Dial of Destiny&quot; (2023)—a television series, video games, comic books, novels, theme park attractions, and toys.

== Plot ==

In 1936, American archaeologist Indiana Jones recovers a Golden Idol from a booby-trapped Peruvian temple. Rival archaeologist René Belloq corners him and steals the idol; Jones escapes in a waiting float plane. After returning to the United States, Jones is briefed by two Army Intelligence agents that Nazi German forces are excavating at Tanis, Egypt, and one of their telegrams mentions Jones&#x27; former mentor Abner Ravenwood. Jones deduces that the Nazis are seeking the Ark of the Covenant, which Adolf Hitler believes will make their army invincible. The agents recruit Jones to recover the Ark first.

At a bar in Nepal, Jones reunites with Abner&#x27;s daughter Marion, with whom Jones once had an illicit relationship, and learns that Abner is dead. The bar is set ablaze during a scuffle with Gestapo agent Arnold Toht, who arrives to take a medallion from Marion. Toht attempts to recover the medallion from the flames, but only burns its image into his hand. Jones and Marion safely take the medallion and escape.

Traveling to Cairo, the pair meet Jones&#x27;s friend Sallah. Sallah reveals Belloq is assisting the Nazis, who have fashioned an incomplete replica medallion from the burns on Toht&#x27;s hand. Nazi soldiers and mercenaries attack Jones, and Marion is seemingly killed, leaving Jones despondent. An imam deciphers the medallion for Jones, revealing that one side bears a warning against disturbing the Ark, and the other bears the complete measurements for the &quot;staff of Ra&quot;, an item used to locate the Ark. Jones and Sallah realize that the Nazis are digging in the wrong location, infiltrate the Nazi dig site, and use the medallion and the correctly sized staff of Ra to locate the Well of Souls, the Ark&#x27;s resting place. They recover the Ark, a golden, intricately decorated chest, but Belloq and the Nazis discover them and seize it. Jones and Marion, whom Belloq has held captive, are sealed inside the well, but the pair escape and Jones captures a truck carrying the Ark. Alongside Marion, Jones arranges to transport the Ark to London aboard a tramp steamer. A German U-boat intercepts the steamer and seizes the Ark and Marion; Jones covertly boards the U-boat. The vessel travels to an island in the Aegean Sea, where Belloq intends to test the power of the Ark before presenting it to Hitler.

On the island, Jones ambushes the Nazi group and threatens to destroy the Ark but surrenders after Belloq deduces that Jones would never destroy something so historically significant, also surmising that Jones wants to know if the Ark&#x27;s power is real. The Nazis restrain Jones and Marion at the testing site as Belloq ceremonially opens the Ark but finds only sand inside. At Jones&#x27; instruction, he and Marion close their eyes to avoid looking at the opened Ark, as it releases spirits, flames, and bolts of energy that kill Belloq, Toht, and the assembled Nazis before sealing itself shut. Jones and Marion open their eyes to find the area cleared of bodies and their bindings removed.

Back in Washington, D.C., the United States government rewards Jones for securing the Ark. Despite Jones&#x27; insistence, the agents state only that the Ark has been moved to an undisclosed location for &quot;top men&quot; to study. In a vast warehouse, the Ark is crated up and stored among countless other crates.

== Production ==
=== Conception ===
George Lucas conceived &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; in 1973, shortly after finishing the comedy drama &quot;American Graffiti&quot; (1973). An old movie poster of a heroic character leaping from a horse to a truck reminded Lucas of the early 20th-century serial films he enjoyed as a youth, such as &quot;Buck Rogers&quot; (1939), &quot;Zorro&#x27;s Fighting Legion&quot; (1939), &quot;Spy Smasher&quot; (1942), and &quot;Don Winslow of the Navy&quot; (1942). He wanted to make a B movie modeled on those serials and conceived &quot;The Adventures of Indiana Smith&quot;, featuring a daring archaeologist named after his Alaskan Malamute dog. Around the same time, Lucas was trying to adapt the space opera serial &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; (1936), but could not obtain the rights. He shelved the Indiana Smith project to focus on creating his own space opera, &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977).

In 1975, Lucas discussed his serial film idea with his friend Philip Kaufman. The pair worked on a story for two weeks. Lucas imagined his character as a college professor and archaeologist adventurer, based on his own appreciation for archaeology and famous archaeologists like Hiram Bingham III, Roy Chapman Andrews, and Leonard Woolley. Kaufman removed Lucas&#x27; vision of Smith as a nightclub patron and womanizer, and suggested the Ark of the Covenant as the film&#x27;s central goal; he learned of the Ark from his hematologist. The Ark provided a source of conflict for the hero and the Nazis, playing off Nazi leader Adolf Hitler&#x27;s historical fascination with the occult.

Lucas wanted Kaufman to direct the film, but because he was already committed to working on the western &quot;The Outlaw Josey Wales&quot; (1976), Lucas paused the idea again and resumed working on &quot;Star Wars&quot;. In May 1977, Lucas vacationed in Hawaii to avoid any potential negative news about the theatrical debut of &quot;Star Wars&quot;, which he feared would fail at the box office. He invited Steven Spielberg to join him and his wife. On a beach near the Mauna Kea Beach Hotel, Lucas and Spielberg discussed their next projects. Spielberg wanted to direct a James Bond film, but Lucas pitched him &quot;The Adventures of Indiana Smith&quot;. Lucas still hoped Kaufman would direct it, but a few months later it was clear he could not participate and Lucas asked Spielberg to replace him.
=== Writing ===
Lawrence Kasdan, Spielberg&#x27;s recent discovery, was chosen to write the script. Kasdan had been working as a professional screenwriter for only a month but Lucas agreed to hire him after reading his script for &quot;Continental Divide&quot; (1981). In January 1978, Lucas, Kasdan, and Spielberg spent about nine hours a day over three to five days at Lucas&#x27; assistant&#x27;s house in Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, developing Lucas&#x27; outline. Several ideas came from these discussions, including the boulder trap, the monkey in Cairo, Toht burning the medallion&#x27;s imprint into his hand, and government agents locking the Ark away. Kasdan realized Spielberg and Lucas had several set pieces in mind, but they were looking for someone else to do the hard work of piecing them together.

Spielberg hated the name Indiana Smith, believing it would remind audiences of the Steve McQueen character Nevada Smith. All three men agreed to use the surname &quot;Jones&quot; instead. The Indiana Jones character was based on actors Clint Eastwood and Toshiro Mifune, and the fictional character James Bond. Lucas also wanted Jones to be a kung fu practitioner and a playboy, funding his lifestyle with the spoils of his adventures, but Spielberg and Kasdan felt the character was complicated enough being an adventurer and archaeologist. Spielberg suggested making Jones an avid gambler or an alcoholic, but Lucas wanted Jones to be a role model who is &quot;honest and true and trusting.&quot; Both men felt it was important Jones be fallible, vulnerable, and as capable of comedic moments as well as serious ones. They intended him to be someone the audience could relate to and idolize. Lucas suggested Marion would have a romantic past, at the age of 11, with the much older Jones; Spielberg replied, &quot;she had better be older&quot;.

While Spielberg directed &quot;1941&quot; (1979), Kasdan used his office to write &quot;Raiders&quot;, taking inspiration from early 20th-century serials and adventure films like &quot;Red River&quot; (1948), &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; (1954), and &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; (1960). He wrote Jones as an antihero, an archaeologist reduced to grave-robbing. Kasdan wanted a supporting cast with their own unique characteristics and believed it was important these characters had a memorable impact. He described how the hardest part of writing was explaining how Jones would fall into successive dangerous events and survive, and how he traveled between locations. In August 1978, after approximately five months, Kasdan completed his first draft.

Spielberg described the draft as good but too long; Kasdan and Lucas collaborated to trim and refine it. The script was a globe-spanning tale set in the United States, Egypt, Greece, and Nepal. Several elements were cut, including a journey to Shanghai that would lead to a minecart chase and Jones using a gong to shield himself from gunfire, ideas later used in the prequel &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot; (1984). To his frustration, much of Kasdan&#x27;s love story between Jones and Marion was trimmed, as were scenes showing the mutual attraction between Marion and Belloq. The screenplay was completed by December 1979.

===Development and pre-production===
Lucas wanted to fund &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; himself, but lacked the money. Lucasfilm offered the project to several Hollywood studios. They rejected it, in part because of the proposed $20million budget, but also because of the deal Lucas offered. He wanted the studio to provide the budget, have no creative input and allow him to retain control of the licensing rights and any sequels. The studios considered this deal unacceptable. They were also hesitant because Spielberg had delivered a succession of films over-schedule and over-budget; his recent effort, &quot;1941&quot;, was both over-budget and a critical failure. However, Lucas refused to do the project without Spielberg.

When the project was offered to Paramount Pictures, president Michael Eisner compromised with Lucas, accepting his deal in exchange for exclusive rights to any sequels and severe penalties for exceeding the schedule or budget. Lucas reportedly negotiated a salary between $1million and $4million plus a share of the gross profits, though a separate report stated he received only net profits. Spielberg received up to $1.5million as director and a share of the gross profits.

Producer Frank Marshall, who had experience on smaller independent films, was hired because Spielberg believed he would keep the film on schedule and budget. Spielberg also hired cinematographer Douglas Slocombe and production designer Norman Reynolds because he liked their previous works, and his long-time collaborator Michael Kahn as editor. Lucas served as a second unit director and the film&#x27;s executive producer, along with his acquaintance Howard Kazanjian, whom Lucas believed would be a disciplined influence and not indulge the filmmakers&#x27; larger ambitions. He also brought in his long-time collaborator Robert Watts as associate producer and production manager. Paramount mandated a filming schedule of 85 days; Lucas, Spielberg, and Marshall agreed on a self-imposed 73-day schedule. Spielberg was determined to avoid criticism for another schedule overrun.

Six months of pre-production began in December 1979. Spielberg preferred to spend a year in pre-production, but worked at a faster pace to keep the budget low. Spielberg and Lucas were both simultaneously working on other projects. Artists Ed Verreaux, Dave Negron, Michael Lloyd, and Joe Johnston provided extensive storyboarding, with over 80% of the script represented, equaling approximately 6,000 images. This helped Spielberg pre-visualize scenes and limit the time taken to set up shots. The script described the opening of the ark only as &quot;all hell breaks loose&quot;, and the artists were tasked with envisioning what should happen. Each offered different aspects: spirits, flames, and weird light effects; Johnston was tasked with combining all three. Spielberg also had miniature sets of larger scenes built to plan layouts and lighting, including the Well of Souls, the Tanis dig site, and the Cairo marketplace. They contained 1-inch tall figurines to suggest how many extras would be required. Among changes made at this stage, Spielberg abandoned his idea for Toht to have a mechanical arm that could be replaced with a machine gun or flamethrower. Lucas said it put the film into a different genre.
===Casting===

Lucas wanted a relatively unknown actor, willing to commit to a trilogy of films, to play Indiana Jones. Those considered for the role included Bill Murray, Nick Nolte, Steve Martin, Chevy Chase, Tim Matheson, Nick Mancuso, Peter Coyote, Jack Nicholson, Jeff Bridges, John Shea, Sam Elliott, Harry Hamlin, and David Hasselhoff. Casting director Mike Fenton favored Bridges but Lucas&#x27; wife and frequent collaborator Marcia Lucas preferred Tom Selleck. Selleck was contractually obligated to filming the television series &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot; if it were to be made into a full series. Lucas and Spielberg asked the show&#x27;s network, CBS, to release him ten days early from his contract. Realizing Selleck was in demand, CBS greenlit &quot;Magnum P.I.&quot;, forcing him to drop out and leaving the production with no lead actor only weeks before filming. The 1980 actors strike later put the show on hiatus for three months, which would have allowed Selleck to star as Jones.

Spielberg said Ford was perfect for the role after seeing him in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;; Kanzanjian said Ford had always been considered but not cast because he was already a well-known actor. Lucas was concerned about seeming reliant on Ford by casting him in another film after &quot;Star Wars&quot;, and he also did not think he would commit to three films. However, Ford thought it would be a fun project and agreed to the deal. He negotiated a seven-figure salary, a percentage of the gross profits, and the option to re-write his dialogue. Ford undertook extensive exercise to enhance his physique and trained for several weeks under stunt coordinator Glenn Randall to use a bullwhip, becoming proficient enough to disarm the Monkey Man (Vic Tablian); his wrist had to be rehabilitated to compensate for an old injury. Ford&#x27;s interpretation of the character was as an academic first and an adventurer second.

For Jones&#x27; love interest Marion, Spielberg wanted someone akin to early 20th-century leading female icons like Irene Dunne, Barbara Stanwyck, and Ann Sheridan, who equaled their male counterparts. Lucas wanted Debra Winger, but she was not interested, and Spielberg wanted his girlfriend Amy Irving, but she was unavailable. They also considered Stephanie Zimbalist, Barbara Hershey and Sean Young. Spielberg was aware of Karen Allen from her performance in &quot;Animal House&quot; (1978), portraying an independent female character, and she impressed him with her professionalism during auditions for &quot;Raiders&quot;. One of the first things Spielberg asked Allen was &quot;how well do you spit?&quot;. Allen developed a backstory for Marion that included her mother&#x27;s death and her relationship with Jones when she was 15–16, but Spielberg said it belonged in a different movie. Kasdan named Marion after his grandmother-in-law, and took Ravenwood from a Los Angeles street.

Belloq was intended to be a sophisticated villain to counter the &quot;beer-drinking&quot; hero. Spielberg cast Freeman after seeing him in the docudrama &quot;Death of a Princess&quot; (1980); Freeman&#x27;s piercing eyes had captivated him. Giancarlo Giannini and singer Jacques Dutronc were also considered. Danny DeVito was approached to portray Sallah, described as a skinny, tall Egyptian like Gunga Din in &quot;Gunga Din&quot; (1939). DeVito could not participate because of scheduling conflicts with his sitcom &quot;Taxi&quot; and because his agent wanted too much money. Rhys-Davies was cast based on his performance in the 1980 miniseries &quot;Shōgun&quot;. Spielberg asked him to play the character as a mix of his &quot;Shōgun&quot; role and the character John Falstaff. Ronald Lacey was cast as Toht because he reminded Spielberg of actor Peter Lorre. Klaus Kinski was offered the role but chose to appear in the horror film &quot;Venom&quot; (1981) because it offered more money.

=== Filming ===
Principal photography began on June 23, 1980. Filming took place on location in La Rochelle in France, Tunisia in North Africa, and Hawaii, and on sets at Elstree Studios, England. Elstree was chosen because it was well-staffed with artists and technicians who had worked on &quot;Star Wars&quot;. On-location shooting cost around $100,000 a day in addition to crew salaries; sets cost an additional $4million. The production could afford certain equipment only for a limited time, including a Panaglide camera stabilizer for smoother shots, and a camera crane for higher angles. To maintain the tight schedule, Spielberg said he &quot;...didn&#x27;t do 30 or 40 takes; usually only four... Had I had more time and money, it would have turned out a pretentious movie.&quot;

Filming began in La Rochelle, depicting the capture of the &quot;Bantu Wind&quot; by a Nazi U-boat. Watts borrowed a submarine from the war film &quot;Das Boot&quot; (1981) on condition it not be taken into deep waters. World War II German U-boat pens in La Rochelle represented the U-boat dock. An original coal-fired tramp steamer boat could not be found for filming, so an Egyptian boat found in an Irish port was decorated appropriately and sailed to France.

The production moved to Elstree Studios by June30. Interiors included the scene featuring an imam deciphering the staff headpiece and the Peruvian temple. There were repeated delays while filming the Well of Souls scene: there were too few snakes, a lack of anti-venom, and Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s daughter Vivian—who was visiting Kubrick on the set of &quot;The Shining&quot;—called the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) about the treatment of the snakes. The interior of Jones&#x27; school was filmed at The Royal Masonic School for Girls in Rickmansworth, in Hertfordshire; the exterior was the University of the Pacific in California.

Tunisia was used to portray Egypt. Spielberg described this phase as one of his worst filming experiences: the temperature was often over , and over 150 crew members became sick with amoebic dysentery from the local food. Spielberg was one of the few to remain healthy because he ate food and water he brought from England. Lucas also suffered a severe sunburn and facial swelling. The Cairo village was filmed in the city of Kairouan. A day of filming was lost there because over 300 TV antennas had to be removed from the surrounding houses. Budget constraints affected Spielberg&#x27;s desire to have 2,000 extras as diggers; he had to settle for 600. Stuntman Terry Richards, who portrayed the swordsman nonchalantly dispatched by Jones, spent weeks practicing sword skills for an extended fight scene. Ford was unable to perform for long periods while suffering from dysentery, and it was decided to shorten the fight scene significantly. The Sidi Bouhlel canyon near the city of Tozeur is where a rocket launcher-equipped Jones confronts the Nazis for the Ark. Lucas had used the canyon in &quot;Star Wars&quot; to portray the planet Tatooine. During the scene, a fly crawled onto Freeman&#x27;s lip during his dialogue, but he continued to deliver his lines. Although it appeared to be eaten, Freeman clarified it flew away.

In late September, filming moved to Hawaii for exterior shots for the film&#x27;s Peruvian opening. The Paramount logo dissolving into a natural mountain was an improvisation by Spielberg based on his own childhood habit of doing the same while making films; the mountain is Kalalea Mountain on the island of Kauaʻi. Though the scene appears to be a single location, it was shot across 10 areas in Hawaii, including the Huleia National Wildlife Refuge. It was originally more elaborate and longer, featuring an added betrayal by one of Jones&#x27; guides, resulting in a fight, and it had more dialogue; this was deemed unnecessary and removed for a tighter paced sequence. The cave&#x27;s exterior was considered a perfect location, though a nearby pool was a mosquito breeding ground; even with anti-mosquito equipment the crew was bitten. The donkeys used for the trek suffered lameness. It was difficult to find replacements, and eventually, a pair of gray donkeys were painted brown with colored hairspray and flown by helicopter to the Nā Pali Coast State Park to finish the scene.

The loosely detailed script led to much improvisation; where the script described three people talking in a room, in the film it took place in a quarry alongside 500 extras. Scenes like a student of Jones&#x27;s flashing the &quot;Love You&quot; message written across her eyelids and Marion putting on a dress to conceal a weapon were also improvised. Allen believed the latter scene focused on her character seducing Belloq, undermining her loyalty and love for Jones. She and Freeman collaborated to develop the idea of Marion getting Belloq drunk instead. Allen, Lacey, Freeman, and Rhys-Davies often spent time together between filming to talk and discuss their characters. Allen described Ford as a private person who would not discuss his character in detail, and it took her a while to adapt to his working style. Filming concluded in September 1980, after 73 days. Lucas described it as the film he had the fewest problems with because of the lack of studio interference.

===Post-production===
Post-production lasted about two months and focused mainly on special effects and pick-up shots. Spielberg&#x27;s first cut was close to three hours long before he and Kahn re-edited it to just under two hours. Lucas was happy with this edit, but later asked if he could shorten the ending. He and Kahn collaborated on the edit; Spielberg said he was happy with their changes. The final cut of the film runs for 115minutes. Marcia Lucas opined there was no emotional closure for Jones and Marion because she was absent following the closure of the Ark. Marcia is not credited in the film, but her suggestion led Spielberg to shoot a final exterior sequence on the steps of San Francisco City Hall showing Jones and Marion together.

Other changes included the addition of a scene where the Ark makes a humming noise in the &quot;Bantu Wind&quot; hold and the removal of a scene showing Jones holding on to the U-boat periscope to follow the Nazis; Spielberg thought it looked poor and hoped the audiences would not care how Jones accomplished the feat. Lucas removed a scene of a man fainting at the sight of Jones and Marion emerging from the Well of Souls because he thought the joke did not fit with the tone of the film. Shots of the Douglas DC-3 Jones and Marion use to fly out of Nepal were repurposed from the adventure film &quot;Lost Horizon&quot; (1973), and an establishing shot of the streets of Washington, D.C. was taken from &quot;The Hindenburg&quot; (1975). Spielberg justified the use of stock footage as cost-effective, and reasoned that only sharp-eyed viewers would notice. Special effects supervisor Richard Edlund claimed that the street scene was done with miniatures.

=== Music ===
John Williams composed the score for &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;. He said the music did not have to be serious for the film and was instead theatrical and excessive. Williams spent a few weeks working on the Indiana Jones theme, more commonly known as &quot;The Raiders March&quot; that plays during the main character&#x27;s heroic scenes. Two separate pieces were played for Spielberg, who wanted to use both. These pieces became the main theme and musical bridge of &quot;The Raiders March&quot;.

For the romantic theme, Williams took inspiration from older films like the drama &quot;Now, Voyager&quot; (1942) to create something more emotionally monumental that he felt would contrast well with the film&#x27;s humor and lighter moments. Williams used &quot;dark&quot; orchestral pieces to represent the actions of the Nazis, using the &quot;seventh degree on the scale of the bottom&quot;. He said this signified a militaristic evil. To create something suitably biblical for the Ark of the Covenant, he used a mix of chorus and orchestra.
==Design==
===Stunts===
The Peruvian temple interiors used in the film were life-sized sets. The giant boulder—made of fiberglass, plaster and wood—was designed to be wide, but this was reduced to , with the resulting prop weighing . Spielberg liked the effect and had its ramp extended to give it more screen time. The boulder was controlled by a steel rod concealed in the wall by rubber rock outcroppings. Ford performed the stunt ten times for the different camera angles. Spielberg said he was an idiot for letting Ford do it, but it would not have looked as good with a stuntman concealing his face. Ford performed as many of his stunts as was allowed throughout &quot;Raiders&quot;, suffering various injuries. The tarantulas on Molina&#x27;s body would not move because they were male and non-aggressive. A female spider was put on his chest to encourage movement. Abandoned ideas for the temple included a crushing wall trap and a pit concealed by spider-webs. The golden idol also had mechanically operated eyes that could follow Jones. For the last part of the scene where Jones flees by plane, the first take ended in near-disaster when the plane crashed from a height of because Ford&#x27;s dangling leg was blocking the aircraft&#x27;s right flap.

Filming of the Well of Souls scene was delayed initially by a lack of snakes. There were 500–600 snakes to use for close shots and some mechanical snakes for wider shots, but Spielberg wanted more. A request was made to snake handlers from around London and Europe who produced between 6,000 and 10,000 snakes in a few days. Afterward, they struggled to obtain anti-venom; with local supplies having expired, it had to be imported from India. Many of the snakes were harmless grass snakes or non-venomous pythons, but the cobras were positioned behind plexiglas to protect the cast and crew. Also present among the snakes were legless lizards. The stage doors were kept open during filming for quick access to a waiting ambulance. Spielberg recounted that Allen was so scared she could not scream on cue. He dropped a dead serpent on her to elicit a genuine reaction. Allen said she got used to the creatures after 3–4 days. Animal handler Steve Edge donned a dress and shaved his legs to stand in for Allen at specific points. Vivian Kubrick&#x27;s complaint to the RSPCA about the perceived poor treatment of the snakes required production to cease while safeguards were added.

Reynolds and production artist Ron Cobb created the BV-38 flying wing based on the Horten Ho 229, the Northrop N-1M and the Vought V-173. Constructed by the British engineering firm Vickers, it was dismantled and shipped to Tunisia. It was not designed to be flight-worthy, only to serve as a source of danger from its propellers. The plane was abandoned in Tunisia and slowly dismantled over the following decade by souvenir hunters before being demolished. The fight between Jones and the German underneath the plane was mainly improvised; Spielberg had to restrain himself from making it too long as each new idea led to another. During the fight, the moving vehicle rolled over Ford&#x27;s foot and towards his knee before it was stopped. It took 40 crew members to move it off of him. He avoided injury through a combination of the extreme Tunisian heat making the tire soft and the ground being covered in sand. Dysentery had left the production with a lack of stuntmen, and Spielberg had Marshall stand in as the flying wing pilot. The three-day shoot was one of Spielberg&#x27;s more difficult scenes to film, and he was reported saying he wanted to go home.

Second unit director Michael D. Moore filmed most of the truck chase. Spielberg had not used a second director before but agreed to it as the scene would take a long time to film being set in multiple locations. Moore completed wider shots where stuntmen stood in for Ford. He closely followed Spielberg&#x27;s storyboarding but innovated a few shots Spielberg considered improvements. Stuntman Glenn Randall suggested the scene of Jones traversing the underside of the truck. Ford sat in a concealed bicycle seat attached to the truck underside when clinging to its front. One of the convoy cars going over a cliff was a combination of matte painting background and stop motion animation of miniature figures falling out of the car.

===Special effects===
Lucas&#x27; Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM) handled the film&#x27;s special effects, under the supervision of Richard Edlund. The team worked on both &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; and the dark fantasy &quot;Dragonslayer&quot; (1981). He felt special effects were a financially economical method of delivering a good film; as long as they were emotionally involved in the story, he said audiences would buy into even a poor special effect. Spielberg liked practical effects because he could regularly check the raw footage during filming, rather than waiting months for the completed composite effects.

Freeman said he had no idea what was happening when he opened the Ark. He was told to imagine something coming towards him and to scream. Special effects artist Steve Gawley created the Ark&#x27;s spirits by suspending small robed puppets in a clouded water tank in front of a blue screen. They were shaken to create a natural movement that was composited into the live footage. A Lucasfilm receptionist, dressed in a long white robe, was suspended in the air in front of a blue screen for the close-up of the ghost. She was filmed moving away from the camera and the footage was reversed to create an inhuman movement. Her visage was composited with a skeletal model for the monstrous transformation.

Freeman, Lacey, and Kahler&#x27;s death scenes were created using different models. A mold was made of Kahler&#x27;s face; it was lined with bladders filled with air. Controlled by up to ten people, the air was removed to make the head shrivel. Special effects artist Chris Walas sculpted Lacey&#x27;s melting face using different colored layers of gelatin placed over a carved, heat-resistant stone skull. Propane heaters were used to melt the gelatin and filmed using a slower-than-normal camera so the effect appears to take place rapidly when played at normal speed. Belloq&#x27;s head mold contained a thin-plaster skull filled with blood bags and detritus. It was blown up using explosives, shotguns, and an air cannon. It took three attempts to get the desired effect. Belloq&#x27;s death was considered so extreme the Motion Picture Association of America initially classified the film with an R rating restricting it to those over the age of 17 without an adult. Flames were superimposed over the scene to conceal the effect.

Kasdan scripted detailed montages during the transition between locations, but Spielberg saved money by showing a map and an animated line traveling between destinations. Skulls and rotting bodies made by chief make-up artist Tom Smith filled the Well of Souls catacombs. To get the monkey to perform a Nazi salute, the trainer hit it on the head to make it touch the affected area. When this did not work, the filmmakers hung a grape over its head to encourage it to reach up; it took 50 takes to capture. A partially deaf rat was used for the scene of the ark humming in the hold of the &quot;Bantu Wind&quot;, giving it a unique and unnatural head movement.

===Visuals and sound===
Matte paintings were used to create more elaborate backgrounds: these included the establishing shot of Marion&#x27;s Nepalese bar and the warehouse where the Ark is later stored, the latter painted by Michael Pangrazio. Spielberg disliked the painting of the China Clipper plane (by Alan Maley) as he did not think it looked real against the water they had filmed. Jones&#x27; attire—a leather jacket and khaki pants—was based on Humphrey Bogart&#x27;s in &quot;The Treasure of the Sierra Madre&quot; (1948) and Charlton Heston in &quot;Secret of the Incas&quot; (1954). Costume designer Deborah Nadoolman Landis dumped boxes of hats on the floor for Ford to try on. After picking the right style, she purchased an Australian model she aged with Fuller&#x27;s earth and mineral oil, and then scrunched beneath a bed. The hat allowed them to create a recognizable image even in silhouette. Designer Ralph McQuarrie was responsible for the Ark decorations.

Spielberg wanted a moodier film noir lighting style like in &quot;The Informer&quot; (1935). In contrast, Slocombe wanted to make things brighter and used backlighting to create a greater depth of field; Spielberg preferred his changes. Slocombe often employed natural light, using solar position predictions to plot a scene&#x27;s layout. Spielberg liked the beams of sunlight glimpsed through scenery and tasked special effects artist Kit West with using a smoke machine to create artificial sunlight shards. For the bar fight, Spielberg wanted pitch-black shadows on the wall, but the lighting required to achieve this would have shrouded the actors&#x27; eyes; he settled for subtler shadings. He also wanted to illuminate the Well of Souls with a lighting effect through the ceiling opening, but once this was sealed it no longer made sense. The flaming torches used in the scene did not provide enough light, so he opted to use an artificial light source. Spielberg noted Allen always looked beautiful in her scenes because Slocombe spent twice as long setting up her lighting as he did Ford&#x27;s.

Sound effects supervisor Ben Burtt recorded the film&#x27;s many sounds. The snake slithering is a mix of Burtt running his hands through cheese casserole and wet sponges being dragged across grip tape; the rolling boulder is a Honda Civic driving down a gravel hill; and the Ark lid opening is the sound of a toilet cistern being opened. The Ark spirits are the cries of sea lions and dolphins filtered through a vocoder. Jones&#x27; revolver is the sound of a Winchester rifle firing, while his whip-crack was made by recording Ford using the whip.

=== Context ===

By the summer of 1981 (June–September), the film industry had been in decline for over a year. This was the result of few box office successes, rising film production costs, diminishing audiences, and increasing ticket prices. The season was predicted to be down 10% or $250million against the previous year. Over 60 films were scheduled for release—more than the previous year—by studios eager to make the next blockbuster film. This increased competition to attract audiences, mainly those aged 12 to 24, at the most profitable time of the year.

The superhero film &quot;Superman II&quot; was expected to dominate the season, and based on industry experts and audience polling, films including &quot;History of the World, Part I&quot;, the latest James Bond film &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot;, and &quot;The Great Muppet Caper&quot;, were also expected to perform well. Conversely, audience polling by CinemaScore showed little awareness or anticipation for &quot;Raiders&quot; until nationwide previews a week before its release. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported Paramount had provided theater owners with a more beneficial deal than usual to ensure &quot;Raiders&quot; was screened in the best theaters and locations.

Featuring two camels, an elephant, and a python, the press event for the film cost $10,000. Film prints were supplied to theaters in lead-sealed containers to prevent tampering alongside a letter to theater managers stating they were responsible for any misuse of the film. This letter inspired a whistleblower at one theater to alert Paramount of the planned theft of a &quot;Raiders&quot; print to make pirated copies. The 1,200 film prints cost an estimated $1.7million. The theatrical release poster was created by Richard Amsel.

=== Box office ===
In the United States (U.S.) and Canada, &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; was released on June12, 1981, in 1,078 theaters. The film earned $8.3million—an average of $7,705 per theater, and finished as the number one film of the weekend, ahead of the debuts of &quot;Clash of the Titans&quot; ($6.6million) and &quot;History of the World, Part I&quot; ($4.9million). The film fell to the number three position in its second weekend with an additional gross of $8million—a decline of only four percent—behind the debuts of &quot;The Cannonball Run&quot; ($11.8million) and &quot;Superman II&quot; ($14.1million). By its fourth week, &quot;Raiders&quot; began climbing box office charts, reaching the number two position with a gross of $7.3million, behind &quot;Superman II&quot; ($10.9million). In its sixth week, it regained the number one position with $6.4million. The film spent most of the following nine weeks as the number one film, and forty-weeks straight as one of the top ten highest-grossing films. It was declared the top box office film of the summer by early September, with a total approximate gross of $125million. Of this figure, $72 million was estimated to have been returned to the studio; the profit-sharing deal with Spielberg and Lucas meant that after marketing costs, Paramount had earned $23million in profit.

The film remained a steady success; six months after its release, industry executives joked &quot;Raiders&quot; would be the year&#x27;s big Christmas film. The film officially left theaters on March18, 1982, although some were still playing it by July. &quot;Raiders&quot; earned an approximate total box office gross of $212.2million, making it the highest-grossing film of 1981, ahead of &quot;On Golden Pond&quot; ($119.3million), &quot;Superman II&quot; ($108.1million), and &quot;Stripes&quot; ($85.3million). An estimate by Box Office Mojo suggests over 77million tickets were bought to see the film. &quot;Raiders&quot; remains the &quot;leggiest&quot; film ever released, referring to the difference between the highest-weekend gross and the time taken to achieve the overall total gross.

Outside the U.S. and Canada, &quot;Raiders&quot; earned a further $141.7million, making it the highest-grossing film ahead of &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; ($140.5million) and &quot;Superman II&quot; ($82.2million). In total, the film earned a worldwide gross of $354million, making it the highest-grossing film of 1981 worldwide, again ahead of &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; ($195.3million) and &quot;Superman II&quot; ($190.4million).

&quot;Raiders&quot; has been re-released several times, first in July 1982, when it earned an additional $21.4million and again in March 1983, when the film earned an additional $11.4million. A remastered IMAX version, supervised by Spielberg, was released in 267 U.S. and Canadian theaters. The success of the release led to the run being extended to 300 additional theaters. These releases have raised the film&#x27;s worldwide theatrical gross to an estimated $389.9million.

The record $1.95billion summer box-office of 1981 represented a 15.6% increase over 1980, with a 22.5% increase in ticket sales. This success was attributed mainly to &quot;Raiders&quot; and &quot;Superman II&quot;. The most successful film genres of the year offered fun, comedy, and escapism. &quot;Superman II&quot; broke box office records, but it was &quot;Raiders&quot; that earned the most money and played in theaters for over a year. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that audiences considered other films only if both &quot;Superman II&quot; and &quot;Raiders&quot; were sold out. It became one of the top-four highest-grossing films ever, a list dominated by Lucas and Spielberg with &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, &quot;Jaws&quot;, and &quot;Star Wars&quot;.

==Reception==
=== Critical response ===

&quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; was released to general critical acclaim. The National Board of Review and critic Vincent Canby listed it as one of the ten best films of the year. Canby labeled the film an &quot;instant classic&quot; and one of the most humorous and stylish American films ever made. He described it as having refined the old serial films into their most perfect form for a modern audience. Roger Ebert called it a series of &quot;breathless and incredible&quot; adventures inspired by and celebrating childhood stories told in comic books and movies. He concluded the film was successful in its singular goal of entertaining, creating an adventure epic in the vein of &quot;Star Wars&quot;, the James Bond films, and &quot;Superman&quot;. Writing for &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, Arthur Knight said a constant stream of thrills kept the film moving at a steady pace. Writing for &quot;Variety&quot;, Stephen Klain called the film &quot;exhilarating escapist entertainment&quot;. He continued that the film successfully balanced action, comedy, and suspense with mystical mythologies. Michael Sragow described it as the &quot;ultimate Saturday action matinee&quot;. Gene Siskel said it was as entertaining as a &quot;commercial movie&quot; could be, the kind of film that makes children excited about cinema.

Richard Schickel called it a return to form for Spielberg, demonstrating a competence not seen since &quot;Jaws&quot;. He described it as a film Walt Disney would have made were he still alive, featuring an &quot;enchanting&quot; combination of fantasy and cinematic movement. Stanley Kauffmann said while the film&#x27;s thrills did work on him, the frequency eventually irritated him. He criticized the film&#x27;s reliance on nostalgia and updating older films instead of innovating new ideas. Pauline Kael was critical of the film, saying Lucas and Spielberg had thought like marketers in creating a film that would appeal to the broadest masses. Kael said though &quot;Raiders&quot; was a sophisticated update of older serials, avoiding cliches with clever editing, it was too focused on surpassing each previous action spectacle to the detriment of characterization or plot progression. She opined the failure of &quot;1941&quot; had made Spielberg too cautious, and scenes evidenced he was rushing and not achieving the best possible take as in his previous work. Lucas later named a villain in his 1988 fantasy film &quot;Willow&quot; after Kael. Dave Kehr said the constant rush between setpieces felt monotonous. He also criticized the story for allowing the hero to choose to rescue the Ark over his romantic interest on multiple occasions, believing it made Indiana Jones difficult to support.

Ebert said the amusing and unusual characters elevated the film beyond just a technical accomplishment. He described Ford&#x27;s performance as taciturn and stubborn character in the vein of Humphrey Bogart in &quot;The Treasure of the Sierra Madre&quot;, but with the ability to laugh at himself. Klain said Ford&#x27;s performance was &quot;riveting&quot;, marking a major career highlight. Canby described Ford and Allen as both &quot;endearingly resilient&quot;. Ebert said Allen gives Marion a charming toughness. Knight appreciated Marion did not become idiotic when the male star was in danger. His review concluded the character was the definition of an activist. Sragow said Allen&#x27;s physical performance made her every bit the equal of Ford, and her vitality provided a positive counter to Ford&#x27;s deadpan performance. Kael was critical of many cast performances, feeling they were stilted and heavily scripted. She singled out Freeman for praise, however, for continuing his performance after a fly crawled into his mouth; Freeman jokingly called it the best review of his career. Klain praised the film&#x27;s performances, including Lacey&#x27;s Toht, which he called &quot;the most outrageously offensive Nazi stereotype seen on screen since World War II&quot;.

Canby, Knight and &quot;Variety&quot; singled out the opening of the Ark as one of the film&#x27;s best special effects. Knight said the effects artists deserved a &quot;special accolade&quot; for their work. Canby described it as a visual display as &quot;dazzling&quot; as the denouement of Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;. Ebert said the truck chase stunt was the best he had ever seen, ahead of those in films like &quot;Bullitt&quot; (1968) and &quot;The French Connection&quot; (1971). Aljean Harmetz, Klain, and Siskel asserted the film&#x27;s PG rating—meaning any child could see it unsupervised—was too lenient for such a scary film filled with a variety of on-screen deaths. An intermediate rating between PG and R, PG-13, would not be introduced until 1984, in part a response to the violence of the Indiana Jones prequel, &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot;. Some children were reported to have suffered nightmares afterward.

===Awards and accolades===
At the 1982 Academy Awards, &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; received five awards: Best Art Direction (Norman Reynolds, Leslie Dilley, and Michael D. Ford); Best Film Editing (Michael Kahn); Best Sound (Bill Varney, Steve Maslow, Gregg Landaker, and Roy Charman); Best Sound Editing (Ben Burtt and Richard L. Anderson); and Best Visual Effects (Richard Edlund, Kit West, Bruce Nicholson, and Joe Johnston). The film received a further four nominations: Best Picture; Best Director; Best Cinematography; and Best Original Score. It tied with the drama film &quot;Ragtime&quot; for the third-most nominations, behind &quot;On Golden Pond&quot; and &quot;Reds&quot;.

For the 39th Golden Globe Awards, &quot;Raiders&quot; received one nomination for Best Director. At the 9th Saturn Awards, &quot;Raiders&quot; won seven awards, including Best Fantasy Film, Best Actor (Ford), Best Actress (Allen), Best Director, Best Music (Williams), Best Writing (Kasdan), and Best Special Effects (Edlund). Spielberg received a Directors Guild Award nomination.

The 35th British Academy Film Awards earned the film one award for Best Production Design (Reynolds), and a further six nominations: Best Film; Best Supporting Actor for Elliott; Best Original Music; Best Cinematography; Best Editing; and Best Sound for Charman, Burtt, and Bill Varney. The film also received a Grammy Award for Williams&#x27; score, a People&#x27;s Choice Award for Favorite Motion Picture, a Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, and a nomination for Best Original Screenplay at the 34th Writers Guild of America Awards.

=== Home media ===
In the early 1980s, the videocassette recorder (VCR) home video market was rapidly gaining popularity. In previous years, VHS sales were not a revenue source for studios, but by 1983 they could generate up to 13% of a film&#x27;s total revenue; the U.S. and Canadian cassette rights could generate $500,000 alone. In November 1983, Paramount released a record 500,000 home video copies of &quot;Raiders&quot;, priced at $39.95. Paramount priced their home videos significantly lower than their competition, reasoning it would broaden the sales audience and promote home video watching. By September 1985, over one million copies of the film had sold, making it the bestselling VHS of its time. In 1991, McDonald&#x27;s launched possibly &quot;the largest video sales promotion...to date&quot; during which videocassettes of the first three Indiana Jones movies were sold at their restaurants for $5.99 each. Almost 10 million cassettes of the Indiana Jones series had been sold by this point. This promotion was expected to sell at least five million more. By 2000, the film was marketed as &quot;Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; for consistency with other titles in the franchise.

In 2003, the film was released on DVD as a bundle with the other two films in the franchise. Like the VHS, it was a success, selling over one million units and becoming the fastest-selling DVD box set. This set introduced additional materials including &quot;Making the Films&quot;, a two-hour documentary about the making of the films including deleted scenes, and &quot;Behind the Scenes&quot;, a series of archival featurettes. The film and its sequels were released as a collection on Blu-ray disc in 2012, as &quot;Indiana Jones: The Complete Adventures&quot;. Spielberg worked on the films&#x27; restoration for the higher-quality format. This release included the additional content of previous releases. For its 40th anniversary in 2021, the film was released in a remastered 4K resolution Ultra HD Blu-ray based on the original film negative, as part of a boxset including the series&#x27; other films. This version was released individually in 2023.

===Other media===

&quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; has been represented across a wide variety of merchandise, including comic books, video games, novels, Lego sets, action figures and vehicles, playsets, candles, and board games.

It has received several game adaptations. &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; was released in 1982 for the Atari 2600 console. A pinball game, &quot;Indiana Jones: The Pinball Adventure&quot;, was released in 1993, and a platform game, &quot;Indiana Jones&#x27; Greatest Adventures&quot;, was released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System the following year. &quot;Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine&quot; (1999) includes a bonus level that returns players to the Peruvian temple. The Lego-themed adventure game &quot;Lego Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures&quot; (2008) and its 2009 sequel &quot;Lego Indiana Jones 2: The Adventure Continues&quot; represent the film and its sequels. A 1984 boardgame, &quot;The Adventures of Indiana Jones role playing game&quot;, was poorly received, and when the manufacturer lost the license later that decade, all remaining copies had to be burned. All that remained from the destruction were encased in plastic and turned into the Diana Jones Award—&quot;...diana Jones&quot; being the only legible part of the burnt remains.

A novelization of the film, written by Campbell Black, was released in 1981. The book was a worldwide sales success and included details not present in the film. Among them is Marion was aged 15 when she and Jones began their relationship, the staff of Ra headpiece has explicit instructions not to look at the opened Ark, and Brody finds Jones at home after having just entertained one of his students. Black, who was paid $35,000 plus royalties, sued Lucasfilm in 2005 for not paying him his percentage of the book sales profits. Marvel Comics produced a comic book adaptation of the film shortly after its release.

The &quot;Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular!&quot; is a live amusement show at Walt Disney World Resort, Florida, that has been in operation since 1989. It features several live stunts based on set pieces from the film. &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; was also one of several films that made up the Great Movie Ride (1989–2017).
==Themes and analysis==
===Rejection of Nazism===
&quot;Raiders&quot; can be interpreted as a Jewish fantasy about punishing the Nazis for the Holocaust. Spielberg is Jewish, and the Ark is a Jewish artifact described as holding the Ten Commandments passed down to the Jewish people by God. In biblical descriptions, the Ark is a gold-plated wooden box that must be carried with poles because it is too holy to be touched. Although the Nazi regime persecuted the Jewish people, in the film, they needed to use a Jewish artifact to subjugate the world; however, the artifact was too pure and holy for them to touch and actively rejected them by destroying their symbol emblazoned on the Ark&#x27;s transportation crate while leaving the crate itself unharmed. Eventually, it also destroys the Nazi forces that open it. The Nazis are stopped by the literal intervention of Godly power that leaves the perceived protagonists unharmed.

In another scene, Jones falls underneath a moving truck when its hood-ornament, a Mercedes logo, snaps, mocking Mercedes&#x27; involvement in aiding the Nazis. Elizabeth Hirschman identified elements of the metaphysical, believing the standard heroic quest was offset by the religious importance of the Ark, an item of Judeo-Christian belief. The image of God is one that is inherently on the side of the good, and the destruction of the Nazi villains draws parallels to Yahweh visiting plagues on Egypt for enslaving the Israelites.

===Cinematic homage===
&quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; is a pastiche of cinematic history, inspired by and referring to many films. Spielberg stated explicitly the film is about movies and designed as a tribute to filmmaking. Alongside directly referred inspirations like early 20th-century serials, the film contains references to &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; (1941), the film noir &quot;Kiss Me Deadly&quot; (1955), the samurai film &quot;Yojimbo&quot; (1961), and the epic &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; (1962), among others. &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; is referred to directly in &quot;Raiders&quot;″s last scene where the Ark is secured in a vast warehouse, a fate similar to that of the beloved childhood sled belonging to &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;″s principal character. &quot;Raiders&quot; also refers to several of Lucas&#x27;s own films: the translation of the German announcement is &quot;1138&quot;, a reference to science fiction film &quot;THX 1138&quot; (1971); and numerous nods to &quot;Star Wars&quot; including the characters of R2-D2 and appearing as hieroglyphs inside the Well of Souls. Richard Crinkley recounted audience members of &quot;King David&quot; (1985) associated its use of the Ark explicitly with &quot;Raiders&quot; instead of its biblical origins. He deemed this an example of &quot;cinemate visual literacy&quot;, an increasing number of people educated by visual media rather than text.

===Sociology===
One of the film&#x27;s themes—shared with &quot;Superman II&quot; (released the same year in the United States)—has been interpreted as American security being put at risk. These films are emblematic of their time and the contemporary fears of American citizens. The Nazi characters are based on a former threat to America, and like &quot;Superman II&quot;, &quot;Raiders&quot; requires the intervention of a superhuman character to prevent destruction at the hands of enemy forces—a character audiences can admire, but never possibly emulate. Janet Maslin argues that the fantasy of these films and the larger-than-life characters are designed to satisfy audiences who do not want to reflect on the world around them. Jones is striving to recover the Ark both to stop the Nazis but also for personal glory, but the film never dwells on the regular people around the world who would be affected by an invincible Nazi army.

&quot;Raiders&quot; offers a counter to the American national embarrassments of the controversial Vietnam War (1955–1975), the Watergate scandal (1972), a recession, and the growing influence of foreign nations. The period setting of the film also presents audiences with a time tinged in romantic nostalgia and filled with the possibility for adventure. Robin Wood wrote that &quot;Raiders&quot;, &quot;Superman&quot;, and &quot;Star Wars&quot; provide a familiar, comforting content using the nostalgic memories of the older serial films of which they are derivative, presenting an idealized vision of older traditional values. Wood opined the purpose of this was to subdue contemporary radical social movements eager for change. Jennifer Barker suggested that &quot;Raiders&quot; offers audiences what they want, and does not challenge their values or beliefs as anything but correct.

The macho male action hero archetype of the era, conveyed by Jones, can also be seen as reinforcing traditional masculinity in the face of growing feminism. Describing the typical interpretation of this archetype, Latham Hunter said films such as &quot;Raiders&quot;, &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; (1987), and &quot;Die Hard&quot; (1988) evolve the everyman character into someone who can overcome impossible odds and promote American might. Jones is an American hero who steps in reluctantly to save the world by overcoming almost exclusively foreign enemies. Barker argues that Jones is an individualist placed in opposition to a fascist or totalitarian regime, making &quot;Raiders&quot; a &quot;conservative serial fantasy&quot; film. Hunter believed this focus on masculinity was short sighted, and these films succeeded because they offered escapism from reality, and presented an outclassed hero who reflected the audiences&#x27; own feelings of powerlessness.

Jones has been criticized as a poor portrayal of an archaeologist and that his actions amount to theft. Archaeologist Winifred Creamer described Jones as the &quot;worst thing to happen to archaeology&quot; as he &quot;walks a fine line between what&#x27;s an archaeologist and what&#x27;s a professional looter.&quot; Kevin McGeough wrote that the archetypal film archaeologist in older films was never the hero, but often a subject to be saved or conquered by the actual hero. Jones is imbued with the self-reliance and physical competence of the traditional hero, but with an intelligence that is recognized and celebrated, setting him apart from older heroes. Even so, Jones is hunting the Ark, in part, for personal glory attached to its recovery. When given the opportunity to destroy it to prevent its misuse, Belloq calls his bluff and Jones backs down. Belloq suggests he is a skewed reflection of Jones, and only a small change would turn Jones into Belloq.

In her argument that the film is about colonialism, Tatiana Prorokova identified Jones and the Nazis as all-Caucasian males invading foreign lands, belonging to people of color, to steal a local treasure for their own personal benefit. In dismissing the supernatural aspects of the Ark, Jones also dismisses its cultural significance, rendering it a prize to be collected for his sake. As the hero, Jones represents the United States&#x27; unfettered right to protect the Ark from others. Although according to Lucas the character of Indiana is named after his childhood dog, Prorokova insists that the hero is named for the U.S. state of Indiana, a state named after wars against Native Americans by colonizers. &quot;Raiders&quot; is set at a time when much of the world lived under colonial rule, and the film presents the non-white characters either as subjugated by the Nazis and reliant on a white American for aid or as collaborating with the Nazis.

==Legacy==
&quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; has had a lasting effect on popular culture. It is considered a touchstone of modern cinema, creating a film framework still emulated by other films. Spielberg has said he considers it the most perfect film of the series because he never wanted to modify it or change anything about it.

Ford&#x27;s performance led to his casting in the 1982 science fiction cult classic film &quot;Blade Runner&quot;. Kasdan became one of the most in-demand writers in Hollywood, and helped write Lucas&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars&quot; sequel, &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1980). Despite opening new opportunities for Allen, she expressed disappointment with the film because her character was motivated more by her relationship with Jones and financial gain than with her father and his obsession with the Ark. She unsuccessfully lobbied for rewrites to address this and explore her character further. Even so, Allen affirmed that many women and girls had appreciated and been inspired by her character. Forty years after the film&#x27;s release, Allen affirmed she still received positive feedback from young women. Shortly after the film&#x27;s release, Stanley Rader and Robert Kuhn filed a lawsuit against the filmmakers for $210million alleging the film was based on &quot;Ark&quot;, a screenplay and unpublished novel by Kuhn. The outcome of this lawsuit is unknown.

The film led to an increase in students studying archaeology, and many modern archaeologists have cited the film as an inspiration. Rhys-Davies said he had met over 150 lecturers, professors, and archaeologists who told him their interest in the field began with the film. The original Indiana Jones costume hat and jacket were stored indiscriminately after filming, at Lucas&#x27;s Skywalker Ranch, until 2012. Nadoolman Landis recovered the items to be exhibited as part of a Hollywood costume display at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.

===Cultural influence===
In 1999, the United States Library of Congress selected the film to be preserved in the National Film Registry for being culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant. Assessing the film&#x27;s legacy in 1997, Bernard Weinraub, opined &quot;the decline in the traditional family G-rated film, for &#x27;general&#x27; audiences, probably began...&quot; with &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;. He continued, &quot;whether by accident or design... the filmmakers made a comic nonstop action film intended mostly for adults but also for children&quot;. Lucas&#x27; frequent collaborator Gary Kurtz said that &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; marked the turning point where Lucas became convinced that audiences cared more about &quot;the roller-coaster ride&quot; than the story.

Authors, actors, and filmmakers have spoken of their appreciation for &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; or cited it as an inspiration in their own careers, including Chris Carter, Hugh Jackman, Simon Kinberg, Jon Turteltaub, Dan Brown, and Joe Johnston. The experience had an explicit influence on Johnston&#x27;s directorial effort &quot;Captain America: The First Avenger&quot; (2011), including character designs. Director Steven Soderbergh released a black-and-white edit of the film in 2014, removing all the original sounds, intending for viewers to focus on Spielberg&#x27;s staging and editing. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it was among the action films director James Gunn recommended people watch, and one of the 35 films recommended by &quot;The Independent&quot;.

The film has inspired or been referred to in other media including film, television shows, and video games. Between 1982 and 1989, in Ocean Springs, Mississippi, children Chris Strompolos, Eric Zala, and Jayson Lamb made an amateur remake of the film, &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark: The Adaptation&quot;. Spielberg congratulated the trio on their accomplishment.

===Critical reassessment===
&quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; is considered one of the greatest films ever made. As part of his &quot;The Great Movies&quot; series, Ebert said while the special effects had not aged well, they were perfect for this type of film. He concluded it was a &quot;whiz-bang slamarama&quot; made with &quot;heedless joy&quot;. The British Film Institute called it one of the ten greatest action films of all time, saying &quot;for all its barnstorming staging and boy&#x27;s-own-adventure larks, it&#x27;s refreshing Indy&#x27;s greatest foil comes in three dimensions... the hard-drinking, wise-cracking, upstagingly brilliant Karen Allen&quot;. A 2014 poll of 2,120 entertainment-industry members by &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; ranked it the thirteenth best film ever made. It is also listed in the film reference book &quot;1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die&quot;.

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a approval rating from the aggregated reviews of critics, with an average rating of . The consensus reads, &quot;Featuring bravura set pieces, sly humor, and white-knuckle action, &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; is one of the most consummately entertaining adventure pictures of all time.&quot; The film has a score of 86 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 15 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. In 2005, the Writers Guild of America&#x27;s (WGA) listed the film&#x27;s screenplay as the forty-second greatest screenplay of the preceding 75 years on their 101 Greatest Screenplays list. &quot;Empire&quot; listed the film at number two on its 2008 list of the 500 Greatest Movies of All Time, behind the 1972 crime film &quot;The Godfather&quot;. They said, &quot;no adventure movie is quite so efficiently entertaining&quot;. In 1997, the American Film Institute (AFI) ranked &quot;Raiders&quot; number60 on its 100 Years...100 Movies list recognizing the best American films. They reassessed to number66 in the 2007 anniversary edition. On the AFI&#x27;s list of the 100 Best Thrills, the film was ranked number10, and the 2003 list of the 100 Best Heroes &amp; Villains ranked the Indiana Jones character as the number two hero, behind Atticus Finch from &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; (1962).

Several publications have ranked it as one of the greatest films of all time, including number two by &quot;Empire&quot;, number five by &quot;Time Out&quot;, and number19 by MSN. It has also appeared on lists of the best action films, including number two by &quot;IGN&quot;, number nine by &quot;Time Out&quot; (down from number two in an earlier ranking) and number11 by &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; also named it the best action film of the 1980s. Rotten Tomatoes and &quot;Esquire&quot; have labeled it one of the greatest adventure films. Film critic Bilge Ebiri, writing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, considered it the best film in Spielberg&#x27;s filmography as of 2018, stating that &quot;Its effects and technique are dazzling; it&#x27;s a perfect blend of jaw-dropping spectacle and the sort of actor-driven movie-movie moments that are redolent of Golden-Age-of-Hollywood classics; and it&#x27;s as perfect a piece of pure, uncut entertainment as anyone has produced in the last few decades.&quot;

Channel 4 viewers in the United Kingdom ranked &quot;Raiders&quot; as the 20th best family film of all time in 2005. In the 2010s, &quot;Empire&quot; magazine readers named it the seventh-best film of all time, and it was ranked the sixteenth best film of all time, based on IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes user votes and critical ratings. Readers of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; voted it the number one summer film, ahead of competition including &quot;Jaws&quot; and &quot;Alien&quot; (1979).

A 2013 episode of the sitcom &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; (&quot;The Raiders Minimization&quot;) argues that Jones accomplishes nothing in &quot;Raiders&quot;, as the Nazis would have eventually found the Ark, opened it, and died regardless of Jones&#x27;s actions. An essay by &quot;Esquire&quot;″s Matt Pomroy agreed, with the caveat that Marion would have almost certainly died at Toht&#x27;s hands, and the Ark would have been flown to Germany on the Flying Wing and opened for Hitler, likely killing him. However, Jones&#x27;s involvement ensures the Americans secure the Ark, preventing the Germans from using it.

==Sequels and spin-offs==

The success of &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; has spawned four other films. &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot; was in development by 1982, while the original was still in theaters. A narrative prequel to &quot;Raiders&quot;, &quot;Temple of Doom&quot; follows Jones&#x27;s quest to recover sacred stones and liberate the slaves of a Thuggee cult leader. The film became one of the highest-grossing films of 1984 and broke box office records, but fared less well with critics who accused it of racism, sexism, and containing content inappropriate for child audiences.

A narrative sequel to &quot;Raiders&quot;, &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot;, was released in 1989. It serves as the final film of the original trilogy and follows Jones and his father, portrayed by Sean Connery, on a quest to recover the Holy Grail. Like its predecessor, &quot;The Last Crusade&quot; broke box office records, becoming one of the year&#x27;s highest-grossing films. It was also well received by critics. Spielberg has said the film was, in part, an &quot;apology&quot; for the reception to &quot;Temple of Doom&quot;. Following the conclusion of the film series, Lucas developed a television series, &quot;The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles&quot; (1992–1993), featuring Ford and other actors as Jones at different ages.

A fourth film was released in 2008, titled &quot;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot;. It features the return of Allen as Marion Ravenwood and introduces Shia LaBeouf as her and Jones&#x27; son. The setting moved from the 1930s to the 1950s, pitting Jones against Russians to recover a crystal skull. The film was a financial success but polarized critics and fans. As with &quot;Temple of Doom&quot;, Lucas and Spielberg have defended the film and apologized for its reception. A fifth film, &quot;Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny&quot;, was released in June 2023.

Novels, comic books, and video games have also been released detailing the further adventures of Indiana Jones and his supporting cast from the films. Often set before and after the events of the films, these globe-spanning tales depict Jones&#x27; first marriage, and his adventures to discover the Spear of Destiny, Merlin, an Infernal Machine in the Tower of Babel, the Covenant of Buddha, the staff of Moses, the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone, dinosaurs, a Unicorn horn, the Oracle of Delphi, the secrets of the Sphinx, Noah&#x27;s Ark, and the fate of Atlantis. Jones is sometimes aided by Sallah in his conflicts against Belloq and Lao Che (from &quot;Temple of Doom&quot;), among others.

<text>Delaware County is a county located in the US state of New York. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 44,308. The county seat is Delhi. The county is named after the Delaware River, which was named in honor of Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr, appointed governor of Virginia in 1609. The county is part of the Southern Tier region of the state.

==History==

When counties were established in New York State in 1683, the present area of Delaware County was divided between Albany and Ulster Counties.

Albany County was an enormous county, including the northern part of New York State as well as all of the present State of Vermont and, in theory, extending westward to the Pacific Ocean. This county was reduced in size on July 3, 1766, by the creation of Cumberland County, and further on March 16, 1770, by the creation of Gloucester County, both containing territory now in Vermont. On March 12, 1772, what was left of Albany County was split into three parts, one remaining under the name Albany County. One of the other pieces, Tryon County, contained the western portion (and thus, since no western boundary was specified, theoretically still extended west to the Pacific). The eastern boundary of Tryon County was approximately five miles west of the present city of Schenectady, and the county included the western part of the Adirondack Mountains and the area west of the West Branch of the Delaware River. The area then designated as Tryon County now includes 37 counties of New York State. The county was named for William Tryon, British colonial governor of New York.

In the years prior to 1776, most of the Loyalists in Tryon County fled to Canada. In 1784, following the peace treaty that ended the American Revolutionary War, the name of Tryon County was changed to Montgomery County to honor the general, Richard Montgomery, who had captured several places in Canada and died attempting to capture the city of Quebec, replacing the name of Tryon.

During the late 1780s, New York State governor De Witt Clinton issued land grants to military officers, doctors and other veterans of the American Revolutionary War, which brought many patriot veterans to settle in the area.

In 1789, Montgomery County was reduced in size by the splitting off of Ontario County. The actual area split off from Montgomery County was much larger than the present county, also including the present Allegany, Cattaraugus, Chautauqua, Erie, Genesee, Livingston, Monroe, Niagara, Orleans, Steuben, Wyoming, Yates, and part of Schuyler and Wayne Counties.

In 1791, Otsego was one of three counties that were split off from Montgomery (the other two being Herkimer and Tioga Counties).

Ulster County was an original county of New York State, considerably larger than the present Ulster County, and at the time that Delaware County was created it still contained most of its original area.

Delaware County was formed in 1797 by combining portions of Otsego and Ulster counties.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (1.7%) is water. It is the fifth-largest county in New York by land area.

Delaware County is located in the southern part of the state, separated from the state of Pennsylvania by the Delaware River. It is east of Binghamton and southwest of Albany. The county contains part of the Catskill Mountains. The county is within a region called the Southern Tier of New York State.

The highest point is an approximately summit of Bearpen Mountain along the Greene County line. The lowest point is along the Delaware River. The county is drained by the headwaters of the Delaware. It has a hilly surface, and the soil in the valleys is exceedingly fertile. The Delaware and Susquehanna rivers are here navigable by boats.

<doc id="54168" wikidata="Q8621" url="?curid=54168" title="Terni">
<text>Terni ( ; ; ) is a city in the southern portion of the region of Umbria, in Central Italy. It is near the border with Lazio. The city is the capital of the province of Terni, located in the plain of the River Nera. It is northeast of Rome and 81 km south of the regional capital, Perugia.

The Latin name means &quot;between-two-rivers&quot;, in reference to its location on the confluence of the Nera river (Ancient Umbrian &quot;Nahar&quot;, ) and the Serra stream. When disambiguation was needed, it was referred to as &quot;Interamna Nahars&quot;. Its inhabitants were known in Latin as &quot;Interamnātēs Na(ha)rtēs&quot;.

Interamna was founded as an Ancient Roman town, albeit settlements in the Terni area well precede this occurrence. During the 19th century, steel mills were introduced and led the city to have a role in the Second Industrial Revolution in Italy. Because of its industrial importance, the city was heavily bombed during World War II by the Allies. It remains an industrial hub and has been nicknamed &quot;The Steel City&quot;.

Terni is also known as the &quot;City of Lovers&quot;, as its patron saint, Saint Valentine, was born and became a bishop here, and the remains are preserved in the basilica-sanctuary in his honour.

==History==

The city was founded around the 7th century BC by the Umbrians &quot;Nahartes&quot;, in a territory inhabited (as testified by archaeological excavations) as early as the Bronze Age. The Iguvine Tablets describe these &quot;Nahartes&quot; as a strong, numerous people and as the most important enemy of the Umbrian people of Gubbio (Iguvium). In the 3rd century BC, Terni was conquered by the Romans and soon became an important &quot;municipium&quot; lying on the Via Flaminia and known under the name &quot;Interamna&quot;, meaning &quot;between-two-rivers&quot;.

In 271 BC the Roman consul Manius Curius Dentatus ordered the construction of a canal (the Curiano Trench) to divert the water from the marshes in the Rieti Valley and from Lake Velino over the natural cliff at Marmore, creating the waterfall. This caused flooding in the valley around Terni below. For a long time this became the cause of interminable quarrels between the cities of Rieti and Terni. The issue was so contentious between the two cities that the Roman Senate was forced to address it in 54 BC. Aulus Pompeius represented Terni, and Cicero represented Rieti. The Senate did nothing about the problem, and the problem remained the same for centuries.

After the Lombard conquest in 755, Terni lost prominence when it was reduced to a secondary town in the Duchy of Spoleto. In 1174, it was sacked by Frederick Barbarossa&#x27;s general, Archbishop Christian of Mainz. In the following century, Terni was one of the sites visited frequently by St. Francis to give sermons.

In the 14th century Terni issued its own constitution, and from 1353 the walls were enlarged, and new channels were opened. As with many of the Italian communes of the Late Middle Ages, it was beset by civil unrest between the partisans of the Guelphs and Ghibellines, and later between the &quot;Nobili&quot; and &quot;Banderari&quot; (Terni&#x27;s bourgeoisie). It later joined the Papal States. In 1580, an ironwork, the Ferriera, was introduced to work the iron ore mined in Monteleone di Spoleto, starting the traditional industrial connotation of the city. In the 17th century, however, the population of Terni declined further due to plagues and famines.

In the 19th century, Terni took advantage of the Industrial Revolution and of plentiful water sources in the area. New industries included a steelworks, a foundry, as well as weapons, jute and wool factories. In 1927, Terni became capital of the province.

The presence of important industries made the city a favorite target for the Allied bombardments in World War II. On August 11, 1943, a raid by 44 USAAF bombers, which dropped 213 tons of bombs, devastated the city, killing 564 people. It was the first of the 57 airstrikes that destroyed or damaged 40% of Terni&#x27;s buildings and killed 1,018 civilians. Despite this, industrial environment increased quickly after the war.

==Climate==

==Economy==
The city has three important industrial hubs: the first one is the Stainless Steel Area, called AST (part of the group ThyssenKrupp) and is a wide area located in the east part of Terni. West of the town, there is a second industrial hub, known as &quot;Area Polymer&quot;, with four different chemical multinational industries. The third industrial hub is Italeaf, which controls TerniEnergia, a company listed on STAR segment of Borsa Italiana, that is active in the renewable energy sector, and promotes and develops technological start-ups in the cleantech sector.

==Transport==
Terni is connected with the A1 motorway, the European route E45 and National Road Flaminia by the &quot;RATO&quot;, a motorway junction.

Terni railway station is part of the Ancona–Orte railway, and is also a junction station for two secondary lines, the Terni–Sulmona railway (which links Terni with L&#x27;Aquila) and the Terni–Sansepolcro railway (&quot;FCU&quot;) (which serves Perugia). One of the most important national freight stations is located nearby.
The local urban and suburban transport service, ATC, runs 90 bus lines. In the north of the city (Colleluna zone), there are works in progress on the line from Perugia to enable it to be used as a Light rail line.

<doc id="54169" wikidata="Q114843" url="?curid=54169" title="Erie County, New York">
<text>Erie County is a county along the shore of Lake Erie in western New York State. As of the 2020 census, the population was 954,236. However, in the 2023 census, the Erie County population was 946,147. The county seat is Buffalo, which makes up about 28% of the county&#x27;s population. Both the county and Lake Erie were named for the regional Iroquoian language-speaking Erie tribe of Native Americans, who lived in the area before 1654. They were later pushed out by the more powerful Iroquoian nations tribes. The county is part of the Western New York region of the state.

Erie County, along with its northern neighbor Niagara County, makes up the Buffalo-Niagara Falls metropolitan area, the second largest in the State of New York behind New York City. The county&#x27;s southern part is known as the Southtowns. The county has seen one of the highest growth rates of any county in the State of New York from the 2010 to 2020 census, although, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, Erie County has faced some population decline. Due to the harsh economic hit many businesses dealt with, leaving them to either close down completely or move to a larger city.

==History==

When counties were established by the English colonial authorities in the Province of New York in 1683, present-day Erie County was inhabited by the Iroquois. Significant colonization by White Americans did not begin until after the United States had gained independence with the end of the American Revolutionary War in 1783. The U.S. forced the Iroquois to cede most of their lands, as many had been allies of the British during the conflict.

About 1800, the Holland Land Company, formed by American businessmen and their Dutch associates, extinguished aboriginal claims by purchasing the land from New York, acquired the title to the territory of what are today the eight westernmost counties of New York, surveyed their holdings, established towns and began selling lots to individuals. The state was eager to attract settlers and have homesteads and businesses developed. At this time, all of western New York was included in Ontario County.

As the population increased, the state legislature created Genesee County in 1802 out of part of Ontario County. In 1808, Niagara County was created out of Genesee County. In 1821, Erie County was created out of Niagara County, encompassing all the land between Tonawanda Creek and Cattaraugus Creek. The first towns formed in present-day Erie County were the Town of Clarence and the Town of Willink. Clarence and Willink comprised the northern and southern portions of Erie county, respectively. Clarence is still a distinct town, but Willink was quickly subdivided into other towns. When Erie County was established in 1821, it consisted of the towns of Amherst, Aurora, Boston, Clarence, Collins, Concord, Eden, Evans, Hamburg, Holland, Sardinia and Wales.

The county has a number of houses and other properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places listings in Erie County, New York.

In 1861, the hamlet of Town Line in the Town of Lancaster voted 85–40 to secede from the Union. Town Line never sought admission into the Confederate States of America and there is no evidence that men from the community ever fought for the Confederacy. Some reporting from that time indicates the vote was a joke. On January 24, 1946, as part of a nationally reported event, Town Line voted to officially return to the Union after 85 years of Union secession.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which (85%) is land and (15%) is water.

Erie County is in the western portion of upstate New York, bordering on the lake of the same name. Part of the industrial area that has included Buffalo, it is the most populous county in upstate New York outside of the New York City metropolitan area. The county also lies on the international border between the United States and Canada, bordering the Province of Ontario.

The northern border of the county is Tonawanda Creek. Part of the southern border is Cattaraugus Creek. Other major streams include Buffalo Creek (Buffalo River), Cayuga Creek, Cazenovia Creek, Scajaquada Creek, Eighteen Mile Creek and Ellicott Creek. The county&#x27;s northern half, including Buffalo and its suburbs, is known as the Northtowns and is relatively flat and rises gently up from the lake. The southern half, known as the Southtowns, is much hillier. It has the northwesternmost foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. The highest elevation in the county is a hill in the Town of Sardinia that tops out at around above sea level. The lowest ground is about , on Grand Island at the Niagara River. The Onondaga Escarpment runs through the northern part of Erie County.

==County government and politics==
Prior to 1936, Erie County predominantly backed Republican Party candidates, with only four Democratic Party candidates winning the county in a presidential election - James Buchanan in 1856, George B. McClellan in 1864, Grover Cleveland in 1892 and Woodrow Wilson in 1912. However, starting with the 1936 election, it has turned predominantly Democratic since then, with only two Republicans carrying the county in a presidential election-- Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952 and 1956 and Richard Nixon in 1972, with Nixon being the most recent. In 2016, like many other counties in the Rust Belt, Donald Trump expanded the Republican vote share thanks to his appeal to working-class whites and Ethnic-Catholic voters, keeping the margin in single digits for the first time since 1984. Four years later, in 2020, Joe Biden won 267,270 votes in Erie County, more than Barack Obama in 2008. Biden&#x27;s margin of victory, however, was smaller than Obama&#x27;s 2008 victory within the county and Trump&#x27;s margin, though declining, was still higher than any Republican since 1988 (aside from his 2016 margin).

==Attractions and recreation==
Erie County is home to three professional teams—the NFL&#x27;s Buffalo Bills, the NHL&#x27;s Buffalo Sabres and the NLL&#x27;s Buffalo Bandits, along with Division I&#x27;s Buffalo Bulls and MILB&#x27;s Buffalo Bisons. The city of Buffalo also features the Buffalo Zoo, The Buffalo History Museum, Burchfield-Penney Art Center and Albright-Knox Art Gallery (all located within a mile of each other in the Delaware Park System), Buffalo and Erie County Botanical Gardens and Buffalo Museum of Science, the Frank Lloyd Wright&#x27;s Martin House Complex in addition to tourist districts such as Canalside and Larkinville. The Erie County Fair, held every August in the Town of Hamburg from 1820 to 2024 (the 2020 event, like much everything else across the country, was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic), is one of the largest county fairs in the United States.

===Erie County Department of Parks, Recreation and Forestry===
The Erie County Department of Parks, Recreation and Forestry was established in 1925 with four parks spanning . As of 2003, the county managed 38 properties, totaling approximately of land. Management objectives include providing and maintaining recreational space and the conservation of the county&#x27;s natural and historic resources. A 2003 Master Plan identified several broad categories of parks operated by the county, including heritage parks, waterfront parks, conservation parks, special purpose parks and forest management areas.

====Heritage parks====
Erie County&#x27;s heritage parks include the five original county parks that were established during the 1920s and 1930s. These parks are examples of multiple-use sites with significant scenic, natural and historic features. Each park has unique man-made structures of historical character, many constructed as part of the Works Progress Administration movement in the 1930s.

* Akron Falls Park (established in 1933, acquired by Erie County in 1947)
* Chestnut Ridge Park (established by Erie County in 1926)
* Como Lake Park (established in 1923, acquired by Erie County in 1926)
* Ellicott Creek Park (established by Erie County in 1926)
* Emery Park (established by Erie County in 1925)

====Waterfront parks====
Waterfront parks include the significant scenic sites and recreational trail systems along the county&#x27;s Lake Erie shoreline.
* Bennett Beach Park
* Isle View Park
* Riverwalk Park
* Wendt Beach Park

====Conservation parks====
These largely-undeveloped parks are managed primarily for conservation of the natural environment and passive nature-based outdoor recreation activities. These lands are intended to generally remain in a natural state.
* Boston Forest
* Eighteen Mile Creek Park
* Franklin Gulf Park
* Scoby Dam Park
* Sgt. Mark A. Rademacher Memorial Park (commonly known as Hunters Creek Park)

====Special purpose parks====
Special purpose parks have unique characteristics that provide specific recreational functions within the county&#x27;s park system.
* Buffalo and Erie County Botanical Gardens
* Elma Meadows Golf Course
* Grover Cleveland Golf Course
* Sprague Brook Park

====Forest management areas====
Forest management areas are managed by the Erie County Bureau of Forestry, which was established in 1927. These areas include several thousand acres of mostly-coniferous plantation style forest, much of which was planted on abandoned farmland by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s. These areas are located mostly in the rural southern portion of the county. These lands have limited recreation potential, mostly in the form of trails. Management of these lands is focused on natural resource conservation, in addition to potential commercial resource extraction of timber products or maple syrup.

<text>The LaserWriter is a laser printer with built-in PostScript interpreter sold by Apple, Inc. from 1985 to 1988. It was one of the first laser printers available to the mass market. In combination with WYSIWYG publishing software like PageMaker that operated on top of the graphical user interface of Macintosh computers, the LaserWriter was a key component at the beginning of the desktop publishing revolution.

==History==

===Development of laser printing===

Laser printing traces its history to efforts by Gary Starkweather at Xerox in 1969, which resulted in a commercial system called the Xerox 9700. IBM followed this with the IBM 3800 system in 1976. Both machines were large, room-filling devices handling the combined output of many users. During the mid-1970s, Canon started working on similar machines, and partnered with Hewlett-Packard to produce 1980&#x27;s HP 2680, which filled only part of a room. Other copier companies also started development of similar systems.

HP introduced their first desktop model with a Ricoh engine for $12,800 in 1983. Sales of the non-networked product were unsurprisingly poor. In 1983, Canon introduced the LBP-CX, a desktop laser printer engine using a laser diode and featuring an output resolution of 300 dpi. In 1984, HP released the first commercially available system based on the LBP-CX, the HP LaserJet.

===Apple&#x27;s development===
By 1982 Apple Computer was rumored to be developing laser printers. Steve Jobs of Apple had seen the LBP-CX while negotiating for supplies of 3.5&quot; floppy disk drives for the upcoming Apple Macintosh computer. Meanwhile, John Warnock had left Xerox to found Adobe Systems to commercialize PostScript and AppleTalk in a laser printer they intended to market. Jobs was aware of Warnock&#x27;s efforts, and upon his return to California he began convincing Warnock to allow Apple to license PostScript for a new printer that Apple would sell. Negotiations between Apple and Adobe over the use of PostScript began in 1983 and an agreement was reached in December 1983, one month before Macintosh was announced. Jobs eventually arranged for Apple to buy $2.5 million in Adobe stock.

At about the same time, Jonathan Seybold (John W. Seybold&#x27;s son) introduced Paul Brainerd to Apple, where he learned of Apple&#x27;s laser printer efforts and saw the potential for a new program using the Mac&#x27;s GUI to produce PostScript output for the new printer. Arranging his own funding through a venture capital firm, Brainerd formed Aldus and began development of what would become PageMaker. The venture capital coined the term &quot;desktop publishing&quot; during this time.

===Release===
The LaserWriter was announced at Apple&#x27;s annual shareholder meeting on January 23, 1985, the same day Aldus announced PageMaker. Shipments began in March 1985 at the retail price of US$6,995, significantly more than the HP model. However, the LaserWriter featured AppleTalk support that allowed the printer to be shared among as many as sixteen Macs, meaning that its per-user price could fall to under $450, far less expensive than HP&#x27;s less-advanced model.

The combination of the LaserWriter, PostScript, PageMaker and the Mac&#x27;s GUI and built-in AppleTalk networking would ultimately transform the landscape of computer desktop publishing. At the time, Apple planned to release a suite of AppleTalk products as part of the Macintosh Office, with the LaserWriter being only the first component.

While competing printers and their associated control languages offered some of the capabilities of PostScript, they were limited in their ability to reproduce free-form layouts (as a desktop publishing application might produce), use outline fonts, or offer the level of detail and control over the page layout. HP&#x27;s own LaserJet was driven by a simple page description language, known as Printer Command Language, or PCL. The version for the LaserJet, PCL4, was adapted from earlier inkjet printers with the addition of downloadable bitmapped fonts. It lacked the power and flexibility of PostScript until several upgrades provided some level of parity. It was some time before similar products became available on other platforms, by which time the Mac had ridden the desktop publishing market to success.

The LaserWriter contained four built-in PostScript font families: Times, Helvetica, Courier, and Symbol. These fonts became very popular as a result, being used a lot in desktop publishing.

==Description==

===Hardware===
The LaserWriter used the same Canon CX printing engine as the HP LaserJet, and as a consequence early LaserWriters and LaserJets shared the same toner cartridges and paper trays. PostScript is a complete programming language that has to be run in a suitable interpreter and then sent to a software rasterizer program, all inside the printer. To support this, the LaserWriter featured a Motorola 68000 CPU running at 12 MHz, 512 KB of workspace RAM, and a 1 MB frame buffer.

At introduction, the LaserWriter had the most processing power in Apple&#x27;s product line—more than the 8 MHz Macintosh. As a result, the LaserWriter was also one of Apple&#x27;s most expensive offerings. For implementation purposes, the LaserWriter employed a small number of medium-scale-integration Monolithic Memories PALs, and no custom LSI, whereas the LaserJet employed a large number of small-scale-integration Texas Instruments 74-Series gates, and one custom LSI. The LaserWriter was, thereby, in the same form factor (for its RIP), able to provide much greater function, and, indeed, much greater performance, all within the very same LBP-CX form factor, although the external packaging was, for marketing purposes, somewhat different.

===Networking===
Since the cost of a LaserWriter was several times that of a dot-matrix impact printer, some means to share the printer with several Macs was desired. LANs were complex and expensive, so Apple developed its own networking scheme, LocalTalk. Based on the AppleTalk protocol stack, LocalTalk connected the LaserWriter to the Mac over an RS-422 serial port. At 230.4 kbit/s LocalTalk was slower than the Centronics PC parallel interface, but allowed several computers to share a single LaserWriter. PostScript enabled the LaserWriter to print complex pages containing high-resolution bitmap graphics, outline fonts, and vector illustrations. The LaserWriter could print more complex layouts than the HP LaserJet and other non-Postscript printers. Paired with the program Aldus PageMaker, the LaserWriter gave the layout editor an exact replica of the printed page. The LaserWriter offered a generally faithful proofing tool for preparing documents for quantity publication, and could print smaller quantities directly. The Mac platform quickly gained the favor of the emerging desktop-publishing industry, a market in which the Mac is still important.

===Design===
The LaserWriter was the first major printer designed by Apple to use the new Snow White design language created by Frog Design. It also continued a departure from the beige color that characterized the Apple and Macintosh products to that time by using the same brighter, creamy off-white color first introduced with the Apple IIc and Apple Scribe Printer 8 months earlier. In that regard it and its successors stood out among all of Apple&#x27;s Macintosh product offerings until 1987, when Apple adopted a unifying warm gray color they called Platinum across its entire product line, which was to last for over a decade.

The LaserWriter was also the first peripheral to use the LocalTalk connector and Apple&#x27;s unified round AppleTalk Connector Family, which allowed any variety of mechanical networking systems to be plugged into the ports on the computers or printers. A common solution was the 3rd party PhoneNET which used conventional telephone cables for networking.

===Legacy===
Apple&#x27;s RIP was of its own design, and was implemented using few ICs, including PALs for most combinatorial logic; with the subsystem timing DRAM refreshing, and rasterization functions being implemented in very few medium-scale-integration PALs. Apple&#x27;s competitors (i.e., QMS, NEC, and others) generally used a variation of one of Adobe&#x27;s RIPs with their large quantity of small-scale-integration (i.e., Texas Instruments&#x27; 7400 series) ICs.

In the same time-frame as Apple&#x27;s LaserWriter, Adobe was licensing the very same version of PostScript to Apple&#x27;s potential competitors (Apple&#x27;s PostScript licensing terms were non-exclusive); however, all non-Apple licensees of PostScript generally employed one of Adobe&#x27;s PostScript &quot;reference models&quot; (Atlas, Redstone, etc.) and even Linotype&#x27;s first image setter which featured PostScript employed such a &quot;reference model&quot; (but with customization for the Linotronic&#x27;s different video interface, plus the necessary implementation of &quot;banding&quot; and a hard drive frame buffer and font storage mechanism). Indeed, the PostScript language itself was concurrently enhanced and extended to support these high-resolution &quot;banding&quot; devices (as contrasted to the lower resolution &quot;framing&quot; devices, such as the LaserWriter, in which the entire &quot;frame&quot; could be contained within the available RAM).

In most cases, such RAM was fixed in size and was soldered to the logic board. In late PostScript Level 1, and in early PostScript Level 2, the RAM size was made variable and was generally extensible, through plug-in SIMMs, beyond the 2.0 to 2.5 MB minimum (0.5 to 1.0 MB for instructions, depending upon PostScript version, and 1.5 MB minimum for the &quot;frame buffer&quot;, for the lowest resolution devices, 300 dpi), as more than 300 dpi of course required more RAM, and some LaserWriters were able to change between 300 dpi and 600 dpi, depending upon how much RAM was installed. 600 dpi, for example, required 6 MB of RAM, but 8 MB of RAM was more commonly found.

At this point, Apple&#x27;s LaserWriters were employing generic non-parity RAM, whereas HP&#x27;s LaserJets, especially the ones which offered a plug-in PostScript interpreter card, required special parity-type PS/2 RAM modules with a &quot;presence detect&quot; function according to IBM specs.

==Other LaserWriter models==
Building on the success of the original LaserWriter, Apple developed many further models. Later LaserWriters offered faster printing, higher resolutions, Ethernet connectivity, and eventually color output in the Color LaserWriter. To compete, many other laser printer manufacturers licensed Adobe PostScript for inclusion into their own models. Eventually the standardization on Ethernet for connectivity and the ubiquity of PostScript undermined the unique position of Apple&#x27;s printers: Macintosh computers functioned equally well with any Postscript printer. After the LaserWriter 8500, Apple discontinued the LaserWriter product line in 1997 when Steve Jobs returned to Apple.

=== LaserWriter II ===

In 1988, to address the need for both an affordable printer and a professional printer, the LaserWriter II was designed to allow for complete replacement of the computer circuit board that operates the printer. Across all the different models, the print engine was the same.
* For low-end users, there was the LaserWriter IISC, a host-based QuickDraw printer connected via SCSI that did not use PostScript and did not require a license from Adobe. It had two SCSI ports to allow daisy-chaining of the printer with other SCSI devices such as hard drives. It did not support AppleTalk.
* For midrange users, the LaserWriter IINT provided PostScript support and AppleTalk networking.
* For high-end users, the LaserWriter IINTX also included a SCSI controller for storage of printer fonts on a hard drive dedicated for use by the printer.

Three years later in 1991, two updated versions of the LaserWriter II were produced.
* The LaserWriter IIf had a faster processor than the IINTX, a newer version of PostScript and also HP PCL, and included the SCSI interface for font storage on an external hard drive.
* The LaserWriter IIg had the capabilities of the IIf, and was also the first LaserWriter with a built-in Ethernet network interface.

To deliver higher performance, Apple eventually switched from the 68000 series to the Am29000 series of processors to drive later models, starting with the Personal LaserWriter NTR in 1992.

<text>Pulp Fiction is a 1994 American independent crime film written and directed by Quentin Tarantino from a story he conceived with Roger Avary. It tells four intertwining tales of crime and violence in Los Angeles. The film stars John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis, Tim Roth, Ving Rhames, and Uma Thurman. The title refers to the pulp magazines and hardboiled crime novels popular during the mid-20th century, known for their graphic violence and punchy dialogue.

Tarantino wrote &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; in 1992 and 1993, incorporating scenes that Avary originally wrote for &quot;True Romance&quot; (1993). Its plot occurs out of chronological order. The film is also self-referential from its opening moments, beginning with a title card that gives two dictionary definitions of &quot;pulp&quot;. Considerable screen time is devoted to monologues and casual conversations with eclectic dialogue revealing each character&#x27;s perspectives on several subjects, and the film features an ironic combination of humor and strong violence. TriStar Pictures reportedly turned down the script as &quot;too demented&quot;. Miramax Films co-chairman Harvey Weinstein was enthralled, however, and the film became the first that Miramax Films fully financed.

&quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; won the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 1994 Cannes Film Festival and was a major critical and commercial success. It was nominated for seven awards at the 67th Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and won Best Original Screenplay; Travolta, Jackson, and Thurman were nominated for Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, and Best Supporting Actress respectively. As a result of the film&#x27;s success, Travolta&#x27;s career was reinvigorated. The film&#x27;s development, marketing, distribution, and profitability had a sweeping effect on independent cinema.

&quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; is widely regarded as Tarantino&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus&quot;, with particular praise for its screenwriting. The self-reflexivity, unconventional structure, and extensive homage and pastiche have led critics to describe it as a touchstone of postmodern film. It is often considered a cultural watershed, influencing films and other media that adopted elements of its style. The cast was also widely praised, with Travolta, Thurman, and Jackson earning high acclaim. In 2008, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; named it the best film since 1983 and it has appeared on many critics&#x27; lists of the greatest films ever made. In 2013, &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

== Plot ==

=== Narrative structure ===
&quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;″s narrative is told out of chronological order and follows three main interrelated stories that each have a different protagonist: Vincent Vega, a hitman; Butch Coolidge, a prizefighter; and Jules Winnfield, Vincent&#x27;s partner in crime.

The film begins with a diner robbery staged by a couple, then begins to shift from one story line to another before returning to the diner for the conclusion. There are seven narrative sequences; the three primary story lines are preceded by intertitles:

# &quot;Prologue – The Diner&quot; (i)
# &quot;Prelude to &#x27;Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace&#x27;s Wife&#x27;&quot;
# &quot;Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace&#x27;s Wife&quot;
# &quot;Prelude to &#x27;The Gold Watch&#x27;&quot; (a – flashback, b – present)
# &quot;The Gold Watch&quot;
# &quot;The Bonnie Situation&quot;
# &quot;Epilogue – The Diner&quot; (ii)

If the seven sequences were ordered chronologically, they would run: 4a, 2, 6, 1, 7, 3, 4b, 5. Sequences 1 and 7 partially overlap and are presented from different points of view, as do sequences 2 and 6. According to Philip Parker, the structural form is &quot;an episodic narrative with circular events adding a beginning and end and allowing references to elements of each separate episode to be made throughout the narrative&quot;. Other analysts describe the structure as a &quot;circular narrative&quot;.

=== Summary ===
A pair of thieves, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny, reminisce on their past robbery attempts as they eat breakfast in a diner. Pumpkin proposes they rob the diner at that moment because he believes the patrons and employees will be unprepared to stop them. Honey Bunny agrees.

Two hitmen, Jules Winnfield and Vincent Vega, arrive at an apartment to retrieve a briefcase for their boss, influential local gangster Marsellus Wallace, from a business partner, Brett, and his friends. On the way, Vincent mentions that he had been tasked by Marcellus to take his wife, Mia Wallace to dinner and asks Jules questions about Mia. After Vincent checks the contents of the briefcase, Jules shoots one of Brett&#x27;s friends. Jules rebukes Brett over his attempt to double-cross Marsellus and recites what is portrayed as a passage from the Book of Ezekiel, before he and Vincent kill Brett.

==== &quot;Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace&#x27;s Wife&quot; ====
Jules and Vincent give the briefcase to Marsellus, who bribes boxer Butch Coolidge to take a dive in his upcoming match. Vincent purchases heroin from his drug dealer, Lance. He shoots up and drives to meet Mia, having agreed to escort her while Marsellus is out of town for the night. They eat at a 1950s-themed restaurant and participate in a twist contest, then return home. While Vincent is in the bathroom, Mia finds his heroin, mistakes it for cocaine, and snorts it, resulting in an overdose. Vincent rushes her to Lance&#x27;s house, where Lance helps revive her by getting adrenaline for Vincent to inject into her heart. Vincent takes Mia home, and they agree never to tell Marsellus about the incident.

==== &quot;The Gold Watch&quot; ====
Butch double-crosses Marsellus by winning the bout, but accidentally kills his opponent in the process. He plans to flee with his girlfriend, Fabienne, but discovers she has forgotten to pack an heirloom: a gold watch which belonged to Butch&#x27;s father. Returning to his apartment to retrieve it, he notices a gun on the kitchen counter and hears the toilet flush. When Vincent exits the bathroom, Butch realizes he is there to kill him, shoots him dead and departs.

When Marsellus spots Butch stopped at a traffic light, Butch rams his car into him. Marsellus chases him into a pawnshop. Maynard, the shop owner, captures them at gunpoint and binds and gags them in the basement. Maynard and his accomplice, Zed, take Marsellus into another room and begin to rape him. Butch breaks free and is about to escape, but decides to save Marsellus and arms himself with a katana from the pawnshop. He kills Maynard and frees Marsellus, who shoots Zed in the crotch with Maynard&#x27;s shotgun. Marsellus tells Butch that they are even, and instructs him to tell no one about the incident and depart Los Angeles forever. Butch picks up Fabienne on Zed&#x27;s chopper and they drive away.

==== &quot;The Bonnie Situation&quot; ====
In the apartment, after Jules and Vincent kill Brett, another man bursts out of the bathroom and fires at them. Every shot misses and they shoot him dead. Jules says that their survival was a miracle, which Vincent disputes, believing the man was just a lousy shot. While driving away with another one of Brett&#x27;s friends, Marvin (who was actually a plant from Marsellus&#x27;s organization), Vincent accidentally shoots him in the head after Jules drives over an unidentified inconsistency in the roadbed, covering Vincent, Jules, and the car interior in blood. They hide the car at the home of Jules&#x27;s old friend and former business partner Jimmie, who demands they deal with the problem before his wife Bonnie comes home. Marsellus sends a cleaner, Winston Wolfe, who directs Jules and Vincent to hide the body in the trunk, clean the car, dispose of their bloody clothes and take the car to a junkyard.

At the diner from the film&#x27;s prologue, Jules tells Vincent that he plans to retire from his life of crime, convinced that their survival at the apartment was divine intervention. While Vincent is in the bathroom, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny hold up the restaurant and demand Marsellus&#x27;s briefcase. Pumpkin initially holds Jules at gunpoint, but Jules soon overpowers Pumpkin and holds him at gunpoint. Honey Bunny becomes hysterical and points her gun at Jules. Vincent returns with his gun aimed at her, but Jules defuses the situation. He recites the biblical passage, expresses ambivalence about his life of crime, and allows the robbers to take his cash and leave. Jules and Vincent leave the diner with the briefcase.

== Cast ==

* John Travolta as Vincent Vega:
:Jules&#x27; partner-in-crime, working for Marsellus Wallace. Tarantino cast Travolta in &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; because Michael Madsen, who had played Vic Vega in &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; (1992), chose to appear in Kevin Costner&#x27;s &quot;Wyatt Earp&quot; instead. Madsen has since expressed regret over his decision. Harvey Weinstein pushed for Daniel Day-Lewis in the part. Travolta accepted a reduced rate; sources say either US$100,000 or US$140,000. The film&#x27;s success and his Academy Award nomination for Best Actor revitalized his career. Vincent is the brother of Vic Vega, also known as Mr. Blonde in &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot;, and in 2004, Tarantino discussed an idea for a movie starring Travolta and Madsen as the &quot;Vega Brothers&quot;; the concept remains unrealized.
* Samuel L. Jackson as Jules Winnfield:
:Vincent&#x27;s partner in crime, working for Marsellus Wallace. Jackson&#x27;s first audition was overshadowed by Paul Calderón; Jackson had assumed the audition was merely a reading. Weinstein convinced him to audition a second time and his performance of the final diner scene won over Tarantino. Jules was originally scripted with a giant afro, but Tarantino&#x27;s PA mistakenly bought a Jheri curled wig. Tarantino was enraged but Jackson persuaded him to keep it since the hairstyle had gained popularity through the rap group N.W.A. Film critic Owen Gleiberman took it as a &quot;tacit comic statement about the ghettoization of [Black people] in movies&quot;. Jackson received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Calderón appears in the film as Paul, a bartender at Marsellus&#x27;s social club, as well as Marsellus&#x27;s assistant. Tarantino wrote the role for Laurence Fishburne, who turned it down. According to Tarantino, Fishburne refused it because his team did not see it as a starring role; Fishburne later said he turned it down because he felt the film glamorized heroin.
* Uma Thurman as Mia Wallace:
:Wallace&#x27;s wife and an aspiring actress. Miramax favored Holly Hunter or Meg Ryan for the role of Mia. Alfre Woodard and Meg Tilly were also considered but Tarantino wanted Thurman after their first meeting. She dominated the film&#x27;s promotional material, appearing on a bed with cigarette in hand. She was nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. Despite being launched into the celebrity A-list, Thurman chose not to do any big-budget films until &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; (1997) three years later.
* Harvey Keitel as Winston Wolfe:
:A &quot;cleaner&quot; who aids Jules and Vincent. Tarantino wrote the part of Wolfe for Keitel, who had starred in &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; and was instrumental in its production. In Tarantino&#x27;s words, &quot;Harvey had been my favorite actor since I was 16 years old.&quot; Keitel had played a similarly employed character in &quot;Point of No Return&quot; (1993).
* Tim Roth as Ringo/&quot;Pumpkin&quot;:
:A burglar and Yolanda&#x27;s boyfriend. Roth had starred in &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; alongside Keitel. He had used an American accent in &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; but used his natural, London accent in &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;. Though Tarantino had written the part with Roth in mind, TriStar head Mike Medavoy preferred Johnny Depp or Christian Slater. Early in development, Tarantino had contemplated casting Roth as Vincent and Gary Oldman as Jules, rewriting the characters as &quot;two English guys&quot;.
* Amanda Plummer as Yolanda/&quot;Honey Bunny&quot;:
:Ringo&#x27;s girlfriend and partner in crime. Tarantino wrote the role of Yolanda for Plummer to partner her with Roth. Roth had introduced Tarantino to her, saying: &quot;I want to work with Amanda in one of your films but she has to have a really big gun.&quot;
* Maria de Medeiros as Fabienne:
:Butch&#x27;s girlfriend. Tarantino met de Medeiros, a Portuguese actress, while traveling with &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; around the European film festival circuit.
* Ving Rhames as Marsellus Wallace:
:A crime boss and employer of Jules and Vincent. Before Rhames was cast, the part of Wallace was initially offered to Max Julien and Sid Haig, but both turned down the role. According to Bender, Rhames gave &quot;one of the best auditions I&#x27;ve ever seen&quot;. His acclaimed performance led to him being cast in big-budget features such as &quot;&quot; (1996), &quot;Con Air&quot; (1997) and &quot;Out of Sight&quot; (1998).
* Eric Stoltz as Lance:
:Vincent&#x27;s drug dealer. Gary Oldman was the preferred choice among TriStar executives, based on his portrayal of drug-dealing pimp Drexl Spivey in &quot;True Romance&quot; (1993).
* Rosanna Arquette as Jody:
:Lance&#x27;s wife. Pam Grier read for the role, but Tarantino did not believe audiences would find it plausible for Lance to yell at her. Tarantino later cast Grier as the lead role for &quot;Jackie Brown&quot;. Ellen DeGeneres also read for the part of Jody. Rosanna&#x27;s sister Alexis (then known as Robert Arquette) also appears in the film, as a man emerging from a bathroom to shoot at and miss Vincent and Jules who then kill him.
* Christopher Walken as Captain Koons:
:A USAF veteran of the Vietnam War who delivers a young Butch his father&#x27;s coveted gold watch. During Koons&#x27; monologue, which is interspersed with colorful descriptions of the Viet Cong, he mentions a soldier called &quot;Winocki&quot;. Joe Winocki (John Garfield) is a character in the 1943 film &quot;Air Force&quot; directed by Howard Hawks, one of Tarantino&#x27;s favorite directors. Tarantino played a character named Desmond Winocki in a guest appearance on an episode of &quot;All-American Girl&quot; titled &quot;Pulp Sitcom&quot;.
* Bruce Willis as Butch Coolidge:
:An aging boxer on the run from Marsellus after having double-crossed him. The role was originally written for Matt Dillon who turned it down. Willis was already a star but most of his recent films had been critical and box-office disappointments. As related by Peter Bart, participating in the modestly budgeted film &quot;meant lowering his salary and risking his star status but the strategy ... paid off royally: &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; not only brought Willis new respect as an actor but also earned him several million dollars&quot;. Willis&#x27; appearance and physical presence were crucial to Tarantino, &quot;Bruce has the look of a 50s actor. I can&#x27;t think of any other star that has that look&quot;. Butch&#x27;s look was modeled on Aldo Ray in &quot;Nightfall&quot; and his demeanor based on Ralph Meeker&#x27;s portrayal of Mike Hammer in Robert Aldrich&#x27;s &quot;Kiss Me Deadly&quot;. Chandler Lindauer plays a young Butch.

Bronagh Gallagher plays Jody&#x27;s friend Trudi who does little but smoke a bong during the scene where Vincent revives Mia. According to author Jason Bailey, &quot;Quentin thought it would be funny to have this casual observer who just happened to be there. All of this was born out of the experience of, when you go to someone&#x27;s house to buy drugs, there are always people who are just there&quot;. Phil LaMarr portrays Marvin, an associate of Jules and Vincent. LaMarr auditioned for Tarantino after both had done a show for an improv group a few months prior. He read for the roles of Jules Winnfield and Brett before being cast as Marvin. Tarantino appears as Jules&#x27; friend Jimmie, in whose house they clean up a murder. Tarantino was unsure whether to play Jimmie or Lance, choosing Jimmie as he wanted to be behind the camera during Mia&#x27;s overdose scene.

Frank Whaley portrays Brett, who has a briefcase requested by Marsellus. Whaley met Tarantino while he was filming &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; at a lab in Sundance Institute. He recalls, &quot;we ended up meeting and spending time together, and I liked him, so I was really happy when he asked me to be in this movie.&quot; Burr Steers appears as Roger, a friend of Brett&#x27;s nicknamed &quot;Flock of Seagulls&quot; by Jules. The scene of the confrontation between Brett and Jules went through several takes due to Steers making mistakes. Steers recalled in an interview that he had found acting difficult due to the loudness of the gunshots.

Angela Jones portrays Esmarelda Villalobos, a cab driver who aids Butch&#x27;s escape. Her casting and character were inspired by her performance in the 1991 short film &quot;Curdled&quot;, later remade as a 1996 feature film with finance from Tarantino and again starring Jones. Duane Whitaker, Peter Greene and Stephen Hibbert play Maynard, Zed and the gimp. According to &quot;The Daily Beast&quot;, these &quot;three psycho hillbillies&quot; that rape Marsellus in Maynard&#x27;s shop&#x27;s basement allude to the film &quot;Deliverance&quot;. Steve Buscemi makes a cameo appearance as a waiter at Jack Rabbit Slim&#x27;s, dressed as Buddy Holly. Buscemi, who had appeared in &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot;, was originally considered for the role of Jimmie but was unable to commit. Kathy Griffin appears as herself. Michael Gilden and Joseph Pilato also appear at Jack Rabbit Slim&#x27;s as waiter Phillip Morris Page and a Dean Martin impersonator, respectively. Emil Sitka made a cameo via archival footage from the &quot;Three Stooges&quot; short &quot;Brideless Groom&quot; (1947), Karen Maruyama appears as &quot;Gawker #1&quot; after Butch&#x27;s car accident, and Julia Sweeney portrays Raquel, the daughter of the owner of the junkyard in which Marvin&#x27;s body is disposed of. Producer Lawrence Bender makes a cameo as a victim of the diner robbery, credited as &quot;Long Hair Yuppie-Scum&quot;. Jerome Patrick Hoban appears in the Jack Rabbit Slim&#x27;s segment as an Ed Sullivan impersonator. Susan Griffiths appears alongside Hoban as a Marilyn Monroe impersonator.

== Production ==

=== Writing ===

The roots of &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; can be traced back to the late 1980s, when Tarantino and Roger Avary worked together at Video Archives, a video store in Southern California. Avary recalls that their initial concept was to create three short films with three different filmmakers—himself, Tarantino, and a friend, Adam Rifkin. Avary wrote the first element of what would become the film&#x27;s screenplay in the fall of 1990, titled &quot;Pandemonium Reigns,&quot; which eventually expanded into a feature-length screenplay. While Tarantino&#x27;s short film similarly evolved into a full script, Rifkin never completed his contribution, leaving &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; initially uncertain. The initial inspiration was the three-part horror anthology film &quot;Black Sabbath&quot; (1963), by Italian filmmaker Mario Bava. The Tarantino–Avary project was provisionally titled &quot;Black Mask&quot;, after the seminal hardboiled crime fiction magazine. Tarantino&#x27;s script was produced as &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot;, his directorial debut; Avary created the basis for the &quot;Gold Watch&quot; storyline of &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;.

With work on &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; completed, Tarantino returned to the notion of a trilogy film: &quot;I got the idea of doing something that novelists get a chance to do but filmmakers don&#x27;t: telling three separate stories, having characters float in and out with different weights depending on the story.&quot; Tarantino explains that the idea &quot;was basically to take like the oldest chestnuts that you&#x27;ve ever seen when it comes to crime stories – the oldest stories in the book ... You know, &#x27;Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace&#x27;s Wife&#x27; – the oldest story about ... the guy&#x27;s gotta go out with the big man&#x27;s wife and don&#x27;t touch her. You know, you&#x27;ve seen the story a zillion times.&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m using old forms of storytelling and then purposely having them run awry&quot;, he says. &quot;Part of the trick is to take these movie characters, these genre characters and these genre situations and actually apply them to some of real life&#x27;s rules and see how they unravel.&quot; In at least one case, boxer Butch Coolidge, Tarantino had in mind a specific character from a classic Hollywood crime story: &quot;I wanted him to be basically like Ralph Meeker as Mike Hammer in Aldrich&#x27;s &quot;Kiss Me Deadly&quot; [1955]. I wanted him to be a bully and a jerk&quot;.

Tarantino went to work on the script for &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; in Amsterdam in March 1992, possibly at the Winston Hotel in the Red Light District. He was joined there by Avary, who contributed &quot;Pandemonium Reigns&quot; to the project and participated in its rewriting as well as the development of the new storylines that would link up with it. Two scenes originally written by Avary for the &quot;True Romance&quot; screenplay, exclusively credited to Tarantino, were incorporated into the opening of &quot;The Bonnie Situation&quot;: the &quot;miraculous&quot; missed shots by the hidden gunman and the rear seat automobile killing. The notion of the crimeworld &quot;cleaner&quot; that became the heart of the episode was inspired by a short, &quot;Curdled&quot;, that Tarantino saw at a film festival. He cast the lead actress, Angela Jones, in &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; and later backed the filmmakers&#x27; production of a feature-length version of &quot;Curdled&quot;. The script included a couple of made-up commercial brands that often featured in later Tarantino films: Big Kahuna burgers (a Big Kahuna soda cup appears in &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot;) and Red Apple cigarettes. As he worked on the script, Tarantino also accompanied &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; around the European film festivals. Released in the United States in October 1992, the picture was a critical and commercial success. In January 1993, the &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; script was complete.

The adrenaline scene was inspired by the Martin Scorsese documentary &quot;American Boy: A Profile of Steven Prince&quot; about &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; actor Steven Prince, who played arms dealer Easy Andy in the film. Prince recalls injecting adrenaline into the heart of a woman who overdosed, with the help of a medical dictionary and a Magic Marker.

=== Financing ===
Tarantino and his producer, Lawrence Bender, brought the script to Jersey Films. Before even seeing &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot;, Jersey had attempted to sign Tarantino for his next project. Ultimately a development deal worth around $1 million had been struck: The deal gave A Band Apart, Bender and Tarantino&#x27;s newly formed production company, initial financing and office facilities; Jersey got a share of the project and the right to shop the script to a studio. Jersey had a distribution and &quot;first look&quot; deal with Columbia TriStar, which paid Tarantino for the right to consider exercising its option. In February, &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; appeared on a &quot;Variety&quot; list of films in pre-production at TriStar. In June, however, the studio put the script into turnaround. According to a studio executive, TriStar chief Mike Medavoy found it &quot;too demented&quot;. There were suggestions that TriStar was resistant to back a film featuring a heroin user; there were also indications that the studio simply saw the project as too low-budget for its desired star-driven image. Avarywho was about to start shooting his own directorial debut, &quot;Killing Zoe&quot;has said that TriStar&#x27;s objections were comprehensive, encompassing the script&#x27;s fundamental structure. He characterizes the studio&#x27;s position: This is the worst thing ever written. It makes no sense. Someone&#x27;s dead and then they&#x27;re alive. It&#x27;s too long, violent, and unfilmable.&#x27; ... So I thought, &#x27;That&#x27;s that!

Bender brought the script to Miramax Films, the formerly independent studio that had recently been acquired by Disney. Harvey Weinsteinco-chairman of Miramax Films, along with his brother Bobwas instantly enthralled by the script and the company picked it up. Michael Shamberg, the executive producer, reflected on the bidding process, saying, &quot;Only Harvey [Weinstein] placed a bid. Harvey believed he was engaged in a bidding war, but he wasn&#x27;t. Even now, whenever I see Bob Shaye, he expresses regret for turning down &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;. Quentin initially wanted to collaborate with Mike Medavoy, given Medavoy&#x27;s history with the great Orion films. Ironically, when the opportunity arose, Mike deemed the script too violent.&quot; &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, the first Miramax Films project to get a green light after the Disney acquisition, was budgeted at $8.5 million, and at the end $500,000 was returned, bringing the final budget to $8 million. According to Bender, a lower budget meant that the producers could maintain more control over the movie itself.
It became the first movie that Miramax Films completely financed. Helping hold costs down was the plan Bender executed to pay all the main actors the same amount per week, regardless of their industry status. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported, &quot;Most of the actors received relatively small salaries along with a percentage of the profits.&quot; The biggest star to sign on to the project was Bruce Willis. Though he had recently appeared in several big-budget flops, he was still a major overseas draw. On the strength of his name, Miramax Films garnered $11 million for the film&#x27;s worldwide rights, virtually ensuring its profitability.

=== Casting ===
Danny DeVito, one of the film&#x27;s producers, recalls that Weinstein suggested casting Daniel Day-Lewis, who had just won an Academy Award for &quot;My Left Foot&quot;. DeVito responded by stating that Tarantino wanted John Travolta and reminded Weinstein that he had final cut and cast approval. He later reflected: &quot;I think he [Weinstein] called me every name in the book, but of course, Quentin got what he wanted, and he was absolutely right, and the rest is history.&quot; 

Bender noted that during the casting process, while Samuel L. Jackson&#x27;s initial audition was impressive, another candidate later delivered a performance that &quot;blew them away.&quot; This prompted Bender to inform Jackson&#x27;s agent that they might need to consider the other actor. The agent firmly insisted, &quot;No, no, no, you can&#x27;t do that. Sam will come back.&quot; Initially hesitant to ask him for another audition, Bender discovered that Jackson believed he was simply reading for the role, not auditioning, and his subsequent return resulted in an outstanding performance.

Tim Roth, initially interested in the role meant for Willis, suggested Amanda Plummer as a co-star, insisting she should have a gun as he thought it would be &quot;terrifying&quot; - a notion Tarantino later incorporated into the script.

Harvey Keitel played a crucial role in getting &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; made and introduced Bruce Willis to Tarantino. Bender and Tarantino went to see him at his house in Malibu, where they learned that he could recite practically the entire movie of &quot;Reservoir Dogs,&quot; a movie he loved. After a conversation, Tarantino and Willis took a walk on the beach, where Willis revealed he&#x27;d read the &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; script and expressed interest in playing Vincent or Jules. Tarantino encouraged him to read the script one last time with the Butch character in mind. Willis called Tarantino the next day and said, &quot;the shortest sentence in the Bible is, &#x27;Jesus wept.&#x27; The shortest sentence in Hollywood is, &#x27;I&#x27;m in.&#x27;&quot;

Principal photography commenced on September 20, 1993. The lead offscreen talent had all worked with Tarantino on &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; – cinematographer Andrzej Sekuła, film editor Sally Menke, production designer David Wasco, and costume designer Betsy Heimann. According to Tarantino: &quot;[W]e had $8 million. I wanted it to look like a $20–25 million movie. I wanted it to look like an epic. It&#x27;s an epic in everything – in invention, in ambition, in length, in scope, in everything except the price tag.&quot; The film, he says, was shot &quot;on 50 ASA film stock, which is the slowest stock they make. The reason we use it is that it creates an almost no-grain image, it&#x27;s lustrous. It&#x27;s the closest thing we have to 50s Technicolor.&quot; The largest chunk of the budget – $150,000 – went to creating the Jack Rabbit Slim&#x27;s set. It was built in a Culver City warehouse, where it was joined by several other sets, as well as the film&#x27;s production offices. The diner sequence was shot on location in Hawthorne at the Hawthorne Grill, known for its Googie architecture. For the costumes, Tarantino took his inspiration from French director Jean-Pierre Melville, who believed that the clothes his characters wore were their symbolic suits of armor. Tarantino cast himself in a modest-sized role as he had in &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot;. One of his pop totems, Fruit Brute, a long-discontinued General Mills cereal, also returned from the earlier film. The shoot wrapped on November 30. Before &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;″s premiere, Tarantino convinced Avary to forfeit his agreed-on cowriting credit and accept a &quot;story by&quot; credit, so the line &quot;Written and directed by Quentin Tarantino&quot; could be used in advertising and onscreen.

== Music ==
No film score was composed for &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;; Quentin Tarantino instead used an eclectic assortment of surf music, rock and roll, soul, and pop songs. Dick Dale&#x27;s rendition of &quot;Misirlou&quot; plays during the opening credits. Tarantino chose surf music as the basic musical style for the film, but not, he insists, because of its association with surfing culture: &quot;To me it just sounds like rock and roll, even Morricone music. It sounds like rock and roll spaghetti Western music.&quot; Tarantino planned to use a power pop song, &quot;My Sharona&quot; by The Knack, during the film&#x27;s rape scene, but ultimately discounted it.

Some of the songs were suggested to Tarantino by his friends Chuck Kelley and Laura Lovelace, who were credited as music consultants. Lovelace also appeared in the film as Laura, a waitress; she reprises the role in &quot;Jackie Brown&quot;. The soundtrack album was released along with the film in 1994. The album peaked on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart at number 21. The single, Urge Overkill&#x27;s cover of the Neil Diamond song &quot;Girl, You&#x27;ll Be a Woman Soon&quot;, reached number 59.

Estella Tincknell describes how the particular combination of well-known and obscure recordings helps establish the film as a &quot;self-consciously &#x27;cool&#x27; text. [The] use of the mono-tracked, beat-heavy style of early 1960s U.S. &#x27;underground&#x27; pop mixed with &#x27;classic&#x27; ballads such as Dusty Springfield&#x27;s &#x27;Son of a Preacher Man&#x27; is crucial to the film&#x27;s postmodern knowingness.&quot; She contrasts the soundtrack with that of &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;, the highest-grossing film of 1994, which also relies on period pop recordings: &quot;[T]he version of &#x27;the sixties&#x27; offered by &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; ... is certainly not that of the publicly recognized counter-culture featured in &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;, but is, rather, a more genuinely marginal form of sub-culture based around a lifestyle – surfing, &#x27;hanging&#x27; – that is resolutely apolitical.&quot; The soundtrack is central, she says, to the film&#x27;s engagement with the &quot;younger, cinematically knowledgeable spectator&quot; it solicits.

== Release and reception ==

=== Release and box office ===
&quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; premiered in May 1994 at the Cannes Film Festival. The Weinsteins &quot;hit the beach like commandos,&quot; bringing the picture&#x27;s entire cast over to France. The film was unveiled at a midnight hour screening and caused a sensation. It won the Palme d&#x27;Or, the festival&#x27;s top prize, generating a further wave of publicity.

The first U.S. review of the film was published on May 23 in industry trade magazine &quot;Variety&quot;. Todd McCarthy called &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; a &quot;spectacularly entertaining piece of pop culture ... a startling, massive success.&quot; From Cannes forward, Tarantino was on the road continuously, promoting the film. Over the next few months, it played in smaller festivals around Europe, building buzz: Nottingham, Munich, Taormina, Locarno, Norway, and San Sebastián. Tarantino later said: &quot;One thing that&#x27;s cool is that by breaking up the linear structure, when I watch the film with an audience, it does break [the audience&#x27;s] alpha state. It&#x27;s like, all of a sudden, &#x27;I gotta watch this ... I gotta pay attention.&#x27; You can almost feel everybody moving in their seats. It&#x27;s actually fun to watch an audience in some ways chase after a movie.&quot; In late September, it opened the New York Film Festival. &quot;The New York Times&quot; published its review the day of the opening. Janet Maslin called the film a &quot;triumphant, cleverly disorienting journey through a demimonde that springs entirely from Mr. Tarantino&#x27;s ripe imagination, a landscape of danger, shock, hilarity and vibrant local color ... [He] has come up with a work of such depth, wit and blazing originality that it places him in the front ranks of American film makers.&quot;

On October 14, 1994, &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; went into general release in the United States. As Peter Biskind described: &quot;It was not platformed, that is, it did not open in a handful of theaters and roll out slowly as word of mouth built, the traditional way of releasing an indie film; it went wide immediately, into 1,100 theaters.&quot; In the eyes of some cultural critics, &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; had given Tarantino a reputation for glamorizing violence. Miramax played with the issue in its marketing campaign: &quot;You won&#x27;t know the facts till you&#x27;ve seen the fiction&quot;, went one slogan. &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; was the top-grossing film at the US box office its first weekend with a gross of $9,311,882, edging out a Sylvester Stallone vehicle, &quot;The Specialist&quot;, which was in its second week and playing at more than twice as many theaters. The gross claimed by Miramax was disputed by others. Warner Bros. initially reported an estimated gross of $8.9 million for &quot;The Specialist&quot;, with Bob Weinstein then reporting a gross for &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; of $9.1 million, claiming that the film was on another 100 screens that had previously been overlooked. Warners then updated their gross to $9.3 million, claiming they had made a calculation error.
Early Monday morning, Miramax reported a gross of $9.3 million with Warners reporting $8.9 million for &quot;The Specialist&quot;, placing &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; first but other industry sources did not believe Miramax&#x27;s numbers. &quot;Variety&quot; estimated that &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; grossed $8.6 to $9 million for the weekend.

Against its budget of $8.5 million and about $10 million in marketing costs, &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; grossed $107.93 million at the U.S. box office, making it the first Miramax film to surpass $100 million in the United States and Canada. Worldwide, it took in nearly $213 million. In terms of domestic grosses, it was the tenth biggest film of 1994, even though it played on substantially fewer screens than any other film in the top 20. Popular engagement with the film, such as speculation about the contents of the precious briefcase, &quot;indicates the kind of cult status that &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; achieved almost immediately.&quot; As &quot;MovieMaker&quot; puts it, &quot;The movie was nothing less than a national cultural phenomenon.&quot; Abroad, as well: in Britain, where it opened a week after its U.S. release, not only was the film a big hit, but in book form its screenplay became the most successful in UK publishing history, a top-ten bestseller.

=== Critical response ===
 On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 95 out of 100, based on 25 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

The response of major American film reviewers was widely favorable. Roger Ebert called it &quot;a comedy about blood, guts, violence, strange sex, drugs, fixed fights, dead body disposal, leather freaks and a wristwatch that makes a dark journey down through the generations... The screenplay by Tarantino and Roger Avary so well-written in a scruffy, fanzine way that you want to rub noses in it – the noses of those zombie writers who take &#x27;screenwriting&#x27; classes that teach them the formulas for &#x27;hit films. Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot; wrote: &quot;It towers over the year&#x27;s other movies as majestically and menacingly as a gang lord at a preschool. It dares Hollywood films to be this smart about going this far. If good directors accept Tarantino&#x27;s implicit challenge, the movie theater could again be a great place to live in.&quot; In &quot;Newsweek&quot;, David Ansen wrote: &quot;The miracle of Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; is how, being composed of secondhand, debased parts, it succeeds in gleaming like something new.&quot; &quot;You get intoxicated by it,&quot; wrote &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Owen Gleiberman, &quot;high on the rediscovery of how pleasurable a movie can be. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve ever encountered a filmmaker who combined discipline and control with sheer wild-ass joy the way that Tarantino does.&quot; &quot;There&#x27;s a special kick that comes from watching something this thrillingly alive&quot;, wrote Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. &quot;&quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; is indisputably great.&quot;

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; was one of the few major news outlets to publish a negative review on the film&#x27;s opening weekend. Kenneth Turan wrote: &quot;The writer-director appears to be straining for his effects. Some sequences, especially one involving bondage harnesses and homosexual rape, have the uncomfortable feeling of creative desperation, of someone who&#x27;s afraid of losing his reputation scrambling for any way to offend sensibilities.&quot; Some who reviewed it in the following weeks took more exception to the predominant critical reaction than to &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; itself. While not panning the film, Stanley Kauffmann of &quot;The New Republic&quot; felt that &quot;the way that [it] has been so widely ravened up and drooled over verges on the disgusting. &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; nourishes, abets, cultural slumming.&quot; Responding to comparisons between Tarantino&#x27;s film and the work of French New Wave director Jean-Luc Godard, especially his first, most famous feature, Jonathan Rosenbaum of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; wrote: &quot;The fact that &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; is garnering more extravagant raves than &quot;Breathless&quot; ever did tells you plenty about which kind of cultural references are regarded as more fruitful – namely, the ones we already have and don&#x27;t wish to expand.&quot; Observing in the &quot;National Review&quot; that &quot;[n]o film arrives with more advance hype&quot;, John Simon was unswayed: &quot;titillation cures neither hollowness nor shallowness&quot;.

Debate about the film spread beyond the review pages, with its violence often being the theme. In &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Donna Britt described how she was happy not to see &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; on a recent weekend and thus avoid &quot;discussing the rousing scene in which a gunshot sprays somebody&#x27;s brains around a car interior&quot;. Some commentators took exception to the film&#x27;s frequent use of the word &quot;nigger&quot; (mentioned 18 times). In the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, Todd Boyd argued that the word&#x27;s recurrence &quot;has the ability to signify the ultimate level of hipness for white males who have historically used their perception of black masculinity as the embodiment of cool&quot;. In Britain, James Wood, writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, set the tone for much subsequent criticism: &quot;Tarantino represents the final triumph of postmodernism, which is to empty the artwork of all content, thus avoiding its capacity to do anything except helplessly represent our agonies ... Only in this age could a writer as talented as Tarantino produce artworks so vacuous, so entirely stripped of any politics, metaphysics, or moral interest.&quot;

=== Awards season ===
Around the turn of the year, &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; was named Best Picture by the National Society of Film Critics, National Board of Review, Los Angeles Film Critics Association, Boston Society of Film Critics, Society of Texas Film Critics, Southeastern Film Critics Association, and Kansas City Film Critics Circle. Tarantino was named Best Director by all seven of those organizations as well as by the New York Film Critics Circle and Chicago Film Critics Association. The screenplay won several prizes, with various awarding bodies ascribing credit differently. At the 52nd Golden Globe Awards, Tarantino, named as sole recipient of the Best Screenplay honor, failed to mention Avary in his acceptance speech. In February 1995, the film received seven Oscar nominations – Best Picture, Director, Actor (Travolta), Supporting Actor (Jackson), Supporting Actress (Thurman), Original Screenplay, and Film Editing. Travolta, Jackson, and Thurman were each nominated as well for the 1st Screen Actors Guild Awards, presented on February 25, but none took home the honor. At the Academy Awards ceremony the following month, Tarantino and Avary were announced as joint winners of the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. The furor around the film was still going strong: much of the March issue of &quot;Artforum&quot; was devoted to its critical dissection. &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; garnered four honors at the Independent Spirit Awards, held at the end of the month – Best Feature, Best Director, Male Lead (Jackson), and Best Screenplay (Tarantino). At the British Academy Film Awards (BAFTA), Tarantino and Avary shared the BAFTA Award for Best Original Screenplay, and Jackson won for Best Supporting Actor. The film was nominated for the Grand Prix of the Belgian Film Critics Association.

The February 2020 issue of &quot;New York Magazine&quot; listed &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; alongside &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;, &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;, &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot;, &quot;The Conversation&quot;, &quot;Nashville&quot;, &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;, &quot;The Elephant Man&quot;, &quot;In the Bedroom&quot;, &quot;There Will Be Blood&quot;, and &quot;Roma&quot; as &quot;The Best Movies That Lost Best Picture at the Oscars&quot;.

== Legacy and influence ==
&quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; quickly came to be regarded as one of the most significant films of its era. In 1995, in a special edition of &quot;Siskel &amp; Ebert&quot; devoted to Tarantino, Gene Siskel argued that the work posed a major challenge to the &quot;ossification of American movies with their brutal formulas&quot;. In Siskel&#x27;s view,
the violent intensity of &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; calls to mind other violent watershed films that were considered classics in their time and still are. Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Psycho&quot; [1960], Arthur Penn&#x27;s &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; [1967], and Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; [1971]. Each film shook up a tired, bloated movie industry and used a world of lively lowlifes to reflect how dull other movies had become. And that, I predict, will be the ultimate honor for &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;. Like all great films, it criticizes other movies.
Ken Dancyger writes that its &quot;imitative and innovative style&quot; – like that of its predecessor, &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; – represents
a new phenomenon, the movie whose style is created from the context of movie life rather than real life. The consequence is twofold – the presumption of deep knowledge on the part of the audience of those forms such as the gangster films or Westerns, horror films or adventure films. And that the parody or alteration of that film creates a new form, a different experience for the audience.
In a widely covered speech on May 31, 1995, Bob Dole, Senate Majority Leader and Republican presidential candidate for the then-upcoming 1996 presidential election (as well as the party&#x27;s vice presidential nominee in the 1976 presidential election), attacked the American entertainment industry for peddling &quot;nightmares of depravity&quot;. &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; was soon associated with his charges concerning gratuitous violence. Dole had not mentioned the film, instead citing two less-celebrated movies based on Tarantino screenplays, Oliver Stone&#x27;s &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot; and Tony Scott&#x27;s &quot;True Romance&quot;. In September 1996, Dole did accuse &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; – which he had not seen at the time – of promoting &quot;the romance of heroin&quot;.

Paula Rabinowitz expresses the general film industry opinion that &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; &quot;simultaneously resurrected John Travolta and film noir&quot;. In Peter Biskind&#x27;s description, it created a &quot;guys-with-guns frenzy&quot;. The film has also been labeled as a black comedy and a &quot;neo-noir&quot;. Critic Geoffrey O&#x27;Brien, however, argued against the classification of &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; into the neo-noir genre: &quot;The old-time noir passions, the brooding melancholy and operatic death scenes, would be altogether out of place in the crisp and brightly lit wonderland that Tarantino conjures up. [It is] neither neo-noir nor a parody of noir.&quot; Similarly, Nicholas Christopher calls it &quot;more gangland camp than neo-noir&quot;, and Foster Hirsch suggests that its &quot;trippy fantasy landscape&quot; characterizes it more definitively than any genre label. Regardless, the stylistic influence of &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; soon became apparent. Less than a year after the picture&#x27;s release, British critic Jon Ronson attended the National Film School&#x27;s end-of-semester screenings and assessed the impact: &quot;Out of the five student movies I watched, four incorporated violent shoot-outs over a soundtrack of iconoclastic 70s pop hits, two climaxed with all the main characters shooting each other at once, and one had two hitmen discussing the idiosyncrasies of &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot; before offing their victim. Not since &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; has one man appeared from relative obscurity to redefine the art of moviemaking.&quot; Among the first Hollywood films cited as its imitators were &quot;Destiny Turns on the Radio&quot; (1995), in which Tarantino acted, &quot;Things to Do in Denver When You&#x27;re Dead&quot; (1995), and &quot;2 Days in the Valley&quot; (1996). It &quot;triggered a myriad of clones&quot;, writes Fiona Villella. Internationally, according to David Desser, it &quot;not only influenced a British brand of noir, but extended the noir vision virtually around the world&quot;. &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;″s effect on film form was still reverberating in 2007, when David Denby of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; credited it with initiating the ongoing cycle of disordered cinematic narratives.

According to &quot;Variety&quot;, the trajectory of &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; from Cannes launch to commercial smash &quot;forever altered the game&quot; of so-called independent cinema. It &quot;cemented Miramax&#x27;s place as the reigning indie superpower&quot;, writes Biskind. &quot;&quot;Pulp&quot; became the &quot;Star Wars&quot; of independents, exploding expectations for what an indie film could do at the box office.&quot; The film&#x27;s large financial return on its small budget
transform[ed] the industry&#x27;s attitude toward the lowly indies ... spawning a flock of me-too classics divisions ... [S]mart studio executives suddenly woke up to the fact that grosses and market share, which got all the press, were not the same as profits ... Once the studios realized that they could exploit the economies of (small) scale, they more or less gave up buying or remaking the films themselves, and either bought the distributors, as Disney had Miramax, or started their own ... copy[ing] Miramax&#x27;s marketing and distribution strategies.
In 2001, &quot;Variety&quot;, noting the increasing number of actors switching back and forth between expensive studio films and low-budget independent or indie-style projects, suggested that the &quot;watershed moment for movie stars&quot; came with the decision by Willis – one of Hollywood&#x27;s highest-paid performers – to appear in &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;. In 2024, on the film&#x27;s 30th anniversary, the magazine wrote that the film &quot;revived the career of John Travolta, minted a star in Samuel L. Jackson and spawned a still-thriving cottage industry of knockoffs and imitation films.&quot;

It has been described as a &quot;major cultural event&quot;, an &quot;international phenomenon&quot; that influenced television, music, literature, and advertising. Not long after its release, it was identified as a significant focus of attention within the growing community of Internet users. Adding &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; to his roster of The Great Movies in 2001, Roger Ebert called it &quot;the most influential film of the decade&quot;. Four years later, &quot;Time&quot;″s Corliss wrote much the same: &quot;(unquestionably) the most influential American movie of the 90s&quot;.

Several scenes and images from the film achieved iconic status; in 2008, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; declared, &quot;You&#x27;d be hard-pressed, by now, to name a moment from Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s film that isn&#x27;t iconic.&quot; Jules and Vincent&#x27;s &quot;Royale with Cheese&quot; dialogue became famous. It was referenced more than a decade and a half later in the Travolta vehicle &quot;From Paris with Love&quot;. The adrenalin shot to Mia Wallace&#x27;s heart is on &quot;Premiere&quot;″s list of &quot;100 Greatest Movie Moments&quot;. The scene of Travolta and Thurman&#x27;s characters dancing has been frequently homaged, most unambiguously in the 2005 film &quot;Be Cool&quot;, starring the same two actors. The image of Travolta and Jackson&#x27;s characters standing side by side in suit and tie, pointing their guns, has also become widely familiar. In 2007, BBC News reported that &quot;London transport workers have painted over an iconic mural by &#x27;guerrilla artist&#x27; Banksy ... The image depicted a scene from Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, with Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta clutching bananas instead of guns.&quot; Certain lines were adopted popularly as catchphrases, in particular Marsellus&#x27;s threat, &quot;I&#x27;m &#x27;a get medieval on your ass.&quot; Jules&#x27;s &quot;Ezekiel&quot; recitation was voted the fourth greatest movie speech of all time in a 2004 poll. One of the more notable homages to Jules&#x27;s &quot;Biblical&quot; quote was one Jackson himself played a part in, near the end of 2014&#x27;s &quot;Captain America: The Winter Soldier&quot;, Jackson&#x27;s character Col. Nick Fury, presumed dead, visits his own gravestone, on which, below Fury&#x27;s name is inscribed &quot;The path of the righteous man ...&quot; Ezekiel 25:17. In 2019, it was reported that Dominic Cummings, special political adviser to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, quoted Jules by telling Conservative MPs to &quot;be cool like Fonzies&quot; as political pressure built to request an extension to the date of the UK&#x27;s withdrawal from the European Union.

&quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; now appears in several critical assessments of all-time great films. In 2008, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; named it the best film of the past quarter-century. That same year, the American Film Institute&#x27;s &quot;Ten Top Ten&quot; poll ranked it number 7 all-time in the gangster film genre. In 2007, it was voted 94th overall on the AFI&#x27;s 100 Years ... 100 Movies list. In 2005, it was named one of &quot;Time&#x27;s All-Time 100 Movies&quot;. As of September 2018, it is number 54 on Metacritic&#x27;s list of all-time highest scores. The film ranks very highly in popular surveys. A 2008 &quot;Empire&quot; poll combining the opinions of readers, movie industry professionals, and critics named &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; the ninth-best film of all time. In a 2006 readers&#x27; poll by the British magazine &quot;Total Film&quot;, it ranked as the number three film in history. It was voted as the fourth-greatest film of all time in a nationwide poll for Britain&#x27;s Channel 4 in 2001. In 2015, &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; ranked 28th on BBC&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest American Films&quot; list, voted on by film critics from around the world.

== Critical analysis ==
Tarantino has stated that he originally planned &quot;to do a &quot;Black Mask&quot; movie&quot;, referring to the magazine largely responsible for popularizing hardboiled detective fiction. &quot;[I]t kind of went somewhere else&quot;. Geoffrey O&#x27;Brien sees the result as connected &quot;rather powerfully to a parallel pulp tradition: the tales of terror and the uncanny practiced by such writers as Cornell Woolrich [and] Fredric Brown ... Both dealt heavily in the realm of improbable coincidences and cruel cosmic jokes, a realm that &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; makes its own.&quot; In particular, O&#x27;Brien finds a strong affinity between the intricate plot mechanics and twists of Brown&#x27;s novels and the recursive, interweaving structure of &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;. Philip French describes the film&#x27;s narrative as a &quot;circular movement or Möbius strip of a kind Resnais and Robbe-Grillet would admire&quot;. James Mottram regards crime novelist Elmore Leonard, whose influence Tarantino has acknowledged, as the film&#x27;s primary literary antecedent. He suggests that Leonard&#x27;s &quot;rich dialogue&quot; is reflected in Tarantino&#x27;s &quot;popular-culture-strewn jive&quot;; he also points to the acute, extremely dark sense of humor Leonard applies to the realm of violence as a source of inspiration.

Film scholar/historian Robert Kolker sees the &quot;flourishes, the apparent witty banality of the dialogue, the goofy fracturing of temporality [as] a patina over a pastiche. The pastiche ... is essentially of two films that Tarantino can&#x27;t seem to get out of his mind: &quot;Mean Streets&quot; [1973; directed by Martin Scorsese, who loved &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; and the way the film was told] and &quot;The Killing&quot; [1956; directed by Stanley Kubrick].&quot; He contrasts &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; with postmodern Hollywood predecessors &quot;Hudson Hawk&quot; (1991; starring Willis) and &quot;Last Action Hero&quot; (1993; starring Arnold Schwarzenegger) that &quot;took the joke too far ... simply mocked or suggested that they were smarter than the audience&quot; and flopped. Todd McCarthy writes that the film&#x27;s &quot;striking widescreen compositions often contain objects in extreme close-up as well as vivid contrasts, sometimes bringing to mind the visual strategies of Sergio Leone&quot;, an acknowledged hero of Tarantino&#x27;s. To Martin Rubin, the &quot;expansive, brightly colored widescreen visuals&quot; evoke comedy directors such as Frank Tashlin and Blake Edwards.

The movie&#x27;s host of pop culture allusions, ranging from the famous image of Marilyn Monroe&#x27;s skirt flying up over a subway grating to Jules addressing a soon-to-be victim as &quot;Flock of Seagulls&quot; because of his haircut, have led many critics to discuss it within the framework of postmodernism. Describing the film in 2005 as Tarantino&#x27;s &quot;postmodern masterpiece ... to date&quot;, David Walker writes that it &quot;is marked by its playful reverence for the 1950s ... and its constantly teasing and often deferential references to other films&quot;. He characterizes its convoluted narrative technique as &quot;postmodern tricksiness&quot;. Calling the film a &quot;terminally hip postmodern collage&quot;, Foster Hirsch finds &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; far from a masterpiece: &quot;authoritative, influential, and meaningless&quot;. Set &quot;in a world that could exist only in the movies&quot;, it is &quot;a succulent guilty pleasure, beautifully made junk food for cinéastes&quot;. O&#x27;Brien, dismissing attempts to associate the movie with film noir, argues that &quot;&quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; is more a guided tour of an infernal theme park decorated with cultural detritus, Buddy Holly and Mamie Van Doren, fragments of blaxploitation and Roger Corman and &quot;Shogun Assassin&quot;, music out of a twenty-four-hour oldies station for which all the decades since the fifties exist simultaneously.&quot; Catherine Constable takes the moment in which a needle filled with adrenalin is plunged into the comatose Mia&#x27;s heart as exemplary. She proposes that it &quot;can be seen as effecting her resurrection from the dead, simultaneously recalling and undermining the Gothic convention of the vampire&#x27;s stake. On this model, the referencing of previous aesthetic forms and styles moves beyond ... empty pastiche, sustaining an &#x27;inventive and affirmative&#x27; mode of postmodernism.&quot;

Mark T. Conard asks, &quot;[W]hat is the film &quot;about&quot;?&quot; and answers, &quot;American nihilism.&quot; Hirsch suggests, &quot;If the film is actually about anything other than its own cleverness, it seems dedicated to the dubious thesis that hit men are part of the human family.&quot; Richard Alleva argues that &quot;&quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; has about as much to do with actual criminality or violence as &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot; with the realities of seventeenth-century France or &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot; with Balkan politics.&quot; He reads the movie as a form of romance whose allure is centered in the characters&#x27; nonnaturalistic discourse, &quot;wise-guy literate, media-smart, obscenely epigrammatic&quot;. In Alan Stone&#x27;s view, the &quot;absurd dialogue&quot;, like that between Vincent and Jules in the scene where the former accidentally kills Marvin, &quot;unexpectedly transforms the meaning of the violence cliché ... &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; unmasks the macho myth by making it laughable and deheroicizes the power trip glorified by standard Hollywood violence.&quot; Stone reads the film as &quot;politically correct. There is no nudity and no violence directed against women ... [It] celebrates interracial friendship and cultural diversity; there are strong women and strong black men, and the director swims against the current of class stereotype.&quot;

Where Stone sees a celebration, Kolker finds a vacuum: &quot;The postmodern insouciance, violence, homophobia, and racism of &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; were perfectly acceptable because the film didn&#x27;t pretend seriousness and therefore didn&#x27;t mock it.&quot; Calling it the &quot;acme of postmodern nineties filmmaking&quot;, he explains, &quot;the postmodern is about surfaces; it is flattened spatiality in which event and character are in a steady state of reminding us that they are pop-cultural figures.&quot; According to Kolker:
That&#x27;s why &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; was so popular. Not because all audiences got all or any of its references to Scorsese and Kubrick, but because the narrative and spatial structure of the film never threatened to go beyond themselves into signification. The film&#x27;s cycle of racist and homophobic jokes might threaten to break out into a quite nasty view of the world, but this nastiness keeps being laughed off – by the mock intensity of the action, the prowling, confronting, perverse, confined, and airless nastiness of the world Tarantino creates.
Henry A. Giroux argues that Tarantino &quot;empties violence of any critical social consequences, offering viewers only the immediacy of shock, humor, and irony-without-insight as elements of mediation. None of these elements gets beyond the seduction of voyeuristic gazing ... [t]he facile consumption of shocking images and hallucinatory delight.&quot;

Regarding the violence and nihilism in the film, Pamela Demory has suggested that &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; should be seen in light of the short stories of Flannery O&#x27;Connor, which likewise feature &quot;religious elements, banality, and violence with grotesque humor.&quot; Discussing &quot;the connection between violence and redemption,&quot; Demory concludes that while O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s purpose is to convince readers &quot;of the powerful force of evil in the world and of our need for grace,&quot; Tarantino &quot;seeks to demonstrate that in spite of everything we have seen in the film – all the violence, degradation, death, crime, amoral behavior – grace is still possible; there might still be a God who doesn&#x27;t judge us on merits.&quot;

=== Homage as essence ===
==== Cinema ====
&quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; is full of homages to other movies. &quot;Tarantino&#x27;s characters&quot;, writes Gary Groth, &quot;inhabit a world where the entire landscape is composed of Hollywood product. Tarantino is a cinematic kleptomaniac – he literally can&#x27;t help himself.&quot; Two scenes in particular have prompted discussion of the film&#x27;s highly intertextual style. Many have assumed that the dance sequence at Jack Rabbit Slim&#x27;s was intended as a reference to Travolta&#x27;s star-making performance as Tony Manero in the epochal &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; (1977); Tarantino, however, credits a scene in the Jean-Luc Godard film &quot;Bande à part&quot; (1964) with the inspiration. According to the filmmaker;
Everybody thinks that I wrote this scene just to have John Travolta dancing. But the scene existed before John Travolta was cast. But once he was cast, it was like, &quot;Great. We get to see John dance. All the better.&quot;... My favorite musical sequences have always been in Godard, because they just come out of nowhere. It&#x27;s so infectious, so friendly. And the fact that it&#x27;s not a musical, but he&#x27;s stopping the movie to have a musical sequence, makes it all the more sweet.
Jerome Charyn argues that, beyond &quot;all the better&quot;, Travolta&#x27;s presence is essential to the power of the scene, and of the film:
Travolta&#x27;s entire career becomes &quot;backstory&quot;, the myth of a movie star who has fallen out of favor, but still resides in our memory as the king of disco. We keep waiting for him to shed his paunch, put on a white polyester suit, and enter the 2001 Odyssey club in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, where he will dance for us and never, never stop. Daniel Day-Lewis couldn&#x27;t have woken such a powerful longing in us. He isn&#x27;t part of America&#x27;s own mad cosmology ... Tony Manero [is] an angel sitting on Vince&#x27;s shoulder ... [Vince and Mia&#x27;s] actual dance may be closer to the choreography of Anna Karina&#x27;s shuffle with her two bumbling gangster boyfriends in &quot;Bande à part&quot;, but even &quot;that&quot; reference is lost to us, and we&#x27;re with Tony again ...
Estella Tincknell notes that while the &quot;diner setting seems to be a simulacrum of a &#x27;fifties&#x27; restaurant ... the twist contest is a musical sequence which evokes &#x27;the sixties,&#x27; while Travolta&#x27;s dance performance inevitably references &#x27;the seventies&#x27; and his appearance in &quot;Saturday Night Fever.&quot; ... The &#x27;past&#x27; thus becomes a more general &#x27;pastness&#x27; in which the stylistic signifiers of various decades are loaded in to a single moment.&quot; She also argues that in this passage the film &quot;briefly shifts from its habitually ironic discourse to one that references the conventions of the classic film musical and in doing so makes it possible for the film to inhabit an affective space that goes beyond stylistic allusion.&quot;

The pivotal moment in which Marsellus crosses the street in front of Butch&#x27;s car and notices him evokes the scene in which Marion Crane&#x27;s boss sees her under similar circumstances in &quot;Psycho&quot; (1960). Marsellus and Butch are soon held captive by Maynard and Zed, &quot;two sadistic honkies straight out of &quot;Deliverance&quot;&quot; (1972), directed by John Boorman. Zed shares a name with Sean Connery&#x27;s character in Boorman&#x27;s follow-up, the science-fiction film &quot;Zardoz&quot; (1974). When Butch decides to rescue Marsellus, in Glyn White&#x27;s words, &quot;he finds a trove of items with film-hero resonances&quot;. Critics have identified these weapons with a range of possible allusions:
* Hammer – &quot;The Toolbox Murders&quot; (1978)
* Baseball bat – &quot;Walking Tall&quot; (1973); &quot;The Untouchables&quot; (1987)
* Chainsaw – &quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot; (1974); &quot;Evil Dead II&quot; (1987)
* Katana (samurai sword) – many, including &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; (1954); &quot;The Yakuza&quot; (1975); and &quot;Shogun Assassin&quot; (1980)

At the conclusion of the scene, a portentous line of Marsellus&#x27;s echoes one from the crime drama &quot;Charley Varrick&quot; (1973), directed by another of Tarantino&#x27;s heroes, Don Siegel; the name of the character who speaks it there is Maynard.

David Bell argues that far from going against the &quot;current of class stereotype&quot;, this scene, like &quot;Deliverance&quot;, &quot;mobilize[s] a certain construction of poor white country folk – and particularly their sexualization ... &#x27;rustic sexual expression often takes the form of homosexual rape&#x27; in American movies.&quot; Stephen Paul Miller believes the &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; scene goes down much easier than the one it echoes: &quot;The buggery perpetrated is not at all as shocking as it was in &quot;Deliverance&quot; ... The nineties film reduces seventies competition, horror, and taboo into an entertainingly subtle adrenaline play – a fiction, a pulp fiction.&quot; Giroux reads the rape scene homage similarly: &quot;in the end Tarantino&#x27;s use of parody is about repetition, transgression, and softening the face of violence by reducing it to the property of film history.&quot; In Groth&#x27;s view, the crucial difference is that &quot;in &quot;Deliverance&quot; the rape created the film&#x27;s central moral dilemma whereas in &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; it was merely &#x27;the single weirdest day of [Butch&#x27;s] life.&#x27;&quot; (&quot;&quot;American Me&quot; did it too,&quot; Tarantino observed. &quot;There&#x27;s like &quot;three&quot; butt-fucking scenes in &quot;American Me&quot;. That&#x27;s definitely the one to beat in that particular category!&quot;)

Neil Fulwood focuses on Butch&#x27;s weapon selection, writing, &quot;Here, Tarantino&#x27;s love of movies is at its most open and nonjudgemental, tipping a nod to the noble and the notorious, as well as sending up his own reputation as an enfant terrible of movie violence. Moreover, the scene makes a sly comment about the readiness of cinema to seize upon whatever is to hand for its moments of mayhem and murder.&quot; White asserts that &quot;the katana he finally, and significantly, selects identifies him with ... honourable heroes.&quot; Conard argues that the first three items symbolize a nihilism that Butch is rejecting. The traditional Japanese sword, in contrasts, represents a culture with a well-defined moral code and thus connects Butch with a more meaningful approach to life.

The biker film &quot;Nam&#x27;s Angels&quot; is also shown with Fabienne characterizing it as &quot;A motorcycle movie, I&#x27;m not sure the name.&quot;

==== Television ====
Robert Miklitsch argues that &quot;Tarantino&#x27;s telephilia&quot; may be more central to the guiding sensibility of &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; than the filmmaker&#x27;s love for rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll and even cinema:
Talking about his generation, one that came of age in the &#x27;70s, Tarantino has commented that the &quot;number one thing we all shared wasn&#x27;t music, that was a Sixties thing. Our culture was television.&quot; A random list of the TV programs referenced in &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; confirms his observation: &quot;Speed Racer, Clutch Cargo, The Brady Bunch, The Partridge Family, The Avengers, The Three Stooges, The Flintstones, I Spy, Green Acres, Kung Fu, Happy Days&quot;, and last but not least, Mia&#x27;s fictional pilot, &quot;Fox Force Five&quot;.
&quot;The above list, with the possible exception of &quot;The Avengers&quot;,&quot; writes Miklitsch, &quot;suggests that &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; has less of an elective affinity with the cinematic avant-gardism of Godard than with mainstream network programming.&quot; Jonathan Rosenbaum had brought TV into his analysis of the Tarantino/Godard comparison, acknowledging that the directors were similar in wanting to cram everything they like onscreen: &quot;But the differences between what Godard likes and what Tarantino likes and why are astronomical; it&#x27;s like comparing a combined museum, library, film archive, record shop, and department store with a jukebox, a video-rental outlet, and an issue of TV Guide.&quot;

Sharon Willis focuses on the way a television show (&quot;Clutch Cargo&quot;) marks the beginning of, and plays on through, the scene between young Butch and his father&#x27;s comrade-in-arms. The Vietnam War veteran is played by Christopher Walken, whose presence in the role evokes his performance as a traumatized G.I. in the Vietnam War movie &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; (1978). Willis writes that &quot;when Captain Koons enters the living room, we see Walken in his function as an image retrieved from a repertoire of 1970s television and movie versions of ruined masculinity in search of rehabilitation ... [T]he gray light of the television presiding over the scene seems to inscribe the ghostly paternal gaze.&quot; Miklitsch asserts that, for some critics, the film is a &quot;prime example of the pernicious ooze-like influence of mass culture exemplified by their bête noire: TV.&quot; Kolker might not disagree, arguing that &quot;&quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; is a simulacrum of our daily exposure to television; its homophobes, thugs and perverts, sentimental boxers and pimp promoters move through a series of long-take tableaux: we watch, laugh, and remain with nothing to comprehend.&quot;

=== Notable motifs ===

==== The mysterious 666 briefcase ====
The combination of the mysterious suitcase lock is 666, the &quot;Number of the Beast&quot;. Tarantino has said there is no explanation for its contents – it is simply a MacGuffin, a pure plot device. Originally, the case was to contain diamonds, but this was seen as too mundane. For filming purposes, it contained a hidden orange light bulb that produced an otherworldly glow when the case was opened. In a 2007 video interview with fellow director and friend Robert Rodriguez, Tarantino purportedly &quot;reveals&quot; the secret contents of the briefcase, but the film cuts out and skips the scene in the style employed in Tarantino and Rodriguez&#x27;s &quot;Grindhouse&quot; (2007), with an intertitle that reads &quot;Missing Reel&quot;. The interview resumes with Rodriguez discussing how radically the &quot;knowledge&quot; of the briefcase&#x27;s contents alters one&#x27;s understanding of the movie.

Despite Tarantino&#x27;s statements, many solutions to what one scholar calls this &quot;unexplained postmodern puzzle&quot; have been proposed. A strong similarity has often been observed with Robert Aldrich&#x27;s 1955 film noir &quot;Kiss Me Deadly&quot;, which features a glowing briefcase housing an atomic explosive. In their review of Alex Cox&#x27;s 1984 film &quot;Repo Man&quot; in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, Nick Cowen and Hari Patience suggest that &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; may also owe &quot;a debt of inspiration&quot; to the glowing car trunk in that film. In scholar Paul Gormley&#x27;s view, this connection with &quot;Kiss Me Deadly&quot;, and a similar one with &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; (1981), makes it possible to read the eerie glow as symbolic of violence itself. The idea that the briefcase contains Marsellus&#x27;s soul gained popular currency in the mid-1990s. Analyzing the notion, Roger Ebert dismissed it as &quot;nothing more than a widely distributed urban legend given false credibility by the mystique of the Net&quot;.

==== Jules&#x27; Bible passage ====
Jules ritually recites what he describes as a biblical passage, Ezekiel 25:17, before he executes someone. The passage is heard three times – in the introductory sequence in which Jules and Vincent reclaim Marsellus&#x27;s briefcase from the doomed Brett; that same recitation a second time, at the beginning of &quot;The Bonnie Situation&quot;, which overlaps the end of the earlier sequence; and in the epilogue at the diner. The first version of the passage is as follows:

The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who in the name of charity and goodwill shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother&#x27;s keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.

The second version, from the diner scene, is identical except for the final line: &quot;And you will know I am the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon you.&quot;

While the final two sentences of Jules&#x27;s speech are similar to the actual cited passage, the first two are fabricated from various biblical phrases. The text of Ezekiel 25 preceding verse 17 indicates that God&#x27;s wrath is retribution for the hostility of the Philistines. In the King James Version from which Jules&#x27;s speech is adapted, Ezekiel 25:17 reads in its entirety:

And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes; and they shall know that I &quot;am&quot; the LORD, when I shall lay My vengeance upon them.

Tarantino&#x27;s primary inspiration for the speech was the work of Japanese martial arts star Sonny Chiba. Its text and its identification as Ezekiel 25:17 derive from an almost identical creed that appears at the beginning of the Chiba movie &quot;Karate Kiba&quot; (&quot;The Bodyguard&quot;; 1976), where it is both shown as a scrolling text and read by an offscreen narrator.

The version seen at the beginning of &quot;The Bodyguard&quot; (1976) is as follows:

The path of the righteous man and defender is beset on all sides by the inequity of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he, who in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother&#x27;s keeper, and the father of lost children. And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious anger, who poison and destroy my brothers; and they shall know that I am Chiba the Bodyguard when I shall lay my vengeance upon them!

In the 1980s television series &quot;Kage no Gundan&quot; (&quot;Shadow Warriors&quot;), Chiba&#x27;s character would lecture the villain-of-the-week about how the world must be rid of evil before killing him. A killer delivers a similar biblical rant in &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot;, the hardback but pulp-style novel Vincent is shown with in two scenes.

Two critics who have analyzed the role of the speech find different ties between Jules&#x27;s transformation and the issue of postmodernity. Gormley argues that unlike the film&#x27;s other major characters – Marsellus aside – Jules is:
linked to a &quot;thing&quot; beyond postmodern simulation ... [T]his is perhaps most marked when he moves on from being a simulation of a Baptist preacher, spouting Ezekiel because it was &quot;just a cool thing to say ...&quot; In his conversion, Jules is shown to be cognizant of a place beyond this simulation, which, in this case, the film constructs as God.
Adele Reinhartz writes that the &quot;depth of Jules&#x27;s transformation&quot; is indicated by the difference in his two deliveries of the passage: &quot;In the first, he is a majestic and awe-inspiring figure, proclaiming the prophecy with fury and self-righteousness ... In the second ... he appears to be a different sort of man altogether ... [I]n true postmodern fashion, [he] reflects on the meaning of his speech and provides several different ways that it might pertain to his current situation.&quot; Similar to Gormley, Conard argues that as Jules reflects on the passage, it dawns on him &quot;that it refers to an objective framework of value and meaning that is absent from his life&quot;; to Conard, this contrasts with the film&#x27;s prevalent representation of a nihilistic culture. Rosenbaum finds much less in Jules&#x27;s revelation: &quot;[T]he spiritual awakening at the end of &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, which Jackson performs beautifully, is a piece of jive avowedly inspired by kung-fu movies. It may make you feel good, but it certainly doesn&#x27;t leave you any wiser.&quot;

==== The bathroom ====
Much of &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;″s action revolves around characters who are either in the bathroom or need to use the toilet. To a lesser extent, Tarantino&#x27;s other films also feature this narrative element. At Jack Rabbit Slim&#x27;s, Mia goes to &quot;powder her nose&quot; – literally; she snorts coke in the restroom, surrounded by a bevy of women vainly primping. Butch and Fabienne play an extended scene in their motel bathroom, he in the shower, she brushing her teeth; the next morning, but just a few seconds later in screen time, she is again brushing her teeth – vigorously, after having given Butch &quot;oral pleasure.&quot; As Jules and Vincent confront Brett and two of his pals, a fourth man is hiding in the bathroom – his actions will lead to Jules&#x27; transformative &quot;moment of clarity&quot;. After Marvin&#x27;s absurd death, Vincent and Jules wash up in Jimmie&#x27;s bathroom, where they get into a contretemps over a bloody hand towel. When the diner holdup turns into a standoff, &quot;Honey Bunny&quot; whines, &quot;I gotta go pee!&quot;

As described by Peter and Will Brooker, &quot;In three significant moments Vincent retires to the bathroom [and] returns to an utterly changed world where death is threatened.&quot; The threat increases in magnitude as the narrative progresses chronologically, and is realized in the third instance:

# Vincent and Jules&#x27;s diner breakfast and philosophical conversation is aborted by Vincent&#x27;s bathroom break; an armed robbery ensues while Vincent is reading on the toilet.
# While Vincent is in the bathroom worrying about the possibility of going too far with Marsellus&#x27;s wife, Mia mistakes his heroin for cocaine, snorts it, and overdoses.
# During a stakeout at Butch&#x27;s apartment, Vincent emerges from the toilet with his book and is killed by Butch.

In the Brookers&#x27; analysis, &quot;Through Vince ... we see the contemporary world as utterly contingent, transformed, disastrously, in the instant you are not looking.&quot; Fraiman finds it particularly significant that Vincent is reading &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot; in two of these instances. She links this fact with the traditional derisive view of women as &quot;the archetypal consumers of pulp&quot;:
Locating popular fiction in the bathroom, Tarantino reinforces its association with shit, already suggested by the dictionary meanings of &quot;pulp&quot; that preface the movie: moist, shapeless matter; also, lurid stories on cheap paper. What we have then is a series of damaging associations – pulp, women, shit – that taint not only male producers of mass-market fiction but also male consumers. Perched on the toilet with his book, Vincent is feminized by sitting instead of standing as well as by his trashy tastes; preoccupied by the anal, he is implicitly infantilized and homosexualized; and the seemingly inevitable result is being pulverized by Butch with a Czech M61 submachine gun. That this fate has to do with Vincent&#x27;s reading habits is strongly suggested by a slow tilt from the book on the floor directly up to the corpse spilled into the tub.
Willis reads &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; in almost precisely the opposite direction, finding &quot;its overarching project as a drive to turn shit into gold. This is one way of describing the project of redeeming and recycling popular culture, especially the popular culture of one&#x27;s childhood, as is Tarantino&#x27;s wont as well as his stated aim.&quot; Despite that, argues Fraiman, &quot;&quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; demonstrates ... that even an open pulpophile like Tarantino may continue to feel anxious and emasculated by his preferences.&quot;

== Accolades ==

&quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; won eight major awards from a total of twenty-six nominations, including a Best Original Screenplay win at the 67th Academy Awards. Also, in the balloting by the National Society of Film Critics, Samuel L. Jackson was the runner-up in both the Best Actor and the Best Supporting Actor categories.

<text>John Joseph Travolta (born February 18, 1954) is an American actor. He began acting in television before transitioning into a leading man in films. His accolades include a  Primetime Emmy Award and three Golden Globe Awards, in addition to nominations for two Academy Awards, a British Academy Film Award, and three Screen Actors Guild Awards.

Travolta came to prominence starring in the sitcom &quot;Welcome Back, Kotter&quot; (1975–1979), followed by leading roles in &quot;Carrie&quot; (1976), &quot;Grease&quot; (1978), &quot;Urban Cowboy&quot; (1980), and &quot;Blow Out&quot; (1981). He earned nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his roles in &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; (1977) and &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; (1994). His other notable films include &quot;Get Shorty&quot; (1995), &quot;Broken Arrow&quot; (1996), &quot;Michael&quot; (1996), &quot;Face/Off&quot; (1997), &quot;A Civil Action&quot; (1998), &quot;Primary Colors&quot; (1998), &quot;The General&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1999), &quot;The Punisher&quot; (2004), &quot;Wild Hogs&quot; (2007), &quot;Hairspray&quot; (2007), &quot;Bolt&quot; (2008), and &quot;Savages&quot; (2012).

Travolta returned to television portraying lawyer Robert Shapiro in the series &quot;The People v. O. J. Simpson: American Crime Story&quot;. He received an Emmy Award as a producer as well as nominations for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Movie. He was also Emmy-nominated for his role in the action-comedy web series &quot;Die Hart&quot; (2021). 

Outside of acting, Travolta has released nine albums, including four singles that have charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100&#x27;s Top 40. His albums have typically accompanied films he has starred in, such as &quot;&quot; (1978), which topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Travolta is also a private pilot.

==Early life==
The youngest of six children, Travolta was born and raised in Englewood, an inner-ring suburb of New York City in Bergen County, New Jersey.

His father, Salvatore &quot;Sam&quot; Travolta, was a semiprofessional American football player turned tire salesman and partner in a tire company, Travolta Tire Exchange. His mother, Helen Cecilia (&quot;née&quot; Burke), was an actress and singer who had appeared in The Sunshine Sisters, a radio vocal group, and acted and directed before becoming a high school drama and English teacher. His siblings Joey, Ellen, Ann, Margaret, and Sam Travolta were all inspired by their mother&#x27;s love of theater and drama and became actors. His father was a second-generation Italian American with roots in Godrano, Sicily, and his mother was Irish American.

He grew up in an Irish-American neighborhood and said that his household was predominantly Irish in culture. He was raised Catholic, but later converted to Scientology in 1975 at age 21. He converted after being given the book &quot;&quot; from former actress Joan Prather. Travolta attended Dwight Morrow High School, but dropped out as a junior at age 17 in 1971.

==Career==
===1970s ===

After dropping out of school, Travolta moved across the Hudson River to New York City and landed a role in the touring company of the musical &quot;Grease&quot; as Doody and on Broadway in &quot;Over Here!&quot;, singing the Sherman Brothers&#x27; song &quot;Dream Drummin&#x27;&quot;. He then moved to Los Angeles for professional reasons. Travolta&#x27;s first screen role in California was as a fall victim in &quot;Emergency!&quot; (Season 2, Episode 2) in September 1972, but his first significant movie role was as Billy Nolan, a bully who was goaded into playing a prank on Sissy Spacek&#x27;s character in the horror film &quot;Carrie&quot; (1976) directed by Brian de Palma. Around that time, he landed his star-making role as Vinnie Barbarino in the ABC TV sitcom &quot;Welcome Back, Kotter&quot; (1975–1979), in which his sister, Ellen, also occasionally appeared (as Arnold Horshack&#x27;s mother).

Travolta had a hit single titled &quot;Let Her In&quot;, peaking at number 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart in July 1976. In the next few years, he starred in the television movie &quot;The Boy in the Plastic Bubble&quot; and two of his most noted screen roles: Tony Manero in the dance drama &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; (1977) and Danny Zuko in the musical &quot;Grease&quot; (1978). The films were among the most commercially successful pictures of the decade and catapulted Travolta to international stardom. &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; earned him a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor, making him, at age 24, one of the youngest performers ever nominated for the Best Actor Oscar. His mother and his sister Ann appeared very briefly in &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; and his sister Ellen played a waitress in &quot;Grease&quot;. Travolta performed on the &quot;Grease&quot; soundtrack album. After the failure of the romance &quot;Moment by Moment&quot; (1978), in which he starred with Lily Tomlin, Travolta rebounded in 1980, riding a nationwide country music craze that followed on the heels of his hit film &quot;Urban Cowboy&quot;, in which he starred with Debra Winger.

===1980s ===
Travolta followed up &quot;Urban Cowboy&quot; with a starring role in Brian de Palma&#x27;s 1981 film &quot;Blow Out&quot;, which was critically lauded but a box office disappointment, likely due to its bleak ending. After &quot;Blow Out&quot; came a series of commercial and critical failures which sidelined Travolta&#x27;s acting career. These included &quot;Two of a Kind&quot; (1983), a romantic comedy reuniting him with Olivia Newton-John, and &quot;Perfect&quot; (1985), co-starring Jamie Lee Curtis. He also starred in &quot;Staying Alive&quot;, the 1983 sequel to &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot;, for which he trained rigorously to portray a professional dancer and lost ; the film was a financial success, grossing over $65 million, though it, too, was scorned by critics.

During that time, Travolta was offered, but declined, lead roles in what would become box-office hits, including &quot;American Gigolo&quot; and &quot;An Officer and a Gentleman&quot;, both of which went to Richard Gere, as well as &quot;Splash&quot;, which went to Tom Hanks. In 1989, Travolta starred with Kirstie Alley in &quot;Look Who&#x27;s Talking&quot;, which grossed $297 million, making it his most successful film since &quot;Grease&quot;. 

===1990s ===
Travolta subsequently starred in &quot;Look Who&#x27;s Talking Too&quot; (1990) and &quot;Look Who&#x27;s Talking Now&quot; (1993), but it was not until he played against type as Vincent Vega in Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s hit &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; (1994), with Samuel L. Jackson, for which he received an Academy Award nomination, that his career was revived. It was Travolta&#x27;s third film alongside Bruce Willis. The movie shifted him back onto the A-list and notable roles that followed include a movie-buff loan shark in &quot;Get Shorty&quot; (1995), a factory worker in &quot;White Man&#x27;s Burden&quot; (1995), a corrupt U.S. Air Force pilot in &quot;Broken Arrow&quot; (1996), an everyman with extraordinary powers in &quot;Phenomenon&quot; (1996), an archangel in &quot;Michael&quot; (1996), an FBI agent and terrorist in &quot;Face/Off&quot; (1997), a desperate attorney in &quot;A Civil Action&quot; (1998), a Bill Clinton–esque presidential candidate in &quot;Primary Colors&quot; (1998), and a military investigator in &quot;The General&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1999).

===2000s ===
In 2000, Travolta starred in and co-produced the science fiction film &quot;Battlefield Earth&quot;, based on the novel of the same name by L. Ron Hubbard, in which he played the villainous leading role as a leader of a group of aliens that enslaves humanity on a bleak future Earth. The film was a dream project for Travolta since the book&#x27;s release in 1982, when Hubbard wrote to him to try to help make a film adaptation. The film received almost universally negative reviews and did very poorly at the box office. Travolta&#x27;s performance in &quot;Battlefield Earth&quot; also earned him two Razzie Awards.

Throughout the 2000s, Travolta remained busy as an actor, starring in &quot;Swordfish&quot; (2001); &quot;Lucky Numbers&quot; (2000); &quot;Domestic Disturbance&quot; (2001); &quot;Ladder 49&quot; (2004); &quot;Be Cool&quot; (2005); &quot;Lonely Hearts&quot; (2006); &quot;Wild Hogs&quot; (2007); the Disney animated film &quot;Bolt&quot; (2008), in which Travolta voiced the title character; &quot;The Taking of Pelham 123&quot;; and &quot;Old Dogs&quot; (both 2009).

In 2007, Travolta played Edna Turnblad in the remake of &quot;Hairspray&quot;, his first musical since &quot;Grease&quot;.

=== 2010s ===
Since 2010, Travolta has starred mostly in action films and thrillers, such as &quot;From Paris with Love&quot; (2010) and &quot;Savages&quot; (2012). In 2016, he returned to television in the first season of the anthology series &quot;American Crime Story&quot;, titled &quot;The People v. O. J. Simpson&quot;, in which he played lawyer Robert Shapiro. For his performance he received a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie.

=== 2020s ===
Following the death of his wife Kelly Preston in July 2020, Travolta hinted on his Instagram account that he would be putting his career on hold, stating, &quot;I will be taking some time to be there for my children who have lost their mother, so forgive me in advance if you don&#x27;t hear from us for a while&quot;.

== Other ventures ==

=== Aviation ===
Travolta is a pilot and rated to fly Boeing 707, 737, and 747 planes. He owns four aircraft. Travolta owned an ex-Qantas Boeing 707-138B (Ex-VH-EBM) which bears an old livery of Qantas, and Travolta acted as an official goodwill ambassador for the airline wherever he flew. Travolta named his 707 &quot;Jett Clipper Ella&quot;, in honor of his children. The &quot;Clipper&quot; in the name refers to the use of that word by Pan Am as the company&#x27;s call sign as well as in the names of their aircraft. In 2017, Travolta donated the Boeing 707 to the Historical Aircraft Restoration Society (HARS) near Wollongong, Australia. This was expected to be flown to Australia in November 2019, but was later delayed to sometime in 2020 due to condition of the aircraft. Travolta planned to be on board when the aircraft was to be flown to Illawarra Regional Airport, where HARS is based, but was not allowed to fly it, because it was to be registered as an Australian aircraft.

On November 24, 1992, Travolta was piloting his Gulfstream N728T at night above a solid undercast when he experienced a total electrical system failure while flying under instrument flight rules into Washington National Airport. During the emergency landing, he almost had a mid-air collision with a USAir Boeing 727, an event attributed to a risky decision by an air traffic controller.

In 1984, Travolta was inducted into the American Academy of Achievement and presented with the Golden Plate Award by Awards Council member General Chuck Yeager, USAF. Travolta was inducted into the Living Legends of Aviation in 2007 and acts as the award show&#x27;s official ambassador.

On September 13, 2010, during the first episode of the final season of her talk show, Oprah Winfrey announced that she would be taking her entire studio audience on an eight-day, all-expenses-paid trip to Australia, with Travolta serving as pilot for the trip. He had helped Winfrey plan the trip for more than a year.

He is the author of the book &quot;Propeller One-Way Night Coach&quot;, the story of a young boy&#x27;s first flight.

His estate in Ocala, Florida, is situated at Jumbolair Airport with its own runway and taxiway right to his house, with two outbuildings for covered access to planes.

=== Philanthropy ===

After the 2010 Haiti earthquake, joining other celebrities in helping with the relief efforts, Travolta reportedly flew his Boeing 707 full of supplies, doctors, and Scientologist Volunteer Ministers into the disaster area.

==Personal life==
===Relationships and family===
Travolta was in a relationship with actress Diana Hyland, whom he met while filming &quot;The Boy in the Plastic Bubble&quot; (1976). They remained together until Hyland&#x27;s death from breast cancer on March 27, 1977. In 1980, Travolta dated French actress Catherine Deneuve. Travolta also had an on-again/off-again relationship with actress Marilu Henner, which ended permanently in 1985. In 1988 while filming &quot;The Experts&quot;, Travolta met actress Kelly Preston, whom he married in Paris in 1991. They had three children: Jett (1992–2009), Ella Bleu (born 2000), and Benjamin (born 2010). They regularly attended marriage counseling and Travolta has stated that therapy helped the marriage. They lived near Ocala, Florida.

On January 2, 2009, Jett died at age sixteen while on a Christmas vacation in The Bahamas. A Bahamian death certificate was issued, attributing the cause of death to a seizure. Jett, who had a history of seizures, reportedly had Kawasaki disease since the age of two. Travolta confirmed that Jett was autistic and had regular seizures, and immediately made his public statements while giving testimony at the trial of two defendants (a paramedic and a former Bahamas senator) who Travolta alleged tried to blackmail him with a multimillion-dollar extortion plot involving private information in connection with the death of his son Jett. After a mistrial, Travolta dropped the charges and has credited his immediate family and Scientology with helping him to cope with Jett&#x27;s death and move forward with his career. In memory of Jett, Travolta created the Jett Travolta Foundation, a nonprofit organization to help children with special needs. It has contributed to organizations such as the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy, Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential, and Simon Wiesenthal Center.

On July 12, 2020, Travolta&#x27;s wife, Kelly Preston, died at the age of 57, at their home in Clearwater, Florida, two years after she was diagnosed with breast cancer. Preston had undergone treatment at different hospitals, and at the time of her death, was receiving treatment at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas.

===Legal issues===
In May 2012, an anonymous masseur filed a lawsuit against Travolta, citing claims of sexual assault and battery. A lawyer for Travolta said that the allegations were &quot;complete fiction and fabrication&quot;. Travolta&#x27;s counsel also stated that his client would be able to prove that he was not in California on the day in question and asserted that Travolta would &quot;sue the attorney and Plaintiff for malicious prosecution&quot; after getting the case thrown out. A second masseur later joined the lawsuit, making similar claims. Both lawsuits were subsequently dropped by the complainants and dismissed without prejudice.

On September 27, 2012, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Malcolm Mackey dismissed a defamation lawsuit against Travolta and his attorney Marty Singer by writer Robert Randolph because he found that a letter, written by Singer in response to allegations in a book by Randolph, was protected by free speech.

<text>Saturday Night Fever is a 1977 American dance drama film directed by John Badham and produced by Robert Stigwood. It stars John Travolta as Tony Manero, a young Italian-American man who spends his weekends dancing and drinking at a local disco while dealing with social tensions and disillusionment in his working class ethnic neighborhood in Brooklyn. The story is based on &quot;Tribal Rites of the New Saturday Night&quot;, a mostly fictional 1976 &quot;New York&quot; article by music writer Nik Cohn.

A major critical and commercial success, &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; had a tremendous impact on the popular culture of the late 1970s. It helped popularize disco around the world and initiated a series of collaborations between film studios and record labels. It made Travolta, already well known from his role in the popular TV sitcom &quot;Welcome Back, Kotter&quot;, a household name. He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance, at the time becoming the fourth-youngest nominee in the category. The film showcases aspects of the music, dancing, and subculture surrounding the disco era, including symphony-orchestrated melodies, haute couture styles of clothing, pre-AIDS sexual promiscuity, and graceful choreography. The &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; soundtrack, featuring songs by the Bee Gees, is one of the best-selling soundtrack albums worldwide. Travolta reprised his role of Tony Manero in &quot;Staying Alive&quot; in 1983, which was panned by critics despite being successful at the box office.

In 2010, &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.

Adjusted for inflation, it is one of the highest-grossing R-rated films released in the U.S. in the 1970s, with a total box office gross of $673,899,098 in 2024.

==Plot==
Tony Manero is an Italian-American from the Bay Ridge neighborhood of Brooklyn, living in his family&#x27;s house and working in a hardware store. He escapes his day-to-day life by dancing at 2001 Odyssey, a local discotheque, where he receives the admiration he craves as king of the dance floor.

Tony and his friends Joey, Double J, Gus, and Bobby C spend their nights at the disco, trying to have sex with women in Bobby&#x27;s car, and climbing on the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge. Neighborhood girl Annette is infatuated with Tony, much to his annoyance, and he agrees to be her partner in an upcoming dance contest. Annette&#x27;s happiness is short-lived when Tony is mesmerized by a better dancer, Stephanie Mangano, who rejects Tony&#x27;s advances but eventually agrees to be his new partner in the competition.

Tony is pleased to no longer be the black sheep of the family when his older brother Frank Jr, the pride of their parents and grandmother, quits the Catholic priesthood. Frank Jr admits that he only became a priest to make their parents happy, and later advises Bobby, who is under pressure to marry his pregnant girlfriend, that the Pope is unlikely to grant him dispensation for an abortion. Leaving to start a new life, Frank encourages Tony to do what makes him happy.

Gus is beaten up and hospitalized, telling his friends that his attackers were the Barracudas, a Puerto Rican gang. Annette grows more and more desperate for Tony&#x27;s attention, as does Bobby, who tries to ask him for guidance. Tony helps Stephanie move to Manhattan, and comforts her after discovering her past relationship with an older married colleague. Tony and his friends take revenge on the Barracudas, crashing Bobby&#x27;s car into their hangout and starting a brawl, but are angry to learn that Gus may have identified the wrong gang.

After much practice, Tony and Stephanie dance at the competition, sharing a kiss at the end of their performance. They win first prize, but Tony believes that a Puerto Rican couple performed better and the judges&#x27; decision was racially biased, and he gives the couple his trophy and award money. Outside in Bobby&#x27;s car, Tony tries to force himself on Stephanie, who declares that she was only using him to win, before fighting him off and running away.

Tony&#x27;s friends arrive with an intoxicated Annette, who has agreed to have sex with everyone. Tony tries to lead her away but is subdued by Double J and Joey, and they all drive to the bridge as Joey and Annette have sex in the back seat. Double J takes Joey&#x27;s place and rapes Annette after she rescinds her consent, while Tony and Bobby appear uncomfortable. As the others begin their usual cable-climbing antics on the bridge, an erratic Bobby behaves even more recklessly than his friends, and Tony tries to talk him down, but Bobby&#x27;s strong sense of despair and Tony&#x27;s broken promise to call him earlier all lead to a suicidal tirade, before Bobby falls to his death. After the police arrive, a disgusted and disillusioned Tony leaves Double J, Joey, and Annette behind, riding the graffiti-riddled subway into Manhattan. By morning, he appears at Stephanie&#x27;s apartment and apologizes for his behavior, planning to relocate to Manhattan to start a new life. Stephanie forgives Tony, admitting that she danced with him because he gave her respect and moral support, and they salvage their relationship, agreeing to be friends.

==Production==
===Development===
The film was inspired by a 1976 &quot;New York&quot; magazine article entitled &quot;Tribal Rites of the New Saturday Night&quot; by British writer Nik Cohn. The article centers on working class Italian-Americans in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, and on the lives of young men who work dead-end jobs but live for their nights dancing at the local discotheque. Cohn later wrote that &quot;the [disco] craze had started in black gay clubs, then progressed to straight blacks and gay whites and from there to mass consumption—Latinos in the Bronx, West Indians on Staten Island, and, yes, Italians in Brooklyn.&quot; Shortly after Cohn&#x27;s article was published, British music impresario Robert Stigwood purchased the film rights and hired Cohn to adapt his own article to screen.

In the mid-1990s Cohn acknowledged that although his account was presented as factual reporting, he fabricated most of the article. He said that as a newcomer to the United States and a stranger to the disco lifestyle, he was unable to make any sense of the subculture he had been assigned to write about; instead, the article&#x27;s protagonist (who would become Tony Manero) was based on an acquaintance of Cohn who was an English mod.

John G. Avildsen was originally hired as the film&#x27;s director but was replaced one month before principal photography by John Badham over &quot;conceptual disagreements.&quot; Badham was a lesser-known director who, like his star, had mostly worked in television. His sole prior film credit, &quot;The Bingo Long Traveling All-Stars &amp; Motor Kings&quot;, was released while &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; was already well into production.

The film went through several different titles, including &quot;Tribal Rites of the New Saturday Night&quot; and &quot;Saturday Night&quot;. After the Bee Gees wrote &quot;Night Fever&quot; and submitted it for the soundtrack, they told Stigwood they disliked the title &quot;Saturday Night&quot;. It was after this that the film&#x27;s final title of &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; was decided upon.

===Writing=== 
After Cohn finished a single screenplay draft, he was replaced by Norman Wexler, a screenwriter with Oscar nominations for &quot;Joe&quot; (1970) and &quot;Serpico&quot; (1973). Among the elements Wexler added to the story was Tony&#x27;s younger sister, as well as older brother Frank who disappoints his parents by leaving the priesthood. &quot;I think what Norman did so well was to create a family situation that had real truth, an accurate look at how men related to women in that moment, in ways that you would never get away with now,&quot; said producer Kevin McCormick.

===Casting===
The film&#x27;s relatively low budget ($3.5 million) meant that most of the actors were relative unknowns, many of whom were recruited from New York&#x27;s theatre scene. For more than 40% of the actors it was their film debut. The only actor in the cast who was already an established name was John Travolta, thanks to his role on the sitcom &quot;Welcome Back, Kotter&quot;. Travolta, who had previously auditioned for Stigwood&#x27;s film version of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;, was remembered by the producer and signed to a three-movie contract with his company in 1976. Stigwood wanted Travolta to first star in a movie version of &quot;Grease&quot;, but because a film adaptation of &quot;Grease&quot; was not permitted to begin filming until 1978 when its stage run had completed, they made this film first. Travolta&#x27;s performance as Tony Manero brought him critical acclaim and helped launch him into international stardom.

Travolta researched the part by visiting the real 2001 Odyssey discotheque, and claimed he adopted many of the character&#x27;s swaggering mannerisms from the male patrons. Travolta said when he would get recognized, &quot;[Guys&#x27;] girlfriends would come up, and they&#x27;d say, &#x27;Hey, stay away from him, don&#x27;t bug Travolta,&#x27; and they’d actually push the girls away. Tony Manero&#x27;s whole male-chauvinist thing I got from watching those guys in the discos.&quot; He insisted on performing his character&#x27;s own dance sequences after producers suggested he be substituted by a body double, rehearsing his choreography with Lester Wilson and Deney Terrio for three hours every day, losing 20 pounds in the process. Wilson is credited for providing the look of the dance scenes and &quot;breathing life&quot; into the film. Said Travolta, &quot;He taught me what he called his &#x27;hang time.&#x27; He would smoke a cigarette to greet the day, and he infused my dancing with African-American rhythm. I&#x27;m the kind of dancer who needs thought and construction—an idea—before I dance. I need an internal story. Lester would put on some music and he would say, &#x27;Move with me, motherfucker—move with me!&#x27;&quot;

Karen Lynn Gorney was nine years older than Travolta when she was cast as his love interest Stephanie. Although Gorney had dance experience before she was cast, she found it difficult to keep up with her co-star due to injuries sustained in a motorcycle accident some years before. After the success of &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot;, Gorney took a break from film acting to work as a dance instructor at a performing arts academy in Brooklyn. Jessica Lange, Kathleen Quinlan, Carrie Fisher, and Amy Irving were all considered for the part before Gorney was cast.

Donna Pescow was considered almost &quot;too pretty&quot; by Paramount heads Michael Eisner and Jeffrey Katzenberg for the role of Annette. She corrected this matter by putting on weight. She also had to relearn her native Brooklyn accent, which she had overcome while studying drama at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts.

===Filming===
The film was shot entirely on location in Brooklyn, New York. The 2001 Odyssey Disco was a real club located at 802 64th Street, but it has since been demolished. The interior was modified for the film, including the addition of a $15,000 lighted floor, which was inspired by a Birmingham, Alabama establishment that Badham had visited. A similar effect was achieved on the club&#x27;s walls using tin foil and Christmas lights. Since the Bee Gees were not involved in the production until after principal photography had wrapped, the &quot;Night Fever&quot;, &quot;You Should Be Dancin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;More Than a Woman&quot; sequences were shot with Stevie Wonder tracks that were later overdubbed in the sound mix. During filming, the production was harassed by local gangs over use of the location, and was even firebombed.

The dance studio was Phillips Dance Studio in Bensonhurst, the Manero home was a house in Bay Ridge and the paint store was Pearson Paint &amp; Hardware, also in Bay Ridge. Other locations included the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, John J. Carty Park and the Bay Ridge Promenade.

To avoid Travolta&#x27;s fans who might disrupt filming, Badham and his team shot exterior scenes as early in the morning as possible, often at the break of dawn. The producers also generated fake call sheets. Badham was usually able to complete the scenes before significant crowds had time to gather.
==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack was released on November 15, 1977. Prior to the release of &quot;Thriller&quot; by Michael Jackson, &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; was the best-selling album in music history, and still ranks among the best-selling soundtrack albums worldwide, with sales figures of over 40 million copies.

In the United States, the album was certified 16× Platinum for shipments of at least 16 million units. The album stayed atop the charts for 24 straight weeks from January to July 1978 and stayed on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s album charts for 120 weeks until March 1980. The soundtrack included material written by the Bee Gees: &quot;How Deep Is Your Love&quot;, &quot;Stayin&#x27; Alive&quot; and &quot;Night Fever&quot;, which they also performed, as well as Yvonne Elliman&#x27;s version of &quot;If I Can&#x27;t Have You&quot;. All four reached No. 1 in the US. In the UK, the album spent 18 consecutive weeks at No. 1. The album epitomized the disco phenomenon on both sides of the Atlantic and was an international sensation. The album has been added to the National Recording Registry in the Library of Congress in 2014 for being culturally significant.

:The novelty songs &quot;Dr. Disco&quot; and &quot;Disco Duck&quot;, both performed by Rick Dees, are played in the film but not included on the album.

According to the DVD commentary for &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot;, the producers intended to use the song &quot;Lowdown&quot; by Boz Scaggs in the rehearsal scene between Tony and Annette in the dance studio, and choreographed their dance moves to the song. However, representatives for Scaggs&#x27; label Columbia Records refused to grant legal clearance for it, as they wanted to pursue another disco movie project, which never materialized. Composer David Shire, who scored the film, had to write a song to match the dance steps in the scene, replacing the Scaggs track. However, Shire&#x27;s track does not appear on the movie&#x27;s soundtrack.

The song &quot;K-Jee&quot; was used during the dance contest with the Puerto Rican couple that competed against Tony and Stephanie. Some VHS cassettes used a more traditional Latin-style song instead. The DVD restores the original recording.

The album, like its parent film, has been added to the Library of Congress via the National Recording Registry.

==Release==
===Theatrical===

Two theatrical versions of the film were released: the original R-rated version and an edited PG-rated version in 1979.

The R-rated version released in 1977 represented the movie&#x27;s first run, and totaled 119 minutes. After the success of the first run, the film&#x27;s content was re-edited into a 112-minute, toned down, PG-rated version, not only to attract a wider audience, but also to capitalize on attracting the target audience of the teenagers who were not old enough to see the film by themselves, but who made the film&#x27;s soundtrack album a monster hit. The R-rated version&#x27;s profanity, nudity, fight sequence, and a gang rape scene in a car, were all de-emphasized or removed from the PG version. Numerous profanity-filled scenes were replaced with alternate takes of the same scenes, substituting milder language initially intended for the network television cut.

Paramount initially intended to release the PG-rated version of the film in 1978, as it was already being screened on airlines. However, due to the regulations set by the MPAA at the time, it was not permissible to have two versions of a film with different ratings shown concurrently in American theaters. Consequently, Paramount had to remove the film from exhibition for a period of 90 days before they could showcase the alternate rated version, thereby causing a delay in their release plans. Eventually, in 1979, the PG-rated version was made available to the public. Paramount later decided to present it as a double feature along with their other successful John Travolta film, &quot;Grease&quot;. In the &quot;Biography&quot; documentary &quot;Inside Story: Saturday Night Fever&quot;, producer Robert Stigwood criticized the PG-rated version, stating that it undermined the film&#x27;s impact and lacked the power of the original R-rated edition.

In 2017, the director&#x27;s cut (running 122 minutes) premiered at the TCM Classic Film Festival at TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood. Fathom Events hosted special screenings of this version in 2017.

===Home media===
Both theatrical versions were released on VHS. The PG-rated version never had a home video release on Laserdisc. It was first released to DVD by Paramount on October 8, 2002, as an R-rated special-edition, which included most of the deleted scenes present on the PG version, as well as a director&#x27;s commentary and &quot;Behind the Music&quot; featurettes.

On May 5, 2009, Paramount released &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; on Blu-ray Disc in 1.78:1 aspect ratio. This release retains the R-rated version of the film, and included bonus features from the 2002 release as well as new extras.

The 4K director&#x27;s cut (122 minutes) was released on Blu-ray on May 2, 2017. This disc includes both the director&#x27;s cut and the original theatrical version, as well as the bulk of the bonus features from the prior release.

On November 8, 2022, Paramount released the film as a special edition 4K HD Blu-ray.

As of January 5, 2025, the TV version is officially available for streaming on YouTube.

===Television broadcast===
When HBO acquired the pay television rights to &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; in 1980, both versions of the film were aired by the network: the PG version during the day, and the R version during the evening (HBO, which had primarily operated on a late afternoon-to-early overnight schedule at the time, had maintained a programming policy restricting the showing of R-rated films to the nighttime hours, a rule that continued long after it switched to a 24-hour schedule full-time in December 1981). The R-rated theatrical version premiered on the network at midnight Eastern Time on January 1, 1980.

For the film&#x27;s network television premiere, airing on ABC on November 16, 1980, a new milder version was created to conform with network broadcast standards. The network television version was a slightly shortened cut of the PG-rated version. In order to maintain runtime, a few additional scenes deleted from both theatrical releases were added to make up for the lost/cut material, making the ABC version among the longest cuts of the film. These added scenes included Tony dancing with Doreen to &quot;Disco Duck&quot;, Tony running his finger along the cables of the Verrazzano–Narrows Bridge, and Tony&#x27;s father getting his job back. The last two deleted scenes were included in the 2017 director&#x27;s cut.

Starting in the late 1990s, VH1, TBS and TNT began showing the original R-rated version with a TV-14 rating, although with nudity removed/censored, and the stronger profanity either being edited or (on recent airings) silenced. However, this version of the TV cut included some innuendo included in the original theatrical release that was edited or removed from the PG version. Turner Classic Movies has aired the film in both versions: the original R-rated version (rated TV-MA on the network) is the cut commonly broadcast, although the PG cut has been presented as part of TCM&#x27;s family-oriented &quot;Funday Night at the Movies&quot; and &quot;Essentials Jr.&quot; film showcases.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film grossed $25.9 million in its first 24 days of release and grossed an average of $600,000 a day throughout January to March going on to gross $94.2 million in the United States and Canada and $237.1 million worldwide. Adjusted for inflation, it is the highest-grossing R-rated film released in the U.S. in the 1970s, with a total box office gross of $673,899,098 in 2024.

===Critical response===
&quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; received positive reviews and is regarded by many critics as one of the best films of 1977. It was added to &quot;The New York Times&quot; &quot;Guide to the Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made&quot;, which was published in 2004. In 2010, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

Film critic Gene Siskel, who would later list this as his favorite movie, praised the film: &quot;One minute into &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; you know this picture is onto something, that it knows what it&#x27;s talking about.&quot; He also praised John Travolta&#x27;s energetic performance: &quot;Travolta on the dance floor is like a peacock on amphetamines. He struts like crazy.&quot; Siskel even bought Travolta&#x27;s famous white suit from the film at a charity auction.

Film critic Pauline Kael wrote a gushing review of the film in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;: &quot;The way &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; has been directed and shot, we feel the languorous pull of the discotheque, and the gaudiness is transformed. These are among the most hypnotically beautiful pop dance scenes ever filmed ... Travolta gets so far inside the role he seems incapable of a false note; even the Brooklyn accent sounds unerring ... At its best, though, &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; gets at something deeply romantic: the need to move, to dance, and the need to be who you&#x27;d like to be. Nirvana is the dance; when the music stops, you return to being ordinary.&quot;

==In popular culture==

A television show based on the film was in development, at some point after the film&#x27;s release. In 2024, David Letterman said that he was sent to an audition for the series.

The 1980 comedy &quot;Airplane!&quot; by directors David &amp; Jerry Zucker and Jim Abrahams, included a flashback scene that directly parodied the dance competition scene at the disco in &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot;.

In 2008, director Pablo Larraín made a film, &quot;Tony Manero&quot;, about a Chilean dancer obsessed by the main character in &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; who tries to win a Tony Manero look-alike contest.

On April 17, 2012, Fox aired series &quot;Glee&quot;″s episode 16, &quot;Saturday Night Glee-ver&quot;, which pays tribute to the film and features various songs from its soundtrack (especially the songs performed by the Bee Gees), covered by the series&#x27; cast.

The Red Hot Chili Peppers 2016 music video for their song &quot;Go Robot&quot; is heavily inspired by the film and recreates the opening scene and classic characters from the film who are portrayed by each band member.

In &quot;Team Fortress 2&quot;, a community-created taunt for the spy in July 2016. The spy&#x27;s dance references Tony Monero&#x27;s dancing to &quot;You Should Be Dancin.&#x27;&quot;

The 2018 film &quot;Ready Player One&quot; features a dance scene that references &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot;, particularly the red, yellow, and blue dance floor from the 2001 Odyssey night club in the film.

In November 2023, Capital One began airing a holiday-themed commercial titled &quot;Holiday Night Fever&quot; which contained an homage to the opening scene of the movie. In the sixty second version, as the Bee Gees&#x27; &quot;Stayin&#x27; Alive&quot; plays over the scene, Santa Claus (a heavily made-up John Travolta) struts down a street that has been mostly cleared of snow after a winter storm. He carries a can of &quot;magical glitter paint&quot;; buys two cookies (instead of pizza slices) at a walk-up window and asks &quot;what happened to three?&quot; (he was offered three slices in the movie); eats them stacked; then pauses at a shoe store window and compares his shoes to a pair of elven boots with a jingle bell on them; he flirts with a store clerk (Donna Pescow); buys a disco ball Christmas ornament for his sleigh; throws some of the glitter paint onto a Christmas tree that is set up on the sidewalk; then goes to a disco where he asks how his hair looks and dances on the illuminated floor. The shorter version of the commercial was still being aired as of November 2024.

<text>The human body is the entire structure of a human being. It is composed of many different types of cells that together create tissues and subsequently organs and then organ systems. 

The external human body consists of a head, hair, neck, torso (which includes the thorax and abdomen), genitals, arms, hands, legs, and feet. The internal human body includes organs, teeth, bones, muscle, tendons, ligaments, blood vessels and blood, lymphatic vessels and lymph.

The study of the human body includes anatomy, physiology, histology and embryology. The body varies anatomically in known ways. Physiology focuses on the systems and organs of the human body and their functions. Many systems and mechanisms interact in order to maintain homeostasis, with safe levels of substances such as sugar, iron, and oxygen in the blood.

The body is studied by health professionals, physiologists, anatomists, and artists to assist them in their work.

==Composition==

The human body is composed of elements including hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, calcium and phosphorus. These elements reside in trillions of cells and non-cellular components of the body.

The adult male body is about 60% total body water content of some . This is made up of about of extracellular fluid including about of blood plasma and about of interstitial fluid, and about of fluid inside cells. The content, acidity and composition of the water inside and outside cells is carefully maintained. The main electrolytes in body water outside cells are sodium and chloride, whereas within cells it is potassium and other phosphates.

===Cells===

The body contains trillions of cells, the fundamental unit of life. At maturity, there are roughly 30 trillion cells, and 38 trillion bacteria in the body, an estimate arrived at by totaling the cell numbers of all the organs of the body and cell types. The skin of the body is also host to billions of commensal organisms as well as immune cells. Not all parts of the body are made from cells. Cells sit in an extracellular matrix that consists of proteins such as collagen, surrounded by extracellular fluids. 

====Genome====

Cells in the body function because of DNA. DNA sits within the nucleus of a cell. Here, parts of DNA are copied and sent to the body of the cell via RNA. The RNA is then used to create proteins, which form the basis for cells, their activity, and their products. Proteins dictate cell function and gene expression, a cell is able to self-regulate by the amount of proteins produced. However, not all cells have DNA; some cells such as mature red blood cells lose their nucleus as they mature.

===Tissues===

The body consists of many different types of tissue, defined as cells that act with a specialised function. The study of tissues is called histology and is often done with a microscope. The body consists of four main types of tissues. These are lining cells (epithelia), connective tissue, nerve tissue and muscle tissue.

====Cells====
Cells that line surfaces exposed to the outside world or gastrointestinal tract (epithelia) or internal cavities (endothelium) come in numerous shapes and forms – from single layers of flat cells, to cells with small beating hair-like cilia in the lungs, to column-like cells that line the stomach. Endothelial cells are cells that line internal cavities including blood vessels and glands. Lining cells regulate what can and cannot pass through them, protect internal structures, and function as sensory surfaces.

===Organs===

Organs, structured collections of cells with a specific function, mostly sit within the body, with the exception of skin. Examples include the heart, lungs and liver. Many organs reside within cavities within the body. These cavities include the abdomen (which contains the stomach, for example) and pleura, which contains the lungs.

==== Heart ====

The heart is an organ located in the thoracic cavity between the lungs and slightly to the left. It is surrounded by the pericardium, which holds it in place in the mediastinum and serves to protect it from blunt trauma, infection and help lubricate the movement of the heart via pericardial fluid. The heart works by pumping blood around the body allowing oxygen, nutrients, waste, hormones and white blood cells to be transported.

The heart is composed of two atria and two ventricles. The primary purpose of the atria is to allow uninterrupted venous blood flow to the heart during ventricular systole. This allows enough blood to get into the ventricles during atrial systole. Consequently, the atria allows a cardiac output roughly 75% greater than would be possible without them. The purpose of the ventricles is to pump blood to the lungs through the right ventricle and to the rest of the body through the left ventricle.

The heart has an electrical conduction system to control the contraction and relaxation of the muscles. It starts in the sinoatrial node traveling through the atria causing them to pump blood into the ventricles. It then travels to the atrioventricular node, which makes the signal slow down slightly allowing the ventricles to fill with blood before pumping it out and starting the cycle over again.

Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death worldwide, making up 16% of all deaths. It is caused by the buildup of plaque in the coronary arteries supplying the heart, eventually the arteries may become so narrow that not enough blood is able to reach the myocardium, a condition known as myocardial infarction or heart attack, this can cause heart failure or cardiac arrest and eventually death. Risk factors for coronary artery disease include obesity, smoking, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, lack of exercise and diabetes. Cancer can affect the heart, though it is exceedingly rare and has usually metastasized from another part of the body such as the lungs or breasts. This is because the heart cells quickly stop dividing and all growth occurs through size increase rather than cell division.

==== Gallbladder ====
The gallbladder is a hollow pear-shaped organ located posterior to the inferior middle part of the right lobe of the liver. It is variable in shape and size. It stores bile before it is released into the small intestine via the common bile duct to help with digestion of fats. It receives bile from the liver via the cystic duct, which connects to the common hepatic duct to form the common bile duct.

The gallbladder gets its blood supply from the cystic artery, which in most people, emerges from the right hepatic artery.

Gallstones is a common disease in which one or more stones form in the gallbladder or biliary tract. Most people are asymptomatic but if a stone blocks the biliary tract, it causes a gallbladder attack, symptoms may include sudden pain in the upper right abdomen or center of the abdomen. Nausea and vomiting may also occur. Typical treatment is removal of the gallbladder through a procedure called a cholecystectomy. Having gallstones is a risk factor for gallbladder cancer, which although quite uncommon, is rapidly fatal if not diagnosed early.

===Systems===
==== Circulatory system ====
The circulatory system consists of the heart and blood vessels (arteries, veins and capillaries). The heart propels the circulation of the blood, which serves as a &quot;transportation system&quot; to transfer oxygen, fuel, nutrients, waste products, immune cells and signaling molecules (i.e. hormones) from one part of the body to another. Paths of blood circulation within the human body can be divided into two circuits: the pulmonary circuit, which pumps blood to the lungs to receive oxygen and leave carbon dioxide, and the systemic circuit, which carries blood from the heart off to the rest of the body. The blood consists of fluid that carries cells in the circulation, including some that move from tissue to blood vessels and back, as well as the spleen and bone marrow.

==== Digestive system ====
The digestive system consists of the mouth including the tongue and teeth, esophagus, stomach, (gastrointestinal tract, small and large intestines, and rectum), as well as the liver, pancreas, gallbladder, and salivary glands. It converts food into small, nutritional, non-toxic molecules for distribution and absorption into the body. These molecules take the form of proteins (which are broken down into amino acids), fats, vitamins and minerals (the last of which are mainly ionic rather than molecular). After being swallowed, food moves through the gastrointestinal tract by means of peristalsis: the systematic expansion and contraction of muscles to push food from one area to the next.

Digestion begins in the mouth, which chews food into smaller pieces for easier digestion. Then it is swallowed, and moves through the esophagus to the stomach. In the stomach, food is mixed with gastric acids to allow the extraction of nutrients. What is left is called chyme; this then moves into the small intestine, which absorbs the nutrients and water from the chyme. What remains passes on to the large intestine, where it is dried to form feces; these are then stored in the rectum until they are expelled through the anus.

==== Endocrine system ====
The endocrine system consists of the principal endocrine glands: the pituitary, thyroid, adrenals, pancreas, parathyroids, and gonads, but nearly all organs and tissues produce specific endocrine hormones as well. The endocrine hormones serve as signals from one body system to another regarding an enormous array of conditions, resulting in variety of changes of function.

==== Immune system ====
The immune system consists of the white blood cells, the thymus, lymph nodes and lymph channels, which are also part of the lymphatic system. The immune system provides a mechanism for the body to distinguish its own cells and tissues from outside cells and substances and to neutralize or destroy the latter by using specialized proteins such as antibodies, cytokines, and toll-like receptors, among many others.
==== Integumentary system ====
The integumentary system consists of the covering of the body (the skin), including hair and nails as well as other functionally important structures such as the sweat glands and sebaceous glands. The skin provides containment, structure, and protection for other organs, and serves as a major sensory interface with the outside world.

==== Lymphatic system ====
The lymphatic system extracts, transports and metabolizes lymph, the fluid found in between cells. The lymphatic system is similar to the circulatory system in terms of both its structure and its most basic function, to carry a body fluid.

==== Musculoskeletal system ====
The musculoskeletal system consists of the human skeleton (which includes bones, ligaments, tendons, joints and cartilage) and attached muscles. It gives the body basic structure and the ability for movement. In addition to their structural role, the larger bones in the body contain bone marrow, the site of production of blood cells. Also, all bones are major storage sites for calcium and phosphate. This system can be split up into the muscular system and the skeletal system.

==== Nervous system ====

The nervous system consists of the body&#x27;s neurons and glial cells, which together form the nerves, ganglia and gray matter, which in turn form the brain and related structures. The brain is the organ of thought, emotion, memory, and sensory processing; it serves many aspects of communication and controls various systems and functions. The special senses consist of vision, hearing, taste, and smell. The eyes, ears, tongue, and nose gather information about the body&#x27;s environment.

From a structural perspective, the nervous system is typically subdivided into two component parts: the central nervous system (CNS), composed of the brain and the spinal cord; and the peripheral nervous system (PNS), composed of the nerves and ganglia outside the brain and spinal cord. The CNS is mostly responsible for organizing motion, processing sensory information, thought, memory, cognition and other such functions. It remains a matter of some debate whether the CNS directly gives rise to consciousness. The peripheral nervous system (PNS) is mostly responsible for gathering information with sensory neurons and directing body movements with motor neurons.

From a functional perspective, the nervous system is again typically divided into two component parts: the somatic nervous system (SNS) and the autonomic nervous system (ANS). The SNS is involved in voluntary functions like speaking and sensory processes. The ANS is involved in involuntary processes, such as digestion and regulating blood pressure.

The nervous system is subject to many different diseases. In epilepsy, abnormal electrical activity in the brain can cause seizures. In multiple sclerosis, the immune system attacks the nerve linings, damaging the nerves&#x27; ability to transmit signals. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig&#x27;s disease, is a motor neuron disease which gradually reduces movement in patients. There are also many other diseases of the nervous system.

==== Reproductive system ====
The purpose of the reproductive system is to reproduce and nurture the growth of offspring. The functions include the production of germ cells and hormones. The sex organs of the male reproductive system and the female reproductive system develops and mature at puberty. These systems include the internal and external genitalia.
Female puberty generally occurs between the ages of 9 and 13 and is characterized by ovulation and menstruation; the growth of secondary sex characteristics, such as growth of pubic and underarm hair, breast, uterine and vaginal growth, widening hips and increased height and weight, also occur during puberty. Male puberty sees the further development of the penis and testicles.

The female inner sex organs are the two ovaries, their fallopian tubes, the uterus, and the cervix. At birth there are about 70,000 immature egg cells that degenerate until at puberty there are around 40,000. No more egg cells are produced. Hormones stimulate the beginning of menstruation, and the ongoing menstrual cycles. The female external sex organs are the vulva (labia, clitoris, and vestibule).

The male external genitalia include the penis and scrotum that contains the testicles. The testicle is the gonad, the sex gland that produces the sperm cells. Unlike the egg cells in the female, sperm cells are produced throughout life. Other internal sex organs are the epididymides, vasa deferentia, and some accessory glands.

Diseases that affect the reproductive system include polycystic ovary syndrome, a number of disorders of the testicles including testicular torsion, and a number of sexually transmitted infections including syphilis, HIV, chlamydia, HPV and genital warts. Cancer can affect most parts of the reproductive system including the penis, testicles, prostate, ovaries, cervix, vagina, fallopian, uterus and vulva.

==== Respiratory system ====
The respiratory system consists of the nose, nasopharynx, trachea, and lungs. It brings oxygen from the air and excretes carbon dioxide and water back into the air. First, air is pulled through the trachea into the lungs by the diaphragm pushing down, which creates a vacuum. Air is briefly stored inside small sacs known as alveoli (sing.: alveolus) before being expelled from the lungs when the diaphragm contracts again. Each alveolus is surrounded by capillaries carrying deoxygenated blood, which absorbs oxygen out of the air and into the bloodstream.

For the respiratory system to function properly, there need to be as few impediments as possible to the movement of air within the lungs. Inflammation of the lungs and excess mucus are common sources of breathing difficulties. In asthma, the respiratory system is persistently inflamed, causing wheezing or shortness of breath. Pneumonia occurs through infection of the alveoli, and may be caused by tuberculosis. Emphysema, commonly a result of smoking, is caused by damage to connections between the alveoli.

==== Urinary system ====
The urinary system consists of the two kidneys, two ureters, bladder, and urethra. It removes waste materials from the blood through urine, which carries a variety of waste molecules and excess ions and water out of the body.

First, the kidneys filter the blood through their respective nephrons, removing waste products like urea, creatinine and maintaining the proper balance of electrolytes and turning the waste products into urine by combining them with water from the blood. The kidneys filter about 150 quarts (170 liters) of blood daily, but most of it is returned to the blood stream with only 1-2 quarts (1-2 liters) ending up as urine. The urine is brought by the ureters from the kidneys down to the bladder.

The smooth muscle lining the ureter walls continuously tighten and relax through a process called peristalsis to force urine away from the kidneys and down into the bladder. Small amounts of urine are released into the bladder every 10–15 seconds.

The bladder is a hollow balloon shaped organ located in the pelvis. It stores urine until the brain signals it to relax the urinary sphincter and release the urine into the urethra starting urination. A normal bladder can hold up to 16 ounces (half a liter) for 3–5 hours comfortably.

Numerous diseases affect the urinary system including kidney stones, which are formed when materials in the urine concentrate enough to form a solid mass, urinary tract infections, which are infections of the urinary tract and can cause pain when urinating, frequent urination and even death if left untreated. Renal failure occurs when the kidneys fail to adequately filter waste from the blood and can lead to death if not treated with dialysis or kidney transplantation. Cancer can affect the bladder, kidneys, urethra and ureters, with the latter two being far more rare.

==Anatomy==

Human anatomy is the study of the shape and form of the human body. The human body has four limbs (two arms and two legs), a head and a neck, which connect to the torso. The body&#x27;s shape is determined by a strong skeleton made of bone and cartilage, surrounded by fat (adipose tissue), muscle, connective tissue, organs, and other structures. The spine at the back of the skeleton contains the flexible vertebral column, which surrounds the spinal cord, which is a collection of nerve fibres connecting the brain to the rest of the body. Nerves connect the spinal cord and brain to the rest of the body. All major bones, muscles, and nerves in the body are named, with the exception of anatomical variations such as sesamoid bones and accessory muscles.

Blood vessels carry blood throughout the body, which moves because of the beating of the heart. Venules and veins collect blood low in oxygen from tissues throughout the body. These collect in progressively larger veins until they reach the body&#x27;s two largest veins, the superior and inferior vena cava, which drain blood into the right side of the heart. From here, the blood is pumped into the lungs where it receives oxygen and drains back into the left side of the heart. From here, it is pumped into the body&#x27;s largest artery, the aorta, and then progressively smaller arteries and arterioles until it reaches tissue. Here, blood passes from small arteries into capillaries, then small veins and the process begins again. Blood carries oxygen, waste products, and hormones from one place in the body to another. Blood is filtered at the kidneys and liver.

The body consists of a number of body cavities, separated areas which house different organ systems. The brain and central nervous system reside in an area protected from the rest of the body by the blood brain barrier. The lungs sit in the pleural cavity. The intestines, liver, and spleen sit in the abdominal cavity.

Height, weight, shape and other body proportions vary individually and with age and sex. Body shape is influenced by the distribution of bones, muscle and fat tissue.

==Physiology==
Human physiology is the study of how the human body functions. This includes the mechanical, physical, bioelectrical, and biochemical functions of humans in good health, from organs to the cells of which they are composed. The human body consists of many interacting systems of organs. These interact to maintain homeostasis, keeping the body in a stable state with safe levels of substances such as sugar and oxygen in the blood.

Each system contributes to homeostasis, of itself, other systems, and the entire body. Some combined systems are referred to by joint names. For example, the nervous system and the endocrine system operate together as the neuroendocrine system. The nervous system receives information from the body, and transmits this to the brain via nerve impulses and neurotransmitters. At the same time, the endocrine system releases hormones, such as to help regulate blood pressure and volume. Together, these systems regulate the internal environment of the body, maintaining blood flow, posture, energy supply, temperature, and acid balance (pH).

==Development==

Development of the human body is the process of growth to maturity. The process begins with fertilisation, where an egg released from the ovary of a female is penetrated by sperm. The egg then lodges in the uterus, where an embryo and later fetus develop until birth. Growth and development occur after birth, and include both physical and psychological development, influenced by genetic, hormonal, environmental and other factors. Development and growth continue throughout life, through childhood, adolescence, and through adulthood to old age, and are referred to as the process of aging.

==Society and culture==
===Professional study===

Health professionals learn about the human body from illustrations, models, and demonstrations. Medical and dental students in addition gain practical experience, for example by dissection of cadavers. Human anatomy, physiology, and biochemistry are basic medical sciences, generally taught to medical students in their first year at medical school.

===Depiction===

In Western societies, the contexts for depictions of the human body include information, art and pornography. Information includes both science and education, such as anatomical drawings. Any ambiguous image not easily fitting into one of these categories may be misinterpreted, leading to disputes. The most contentious disputes are between fine art and erotic images, which define the legal distinction of which images are permitted or prohibited.

===History of anatomy===

In Ancient Greece, the &quot;Hippocratic Corpus&quot; described the anatomy of the skeleton and muscles. The 2nd century physician Galen of Pergamum compiled classical knowledge of anatomy into a text that was used throughout the Middle Ages. In the Renaissance, Andreas Vesalius (1514–1564) pioneered the modern study of human anatomy by dissection, writing the influential book &quot;De humani corporis fabrica&quot;. Anatomy advanced further with the invention of the microscope and the study of the cellular structure of tissues and organs. Modern anatomy uses techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, fluoroscopy and ultrasound imaging to study the body in unprecedented detail.

===History of physiology===
The study of human physiology began with Hippocrates in Ancient Greece, around 420 BCE, and with Aristotle (384–322 BCE) who applied critical thinking and emphasis on the relationship between structure and function. Galen () was the first to use experiments to probe the body&#x27;s functions. The term physiology was introduced by the French physician Jean Fernel (1497–1558). In the 17th century, William Harvey (1578–1657) described the circulatory system, pioneering the combination of close observation with careful experiment. In the 19th century, physiological knowledge began to accumulate at a rapid rate with the cell theory of Matthias Schleiden and Theodor Schwann in 1838, that organisms are made up of cells. Claude Bernard (1813–1878) created the concept of the &quot;milieu interieur&quot; (internal environment), which Walter Cannon (1871–1945) later said was regulated to a steady state in homeostasis. In the 20th century, the physiologists Knut Schmidt-Nielsen and George Bartholomew extended their studies to comparative physiology and ecophysiology. Most recently, evolutionary physiology has become a distinct subdiscipline.

<text>The Miller Brewing Company is an American brewery and beer company in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. It was founded in 1855 by Frederick Miller. Molson Coors acquired the full global brand portfolio of Miller Brewing Company in 2016, and operates the Miller Brewery at the site of the original Miller Brewing Company complex.

==History==
Miller Brewing Company was founded in Milwaukee in 1855 by Frederick Miller after his emigration from Hohenzollern, Germany, in 1854 with a unique brewer&#x27;s yeast. Initially, he purchased the small Plank Road Brewery for $2,300 ($82,280 in 2024). The brewery&#x27;s location in what is now the Miller Valley provided easy access to raw materials produced on nearby farms. In 1855, Miller changed its name to Miller Brewing Company, Inc. The enterprise remained in the family until 1966.

The company was one of six breweries affected by the 1953 Milwaukee brewery strike. In 1961, Miller purchased the smallest of the &quot;Big Five&quot; Milwaukee brewers, A. Gettelman Brewing Company.

In 1966, the conglomerate W. R. Grace and Company bought Miller from Lorraine John Mulberger (Frederick Miller&#x27;s granddaughter, who objected to alcohol) and her family. In 1969, Philip Morris (now Altria) bought Miller from W. R. Grace for $130 million, outbidding PepsiCo.

In 1999, Miller acquired the Hamm&#x27;s brand from Pabst.

In 2002, South African Breweries bought Miller from Philip Morris for $3.6 billion worth of stock and $2 billion in debt to form SABMiller, with Philip Morris retaining a 36% ownership share and 24.99% voting rights.

In 2006, SABMiller purchased the Sparks and Steel Reserve brands from McKenzie River Corporation for $215 million. Miller had been producing both brands prior to the purchase.

On July 1, 2008, SABMiller formed MillerCoors, a joint venture with rival Molson Coors, to consolidate the production and distribution of its products in the United States, with each parent company&#x27;s corporate operations and international operations to remain separate and independent of the joint venture. SABMiller owned 58% of the unit, which operated in the United States but not in Canada, where Molson Coors is strongest, but the companies had equal voting power.

===Sole ownership by Molson Coors===
In September 2015, Anheuser-Busch InBev announced it had reached a full agreement to acquire SABMiller for $107 billion. As part of the agreement with the U.S. Justice Department, SABMiller divested itself of the Miller brands in the U.S. by selling its stake in MillerCoors to Molson Coors. Consequently, on October 11, 2016, SABMiller in the U.S. sold its interests in MillerCoors to Molson Coors for around US $12 billion. Molson Coors gained full ownership of the Miller brand portfolio outside the US, and retained the rights within the U.S. (including Puerto Rico).

==Brands==

Brands with the Miller name, or historically sold by Miller Brewing company, include:

*&quot;&quot;: An American-style lager introduced in 1903, High Life is Miller Brewing&#x27;s oldest brand and is 4.6% abv. It is noted for its high level of carbonation, like champagne, leading to its longtime slogan &quot;The Champagne of Beers&quot;. It was one of the premier high-end beers in the US for many years. High Life bottles feature a bright gold label and are made of a clear glass that has a tapered neck like a champagne bottle. The label includes the &quot;Girl in the Moon&quot; logo, which features a woman in a circus costume seated on a crescent moon. The brand helped popularize pony bottles, introduced in 1972. 
*&quot;Miller Lite&quot;: An American-style light lager. Introduced in 1972, it was the first light beer to see wide popularity. It is 4.2% abv (4% in Canada). 
*&quot;Miller High Life Light&quot;: Introduced in 1994, it had 4.1% abv. It was discontinued in 2021 to focus on Miller Lite, but brought back in 2024.
*&quot;Miller Genuine Draft&quot;: Nicknamed MGD, it was introduced in 1985 as &quot;Miller High Life Genuine Draft&quot;. Developed to replicate the flavor of High Life from a non-pasteurized keg in a can or bottle, MGD is made from the same recipe as &quot;High Life&quot; but the beer is cold filtered instead of pasteurized. As of 2007 Genuine Draft had a 1.5% share of the United States market; by 2012 it had declined to 0.7% market share, representing a decline of 1.7 million barrels. It has 4.7% abv.
*&quot;Miller 64&quot;: (Formerly &quot;Miller Genuine Draft 64&quot;) An &quot;ultra light&quot; beer with 2.8% abv, it contains . Miller launched this beer in the summer of 2007 in Madison, Wisconsin. It was received favorably and testing expanded to Arizona, San Diego and Sacramento.
*&quot;Frederick Miller Classic Chocolate Lager&quot;: A seasonal lager available from October to December in Wisconsin, Chicago, Minneapolis, Cleveland, Indianapolis and northwest Indiana. It is brewed with six different malts, including chocolate and dark chocolate malts.
*&quot;Miller Sharp&#x27;s&quot;: A non-alcoholic beer introduced in 1989.

===Economy brands===
*&quot;Milwaukee&#x27;s Best&quot;: Miller&#x27;s economy label. It is 4.8% abv.
*&quot;Milwaukee&#x27;s Best Light&quot;: Light version of Milwaukee&#x27;s Best. It is 4.1% abv.
*&quot;Milwaukee&#x27;s Best Ice&quot;: Miller&#x27;s economy ice beer. It is 5.9% abv.

===Malt liquor===
*&quot;Mickey&#x27;s&quot;: Mickey&#x27;s is a malt liquor that is 5.6% abv.
*&quot;Olde English 800&quot;: Malt liquor also known as &quot;OE&quot;. It is 5.9% abv in the eastern United States, 7.5% abv in most western U.S. states and 8.0% abv in Canada.

===Discontinued===
*&quot;Miller Chill&quot;: A chelada-style 4.2% abv pale lager brewed with lime and salt. Introduced successfully in 2007, sales dropped in 2008 after the launch of the rival &quot;Bud Light Lime&quot;. In response, MillerCoors revamped their recipe from a &#x27;chelada&#x27; style brew to a light beer with lime, created new packaging which included switching from a green to a clear bottle, and launched a new advertising campaign centered around the slogan &quot;How a Light Beer with a Taste of Lime Should Taste&quot;. It was discontinued in 2013.

==Sponsorships==
Miller has been a large motorsport sponsor since the 1980s. In the CART World Series, the company has sponsored drivers such as Al Unser (1984), Danny Sullivan (1985–1989, 1991), Roberto Guerrero (1990), Bobby Rahal (1992–1998) and Kenny Bräck (2003). It also sponsored the Miller 200 race at Mid-Ohio.

In 1997, Miller Brewing Company, under its Miller Lite brand, sponsored a car in the Indy Racing League, specifically for the Indianapolis 500. The car was driven by Arie Luyendyk. This sponsorship was significant as Luyendyk won the 1997 Indianapolis 500.

In the NASCAR Cup Series, Miller has sponsored Bobby Allison from 1983 to 1988, Dick Trickle in 1989, Rusty Wallace from 1990 to 2005, Kurt Busch from 2006 to 2010, and Brad Keselowski from 2011 to 2020. Allison won the 1983 NASCAR Winston Cup Series, and Keselowski won the 2012 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series. The company has sponsored the Miller High Life 500, Miller 500, Miller High Life 400, Miller 400, Miller 300, Miller 200, and Miller 150 races.

In the NHRA, Miller sponsored Larry Dixon for 11 years until 2007.

From its opening in 2001 until the end of 2020, Miller owned the naming rights to Miller Park, home of the Milwaukee Brewers when the naming rights were bought by American Family Insurance in 2019.

<doc id="54180" wikidata="Q392163" url="?curid=54180" title="LocalTalk">
<text>LocalTalk is a particular implementation of the physical layer of the AppleTalk networking system from Apple Computer. 

LocalTalk specifies a system of shielded twisted pair cabling, plugged into self-terminating transceivers, running at a rate of 230.4 kbit/s. CSMA/CA was implemented as a random multiple access method.

Networking was envisioned in the Macintosh during planning, so the Mac was given expensive RS-422 capable serial ports, first on a nine-pin D-connector, then on a mini-DIN-8 connector. The ports were driven by the Zilog SCC, which could serve as either a standard UART or handle the much more complicated HDLC protocol, which was a packet oriented protocol that incorporated addressing, bit-stuffing, and packet checksumming in hardware. Coupled together with the RS422 electrical connections, this provided a reasonably-high-speed data connection.

The 230.4 kbit/s bit rate is the highest in the series of standard serial bit rates (110, 150, 300, 600, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 14400, 19200, 28800, 38400, 57600, 115200, 230400) derived from the 3.6864 MHz clock after the customary divide-by-16. This clock frequency, 3.6864 MHz, was chosen (in part) to support the common asynchronous baud rates up to 38.4 kbit/s using the SCC&#x27;s internal baud-rate generator. When the SCC&#x27;s internal PLL was used to lock to the clock embedded in the LocalTalk serial data stream (using its FM0 encoding method) a divide-by-16 setting on the PLL yielded the fastest rate available, namely 230.4 kbit/s.

Originally released as &quot;AppleTalk Personal Network&quot;, LocalTalk used shielded twisted-pair cable with three-pin mini-DIN connectors. Cables were daisy-chained from transceiver to transceiver. Each transceiver had two three-pin mini-DIN ports, and a &quot;pigtail&quot; cable to connect to the Mac&#x27;s DE-9 serial connector. Later, when the Mac Plus introduced the eight-pin mini-DIN serial connector, transceivers were updated as well.

A variation of LocalTalk called PhoneNET was introduced by Farallon Computing. It used standard unshielded side-by-side telephone wire, with six-position modular connectors (same as the popular RJ11 telephone connectors) connected to a PhoneNET transceiver, instead of the expensive, shielded, twisted-pair cable. In addition to being lower cost, PhoneNET-wired networks were more reliable due to the connections being more difficult to accidentally disconnect. In addition, because it used the &quot;outer&quot; pair of the modular connector, it could travel on many pre-existing phone cables and jacks where just the inner pair was in use for RJ11 telephone service. PhoneNET was also able to use an office&#x27;s existing phone wire, allowing for entire floors of computers to be easily networked. Farallon introduced a 12-port hub, which made constructing star topology networks of up to 48 devices as easy as adding jacks at the workstations and some jumpers in the phone closet. These factors led to PhoneNET largely supplanting LocalTalk wiring in low-cost networking.

The useful life of PhoneNET was extended with the introduction of LocalTalk switching technology by Tribe Computer Works. Introduced in 1990, the Tribe LocalSwitch was a 16-port packet switch designed to speed up overloaded PhoneNET networks.

The widespread availability of Ethernet-based networking in the early 1990s led to the swift disappearance of both LocalTalk and PhoneNET. They remained in use for some time in low-cost applications and applications where Ethernet was not used. Macintosh Quadra and early models of Power Macintosh supported both 10BASE2 and 10BASE-T via the Apple Attachment Unit Interface (AAUI), and all other Ethernet media via an AAUI–AUI adapter, while still supporting LocalTalk-based networking. For older Macintosh computers that did not have built-in Ethernet, a high-speed SCSI-to-Ethernet adapter was available, and was particularly popular on PowerBooks. This enabled all but the earliest Macintosh models to access a high-speed Ethernet network.

With the release of the iMac in 1998 the traditional Mac serial port—and thus, the ability to use both LocalTalk and PhoneNET—disappeared from new models of Macintosh. LocalTalk-to-Ethernet bridges were introduced to allow legacy devices (especially printers) to function on newer networks. For very old Macintosh computers, LocalTalk remains the only option.

The LocalTalk connector had the distinction of being the first to use Apple&#x27;s unified AppleTalk Connector Family design, created by Brad Bissell of Frog Design using Rick Meadows&#x27; Apple Icon Family designs. LocalTalk connectors were first released in January 1985 to connect the LaserWriter printer initially with the Macintosh family of computers as an integral part of the newly announced Macintosh Office. However, well past the move to Ethernet, the connector&#x27;s design continued to be used on all of Apple&#x27;s peripherals and cable connectors as well as influencing the connectors used throughout the industry as a whole.

<text>In baseball, a catcher is charged with a passed ball when he fails to hold or control a legally pitched ball that, with ordinary effort, should have been maintained under his control, and, as a result of this loss of control, the batter or a runner on base advances. A runner who advances due to a passed ball is not credited with a stolen base unless he breaks for the base before the pitcher begins his delivery.

==History==
A passed ball may be scored when a base runner reaches the next base on a bobble or missed catch by the catcher, or when the batter–runner reaches first base on an uncaught strike three (&quot;see also&quot; Strikeout).

A closely related statistic is the wild pitch. As with many baseball statistics, whether a pitch that gets away from a catcher is a passed ball or wild pitch is at the discretion of the official scorer. Typically, pitches that are deemed to be ordinarily catchable by the catcher, but are not, are ruled passed balls; pitches that get by the catcher that are thought to have required extraordinary effort by the catcher in order to stop them are wild pitches. If the pitch was so low as to touch the ground, or so high that the catcher has to rise out of his crouched position to get to it, or so wide that the catcher has to lunge for it, it is usually then considered a wild pitch and not a passed ball.

A run scored due to a passed ball is not recorded as an earned run. However, a run scored due to a wild pitch is recorded as an earned run.

Passed balls and wild pitches are considered to be part of the act of pitching rather than fielding. Thus they are kept as separate statistics and are not recorded as errors.

There tends to be a higher incidence of passed balls when a knuckleballer is pitching. The physics that make a knuckleball so difficult to hit make it similarly difficult to catch. While teams with a knuckleballer on their pitching staff often employ a special &quot;knuckleball catcher&quot; who is equipped with a knuckleball mitt, similar to a first baseman&#x27;s glove, it is still extremely difficult to catch.

==Records==

The MLB career record for passed balls allowed is 763 by Pop Snyder, while Rudy Kemmler set the single season record of 114 in 1883. The single season record in the modern era is 35, set by Geno Petralli in 1987. The record for passed balls in a single game, six, was set by Rube Vickers in 1902 and later tied by Petralli in 1987 and Jerry Goff in 1996. The record for passed balls in a single inning is four, and is jointly held by Petralli, Ray Katt, and Ryan Lavarnway, all three of whom were catching knuckleball pitchers (Charlie Hough, Hoyt Wilhelm, and Steven Wright, respectively).

<text>The Pudelpointer is a versatile hunting dog breed from Germany. It is a pointing breed that came from a cross between the German hunting poodle (pudel) and the English Pointer.

== Appearance ==
The breed weighs between , stands at the shoulder, and comes in liver, chestnut, and occasionally black coats. The ideal coat is harsh, wiry, and dense. The dogs shed very little.

== History ==
In 1881, a German breeder, Baron &#x27;Hegewald&#x27; von Zedlitz, worked on producing his ideal tracking, pointing, and retrieving gun dog, suitable for work on both land and water. From seven water Poodles and 90 different pointers, he developed the Pudelpointer. The original sire was Tell, an English Pointer belonging to Kaiser Frederick III and the original dam was a German hunting pudel named Molly who was owned by Hegewald.

The goal was to produce a dog that was willing and easy to train, intelligent, and loved water and retrieving, like the poodle, and add to that a great desire to hunt, a strong pointing instinct, and an excellent nose, like in the English Pointer, as well as being an excellent companion in the home.

The Poodle breed had much stronger genes, and so many more Pointers were used to achieve the balanced hunting dog that was desired. A mix of 11 Pudels and 80 Pointers were used during the first 30 years to achieve the desired traits and results.

The breed was introduced to North America in 1956 by Bodo Winterhelt, who remained involved in maintaining the breed standard until his death in 2018. His Winterhelle Kennel was the foundation of the breed in North America. In 1977 Winterhelt founded the Pudelpointer Club of North America in Canada.

In Germany as well as North America, its performance standards are its most important trait. Before being approved for breeding, dogs and bitches must pass Hunt Test with minimum scores of their performance tests of its field, tracking, and water skills set by the various breed clubs. These clubs are the Verein Pudelpointer in Germany and the following clubs in North America: NAPPA, PCNA and VPP-GNA). The North American Versatile Hunting Dog Association (NAVHDA) also tests Pudelpointers and other breeds of versatile hunting dogs.

The Pudelpointer never became a popularized breed in the United States in part because breeders have actively avoided recognition by the American Kennel Club. Breeders believe that AKC recognition would place too much emphasis on form over function, possibly splitting the breed into a show breed and separate working class.

<text>Libero Liberati (20 September 1926 – 5 March 1962) was an Italian former professional motorcycle road racer. He competed in the FIM Grand Prix motorcycle racing world championships from 1952 to 1959, most prominently as a member of the Gilera factory racing team where he won the 500cc world championships.

Liberati was born in Terni. He became famous in his country, winning the Italian championship in 1948. Two years later Moto Guzzi called him to race in the 500cc World Championship, where he took part in a single race. The same happened the following year with Gilera. Liberati scored his first points in the World Championship in 1953, and his first race victory came in 1956 in the 350cc class.

In 1957, Liberati won the 500cc World Championship, scoring a total of four victories. He also won a race in the 350cc class. However, at the end of the season, a dispute with the Gilera factory left him without a ride. Two years later Moto Morini gave him the opportunity to race again, this time in the 250cc class.

On 5 March 1962, Liberati died from an accident, after he slipped on the wet road, violently hitting his head, during a training session on the .

<doc id="54189" wikidata="Q186251" url="?curid=54189" title="Surrealist automatism">
<text>Surrealist automatism is a method of art-making in which the artist suppresses conscious control over the making process, allowing the unconscious mind to have great sway. This drawing technique was popularized in the early 1920s, by Andre Masson and Hans Arp.

==Origins==
Automatism has taken on many forms: the automatic writing and drawing initially (and still to this day) explored by the surrealists can be compared to similar or parallel phenomena, such as the non-idiomatic improvisation.
&quot;Psychic automatism in its pure state&quot; was how André Breton defined Surrealism, and while the definition has proved capable of expansion, automatism remains of prime importance in the movement.

Early 20th-century Dadaists, such as Hans Arp, made some use of this method through chance operations. Surrealist artists, most notably André Masson, adapted to art the automatic writing method of André Breton and Philippe Soupault who composed with it &quot;Les Champs Magnétiques&quot; (The Magnetic Fields) in 1919. &quot;The Automatic Message&quot; (1933) was one of Breton&#x27;s significant theoretical works about automatism.

==Automatic drawing and painting==
Automatic drawing (distinguished from drawn expression of mediums) is an artistic technique developed by surrealists in which the hand is allowed to move randomly across the paper. In applying chance and accident to mark-making, drawing is to a large extent freed of rational control. Hence the drawing produced may be attributed in part to the subconscious and may reveal something of the psyche, which would otherwise be repressed. Examples of automatic drawing were produced by mediums and practitioners of the psychic arts. It was thought by some Spiritualists to be a spirit control that was producing the drawing while physically taking control of the medium&#x27;s body.

Automatic drawing was first written about by the English artist Austin Osman Spare who wrote a chapter, Automatic Drawing as a Means to Art, in his book, &quot;The Book of Pleasure&quot; (1913). Other artists who also practised automatic drawing were Hilma af Klint, André Masson, Joan Miró, Salvador Dalí, Jean Arp, André Breton and Freddy Flores Knistoff.

The technique of automatic drawing was transferred to painting (as seen in Miró&#x27;s paintings which often started out as automatic drawings), and has been adapted to other media; there have even been automatic &quot;drawings&quot; in computer graphics. Pablo Picasso was also thought to have expressed a type of automatic drawing in his later work, and particularly in his etchings and lithographic suites of the 1960s.

Most of the surrealists&#x27; automatic drawings were illusionistic, or more precisely, they developed into such drawings when representational forms seemed to suggest themselves. In the 1940s and 1950s the French Canadian group called Les Automatistes pursued creative work (chiefly painting) based on surrealist principles. They abandoned any trace of representation in their use of automatic drawing. This is perhaps a more pure form of automatic drawing since it can be almost entirely involuntary – to develop a representational form requires the conscious mind to take over the process of drawing, unless it is entirely accidental and thus incidental. These artists, led by Paul-Émile Borduas, sought to proclaim an entity of universal values and ethics proclaimed in their manifesto &quot;Refus Global&quot;.

As alluded to above, surrealist artists often found that their use of &quot;automatic drawing&quot; was not entirely automatic; rather, it involved some form of conscious intervention to make the image or painting visually acceptable or comprehensible, &quot;...Masson admitted that his &#x27;automatic&#x27; imagery involved a two-fold process of unconscious and conscious activity...&quot;

==Surautomatism==

Some Romanian surrealists invented a number of surrealist techniques (such as cubomania, entoptic graphomania, and the movement of liquid down a vertical surface) that purported to take automatism to an absurd point, and the name given, &quot;surautomatism&quot;, implies that the methods &quot;go beyond&quot; automatism, but this position is controversial.

==Paul-Émile Borduas==

The notion of automatism is also rooted in the artistic movement of the same name founded by Montreal artist Paul-Émile Borduas in 1942; himself influenced by the Dadaist movement as well as André Breton. He, as well as a dozen other artists from Quebec&#x27;s artistic scene, very much under restrictive and authoritarian rule in that period, signed the &quot;Global Refusal&quot; manifesto, in which the artists called upon North American society (specifically in the culturally unique environment of Quebec), to take notice and act upon the societal evolution projected by these new cultural paradigms opened by the Automatist movement as well as other influences in the 1940s.

==Contemporary techniques==
The computer, like the typewriter, can be used to produce automatic writing and automatic poetry. The practice of automatic drawing, originally performed with pencil or pen and paper, has also been adapted to mouse and monitor, and other automatic methods have also been either adapted from non-digital media, or invented specifically for the computer. For instance, filters have been automatically run in some bitmap editor programs such as Photoshop and GIMP, and computer-controlled brushes have been used by Roman Verostko to simulate automatism.
Grandview — a software application created in 2011 for the Mac — displays one word at a time across the entire screen as a user types, facilitating automatic writing.

<text>Belgian euro coins feature only a single design for all eight coins: the portrait or effigy of the King of the Belgians. Previously, all Belgian euros depicted King Albert II and his royal monogram. Current coins depict King Philippe. Also part of the design by Jan Alfons Keustermans are the 12 stars of the EU and the year of imprint.

==Belgian euro design==
For images of the common side and a detailed description of the coins, see euro coins.

In Belgium, the euro was introduced in 2002. However, the first sets of coins were minted, as preparation, in 1999. Hence the first euro coins of Belgium are marked 1999, not 2002.

===Reign of Albert II===
====First series (1999–2007)====
Belgian euro coins dated 1999–2007 have the portrait of King Albert II.

Prior to 2007, the old common side showing national borders was used, but the 2007 coins used the new common side without borders.

There are no signature marks or mint marks on both these types of coins.

====Second series (2008)====
In order to conform to the common guidelines on the design of national faces of coins, Belgium updated the design of the Belgian national face of euro coins to be produced from 2008. Coins from previous years featuring the old Belgian national face remain valid.

The changes are:
*The coin&#x27;s inner section shows an effigy of King Albert II in profile facing to the left.
*To the right of this, the royal monogram is displayed and, below it, the indication of the country ‘BE’.
*Underneath the effigy, the signature mark of the Master of the Mint is displayed on the left and the mint mark on the right, either side of the year.
*The outer ring of the coin depicts the twelve stars of the European flag only.

As from 2007, the Belgian euro coins also adopted the new common map like the rest of the eurozone countries. A proportion of the Belgian 2 euro coins -common part, the map looks smooth, whereas, the same map on the euros coming from other eurozone countries is dotted.

Belgium is the second state in the EMU, after Finland, to, from 2008 on, change the design of their standard circulation euro coins in accordance with recommendations defined by the Economic and Financial Affairs Council of the European Union.

====Amendment (2009-2013)====

The 2008 portrait did not comply with previous decisions by the ECOFIN in 2005 and 2008. Therefore, an amendment was made, which reverted to the portrait of Albert II found in the 2002 series. Mint marks, year and stars remain the same. Some collectors consider this as a third series but since unlike all series it was not published in the official journal of the European Union, it is actually an amendment and not a new series.

===Reign of Philippe===

====Third series (2014–present)====
Following the accession of King Philippe after the abdication of Albert II, new distinctive sides were added depicting the new monarch.

Coins with the new obverse were struck from 4 February 2014. The obverses were designed by Luc Luycx.

==Circulating mintage quantities==
The following table shows the mintage quantity for all Belgian euro coins issued into circulation, per denomination, per year.

==Identifying marks==


==Belgian proof set==

Each year the Royal Belgian Mint issues a limited edition of its euro coins in proof quality. Since January 2018, the Royal Belgian Mint has ceased to strike coins for Belgium, the Royal Dutch Mint has since struck all the euro coins for Belgium.

==€2 commemorative coins==
==Other commemorative coins (collectors&#x27; coins)==
Belgium has a good collection of euro commemorative coins, solely in silver and gold. Their face values range from 2.5 euros to 100 euros. This is mainly done as a legacy of old national practice of minting gold and silver coins. These coins are not really intended to be used as means of payment, so generally they do not circulate.

<text>Stingrays are a group of sea rays, a type of cartilaginous fish. They are classified in the suborder Myliobatoidei of the order Myliobatiformes and consist of eight families: Hexatrygonidae (sixgill stingray), Plesiobatidae (deepwater stingray), Urolophidae (stingarees), Urotrygonidae (round rays), Dasyatidae (whiptail stingrays), Potamotrygonidae (river stingrays), Gymnuridae (butterfly rays) and Myliobatidae (eagle rays).
There are about 220 known stingray species organized into 29 genera.

Stingrays are common in coastal tropical and subtropical marine waters throughout the world. Some species, such as the thorntail stingray (&quot;Dasyatis thetidis&quot;), are found in warmer temperate oceans and others, such as the deepwater stingray (&quot;Plesiobatis daviesi&quot;), are found in the deep ocean. The river stingrays and a number of whiptail stingrays (such as the Niger stingray (&quot;Fontitrygon garouaensis&quot;)) are restricted to fresh water. Most myliobatoids are demersal (inhabiting the next-to-lowest zone in the water column), but some, such as the pelagic stingray and the eagle rays, are pelagic.

Stingray species are progressively becoming threatened or vulnerable to extinction, particularly as the consequence of unregulated fishing. As of 2013, 45 species have been listed as vulnerable or endangered by the IUCN. The status of some other species is poorly known, leading to their being listed as data deficient.

== Evolution ==

Stingrays diverged from their closest relatives, the panrays, during the Late Jurassic period, and diversified over the course of the Cretaceous into the different extant families today. The earliest stingrays appear to have been benthic, with the ancestors of the eagle rays becoming pelagic during the early Late Cretaceous. 

===Fossils===

Permineralized stingray teeth have been found in sedimentary deposits around the world as far back as the Early Cretaceous. The oldest known stingray taxon is &quot;Dasyatis&quot; &quot;speetonensis&quot; from the Hauterivian of England, whose teeth most closely resemble that of the extant sixgill stingray (&quot;Hexatrygon&quot;). Although stingray teeth are rare on sea bottoms compared to the similar shark teeth, scuba divers searching for the latter do encounter the teeth of stingrays. 

Full-body stingray fossils are very rare but are known from certain lagerstätte that preserve soft-bodied animals. The extinct &quot;Cyclobatis&quot; of the Cretaceous of Lebanon is thought to be a skate that had convergently evolved a highly stingray-like body plan, although its exact taxonomic placement is still uncertain. True stingray fossils become more common in the Eocene, with the extinct freshwater stingrays &quot;Heliobatis&quot; and &quot;Asterotrygon&quot; known from the Green River Formation. A diversity of stingray fossils is known from the Eocene Monte Bolca formation from Italy, including the early stingaree &quot;Arechia&quot;, as well as &quot;Dasyomyliobatis&quot;, which is thought to represent a transitional form between stingrays and eagle rays, and the highly unusual &quot;Lessiniabatis&quot;, which had an extremely short and slender tail with no sting.

==Anatomy==

=== Jaw and teeth ===
The mouth of the stingray is located on the ventral side of the vertebrate. Stingrays exhibit hyostylic jaw suspension, which means that the mandibular arch is only suspended by an articulation with the hyomandibula. This type of suspensions allows for the upper jaw to have high mobility and protrude outward. The teeth are modified placoid scales that are regularly shed and replaced. In general, the teeth have a root implanted within the connective tissue and a visible portion of the tooth, is large and flat, allowing them to crush the bodies of hard shelled prey. Male stingrays display sexual dimorphism by developing cusps, or pointed ends, to some of their teeth. During mating season, some stingray species fully change their tooth morphology which then returns to baseline during non-mating seasons.

=== Spiracles ===
Spiracles are small openings that allow some fish and amphibians to breathe. Stingray spiracles are openings just behind its eyes. The respiratory system of stingrays is complicated by having two separate ways to take in water to use the oxygen. Most of the time stingrays take in water using their mouth and then send the water through the gills for gas exchange. This is efficient, but the mouth cannot be used when hunting because the stingrays bury themselves in the ocean sediment and wait for prey to swim by. So the stingray switches to using its spiracles. With the spiracles, they can draw water free from sediment directly into their gills for gas exchange. These alternate ventilation organs are less efficient than the mouth, since spiracles are unable to pull the same volume of water. However, it is enough when the stingray is quietly waiting to ambush its prey.

The flattened bodies of stingrays allow them to effectively conceal themselves in their environments. Stingrays do this by agitating the sand and hiding beneath it. Because their eyes are on top of their bodies and their mouths on the undersides, stingrays cannot see their prey after capture; instead, they use smell and electroreceptors (ampullae of Lorenzini) similar to those of sharks. Stingrays settle on the bottom while feeding, often leaving only their eyes and tails visible. Coral reefs are favorite feeding grounds and are usually shared with sharks during high tide.

==Behavior==
===Reproduction===

During the breeding season, males of various stingray species such as the round stingray (&quot;Urobatis halleri&quot;), may rely on their ampullae of Lorenzini to sense certain electrical signals given off by mature females before potential copulation. When a male is courting a female, he follows her closely, biting at her pectoral disc. He then places one of his two claspers into her valve.

Reproductive ray behaviors are associated with their behavioral endocrinology, for example, in species such as the atlantic stingray (&quot;Hypanus sabinus&quot;), social groups are formed first, then the sexes display complex courtship behaviors that end in pair copulation which is similar to the species &quot;Urobatis halleri.&quot; Furthermore, their mating period is one of the longest recorded in elasmobranch fish. Individuals are known to mate for seven months before the females ovulate in March. During this time, the male stingrays experience increased levels of androgen hormones which has been linked to its prolonged mating periods. The behavior expressed among males and females during specific parts of this period involves aggressive social interactions. Frequently, the males trail females with their snout near the female vent then proceed to bite the female on her fins and her body. Although this mating behavior is similar to the species &quot;Urobatis halleri&quot;, differences can be seen in the particular actions of &quot;Hypanus sabinus&quot;. Seasonal elevated levels of serum androgens coincide with the expressed aggressive behavior, which led to the proposal that androgen steroids start, indorse and maintain aggressive sexual behaviors in the male rays for this species which drives the prolonged mating season. Similarly, concise elevations of serum androgens in females has been connected to increased aggression and improvement in mate choice. When their androgen steroid levels are elevated, they are able to improve their mate choice by quickly fleeing from tenacious males when undergoing ovulation succeeding impregnation. This ability affects the paternity of their offspring by refusing less qualified mates.

Stingrays are ovoviviparous, bearing live young in &quot;litters&quot; of five to thirteen. During this period, the female&#x27;s behavior transitions to support of her future offspring. Females hold the embryos in the womb without a placenta. Instead, the embryos absorb nutrients from a yolk sac and after the sac is depleted, the mother provides uterine &quot;milk&quot;. After birth, the offspring generally disassociate from the mother and swim away, having been born with the instinctual abilities to protect and feed themselves. In a very small number of species, like the giant freshwater stingray (&quot;Urogymnus polylepis&quot;), the mother &quot;cares&quot; for her young by having them swim with her until they are one-third of her size.

At the Sea Life London Aquarium, two female stingrays delivered seven baby stingrays, although the mothers have not been near a male for two years. This suggests some species of rays can store sperm then give birth when they deem conditions to be suitable.

=== Locomotion ===
The stingray uses its paired pectoral fins for moving around. This is in contrast to sharks and most other fish, which get most of their swimming power from a single caudal (tail) fin. Stingray pectoral fin locomotion can be divided into two categories, undulatory and oscillatory. Stingrays that use undulatory locomotion have shorter thicker fins for slower motile movements in benthic areas. Longer thinner pectoral fins make for faster speeds in oscillation mobility in pelagic zones. Visually distinguishable oscillation has less than one wave going, opposed to undulation having more than one wave at all times.

=== Feeding behavior and diet ===

Stingrays use a wide range of feeding strategies. Some have specialized jaws that allow them to crush hard mollusk shells, whereas others use external mouth structures called cephalic lobes to guide plankton into their oral cavity. Benthic stingrays (those that reside on the sea floor) are ambush hunters. They wait until prey comes near, then use a strategy called &quot;tenting&quot;. With pectoral fins pressed against the substrate, the ray will raise its head, generating a suction force that pulls the prey underneath the body. This form of whole-body suction is analogous to the buccal suction feeding performed by ray-finned fish. Stingrays exhibit a wide range of colors and patterns on their dorsal surface to help them camouflage with the sandy bottom. Some stingrays can even change color over the course of several days to adjust to new habitats. Since their mouths are on the underside of their bodies, they catch their prey, then crush and eat with their powerful jaws. Like its shark relatives, the stingray is outfitted with electrical sensors called ampullae of Lorenzini. Located around the stingray&#x27;s mouth, these organs sense the natural electrical charges of potential prey. Many rays have jaw teeth to enable them to crush mollusks such as clams, oysters and mussels.

Most stingrays feed primarily on mollusks, crustaceans and, occasionally, on small fish. Freshwater stingrays in the Amazon feed on insects and break down their tough exoskeletons with mammal-like chewing motions. Large pelagic rays like the manta use ram feeding to consume vast quantities of plankton and have been seen swimming in acrobatic patterns through plankton patches.

==Stingray injuries==

Stingrays are not usually aggressive and ordinarily attack humans only when provoked, such as when they are accidentally stepped on. Stingrays can have one, two or three blades. Contact with the spinal blade or blades causes local trauma (from the cut itself), pain, swelling, muscle cramps from the venom and, later, may result in infection from bacteria or fungi. The injury is very painful, but rarely life-threatening unless the stinger pierces a vital area. The blade is often deeply barbed and usually breaks off in the wound. Surgery may be required to remove the fragments.

Fatal stings are very rare. The death of Steve Irwin in 2006 was only the second recorded in Australian waters since 1945. The stinger penetrated his thoracic wall and pierced his heart, causing massive trauma and bleeding.

=== Venom ===

The venom of the stingray has been relatively unstudied due to the mixture of venomous tissue secretions cells and mucous membrane cell products that occurs upon secretion from the spinal blade. The spine is covered with the epidermal skin layer. During secretion, the venom penetrates the epidermis and mixes with the mucus to release the venom on its victim. Typically, other venomous organisms create and store their venom in a gland. The stingray is notable in that it stores its venom within tissue cells. The toxins that have been confirmed to be within the venom are cystatins, peroxiredoxin and galectin. Galectin induces cell death in its victims and cystatins inhibit defense enzymes. In humans, these toxins lead to increased blood flow in the superficial capillaries and cell death. Despite the number of cells and toxins that are within the stingray, there is little relative energy required to produce and store the venom.

The venom is produced and stored in the secretory cells of the vertebral column at the mid-distal region. These secretory cells are housed within the ventrolateral grooves of the spine. The cells of both marine and freshwater stingrays are round and contain a great amount of granule-filled cytoplasm. The stinging cells of marine stingrays are located only within these lateral grooves of the stinger. The stinging cells of freshwater stingray branch out beyond the lateral grooves to cover a larger surface area along the entire blade. Due to this large area and an increased number of proteins within the cells, the venom of freshwater stingrays has a greater toxicity than that of marine stingrays.

==Human use==
===As food===
Rays are edible, and may be caught as food using fishing lines or spears. Stingray recipes can be found in many coastal areas worldwide. For example, in Malaysia and Singapore, stingray is commonly grilled over charcoal, then served with spicy &quot;sambal&quot; sauce. In Goa, and other Indian states, it is sometimes used as part of spicy curries. Generally, the most prized parts of the stingray are the wings, the &quot;cheek&quot; (the area surrounding the eyes), and the liver. The rest of the ray is considered too rubbery to have any culinary uses.

===Ecotourism===

Stingrays are usually very docile and curious, their usual reaction being to flee any disturbance, but they sometimes brush their fins past any new object they encounter. Nevertheless, certain larger species may be more aggressive and should be approached with caution, as the stingray&#x27;s defensive reflex (use of its venomous stinger) may result in serious injury or death.

===Other uses===

The skin of the ray is used as an under layer for the cord or leather wrap (known as &quot;samegawa&quot; in Japanese) on Japanese swords due to its hard, rough texture that keeps the braided wrap from sliding on the handle during use.

Several ethnological sections in museums, such as the British Museum, display arrowheads and spearheads made of stingray stingers, used in Micronesia and elsewhere. Henry de Monfreid stated in his books that before World War II, in the Horn of Africa, whips were made from the tails of big stingrays and these devices inflicted cruel cuts, so in Aden, the British forbade their use on women and slaves. In former Spanish colonies, a stingray is called (&quot;whip ray&quot;).

Some stingray species are commonly seen in public aquarium exhibits and more recently in home aquaria.

<text>German euro coins have three separate designs for the three series of coins. The 1-cent, 2-cent and 5-cent coins were designed by , the design for the 10-cent, 20-cent and 50-cent coins were designed by and the 1- and 2-euro coins were done by and Sneschana Russewa-Hoyer. Featured in all designs are the 12 stars of the EU and the year of minting.

In addition to the year, the German coins also feature a small letter as a mint mark indicating the particular mint that minted the coin.

* A: Berlin
* D: Munich
* F: Stuttgart
* G: Karlsruhe
* J: Hamburg

The letters were assigned to the mints as they opened. The mints in Hannover/Vienna (B), Frankfurt am Main (C), and Darmstadt (H) were closed by 1882. After the German separation, D, F, G and J minted coins for the Federal Republic of Germany, while the German Democratic Republic used Berlin (A) and Dresden/Muldenhütte (E) until it closed 1953. Berlin (A) started minting D Mark coins in 1990.

==German euro design==
For images of the common side and a detailed description of the coins, see euro coins.

==Circulating Mintage quantities==
The following table shows the mintage quantity for all German euro coins, per denomination, per year (the numbers are represented in millions).











==€2 commemorative coins==
===German Bundesländer series I===
Germany started the commemorative coin series &quot;&quot; (The 16 States of the Federal Republic of Germany) in 2006, to continue until 2021. The year in which the coin for a specific state is issued coincides with that state&#x27;s Presidency of the &quot;Bundesrat&quot;. In 2018, Daniel Günther, the Minister President of Schleswig-Holstein, became the President of the Bundesrat for a one-year term. As a Schleswig-Holstein coin had already been minted in 2006, it was decided to delay the release of the following three states&#x27; coins by a year. Instead of honouring a state in 2019, the minted coin commemorates 70 years since the constitution of the German Federal Council or Bundesrat. The last three coins of the series were therefore postponed to 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively. The coins issued are:

The original designs for these states were changed and were as follows:
* 2008 Hamburg: Landungsbrücken
* 2010 Free Hanseatic City of Bremen: Bremen City Hall not including Bremen Roland
* 2012 Bavaria: Munich Frauenkirche
* 2013 Baden-Württemberg Heidelberg Castle
* 2014 Lower Saxony: Hanover New City Hall
* 2015 Hesse: Römer in Frankfurt am Main
* 2018 Berlin: Reichstag

===German Bundesländer series II===
===Others===
As of 2023, Germany has issued eleven other €2 commemorative coins in addition to those of the &quot;Bundesländer&quot; series:

<doc id="54201" wikidata="Q422241" url="?curid=54201" title="Sodium dodecyl sulfate">
<text>Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) or sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), sometimes written sodium laurilsulfate, is an organic compound with the formula and structure . It is an anionic surfactant used in many cleaning and hygiene products. This compound is the sodium salt of the 12-carbon organosulfate. Its hydrocarbon tail combined with a polar &quot;headgroup&quot; give the compound amphiphilic properties that make it useful as a detergent. SDS is also component of mixtures produced from inexpensive coconut and palm oils. SDS is a common component of many domestic cleaning, personal hygiene and cosmetic, pharmaceutical, and food products, as well as of industrial and commercial cleaning and product formulations.

==Physicochemical properties==

The critical micelle concentration (CMC) in water at 25 °C is 8.2 mM, and the aggregation number at this concentration is usually considered to be about 62. The micelle ionization fraction (α) is around 0.3 (or 30%).
== Applications ==

===Cleaning and hygiene===
SDS is mainly used in detergents for laundry with many cleaning applications. It is a highly effective surfactant and is used in any task requiring the removal of oily stains and residues. For example, it is found in higher concentrations with industrial products including engine degreasers, floor cleaners, and car exterior cleaners.

It is a component in hand soap, toothpastes, shampoos, shaving creams, and bubble bath formulations, for its ability to create a foam (lather), for its surfactant properties, and in part for its thickening effect.

===Food additive===
Sodium dodecyl sulfate, appearing as its synonym &quot;sodium lauryl sulfate&quot; (SLS), is considered a generally recognized as safe (GRAS) ingredient for food use according to the USFDA (21 CFR 172.822). It is used as an emulsifying agent and whipping aid. As an emulsifier in or with egg whites the United States Code of Federal Regulations require that it must not exceed 1,000 parts per million (0.1%) in egg white solids or 125 parts per million (0.0125%) in frozen or liquid egg whites and as a whipping agent for the preparation of marshmallows it must not exceed 0.5% of the weight of gelatine. SLS is reported to temporarily diminish perception of sweetness.

===Laboratory applications===
SDS is used in cleaning procedures, and is commonly used as a component for lysing cells during RNA extraction or DNA extraction, inhibiting the activity of nucleases, enzymes that can degrade DNA, protecting the integrity of the isolated genetic material, and for denaturing proteins in preparation for electrophoresis in the SDS-PAGE technique.

In the case of SDS-PAGE, the compound works by disrupting non-covalent bonds in the proteins, and so denaturing them, i.e. causing the protein molecules to lose their native conformations and shapes. By binding to proteins at a ratio of one SDS molecule per 2 amino acid residues, the negatively charged detergent provides all proteins with a similar net negative charge and therefore a similar charge-to-mass ratio. In this way, the difference in mobility of the polypeptide chains in the gel can be attributed solely to their length as opposed to both their native charge and shape. This separation based on the size of the polypeptide chain simplifies the analysis of protein molecules. 

====Pharmaceutical applications====
Sodium lauryl sulfate is a widely used in the pharmaceutical field as an ionic solubilizer and emulsifier that is suitable for applications in liquid dispersions, solutions, emulsions and micro emulsions, tablets, foams and semi-solids such as creams, lotions and gels. Additionally, SLS aids in tablet wettability, as well as lubrication during manufacturing. Brand names of pharma-grade SLS include Kolliphor SLS and Kolliphor SLS Fine.

====Miscellaneous applications====
SLS is used in an improved technique for preparing brain tissues for study by optical microscopy. The technique, which has been branded as CLARITY, was the work of Karl Deisseroth and coworkers at Stanford University, and involves infusion of the organ with an acrylamide solution to bind the macromolecules of the organ (proteins, nucleic acids, etc.), followed by thermal polymerization to form a &quot;brain–hydrogel&quot; (a mesh interspersed throughout the tissue to fix the macromolecules and other structures in space), and then by lipid removal using SDS to eliminate light scattering with minimal protein loss, rendering the tissue quasi-transparent.

Along with sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate and Triton X-100, aqueous solutions of SDS are popular for dispersing or suspending nanotubes, such as carbon nanotubes.

===Other uses===
SLS has been proposed as a potentially effective topical microbicide, for intravaginal use, to inhibit and possibly prevent infection by various enveloped and non-enveloped viruses such as the herpes simplex viruses, HIV, and the Semliki Forest virus.

Liquid membranes formed from SDS in water have been demonstrated to work as unusual particle separators. The device acts as a reverse filter, allowing large particles to pass while capturing smaller particles.

== Production ==
Dodecyl alcohol is sulfated using sulfur trioxide. The reaction proceeds by initial formation of the pyrosulfate:
:
Several million tons are produced annually.

SDS can also be synthesized by treating lauryl alcohol with chlorosulfuric acid.
The resulting half ester of sulfuric acid is then neutralized with alkali.

Lauryl alcohol can be used in pure form or as a mixtures of fatty alcohols. When produced from these sources, &quot;SDS&quot; products are a mixture of various sodium alkyl sulfates with SDS being the main component. For instance, SDS is a component, along with other chain-length amphiphiles, when produced from coconut oil, and is known as sodium coco sulfate (SCS). SDS is available commercially in powder, pellet, and other forms (each differing in rates of dissolution), as well as in aqueous solutions of varying concentrations.

== Safety ==
SDS is not carcinogenic in low concentrations according to some studies. Like all detergents, sodium lauryl sulfate removes oils from the skin, and can cause skin and eye irritation. It has been shown to irritate the skin of the face, with prolonged and constant exposure (more than an hour) in young adults. SDS may worsen skin problems in individuals with chronic skin hypersensitivity, with some people being affected more than others.

=== Oral concerns ===

SDS is a common ingredient in toothpastes due to its low cost, its lack of impact on taste, and its desirable action as a foaming agent.

==== VSCs ====

SDS may reduce the amount of bad breath-causing volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) in the mouth. A series of small crossover studies (25–34 patients) have supported the efficacy of SLS in the reduction of VSCs, and its related positive impact on breath malodor, although these studies have been generally noted to reflect technical challenges in the control of study design variables.

==== Dry mouth ====

Primary sources from the group of Irma Rantanen at University of Turku, Finland claim that SLS-containing pastes cause more dry mouth (xerostomia) than their proposed alternative. However, a 2011 Cochrane review of these studies, and of the more general area, concludes that there &quot;is no strong evidence... that any topical therapy is effective for relieving the symptom of dry mouth.&quot;

==== Mouth ulceration ====

A safety concern has been raised on the basis of several studies regarding the effect of toothpaste SDS on aphthous ulcers (more specifically, mouth ulcers or &quot;canker sores&quot;), commonly referred to as canker or white sores. According to the NHS, SLS is a cause for concern for mouth ulcers. As Lippert notes, of 2013, &quot;very few... marketed toothpastes contain a surfactant other than SLS [SDS],&quot; and leading manufacturers continue to formulate their produce with SDS.

<doc id="54204" wikidata="Q130650" url="?curid=54204" title="Philip II of Macedon">
<text>Philip II of Macedon (; 382 BC – October 336 BC) was the king (&quot;basileus&quot;) of the ancient kingdom of Macedonia from 359 BC until his death in 336 BC. He was a member of the Argead dynasty, founders of the ancient kingdom, and the father of Alexander the Great.

The rise of Macedon, including its conquest and political consolidation of most of Classical Greece during his reign, was achieved by his reformation of the army (the establishment of the Macedonian phalanx that proved critical in securing victories on the battlefield), his extensive use of siege engines, and his use of effective diplomacy and marriage alliances.

After defeating the Greek city-states of Athens and Thebes at the Battle of Chaeronea in 338 BC, Philip II led the effort to establish a federation of Greek states known as the League of Corinth, with him as the elected hegemon and commander-in-chief of Greece for a planned invasion of the Achaemenid Empire of Persia. However, his assassination by a royal bodyguard, Pausanias of Orestis, led to the immediate succession of his son Alexander, who would go on to invade the Achaemenid Empire in his father&#x27;s stead.

==Early life==
Philip was born in either 383 or 382 BC, and was the youngest son of King Amyntas III and Eurydice of Lynkestis. He had two older brothers, Alexander II and Perdiccas III, as well as a sister named Eurynoe. Amyntas later married another woman, Gygaea, with whom he had three sons, Philip&#x27;s half-brothers Archelaus, Arrhidaeus, and Menelaus.

After the assassination of Alexander II, Philip was sent as a hostage to Illyria by Ptolemy of Aloros. Philip was later held in Thebes (–365 BC), which at the time was the leading city of Greece. While in Thebes, Philip received a military and diplomatic education from Epaminondas, and lived with Pammenes, who was an enthusiastic advocate of the Sacred Band of Thebes.

In 364 BC, Philip returned to Macedon. In 359 BC, perhaps in May, Philip&#x27;s other brother, King Perdiccas III, died in battle against the Illyrians. Before leaving, Perdiccas had appointed Philip as regent for his infant son Amyntas IV, but Philip succeeded in taking the kingdom for himself.

Philip&#x27;s military skills and expansionist vision of Macedonia brought him early success. He first had to remedy the woes over Macedonian territory faced by his throne&#x27;s government. This was a predicament that had greatly worsened through Macedonia&#x27;s defeat by the Illyrians, a struggle in which King Perdiccas himself had died. The Paeonians and the Thracians had sacked and invaded the eastern regions of Macedonia, while the Athenians had landed at Methoni on the coast with a contingent under the Macedonian pretender Argaeus II.

== Military career ==

=== Improvements to the army ===

Philip pushed back the Paeonians and Thracians promising tributes, and defeated the 3,000 Athenian hoplites (359 BC). Momentarily free from his opponents, he concentrated on strengthening his internal position and, above all, his army. Philip II made many notable contributions to the Macedonian army. The cavalry, which were the primary source of the army&#x27;s strength, went from a force of 600 to 4000 from the time of the battles with the Illyrians to 334 BC. The discipline and training of the soldiers increased as well, and the Macedonian soldiers under Philip were provided with the possibility of promotion through the ranks and rewards and bonus wages for exceptional service. In addition to these changes, Philip created the Macedonian phalanx, an infantry formation that consisted of soldiers all armed with a &quot;sarissa.&quot; Philip is credited for adding the &quot;sarissa&quot; to the Macedonian army, where it soon was the common weapon used by most soldiers.

===Early military career===

Philip had married Audata, daughter or granddaughter of the Illyrian king Bardylis. However, this marriage did not prevent him from marching against the Illyrians in 358 BC and defeating them in a battle in which some 7,000 Illyrians died (357 BC). By this move, Philip established his authority inland as far as Lake Ohrid and earned the favour of the Epirotes.

After securing the western and southern borders of Macedon, Philip went on to besiege Amphipolis in 357 BC. The Athenians had been unable to conquer Amphipolis, which commanded the gold mines of Mount Pangaion, so Philip reached an agreement with Athens to lease the city to them after his conquest, in exchange for Pydna (which was lost by Macedon in 363 BC). However, after conquering Amphipolis, Philip captured Pydna for himself and kept both cities (357 BC). Athens soon declared war against him, and as a result, Philip allied Macedon with the Chalcidian League of Olynthus. He subsequently conquered Potidaea, this time keeping his word and ceding it to the League in 356 BC.

In 357 BC, Philip married the Epirote princess Olympias, who was the daughter of the king of the Molossians. Alexander was born in 356 BC, the same year as Philip&#x27;s racehorse won at the Olympic Games.

During 356 BC, Philip conquered the town of Crenides and changed its name to Philippi. He then established a powerful garrison there to control its mines, which yielded much of the gold he later used for his campaigns. In the meantime, his general Parmenion defeated the Illyrians again.

In 355–354 BC he besieged Methone, the last city on the Thermaic Gulf controlled by Athens. During the siege, Philip was injured in his right eye, which was later removed surgically. Despite the arrival of two Athenian fleets, the city fell in 354 BC. Philip also attacked Abdera and Maronea, on the Thracian coast (354–353 BC).

===Third Sacred War===
Philip&#x27;s involvement in the Third Sacred War (356–346 BC) began in 354 BC. At the request of the Thessalian League, Philip and his army traveled to Thessaly in order to capture Pagasae, resulting in an alliance with Thebes. A year later in 353 BC, Philip was once again asked to assist in battle, but this time against the tyrant Lycophron who was supported by Onomarchus. Philip and his forces invaded Thessaly, defeating 7,000 Phocians and forcing Phayllus, the brother of Onomarchus, to leave.

That same year, Onomarchus and his army defeated Philip in two succeeding battles. Philip returned to Thessaly the next summer, this time with an army of 20,000 infantry, 3,000 cavalry, and the additional support of the Thessalian League&#x27;s forces. At the Battle of Crocus Field, 6,000 Phocians fell and 3,000 were taken as prisoners and later drowned. This battle earned Philip immense prestige as well as the free acquisition of Pherae. He was made the leader (&quot;archon&quot;) of the Thessalian League and was able to claim Magnesia and Perrhaebia, which expanded his territory to Pagasae. Philip did not attempt to advance into Central Greece because the Athenians, unable to arrive in time to defend Pagasae, had occupied Thermopylae.

There were no hostilities with Athens yet, but Athens was threatened by the Macedonians. From 352 to 346 BC, Philip did not again travel south. He was active in completing the subjugation of the Balkan hill-country to the west and north, and in reducing the Greek cities of the coast as far as the Hebrus. To the chief of these coastal cities, Olynthus, Philip continued to profess friendship until its neighboring cities were in his hands.
In 348 BC, Philip started the siege of Olynthus, which, apart from its strategic position, housed his half-brothers, Arrhidaeus and Menelaus, pretenders to the Macedonian throne. Olynthus had at first allied itself with Philip, but later shifted its allegiance to Athens. The latter, however, did nothing to help the city because its expeditions were held back by a revolt in Euboea. The Macedonian king took Olynthus in 348 BC and razed the city to the ground. The same fate was inflicted on other cities of the Chalcidian peninsula, resulting in the Chalcidian League dissolving.

Macedon and the regions adjoining it having now been securely consolidated, Philip celebrated his Olympic Games at Dium. In 347 BC, Philip advanced to the conquest of the eastern districts about Hebrus, and compelled the submission of the Thracian prince Cersobleptes. In 346 BC, he intervened effectively in the war between Thebes and the Phocians, but his wars with Athens continued intermittently. However, Athens had made overtures for peace, and when Philip again moved south, peace was sworn in Thessaly.

===Later campaigns (346–336 BC)===
With key Greek city-states in submission, Philip II turned to Sparta, warning them &quot;If I invade Laconia, I shall turn you out.&quot; The Spartans&#x27; laconic reply was one word: &quot;If.&quot; Philip proceeded to invade Laconia, devastate much of it and eject the Spartans from various parts.

In 345 BC, Philip conducted a hard-fought campaign against the Ardiaioi (Ardiaei), under their king Pleuratus I, during which Philip was seriously wounded in the lower right leg by an Ardian soldier.

In 342 BC, Philip led a military expedition north against the Scythians, conquering the Thracian fortified settlement Eumolpia to give it his name, &quot;Philippopolis&quot; (modern Plovdiv).

In 340 BC, Philip started the siege of Perinthus, and in 339 BC, began another siege against the city of Byzantium. As both sieges failed, Philip&#x27;s influence over Greece was compromised. He successfully reasserted his authority in the Aegean by defeating an alliance of Thebans and Athenians at the Battle of Chaeronea in 338 BC, and in the same year, destroyed Amfissa because the residents had illegally cultivated part of the Crisaian plain which belonged to Delphi. These decisive victories led to Philip being recognized as the military leader of the League of Corinth, a Greek confederation allied against the Persian Empire, in 338/7 BC. Members of the league agreed never to wage war against each other, unless it was to suppress revolution.

===Asian campaign (336 BC)===
Philip II was involved quite early against the Achaemenid Empire. From around 352 BC, he supported several Persian opponents to Artaxerxes III, such as Artabazos II, Amminapes or a Persian nobleman named Sisines, by receiving them for several years as exiles at the Macedonian court. This gave him a good knowledge of Persian issues, and may even have influenced some of his innovations in the management of the Macedonian state. Alexander was also acquainted with these Persian exiles during his youth.

In 336 BC, Philip II sent Parmenion, with Amyntas, Andromenes and Attalus, and an army of 10,000 men into Asia Minor to make preparations for an invasion to free the Greeks living on the western coast and islands from Achaemenid rule. At first, all went well. The Greek cities on the western coast of Anatolia revolted until the news arrived that Philip had been assassinated and had been succeeded as king by his young son Alexander. The Macedonians were demoralized by Philip&#x27;s death and were subsequently defeated near Magnesia by the Achaemenids under the command of the mercenary Memnon of Rhodes.

== Marriages and family ==
The kings of Macedon practiced polygamy. Philip II had seven wives throughout his life, all members of royalty from foreign dynasties, and all of which were considered queens, making their children royalty as well. The dates of Philip&#x27;s multiple marriages and the names of some of his wives are contested. Below is the order of marriages:
* Audata, the daughter of Illyrian king Bardyllis. Mother of Cynane.
* Phila of Elimeia, the sister of Derdas and Machatas of Elimiotis.
* Nicesipolis of Pherae, Thessaly, mother of Thessalonica.
* Olympias of Epirus, daughter of Neoptolemus I, mother of Alexander the Great and Cleopatra.
* Philinna of Larissa, mother of Arrhidaeus later called Philip III of Macedon.
* Meda of Odessos, daughter of the king Cothelas, of Thrace.
* Cleopatra, daughter of Hippostratus and niece of general Attalus of Macedonia. Philip renamed her Cleopatra Eurydice of Macedon.









==Assassination==

King Philip was assassinated in October 336 BC (perhaps 25 October) at Aegae, the ancient capital of the kingdom of Macedon. Philip and his royal court were gathered in order to celebrate the marriage of Alexander I of Epirus and Cleopatra of Macedon, Philip&#x27;s daughter by his fourth wife Olympias. While the king was entering into the town&#x27;s theatre, he was unprotected in order to appear approachable to the Greek diplomats and dignitaries who were present at that time. Philip was suddenly approached by Pausanias of Orestis, one of his seven bodyguards, and was stabbed in his ribs. After Philip was killed, the assassin immediately tried to escape and reach his getaway associates, who were waiting for him with horses at the entrance to Aegae. The assassin was pursued by three of Philip&#x27;s other bodyguards, and during the chase, his horse tripped on a vine. He was subsequently stabbed to death by the bodyguards.

The three sons of Aeropus of Lyncestis were also suspected of taking part in the plot, acting as accomplices of Pausanias. Arrhabaeus and Heromenes were put to death, while the third brother, Alexander of Lyncestis, was pardoned.

The reasons for the assassination are difficult to ascertain. There was controversy even among ancient historians; the only known surviving contemporary account is that of Aristotle, who states simply that Philip was killed because Pausanias had been offended by Attalus (Philip&#x27;s uncle-in-law) and his friends. Attalus was the uncle of Philip&#x27;s wife Cleopatra (renamed Eurydice upon marriage).

===Cleitarchus&#x27; analysis===
Fifty years later, the historian Cleitarchus expanded and embellished the story. Centuries afterwards, this version was propagated by Diodorus Siculus and other historians who relied on Cleitarchus. According to the sixteenth book of Diodorus&#x27; history, Pausanias of Orestis had been a lover of Philip, but became jealous when Philip turned his attention to a younger man, also called Pausanias. The elder Pausanias&#x27; taunting of the new lover caused the younger Pausanias to throw away his life in battle, which turned his friend Attalus against the elder Pausanias. Attalus took his revenge by getting Pausanias of Orestis drunk at a public dinner and then raping him.

When Pausanias complained to Philip, the king felt unable to chastise Attalus, as he was about to send him to Asia with Parmenion to establish a bridgehead for an invasion he was planning. Also, Philip had recently married Attalus&#x27; niece, Cleopatra Eurydice. Rather than offend Attalus, Philip tried to mollify Pausanias by elevating him within his personal bodyguard. Pausanias then seems to have redirected his desire for revenge towards the man who had failed to avenge his damaged honour, and accordingly to plan to kill Philip. Some time after the alleged rape, while Attalus was away in Asia fighting the Persians, he put his plan into action.

===Justin&#x27;s analysis===

Other historians (e.g., Justin 9.7) suggested that Alexander and/or his mother Olympias were at least privy to the intrigue, if not themselves instigators. Olympias seems to have been anything but discreet in manifesting her gratitude to Pausanias, according to Justin&#x27;s report: He writes that the same night of her return from exile, she placed a crown on the assassin&#x27;s corpse, and later erected a tumulus over his grave and ordered that annual sacrifices be made to the memory of Pausanias.

===Modern analysis===
Some modern historians have claimed that none of the accounts are probable: They say that in the case of Pausanias, the purported motive for the crime hardly seems adequate. Furthermore they claim that implicating Alexander and Olympias in the plot seems specious, to act as they did would have required them to act with an improbable degree of brazen effrontery in the face of a military whose members were personally loyal to Philip. What seems to have been recorded, rather, are simply suspicions that were naturally directed towards the chief beneficiaries of the assassination; however, their actions in response to the murder are hardly evidence of their guilt with respect to the crime itself, regardless of how sympathetic they might have seemed afterward.

Scholar Daniel Ogden has noted that if there was a sexual side to the murder, &quot;then it can be contextualized in this regard against known homosexual relationships in and around the Macedonian court&quot; and that according to Aristotle, the regicide of Archelaus I of Macedon was by his former &quot;eromenoi&quot;, Crateuas and Hellenocrates of Larissa.

Whatever the actual background to the assassination, it may have had an enormous effect on later world events, far beyond what any conspirators could have predicted. As asserted by some modern historians, had the older and more settled Philip been the one in charge of the war against Persia, he might have been content to make relatively moderate conquests, e.g., making Anatolia into a Macedonian province, and, unlike his son Alexander, not have wanted to push further into an overall conquest of Persia and further campaigns in India.

==Tomb of Philip II at Aigai==
In 1977, Greek archaeologist Manolis Andronikos started excavating the Great Tumulus at Aigai near modern Vergina, the capital and burial site of the kings of Macedon, and found that two of the four tombs in the tumulus were undisturbed since antiquity. Moreover, these two, and particularly Tomb II, contained fabulous treasures and objects of great quality and sophistication.

Although there was much debate for some years, as suspected at the time of the discovery Tomb II has been shown to be that of Philip II as indicated by many features, including the greaves, one of which was shaped consistently to fit a leg with a misaligned tibia (Philip II was recorded as having broken his tibia). Also, the remains of the skull show damage to the right eye caused by the penetration of an object (historically recorded to be an arrow).

Two scientists who studied some of the bones claimed in 2015 that Philip was buried in Tomb I, not Tomb II. On the basis of age, knee ankylosis, and a hole matching the penetrating wound and lameness suffered by Philip, the authors of the study identified the remains of Tomb I in Vergina as those of Philip II. Tomb II instead was identified in the study as that of King Arrhidaeus and his wife Eurydice II. The Greek Ministry of Culture replied that this claim was baseless, and that the archaeological evidence shows that the ankylotic knee belongs to another body which was thrown or put into Tomb I after this had been looted, and probably between 276/5 and 250 BC. Besides this, the theory that Tomb I belonged to Philip II had previously been shown to be false.

More recent research gives further evidence that Tomb II contains the remains of Philip II.

==Legacy==

===Cult===
The heroon at Vergina in Macedonia (the ancient city of Aegae – Αἰγαί) is thought to have been dedicated to the worship of the family of Alexander the Great and may have housed the cult statue of Philip. It is probable that he was regarded as a hero or deified on his death. Though the Macedonians did not consider Philip a god, he did receive other forms of recognition from the Greeks, e.g. at Eresos (altar to Zeus Philippeios), Ephesos (his statue was placed in the temple of Artemis), and at Olympia, where the Philippeion was built.

Isocrates once wrote to Philip that if he defeated Persia, there would be nothing left for him to do but to become a god, and Demades proposed that Philip be regarded as the thirteenth god; however, there is no clear evidence that Philip was raised to the divine status accorded his son Alexander.

===Biblical reference===
Philip is mentioned in the opening verse of the deutero-canonical First Book of Maccabees.

<text>A diaper (, North American English) or a nappy (British English, Australian English, Hiberno-English) is a type of underwear that allows the wearer to urinate or defecate without using a toilet, by absorbing or containing waste products to prevent soiling of outer clothing or the external environment. When diapers become wet or soiled, they require changing, generally by a second person such as a parent or caregiver. Failure to change a diaper on a sufficiently regular basis can result in skin problems around the area covered by the diaper.

Diapers are made of cloth or synthetic disposable materials. Cloth diapers are composed of layers of fabric such as cotton, hemp, bamboo, microfiber, or even plastic fibers such as PLA or PU, and can be washed and reused multiple times. Disposable diapers contain absorbent chemicals and are thrown away after use.

Diapers are primarily worn by infants, toddlers who are not yet toilet trained, and by children who experience bedwetting. They are also used by adults under certain circumstances or with various conditions, such as incontinence. Adult users can include those of advanced age, patients bed-bound in a hospital, individuals with certain types of physical or mental disability, and people working in extreme conditions, such as astronauts. It is not uncommon for people to wear diapers under dry suits.

==History==
===Etymology===
The Middle English word &quot;diaper&quot; originally referred to a type of cloth rather than the use thereof; &quot;diaper&quot; was the term for a pattern of repeated, rhombic shapes, and later came to describe white cotton or linen fabric with this pattern. According to the Oxford Dictionary, it is a piece of soft cloth or other thick material that is folded around a baby&#x27;s bottom and between its legs to absorb and hold its body waste. The first cloth diapers consisted of a specific type of soft tissue sheet, cut into geometric shapes. The pattern visible in linen and other types of woven fabric was called &quot;diaper&quot;. This meaning of the word has been in use since the 1590s in England. By the 19th century, baby diapers were being sewn from linen, giving us the modern-day reading of the word &quot;diaper&quot;. This usage stuck in the United States and Canada following the British colonization of North America, but in the United Kingdom, the word &quot;nappy&quot; took its place. Most sources believe &quot;nappy&quot; is a diminutive form of the word napkin, which itself was originally a diminutive.

===Development===

In the 19th century, the modern diaper began to take shape and mothers in many parts of the world used cotton material, held in place with a fastening—eventually the safety pin. Cloth diapers in the United States were first mass-produced in 1887 by Maria Allen. In the UK, diapers were made out of terry towelling, often with an inner lining made out of soft muslin.

Here is an extract from &#x27;The Modern Home Doctor&#x27; written by physicians in the UK in 1935.

Nice old, soft bits of good Turkish towelling, properly washed, will make the softest of diaper coverings, inside which specially absorbent napkins (diapers), see below at 1A, soft, light, and easily washed, are contained. These should rarely be soiled once regular habits have been inculcated, especially during the night period in which it is most important to prevent habit formation
1A -(squares of butter muslin or Harrington&#x27;s packed rolls of &quot;mutton cloth&quot; in packets, sold for polishing motor-cars, would do equally well and are very cheap and soft)

Wool pants, or, once available, rubber pants, were sometimes used over the cloth diaper to prevent leakage. Doctors believed that rubber pants were harmful because they thought the rubber acted as a poultice and damaged the skin of infants. The constant problem to be overcome was diaper rash, and the infection thereof. The concern was that lack of air circulation would worsen this condition. While lack of air circulation is a factor, it was later found that poor hygiene involving inefficiently washed diapers and infrequent changes of diapers, along with allowing the baby to lie for prolonged periods of time with fecal matter in contact with the skin, were the two main causes of these problems.

In the 20th century, the disposable diaper was conceived. In the 1930s, Robinsons of Chesterfield had what were labeled &quot;Destroyable Babies Napkins&quot; listed in their catalogue for the wholesale market. In 1944, Hugo Drangel of the Swedish paper company Pauliström suggested a conceptual design which would entail the placing of sheets of paper tissue (cellulose wadding) inside the cloth diaper and rubber pants. However, cellulose wadding was rough against the skin and crumbled into balls when exposed to moisture.

In 1946, Marion Donovan used a shower curtain from her bathroom to create the &quot;Boater&quot;, a diaper cover made from army surplus nylon parachute cloth. First sold in 1949 at Saks Fifth Avenue&#x27;s flagship store in New York City, patents were later issued in 1951 to Donovan, who later sold the rights to the waterproof diaper for $1 million. Donovan also designed a paper disposable diaper, but was unsuccessful in marketing it.
In 1947, Scottish housewife Valerie Hunter Gordon started developing and making Paddi, a 2-part system consisting of a disposable pad (made of cellulose wadding covered with cotton wool) worn inside an adjustable plastic garment with press-studs/snaps. Initially, she used old parachutes for the garment. She applied for the patent in April 1948, and it was granted for the UK in October 1949. Initially, the big manufacturers were unable to see the commercial possibilities of disposable diapers. In 1948, Gordon made over 400 Paddis herself using her sewing machine at the kitchen table. Her husband had unsuccessfully approached several companies for help until he had a chance meeting with Sir Robert Robinson at a business dinner. In November 1949 Valerie Gordon signed a contract with Robinsons of Chesterfield who then went into full production. In 1950, Boots UK agreed to sell Paddi in all their branches. In 1951 the Paddi patent was granted for the US and worldwide. Shortly after that, Playtex and several other large international companies tried unsuccessfully to buy out Paddi from Robinsons. Paddi was very successful for many years until the advent of &#x27;all in one&#x27; diapers.

In Sweden, Hugo Drangel&#x27;s daughter Lil Karhola Wettergren, in 1956 elaborated her father&#x27;s original idea, by adding a garment (again making a 2-part system like Paddi). However she met the same problem, with the purchasing managers, declaring they would never allow their wives to &quot;put paper on their children.&quot;

After the Second World War, mothers increasingly wanted freedom from washing diapers so that they could work and travel, causing an increasing demand for disposable diapers.

During the 1950s, companies such as Johnson and Johnson, Kendall, Parke-Davis, Playtex, and Molnlycke entered the disposable diaper market, and in 1956, Procter &amp; Gamble began researching disposable diapers. Victor Mills, along with his project group including William Dehaas (both men who worked for the company) invented what would be trademarked &quot;Pampers&quot;. Although Pampers were conceptualized in 1959, the diapers themselves were not launched into the market until 1961. Pampers now accounts for more than $10 billion in annual revenue at Procter &amp; Gamble.

As Audrey Quinn recounts about the 1980s &quot;Diaper Wars&quot;, 
Over the next few decades, the disposable diaper industry boomed and the competition between Procter &amp; Gamble&#x27;s Pampers and Kimberly Clark&#x27;s Huggies resulted in lower prices and drastic changes to diaper design. Several improvements were made, such as the use of double gussets to improve diaper fit and containment. As stated in Procter &amp; Gamble&#x27;s initial 1973 patent for the use of double gussets in a diaper, &quot;The double gusset folded areas tend to readily conform to the thigh portions of the leg of the infant. This allows quick and easy fitting and provides a snug and comfortable diaper fit that will neither bind nor wad on the infant...as a result of this snugger fit obtained because of this fold configuration, the diaper is less likely to leak or, in other words, its containment characteristics are greatly enhanced.&quot; Further developments in diaper design were made, such as the introduction of refastenable tapes, the &quot;hourglass shape&quot; so as to reduce bulk at the crotch area, and the 1984 introduction of super-absorbent material from polymers known as sodium polyacrylate that were originally developed in 1966.

==Types==
===Disposable===

The first waterproof diaper cover was invented in 1946 by Marion Donovan, a professional-turned-housewife who wanted to ensure her children&#x27;s clothing and bedding remained dry while they slept. She also invented the first paper diapers, but executives did not invest in this idea and it was consequently scrapped for over ten years until Procter &amp; Gamble used Donovan&#x27;s design ideas to create Pampers. Another disposable diaper design was created by Valerie Hunter Gordon and patented in 1948

Ever since their introduction product innovations include the use of superabsorbent polymers, resealable tapes, and elasticised waist bands. They are now much thinner and much more absorbent. The product range has more recently been extended into children&#x27;s toilet training phase with the introduction of training pants and pant diapers, which are now undergarments.

Modern disposable baby diapers and incontinence products have a layered construction, which allows the transfer and distribution of urine to an absorbent core structure where it is locked in. Basic layers are an outer shell of breathable polyethylene film or a nonwoven and film composite which prevents wetness and soil transfer, an inner absorbent layer of a mixture of air-laid paper and superabsorbent polymers for wetness, and a layer nearest the skin of nonwoven material with a distribution layer directly beneath which will transfer wetness to the absorbent layer.

Other common features of disposable diapers include one or more pairs of either adhesive or mechanical fastening tapes to keep the diaper securely fastened. Some diapers have tapes which are refastenable to allow adjusting of fit or reapplication after inspection. Elasticized fabric single and double gussets around the leg and waist areas aid in fitting and in containing urine or stool which has not been absorbed. Baby diapers now have wetness indicators, which consist of a moisture-sensitive ink printed in the front of the diaper as either a fading design or a color-changing line to alert the carer or user that the diaper is wet.
A disposable diaper may also include an inner fabric designed to hold moisture against the skin for a brief period before absorption to alert a toilet training or bedwetting user that they have urinated. Most materials in the diaper are held together with the use of a hot-melt adhesive, which is applied in spray form or multi lines, an elastic hot melt is also used to help with pad integrity when the diaper is wet.

Some disposable diapers include fragrance, lotions or essential oils in order to help mask the smell of a soiled diaper, or to protect the skin. Care of disposable diapers is minimal, and primarily consists of keeping them in a dry place before use, with proper disposal in a garbage receptacle upon soiling. Stool is supposed to be deposited in the toilet, but is generally put in the garbage with the rest of the diaper.

Buying the right size of disposable diaper can be a little difficult for first time parents since different brands tend to have different sizing standards. Baby diaper sizes in general are based on the child&#x27;s weight (kg or lbs) and not determined by age like in clothing or shoes.

Common disposable baby diaper brands in the US include Huggies, Pampers, and Luvs.

====Sizing====
===Cloth diaper===

Cloth diapers are reusable and can be made from natural fibers, synthetic materials, or a combination of both. They are often made from industrial cotton which may be bleached white or left the fiber&#x27;s natural color. Other natural fiber cloth materials include wool, bamboo, and unbleached hemp. Man-made materials such as an internal absorbent layer of microfiber toweling or an external waterproof layer of polyurethane laminate (PUL) may be used. Polyester fleece and faux suedecloth are often used inside cloth diapers as a &quot;stay-dry&quot; wicking liner because of the non-absorbent properties of those synthetic fibers.

Traditionally, cloth diapers consisted of a folded square or rectangle of cloth, fastened with safety pins. Today, most cloth diapers are fastened with hook and loop tape (velcro) or snaps.

Modern cloth diapers come in a host of shapes, including preformed cloth diapers, all-in-one diapers with waterproof exteriors, fitted diaper with covers and pocket or &quot;stuffable&quot; diapers, which consist of a water-resistant outer shell sewn with an opening for insertion of absorbent material inserts. Many design features of modern cloth diapers have followed directly from innovations initially developed in disposable diapers, such as the use of the hour glass shape, materials to separate moisture from skin and the use of double gussets, or an inner elastic band for better fit and containment of waste material. Several cloth diaper brands use variations of Procter &amp; Gamble&#x27;s original 1973 patent use of a double gusset in Pampers.

===Compostable diapers===
Compostable diapers can be made from a range of different plant-based materials. Dyper makes their compostable diapers from bamboo fibers.

==Usage==
===Children===
Babies may have their diapers changed five or more times a day. Parents and other primary childcare givers often carry spare diapers and necessities for diaper changing in a specialized diaper bag. Diapering may possibly serve as a good bonding experience for parent and child. Children who wear diapers may experience skin irritation, commonly referred to as diaper rash, due to continual contact with fecal matter, as feces contains urease which catalyzes the conversion of the urea in urine to ammonia which can irritate the skin and can cause painful redness.

The age at which children should cease regularly wearing diapers and toilet training should begin is a subject of debate. Proponents of baby-led potty training and Elimination Communication argue that potty training can begin at birth with multiple benefits, with diapers only used as a backup. Keeping children in diapers beyond infancy can be controversial, with family psychologist John Rosemond claiming it is a &quot;slap to the intelligence of a human being that one would allow baby to continue soiling and wetting himself past age two.&quot; Pediatrician T. Berry Brazelton, however, believes that toilet training is the child&#x27;s choice and has encouraged this view in various commercials for Pampers Size 6, a diaper for older children. Brazelton warns that enforced toilet training can cause serious long-term problems, and that it is the child&#x27;s decision when to stop wearing diapers, not the parents&#x27;.

Children typically achieve daytime continence and stop wearing diapers during the day between the ages of two and four, depending on culture, diaper type, parental habits, and the child&#x27;s personality. However, it is becoming increasingly common for children five to eleven years old to still wear diapers during the day, due to the child&#x27;s opposition to toilet training, neglect, or unconventional parenting techniques. Other children may use diapers past toileting age due to disability, developmental disorders, or other medical reasons. This can pose a number of problems if the child is sent to school wearing diapers, including teasing from classmates and health issues resulting from soiled diapers. There has been recent pushback from teachers concerning a trend of more children in diapers. If a child soils themselves or their diaper, the teacher has to stop the lesson to focus on one child, which is distracting, and take away from the learning environment.

Most children continue to wear diapers at night for a period of time following daytime continence. Older children may have problems with bladder control (primarily at night) and may wear diapers while sleeping to control bedwetting. Approximately 16% of children in the U.S. over the age of 5 wet the bed, 5% of children over 10 wet the bed, and 2% of children over 15 wet the bed. Some companies have diaper products specifically designed for bedwetting, traditionally hosting higher leak guards, and being pull on style similar to training pants. If bedwetting becomes a concern, the current recommendation is to consider forgoing the use of a diaper at night as they may prevent the child from wanting to get out of bed, although this is not a primary cause of bedwetting. This is particularly the case for children over the age of 8.

====Training pants====
Manufacturers have designed &quot;training pants&quot; which bridge the gap between baby diapers and normal underwear during the toilet training process. These are similar to infant diapers in construction, but they can be pulled on like normal underwear. Training pants are available for children who experience enuresis.

===Adults===
Although most commonly worn by and associated with babies and children, diapers are also worn by adults for a variety of reasons. In the medical community, they are usually referred to as &quot;adult absorbent briefs&quot; rather than diapers, which are associated with children and may have a negative connotation. The usage of adult diapers can be a source of embarrassment, and products are often marketed under euphemisms such as incontinence pads. The most common adult users of diapers are those with medical conditions which cause them to experience urinary incontinence (like bedwetting) or fecal incontinence, those who are bedridden or otherwise limited in their mobility, or for other emotional, physical, or mental needs. It is important that the user selects the proper type, size, and absorbency level for their needs as every diaper design is different.

Scuba divers utilize diapers for their dry suits for long exposures.
The Maximum Absorbency Garment is an adult-sized diaper with extra absorption material that NASA astronauts wear during liftoff, landing, and extra-vehicular activity (EVA). The NASA Maximum Absorbency Garment is however only designed to retain 2 liters, while the commercial brand by &quot;Tykables Diapers&quot; known as their &quot;Little Rawrs&quot; diaper line is ISO rated to retain up to 7.5 liters of urine.

===Animals===
Diapers and diaperlike products are sometimes used on pets, laboratory animals, or working animals. This is often due to the animal not being housebroken, or for older, sick, or injured pets who have become incontinent. In some cases, these are simply baby diapers with holes cut for the tails to fit through. In other cases, they are diaperlike waste collection devices.

The diapers used on primates, canines, etc. are much like the diapers used by humans. The diapers used on equines are intended to catch excretions, as opposed to absorbing them.

In 2002, the Vienna city council proposed that horses be made to wear diapers to prevent them from defecating in the street. This caused controversy amongst animal rights groups, who claimed that wearing diapers would be uncomfortable for the animals. The campaigners protested by lining the streets wearing diapers themselves, which spelled out the message &quot;Stop pooh bags&quot;. In the Kenyan town of Limuru, donkeys were also diapered at the council&#x27;s behest. A similar scheme in Blackpool ordered that horses be fitted with rubber and plastic diapers to stop them littering the promenade with dung. The council consulted the RSPCA to ensure that the diapers were not harmful to the horses&#x27; welfare.

Other animals that are sometimes diapered include female dogs when ovulating and thus bleeding, and monkeys and apes or chickens. Diapers are often seen on trained animals who appear on TV shows, in movies, or for live entertainment or educational appearances.

==Cost of disposable diapers==
More than US$9 billion is spent on disposable diapers in North America each year.

As of 2018, name-brand, mid-range disposable diapers in the U.S., such as Huggies and Pampers, were sold at an average cost of approximately $0.20–0.30 each, and their manufacturers earned about two cents in profit from each diaper sold. Premium brands had eco-friendly features, and sold for approximately twice that price. Generic disposable diapers cost less per diaper, at an average price of $0.15 each, and the typical manufacturer&#x27;s profit was about one cent per diaper. However, the low-cost diapers needed to be changed more frequently, so the total cost savings was limited, as the lower cost per diaper was offset by the need to buy more diapers.

In Latin America, some manufacturers sold disposable diapers at a price of approximately US$0.10 each.

==Environmental impact of cloth versus disposable diapers==

An average child will go through several thousand diapers in their life. Since disposable diapers are discarded after a single use, usage of disposable diapers increases the burden on landfill sites, and increased environmental awareness has led to a growth in campaigns for parents to use reusable alternatives such as cloth or hybrid diapers. An estimated 27.4 billion disposable diapers are used each year in the US, resulting in a possible 3.4 million tons of used diapers adding to landfills each year. A discarded disposable diaper takes approximately 450 years to decompose.

The environmental impact of cloth as compared to disposable diapers has been studied several times. In one cradle-to-grave study sponsored by the National Association of Diaper Services (NADS) and conducted by Carl Lehrburger and colleagues, results stated that disposable diapers produce seven times more solid waste when discarded and three times more waste in the manufacturing process. In addition, effluents from the plastic, pulp, and paper industries are believed far more hazardous than those from the cotton-growing and -manufacturing processes. Single-use diapers consume less water than reusables laundered at home, but more than those sent to a commercial diaper service. Washing cloth diapers at home uses 50 to 70 gallons (approx. 189 to 264 litres) of water every three days, which is roughly equivalent to flushing the toilet 15 times a day, unless the user has a high-efficiency washing machine. An average diaper service puts its diapers through an average of 13 water changes, but uses less water and energy per diaper than one laundry load at home.

In October 2008, &quot;An updated lifecycle assessment study for disposable and reusable nappies&quot; by the UK Environment Agency and Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs stated that reusable diapers can cause significantly less (up to 40 per cent) or significantly more damage to the environment than disposable ones, depending mostly on how parents wash and dry them. The &quot;baseline scenario&quot; showed that the difference in green-house emissions was insignificant (in fact, disposables even scored slightly better). However, much better results (emission cuts of up to 40 per cent) could be achieved by using reusable diapers more rationally. &quot;The report shows that, in contrast to the use of disposable nappies, it is consumers&#x27; behaviour after purchase that determines most of the impacts from reusable nappies. Cloth nappy users can reduce their environmental impacts by:
* Line drying outside whenever possible
* Tumble drying as little as possible
* When replacing appliances, choosing more energy efficient appliances (A+ rated machines [according to the EU environmental rating] are preferred)
* Not washing above 
* Washing fuller loads
* Using baby-led potty training techniques to reduce number of soiled nappies.
* Reusing nappies on other children.&quot;

There are variations in the care of cloth diapers that can account for different measures of environmental impact. For example, using a cloth diaper laundering service involves additional pollution from the vehicle that picks up and drops off deliveries. Yet such a service uses less water per diaper in the laundering process. Some people who launder cloth diapers at home wash each load twice, considering the first wash a &quot;prewash&quot;, and thus doubling the energy and water usage from laundering. Cloth diapers are most commonly made of cotton. &quot;Conventional cotton is one of the most chemically-dependent crops, sucking up 10% of all agricultural chemicals and 25% of insecticides on 3% of our arable land; that&#x27;s more than any other crop per unit.&quot; This effect can be mitigated by using organic cotton or other materials, such as bamboo and hemp.

Another aspect to consider when choosing between disposable diapers and cloth diapers is cost. It is estimated that an average baby will use from $1,500 to $2,000 or more in disposable diapers before being potty-trained. In contrast, cloth diapers, while initially more expensive than disposables, if bought new cost about $100 to $300 for a basic set, although costs can rise with more expensive versions. The cost of washing and drying diapers must also be considered. The basic set, if one-sized, can last from birth to potty-training.

Another factor in reusable cloth diaper impact is the ability to re-use the diapers for subsequent children or sell them on. These factors can alleviate the environmental and financial impact from manufacture, sale and use of brand-new reusable diapers.

<text>The evergreen bagworm (Thyridopteryx ephemeraeformis), commonly known as [[bagworm]],
eastern bagworm, common bagworm, common basket worm, or North American bagworm, is a moth that spins its cocoon in its larval life, decorating it with bits of plant material from the trees on which it feeds.

The evergreen bagworm&#x27;s case grows to over 6 cm, tapered and open on both ends. Newborn larvae are blackish and turn brown to tan as they grow, mottled with black. The heads and thorax develop a yellow tint as they grow to a total length of 24 to 32 mm. Adult males resemble bees, having a 25 mm wingspan with transparent wings (&quot;thuris&quot; window + &quot;pterux&quot; wing) and black furry bodies. Adult females are maggot-like with yellowish-white soft bodies 19 to 23 mm long and small tufts of hair near the end of the abdomen. The cream-colored eggs are 0.75 mm in diameter.

The evergreen bagworm thrives in the eastern United States as far west as Nebraska, north into New England, and bordering the Gulf of Mexico south throughout Texas. It has been found in other countries, such as South Africa, Croatia, and in the north-east of Iran. Large populations in forested areas are rare. With scarce predators in urban areas, evergreen bagworms often thrive in urban habitats. When disturbed, the larva retracts its head into its case and closes the front opening. Mature larvae may remain in the host tree or drag their case nearby before attaching themselves for the pupa stage.

The diet of larvae consists of leaves and buds of trees. Arborvitae and red cedar are favored host trees. Cypress, juniper, pine, spruce, apple, birch, black locust, elm, maple, poplar, oak, sycamore, willow, and over 100 other species can also be eaten.

Bagworms are commonly parasitized by ichneumonid wasps, notably &quot;Itoplectis conquisitor&quot;. Predators include vespid wasps and hornets. Woodpeckers and sapsuckers can feed on the larvae from their cases.

Eggs hatch from early April to early June (earlier in the south), and larvae emerge from the carcass of their mother in her case. Newborn larvae emerge from the bottom of the hanging case and drop down on a strand of silk. The wind often blows the larva to nearby plants, beginning its new case from silk and fecal material before adding leaves and twigs from its host. When mature in mid-August, the larva wraps silk around a branch, hangs from it, and pupates head down. The silk is so strong that it can strangle and kill the branch it hangs from over several years as the branch grows. Adult males transform into moths in four weeks to seek out females for mating. The female never leaves the cocoon, requiring that the male mate with her through the open end at the back of the case. She has no eyes, legs, wings, or antennae and can&#x27;t eat, but she emits a strong pheromone to attract a mate. After her death, with hundreds to several thousand eggs still inside, her offspring hatch and pass through her body, pupal shell, and case over several months, emerging to start their cases. Later, her pupal case can be found, full of the yellow remains of eggshells.

The bagworm has a voracious appetite and is considered a serious pest. Host trees develop damaged foliage that will kill the tree if left unchecked. If caught early enough in an infestation, the cases from the previous year can be picked off by hand before the end of May. They are easiest to detect in the fall after their cases have turned brown, especially on evergreen trees. Various bacterial sprays such as Bacillus thuringiensis Bt/Spinosad and stomach insecticides such as carbaryl (Sevin) are used to control infestations.

<doc id="54210" wikidata="Q473667" url="?curid=54210" title="Greek euro coins">
<text>Greek euro coins feature a unique design for each of the eight coins. They were all designed by Georgios Stamatopoulos with the minor coins depicting Greek ships, the middle ones portraying famous Greeks and the two large denominations showing images of Greek history and mythology. All designs feature the 12 stars of the EU, the year of imprint and a tiny symbol of the Bank of Greece. Uniquely, the value of the coins is expressed on the national side in the Greek alphabet, as well as being on the common side in the Roman alphabet. The euro cent is known as the &quot;lepto&quot; (λεπτό; plural &quot;lepta&quot;, λεπτά) in Greek, a name which has also been used for the denominations of the preceding currencies of the Greek state, the phoenix and drachma.

Greece did not enter the Eurozone until 2001 and was not able to start minting coins as early as the other eleven member states, so a number of coins circulated in 2002 were not minted in Athens but in Finland (€1 and €2 – mint mark &quot;S&quot;), France (1c, 2c, 5c, 10c and 50c – mint mark &quot;F&quot;) and Spain (20c – mint mark &quot;E&quot;). The coins minted in Athens for the euro introduction in 2002, as well as all the subsequent Greek euro coins, carry only the Greek mint mark.

==Greek euro design==
For images of the common side and a detailed description of the coins, see euro coins.
==Circulating mintage quantities==
The following table shows the mintage quantity for all Greek euro coins, per denomination, per year (the numbers are represented in millions).

==Greek starter kit==

In 2001, the Bank of Greece issued starter kits for the introduction of the Euro.

==Identifying marks==


==Commemorative coins==
Greece has a good collection of euro commemorative coins, mainly in silver although a few coins have also been minted in gold. Their face value range from €10 to €200. This is mainly done as a legacy of an old national practice of minting gold and silver coins. These coins are not really intended to be used as means of payment, so generally they do not circulate. Here you can find some samples:

<text>Ganymede, or Jupiter III, is the largest and most massive natural satellite of Jupiter, and in the Solar System. Despite being the only moon in the Solar System with a substantial magnetic field, it is the largest Solar System object without a substantial atmosphere. Like Saturn&#x27;s largest moon Titan, it is larger than the planet Mercury, but has somewhat less surface gravity than Mercury, Io, or the Moon due to its lower density compared to the three. Ganymede orbits Jupiter in roughly seven days and is in a 1:2:4 orbital resonance with the moons Europa and Io, respectively.

Ganymede is composed of silicate rock and water in approximately equal proportions. It is a fully differentiated body with an iron-rich, liquid metallic core, giving it the lowest moment of inertia factor of any solid body in the Solar System. Its internal ocean potentially contains more water than all of Earth&#x27;s oceans combined. 

Ganymede&#x27;s magnetic field is probably created by convection within its core, and influenced by tidal forces from Jupiter&#x27;s far greater magnetic field. Ganymede has a thin oxygen atmosphere that includes O, O2, and possibly O3 (ozone). Atomic hydrogen is a minor atmospheric constituent. Whether Ganymede has an ionosphere associated with its atmosphere is unresolved.

Ganymede&#x27;s surface is composed of two main types of terrain, the first of which are lighter regions, generally crosscut by extensive grooves and ridges, dating from slightly less than 4 billion years ago, covering two-thirds of Ganymede. The cause of the light terrain&#x27;s disrupted geology is not fully known, but may be the result of tectonic activity due to tidal heating. The second terrain type are darker regions saturated with impact craters, which are dated to four billion years ago.

Ganymede&#x27;s discovery is credited to Simon Marius and Galileo Galilei, who both observed it in 1610, as the third of the Galilean moons, the first group of objects discovered orbiting another planet. Its name was soon suggested by astronomer Simon Marius, after the mythological Ganymede, a Trojan prince desired by Zeus (the Greek counterpart of Jupiter), who carried him off to be the cupbearer of the gods.

Beginning with &quot;Pioneer 10&quot;, several spacecraft have explored Ganymede. The Voyager probes, &quot;Voyager 1&quot; and &quot;Voyager 2&quot;, refined measurements of its size, while &quot;Galileo&quot; discovered its underground ocean and magnetic field. The next planned mission to the Jovian system is the European Space Agency&#x27;s Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE), which was launched in 2023. After flybys of all three icy Galilean moons, it is planned to enter orbit around Ganymede.

==History==
Chinese astronomical records report that in 365 BC, Gan De detected what might have been a moon of Jupiter, probably Ganymede, with the naked eye. However, Gan De reported the color of the companion as reddish, which is puzzling since moons are too faint for their color to be perceived with the naked eye. Shi Shen and Gan De together made fairly accurate observations of the five major planets.

On January 7, 1610, Galileo Galilei used a telescope to observe what he thought were three stars near Jupiter, including what turned out to be Ganymede, Callisto, and one body that turned out to be the combined light from Io and Europa; the next night he noticed that they had moved. On January 13, he saw all four at once for the first time, but had seen each of the moons before this date at least once. By January 15, Galileo concluded that the stars were actually bodies orbiting Jupiter.

==Name==
Galileo claimed the right to name the moons he had discovered. He considered &quot;Cosmian Stars&quot; and settled on &quot;Medicean Stars&quot;, in honor of Cosimo II de&#x27; Medici.

The French astronomer Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc suggested individual names from the Medici family for the moons, but his proposal was not taken up. Simon Marius, who had originally claimed to have found the Galilean satellites, tried to name the moons the &quot;Saturn of Jupiter&quot;, the &quot;Jupiter of Jupiter&quot; (this was Ganymede), the &quot;Venus of Jupiter&quot;, and the &quot;Mercury of Jupiter&quot;, another nomenclature that never caught on. Later on, after finding out about a suggestion from Johannes Kepler, Marius agreed with Kepler&#x27;s proposal and so he then proposed a naming system based on Greek mythology instead. This final Kepler/Marius proposal was ultimately successful.

This name and those of the other Galilean satellites fell into disfavor for a considerable time, and were not in common use until the mid-20th century. In much of the earlier astronomical literature, Ganymede is referred to instead by its Roman numeral designation, (a system introduced by Galileo), in other words &quot;the third satellite of Jupiter&quot;. Following the discovery of moons of Saturn, a naming system based on that of Kepler and Marius was used for Jupiter&#x27;s moons. Ganymede is the only Galilean moon of Jupiter named after a male figure—like Io, Europa, and Callisto, he was a lover of Zeus.

In English, the Galilean satellites Io, Europa and Callisto have the Latin spellings of their names, but the Latin form of Ganymede is &quot;Ganymēdēs&quot;, which would be pronounced . However, the final syllable is dropped in English, perhaps under the influence of French &quot;Ganymède&quot; ().

==Orbit and rotation==
Ganymede orbits Jupiter at a distance of , third among the Galilean satellites, and completes a revolution every seven days and three hours (7.155 days). Like most known moons, Ganymede is tidally locked, with one side always facing toward the planet, hence its day is also seven days and three hours. Its orbit is very slightly eccentric and inclined to the Jovian equator, with the eccentricity and inclination changing quasi-periodically due to solar and planetary gravitational perturbations on a timescale of centuries. The ranges of change are 0.0009–0.0022 and 0.05–0.32°, respectively. These orbital variations cause the axial tilt (the angle between the rotational and orbital axes) to vary between 0 and 0.33°.

Ganymede participates in orbital resonances with Europa and Io: for every orbit of Ganymede, Europa orbits twice and Io orbits four times. Conjunctions (alignment on the same side of Jupiter) between Io and Europa occur when Io is at periapsis and Europa at apoapsis. Conjunctions between Europa and Ganymede occur when Europa is at periapsis. The longitudes of the Io–Europa and Europa–Ganymede conjunctions change at the same rate, making triple conjunctions impossible. Such a complicated resonance is called the Laplace resonance.
The current Laplace resonance is unable to pump the orbital eccentricity of Ganymede to a higher value. The value of about 0.0013 is probably a remnant from a previous epoch, when such pumping was possible. The Ganymedian orbital eccentricity is somewhat puzzling; if it is not pumped now it should have decayed long ago due to the tidal dissipation in the interior of Ganymede. This means that the last episode of the eccentricity excitation happened only several hundred million years ago. Because Ganymede&#x27;s orbital eccentricity is relatively low—on average 0.0015—tidal heating is negligible now. However, in the past Ganymede may have passed through one or more Laplace-like resonances that were able to pump the orbital eccentricity to a value as high as 0.01–0.02. This probably caused a significant tidal heating of the interior of Ganymede; the formation of the grooved terrain may be a result of one or more heating episodes.

There are two hypotheses for the origin of the Laplace resonance among Io, Europa, and Ganymede: that it is primordial and has existed from the beginning of the Solar System; or that it developed after the formation of the Solar System. A possible sequence of events for the latter scenario is as follows: Io raised tides on Jupiter, causing Io&#x27;s orbit to expand (due to conservation of momentum) until it encountered the 2:1 resonance with Europa; after that, the expansion continued, but some of the angular moment was transferred to Europa as the resonance caused its orbit to expand as well; the process continued until Europa encountered the 2:1 resonance with Ganymede. Eventually the drift rates of conjunctions between all three moons were synchronized and locked in the Laplace resonance.

==Physical characteristics==

===Size===

With a diameter of about and a mass of , Ganymede is the largest and most massive moon in the Solar System. It is slightly more massive than the second most massive moon, Saturn&#x27;s satellite Titan, and is more than twice as massive as the Earth&#x27;s Moon. It is larger than the planet Mercury, which has a diameter of but is only 45 percent of Mercury&#x27;s mass. Ganymede is the ninth-largest object in the solar system, but the tenth-most massive.

===Composition===
The average density of Ganymede, 1.936 g/cm3 (a bit greater than Callisto&#x27;s), suggests a composition of about equal parts rocky material and mostly water ices. Some of the water is liquid, forming an underground ocean. The mass fraction of ices is between 46 and 50 percent, which is slightly lower than that in Callisto. Some additional volatile ices such as ammonia may also be present. The exact composition of Ganymede&#x27;s rock is not known, but is probably close to the composition of L/LL type ordinary chondrites, which are characterized by less total iron, less metallic iron and more iron oxide than H chondrites. The weight ratio of iron to silicon ranges between 1.05 and 1.27 in Ganymede, whereas the solar ratio is around 1.8.

===Surface features===



Ganymede&#x27;s surface has an albedo of about 43 percent. Water ice seems to be ubiquitous on its surface, with a mass fraction of 50–90 percent, significantly more than in Ganymede as a whole. Near-infrared spectroscopy has revealed the presence of strong water ice absorption bands at wavelengths of 1.04, 1.25, 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0 μm. The grooved terrain is brighter and has a more icy composition than the dark terrain. The analysis of high-resolution, near-infrared and UV spectra obtained by the &quot;Galileo&quot; spacecraft and from Earth observations has revealed various non-water materials: carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and, possibly, cyanogen, hydrogen sulfate and various organic compounds. &quot;Galileo&quot; results have also shown magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) and, possibly, sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) on Ganymede&#x27;s surface. These salts may originate from the subsurface ocean.
The Ganymedian surface albedo is very asymmetric; the leading hemisphere is brighter than the trailing one. This is similar to Europa, but the reverse for Callisto. The trailing hemisphere of Ganymede appears to be enriched in sulfur dioxide. The distribution of carbon dioxide does not demonstrate any hemispheric asymmetry, but little or no carbon dioxide is observed near the poles. Impact craters on Ganymede (except one) do not show any enrichment in carbon dioxide, which also distinguishes it from Callisto. Ganymede&#x27;s carbon dioxide gas was probably depleted in the past.
Ganymede&#x27;s surface is a mix of two types of terrain: very old, highly cratered, dark regions and somewhat younger (but still ancient), lighter regions marked with an extensive array of grooves and ridges. The dark terrain, which comprises about one-third of the surface, contains clays and organic materials that could indicate the composition of the impactors from which Jovian satellites accreted.

The heating mechanism required for the formation of the grooved terrain on Ganymede is an unsolved problem in the planetary sciences. The modern view is that the grooved terrain is mainly tectonic in nature. Cryovolcanism is thought to have played only a minor role, if any. The forces that caused the strong stresses in the Ganymedian ice lithosphere necessary to initiate the tectonic activity may be connected to the tidal heating events in the past, possibly caused when the satellite passed through unstable orbital resonances. The tidal flexing of the ice may have heated the interior and strained the lithosphere, leading to the development of cracks and horst and graben faulting, which erased the old, dark terrain on 70 percent of the surface. The formation of the grooved terrain may also be connected with the early core formation and subsequent tidal heating of Ganymede&#x27;s interior, which may have caused a slight expansion of Ganymede by one to six percent due to phase transitions in ice and thermal expansion. During subsequent evolution deep, hot water plumes may have risen from the core to the surface, leading to the tectonic deformation of the lithosphere. Radiogenic heating within the satellite is the most relevant current heat source, contributing, for instance, to ocean depth. Research models have found that if the orbital eccentricity were an order of magnitude greater than currently (as it may have been in the past), tidal heating would be a more substantial heat source than radiogenic heating.

Cratering is seen on both types of terrain, but is especially extensive on the dark terrain: it appears to be saturated with impact craters and has evolved largely through impact events. The brighter, grooved terrain contains many fewer impact features, which have been only of minor importance to its tectonic evolution. The density of cratering indicates an age of 4 billion years for the dark terrain, similar to the highlands of the Moon, and a somewhat younger age for the grooved terrain (but how much younger is uncertain). Ganymede may have experienced a period of heavy cratering 3.5 to 4 billion years ago similar to that of the Moon. If true, the vast majority of impacts happened in that epoch, whereas the cratering rate has been much smaller since. Craters both overlay and are crosscut by the groove systems, indicating that some of the grooves are quite ancient. Relatively young craters with rays of ejecta are also visible. Ganymedian craters are flatter than those on the Moon and Mercury. This is probably due to the relatively weak nature of Ganymede&#x27;s icy crust, which can (or could) flow and thereby soften the relief. Ancient craters whose relief has disappeared leave only a &quot;ghost&quot; of a crater known as a palimpsest.

One significant feature on Ganymede is a dark plain named Galileo Regio, which contains a series of concentric grooves, or furrows, likely created during a period of geologic activity.

Ganymede also has polar caps, likely composed of water frost. The frost extends to 40° latitude. These polar caps were first seen by the &quot;Voyager&quot; spacecraft. Theories on the formation of the caps include the migration of water to higher latitudes and the bombardment of the ice by plasma. Data from &quot;Galileo&quot; suggests the latter is correct. The presence of a magnetic field on Ganymede results in more intense charged particle bombardment of its surface in the unprotected polar regions; sputtering then leads to redistribution of water molecules, with frost migrating to locally colder areas within the polar terrain.

A crater named Anat provides the reference point for measuring longitude on Ganymede. By definition, Anat is at 128° longitude. The 0° longitude directly faces Jupiter, and unless stated otherwise longitude increases toward the west.

===Internal structure===
Ganymede appears to be fully differentiated, with an internal structure consisting of an iron-sulfide–iron core, a silicate mantle, and outer layers of water ice and liquid water.
 The precise thicknesses of the different layers in the interior of Ganymede depend on the assumed composition of silicates (fraction of olivine and pyroxene) and amount of sulfur in the core. Ganymede has the lowest moment of inertia factor, 0.31, among the solid Solar System bodies. This is a consequence of its substantial water content and fully differentiated interior.

====Subsurface oceans====

In the 1970s, NASA scientists first suspected that Ganymede had a thick ocean between two layers of ice, one on the surface and one beneath a liquid ocean and atop the rocky mantle. In the 1990s, NASA&#x27;s &quot;Galileo&quot; mission flew by Ganymede, and found indications of such a subsurface ocean. An analysis published in 2014, taking into account the realistic thermodynamics for water and effects of salt, suggests that Ganymede might have a stack of several ocean layers separated by different phases of ice, with the lowest liquid layer adjacent to the rocky mantle. Water–rock contact may be an important factor in the origin of life. The analysis also notes that the extreme depths involved (~800 km to the rocky &quot;seafloor&quot;) mean that temperatures at the bottom of a convective (adiabatic) ocean can be up to 40 K higher than those at the ice–water interface.

In March 2015, scientists reported that measurements with the Hubble Space Telescope of how the aurorae moved confirmed that Ganymede has a subsurface ocean. A large saltwater ocean affects Ganymede&#x27;s magnetic field, and consequently, its aurorae. The evidence suggests that Ganymede&#x27;s oceans might be the largest in the entire Solar System. These observations were later supported by &quot;Juno&quot;, which detected various salts and other compounds on Ganymede&#x27;s surface, including hydrated sodium chloride, ammonium chloride, sodium bicarbonate, and possibly aliphatic aldehydes. These compounds were potentially deposited from Ganymede&#x27;s ocean in past resurfacing events and were discovered to be most abundant in Ganymede&#x27;s lower latitudes, shielded by its small magnetosphere. As a result of these findings, there is increasing speculation on the potential habitability of Ganymede&#x27;s ocean.

====Core====
The existence of a liquid, iron–nickel-rich core provides a natural explanation for the intrinsic magnetic field of Ganymede detected by &quot;Galileo&quot; spacecraft. The convection in the liquid iron, which has high electrical conductivity, is the most reasonable model of magnetic field generation. The density of the core is 5.5–6 g/cm3 and the silicate mantle is 3.4–3.6 g/cm3. The radius of this core may be up to 500 km. The temperature in the core of Ganymede is probably 1500–1700 K and pressure up to .

===Atmosphere and ionosphere===
In 1972, a team of Indian, British and American astronomers working in Java, Indonesia and Kavalur, India claimed that they had detected a thin atmosphere during an occultation, when it and Jupiter passed in front of a star. They estimated that the surface pressure was around 0.1 Pa (1 microbar). However, in 1979, &quot;Voyager 1&quot; observed an occultation of the star κ Centauri during its flyby of Jupiter, with differing results. The occultation measurements were conducted in the far-ultraviolet spectrum at wavelengths shorter than 200 nm, which were much more sensitive to the presence of gases than the 1972 measurements made in the visible spectrum. No atmosphere was revealed by the &quot;Voyager&quot; data. The upper limit on the surface particle number density was found to be , which corresponds to a surface pressure of less than 2.5 μPa (25 picobar). The latter value is almost five orders of magnitude less than the 1972 estimate.

Despite the &quot;Voyager&quot; data, evidence for a tenuous oxygen atmosphere (exosphere) on Ganymede, very similar to the one found on Europa, was found by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in 1995. HST actually observed airglow of atomic oxygen in the far-ultraviolet at the wavelengths 130.4 nm and 135.6 nm. Such an airglow is excited when molecular oxygen is dissociated by electron impacts, which is evidence of a significant neutral atmosphere composed predominantly of O2 molecules. The surface number density probably lies in the range, corresponding to the surface pressure of . These values are in agreement with &quot;Voyager&quot;&#x27;s upper limit set in 1981. The oxygen is not evidence of life; it is thought to be produced when water ice on Ganymede&#x27;s surface is split into hydrogen and oxygen by radiation, with the hydrogen then being more rapidly lost due to its low atomic mass. The airglow observed over Ganymede is not spatially homogeneous like that observed over Europa. HST observed two bright spots located in the northern and southern hemispheres, near ± 50° latitude, which is exactly the boundary between the open and closed field lines of the Ganymedian magnetosphere (see below). The bright spots are probably polar auroras, caused by plasma precipitation along the open field lines.

The existence of a neutral atmosphere implies that an ionosphere should exist, because oxygen molecules are ionized by the impacts of the energetic electrons coming from the magnetosphere and by solar EUV radiation. However, the nature of the Ganymedian ionosphere is as controversial as the nature of the atmosphere. Some &quot;Galileo&quot; measurements found an elevated electron density near Ganymede, suggesting an ionosphere, whereas others failed to detect anything. The electron density near the surface is estimated by different sources to lie in the range 400–2,500 cm−3. As of 2008, the parameters of the ionosphere of Ganymede were not well constrained.

Additional evidence of the oxygen atmosphere comes from spectral detection of gases trapped in the ice at the surface of Ganymede. The detection of ozone (O3) bands was announced in 1996. In 1997 spectroscopic analysis revealed the dimer (or diatomic) absorption features of molecular oxygen. Such an absorption can arise only if the oxygen is in a dense phase. The best candidate is molecular oxygen trapped in ice. The depth of the dimer absorption bands depends on latitude and longitude, rather than on surface albedo—they tend to decrease with increasing latitude on Ganymede, whereas O3 shows an opposite trend. Laboratory work has found that O2 would not cluster or bubble but would dissolve in ice at Ganymede&#x27;s relatively warm surface temperature of 100 K (−173.15 °C).

A search for sodium in the atmosphere, just after such a finding on Europa, turned up nothing in 1997. Sodium is at least 13 times less abundant around Ganymede than around Europa, possibly because of a relative deficiency at the surface or because the magnetosphere fends off energetic particles. Another minor constituent of the Ganymedian atmosphere is atomic hydrogen. Hydrogen atoms were observed as far as 3,000 km from Ganymede&#x27;s surface. Their density on the surface is about .

In 2021, water vapour was detected in the atmosphere of Ganymede.

===Magnetosphere===

The &quot;Galileo&quot; craft made six close flybys of Ganymede from 1995 to 2000 (G1, G2, G7, G8, G28 and G29) and discovered that Ganymede has a permanent (intrinsic) magnetic moment independent of the Jovian magnetic field. The value of the moment is about , which is three times larger than the magnetic moment of Mercury. The magnetic dipole is tilted with respect to the rotational axis of Ganymede by 176°, which means that it is directed against the Jovian magnetic moment. Its north pole lies below the orbital plane. The dipole magnetic field created by this permanent moment has a strength of 719 ± 2 nT at Ganymede&#x27;s equator, which should be compared with the Jovian magnetic field at the distance of Ganymede—about 120 nT. The equatorial field of Ganymede is directed against the Jovian field, meaning reconnection is possible. The intrinsic field strength at the poles is two times that at the equator—1440 nT.

The permanent magnetic moment carves a part of space around Ganymede, creating a tiny magnetosphere embedded inside that of Jupiter; it is the only moon in the Solar System known to possess the feature. Its diameter is 4–5 Ganymede radii. The Ganymedian magnetosphere has a region of closed field lines located below 30° latitude, where charged particles (electrons and ions) are trapped, creating a kind of radiation belt. The main ion species in the magnetosphere is single ionized oxygen (O+) which fits well with Ganymede&#x27;s tenuous oxygen atmosphere. In the polar cap regions, at latitudes higher than 30°, magnetic field lines are open, connecting Ganymede with Jupiter&#x27;s ionosphere. In these areas, the energetic (tens and hundreds of kiloelectronvolt) electrons and ions have been detected, which may cause the auroras observed around the Ganymedian poles. In addition, heavy ions precipitate continuously on Ganymede&#x27;s polar surface, sputtering and darkening the ice.

The interaction between the Ganymedian magnetosphere and Jovian plasma is in many respects similar to that of the solar wind and Earth&#x27;s magnetosphere. The plasma co-rotating with Jupiter impinges on the trailing side of the Ganymedian magnetosphere much like the solar wind impinges on the Earth&#x27;s magnetosphere. The main difference is the speed of plasma flow—supersonic in the case of Earth and subsonic in the case of Ganymede. Because of the subsonic flow, there is no bow shock off the trailing hemisphere of Ganymede.

In addition to the intrinsic magnetic moment, Ganymede has an induced dipole magnetic field. Its existence is connected with the variation of the Jovian magnetic field near Ganymede. The induced moment is directed radially to or from Jupiter following the direction of the varying part of the planetary magnetic field. The induced magnetic moment is an order of magnitude weaker than the intrinsic one. The field strength of the induced field at the magnetic equator is about 60 nT—half of that of the ambient Jovian field. The induced magnetic field of Ganymede is similar to those of Callisto and Europa, indicating that Ganymede also has a subsurface water ocean with a high electrical conductivity.

Given that Ganymede is completely differentiated and has a metallic core, its intrinsic magnetic field is probably generated in a similar fashion to the Earth&#x27;s: as a result of conducting material moving in the interior. The magnetic field detected around Ganymede is likely to be caused by compositional convection in the core, if the magnetic field is the product of dynamo action, or magnetoconvection.

Despite the presence of an iron core, Ganymede&#x27;s magnetosphere remains enigmatic, particularly given that similar bodies lack the feature. Some research has suggested that, given its relatively small size, the core ought to have sufficiently cooled to the point where fluid motions, hence a magnetic field would not be sustained. One explanation is that the same orbital resonances proposed to have disrupted the surface also allowed the magnetic field to persist: with Ganymede&#x27;s eccentricity pumped and tidal heating of the mantle increased during such resonances, reducing heat flow from the core, leaving it fluid and convective. Another explanation is a remnant magnetization of silicate rocks in the mantle, which is possible if the satellite had a more significant dynamo-generated field in the past.

===Radiation environment===
The radiation level at the surface of Ganymede is considerably lower than on Europa, being 50–80 mSv (5–8 rem) per day, an amount that would cause severe illness or death in human beings exposed for two months.

==Origin and evolution==

Ganymede probably formed by an accretion in Jupiter&#x27;s subnebula, a disk of gas and dust surrounding Jupiter after its formation. The accretion of Ganymede probably took about 10,000 years, much shorter than the 100,000 years estimated for Callisto. The Jovian subnebula may have been relatively &quot;gas-starved&quot; when the Galilean satellites formed; this would have allowed for the lengthy accretion times required for Callisto. In contrast, Ganymede formed closer to Jupiter, where the subnebula was denser, which explains its shorter formation timescale. This relatively fast formation prevented the escape of accretional heat, which may have led to ice melt and differentiation: the separation of the rocks and ice. The rocks settled to the center, forming the core. In this respect, Ganymede is different from Callisto, which apparently failed to melt and differentiate early due to loss of the accretional heat during its slower formation. This hypothesis explains why the two Jovian moons look so dissimilar, despite their similar mass and composition. Alternative theories explain Ganymede&#x27;s greater internal heating on the basis of tidal flexing or more intense pummeling by impactors during the Late Heavy Bombardment. In the latter case, modeling suggests that differentiation would become a runaway process at Ganymede but not Callisto.

After formation, Ganymede&#x27;s core largely retained the heat accumulated during accretion and differentiation, only slowly releasing it to the ice mantle. The mantle, in turn, transported it to the surface by convection. The decay of radioactive elements within rocks further heated the core, causing increased differentiation: an inner, iron–iron-sulfide core and a silicate mantle formed. With this, Ganymede became a fully differentiated body. By comparison, the radioactive heating of undifferentiated Callisto caused convection in its icy interior, which effectively cooled it and prevented large-scale melting of ice and rapid differentiation. The convective motions in Callisto have caused only a partial separation of rock and ice. Today, Ganymede continues to cool slowly. The heat being released from its core and silicate mantle enables the subsurface ocean to exist, whereas the slow cooling of the liquid Fe–FeS core causes convection and supports magnetic field generation. The current heat flux out of Ganymede is probably higher than that out of Callisto.

A study from 2020 by Hirata, Suetsugu and Ohtsuki suggests that Ganymede probably was hit by a massive asteroid 4 billion years ago; an impact so violent that may have shifted the moon&#x27;s axis. The study came to this conclusion analyzing images of the furrows system in the satellite&#x27;s surface.

==Exploration==

Several spacecraft have performed close flybys of Ganymede: two &quot;Pioneer&quot; and two &quot;Voyager&quot; spacecraft made a single flyby each between 1973 and 1979; the &quot;Galileo&quot; spacecraft made six passes between 1996 and 2000; and the &quot;Juno&quot; spacecraft performed two flybys in 2019 and 2021. No spacecraft has yet orbited Ganymede, but the JUICE mission, which launched in April 2023, intends to do so.

===Completed flybys===

The first spacecraft to approach close to Ganymede was &quot;Pioneer 10&quot;, which performed a flyby in 1973 as it passed through the Jupiter system at high speed. &quot;Pioneer 11&quot; made a similar flyby in 1974. Data sent back by the two spacecraft was used to determine the moon&#x27;s physical characteristics and provided images of the surface with up to resolution. Pioneer 10&#x27;s closest approach was 446,250 km, about 85 times Ganymede&#x27;s diameter.

&quot;Voyager 1&quot; and &quot;Voyager 2&quot; both studied Ganymede when passing through the Jupiter system in 1979. Data from those flybys were used to refine the size of Ganymede, revealing it was larger than Saturn&#x27;s moon Titan, which was previously thought to have been bigger. Images from the &quot;Voyagers&quot; provided the first views of the moon&#x27;s grooved surface terrain.

The &quot;Pioneer&quot; and &quot;Voyager&quot; flybys were all at large distances and high speeds, as they flew on unbound trajectories through the Jupiter system. Better data can be obtained from a spacecraft which is orbiting Jupiter, as it can encounter Ganymede at a lower speed and adjust the orbit for a closer approach. In 1995, the &quot;Galileo&quot; spacecraft entered orbit around Jupiter and between 1996 and 2000 made six close flybys of Ganymede. These flybys were denoted G1, G2, G7, G8, G28 and G29. During the closest flyby (G2), &quot;Galileo&quot; passed just 264 km from the surface of Ganymede (five percent of the moon&#x27;s diameter), which remains the closest approach by any spacecraft. During the G1 flyby in 1996, &quot;Galileo&quot; instruments detected Ganymede&#x27;s magnetic field. Data from the &quot;Galileo&quot; flybys was used to discover the sub-surface ocean, which was announced in 2001. High spatial resolution spectra of Ganymede taken by &quot;Galileo&quot; were used to identify several non-ice compounds on the surface.

The &quot;New Horizons&quot; spacecraft also observed Ganymede, but from a much larger distance as it passed through the Jupiter system in 2007 (en route to Pluto). The data were used to perform topographic and compositional mapping of Ganymede.

Like &quot;Galileo&quot;, the &quot;Juno&quot; spacecraft orbited Jupiter. On 2019 December 25, &quot;Juno&quot; performed a distant flyby of Ganymede during its 24th orbit of Jupiter, at a range of . This flyby provided images of the moon&#x27;s polar regions. In June 2021, &quot;Juno&quot; performed a second flyby, at a closer distance of . This encounter was designed to provide a gravity assist to reduce &quot;Juno&quot;&#x27;s orbital period from 53 days to 43 days. Additional images of the surface were collected.

===Future missions===
The Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) will be the first to enter orbit around Ganymede itself. JUICE was launched on April 14, 2023. It is intended to perform its first flyby of Ganymede in 2031, then enter orbit of the moon in 2032. When the spacecraft consumes its propellant, JUICE is planned to be deorbited and impact Ganymede in February 2034.

In addition to JUICE, NASA&#x27;s Europa Clipper, which was launched in October 2024, will conduct 4 close flybys of Ganymede beginning in 2030. It may also crash into Ganymede at the end of its mission to aid JUICE in studying the surface&#x27;s geochemistry.

===Cancelled proposals===
Several other missions have been proposed to flyby or orbit Ganymede, but were either not selected for funding or cancelled before launch.

The Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter would have studied Ganymede in greater detail. However, the mission was canceled in 2005. Another old proposal was called The Grandeur of Ganymede.

A Ganymede orbiter based on the &quot;Juno&quot; probe was proposed in 2010 for the Planetary Science Decadal Survey. The mission was not supported, with the Decadal Survey preferring the Europa Clipper mission instead.

The Europa Jupiter System Mission had a proposed launch date of 2020, and was a joint NASA and ESA proposal for exploration of many of Jupiter&#x27;s moons including Ganymede. In February 2009 it was announced that ESA and NASA had given this mission priority ahead of the Titan Saturn System Mission. The mission was to consist of the NASA-led Jupiter Europa Orbiter, the ESA-led Jupiter Ganymede Orbiter, and possibly a JAXA-led Jupiter Magnetospheric Orbiter. The NASA and JAXA components were later cancelled, and ESA&#x27;s appeared likely to be cancelled too, but in 2012 ESA announced it would go ahead alone. The European part of the mission became the Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer (JUICE).

The Russian Space Research Institute proposed a Ganymede lander astrobiology mission called Laplace-P, possibly in partnership with JUICE. If selected, it would have been launched in 2023. The mission was cancelled due to a lack of funding in 2017.

<text>Dutch euro coins currently use two designs by Erwin Olaf, both of which feature a portrait of King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands. The new designs began circulating in 2014. Dutch Euro coins minted from 1999 to 2013 feature a portrait of Queen Beatrix designed by Bruno Ninaber van Eyben. All coins share the 12 stars of the EU and the year of imprint in their design.

As is the case in Finland, most Dutch shops have elected not to issue one and two cent coins starting on 1 September 2004, though the coins remain legal tender. Sums are rounded to the nearest five cents; sums ending in 1, 2, 6 or 7 cents are rounded down, and those ending in 3, 4, 8 or 9 cents are rounded up. The rounding is applied to the grand total only, while individual prices are still shown and summed up with €0.01 precision. This method is known as &quot;Swedish rounding&quot;.

==Dutch euro design==
For images of the common side and a detailed description of the coins, see euro coins.

===First series (1999–2013): Queen Beatrix===

===Second series (2014–present): King Willem Alexander===
Following the accession to the throne of King Willem-Alexander, a new series of euro coins was issued depicting the effigy of the new Head of State.

==Circulating mintage quantities==

== Changes to national sides ==

The Commission of the European Communities issued a recommendation on 19 December 2008, a common guideline for the national sides and the issuance of euro coins intended for circulation. One section of this recommendation stipulates that:

:Article 4. Design of the national sides:
::&quot;The national side of the euro coins intended for circulation should bear the 12 European stars that should fully surround the national design, including the year mark and the indication of the issuing Member State&#x27;s name. The European stars should be depicted as on the European flag.&quot;

The first series of the Dutch euro coins did not comply with this recommendation. No efforts were made to amend these coins to make them compliant.

===King Willem Alexander===
Queen Beatrix abdicated on 30 April 2013, so the design of the coins was changed for her heir, King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands. The new coins were made to be in accordance with this recommendation.
The Royal Dutch Mint presented the new design to the public on 31 October 2013 and began releasing them into circulation in early 2014 (see ).
Production of the new coins commenced on 22 January 2014. The first coins were released into circulation the next day.

<doc id="54217" wikidata="Q188276" url="?curid=54217" title="Pigeonhole principle">
<text>In mathematics, the pigeonhole principle states that if items are put into containers, with , then at least one container must contain more than one item. For example, of three gloves, at least two must be right-handed or at least two must be left-handed, because there are three objects but only two categories of handedness to put them into. This seemingly obvious statement, a type of counting argument, can be used to demonstrate possibly unexpected results. For example, given that the population of London is more than one unit greater than the maximum number of hairs that can be on a human&#x27;s head, the principle requires that there must be at least two people in London who have the same number of hairs on their heads.

Although the pigeonhole principle appears as early as 1624 in a book attributed to Jean Leurechon, it is commonly called Dirichlet&#x27;s box principle or Dirichlet&#x27;s drawer principle after an 1834 treatment of the principle by Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet under the name (&quot;drawer principle&quot; or &quot;shelf principle&quot;).

The principle has several generalizations and can be stated in various ways. In a more quantified version: for natural numbers and , if objects are distributed among sets, the pigeonhole principle asserts that at least one of the sets will contain at least objects. For arbitrary and , this generalizes to formula_1, where formula_2 and formula_3 denote the floor and ceiling functions, respectively.

Though the principle&#x27;s most straightforward application is to finite sets (such as pigeons and boxes), it is also used with infinite sets that cannot be put into one-to-one correspondence. To do so requires the formal statement of the pigeonhole principle: &quot;there does not exist an injective function whose codomain is smaller than its domain&quot;. Advanced mathematical proofs like Siegel&#x27;s lemma build upon this more general concept.

==Etymology==
Dirichlet published his works in both French and German, using either the German or the French . The strict original meaning of these terms corresponds to the English &quot;&quot;, that is, an &quot;open-topped box that can be slid in and out of the cabinet that contains it&quot;. (Dirichlet wrote about distributing pearls among drawers.) These terms morphed to &quot;pigeonhole&quot; in the sense of a &quot;small open space in a desk, cabinet, or wall for keeping letters or papers&quot;, metaphorically rooted in structures that house pigeons.

Because furniture with pigeonholes is commonly used for storing or sorting things into many categories (such as letters in a post office or room keys in a hotel), the translation &quot;pigeonhole&quot; may be a better rendering of Dirichlet&#x27;s original &quot;drawer&quot;. That understanding of the term &quot;pigeonhole&quot;, referring to some furniture features, is fading—especially among those who do not speak English natively but as a lingua franca in the scientific world—in favor of the more pictorial interpretation, literally involving pigeons and holes. The suggestive (though not misleading) interpretation of &quot;pigeonhole&quot; as &quot;dovecote&quot; has lately found its way back to a German back-translation of the &quot;pigeonhole principle&quot; as the &quot;.

Besides the original terms &quot; in German and &quot; in French, other literal translations are still in use in Arabic (), Bulgarian (&quot;), Chinese (&quot;), Danish (&quot;), Dutch (&quot;), Hungarian (&quot;), Italian (&quot;), Japanese (&quot;), Persian (&quot;), Polish (&quot;), Portuguese (&quot;), Swedish (&quot;), Turkish (&quot;), and Vietnamese (&quot;).

== Examples ==

=== Sock picking ===
Suppose a drawer contains a mixture of black socks and blue socks, each of which can be worn on either foot. You pull a number of socks from the drawer without looking. What is the minimum number of pulled socks required to guarantee a pair of the same color? By the pigeonhole principle (, using one pigeonhole per color), the answer is three ( items). Either you have &quot;three&quot; of one color, or you have &quot;two&quot; of one color and &quot;one&quot; of the other.

=== Hand shaking ===
If people can shake hands with one another (where ), the pigeonhole principle shows that there is always a pair of people who will shake hands with the same number of people. In this application of the principle, the &quot;hole&quot; to which a person is assigned is the number of hands that person shakes. Since each person shakes hands with some number of people from 0 to , there are possible holes. On the other hand, either the &quot;0&quot; hole, the hole, or both must be empty, for it is impossible (if ) for some person to shake hands with everybody else while some person shakes hands with nobody. This leaves people to be placed into at most non-empty holes, so the principle applies.

This hand-shaking example is equivalent to the statement that in any graph with more than one vertex, there is at least one pair of vertices that share the same degree. This can be seen by associating each person with a vertex and each edge with a handshake.

=== Hair counting ===
One can demonstrate there must be at least two people in London with the same number of hairs on their heads as follows. Since a typical human head has an average of around 150,000 hairs, it is reasonable to assume (as an upper bound) that no one has more than 1,000,000 hairs on their head holes). There are more than 1,000,000 people in London ( is bigger than 1 million items). Assigning a pigeonhole to each number of hairs on a person&#x27;s head, and assigning people to pigeonholes according to the number of hairs on their heads, there must be at least two people assigned to the same pigeonhole by the 1,000,001st assignment (because they have the same number of hairs on their heads; or, ). Assuming London has 9.002 million people, it follows that at least ten Londoners have the same number of hairs, as having nine Londoners in each of the 1 million pigeonholes accounts for only 9 million people.

For the average case () with the constraint: fewest overlaps, there will be at most one person assigned to every pigeonhole and the 150,001st person assigned to the same pigeonhole as someone else. In the absence of this constraint, there may be empty pigeonholes because the &quot;collision&quot; happens before the 150,001st person. The principle just proves the existence of an overlap; it says nothing about the number of overlaps (which falls under the subject of probability distribution).

There is a passing, satirical, allusion in English to this version of the principle in &quot;A History of the Athenian Society&quot;, prefixed to &quot;A Supplement to the Athenian Oracle: Being a Collection of the Remaining Questions and Answers in the Old Athenian Mercuries&quot; (printed for Andrew Bell, London, 1710). It seems that the question &quot;whether there were any two persons in the World that have an equal number of hairs on their head?&quot; had been raised in &quot;The Athenian Mercury&quot; before 1704.

Perhaps the first written reference to the pigeonhole principle appears in a short sentence from the French Jesuit Jean Leurechon&#x27;s 1622 work &quot;Selectæ Propositiones&quot;: &quot;It is necessary that two men have the same number of hairs, écus, or other things, as each other.&quot; The full principle was spelled out two years later, with additional examples, in another book that has often been attributed to Leurechon, but might be by one of his students.

=== The birthday problem ===
The birthday problem asks, for a set of randomly chosen people, what is the probability that some pair of them will have the same birthday? The problem itself is mainly concerned with counterintuitive probabilities, but we can also tell by the pigeonhole principle that among 367 people, there is at least one pair of people who share the same birthday with 100% probability, as there are only 366 possible birthdays to choose from.

=== Team tournament ===
Imagine seven people who want to play in a tournament of teams items), with a limitation of only four teams holes) to choose from. The pigeonhole principle tells us that they cannot all play for different teams; there must be at least one team featuring at least two of the seven players: 
: formula_4

===Subset sum===
Any subset of size six from the set = {1,2,3...,9} must contain two elements whose sum is 10. The pigeonholes will be labeled by the two element subsets {1,9}, {2,8}, {3,7}, {4,6} and the singleton {5}, five pigeonholes in all. When the six &quot;pigeons&quot; (elements of the size six subset) are placed into these pigeonholes, each pigeon going into the pigeonhole that has it contained in its label, at least one of the pigeonholes labeled with a two-element subset will have two pigeons in it.

===Hashing===

Hashing in computer science is the process of mapping an arbitrarily large set of data to fixed-size values. This has applications in caching whereby large data sets can be stored by a reference to their representative values (their &quot;hash codes&quot;) in a &quot;hash table&quot; for fast recall. Typically, the number of unique objects in a data set is larger than the number of available unique hash codes , and the pigeonhole principle holds in this case that hashing those objects is no guarantee of uniqueness, since if you hashed all objects in the data set , some objects must necessarily share the same hash code.

== Uses and applications ==
The principle can be used to prove that any lossless compression algorithm, provided it makes some inputs smaller (as &quot;compression&quot; suggests), will also make some other inputs larger. Otherwise, the set of all input sequences up to a given length could be mapped to the (much) smaller set of all sequences of length less than without collisions (because the compression is lossless), a possibility that the pigeonhole principle excludes.

A notable problem in mathematical analysis is, for a fixed irrational number , to show that the set of fractional parts is dense in . One finds that it is not easy to explicitly find integers such that formula_5 where is a small positive number and is some arbitrary irrational number. But if one takes such that by the pigeonhole principle there must be formula_6 such that and are in the same integer subdivision of size (there are only such subdivisions between consecutive integers). In particular, one can find such that
:formula_7
for some integers and in }. One can then easily verify that 
:formula_8
This implies that where or . This shows that 0 is a limit point of {[]}. One can then use this fact to prove the case for in : find such that then if the proof is complete. Otherwise 
:formula_9
and by setting 
:formula_10 
one obtains 
:formula_11

Variants occur in a number of proofs. In the proof of the pumping lemma for regular languages, a version that mixes finite and infinite sets is used: If infinitely many objects are placed into finitely many boxes, then two objects share a box. In Fisk&#x27;s solution to the Art gallery problem a sort of converse is used: If objects are placed into boxes, then there is a box containing at most objects.

== Alternative formulations ==
The following are alternative formulations of the pigeonhole principle.

#If objects are distributed over places, and if , then some place receives at least two objects.
#(equivalent formulation of 1) If objects are distributed over places in such a way that no place receives more than one object, then each place receives exactly one object.
#(generalization of 1) If and are sets, and the cardinality of is greater than the cardinality of , then there is no injective function from to .
#If objects are distributed over places, and if , then some place receives no object.
#(equivalent formulation of 4) If objects are distributed over places in such a way that no place receives no object, then each place receives exactly one object.
#(generalization of 4) If and are sets, and the cardinality of is less than the cardinality of , then there is no surjective function from to .

==Strong form==
Let be positive integers. If
:formula_12
objects are distributed into boxes, then either the first box contains at least objects, or the second box contains at least objects, ..., or the th box contains at least objects.

The simple form is obtained from this by taking , which gives objects. Taking gives the more quantified version of the principle, namely:

Let and be positive integers. If objects are distributed into boxes, then at least one of the boxes contains or more of the objects.

This can also be stated as, if discrete objects are to be allocated to containers, then at least one container must hold at least formula_13 objects, where formula_14 is the ceiling function, denoting the smallest integer larger than or equal to . 
Similarly, at least one container must hold no more than formula_15 objects, where formula_16 is the floor function, denoting the largest integer smaller than or equal to .

== Generalizations of the pigeonhole principle ==

A probabilistic generalization of the pigeonhole principle states that if pigeons are randomly put into pigeonholes with uniform probability , then at least one pigeonhole will hold more than one pigeon with probability

:formula_17

where is the falling factorial . For and for (and ), that probability is zero; in other words, if there is just one pigeon, there cannot be a conflict. For (more pigeons than pigeonholes) it is one, in which case it coincides with the ordinary pigeonhole principle. But even if the number of pigeons does not exceed the number of pigeonholes (), due to the random nature of the assignment of pigeons to pigeonholes there is often a substantial chance that clashes will occur. For example, if 2 pigeons are randomly assigned to 4 pigeonholes, there is a 25% chance that at least one pigeonhole will hold more than one pigeon; for 5 pigeons and 10 holes, that probability is 69.76%; and for 10 pigeons and 20 holes it is about 93.45%. If the number of holes stays fixed, there is always a greater probability of a pair when you add more pigeons. This problem is treated at much greater length in the birthday paradox.

A further probabilistic generalization is that when a real-valued random variable has a finite mean , then the probability is nonzero that is greater than or equal to , and similarly the probability is nonzero that is less than or equal to . To see that this implies the standard pigeonhole principle, take any fixed arrangement of pigeons into holes and let be the number of pigeons in a hole chosen uniformly at random. The mean of is , so if there are more pigeons than holes the mean is greater than one. Therefore, is sometimes at least 2.

== Infinite sets ==

The pigeonhole principle can be extended to infinite sets by phrasing it in terms of cardinal numbers: if the cardinality of set is greater than the cardinality of set , then there is no injection from to . However, in this form the principle is tautological, since the meaning of the statement that the cardinality of set is greater than the cardinality of set is exactly that there is no injective map from to . However, adding at least one element to a finite set is sufficient to ensure that the cardinality increases.

Another way to phrase the pigeonhole principle for finite sets is similar to the principle that finite sets are Dedekind finite: Let and be finite sets. If there is a surjection from to that is not injective, then no surjection from to is injective. In fact no function of any kind from to is injective. This is not true for infinite sets: Consider the function on the natural numbers that sends 1 and 2 to 1, 3 and 4 to 2, 5 and 6 to 3, and so on.

There is a similar principle for infinite sets: If uncountably many pigeons are stuffed into countably many pigeonholes, there will exist at least one pigeonhole having uncountably many pigeons stuffed into it.

This principle is not a generalization of the pigeonhole principle for finite sets however: It is in general false for finite sets. In technical terms it says that if and are finite sets such that any surjective function from to is not injective, then there exists an element of such that there exists a bijection between the preimage of and . This is a quite different statement, and is absurd for large finite cardinalities.

==Quantum mechanics==
Yakir Aharonov et al. presented arguments that quantum mechanics may violate the pigeonhole principle, and proposed interferometric experiments to test the pigeonhole principle in quantum mechanics. 

Later research has called this conclusion into question. In a January 2015 arXiv preprint, researchers Alastair Rae and Ted Forgan at the University of Birmingham performed a theoretical wave function analysis, employing the standard pigeonhole principle, on the flight of electrons at various energies through an interferometer. If the electrons had no interaction strength at all, they would each produce a single, perfectly circular peak. At high interaction strength, each electron produces four distinct peaks, for a total of 12 peaks on the detector; these peaks are the result of the four possible interactions each electron could experience (alone, together with the first other particle only, together with the second other particle only, or all three together). If the interaction strength was fairly low, as would be the case in many real experiments, the deviation from a zero-interaction pattern would be nearly indiscernible, much smaller than the lattice spacing of atoms in solids, such as the detectors used for observing these patterns. This would make it very difficult or impossible to distinguish a weak-but-nonzero interaction strength from no interaction whatsoever, and thus give an illusion of three electrons that did not interact despite all three passing through two paths.

<text>Edgar Ætheling or Edgar II ( – 1125 or after) was the last male member of the royal house of Cerdic of Wessex. He was elected King of England by the Witan in 1066 but never crowned.

== Family and early life ==

Edgar was probably born in Hungary, where his father Edward the Exile, son of King Edmund Ironside, had found refuge after Edmund&#x27;s death and the conquest of England by the Danish king Cnut in 1016. Edgar&#x27;s mother was Agatha, who was described as a relative of the Holy Roman Emperor or a descendant of Saint Stephen of Hungary, but her exact identity is unknown. He was his parents&#x27; only son but had two sisters, Margaret and Cristina.

In 1057, Edward the Exile arrived in England with his family but died almost immediately. Edgar, a child, was left as the only surviving male member of the royal dynasty apart from the king, his great-uncle Edward the Confessor. Edgar was brought up by the Confessor&#x27;s wife, Edith, and he is recorded in the New Minster Liber Vitae as &quot;clito&quot;, the Latin for &quot;ætheling&quot;, a royal prince eligible for the throne. In the view of the historian Tom Licence, Edward chose Edgar as his heir, but this is questioned by other historians, who argue that Edward does not appear to have taken any steps to support his candidacy.

== Succession struggle ==
When King Edward the Confessor died in January 1066, Edgar was still in his early teens, considered too young to be an effective military leader. This had not been an insurmountable obstacle in the succession of previous kings. However, the avaricious ambitions that had been aroused across north-western Europe by the Confessor&#x27;s lack of an heir prior to 1057, and by the king&#x27;s failure thereafter to prepare the way for Edgar to succeed him, removed any prospect of a peaceful hereditary succession. War was clearly inevitable and Edgar was in no position to fight it, as he was without powerful adult relatives that could champion his cause. Accordingly, the Witenagemot elected Harold Godwinson to succeed Edward, as he was the man best placed to defend the country against foreign claimants to the throne.

Following Harold&#x27;s death at the Battle of Hastings against the invading Normans in October 1066, some of the Anglo-Saxon leaders decided to back young Edgar&#x27;s claim to the throne. The new regime thus established was dominated by the most powerful surviving members of the English ruling class: Stigand, Archbishop of Canterbury, Ealdred, Archbishop of York, and the brothers Edwin, Earl of Mercia and Morcar, Earl of Northumbria. The commitment of these men to Edgar&#x27;s cause, men who had so recently passed over his claim to the throne without apparent demur, must have been doubtful from the start. The strength of their resolve to continue the struggle against William of Normandy was questionable, and the military response they organised to the continuing Norman advance was ineffectual. When William crossed the Thames at Wallingford, he was met by Stigand, who now abandoned Edgar and submitted to the invader. As the Normans closed in on London, Edgar&#x27;s key supporters in the city began negotiating with William. In early December, the remaining members of the Witan in London met and resolved to take the young uncrowned king out to meet William to submit to him at Berkhamsted, quietly setting aside Edgar&#x27;s election. Edgar, alongside other lords, paid homage to King William at his coronation in December.

== Exile and war against the Normans ==
William kept Edgar in his custody and took him, along with other English leaders, to his court in Normandy in 1067, before returning with them to England. Edgar might have been involved in the abortive rebellion of the Earls Edwin and Morcar in 1068, or he might have been attempting to return to Hungary with his family and been blown off course; in any case, in that year he arrived with his mother and sisters at the court of King Malcolm III of Scotland. Malcolm married Edgar&#x27;s sister Margaret, and agreed to support Edgar in his attempt to reclaim the English throne. When the rebellion that resulted in the Harrying of the North broke out in Northumbria at the beginning of 1069, Edgar returned to England with other rebels who had fled to Scotland, to become the leader, or at least the figurehead, of the revolt. However, after early successes the rebels were defeated by William at York, and Edgar again sought refuge with Malcolm who happily allowed him asylum for his loyalty. In late summer that year, the arrival of a fleet sent by King Sweyn of Denmark triggered a fresh wave of English uprisings in various parts of the country. Edgar and the other exiles sailed to the Humber, where they linked up with Northumbrian rebels and the Danes. Their combined forces overwhelmed the Normans at York and took control of Northumbria, but a small seaborne raid which Edgar led into the former Kingdom of Lindsey ended in disaster, and he escaped with only a handful of followers to rejoin the main army. Late in the year, William fought his way into Northumbria and occupied York, buying off the Danes and devastating the surrounding country. Early in 1070, he moved against Edgar and other English leaders who had taken refuge with their remaining followers in a marshy region, perhaps Holderness or the Isle of Ely, and put them to flight. Edgar returned to Scotland.

He remained there until 1072, when William invaded Scotland and forced King Malcolm to submit to his overlordship. The terms of the agreement between them included the expulsion of Edgar. He therefore took up residence in Flanders, whose count, Robert the Frisian, was hostile to the Normans. However, he was able to return to Scotland in 1074. Shortly after his arrival there, he received an offer from Philip I, King of France, who was also at odds with William, of a castle and lands near the borders of Normandy from where he would be able to raid his enemies&#x27; homeland. He embarked with his followers for France, but a storm wrecked their ships on the English coast. Many of Edgar&#x27;s men were hunted down by the Normans, though he managed to escape with the remainder to Scotland by land. Following this disaster, he was persuaded by Malcolm to make peace with William and return to England as his subject, abandoning any ambition of regaining his ancestral throne.

== Italian venture ==
Disappointed at the level of recompense and respect he received from William, in 1086 Edgar renounced his allegiance to the Conqueror and moved with a retinue of men to Norman Apulia. The Domesday Book, compiled that year, records Edgar&#x27;s ownership of only two small estates (Barkway and Hermead) in Hertfordshire. This is probably because Edgar had given up his English properties when he left for Italy, not intending to return. In that case, the recording of the Hertfordshire estates under his name is likely to be an anomaly, reflecting a situation which had recently ceased to apply. The venture in the Mediterranean was evidently not a success; within a few years Edgar returned to England.

== Norman and Scottish dynastic strife ==
After King William&#x27;s death in 1087, Edgar supported William&#x27;s eldest son Robert Curthose, who succeeded him as Duke of Normandy, against his second son, William Rufus, who received the throne of England as William II. Edgar was one of Robert&#x27;s three principal advisers at this time. The war waged by Robert and his allies to overthrow William ended in defeat in 1091. As part of the resulting settlement between the brothers, Edgar was deprived of lands which he had been granted by Robert. These were presumably former possessions of William and his supporters in Normandy, confiscated by Robert and distributed to his own followers, including Edgar, but restored to their previous owners by the terms of the peace agreement. The disgruntled Edgar travelled once again to Scotland, where Malcolm was preparing for war with William. When William marched north and the two armies confronted one another, the kings opted to talk rather than fight. The negotiations were conducted by Edgar on behalf of Malcolm, and the newly reconciled Robert Curthose on behalf of William. The resulting agreement included a reconciliation between William and Edgar. However, within months Robert left England, unhappy with William&#x27;s failure to fulfil the pact between them, and Edgar went with him to Normandy.

Having returned to England, Edgar went to Scotland again in 1093, on a diplomatic mission for William to negotiate with Malcolm, who was dissatisfied with the Norman failure to implement in full the terms of the 1091 treaty. This dispute led to war, and within the year Malcolm had invaded England and had been killed along with his designated heir Edward, eldest of his sons by Margaret, in the Battle of Alnwick. Malcolm&#x27;s successor, his brother Donald Bán, drove out the English and French retainers who had risen high in Malcolm&#x27;s service and had thus aroused the jealousy of the existing Scottish aristocracy. This purge brought him into conflict with the Anglo-Norman monarchy, whose influence in Scotland had diminished. William helped Malcolm&#x27;s eldest son Duncan, who had spent many years as a hostage at William I&#x27;s court and remained there when set at liberty by William II, to overthrow his uncle, but Donald soon regained the throne and Duncan was killed. Another effort to restore the Anglo-Norman interest through sponsorship of Malcolm&#x27;s sons was launched in 1097, and Edgar made yet another journey to Scotland, this time in command of an invading army. Donald was ousted, and Edgar installed his nephew and namesake, Malcolm and Margaret&#x27;s son Edgar, on the Scottish throne.

== First Crusade ==
According to Orderic, Edgar was the commander of an English fleet which operated off the coast of the region of Syria in support of the First Crusade, whose crews eventually burned their dilapidated ships and joined the advance by land to Jerusalem. This is doubtful, for this fleet is known to have arrived off the Syrian coast by March 1098; since Edgar invaded Scotland late in 1097, he could not have made the voyage in the time available. It may be though that he travelled overland to the Mediterranean and joined the fleet en route; this is the view taken by Runciman. William of Malmesbury recorded that Edgar made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem in 1102, and it may be that Orderic&#x27;s report is the product of confusion, conflating the expedition of the English fleet with Edgar&#x27;s later journey. Some modern historians have suggested that at some point during these years Edgar served in the Varangian Guard of the Byzantine Empire, a unit which was at that time composed primarily of English emigrants, but this is unsupported by evidence. William of Malmesbury stated that on his way back from Jerusalem, Edgar was given rich gifts by both the Byzantine and the German emperors, each of whom offered him an honoured place at court, but that he insisted on returning home instead.

== Later life ==
Back in Europe, Edgar again took the side of Robert Curthose in the internal struggles of the Norman dynasty, this time against Robert&#x27;s youngest brother, who was now Henry I, King of England. He was taken prisoner in the final defeat at the Battle of Tinchebray in 1106, which resulted in Robert being imprisoned for the rest of his life. Edgar was more fortunate: having been taken back to England, he was pardoned and released by King Henry. His niece Edith (renamed Matilda), daughter of Malcolm III and Margaret, had married Henry in 1100. Edgar is believed to have travelled to Scotland once more late in life, perhaps around the year 1120. He lived to see the death at sea in November 1120 of William Adelin, the son of his niece Edith and heir to Henry I. Edgar was still alive in 1125, according to William of Malmesbury, who wrote at the time that Edgar &quot;now grows old in the country in privacy and quiet&quot;. Edgar died some time after this contemporary reference, but the exact date and the location of his grave are not known.

According to a 1291 Huntingdon Priory Chronicle, Edgar had one child, Margaret Lovel, who was the wife of firstly Ralph Lovel II, of Castle Cary and secondly of Robert de Londres, both of whom had estates in southern Scotland.

There are two references to an &quot;Edgar Adeling&quot; found in the &quot;Magnus Rotulus Pipae Northumberland&quot; (Pipe rolls) for the years 1158 and 1167. Historian Edward Freeman, writing in &quot;The History of the Norman Conquest of England&quot;, says that this was the same Edgar (aged over 100), a son of his, or some other person known by the title &quot;Ætheling&quot;.
