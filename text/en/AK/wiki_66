<text>Silver City Airways was an airline based in the United Kingdom that operated mainly in Europe between 1946 and 1962. Unlike many airlines at the time, it was independent of government-owned corporations; its parent company was Zinc Corporation, an Australian company involved mainly in mining and mineral processing. The name &quot;Silver City&quot; originated as a nickname of Broken Hill, Australia – an area famed for silver mines, including some owned by the airline&#x27;s parent company.

The first commercial flight by Silver City departed London Heathrow for Sydney via Johannesburg in late 1946. The following year, Silver City leased its first Bristol Freighter, moved its base to Blackbushe and participated in the airlift of Hindu and Muslim refugees between Pakistan and India. In 1948, control of Silver City passed from the Zinc Corporation to British Aviation Services. In July of that year, the airline inaugurated the world&#x27;s first air ferry service across the English Channel between Lympne Airport and Le Touquet Airport. In 1948–49, Silver City participated in the Berlin Airlift. In 1949, it established a French sister airline.

In 1953, Silver City took delivery of its first Bristol Superfreighter. The following year, the company moved to a new permanent home at Lydd Ferryfield, Britain&#x27;s first newly constructed post-war airport. The same year, Silver City Airways came under the control of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company (P&amp;O). By the mid-1950s, Silver City had become the biggest air cargo carrier in the United Kingdom while annual passenger numbers at its &quot;Ferryfield&quot; base had reached ¼ of a million. During that time, the airline also inaugurated air ferry services between Scotland and Ireland and from/to the Midlands. This period also saw the launch of &quot;Silver Arrow&quot;, a London—Paris coach-air-coach/rail service, with the cross-Channel air portion operating between Lydd and Le Touquet. In 1957, Silver City accomplished its one-millionth Channel crossing. In summer 1958, Silver City&#x27;s &quot;Ferryfield&quot; base recorded more aircraft movements than any other UK airport. That year, also marked the conclusion of Silver City&#x27;s first decade of air ferry operations during which the airline operated more than 100,000 flights carrying over 200,000 vehicles and ¾ of a million passengers, with peak-day frequency exceeding 200. In 1959, Silver City took over sister airline Britavia&#x27;s Handley Page Hermes fleet and Manston base. That year, the airline also began oil industry support flights in Libya.

By 1960, Silver City&#x27;s 40,000 annual cross-Channel flights transported 220,000 passengers and 90,000 vehicles while network-wide freight haulage reached 135,000 tons a year. The following summer, the airline reached agreement with a French rival to co-finance construction of a branch line linking Le Touquet Airport with the nearby main railway line to reduce surface travelling time from/to Paris. Unsustainable losses as a result of the loss of the Libyan oil industry support flight contract, increasing competition from roll-on/roll-off ferries and the lack of suitable replacements for the ageing Bristol Freighters resulted in growing financial difficulties, culminating in Silver City&#x27;s takeover by British United Airways (BUA) holding company Air Holdings in 1962.

==History==

===The 1940s===
In 1946, Air Cdre Griffith James (&quot;Taffy&quot;) Powell got in touch with W.S. Robinson, chairman of London-based mining company the Zinc Corporation. That meeting resulted in Robinson appointing Powell as the Zinc Corporation&#x27;s adviser.

One of Powell&#x27;s first visits in his new capacity took him to Broken Hill, Australia, also known as &quot;Silver City&quot;. This visit resulted in the decision to set up a new air transport operator to serve the mining industry, to be named &quot;Silver City&quot;.

Silver City Airways was incorporated on 25 November 1946. British Aviation Services (BAS), an early post-World War II airline holding company and air transport operator, became one of Silver City&#x27;s shareholders, initially taking a 10% stake. Air Cdre Griffith James Powell was the first managing director of both BAS and Silver City.

Silver City&#x27;s first base was at Langley Aerodrome.

The airline&#x27;s initial fleet comprised four ex-military Douglas Dakotas and three Avro Lancastrians, the 13-seater civil version of the Lancaster Mark 3 bomber. Two of the latter were new aircraft that had been ordered by British South American Airways (BSAA).

Lancastrian G-AHBW operated the company&#x27;s first commercial flight, from London Airport (Heathrow) to Sydney via Johannesburg in November 1946. This was followed by similar operations to Johannesburg via Karachi and to Malta before the end of the year.

In October 1947, Silver City became involved in the airlift of Hindu and Muslim refugees between Pakistan and India, following the Subcontinent&#x27;s partitioning. This operation constituted the fledgling airline&#x27;s first major engagement. Initially, the repatriation airlift was undertaken by four Dakotas. On short journeys, the authorities granted Silver City dispensation to raise the limit on the maximum number of passengers it could carry from 28 to 52 to airlift as many people as quickly as possible.

Also that year, Silver City moved its base to Blackbushe Airport, as a result of Langley&#x27;s closure due to Heathrow&#x27;s expansion.

Also in 1947, Silver City leased its first Bristol Freighter from the manufacturer to replace one of the four Dakotas that had originally been allocated to the repatriation airlift in the Indian subcontinent. Like the Dakotas it had operated on that airlift, Silver City was given dispensation to increase the maximum number of passengers it could carry on the Bristol Freighter above the normal limit of 32. Actual loads on this aircraft type often exceeded 100 passengers per flight, resulting in a total of 1,105 evacuees and their belongings being transported aboard Silver City&#x27;s single Freighter over a period of nine days. The airline&#x27;s Bristol Freighter fleet soon expanded to four aircraft. The Freighter would play a major role in the company&#x27;s development over the coming years. Powell realised that the Bristol Freighter could be adapted to fly car owners with their vehicles from Britain to Continental Europe and the Channel Islands. This &quot;air ferry&quot; would allow British holidaymakers avoid long waits for sea ferries and time-consuming, bumpy rides in rough waters.

On 7 July 1948, a Silver City Bristol Freighter operated the first cross-Channel air ferry service, between Lympne near Folkestone in Kent and Le Touquet on France&#x27;s northern Côte d&#x27;Opale coast, with good road connections from and to London and Paris respectively. The new service, which initially operated on a seasonal charter basis, became a year-round scheduled operation in 1949. In the beginning, there was a flat £32 one-way fare to take a group of four passengers along with their car across the Channel. Once opposition from British European Airways (BEA) to the carriage of passengers travelling without vehicles was overcome, a new fare structure was introduced. For example, a group of four travelling with a small car was charged only £27, while the comparable fare for four people travelling with a large car remained at £32. By the end of 1949, this operation fully utilised five Freighters, which carried 2,700 cars and 10,000 passengers. These figures represented a significant increase over the previous year when only 178 cars and their occupants, as well as some motorcycles and bicycles had been carried until the end of the season in September.

The same year, the Zinc Corporation sold its shareholding in Silver City to BAS, making the latter the airline&#x27;s sole owner. Silver City subsequently became BAS&#x27;s biggest operating division.

Silver City joined the 1948–49 Berlin Airlift with a single Bristol Freighter in September 1948. Owing to heavy demand for additional civilian airlift capacity, the airline leased a further two Freighters from the Bristol Aeroplane Company. By the time the civil contribution to the Airlift was scaled down in February 1949, the company&#x27;s three Bristol Freighters were the last twin-engined airliners employed in this operation. When it came to an end, the firm&#x27;s Freighters had flown a total of about 800 hours.

In February 1949, Silver City established a French sister airline headquartered in Paris to operate vehicle ferry flights from Le Touquet Airport. The new company was registered under the name &quot;Société Commerciale Aérienne du Littoral&quot; (SCAL). A number of Silver City aircraft were registered to this company. These were transferred onto the French aircraft register. In addition, an agreement was reached to appoint the &quot;Automobile Club de France&quot; as Silver City&#x27;s and SCAL&#x27;s official representative in France. These steps were necessary to secure French approval to turn the seasonal charter flights Silver City had operated on this route into a full-fledged scheduled operation.

===The 1950s===
By 1950, the number of cars and passengers carried on Silver City&#x27;s cross-Channel services roughly doubled to 5,000 and 24,000 respectively.

To encourage further traffic growth on its Lympne — Le Touquet cross-Channel car ferry service, Silver City reduced fares with effect from 19 September 1950: the rate for cars up to 14 feet in length was cut from £27 to £19 while the rate for larger vehicles dropped from £32 to £25. This reduction left Silver City&#x27;s fares only slightly higher than the Dover—Calais ferry fares of British Railways&#x27; Southern Region and, together with the service&#x27;s earlier extension permitting the carriage of cycles and motor cycles, helped establish the airline&#x27;s ferry services as a serious competitor to the railways.

The success of Silver City&#x27;s Lympne — Le Touquet air ferry service resulted in subsequent introduction of additional routes across the English Channel and to other parts of the United Kingdom.

Over the coming years, Silver City pursued a policy of continuous fare reductions to fill the additional capacity on its growing air ferry network. This included new car ferry services between Southampton (Eastleigh) and Cherbourg as well as between Southend (Rochford) and Ostend and a DC-3 passenger service linking Gatwick and Le Touquet. Both of the former commenced in spring 1952, while the latter was inaugurated the following year. As a result, the number of vehicles carried doubled from 5,000 to 10,000 between 1950 and 1952 and quadrupled to 40,000 by the end of the following year. The latter was the consequence of an average 40% fare reduction.

BAS&#x27;s takeover of Air Kruise, an independent charter and pleasure flight operator based at Lympne, in March 1953 brought a fleet of all-passenger de Havilland Dragon Rapides and Douglas Dakotas. This acquisition resulted in formation of Silver City&#x27;s &quot;Passenger Division&quot;.
In summer 1953, Silver City leased a Breguet Br.763 to participate in the second &quot;Little Berlin Airlift&quot; on the Hamburg (Fuhlsbüttel) — Berlin (Tempelhof) route. A total of 127 round trips carried of freight with up to three round trips being made in a day, each leg taking 52 minutes&#x27; flight time.

In 1953, Silver City also took delivery of its first stretched Mark 32 Bristol Superfreighter, the first of six. The Superfreighter&#x27;s elongated nose enabled it to accommodate three cars or to be fitted with 60 seats in an all-passenger Super Wayfarer configuration. The new Superfreighters joined a fleet of nine standard Mark 21 Freighters. Other freight charter work at this time included flights to the Suez Canal Zone supporting the UK military forces then stationed there.

As operations expanded, the small grass airfield at Lympne became increasingly inadequate. The search for a suitable location to site a new, purpose-built airport began in 1953. Interim moves to Southend and West Malling were followed by final selection of an area covered by grazing land on the edge of the Dungeness shingle desert on the Kentish coast close to the village of Lydd. This site would host Britain&#x27;s first newly constructed post-war and first privately owned airport. It would feature two runways, a control tower, passenger terminal with a restaurant, maintenance area and petrol station. The new airport — named &quot;Ferryfield&quot; — opened on 14 July 1954, after six months&#x27; work costing £400,000. However, it took almost another two years for the official opening ceremony to be performed at &quot;Ferryfield&quot;, which occurred on 5 April 1956. On that day, the Duke of Edinburgh arrived at &quot;Ferryfield&quot; just before 11.00 am on board the Royal Heron. The occasion marked the Duke&#x27;s first visit to a private British airline at an all-new, privately owned airport. Following his tour of the airport&#x27;s facilities, the Duke boarded one of Silver City&#x27;s scheduled air ferry services to Le Touquet on Superfreighter G-AMWD. During the 19-minute flight, the Duke flew the aircraft at its scheduled en route height of 1,000 ft. The Duke&#x27;s reception at Le Touquet Airport was followed by an informal lunch hosted in his honour by the president of the French Aero Clubs in the airport restaurant. The Duke then departed, flying the Royal Heron to London Airport.

By 1954, the Silver City cross-Channel network comprised five routes: Gatwick — Le Touquet, Lydd — Le Touquet, Lympne—Calais, Lympne—Ostend and Southampton—Cherbourg.

Following the opening of &quot;Ferryfield&quot; in mid-1954, Silver City initially split its operations between the new airport and Lympne. For a short while, Le Touquet flights operated from the former while Calais and Ostend services continued to use the latter. The last of 33,000 Silver City flights, which had carried a total of 54,000 cars and 208,000 passengers since 1948, departed Lympne on 3 October. From then on, vehicle ferry services were concentrated at &quot;Ferryfield&quot;.

Also in 1954, control of Silver City passed to P&amp;O via General Steam Navigation, which had acquired a 70% stake in BAS, the airline&#x27;s parent company. It was also the year Silver City complemented its Gatwick — Le Touquet all-passenger operation with a vehicle ferry service.

By 1955, &quot;Ferryfield&quot; handled 250,000 passengers annually. This made it busier than Gatwick.

Also in 1955, Silver City launched its first air ferry services between Scotland and Ireland and its first such service from the Midlands. These linked Stranraer with Belfast and Birmingham with Le Touquet. In addition, the airline opened a new service from Southampton to Deauville.

That year also saw Silver City become the UK&#x27;s biggest air cargo carrier with an annual freight volume of 70,190 tons.

In 1956, Silver City commenced London—Paris coach-air-coach/rail services via Lydd (&quot;Ferryfield&quot;) and Le Touquet/Étaples. As Le Touquet Airport was not linked to the French railway network at the time, the journey between the airport and Paris involved an additional change between coach and train at Étaples. DC-3s initially operated these all-passenger services, which were marketed as &quot;Silver Arrow&quot; in the UK and as &quot;Flèche d&#x27;argent&quot; in France. &quot;Silver Arrow&quot;/&quot;Flèche d&#x27;argent&quot; was a joint operation between British Railways, Silver City and Société Nationale des Chemins de Fer français (SNCF).

By 1957, BAS&#x27;s airline subsidiaries included Air Kruise, Aquila Airways, Britavia, the Lancashire Aircraft Corporation and the original Manx Airlines, apart from Silver City Airways itself.

Also in 1957, Silver City completed its one-millionth Channel crossing since its inaugural Lympne — Le Touquet air ferry service took to the air in July 1948.

That year also saw Silver City become involved in supporting the oil industry in Libya, flying geologists and supplying desert camps with a fleet of DC-3s and a single DC-2 from bases at Tripoli and Benghazi. The airline&#x27;s sole DC-2 was originally operated by Swissair and subsequently sold to new owners in South Africa, who leased it to Silver City.

By 1958, &quot;Ferryfield&quot; had become one of Britain&#x27;s three busiest airports. It recorded more aircraft movements during the peak summer months than any other airport in the UK, and only Heathrow and Northolt were busier in terms of annual air freight volume.

That year also marked the conclusion of the first decade of Silver City&#x27;s air ferry services. During that period, the airline completed 125,000 ferry flights. These carried 215,000 vehicles and 750,000 passengers. At its peak, Silver City operated 222 daily ferry flights across the English Channel, as well as between Scotland and Ireland and to/from the Isle of Wight, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. Cross-Channel flights to France operated between 7.30 am and 11.00 pm. The average fare was £25 per car and £4 per passenger. This was furthermore the time the Air Kruise cross-Channel services, as well as all Dragon Airways, Lancashire Aircraft Corporation and Manx Airlines operations from Newcastle upon Tyne, Blackpool and the Isle of Man were transferred to Silver City&#x27;s new Northern Division to streamline BAS&#x27;s fragmented airline operations. It was hoped that these measures would improve BAS&#x27;s financial performance.

In May of the same year, the crew of a Silver City Dakota made the first sighting of the &quot;Lady Be Good&quot;, a WW II bomber that had disappeared in 1943 while returning from an operation to Naples, in the Libyan Desert.

In 1959, Britavia transferred its five-strong Hermes 4A fleet to sister airline Silver City, as a consequence of the loss of a trooping contract to Eagle. The Hermes were based at Manston, from where they operated &quot;Silver Arrow&quot; all-passenger services to Le Touquet and inclusive tour charters to European destinations until parent company BAS&#x27;s acquisition by British United Airways (BUA) parent Air Holdings in 1962.

Also in 1959, Silver City opened a Blackpool-Dublin route.

By the end of that decade, Silver City advertised £8 18s day-return fares for its London—Paris &quot;Silver Arrow&quot;/&quot;Flèche d&#x27;argent&quot; service.

===The 1960s===

By 1960, Silver City made 40,000 yearly Channel crossings, carrying 90,000 vehicles and 220,000 passengers. During that year, it also moved 135,000 tons of freight across its network. This represented an increase of 35% over the previous year.

In summer 1961, Silver City agreed with rival French air ferry operator Compagnie Air Transport (CAT) for the latter to finance the construction of a two-mile rail spur into Le Touquet Airport from the nearby main line to reduce the travelling time between the airport and Paris by cutting out the coach/rail change at Étaples. In return, Silver City transferred three of its Superfreighters to CAT along with the traffic rights to operate the &quot;Ferryfield&quot; — Le Touquet and Bournemouth (Hurn) — Cherbourg routes. This arrangement gave CAT a 25% share of the car ferry market between Britain and France.

Having been outbid by Belgium&#x27;s flag carrier Sabena for the Libyan oil industry support flight contract that year, Silver City&#x27;s losses became unsustainable. This necessitated the sale of three Superfreighters to CAT for £192,300.

Following growing financial difficulties, Silver City was taken over by BUA parent Air Holdings in 1962. The takeover was officially announced in January of that year. Air Holdings were the owners of Channel Air Bridge, a rival air ferry operator based at Southend in Essex, which operated similar services from Southend to the Continent. The BUA-BAS merger removed BUA&#x27;s last remaining independent competitor in the air ferry business. The addition of Silver City&#x27;s 650,000 annual ferry passengers increased the yearly combined total to just under one million, accounting for two thirds of BUA&#x27;s total passengers. However, the change in ownership failed to staunch the airline&#x27;s losses. These amounted to £650,000 during the first half of 1962. By the end of the year, the Silver City name ceased to be used as all aircraft had either been repainted in BUA colours or retired.

Despite the poor financial performance, 1962 turned out to be the busiest year in Silver City&#x27;s 16-year history. During that year, the airline and its French partner CAT carried 96,272 vehicles and 238,748 passengers on 43,064 flights, representing increases of 10%, 6% and 12% compared with 1961. In addition, over 43,000 tonnes of cargo were carried. However, these record-breaking traffic statistics did not alter the fact that the airline&#x27;s air ferry operation was no longer economically viable. With the advent of new, high-capacity roll-on/roll-off ferries competition intensified. Established aircraft manufacturers were not interested in producing reasonably priced replacements for the ageing Bristol Freighters/Superfreighters that were suffering from wing fatigue. The airline&#x27;s long-standing policy of stimulating the market by continuously reducing fares had resulted in uneconomic yields in the absence of a corresponding reduction in costs. The Hermes fleet had continued in operation serving several UK airports, mainly on inclusive tour flights, with the last example being retired from service in late 1962.

On 1 January 1963, Air Holdings merged Silver City with Channel Air Bridge to form British United Air Ferries.

==Accidents and incidents==
There are three recorded accidents involving Silver City aircraft, two of which were fatal.

The worst accident in company history occurred on 27 February 1958. Bristol 170 Mark 21E Freighter registration G-AICS operating a charter flight from the Isle of Man to Manchester on behalf of Manx Airlines crashed in bad weather on Winter Hill near Bolton, Lancashire, destroying the aircraft and killing 35 of 39 passengers (all three crew members survived).

The aircraft was chartered by the Isle of Man motor trade to take members to the Exide battery factory in Clifton Junction, and it hit the northeast slope of Winter Hill in thick fog at a height of approximately and burst into flames, as a result of a navigational error committed by the first officer.

The second fatal accident occurred on 1 November 1961. Bristol 170 Mark 32 Superfreighter registration G-ANWL operating a scheduled service from Cherbourg to Guernsey crashed after losing height during a missed approach to Guernsey Airport, damaging the aircraft beyond repair and killing two out of three crew members (all seven passengers survived).

Having failed to gain height following a power increase to go around, the aircraft struck the ground with its starboard wing and cartwheeled due to a malfunctioning automatic pitch coarsening unit of the starboard propeller.

The non-fatal accident occurred on 19 January 1953. Bristol 170 Mark 21 Freighter registration G-AICM operating a non-scheduled cargo flight from West Berlin crash-landed near Tempelhof Airport as a result of fuel starvation when bad weather at the destination forced it to return to Berlin. Although the accident damaged the aircraft beyond repair, both pilots survived.

==Resurrection==
Air Holdings, which had retained the rights to the &quot;Silver City&quot; name following the merger between Silver City and Channel Air Bridge to form British United Air Ferries a decade earlier, resurrected Silver City for a short period during 1973.

The airline&#x27;s second incarnation was as a specialist livestock carrier transporting cattle between Norwich and Germany. This operation utilised three of five Vickers Vanguards owned by Air Holdings, which had been leased to Invicta International Airlines. That airline&#x27;s failure to pay for the leases had resulted in Air Holdings repossessing the aircraft and starting its own air freight operation.

Air Holdings&#x27; lack of success with its German cattle charters led to a decision to put the aircraft up for sale in October and to close down the airline the following month, with the &quot;Silver City&quot; name being de-activated by the end of the year.

==In fiction==
* The company is mentioned in Ian Fleming&#x27;s James Bond Novel &quot;Goldfinger&quot; – Goldfinger mentions to Bond that he takes his car to Europe – &#x27;I take a plane to myself. The Silver City company knows the car. It is a regular routine, twice a year.&#x27;
* The company features in a British Black &amp; white Comedy &quot;A Weekend with Lulu&quot; 
* A Silver City Bristol 170 Car Ferry Aircraft is also featured in the Opening Titles of the Rock Hudson Movie &quot;Come September&quot;

<text>Buckinghamshire (, abbreviated &quot;Bucks&quot;) is a ceremonial county in South East England and one of the home counties. It is bordered by Northamptonshire to the north, Bedfordshire to the north-east, Hertfordshire to the east, Greater London to the south-east, Berkshire to the south, and Oxfordshire to the west. The largest settlement is the city of Milton Keynes, and the county town is Aylesbury.

The county has an area of and had a population of 840,138 at the 2021 census. Besides Milton Keynes, which is in the north-east, the largest settlements are in the southern half of the county and include Aylesbury, High Wycombe, and Chesham. For local government purposes Buckinghamshire comprises two unitary authorities, Buckinghamshire Council and Milton Keynes City Council. The historic county had slightly different borders, and included the towns of Slough and Eton.

The Chiltern Hills, an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, occupy the south of the county and contain its highest point, Haddington Hill (). The Chilterns are the source of the River Ouzel, which flows across the lowland Vale of Aylesbury in the north of the county and through Milton Keynes before meeting the River Great Ouse at Newport Pagnell. The Thames forms part of the county&#x27;s southern boundary.

Notable service amenities in the county are Pinewood Film Studios, Dorney rowing lake and part of Silverstone race track on the Northamptonshire border. Many national companies have head offices or major centres in Milton Keynes. Heavy industry and quarrying is limited, with agriculture predominating after service industries.

==History==

The name Buckinghamshire is Anglo-Saxon in origin and means &quot;The district (scire) of Bucca&#x27;s home&quot;. &quot;Bucca&#x27;s home&quot; refers to Buckingham in the north of the county, and is named after the Anglo-Saxon landowner, &quot;Bucca&quot;. The county has been so named since about the 12th century; however, the county has existed since it was a subdivision of the kingdom of Mercia (585–919).

The history of the area predates the Anglo-Saxon period and the county has a rich history starting from the Brittonic and Roman periods, though the Anglo-Saxons perhaps had the greatest impact on Buckinghamshire: the geography of the rural county is largely as it was in the Anglo-Saxon period. Later, Buckinghamshire became an important political arena, with King Henry VIII intervening in local politics in the 16th century, and just a century later the English Civil War was reputedly started by John Hampden in mid-Bucks.

Historically, the biggest change to the county came in the 19th century, when a combination of cholera and famine hit the rural county, forcing many to migrate to larger towns to find work. Not only did this alter the local economic situation, it meant a lot of land was going cheap at a time when the rich were more mobile, and leafy Bucks became a popular rural idyll: an image it still has today. Buckinghamshire is a popular home for London commuters, leading to greater local affluence; however, some pockets of relative deprivation remain.

The expansion of London and coming of the railways promoted the growth of towns in the south of the county such as Aylesbury, Amersham and High Wycombe, leaving the town Buckingham itself to the north in a relative backwater. As a result, most county institutions are now based in the south of the county or Milton Keynes, rather than in Buckingham.

==Geography==
The county can be split into two sections geographically. The south leads from the River Thames up the gentle slopes of the Chiltern Hills to the more abrupt slopes on the northern side leading to the Vale of Aylesbury and the City of Milton Keynes UA, a large and relatively level expanse of land that is the southern catchment of the River Great Ouse.

===Waterways===
====Rivers====
The county includes parts of two of the four longest rivers in England. The Thames forms the southern boundary with Berkshire, which has crept over the border at Eton and Slough so that the river is no longer the sole boundary between the two counties. The Great Ouse rises just outside the county in Northamptonshire and flows east through Buckingham, Milton Keynes and Olney.

====Canals====

The main branch of the Grand Union Canal passes through the county as do its arms to Slough and Aylesbury, as well as the disused arms to Wendover and Buckingham. The canal has been incorporated into the landscaping of Milton Keynes.

===Landscape===
The southern part of the county is dominated by the Chiltern Hills. The two highest points in Buckinghamshire are Haddington Hill in Wendover Woods (a stone marks its summit) at above sea level and Coombe Hill near Wendover at .

====Mineral extraction====
Quarrying has taken place for chalk, clay for brickmaking and gravel and sand in the river valleys. Flint, also extracted from quarries, was often used to build older local buildings. Several former quarries, now flooded, have become nature reserves.

==Demography==

The administration of Buckinghamshire is further sub-divided into civil parishes.
Today Buckinghamshire is ethnically diverse, particularly in the larger towns. At the end of the 19th century some Welsh drover families settled in north Bucks and, in the last quarter of the 20th century, a large number of Londoners in Milton Keynes. Between 6 and 7% of the population of Aylesbury are of Asian or Asian British origin. Likewise Chesham has a similar-sized Asian community, and High Wycombe is the most ethnically diverse town in the county, with large Asian and Afro-Caribbean populations. During the Second World War there were many Polish settlements in Bucks, Czechs in Aston Abbotts and Wingrave, and Albanians in Frieth. Remnants of these communities remain in the county.

==Politics==


===Ceremonial===

The ceremonial county of Buckinghamshire consists of both unitary authority areas combined. The ceremonial county has a Lord Lieutenant and a High Sheriff. Since November 2020, the Lord Lieutenant of Buckinghamshire is The Countess Howe and the High Sheriff of Buckinghamshire is Dame Ann Geraldine Limb, DBE of Stony Stratford The office of &quot;Custos rotulorum&quot; has been combined with that of Lord Lieutenant since 1702.

The ceremonial county has two top-level administrations both are unitary authorities Buckinghamshire Council, which administers about four-fifths of the county and two-thirds of its population, and Milton Keynes City Council, which administers the remainder.

===Buckinghamshire County Council (1889–1997)===
Buckinghamshire County Council was founded in 1889 with its base in new municipal buildings in Walton Street, Aylesbury (which are still there).

In 1966, the council moved into new premises: a 15-storey tower block in the centre of Aylesbury (pictured) designed by county architect Fred Pooley. It is now a Grade II listed building.

From 1974 (following the Local Government Act 1972) local administration was run on a two-tier system where public services were split between the county council and five district councils (Aylesbury Vale, Chiltern, Milton Keynes, South Bucks and Wycombe).

===Buckinghamshire County Council (1997–2020)===
In 1997, the northernmost part of Buckinghamshire, until then Milton Keynes District, was separated to form a unitary authority, the Borough of Milton Keynes; for ceremonial purposes Milton Keynes remains part of Buckinghamshire. The administration of the remainder of the county continued to be called Buckinghamshire County Council.

Buckinghamshire County Council was a large employer in the county and provided a variety of services, including education (schools, adult education and youth services), social services, highways, libraries, County Archives and Record Office, the County Museum and the Roald Dahl Children&#x27;s Gallery in Aylesbury, consumer services and some aspects of waste disposal and planning.

===Buckinghamshire Council (2020 onwards)===
Buckinghamshire Council is a unitary authority covering most of the ceremonial county of Buckinghamshire. It was created in April 2020 from the areas that were previously administered by Buckinghamshire County Council and the district councils of South Bucks, Chiltern, Wycombe, and Aylesbury Vale.

===Milton Keynes City Council===

A local authority for North Buckinghamshire was formed by the Local Government Act 1972, styled as the &quot;Milton Keynes District Council&quot; and subordinate to Buckinghamshire County Council. Its (district) council was first elected in 1973, a year before formally coming into its powers and prior to the creation of the District of Milton Keynes on 1 April 1974. The council was granted borough status on its foundation, entitling it to be known as &quot;Milton Keynes Borough Council&quot; and to annually appoint a (ceremonial) Mayor of Milton Keynes. On 1 April 1997, the Borough became a self-governing unitary authority, independent of the County Council. Following award of Letters Patent in 2022, the Borough became the City of Milton Keynes, and its council became Milton Keynes City Council. The remit of the City Council extends beyond the Milton Keynes urban area, encompassing a significant rural area with villages, hamlets, and the market town of Olney.

===Flag===

The traditional flag of Buckinghamshire comprises a chained swan on a bicolour of red and black. The flag was registered with the Flag Institute on 20 May 2011.

===Coat of arms===

The coat of arms of the former Buckinghamshire County Council features a white mute swan in chains. This dates back to the Anglo-Saxon period, when swans were bred in Buckinghamshire for the king&#x27;s pleasure. That the swan is in chains illustrates that the swan is bound to the monarch, an ancient law that still applies to wild swans in the UK today. The arms were first borne at the Battle of Agincourt by the Duke of Buckingham.

Above the swan is a gold band, in the centre of which is Whiteleaf Cross, representing the many ancient landmarks of the county. The shield is surmounted by a beech tree, representing the Chiltern Forest that once covered almost half the county. Either side of the shield are a buck, for Buckingham, and a swan, the county symbol.

The motto of the shield is &quot;Vestigia Nulla Retrorsum&quot;. This is Latin and means &#x27;no stepping back&#x27; (or &#x27;no steps backwards&#x27;).

==Economy==
Buckinghamshire has a modern service-based economy and is part of the Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire NUTS-2 region, which was the seventh richest subregion in the European Union in 2002. As well as the highest GDP per capita outside Inner London, Buckinghamshire has the highest quality of life, the highest life expectancy and the best education results in the country. The southern part of the county is a prosperous section of the London commuter belt. The county has fertile agricultural lands, with many landed estates, especially those of the Rothschild banking family of England in the 19th century (see Rothschild properties in England). The county has several annual agricultural shows, with the Bucks County Show established in 1859. Manufacturing industries include furniture-making (traditionally centred at High Wycombe), pharmaceuticals and agricultural processing. Pinewood Studios in Iver Heath is a principal centre of operations for film and TV production in the UK.

==Places of interest==

Buckinghamshire is notable for its open countryside and natural features, including the Chiltern Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, Stowe Landscaped Gardens near Buckingham, and the River Thames. The Ridgeway Path, a long-distance footpath, passes through the county. The county also has many historic houses. Some of these are opened to the public by the National Trust, such as Waddesdon Manor, West Wycombe Park and Cliveden. Other historic houses are still in use as private homes, such as the Prime Minister&#x27;s country retreat Chequers.

Claydon House (near Steeple Claydon), Hughenden Manor (near High Wycombe), Stowe Landscaped Gardens, and Waddesdon Manor (near Aylesbury) are in the care of the National Trust.

Mentmore Towers, a 19th-century English country house built by the Rothschilds is located the village of Mentmore. It is the largest of the English Rothschild houses and is known for its Jacobean-styled architecture designed by Joseph Paxton.

Bletchley Park in Milton Keynes is the site of World War II British codebreaking and Colossus, the world&#x27;s first programmable electronic digital computer. Together with the co-located National Museum of Computing, it is a nationally important visitor attraction.

Examples of historical architecture in the Chiltern region are preserved at the Chiltern Open Air Museum, an open-air folk museum near Chalfont St Giles. The site contains reconstructed buildings which might otherwise have been destroyed or demolished as a result of redevelopment or road construction.

The market town of Olney, in the Milton Keynes UA, is home to Cowper and Newton Museum which celebrates the work and lives of two famous figures: William Cowper (1731–1800) a celebrated 18th-century poet; and John Newton, a prominent slave trade abolitionist who was curate in the local church. Together, Cowper and Newton wrote the &quot;Olney Hymns&quot;, including one of the world&#x27;s most popular hymns, Amazing Grace&quot;.

Buckinghamshire is the home of various notable people in connection with whom tourist attractions have been established: for example the author Roald Dahl who included many local features and characters in his works. Artists William Callow and Harriet Anne Smart Callow produced many paintings of the area in the late 19th century.

Sports facilities in Buckinghamshire include half of the international Silverstone Circuit which straddles the Buckinghamshire and Northamptonshire border, the Adams Park Stadium in the south and Stadium MK in the north, and Dorney Lake (named &#x27;Eton Dorney&#x27; for the event) was used as the rowing venue for the 2012 Summer Olympics.

==Media==
The county is covered by three overlapping TV regions
* BBC South and ITV Meridian, covering the western side of the county,
* BBC East and ITV Anglia, covering the north and east of the county, and
* BBC London &amp; ITV London, covering the south of the county.

Local radio stations are BBC Three Counties Radio, BBC Radio Berkshire (covering Marlow), Heart Thames Valley (now Heart South), Heart Four Counties (now Heart East), Greatest Hits Radio Bucks, Beds and Herts (formerly Mix 96) and Wycombe Sound (covering High Wycombe).

==Transport==
===Roads===
Buckinghamshire is served by four motorways, although two are on its borders:
* M1 motorway: serves Milton Keynes in the north via junctions 13 and 14 (although the former is just outside the county boundary in Bedfordshire).
* M4 motorway: passes through the very south of the county with only J7 in Bucks.
* M25 motorway: passes into Bucks but has only one junction (J16-interchange for the M40).
* M40 motorway: cuts through the south of the county serving towns such as High Wycombe and Beaconsfield.

Six important A roads also enter the county (from north to south):
* A428: has a very small section through the county, serving the northern villages of Lavendon and Cold Brayfield.
* A5: serves Milton Keynes.
* A421: serves Milton Keynes and Buckingham; links the M1 to the M40.
* A40: parallels M40 through south Bucks and continues to Central London.
* A41: cuts through the centre of the county from Watford to Bicester, serving Aylesbury.
* A4: serves Taplow in the very south.

Also less important primary A roads enter the country:
*A404: serves Marlow and High Wycombe.
*A509: serves the north of the county, starting at the A5 near Central Milton Keynes, heading north-east towards Olney via M1 J14, eventually leaving the county at Warrington for Wellingborough and Kettering.
*A4010: runs from M40 J4 (High Wycombe) to Stoke Mandeville.
*A4146: runs from Leighton Buzzard (Bedfordshire) to Milton Keynes.

The county is poorly served with internal routes, with the A413 and A418 linking the south and north of the county.

===Rail===

As part of the London commuter belt, Buckinghamshire is well connected to the national rail network, with both local commuter and inter-city services serving some destinations.

Chiltern Railways is a principal train operating company in Buckinghamshire, providing the majority of local commuter services from the centre and south of the county, with trains running into . Great Western operates commuter services from and into London Paddington. West Midlands Trains provides these services from into or , and Southern operates commuter services via the West London Line from Milton Keynes Central to East Croydon.

Avanti West Coast operates inter-city services from Milton Keynes Central to Euston, North West England, the West Midlands, the Scottish Central Belt, and North Wales. Great Western operates non-stop services through the south of the county from Paddington to South West England and South Wales.

There are four main lines running through the county:

*The West Coast Main Line in the north of the county serves stations in Milton Keynes
*London to Aylesbury Line serves Aylesbury and other settlements along the A413 towards London. Once part of the Metropolitan line of London Underground, which now runs to Amersham
*Chiltern Main Line: serves the towns along the M40 motorway including High Wycombe and Beaconsfield
*Great Western Main Line: runs through Slough. Slough is now in Berkshire, but the line enters Bucks twice, on either side of Slough, with Taplow and Iver both having stations in Buckinghamshire.

There are the following additional lines:

*Princes Risborough to Aylesbury Line: a single track branch that connects the Chiltern Main Line to the London to Aylesbury Line.
*Marston Vale Line: between Bletchley and Bedford. This is a remnant of the former Varsity Line between and 
*Marlow Branch Line: between Marlow, Bourne End and Maidenhead.
* Metropolitan line: between and to London
*Chinnor and Princes Risborough Railway, a preserved railway.
* The new Elizabeth line (constructed as Crossrail) serves Iver.

, contractors are working on behalf of the East West Rail Company to reinstate the route between and Bletchley via , enabling services to Milton Keynes Central from 2025. The line between Aylesbury and Claydon Junction may also be reinstated in the same programme, enabling services between Aylesbury and Milton Keynes, but this option is not programmed. Construction of High Speed 2 is also underway and is planned to run non-stop through the county at some future date.

==Settlements==
For the full list of towns, villages and hamlets in Buckinghamshire, see List of places in Buckinghamshire. Throughout history, there have been changes to the Buckinghamshire boundary.

==Education==

Artist and composer Harriet Anne Smart started a school in Buckinghamshire in the 1850s to teach local labourers how to read. Today, education in Buckinghamshire is governed by two Local Education Authorities, Buckinghamshire Council and Milton Keynes City Council. Buckinghamshire Council is one of the few remaining LEAs still using the tripartite system, albeit with some revisions such as the abolition of secondary technical schools. It has a completely selective education system: pupils transfer either to a grammar school or to a secondary modern school or free school depending on how they perform in the Eleven-Plus exam and on their preferences. Pupils who do not take the test can only be allocated places at secondary modern schools or free school. There are 9 independent schools and 34 maintained (state) secondary schools, not including sixth form colleges, in the county council area. There is also the Buckinghamshire University Technical College which offers secondary education from age 14. The unitary authority of Milton Keynes operates a comprehensive education system: there are 8 maintained (state) secondary schools in the City Council area.

Buckinghamshire is also home to the University of Buckingham, Buckinghamshire New University, the National Film and Television School, and the Open University. The University of Bedfordshire has a campus in Milton Keynes.

==Notable people== 

Buckinghamshire is the birthplace and/or final resting place of several notable individuals. St Osyth was born in Quarrendon and was buried in Aylesbury in the 7th century while at about the same time Saint Rumbold (or Rumwald) was buried in Buckingham. In the medieval period, Roger of Wendover and Anne Boleyn also owned property in the same town. It is said that King Henry VIII made Aylesbury the county town in preference to Buckingham because Boleyn&#x27;s father owned property there and was a regular visitor himself. Other medieval residents included Edward the Confessor, who had a palace at Brill, and John Wycliffe who lived in Ludgershall.

Buckinghamshire later became home to some notable literary characters. Edmund Waller was brought up in Beaconsfield and served as Member of Parliament (MP) for both Amersham and Wycombe. Mary Shelley and her husband Percy Bysshe Shelley lived for some time in Marlow, attracted to the town by their friend Thomas Love Peacock who also lived there. John Milton lived in Chalfont St Giles and his cottage can still be visited there and John Wilkes was MP for Aylesbury. Later authors include Jerome K. Jerome who lived at Marlow, T. S. Eliot who also lived at Marlow, Roald Dahl who lived at Great Missenden, Enid Blyton who lived in Beaconsfield and Edgar Wallace who lived at Bourne End and is buried in Little Marlow. Modern-day writers from Bucks include Terry Pratchett who was born in Beaconsfield, Tim Rice who is from Amersham and Andy Riley who is from Aylesbury.

During the Second World War a number of European politicians and statesmen were exiled in England. Many of these settled in Bucks as it is close to London. President Edvard Beneš of Czechoslovakia lived at Aston Abbotts with his family while some of his officials were stationed at nearby Addington and Wingrave. Meanwhile, Władysław Sikorski, military leader of Poland, lived at Iver and King Zog of Albania lived at Frieth. Much earlier, King Louis XVIII of France lived in exile at Hartwell House from 1809 to 1814.

Also on the local political stage Buckinghamshire has been home to Nancy Astor who lived in Cliveden, Frederick, Prince of Wales who also lived in Cliveden, Baron Carrington who lives in Bledlow, Benjamin Disraeli who lived at Hughenden Manor and was made Earl of Beaconsfield, John Hampden who was from Great Hampden and is revered in Aylesbury to this day and Prime Minister Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery who lived at Mentmore. Also worthy of note are William Penn who believed he was descended from the Penn family of Penn and so is buried nearby and the current Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, who has an official residence at Chequers. John Archdale, the colonial governor of North Carolina and South Carolina, was born in Buckinghamshire.

<doc id="55690" wikidata="Q126084" url="?curid=55690" title="Acre, Israel">
<text>Acre ( ), known in Hebrew as Akko (, ) and in Arabic as Akka (, ), is a city in the coastal plain region of the Northern District of Israel.

The city occupies a strategic location, sitting in a natural harbour at the extremity of Haifa Bay on the coast of the Mediterranean&#x27;s Levantine Sea. Aside from coastal trading, it was an important waypoint on the region&#x27;s coastal road and the road cutting inland along the Jezreel Valley. The first settlement during the Early Bronze Age was abandoned after a few centuries but a large town was established during the Middle Bronze Age. Continuously inhabited since then, it is among the oldest continuously inhabited settlements on Earth. It has, however, been subject to conquest and destruction several times and survived as little more than a large village for centuries at a time.

Acre was a hugely important city during the Crusades as a maritime foothold on the Mediterranean coast of the southern Levant and was the site of several battles, including the 1189–1191 Siege of Acre and 1291 Siege of Acre. It was the last stronghold of the Crusaders in the Holy Land prior to that final battle in 1291. At the end of Crusader rule, the city was destroyed by the Mamluks, thereafter existing as a modest fishing village until the rule of Zahir al-Umar in the 18th century.

In 1947, Acre formed part of Mandatory Palestine and had a population of 13,560, of whom 10,930 were Muslim and 2,490 were Christian. As a result of the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine and subsequent 1948 Arab–Israeli war, the population of the town dramatically changed as its Palestinian-Arab population was expelled or forced to flee; it was then resettled by Jewish immigrants. In present-day Israel, the population was in , made up of Jews, Muslims, Christians, Druze, and Baháʼís. In particular, Acre is the holiest city of the Baháʼí Faith in Israel and receives many pilgrims of that faith every year. Acre is one of Israel&#x27;s mixed cities; 32% of the city&#x27;s population is Arab. The mayor is Shimon Lankri, who was re-elected in 2018 with 85% of the vote.

==Names==
The etymology of the name is unknown. A folk etymology in Hebrew is that, when the ocean was created, it expanded until it reached Acre and then stopped, giving the city its name (in Hebrew, &quot;ad koh&quot; means &quot;up to here&quot; and no further).

Acre seems to be recorded in Egyptian hieroglyphs, probably being the in the execration texts from around 1800BC.

The Akkadian cuneiform Amarna letters also mention an &quot;Akka&quot; in the mid-14th centuryBC. On its native currency, Acre&#x27;s name was written (). It appears in Assyrian and once in Biblical Hebrew.

Acre was known to the Greeks as &quot;Ákē&quot; (), a homonym for a Greek word meaning &quot;cure&quot;. Greek legend then offered a folk etymology that Hercules had found curative herbs at the site after one of his many fights. This name was Latinized as Ace. Josephus&#x27;s histories also transcribed the city into Greek as &quot;Akre&quot;.

The city appears in the Babylonian Talmud with the Jewish Babylonian Aramaic name &quot;Talbush&quot; of uncertain etymology.

Under the Diadochi, the Ptolemaic Kingdom renamed the city Ptolemaïs (, &quot;Ptolemaΐs&quot;) and the Seleucid Empire Antioch (, &quot;Antiókheia&quot;). As both names were shared by a great many other towns, they were variously distinguished. The Syrians called it (, &quot;Antiókheia tês en Ptolemaΐdi&quot;).

Under Claudius, it was also briefly known as Germanicia in Ptolemais (, &quot;Germaníkeia tês en Ptolemaΐdi&quot;). As a Roman colony, it was notionally refounded and renamed &#x27; or &#x27; after its imperial sponsor Claudius; it was known as for short.

During the Crusades, it was officially known as Sainct-Jehan-d&#x27;Acre or more simply Acre (Modern ), after the Knights Hospitaller who had their headquarters there and whose patron saint was Saint John the Baptist. This name remained quite popular in the Christian world until modern times, often translated into the language being used: &quot;Saint John of Acre&quot; (in English), &#x27; (in Spanish), &#x27; (in Catalan), &quot;&quot; (in Italian), etc.

==History==

Acre lies at the northern end of a wide bay with Mount Carmel at the south. It is the best natural roadstead on the southern Phoenician coast and has easy access to the Valley of Jezreel. It was settled early and has always been important for the fleets of kingdoms and empires contesting the area, serving as the main port for the entire southern Levant up to the modern era.

The ancient town was located atop Tel ʿAkkō (Hebrew) or Tell al-Fuḫḫār (Arabic), east of the present city and north of the Na&#x27;aman River. In antiquity, however, it formed an easily protected peninsula directly beside the former mouth of the Na&#x27;aman or Belus. 

===Early Bronze Age===
The earliest discovered settlement dates to around 3000BC during the Early Bronze Age, but appears to have been abandoned after a few centuries, possibly because of inundation of its surrounding farmland by the Mediterranean.

===Middle Bronze Age===
Acre was resettled as an urban centre during the Middle Bronze Age (–1550BC) and has been continuously inhabited since then. Egyptian execration texts record one 18th-century ruler as Tūra-ʿAmmu (Tꜣʿmw). Further to the north was the important MBA site of Tel Kabri dominating the Akko plain.

===Late Bronze Age===
Acre was listed as &quot;Aak&quot; among the conquests of the Egyptian pharaoh Thutmose III.

====Amarna period====

In the Amarna Period ( BC), there was turmoil in Egypt&#x27;s Levantine provinces. The Amarna Archive contains letters concerning the ruler(s) of Acco. In one, King Biridiya of Megiddo complains to Amenhotep III or Akhenaten of the king of Acre, whom he accuses of treason for releasing the captured Hapiru king Labaya of Shechem instead of delivering him to Egypt. Excavations of Tel ʿAkkō have shown that this period of Acre involved industrial production of pottery, metal, and other trade goods.

In Amarna Letter EA 232, Surata (msu₂-ra-ta) is the Man of Akka (LU₂ uruak-ka). The letter is sent to the King of Egypt, and it contains Canaanite glosses. Surata is also mentioned in letters from Byblos (EA 085), Gath (EA 366), and Megiddo (EA 245).

===Iron Age===
Acre continued as a Phoenician city and was referenced as a Phoenician city by the Assyrians. Josephus, however, claimed it as a province of the Kingdom of Israel under Solomon.

Around 725BC, Acre joined Sidon and Tyre in a revolt against the Neo-Assyrian emperor Shalmaneser V. There is a clear destruction layer in the ruins, probably dating to the 7th century BC.

===Persian period and classical-Greek antiquity===

Acre served as a major port of the Persian Empire, with Strabo noting its importance in campaigns against the Egyptians. According to Strabo and Diodurus Siculus, Cambyses II attacked Egypt after massing a huge army on the plains near the city of Acre. The Persians expanded the town westward and probably improved its harbor and defenses. In December 2018, archaeologists digging at the site of Tell Keisan in Acre unearthed the remains of a Persian military outpost that might have played a role in the successful 525 BC Achaemenid invasion of Egypt. The city&#x27;s industrial production continued into the late Persian era, with particularly expanded iron works.

The Persian-period fortifications at Tell Keisan were later heavily damaged during Alexander&#x27;s fourth-century BC campaign to drive the Achaemenids out of the Levant.

After Alexander&#x27;s death, his main generals divided his empire among themselves. At first, the Egyptian Ptolemies held the land around Acre. PtolemyII renamed the city Ptolemais in his own and his father&#x27;s honour in the 260sBC.

 conquered the town for the Syrian Seleucids in 200BC. In the late 170s or early 160sBC, AntiochusIV founded a Greek colony in the town, which he named Antioch after himself.

About 165BC Judas Maccabeus defeated the Seleucids in several battles in Galilee, and drove them into Ptolemais. About 153BC Alexander Balas, son of Antiochus IV Epiphanes, contesting the Seleucid crown with Demetrius, seized the city, which opened its gates to him. Demetrius offered many bribes to the Maccabees to obtain Jewish support against his rival, including the revenues of Ptolemais for the benefit of the Temple in Jerusalem, but in vain. Jonathan Apphus threw in his lot with Alexander; Alexander and Demetrius met in battle and the latter was killed. In 150BC Alexander received Jonathan with great honour in Ptolemais. Some years later, however, Tryphon, an officer of the Seleucid Empire, who had grown suspicious of the Maccabees, enticed Jonathan into Ptolemais and there treacherously took him prisoner.

The city was captured by Alexander Jannaeus (ruled –76BC), Tigranes the Great (r. 95–55BC), and Cleopatra (r. 51–30BC). Here Herod the Great (r. 37–4BC) built a gymnasium.

===Roman colony===

Around 37 BC, the Romans conquered the Hellenized Phoenician port-city called Akko. It became a colony in southern Roman Phoenicia, called &quot;Colonia Claudia Felix Ptolemais Garmanica Stabilis&quot;. Ptolemais stayed Roman for nearly seven centuries until 636 AD, when it was conquered by the Muslim Arabs. Under Augustus, a gymnasium was built in the city. In 4 BC, the Roman proconsul Publius Quinctilius Varus assembled his army there in order to suppress the revolts that broke out in the region following the death of Herod the Great.

During the rule of the emperor Claudius there was a building drive in Ptolemais and veterans of the legions settled here. The city was one of four colonies (with Berytus, Aelia Capitolina and Caesarea Maritima) created in the ancient Levant by Roman emperors for Roman veterans.

During the Great Jewish Revolt (66–73 CE), Acre functioned as a staging point for both Cestius&#x27;s and Vespasian&#x27;s campaigns to suppress the revolt in Judaea.

The city was a center of Romanization in the region, but most of the population was made of local Phoenicians and Jews: as a consequence after the Hadrian times the descendants of the initial Roman colonists no longer spoke Latin and had become fully assimilated in less than two centuries (however the local society&#x27;s customs were Roman).

The Christian &quot;Acts of the Apostles&quot; describes Luke the Evangelist, Paul the Apostle and their companions spending a day in Ptolemais with their Christian brethren.

An important Roman colony (&quot;&quot;) was established at the city that greatly increased the control of the region by the Romans over the next century with Roman colonists translated there from Italy. The Romans enlarged the port and the city grew to more than 20,000 inhabitants in the second century under emperor Hadrian. Ptolemais greatly flourished for two more centuries.

===Byzantine period===
After the permanent division of the Roman Empire in 395 AD, Ptolemais was administered by the successor state, the Byzantine Empire. The city started to lose importance and in the seventh century was reduced to a small settlement of less than one thousand inhabitants.

===Early Islamic period===
Following the defeat of the Byzantine army of Heraclius by the Rashidun army of Khalid ibn al-Walid in the Battle of Yarmouk, and the capitulation of the Christian city of Jerusalem to the Caliph Umar, Acre came under the rule of the Rashidun Caliphate beginning in 638. According to the early Muslim chronicler al-Baladhuri, the actual conquest of Acre was led by Shurahbil ibn Hasana, and it likely surrendered without resistance. The Arab conquest brought a revival to the town of Acre, and it served as the main port of Palestine through the Umayyad and Abbasid Caliphates that followed, and through Crusader rule into the 13th century.

The first Umayyad caliph, Muawiyah I (r. 661–680), regarded the coastal towns of the Levant as strategically important. Thus, he strengthened Acre&#x27;s fortifications and settled Persians from other parts of Muslim Syria to inhabit the city. From Acre, which became one of the region&#x27;s most important dockyards along with Tyre, Mu&#x27;awiyah launched an attack against Byzantine-held Cyprus. The Byzantines assaulted the coastal cities in 669, prompting Mu&#x27;awiyah to assemble and send shipbuilders and carpenters to Acre. The city would continue to serve as the principal naval base of Jund al-Urdunn (&quot;Military District of Jordan&quot;) until the reign of Caliph Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik (723–743), who moved the bulk of the shipyards north to Tyre. Nonetheless, Acre remained militarily significant through the early Abbasid period, with Caliph al-Mutawakkil issuing an order to make Acre into a major naval base in 861, equipping the city with battleships and combat troops.

During the 10th century, Acre was still part of Jund al-Urdunn. Local Arab geographer al-Muqaddasi visited Acre during the early Fatimid Caliphate in 985, describing it as a fortified coastal city with a large mosque possessing a substantial olive grove. Fortifications had been previously built by the autonomous Emir Ibn Tulun of Egypt, who annexed the city in the 870s, and provided relative safety for merchant ships arriving at the city&#x27;s port. When Persian traveller Nasir Khusraw visited Acre in 1047, he noted that the large Jama Masjid was built of marble, located in the centre of the city and just south of it lay the &quot;tomb of the Prophet Salih.&quot; Khusraw provided a description of the city&#x27;s size, which roughly translated as having a length of and a width of . This figure indicates that Acre at that time was larger than its current Old City area, most of which was built between the 18th and 19th centuries.

===Crusader and Ayyubid period===
====First Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem (1104–1187)====

After four years, the siege of Acre was successfully completed in 1104, with the city capitulating to the forces of King Baldwin I of Jerusalem following the First Crusade. The Crusaders made the town their chief port in the Kingdom of Jerusalem. On the first Crusade, Fulcher relates his travels with the Crusading armies of King Baldwin, including initially staying over in Acre before the army&#x27;s advance to Jerusalem. This demonstrates that even from the beginning, Acre was an important link between the Crusaders and their advance into the Levant. Its function was to provide Crusaders with a foothold in the region and access to vibrant trade that made them prosperous, especially giving them access to the Asiatic spice trade. By the 1130s it had a population of around 25,000 and was only matched for size in the Crusader kingdom by the city of Jerusalem. Around 1170 it became the main port of the eastern Mediterranean, and the kingdom of Jerusalem was regarded in the west as enormously wealthy above all because of Acre. According to an English contemporary, it provided more for the Crusader crown than the total revenues of the king of England.

The Andalusian geographer Ibn Jubayr wrote that in 1185 there was still a Muslim community in the city who worshipped in a small mosque.

====Ayyubid intermezzo (1187–1191)====

Acre, along with Beirut and Sidon, capitulated without a fight to the Ayyubid sultan Saladin in 1187, after his decisive victory at Hattin and the subsequent Muslim capture of Jerusalem.

====Second Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem (1191–1291)====

Acre remained in Muslim hands until it was unexpectedly besieged by King Guy of Lusignan—reinforced by Pisan naval and ground forces—in August 1189. The siege was unique in the history of the Crusades since the Frankish besiegers were themselves besieged, by Saladin&#x27;s troops. It was not captured until July 1191 when the forces of the Third Crusade, led by King Richard I of England and King Philip II of France, came to King Guy&#x27;s aid. Acre then served as the &quot;de facto&quot; capital of the remnant Kingdom of Jerusalem in 1192. During the siege, German merchants from Lübeck and Bremen had founded a field hospital, which became the nucleus of the chivalric Teutonic Order. Upon the Sixth Crusade, the city was placed under the administration of the Knights Hospitaller military order. Acre continued to prosper as major commercial hub of the eastern Mediterranean, but also underwent turbulent times due to the bitter infighting among the Crusader factions that occasionally resulted in civil wars.

In 1232, as a result of the inter-Christian War of the Lombards between the local barons and Emperor Frederick II, Acre organised itself as a commune under the mayorship of John of Ibelin.

The old part of the city, where the port and fortified city were located, protrudes from the coastline, exposing both sides of the narrow piece of land to the sea. This could maximize its efficiency as a port, and the narrow entrance to this protrusion served as a natural and easy defense to the city. Both the archaeological record and Crusader texts emphasize Acre&#x27;s strategic importance—a city in which it was crucial to pass through, control, and, as evidenced by the massive walls, protect.

Acre was the final major stronghold of the Crusader states when much of the Levantine coastline was conquered by Mamluk forces. Acre itself fell to Sultan Al-Ashraf Khalil in 1291.

===Mamluk period (1291–1517)===
Acre, having been isolated and largely abandoned by Europe, was conquered by Mamluk sultan al-Ashraf Khalil in a bloody siege in 1291. In line with Mamluk policy regarding the coastal cities (to prevent their future utilization by Crusader forces), Acre was entirely destroyed, with the exception of a few religious edifices considered sacred by the Muslims, namely the Nabi Salih tomb and the Ayn Bakar spring. The destruction of the city led to popular Arabic sayings in the region enshrining its past glory.

In 1321 the Syrian geographer Abu&#x27;l-Fida wrote that Acre was &quot;a beautiful city&quot; but still in ruins following its capture by the Mamluks. Nonetheless, the &quot;spacious&quot; port was still in use and the city was full of artisans. Throughout the Mamluk era (1260–1517), Acre was succeeded by Safed as the principal city of its province.

===Ottoman period===


Incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517, it appeared in the census of 1596, located in the &quot;Nahiya&quot; of Acca of the &quot;Liwa&quot; of Safad. The population was 81 households and 15 bachelors, all Muslim. They paid a fixed tax-rate of 25% on agricultural products, including wheat, barley, cotton, goats, and beehives, water buffaloes, in addition to occasional revenues and market toll, a total of 20,500 Akçe. Half of the revenue went to a Waqf. English academic Henry Maundrell in 1697 found it a ruin, save for a &quot;khan&quot; (caravanserai) built and occupied by French merchants for their use, a mosque and a few poor cottages. The &quot;khan&quot; was named Khan al-Ilfranj after its French founders.

During Ottoman rule, Acre continued to play an important role in the region via smaller autonomous sheikhdoms. Towards the end of the 18th century Acre revived under the rule of Zahir al-Umar, the Arab ruler of the Galilee, who made the city capital of his autonomous sheikhdom. Zahir rebuilt Acre&#x27;s fortifications, using materials from the city&#x27;s medieval ruins. He died outside its walls during an offensive against him by the Ottoman state in 1775.

Umar&#x27;s successor, Jazzar Pasha, further fortified its walls when he virtually moved the capital of the Saida Eyelet (&quot;Province of Sidon&quot;) to Acre where he resided. Jazzar&#x27;s improvements were accomplished through heavy imposts secured for himself all the benefits derived from his improvements. About 1780, Jazzar peremptorily banished the French trading colony, in spite of protests from the French government, and refused to receive a consul. Both Zahir and Jazzar undertook ambitious architectural projects in the city, building several caravanserais, mosques, public baths and other structures. Some of the notable works included the Al-Jazzar Mosque, which was built out of stones from the ancient ruins of Caesarea and Atlit and the Khan al-Umdan, both built on Jazzar&#x27;s orders. Under Jazzar, Acre thrived, becoming the third largest city in Ottoman Syria. Its population, then largely composed of migrants drawn by its burgeoning development, is estimated at twenty thousand.

In 1799 Napoleon, in pursuance of his scheme for raising a Syrian rebellion against Turkish domination, appeared before Acre, but after a siege of two months (March–May) was repulsed by the Turks, aided by Sir Sidney Smith and a force of British sailors. Having lost his siege cannons to Smith, Napoleon attempted to lay siege to the walled city defended by Ottoman troops on 20 March 1799, using only his infantry and small-calibre cannons, a strategy which failed, leading to his retreat two months later on 21 May.

Jazzar was succeeded on his death by his &quot;mamluk&quot;, Sulayman Pasha al-Adil, under whose milder rule the town advanced in prosperity till his death in 1819. After his death, Haim Farhi, who was his adviser, paid a huge sum in bribes to assure that Abdullah Pasha (son of Ali Pasha, the deputy of Sulayman Pasha), whom he had known from youth, will be appointed as ruler—which didn&#x27;t stop the new ruler from assassinating Farhi. Abdullah Pasha ruled Acre until 1831, when Ibrahim Pasha besieged and reduced the town and destroyed its buildings. During the Oriental Crisis of 1840 it was bombarded on 4 November 1840 by the allied British, Austrian and French squadrons, and in the following year restored to Turkish rule. It regained some of its former prosperity after linking with the Hejaz Railway by a branch line from Haifa in 1913. It was the capital of the Acre Sanjak in the Beirut Vilayet until the British captured the city on 23 September 1918 during World War I.

===Mandatory Palestine===

At the beginning of the Mandate period, in the 1922 census of Palestine, Acre had 6,420 residents: 4,883 of whom were Muslim; 1,344 Christian; 102 Baháʼí; 78 Jewish and 13 Druze. The 1931 census counted 7,897 people in Acre, 6,076 Muslims, 1,523 Christians, 237 Jews, 51 Baháʼí and 10 Druze. In the 1945 census Acre&#x27;s population numbered 12,360; 9,890 Muslims, 2,330 Christians, 50 Jews and 90 classified as &quot;other&quot;.
Acre&#x27;s fort was converted into a jail, where members of the Jewish underground were held during their struggle against the Mandate authorities, among them Ze&#x27;ev Jabotinsky, Shlomo Ben-Yosef, and Dov Gruner. Gruner and Ben-Yosef were executed there. Other Jewish inmates were freed by members of the Irgun, who broke into the jail on 4 May 1947 and succeeded in releasing Jewish underground movement activists. Over 200 Arab inmates also escaped.

===1948 Palestine War===
In the 1947 United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, Acre was designated part of a future Arab state. On 18 March 4 technicians from the Palestine Electric Company and five British soldiers in their escort were killed while travelling to mend a cable in an RAF camp, when an Arab ambush exploded a mine on the route just outside the Moslem cemetery east of Acre The Haganah responded by blowing up a bridge outside the city and derailing a train. Before the 1948 Arab-Israeli War broke out, the Carmeli Brigade&#x27;s 21 Battalion commander had repeatedly damaged the Al-Kabri aqueduct that furnished Acre with water, and when Arab repairs managed to restore water supply, then resorted to pouring flasks of typhoid and dysentery bacteria into the aqueduct, as part of a biological warfare programme. At some time in late April or early May 1948, - Jewish forces had cut the town&#x27;s electricity supply responsible for pumping water - a typhoid epidemic broke out. Israeli officials later credited the facility with which they conquered the town in part to the effects of the demoralization induced by the epidemic.

Israel&#x27;s Carmeli forces attacked on May 16 and, after an ultimatum was delivered that, unless the inhabitants surrendered, &#x27;we will destroy you to the last man and utterly,&#x27; the town notables signed an instrument of surrender on the night between 17 and 18 May 1948. 60 bodies were found and about three-quarters of the Arab population of the city (13,510 of 17,395) were displaced.

=== Israel ===

Throughout the 1950s, many Jewish neighbourhoods were established at the northern and eastern parts of the city, as it became a development town, designated to absorb numerous Jewish immigrants, largely Jews from Morocco. The old city of Akko remained largely Arab Muslim (including several Bedouin families), with an Arab Christian neighbourhood in close proximity. The city also attracted worshippers of the Baháʼí Faith, some of whom became permanent residents in the city, where the Baháʼí Mansion of Bahjí is located. Acre has also served as a base for important events in Baháʼí history, including being the birthplace of Shoghi Effendi, and the short-lived schism between Baháʼís initiated by the attacks by Mírzá Muhammad ʻAlí against ʻAbdu&#x27;l-Bahá. Baháʼís have since commemorated various events that have occurred in the city, including the imprisonment of Baháʼu&#x27;lláh.

In the 1990s, the city absorbed thousands of Jews who immigrated from the former Soviet Union. Within several years, however, the population balance between Jews and Arabs shifted backwards, as northern neighbourhoods were abandoned by many of its Jewish residents in favour of new housing projects in nearby Nahariya, while many Muslim Arabs moved in (largely coming from nearby Arab villages). Nevertheless, the city still has a clear Jewish majority; in 2011, the population of 46,000 included 30,000 Jews and 14,000 Arabs.

Ethnic tensions erupted in the city on 8 October 2008 after an Arab citizen drove through a predominantly Jewish neighbourhood during Yom Kippur, leading to five days of violence between Arabs and Jews.

In 2009, the population of Acre reached 46,300. In 2018 Shimon Lankri was re-elected mayor with 85% of the vote.

==Climate==
Acre has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csa&quot;).

==Demography==
Today there are roughly 48,000 people who live in Acre. Among Israeli cities, Acre has a relatively high proportion of non-Jewish residents, with 32% of the population being Arab. In 2000, 95% of the residents in the Old City were Arab. Only about 15% of the current Arab population in the city descends from families who lived there before 1948.

Acre is home to Jews, Muslims, Christians, Druze, and Baháʼís. In particular, Acre is the holiest city of the Baháʼí Faith and receives many pilgrims of that faith every year.

In 1999, there were 22 schools in Acre with an enrollment of 15,000 children.

==Transportation==

The Acre central bus station, served by Egged and Nateev Express, offers intra-city and inter-city bus routes to destinations all over Israel. Nateev Express is currently contracted to provide the intra-city bus routes within Acre. The city is also served by the Acre Railway Station, which is on the main Coastal railway line to Nahariya, with southerly trains to Beersheba and Modi&#x27;in-Maccabim-Re&#x27;ut.

==Education and culture==

The Sir Charles Clore Jewish-Arab Community Centre in the Kiryat Wolfson neighbourhood runs youth clubs and programs for Jewish and Arab children. In 1990, Mohammed Faheli, an Arab resident of Acre, founded the Acre Jewish-Arab association, which originally operated out of two bomb shelters. In 1993, Dame Vivien Duffield of the Clore Foundation donated funds for a new building. Among the programs offered is Peace Child Israel, which employs theatre and the arts to teach coexistence. The participants, Jews and Arabs, spend two months studying conflict resolution and then work together to produce an original theatrical performance that addresses the issues they have explored. Another program is Patriots of Acre, a community responsibility and youth tourism program that teaches children to become ambassadors for their city. In the summer, the centre runs an Arab-Jewish summer camp for 120 disadvantaged children aged 5–11. Some 1,000 children take part in the Acre Centre&#x27;s youth club and youth programming every week. Adult education programs have been developed for Arab women interested in completing their high school education and acquiring computer skills to prepare for joining the workforce. The centre also offers parenting courses, and music and dance classes.

The Acco Festival of Alternative Israeli Theatre is an annual event that takes place in October, coinciding with the holiday of Sukkot. The festival, inaugurated in 1979, provides a forum for non-conventional theatre, attracting local and overseas theatre companies. Theatre performances by Jewish and Arab producers are staged at indoor and outdoor venues around the city.

==Sports==

The city&#x27;s football team, Hapoel Acre F.C., is a member of the Israeli Premier League, the top tier of Israeli football. They play in the Acre Municipal Stadium which was opened in September 2011. At the end of the 2008–2009 season, the club finished in the top five, and was promoted to the top tier for a second time, after an absence of 31 years. 

In the past the city was also home to Maccabi Acre. However, the club was relocated to nearby Kiryat Ata and was renamed Maccabi Ironi Kiryat Ata. 

Other current active clubs are Ahi Acre and the newly formed Maccabi Ironi Acre, both playing in Liga Bet. Both club also host their matches in the Acre Municipal Stadium. 

==Landmarks==
Acre&#x27;s Old City has been designated by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. Since the 1990s, large-scale archaeological excavations have been undertaken and efforts are being made to preserve ancient sites. In 2009, renovations were planned for Khan al-Umdan, the &quot;Inn of the Columns,&quot; the largest of several Ottoman inns still standing in Acre. It was built near the port at the end of the 18th century by Jazzar Pasha. Merchants who arrived at the port would unload their wares on the first floor and sleep in lodgings on the second floor. In 1906, a clock tower was added over the main entrance marking the 25th anniversary of the reign of the Turkish sultan, Abdul Hamid II.

===City walls===

In 1750, Zahir al-Umar, the ruler of Acre, utilized the remnants of the Crusader walls as a foundation for his walls. Two gates were set in the wall, the &quot;land gate&quot; in the eastern wall, and the &quot;sea gate&quot; in the southern wall. The walls were reinforced between 1775 and 1799 by Jazzar Pasha and survived Napoleon&#x27;s siege. The wall was thin, at only , and rose to a height of between and .

A heavy land defensive wall was built north and east to the city in 1800–1814 by Jazzar Pasha and his Jewish advisor, Haim Farhi. It consists of a modern counter-artillery fortification which includes a thick defensive wall, a dry moat, cannon outposts and three &quot;burges&quot; (large defensive towers). Since then, no major modifications have taken place. The sea wall, which remains mostly complete, is the original wall built by Zahir that was reinforced by Jazzar Pasha. In 1910, two additional gates were set in the walls, one in the northern wall and one in the north-western corner of the city. In 1912, the Acre lighthouse was built on the south-western corner of the walls.

===Al-Jazzar Mosque===
Al-Jazzar Mosque was built in 1781. Jazzar Pasha and his successor, Sulayman Pasha al-Adil, are both buried in a small graveyard adjacent to the mosque. In a shrine on the second level of the mosque, a single hair from Muhammad&#x27;s beard is kept and shown on special ceremonial occasions.

===Hamam al-Basha===
Built in 1795 by Jazzar Pasha, Acre&#x27;s Turkish bath has a series of hot rooms and a hexagonal steam room with a marble fountain. It was used by the Irgun as a bridge to break into the citadel&#x27;s prison. The bathhouse kept functioning until 1950.

===Citadel of Acre===
The current building which constitutes the citadel of Acre is an Ottoman fortification, built on the foundation of the citadel of the Knights Hospitaller. The citadel was part of the city&#x27;s defensive formation, reinforcing the northern wall. During the 20th century the citadel was used mainly as Acre Prison and as the site for a gallows. During the Palestinian mandate period, activists of Arab nationalist and the Jewish Zionist movements were held prisoner there; some were executed there.

===Hospitaller fortress===

Under the citadel and prison of Acre, archaeological excavations revealed a complex of halls, which was built and used by the Knights Hospitaller. This complex was a part of the Hospitallers citadel, which was included in the northern defences of Acre. The complex includes six semi-joined halls, one recently excavated large hall, a dungeon, a refectory (dining room) and remains of a Gothic church.

===Other medieval sites===
Other medieval European remains include the Church of Saint George and adjacent houses at the Genovese Square (called Kikar ha-Genovezim or Kikar Genoa in Hebrew). There were also residential quarters and marketplaces run by merchants from Pisa and Amalfi in Crusader and medieval Acre. 
===Baháʼí holy places===
There are many Baháʼí holy places in and around Acre. They originate from Baháʼu&#x27;lláh&#x27;s imprisonment in the Citadel during Ottoman Rule. The final years of Baháʼu&#x27;lláh&#x27;s life were spent in the Mansion of Bahjí, just outside Acre, even though he was still formally a prisoner of the Ottoman Empire. Baháʼu&#x27;lláh died on 29 May 1892 in Bahjí, and the Shrine of Baháʼu&#x27;lláh is the most holy place for Baháʼís — their Qiblih, the location they face when saying their daily prayers. It contains the remains of Baháʼu&#x27;lláh and is near the spot where he died in the Mansion of Bahjí. Other Baháʼí sites in Acre are the House of ʻAbbúd (where Baháʼu&#x27;lláh and his family resided) and the House of ʻAbdu&#x27;lláh Páshá (where later ʻAbdu&#x27;l-Bahá resided with his family), and the Garden of Ridván where he spent the end of his life. In 2008, the Baháʼí holy places in Acre and Haifa were added to the UNESCO World Heritage List.

==Archaeology==

Excavations at Tell Akko began in 1973. In 2012, archaeologists excavating at the foot of the city&#x27;s southern seawall found a quay and other evidence of a 2,300-year old port. Mooring stones weighing 250–300 kilograms each were unearthed at the edge of a 5-meter long stone platform chiseled in Phoenician-style, thought to be an installation that helped raise military vessels from the water onto the shore.

===Crusader period remains===

Under the citadel and prison of Acre, archaeological excavations revealed a complex of halls, which was built and used by the Hospitallers Knights. This complex was a part of the Hospitallers&#x27; citadel, which was combined in the northern wall of Acre. The complex includes six semi-joined halls, one recently excavated large hall, a dungeon, a refectory (dining hall) and remains of an ancient Gothic church.

Medieval European remains include the Church of Saint George and adjacent houses at the Genovese Square (Kikar ha-Genovezim or Kikar Genoa in Hebrew). There were also residential quarters and marketplaces run by merchants from Pisa and Amalfi in Crusader and medieval Acre.

In March 2017, marine archaeologists from Haifa University announced the discovery of the wreck of a crusader ship with treasure dating back to 1062-1250 AD. Excavators teams also unearthed ceramic bowls and jugs from places as Syria, Cyprus and southern Italy. The researchers thought the golden coins could be used as a bribe to boat owners in hopes of buying their escape. Robert Kool of the IAA identified these 30 coins as florins.

<text>Turquoise is an opaque, blue-to-green mineral that is a hydrous phosphate of copper and aluminium, with the chemical formula . It is rare and valuable in finer grades and has been prized as a gemstone for millennia due to its hue.

Like most other opaque gems, turquoise has been devalued by the introduction of treatments, imitations, and synthetics into the market. The robin egg blue or sky blue color of the Persian turquoise mined near the modern city of Nishapur, Iran, has been used as a guiding reference for evaluating turquoise quality.

==Names==
The word &quot;turquoise&quot; dates to the 17th century and is derived from the Old French &quot;turquois&quot; meaning &quot;Turkish&quot; because the mineral was first brought to Europe through the Ottoman Empire. However, according to Etymonline, the word dates to the 14th century with the form &quot;turkeis&quot;, meaning &quot;Turkish&quot;, which was replaced with &quot;turqueise&quot; from French in the 1560s. According to the same source, the gemstone was first brought to Europe from Turkestan or another Turkic territory. Pliny the Elder referred to the mineral as &quot;callais&quot; (from Ancient Greek ) and the Aztecs knew it as &quot;chalchihuitl&quot;.

In professional mineralogy, until the mid-19th century, the scientific names &quot;kalaite&quot; or azure spar were also used, which simultaneously provided a version of the mineral origin of turquoise. However, these terms did not become widespread and gradually fell out of use.

== Properties ==
The finest of turquoise reaches a maximum Mohs hardness of just under 6, or slightly more than window glass. Characteristically a cryptocrystalline mineral, turquoise almost never forms single crystals, and all of its properties are highly variable. X-ray diffraction testing shows its crystal system to be triclinic. With lower hardness comes greater porosity. The lustre of turquoise is typically waxy to subvitreous, and its transparency is usually opaque, but may be semitranslucent in thin sections. Colour is as variable as the mineral&#x27;s other properties, ranging from white to a powder blue to a sky blue and from a blue-green to a yellowish green. The blue is attributed to idiochromatic copper while the green may be the result of iron impurities (replacing copper.)

The refractive index of turquoise varies from 1.61 to 1.65 on the three crystal axes, with birefringence 0.040, biaxial positive, as measured from rare single crystals.

Crushed turquoise is soluble in hot hydrochloric acid. Its streak is white to greenish to blue, and its fracture is smooth to conchoidal. Despite its low hardness relative to other gems, turquoise takes a good polish. Turquoise may also be peppered with flecks of pyrite or interspersed with dark, spidery limonite veining.

Turquoise is nearly always cryptocrystalline and massive and assumes no definite external shape. Crystals, even at the microscopic scale, are rare. Typically the form is a vein or fracture filling, nodular, or botryoidal in habit. Stalactite forms have been reported. Turquoise may also pseudomorphously replace feldspar, apatite, other minerals, or even fossils. Odontolite is fossil bone or ivory that has historically been thought to have been altered by turquoise or similar phosphate minerals such as the iron phosphate vivianite. Intergrowth with other secondary copper minerals such as chrysocolla is also common. Turquoise is distinguished from chrysocolla, the only common mineral with similar properties, by its greater hardness.

Turquoise forms a complete solid solution series with chalcosiderite, , in which ferric iron replaces aluminium.

== Formation ==

Turquoise deposits probably form in more than one way. However, a typical turquoise deposit begins with hydrothermal deposition of copper sulfides. This takes place when hydrothermal fluids leach copper from a host rock, which is typically an intrusion of calc-alkaline rock with a moderate to high silica content that is relatively oxidized. The copper is redeposited in more concentrated form as a copper porphyry, in which veins of copper sulfide fill joints and fractures in the rock. Deposition takes place mostly in the potassic alteration zone, which is characterized by conversion of existing feldspar to potassium feldspar and deposition of quartz and micas at a temperature of 

Turquoise is a secondary or supergene mineral, not present in the original copper porphyry. It forms when meteoric water (rain or snow melt infiltrating the Earth&#x27;s surface) percolates through the copper porphyry. Dissolved oxygen in the water oxidizes the copper sulfides to soluble sulfates, and the acidic, copper-laden solution then reacts with aluminum and potassium minerals in the host rock to precipitate turquoise. This typically fills veins in volcanic rock or phosphate-rich sediments. Deposition usually takes place at a relatively low temperature, , and seems to occur more readily in arid environments.

Turquoise in the Sinai Peninsula is found in lower Carboniferous sandstones overlain by basalt flows and upper Carboniferous limestone. The overlying beds were presumably the source of the copper, which precipitated as turquoise in nodules, horizontal seams, or vertical joints in the sandstone beds. The classical Iranian deposits are found in sandstones and limestones of Tertiary age were intruded by apatite-rich porphyritic trachytes and mafic rock. Supergene alteration fractured the rock and converted some of the minerals in the rock to alunite, which freed aluminum and phosphate to combine with copper from oxidized copper sulfides to form turquoise. This process took place at a relatively shallow depth, and by 1965 the mines had &quot;bottomed&quot; at a depth averaging just below the surface.

Turquoise deposits are widespread in North America. Some deposits, such as those of Saguache and Conejos Counties in Colorado or the Cerrillos Hills in New Mexico, are typical supergene deposits formed from copper porphyries. The deposits in Cochise County, Arizona, are found in Cambrian quartzites and geologically young granites and go down at least as deep as .

== Occurrence ==

Turquoise was among the first gems to be mined, and many historic sites have been depleted, though some are still worked to this day. These are all small-scale operations, often seasonal owing to the limited scope and remoteness of the deposits. Most are worked by hand with little or no mechanization. However, turquoise is often recovered as a byproduct of large-scale copper mining operations, especially in the United States.
 Deposits typically take the form of small veins in partially decomposed volcanic rock in arid climates.

=== Iran ===
Iran has been an important source of turquoise for at least 2,000 years. It was initially named by Iranians &quot;pērōzah&quot; meaning &quot;victory&quot;, and later the Arabs called it &quot;&quot;fayrūzah&quot;, which is pronounced in Modern Persian as &quot;fīrūzeh&quot;&quot;. In Iranian architecture, the blue turquoise was used to cover the domes of palaces because its intense blue colour was also a symbol of heaven on earth.
This deposit is blue naturally and turns green when heated due to dehydration. It is restricted to a mine-riddled region in Nishapur, the mountain peak of Ali-mersai near Mashhad, the capital of Khorasan Province, Iran. Weathered and broken trachyte is host to the turquoise, which is found both &quot;in situ&quot; between layers of limonite and sandstone and amongst the scree at the mountain&#x27;s base. These workings are the oldest known, together with those of the Sinai Peninsula. Iran also has turquoise mines in Semnan and Kerman provinces.

=== Sinai ===
Since at least the First Dynasty (3000 BCE) in ancient Egypt, and possibly before then, turquoise was used by the Egyptians and was mined by them in the Sinai Peninsula. This region was known as the &quot;Country of Turquoise&quot; by the native Monitu. There are six mines in the peninsula, all on its southwest coast, covering an area of some . The two most important of these mines, from a historical perspective, are Serabit el-Khadim and Wadi Maghareh, believed to be among the oldest of known mines. The former mine is situated about 4 kilometres from an ancient temple dedicated to the deity Hathor.

The turquoise is found in sandstone that is, or was originally, overlain by basalt. Copper and iron workings are present in the area. Large-scale turquoise mining is not profitable today, but the deposits are sporadically quarried by Bedouin peoples using homemade gunpowder. In the rainy winter months, miners face a risk from flash flooding; even in the dry season, death from the collapse of the haphazardly exploited sandstone mine walls may occur. The colour of Sinai material is typically greener than that of Iranian material but is thought to be stable and fairly durable. Often referred to as &quot;Egyptian turquoise&quot;, Sinai material is typically the most translucent, and under magnification, its surface structure is revealed to be peppered with dark blue discs not seen in material from other localities.

=== United States ===


The Southwest United States is a significant source of turquoise; Arizona, California (San Bernardino, Imperial, Inyo counties), Colorado (Conejos, El Paso, Lake, Saguache counties), New Mexico (Eddy, Grant, Otero, Santa Fe counties) and Nevada (Clark, Elko, Esmeralda County, Eureka, Lander, Mineral County and Nye counties) are (or were) especially rich. The deposits of California and New Mexico were mined by pre-Columbian Native Americans using stone tools, some local and some from as far away as central Mexico. Cerrillos, New Mexico is thought to be the location of the oldest mines; prior to the 1920s, the state was the country&#x27;s largest producer; it is more or less exhausted today. Only one mine in California, located at Apache Canyon, operates at a commercial capacity today.

The turquoise occurs as vein or seam fillings, and as compact nuggets; these are mostly small in size. While quite fine material is sometimes found, rivalling Iranian material in both colour and durability, most American turquoise is of a low grade (called &quot;chalk turquoise&quot;); high iron levels mean greens and yellows predominate, and a typically friable consistency in the turquoise&#x27;s untreated state precludes use in jewelry.

Arizona is currently the most important producer of turquoise by value. Several mines exist in the state, two of them famous for their unique colour and quality and considered the best in the industry: the Sleeping Beauty Mine in Globe ceased turquoise mining in August 2012. The mine chose to send all ore to the crusher and to concentrate on copper production due to the rising price of copper on the world market. The price of natural untreated Sleeping Beauty turquoise has risen dramatically since the mine&#x27;s closing. The Kingman Mine as of 2015 still operates alongside a copper mine outside of the city. Other mines include the Blue Bird mine, Castle Dome, and Ithaca Peak, but they are mostly inactive due to the high cost of operations and federal regulations. The Phelps Dodge Lavender Pit mine at Bisbee ceased operations in 1974 and never had a turquoise contractor. All Bisbee turquoise was &quot;lunch pail&quot; mined. It came out of the copper ore mine in miners&#x27; lunch pails. Morenci and Turquoise Peak are either inactive or depleted.

Nevada is the country&#x27;s other major producer, with more than 120 mines which have yielded significant quantities of turquoise. Unlike elsewhere in the US, most Nevada mines have been worked primarily for their gem turquoise and very little has been recovered as a byproduct of other mining operations. Nevada turquoise is found as s, fracture fillings and in breccias as the cement filling interstices between fragments. Because of the geology of the Nevada deposits, a majority of the material produced is hard and dense, being of sufficient quality that no treatment or enhancement is required. While nearly every county in the state has yielded some turquoise, the chief producers are in Lander and Esmeralda counties. Most of the turquoise deposits in Nevada occur along a wide belt of tectonic activity that coincides with the state&#x27;s zone of thrust faulting. It strikes at a bearing of about 15° and extends from the northern part of Elko County, southward down to the California border southwest of Tonopah. Nevada has produced a wide diversity of colours and mixes of different matrix patterns, with turquoise from Nevada coming in various shades of blue, blue-green, and green. Some of this unusually-coloured turquoise may contain significant zinc and iron, which is the cause of the beautiful bright green to yellow-green shades. Some of the green to green-yellow shades may actually be variscite or faustite, which are secondary phosphate minerals similar in appearance to turquoise. A significant portion of the Nevada material is also noted for its often attractive brown or black limonite veining, producing what is called &quot;spiderweb matrix&quot;. While a number of the Nevada deposits were first worked by Native Americans, the total Nevada turquoise production since the 1870s has been estimated at more than , including nearly from the Carico Lake mine. In spite of increased costs, small scale mining operations continue at a number of turquoise properties in Nevada, including the Godber, Orvil Jack and Carico Lake mines in Lander County, the Pilot Mountain Mine in Mineral County, and several properties in the Royston and Candelaria areas of Esmerelda County.

In 1912, the first deposit of distinct, single-crystal turquoise was discovered at Lynch Station in Campbell County, Virginia. The crystals, forming a druse over the mother rock, are very small; is considered large. Until the 1980s Virginia was widely thought to be the only source of distinct crystals; there are now at least 27 other localities.

In an attempt to recoup profits and meet demand, some American turquoise is treated or &quot;enhanced&quot; to a certain degree. These treatments include innocuous waxing and more controversial procedures, such as dyeing and impregnation (see Treatments). There are some American mines which produce materials of high enough quality that no treatment or alterations are required. Any such treatments which have been performed should be disclosed to the buyer on sale of the material.

=== Other sources ===
Turquoise prehistoric artifacts (beads) are known since the fifth millennium BCE from sites in the Eastern Rhodopes in Bulgaria – the source for the raw material is possibly related to the nearby Spahievo lead–zinc ore field. In Spain, turquoise has been found as a minor mineral in the variscite deposits exploited during prehistoric times in Palazuelos de las Cuevas (Zamora) and in Can Tintorer, Gavá (Barcelona).

China has been a minor source of turquoise for 3,000 years or more. Gem-quality material, in the form of compact nodules, is found in the fractured, silicified limestone of Yunxian and Zhushan, Hubei province. Additionally, Marco Polo reported turquoise found in present-day Sichuan. Most Chinese material is exported, but a few carvings worked in a manner similar to jade exist. In Tibet, gem-quality deposits purportedly exist in the mountains of Derge and Nagari-Khorsum in the east and west of the region respectively.

Other notable localities include: Afghanistan; Australia (Victoria and Queensland); north India; northern Chile (Chuquicamata); Cornwall; Saxony; Silesia; and Turkestan.

== History of use ==


The pastel shades of turquoise have endeared it to many great cultures of antiquity: it has adorned the rulers of Ancient Egypt, the Aztecs (and possibly other Pre-Columbian Mesoamericans), Persia, Mesopotamia, the Indus Valley, and to some extent in ancient China since at least the Shang dynasty. Despite being one of the oldest gems, probably first introduced to Europe (through Turkey) with other Silk Road novelties, turquoise did not become important as an ornamental stone in the West until the 14th century, following a decline in the Roman Catholic Church&#x27;s influence which allowed the use of turquoise in secular jewellery. It was apparently unknown in India until the Mughal period, and unknown in Japan until the 18th century. A common belief shared by many of these civilizations held that turquoise possessed certain prophylactic qualities; it was thought to change colour with the wearer&#x27;s health and protect him or her from untoward forces.

The Aztecs viewed turquoise as an embodiment of fire and gave it properties such as heat and smokiness. They inlaid turquoise, together with gold, quartz, malachite, jet, jade, coral, and shells, into provocative (and presumably ceremonial) mosaic objects such as masks (some with a human skull as their base), knives, and shields. Natural resins, bitumen and wax were used to bond the turquoise to the objects&#x27; base material; this was usually wood, but bone and shell were also used. Like the Aztecs, the Pueblo, Navajo and Apache tribes cherished turquoise for its amuletic use; the latter tribe believe the stone to afford the archer dead aim. In Navajo culture it is used for &quot;a spiritual protection and blessing.&quot; Among these peoples turquoise was used in mosaic inlay, in sculptural works, and was fashioned into toroidal beads and freeform pendants. The Ancestral Puebloans (Anasazi) of the Chaco Canyon and surrounding region are believed to have prospered greatly from their production and trading of turquoise objects. The distinctive silver jewellery produced by the Navajo and other Southwestern Native American tribes today is a rather modern development, thought to date from around 1880 as a result of European influences.

In Persia, turquoise was the &quot;de facto&quot; national stone for millennia, extensively used to decorate objects (from turbans to bridles), mosques, and other important buildings both inside and out, such as the Medresseh-i Shah Husein Mosque of Isfahan. The Persian style and use of turquoise was later brought to India following the establishment of the Mughal Empire there, its influence seen in high purity gold jewellery (together with ruby and diamond) and in such buildings as the Taj Mahal. Persian turquoise was often engraved with devotional words in Arabic script which was then inlaid with gold.

Cabochons of imported turquoise, along with coral, was (and still is) used extensively in the silver and gold jewellery of Tibet and Mongolia, where a greener hue is said to be preferred. Most of the pieces made today, with turquoise usually roughly polished into irregular cabochons set simply in silver, are meant for inexpensive export to Western markets and are probably not accurate representations of the original style.

The Ancient Egyptian use of turquoise stretches back as far as the First Dynasty and possibly earlier; however, probably the most well-known pieces incorporating the gem are those recovered from Tutankhamun&#x27;s tomb, most notably the Pharaoh&#x27;s iconic burial mask which was liberally inlaid with the stone. It also adorned rings and great sweeping necklaces called &quot;pectorals&quot;. Set in gold, the gem was fashioned into beads, used as inlay, and often carved in a scarab motif, accompanied by carnelian, lapis lazuli, and in later pieces, coloured glass. Turquoise, associated with the goddess Hathor, was so liked by the Ancient Egyptians that it became (arguably) the first gemstone to be imitated, the fair structure created by an artificial glazed ceramic product known as faience.

The French conducted archaeological excavations of Egypt from the mid-19th century through the early 20th. These excavations, including that of Tutankhamun&#x27;s tomb, created great public interest in the western world, subsequently influencing jewellery, architecture, and art of the time. Turquoise, already favoured for its pastel shades since around 1810, was a staple of Egyptian Revival pieces. In contemporary Western use, turquoise is most often encountered cut &quot;en cabochon&quot; in silver rings, bracelets, often in the Native American style, or as tumbled or roughly hewn beads in chunky necklaces. Lesser material may be carved into fetishes, such as those crafted by the Zuni. While strong sky blues remain superior in value, mottled green and yellowish material is popular with artisans.

== Cultural associations ==
In many cultures of the Old and New Worlds, this gemstone has been esteemed for thousands of years as a holy stone, a bringer of good fortune or a talisman. The oldest evidence for this claim was found in Ancient Egypt, where grave furnishings with turquoise inlay were discovered, dating from approximately 3000 BCE. In the ancient Persian Empire, the sky-blue gemstones were earlier worn round the neck or wrist as protection against unnatural death. If they changed colour, the wearer was thought to have reason to fear the approach of doom. Meanwhile, it has been discovered that the turquoise certainly can change colour, but that this is not necessarily a sign of impending danger. The change can be caused by the light, or by a chemical reaction brought about by cosmetics, dust or the acidity of the skin.

The goddess Hathor was associated with turquoise, as she was the patroness of Serabit el-Khadim, where it was mined. Her titles included &quot;Lady of Turquoise&quot;, &quot;Mistress of Turquoise&quot;, and &quot;Lady of Turquoise Country&quot;.

In Western culture, turquoise is also the traditional birthstone for those born in the month of December. The turquoise is also a stone in the Jewish High Priest&#x27;s breastplate, described in Exodus chapter 28. The stone is also considered sacred to the indigenous Zuni and Pueblo peoples of the American Southwest. The pre-Columbian Aztec and Maya also considered it to be a valuable and culturally important stone.

== Imitations ==

The Egyptians were the first to produce an artificial imitation of turquoise, in the glazed earthenware product faience. Later glass and enamel were also used, and in modern times more sophisticated porcelain, plastics, and various assembled, pressed, bonded, and sintered products (composed of various copper and aluminium compounds) have been developed: examples of the latter include &quot;Viennese turquoise&quot;, made from precipitated aluminium phosphate coloured by copper oleate; and &quot;neolith&quot;, a mixture of bayerite and copper(II) phosphate. Most of these products differ markedly from natural turquoise in both physical and chemical properties, but in 1972 Pierre Gilson introduced one fairly close to a true synthetic (it does differ in chemical composition owing to a binder used, meaning it is best described as a simulant rather than a synthetic). Gilson turquoise is made in both a uniform colour and with black &quot;spiderweb matrix&quot; veining not unlike the natural Nevada material.

The most common imitation of turquoise encountered today is dyed howlite and magnesite, both white in their natural states, and the former also having natural (and convincing) black veining similar to that of turquoise. Dyed chalcedony, jasper, and marble is less common, and much less convincing. Other natural materials occasionally confused with or used in lieu of turquoise include: variscite and faustite; chrysocolla (especially when impregnating quartz); lazulite; smithsonite; hemimorphite; wardite; and a fossil bone or tooth called odontolite or &quot;bone turquoise&quot;, coloured blue naturally by the mineral vivianite. While rarely encountered today, odontolite was once mined in large quantities—specifically for its use as a substitute for turquoise—in southern France.

These fakes are detected by gemologists using a number of tests, relying primarily on non-destructive, close examination of surface structure under magnification; a featureless, pale blue background peppered by flecks or spots of whitish material is the typical surface appearance of natural turquoise, while manufactured imitations will appear radically different in both colour (usually a uniform dark blue) and texture (usually granular or sugary). Glass and plastic will have a much greater translucency, with bubbles or flow lines often visible just below the surface. Staining between grain boundaries may be visible in dyed imitations.

Some destructive tests may be necessary; for example, the application of diluted hydrochloric acid will cause the carbonates odontolite and magnesite to effervesce and howlite to turn green, while a heated probe may give rise to the pungent smell so indicative of plastic. Differences in specific gravity, refractive index, light absorption (as evident in a material&#x27;s absorption spectrum), and other physical and optical properties are also considered as means of separation.

== Treatments ==
Turquoise is treated to enhance both its colour and durability (increased hardness and decreased porosity). As is so often the case with any precious stones, full disclosure about treatment is frequently not given. Gemologists can detect these treatments using a variety of testing methods, some of which are destructive, such as the use of a heated probe applied to an inconspicuous spot, which will reveal oil, wax or plastic treatment.

=== Waxing and oiling ===
Historically, light waxing and oiling were the first treatments used in ancient times, providing a wetting effect, thereby enhancing the colour and lustre. This treatment is more or less acceptable by tradition, especially because treated turquoise is usually of a higher grade to begin with. Oiled and waxed stones are prone to &quot;sweating&quot; under even gentle heat or if exposed to too much sun, and they may develop a white surface film or bloom over time. (With some skill, oil and wax treatments can be restored.)

=== Backing ===
Since finer turquoise is often found as thin seams, it may be glued to a base of stronger foreign material for reinforcement. These stones are termed &quot;backed&quot;, and it is standard practice that all thinly cut turquoise in the Southwestern United States is backed. Native indigenous peoples of this region, because of their considerable use and wearing of turquoise, have found that backing increases the durability of thinly cut slabs and cabochons of turquoise. They observe that if the stone is not backed it will often crack. Backing of turquoise is not widely known outside of the Native American and Southwestern United States jewellery trade. Backing does not diminish the value of high quality turquoise, and indeed the process is expected for most thinly cut American commercial gemstones.

=== Zachery treatment===
A proprietary process was created by electrical engineer and turquoise dealer James E. Zachery in the 1980s to improve the stability of medium to high-grade turquoise. The process can be applied in several ways: either through deep penetration on rough turquoise to decrease porosity, by shallow treatment of finished turquoise to enhance color, or both. The treatment can enhance color and improve the turquoise&#x27;s ability to take a polish. Such treated turquoise can be distinguished in some cases from natural turquoise, without destruction, by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, which can detect its elevated potassium levels. In some instances, such as with already high-quality, low-porosity turquoise that is treated only for porosity, the treatment is undetectable.

=== Dyeing ===
The use of Prussian blue and other dyes (often in conjunction with bonding treatments) to &quot;enhance” its appearance, make uniform or completely change the colour, is regarded as fraudulent by some purists, especially since some dyes may fade or rub off on the wearer. Dyes have also been used to darken the veins of turquoise.

=== Stabilization ===
Material treated with plastic or water glass is termed &quot;bonded&quot; or &quot;stabilized&quot; turquoise. This process consists of pressure impregnation of otherwise unsaleable chalky American material by epoxy and plastics (such as polystyrene) and water glass (sodium silicate) to produce a wetting effect and improve durability. Plastic and water glass treatments are far more permanent and stable than waxing and oiling, and can be applied to material too chemically or physically unstable for oil or wax to provide sufficient improvement. Conversely, stabilization and bonding are rejected by some as too radical an alteration.

The epoxy binding technique was first developed in the 1950s and has been attributed to Colbaugh Processing of Arizona, a company that still operates today.

=== Reconstitution ===
Perhaps the most extreme of treatments is &quot;reconstitution&quot;, wherein fragments of fine turquoise material, too small to be used individually, are powdered and then bonded with resin to form a solid mass. Very often the material sold as &quot;reconstituted turquoise&quot; is artificial, with little or no natural stone, made entirely from resins and dyes. In the trade reconstituted turquoise is often called &quot;block turquoise&quot; or simply &quot;block&quot;.

== Valuation and care ==
Hardness and richness of colour are two of the major factors in determining the value of turquoise; while colour is a matter of individual taste, generally speaking, the most desirable is a strong sky to robin egg blue (in reference to the eggs of the American robin). Whatever the colour, for many applications, turquoise should not be soft or chalky; even if treated, such lesser material (to which most turquoise belongs) is liable to fade or discolour over time and will not hold up to normal use in jewellery.

The mother rock or &quot;matrix&quot; in which turquoise is found can often be seen as splotches or a network of brown or black veins running through the stone in a netted pattern; this veining may add value to the stone if the result is complementary, but such a result is uncommon. Such material is sometimes described as &quot;spiderweb matrix&quot;; it is most valued in the Southwest United States and Far East, but is not highly appreciated in the Near East where unblemished and vein-free material is ideal (regardless of how complementary the veining may be). Uniformity of colour is desired, and in finished pieces the quality of workmanship is also a factor; this includes the quality of the polish and the symmetry of the stone. Calibrated stones—that is, stones adhering to standard jewellery setting measurements—may also be more sought after. Like coral and other opaque gems, turquoise is commonly sold at a price according to its physical size in millimetres rather than weight.

Turquoise is treated in many different ways, some more permanent and radical than others. Controversy exists as to whether some of these treatments should be acceptable, but one can be more or less forgiven universally: This is the &quot;light&quot; waxing or oiling applied to most gem turquoise to improve its colour and lustre; if the material is of high quality to begin with, very little of the wax or oil is absorbed and the turquoise therefore does not rely on this impermanent treatment for its beauty. All other factors being equal, untreated turquoise will always command a higher price. Bonded and reconstituted material is worth considerably less.

Being a phosphate mineral, turquoise is inherently fragile and sensitive to solvents; perfume and other cosmetics will attack the finish and may alter the colour of turquoise gems, as will skin oils, as will most commercial jewellery cleaning fluids. Prolonged exposure to direct sunlight may also discolour or dehydrate turquoise. Care should therefore be taken when wearing such jewels: cosmetics, including sunscreen and hair spray, should be applied before putting on turquoise jewellery, and they should not be worn to a beach or other sun-bathed environment. After use, turquoise should be gently cleaned with a soft cloth to avoid a buildup of residue, and should be stored in its own container to avoid scratching by harder gems. Turquoise can also be adversely affected if stored in an airtight container.

<text>A mirage is a naturally-occurring optical phenomenon in which light rays bend via refraction to produce a displaced image of distant objects or the sky. The word comes to English via the French &quot;(se) mirer&quot;, from the Latin &quot;mirari&quot;, meaning &quot;to look at, to wonder at&quot;.

Mirages can be categorized as &quot;inferior&quot; (meaning lower), &quot;superior&quot; (meaning higher) and &quot;Fata Morgana&quot;, one kind of superior mirage consisting of a series of unusually elaborate, vertically stacked images, which form one rapidly-changing mirage.

In contrast to a hallucination, a mirage is a real optical phenomenon that can be captured on camera, since light rays are actually refracted to form the false image at the observer&#x27;s location. What the image appears to represent, however, is determined by the interpretive faculties of the human mind. For example, inferior images on land are very easily mistaken for the reflections from a small body of water.
==Inferior mirage==

In an inferior mirage, the mirage image appears below the real object. The real object in an inferior mirage is the (blue) sky or any distant (therefore bluish) object in that same direction. The mirage causes the observer to see a bright and bluish patch on the ground.

Light rays coming from a particular distant object all travel through nearly the same layers of air, and all are refracted at about the same angle. Therefore, rays coming from the top of the object will arrive lower than those from the bottom. The image is usually upside-down, enhancing the illusion that the sky image seen in the distance is a specular reflection on a puddle of water or oil acting as a mirror.

While the aero-dynamics are highly active, the image of the inferior mirage is stable unlike the fata morgana which can change within seconds. Since warmer air rises while cooler air (being denser) sinks, the layers will mix, causing turbulence. The image will be distorted accordingly; it may vibrate or be stretched vertically (towering) or compressed vertically (stooping). A combination of vibration and extension are also possible. If several temperature layers are present, several mirages may mix, perhaps causing double images. In any case, mirages are usually not larger than about half a degree high (roughly the angular diameter of the Sun and Moon) and are from objects between dozens of meters and a few kilometers away.


===Heat haze===

&quot;Heat haze&quot;, also called &quot;heat shimmer&quot;, refers to the inferior mirage observed when viewing objects through a mass of heated air. Common instances when heat haze occurs include images of objects viewed across asphalt concrete (also known as tarmac), roads and over masonry rooftops on hot days, above and behind fire (as in burning candles, patio heaters, and campfires), and through exhaust gases from jet engines. When appearing on roads due to the hot asphalt, it is often referred to as a &quot;highway mirage&quot;. It also occurs in deserts; in that case, it is referred to as a &quot;desert mirage&quot;. Both tarmac and sand can become very hot when exposed to the sun, easily being more than higher than the air above, enough to make conditions suitable to cause the mirage.

Convection causes the temperature of the air to vary, and the variation between the hot air at the surface of the road and the denser cool air above it causes a gradient in the refractive index of the air. This produces a blurred shimmering effect, which hinders the ability to resolve the image and increases when the image is magnified through a telescope or telephoto lens.

Light from the sky at a shallow angle to the road is refracted by the index gradient, making it appear as if the sky is reflected by the road&#x27;s surface. This might appear as a pool of liquid (usually water, but possibly others, such as oil) on the road, as some types of liquid also reflect the sky. The illusion moves into the distance as the observer approaches the miraged object giving one the same effect as approaching a rainbow.

Heat haze is not related to the atmospheric phenomenon of haze.
==Superior mirage==


A superior mirage is one in which the mirage image appears to be located above the real object. A superior mirage occurs when the air below the line of sight is colder than the air above it. This unusual arrangement is called a temperature inversion. During the daytime, the normal temperature gradient of the atmosphere is cold air above warm air. Passing through the temperature inversion, the light rays are bent down, and so the image appears above the true object, hence the name &quot;superior&quot;. 

Superior mirages are quite common in polar regions, especially over large sheets of ice that have a uniform low temperature. Superior mirages also occur at more moderate latitudes; however, in those cases, they are weaker and tend to be less smooth and stable. For example, a distant shoreline may appear to &quot;tower&quot; and look higher (and, thus, perhaps closer) than it really is. Because of the turbulence, there appear to be dancing spikes and towers. This type of mirage is also called the Fata Morgana, or &quot;hafgerðingar&quot; in the Icelandic language.

A superior mirage can be right-side up or upside-down, depending on the distance of the true object and the temperature gradient. Often, the image appears as a distorted mixture of up and down parts.

Since the earth is round, if the downward bending curvature of light rays is about the same as the curvature of Earth, light rays can travel large distances, including from beyond the horizon. This was observed and documented in 1596, when a ship in search of the Northeast passage became stuck in the ice at Novaya Zemlya, above the Arctic Circle. The Sun appeared to rise two weeks earlier than expected; the real Sun was still visible below the horizon, but its light rays followed the curvature of Earth. This effect is often called a Novaya Zemlya mirage. For every that light rays travel parallel to Earth&#x27;s surface, the Sun will appear 1° higher on the horizon. The inversion layer must have just the right temperature gradient over the whole distance to make this possible.

In the same way, ships that are so far away that they should not be visible above the geometric horizon may appear on or even above the horizon as superior mirages. This may explain some stories about flying ships or coastal cities in the sky, as described by some polar explorers. These are examples of so-called Arctic mirages, or &quot;hillingar&quot; in Icelandic.

If the vertical temperature gradient is + per (where the positive sign means the temperature increases at higher altitudes) then horizontal light rays will just follow the curvature of Earth, and the horizon will appear flat. If the gradient is less (as it almost always is), the rays are not bent enough and get lost in space, which is the normal situation of a spherical, convex &quot;horizon&quot;.

In some situations, distant objects can be elevated or lowered, stretched or shortened with no mirage involved.

===Fata Morgana===

A &quot;Fata Morgana&quot; (the name comes from the Italian translation of Morgan le Fay, the fairy, shapeshifting half-sister of King Arthur) is a very complex superior mirage. It appears with alternations of compressed and stretched areas, erect images, and inverted images. A Fata Morgana is also a fast-changing mirage.

Fata Morgana mirages are most common in polar regions, especially over large sheets of ice with a uniform low temperature, but they can be observed almost anywhere. In polar regions, a Fata Morgana may be observed on cold days; in desert areas and over oceans and lakes, a Fata Morgana may be observed on hot days. For a Fata Morgana, temperature inversion has to be strong enough that light rays&#x27; curvatures within the inversion are stronger than the curvature of Earth.

The rays will bend and form arcs. An observer needs to be within an atmospheric duct to be able to see a Fata Morgana.
Fata Morgana mirages may be observed from any altitude within Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, including from mountaintops or airplanes.

Distortions of image and bending of light can produce spectacular effects. In his book &quot;Pursuit: The Chase and Sinking of the &quot;Bismarck&quot;&quot;, Ludovic Kennedy describes an incident that allegedly took place below the Denmark Strait during 1941, following the sinking of the &quot;Hood&quot;. The &quot;Bismarck&quot;, while pursued by the British cruisers &quot;Norfolk&quot; and &quot;Suffolk&quot;, passed out of sight into a sea mist. Within a matter of seconds, the ship re-appeared, steaming toward the British ships at high speed. In alarm, the cruisers separated, anticipating an imminent attack, and observers from both ships watched in astonishment as the German battleship fluttered, grew indistinct, and faded away. Radar watch during these events indicated that the &quot;Bismarck&quot; had, in fact, made no change to her course.
==Night-time mirages==
The conditions for producing a mirage can occur at night as well as during the day. Under some circumstances mirages of astronomical objects and mirages of lights from moving vehicles, aircraft, ships, buildings, etc. can be observed at night.

===Mirage of astronomical objects===

A mirage of an astronomical object is a naturally occurring optical phenomenon in which light rays are bent to produce distorted or multiple images of an astronomical object. Mirages can be observed for such astronomical objects as the Sun, the Moon, the planets, bright stars, and very bright comets. The most commonly observed are sunset and sunrise mirages.

<text>Parenting or child rearing promotes and supports the physical, cognitive, social, emotional, and educational development from infancy to adulthood. Parenting refers to the intricacies of raising a child and not exclusively for a biological relationship.

The most common caretakers in parenting are the biological parents of the child in question. However, a caretaker may be an older sibling, step-parent, grandparent, legal guardian, aunt, uncle, other family members, or a family friend. Governments and society may also have a role in child-rearing or upbringing. In many cases, orphaned or abandoned children receive parental care from non-parent or non-blood relations. Others may be adopted, raised in foster care, or placed in an orphanage. Parenting skills vary, and a parent or surrogate with good parenting skills may be referred to as a &quot;good parent&quot;.

Parenting styles vary by historical period, racial and ethnic backgrounds, social class, personal preferences, and other social factors. 
There is no single &#x27;correct&#x27; parenting style for raising a child. Circumstances and experiences influence which styles are most appropriate. This presumes that parenting styles are not premised on a one size fits all principle.
Additionally, research supports that parental history, both in terms of attachments of varying quality and parental psychopathology, particularly in the wake of adverse experiences, can strongly influence parental sensitivity and child outcomes. Parenting may have long-term impacts on adoptive children as well, as recent research has shown that warm adoptive parenting reduces internalizing and externalizing problems of the adoptive children over time.

==Factors that affect decisions==
Social class, wealth, culture and income have a very strong impact on what methods of child rearing parents use. Cultural values play a major role in how a parent raises their child. However, parenting is always evolving, as times, cultural practices, social norms, and traditions change. Studies on these factors affecting parenting decisions have shown just that.

In psychology, the parental investment theory suggests that basic differences between males and females in parental investment have great adaptive significance and lead to gender differences in mating propensities and preferences.

==Styles==

A parenting style is indicative of the overall emotional climate in the home. Developmental psychologist Diana Baumrind proposed three main parenting styles in early child development: authoritative, authoritarian, and permissive. These parenting styles were later expanded to four to include an uninvolved style. These four styles involve combinations of acceptance and responsiveness, and also involve demand and control. Research has found that parenting style is significantly related to a child&#x27;s subsequent mental health and well-being. In particular, authoritative parenting is positively related to mental health and satisfaction with life, and authoritarian parenting is negatively related to these variables. With authoritarian and permissive parenting on opposite sides of the spectrum, most conventional modern models of parenting fall somewhere in between. Although it is influential, Baumrind&#x27;s typology has received significant criticism for containing overly broad categorizations and an imprecise and overly idealized description of authoritative parenting.
===Authoritative parenting===
Described by Baumrind as the &quot;just right&quot; style, it combines medium level demands on the child and a medium level responsiveness from the parents. Authoritative parents rely on positive reinforcement and infrequent use of punishment. Parents are more aware of a child&#x27;s feelings and capabilities and support the development of a child&#x27;s autonomy within reasonable limits. There is a give-and-take atmosphere involved in parent-child communication, and both control and support are balanced. Some research has shown that this style of parenting is more beneficial than the too-hard authoritarian style or the too-soft permissive style. These children score higher in terms of competence, mental health, and social development than those raised in permissive, authoritarian, or neglectful homes. However, Dr. Wendy Grolnick has critiqued Baumrind&#x27;s use of the term &quot;firm control&quot; in her description of authoritative parenting and argued that there should be clear differentiation between coercive power assertion (which is associated with negative effects on children) and the more positive practices of structure and high expectations.

===Authoritarian parenting===
Authoritarian parents are very rigid and strict. High demands are placed on the child, but there is little responsiveness to them. Parents who practice authoritarian-style parenting have a non-negotiable set of rules and expectations strictly enforced and require rigid obedience. When the rules are not followed, punishment is often used to promote and ensure future compliance. There is usually no explanation of punishment except that the child is in trouble for breaking a rule. This parenting style is strongly associated with corporal punishment, such as spanking. This type of parenting seems to be seen more often in working-class families than in the middle class. In 1983, Diana Baumrind found that children raised in an authoritarian-style home were less cheerful, moodier, and more vulnerable to stress. In many cases, these children also demonstrated passive hostility. This parenting style can negatively impact the educational success and career path, while a firm and reassuring parenting style impact positively.

===Permissive parenting===
Permissive parenting has become a more popular parenting method for middle-class families than working-class families roughly since the end of WWII. In these settings, a child&#x27;s freedom and autonomy are highly valued, and parents rely primarily on reasoning and explanation. Parents are undemanding, and thus there tends to be little if any punishment or explicit rules in this parenting style. These parents say that their children are free from external constraints and tend to be highly responsive to whatever it is that the child wants. Children of permissive parents are generally happy but sometimes show low levels of self-control and self-reliance because they lack structure at home. Author Alfie Kohn criticized the study and categorization of permissive parenting, arguing that it serves to &quot;blur the differences between &#x27;permissive&#x27; parents who were really just confused and those who were deliberately democratic.&quot;

===Uninvolved parenting===
An uninvolved or neglectful parenting style is when parents are often emotionally or physically absent. They have little to no expectations from the child and regularly have no communication. They are not responsive to a child&#x27;s needs and have little to no behavioral expectations. They may consider their children to be &quot;emotionally priceless&quot; and may not engage with them and believe they are giving the child its personal space. If present, they may provide what the child needs for survival with little to no engagement. There is often a large gap between parents and children with this parenting style. Children with little or no communication with their own parents tend to be victimized by other children and may exhibit deviant behavior themselves. Children of uninvolved parents suffer in social competence, academic performance, psychosocial development, and problematic behavior.

===Intrusive parenting===
Intrusive parenting is when parents use &quot;parental control and inhibition of adolescents&#x27; thoughts, feelings, and emotional expression through the use of love withdrawal, guilt induction, and manipulative tactics&quot; for protecting them from the possible pitfalls, without knowing it can deprive/disturb the adolescents&#x27; development and growth period. Intrusive parents may try to set unrealistic expectations on their children by overestimating their intellectual capability and underestimating their physical capability or developmental capability, like enrolling them into more extracurricular activities or enrolling them into certain classes without understanding their child&#x27;s passion, and it may eventually lead children not taking ownership of activities or develop behavioral problems. Children, especially adolescents might become victims and be &quot;unassertive, avoid confrontation, being eager to please others, and suffer from low self-esteem.&quot; They may compare their children to others, like friends and family, and also force their child to be codependent—to a point where the children feel unprepared when they go into the world. Research has shown that this parenting style can lead to &quot;greater under-eating behaviors, risky cyber behaviors, substance use, and depressive symptoms among adolescents.&quot;

===Unconditional parenting===
Unconditional parenting refers to a parenting approach that is focused on the whole child, emphasizes working with a child to solve problems, and views parental love as a gift. It contrasts with conditional parenting, which focuses on the child&#x27;s behavior, emphasizes controlling children using rewards and punishments, and views parental love as a privilege to be earned. The concept of unconditional parenting was popularized by author Alfie Kohn in his 2005 book &quot;Unconditional Parenting: Moving from Rewards and Punishments to Love and Reason&quot;. Kohn differentiates unconditional parenting from what he sees as the caricature of permissive parenting by arguing that parents can be anti-authoritarian and opposed to exerting control while also recognizing the value of respectful adult guidance and a child&#x27;s need for non-coercive structure in their lives.

===Trustful parenting===
Trustful parenting is a child-centered parenting style in which parents trust their children to make decisions, play and explore on their own, and learn from their own mistakes. Research professor Peter Gray argues that trustful parenting was the dominant parenting style in prehistoric hunter-gatherer societies. Gray contrasts trustful parenting with &quot;directive-domineering&quot; parenting, which emphasizes controlling children to train them in obedience (historically involving using child labor to teach subservience to lords and masters), and &quot;directive-protective&quot; parenting, which involves controlling children to protect them from harm. Gray argues that the directive-domineering approach became the predominant parenting style with the spread of agriculture and industry, while the directive-protective approach took over as the dominant approach in the late 20th century.

==Practices==
A parenting practice is a specific behavior that a parent uses in raising a child. These practices are used to socialize children. Kuppens et al. found that &quot;researchers have identified overarching parenting dimensions that reflect similar parenting practices, mostly by modeling the relationships among these parenting practices using factor analytic techniques.&quot; For example, many parents read aloud to their offspring in the hopes of supporting their linguistic and intellectual development. In cultures with strong oral traditions, such as Indigenous American communities and New Zealand Maori communities, storytelling is a critical parenting practice for children.

Parenting practices reflect the cultural understanding of children. Parents in individualistic countries like Germany spend more time engaged in face-to-face interaction with babies and more time talking to the baby about the baby. Parents in more communal cultures, such as West African cultures, spend more time talking to the baby about other people and more time with the baby facing outwards so that the baby sees what the mother sees.

===Skills and behaviors===
Parenting skills and behaviors assist parents in leading children into healthy adulthood and development of the child&#x27;s social skills. The cognitive potential, social skills, and behavioral functioning a child acquires during the early years are positively correlated with the quality of their interactions with their parents.

According to the Canadian Council on Learning, children benefit (or avoid poor developmental outcomes) when their parents:
# Communicate truthfully about events: Authenticity from parents who explain can help their children understand what happened and how they are involved;
# Maintain consistency: Parents that regularly institute routines can see benefits in their children&#x27;s behavioral patterns;
# Utilize resources available to them, reaching out into the community and building a supportive social network;
# Take an interest in their child&#x27;s educational and early developmental needs (e.g., Play that enhances socialization, autonomy, cohesion, calmness, and trust.); and
# Keep open communication lines about what their child is seeing, learning, and doing, and how those things are affecting them.

Parenting skills are widely thought to be naturally present in parents; however, there is substantial evidence to the contrary. Those who come from a negative or vulnerable childhood environment frequently (and often unintentionally) mimic their parents&#x27; behavior during interactions with their own children. Parents with an inadequate understanding of developmental milestones may also demonstrate problematic parenting. Parenting practices are of particular importance during marital transitions like separation, divorce, and remarriage; if children fail to adequately adjust to these changes, they are at risk of negative outcomes (e.g. increased rule-breaking behavior, problems with peer relationships, and increased emotional difficulties).

Research classifies competence and skills required in parenting as follows:
* Parent-child relationship skills: quality time spent, positive communications, and delighted show of affection.
* Encouraging desirable behavior: praise and encouragement, nonverbal attention, facilitating engaging activities.
* Teaching skills and behaviors: being a good example, incidental teaching, human communication of the skill with role-playing and other methods, communicating logical incentives and consequences.
* Managing misbehavior: establishing firm ground rules and limits, directing discussion, providing clear and calm instructions, communicating and enforcing appropriate consequences, using restrictive tactics like quiet time and time out with an authoritative stance rather than an authoritarian one.
* Anticipating and planning: advanced planning and preparation for readying the child for challenges, finding out engaging and age-appropriate developmental activities, preparing the token economy for self-management practice with guidance, holding follow-up discussions, identifying possible negative developmental trajectories.
* Self-regulation skills: monitoring behaviors (own and children&#x27;s), setting developmentally appropriate goals, evaluating strengths and weaknesses and setting practice tasks, monitoring and preventing internalizing and externalizing behaviors.
* Mood and coping skills: reframing and discouraging unhelpful thoughts (diversions, goal orientation, and mindfulness), stress and tension management (own and children&#x27;s), developing personal coping statements and plans for high-risk situations, building mutual respect and consideration between members of the family through collaborative activities and rituals.
* Partner support skills: improving personal communication, giving and receiving constructive feedback and support, avoiding negative family interaction styles, supporting and finding hope in problems for adaptation, leading collaborative problem solving, promoting relationship happiness and cordiality.

Consistency is considered the &quot;backbone&quot; of positive parenting skills and &quot;overprotection&quot; the weakness.

The Arbinger Institute adds to these skills and methods of parenting with what the authors of The Parenting Pyramid claims are methods to &quot;parent for things to go right,&quot; or in other words steps that should be taken to ensure good positive relationships are occurring in the home which can help children be more willing to listen. Their methods are described as The Parenting Pyramid. The Parenting Pyramid starting at the foundational level and working up to the top:

# Ways of being
# Relationship with spouse
# Relationship with child
# Teaching
# and finally, Corrections

Believing that as parents are focused on this order of establishing their homes and parenting styles, then if a parent has to encourage different behaviors from children this correction will come from a better place and therefore the children may be more receptive to such feedback, compared to if a parent attempts to correct behaviors before focusing on the previous steps. 

=== Parent training ===
Parent psychosocial health can have a significant impact on the parent-child relationship. Group-based parent training and education programs have proven to be effective at improving short-term psychosocial well-being for parents. There are many different types of training parents can take to support their parenting skills. Some groups include Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT), Parents Management Training (PMT), Positive Parenting Program (Triple P), The Incredible Years, and Behavioral and Emotional Skills Training (BEST). PCIT works with both parents and children in teaching skills to interact more positively and productive. PMT is focused for children aged 3–13, in which parents are the main trainee. They are taught skills to help deal with challenging behaviors from their children. Triple P focus on equipping parents with the information they need to increase confidence and self-sufficiency in managing their children&#x27;s behavior. The Incredible Years focuses in age infancy-age 12, in which they are broken into small-group-based training in different areas. BEST introduces effective behavior management techniques in one day rather than over the course of a few weeks. Courses are offered to families based on effective training to support additional needs, behavioral guidelines, communication and many others to give guidance throughout learning how to be a parent.

===Cultural values===
Parents around the world want what they believe is best for their children. However, parents in different cultures have different ideas of what is best. For example, parents in hunter–gatherer societies or those who survive through subsistence agriculture are likely to promote practical survival skills from a young age. Many such cultures begin teaching children to use sharp tools, including knives, before their first birthdays. In some Indigenous American communities, child work provides children the opportunity to absorb cultural values of collaborative participation and prosocial behavior through observation and activity alongside adults. These communities value respect, participation, and non-interference, the Cherokee principle of respecting autonomy by withholding unsolicited advice. Indigenous American parents also try to encourage curiosity in their children via a permissive parenting style that enables them to explore and learn through observation of the world.

Differences in cultural values cause parents to interpret the same behaviors in different ways. For instance, European Americans prize intellectual understanding, especially in a narrow &quot;book learning&quot; sense, and believe that asking questions is a sign of intelligence. Italian parents value social and emotional competence and believe that curiosity demonstrates good interpersonal skills. Dutch parents, however, value independence, long attention spans, and predictability; in their eyes, asking questions is a negative behavior, signifying a lack of independence.

Even so, parents around the world share specific prosocial behavioral goals for their children. Hispanic parents value respect and emphasize putting family above the individual. Parents in East Asia prize order in the household above all else. In some cases, this gives rise to high levels of psychological control and even manipulation on the part of the head of the household. The Kipsigis people of Kenya value children who are innovative and wield that intelligence responsibly and helpfully—a behavior they call &quot;ng/om&quot;. Other cultures, such as in Sweden and Spain, value sociality and happiness as well.

====Indigenous American cultures====

It is common for parents in many Indigenous American communities to use different parenting tools such as storytelling —like myths— &quot;Consejos&quot; (Spanish for &quot;advice&quot;), educational teasing, nonverbal communication, and observational learning to teach their children important values and life lessons.

Storytelling is a way for Indigenous American children to learn about their identity, community, and cultural history. Indigenous myths and folklore often personify animals and objects, reaffirming the belief that everything possesses a soul and deserves respect. These stories also help preserve the language and are used to reflect certain values or cultural histories.

The &quot;Consejo&quot; is a narrative form of advice-giving. Rather than directly telling the child what to do in a particular situation, the parent might instead tell a story about a similar situation. The main character in the story is intended to help the child see their decision&#x27;s implications without directly deciding for them; this teaches the child to be decisive and independent while still providing some guidance.

The playful form of teasing is a parenting method used in some Indigenous American communities to keep children out of danger and guide their behavior. This parenting strategy uses stories, fabrications, or empty threats to guide children in making safe, intelligent decisions. For example, a parent may tell a child that there is a monster that jumps on children&#x27;s backs if they walk alone at night. This explanation can help keep the child safe because instilling that fear creates greater awareness and lessens the likelihood that they will wander alone into trouble.

In Navajo families, a child&#x27;s development is partly focused on the importance of &quot;respect&quot; for all things. &quot;Respect&quot; consists of recognizing the significance of one&#x27;s relationship with other things and people in the world. Children largely learn about this concept via nonverbal communication between parents and other family members. For example, children are initiated at an early age into the practice of an early morning run under any weather conditions. On this run, the community uses humor and laughter with each other, without directly including the child—who may not wish to get up early and run—to encourage the child to participate and become an active member of the community. Parents also promote participation in the morning runs by placing their child in the snow and having them stay longer if they protest.

Indigenous American parents often incorporate children into everyday life, including adult activities, allowing the child to learn through observation. This practice is known as LOPI, Learning by Observing and Pitching In, where children are integrated into all types of mature daily activities and encouraged to observe and contribute in the community. This inclusion as a parenting tool promotes both community participation and learning.

One notable example appears in some Mayan communities: young girls are not permitted around the hearth for an extended period of time, since corn is sacred. Although this is an exception to their cultural preference for incorporating children into activities, including cooking, it is a strong example of observational learning. Mayan girls can only watch their mothers making tortillas for a few minutes at a time, but the sacredness of the activity captures their interest. They will then go and practice their mother&#x27;s movements on other objects, such as kneading thin pieces of plastic like a tortilla. From this practice, when a girl comes of age, she is able to sit down and make tortillas without having ever received any explicit verbal instruction.

However, in many cases oppressive circumstances such as forced conversion, land loss, and displacement led to diminishment of traditional Native American parenting techniques.

==== Immigrants in the United States: Ethnic-racial socialization ====
Due to the increasing racial and ethnic diversity in the United States, ethnic-racial socialization research has gained some attention. Parental ethnic-racial socialization is a way of passing down cultural resources to support children of color&#x27;s psychosocial wellness. The goals of ethnic-racial socialization are: to pass on a positive view of one&#x27;s ethnic group and to help children cope with racism. Through a meta-analysis of published research on ethnic-racial socialization, ethnic-racial socialization positively affects psychosocial well-being. This meta-analytic review focuses on research relevant to four indicators of psychosocial skills and how they are influenced by developmental stage, race and ethnicity, research designs, and the differences between parent and child self-reports. The dimensions of ethnic-racial socialization that are considered when looking for correlations with psychosocial skills are cultural socialization, preparation for bias, promotion of mistrust, and egalitarianism.

Ethnic-racial socialization dimensions are defined as follows: cultural socialization is the process of passing down cultural customs, preparation for bias ranges from positive or negative reactions to racism and discrimination, promotion of mistrust conditions synergy when dealing with other races, and egalitarianism puts similarities between races first. Psychosocial competencies are defined as follows: self-perceptions involve perceived beliefs of academic and social capabilities, interpersonal relationships deal with the quality of relationships, externalizing behaviors deal with observable troublesome behavior, and internalizing behavior deals with emotional intelligence regulation. The multiple ways these domains and competencies interact show small correlations between ethnic-racial socialization and psychosocial wellness, but this parenting practice needs further research.

This meta-analysis showed that developmental stages affect how children perceived ethnic-racial socialization. Cultural socialization practices appear to affect children similarly across developmental stages except for preparation for bias and promotion of mistrust which are encouraged for older-aged children. Existing research shows ethnic-racial socialization serves African Americans positively against discrimination. Cross-sectional studies were predicted to have greater effect sizes because correlations are inflated in these kinds of studies. Parental reports of ethnic-racial socialization influence are influenced by &quot;intentions&quot;, so child reports tend to be more accurate.

Among other conclusions derived from this meta-analysis, cultural socialization and self-perceptions had a small positive correlation. Cultural socialization and promotion of mistrust had a small negative correlation, and interpersonal relationships positively impacted cultural socialization and preparation for bias. In regard to developmental stages, ethnic-racial socialization had a small but positive correlation with self-perceptions during childhood and early adolescence. Based on study designs, there were no significant differences, meaning that cross-sectional studies and longitudinal studies both showed small positive correlations between ethnic-racial socialization and self-perceptions. Reporter differences between parents and children showed positive correlations between ethnic-racial socialization when associated with internalizing behavior and interpersonal relationships. These two correlations showed a greater effect size with child reports compared to parent reports.

The meta-analysis on previous research shows only correlations, so there is a need for experimental studies that can show causation amongst the different domains and dimensions. Children&#x27;s behavior and adaptation to this behavior may indicate a bidirectional effect that can also be addressed by an experimental study. There is evidence to show that ethnic-racial socialization can help children of color obtain social-emotional skills that can help them navigate through racism and discrimination, but further research needs to be done to increase the generalizability of existing research.

==Across the lifespan==

===Pre-pregnancy===

Family planning is the decision-making process surrounding whether to become parents or not, and when the right time would be, including planning, preparing, and gathering resources. Prospective parents may assess (among other matters) whether they have access to sufficient financial resources, whether their family situation is stable, and whether they want to undertake the responsibility of raising a child. Worldwide, about 40% of all pregnancies are not planned, and more than 30 million babies are born each year as a result of unplanned pregnancies.

Reproductive health and preconception care affect pregnancy, reproductive success, and the physical and mental health of both mother and child. A woman who is underweight, whether due to poverty, eating disorders, or illness, is less likely to have a healthy pregnancy and give birth to a healthy baby than a woman who is healthy. Similarly, a woman who is obese has a higher risk of difficulties, including gestational diabetes. Other health problems, such as infections and iron-deficiency anemia, can be detected and corrected before conception.

===Pregnancy and prenatal parenting===

During pregnancy, the unborn child is affected by many decisions made by the parents, particularly choices linked to their lifestyle. The health, activity level, and nutrition available to the mother can affect the child&#x27;s development before birth. Some mothers, especially in relatively wealthy countries, overeat and spend too much time resting. Other mothers, especially if they are poor or abused, may be overworked and may not be able to eat enough, or may not be able to afford healthful foods with sufficient iron, vitamins, and protein, for the unborn child to develop properly.

===Newborns and infants===
Newborn parenting is where the responsibilities of parenthood begin. A newborn&#x27;s basic needs are food, sleep, comfort, and cleaning, which the parent provides. An infant&#x27;s only form of communication is crying, while there is some argument that infants have different types of cries for being hungry or in pain, that has largely been refuted. Newborns and young infants require feedings every few hours, which is disruptive to adult sleep cycles. They respond enthusiastically to soft stroking, cuddling, and caressing. Gentle rocking back and forth often calms a crying infant, as do massages and warm baths. Newborns may comfort themselves by sucking their thumb or by using a pacifier. The need to suckle is instinctive and allows newborns to feed. Breastfeeding is the recommended method of feeding by all major infant health organizations. If breastfeeding is not possible or desired, bottle feeding is a common alternative. Other alternatives include feeding breastmilk or formula with a cup, spoon, feeding syringe, or nursing supplement.

The forming of attachments is considered the foundation of the infant&#x27;s capacity to form and conduct relationships throughout life. Attachment is not the same as love or affection, although they often go together. Attachments develop immediately, and a lack of attachment or a seriously disrupted attachment has the potential to cause severe damage to a child&#x27;s health and well-being. Physically, one may not see symptoms or indications of a disorder, but the child may be affected emotionally. Studies show that children with secure attachments have the ability to form successful relationships, express themselves on an interpersonal basis, and have higher self-esteem. Conversely children who have neglectful or emotionally unavailable caregivers can exhibit behavioral problems such as post-traumatic stress disorder or oppositional defiant disorder. Oppositional-defiant disorder is a pattern of disobedient and rebellious behavior toward authority figures.

===Toddlers===

Toddlers are small children between 12 and 36 months old who are much more active than infants and become challenged with learning how to do simple tasks by themselves. At this stage, parents are heavily involved in showing the small child how to do things rather than just doing things for them; it is normal for the toddler to mimic the parents. Toddlers need help to build their vocabulary, increase their communication skills, and manage their emotions. Toddlers will also begin to understand social etiquette, such as being polite and taking turns.
Toddlers are very curious about the world around them and are eager to explore it. They seek greater independence and responsibility and may become frustrated when things do not go the way that they want or expect. Tantrums begin at this stage, which is sometimes referred to as the &#x27;Terrible Twos&#x27;. Tantrums are often caused by the child&#x27;s frustration over the particular situation, and are sometimes caused, simply because they are not able to communicate properly. Parents of toddlers are expected to help guide and teach the child, establish basic routines (such as washing hands before meals or brushing teeth before bed), and increase the child&#x27;s responsibilities. It is also normal for toddlers to be frequently frustrated. It is an essential step to their development. They will learn through experience, trial, and error. This means that they need to experience being frustrated when something does not work for them in order to move on to the next stage. When the toddler is frustrated, they will often misbehave with actions like screaming, hitting or biting. Parents need to be careful when reacting to such behaviors; giving threats or punishments is usually not helpful and might only make the situation worse. Research groups led by Daniel Schechter, Alytia Levendosky, and others have shown that parents with histories of maltreatment and violence exposure often have difficulty helping their toddlers and preschool-age children with the very same emotionally dysregulated behaviors which can remind traumatized parents of their adverse experiences and associated mental states.

Regarding gender differences in parenting, data from the US in 2014 states that, on an average day, among adults living in households with children under age 6, women spent 1.0 hours providing physical care (such as bathing or feeding a child) to household children. By contrast, men spent 23 minutes providing physical care.

===Child===
Younger children start to become more independent and begin to build friendships. They are able to reason and can make their own decisions in many hypothetical situations. Young children demand constant attention but gradually learn how to deal with boredom and begin to be able to play independently. They enjoy helping and also feeling useful and capable. Parents can assist their children by encouraging social interactions and modeling proper social behaviors. A large part of learning in the early years comes from being involved in activities and household duties. Parents who observe their children in play or join with them in child-driven play have the opportunity to glimpse into their children&#x27;s world, learn to communicate more effectively with their children, and are given another setting to offer gentle, nurturing guidance. Parents also teach their children health, hygiene, and eating habits through instruction and by example.

Parents are expected to make decisions about their child&#x27;s education. Parenting styles in this area diverge greatly at this stage, with some parents they choose to become heavily involved in arranging organized activities and early learning programs. Other parents choose to let the child develop with few organized activities.

Children begin to learn responsibility and consequences for their actions with parental assistance. Some parents provide a small allowance that increases with age to help teach children the value of money and how to be responsible.

Parents who are consistent and fair with their discipline, who openly communicate and offer explanations to their children, and who do not neglect the needs of their children in any way often find they have fewer problems with their children as they mature.

When child conduct problems are encountered, behavioral and cognitive-behavioral group-based parenting interventions have been found to be effective at improving child conduct, parenting skills, and parental mental health.

===Adolescents===

Parents often feel isolated and alone when parenting adolescents. Adolescence can be a time of high risk for children, where newfound freedoms can result in decisions that drastically open up or close off life opportunities. There are also large changes that occur in the brain during adolescence; the emotional center of the brain is now fully developed, but the rational frontal cortex has not matured fully and still is not able to keep all of those emotions in check. Adolescents tend to increase the amount of time spent with peers of the opposite gender; however, they still maintain the amount of time spent with those of the same gender—and do this by decreasing the amount of time spent with their parents.

Although adolescents look to peers and adults outside the family for guidance and models for how to behave, parents can remain influential in their development. Studies have shown that parents can have a significant impact, for instance, on how much teens drink. Other studies show that parents continued presence in provides stability and nurture to their developing adolescents.

During adolescence children begin to form their identity and start to test and develop the interpersonal and occupational roles that they will assume as adults. Therefore, it is important that parents treat them as young adults. Parental issues at this stage of parenting include dealing with rebelliousness related to a greater desire to partake in risky behaviors. In order to prevent risky behaviors, it is important for the parents to build a trusting relationship with their children. This can be achieved through behavioral control, parental monitoring, consistent discipline, parental warmth and support, inductive reasoning, and strong parent-child communication.

When a trusting relationship is built up, adolescents are more likely to approach their parents for help when faced with negative peer pressure. Helping children build a strong foundation will ultimately help them resist negative peer pressure. Not only will a positive relationship between adolescent and parent benefit when faced with peer pressure, it will help with identity-processing in early adolescents.
Research by Berzonsky et al. found that adolescents that were open and trusting of their parents were given more freedom and their parents were less likely to track them and control their behavior.

===Adults===
Parenting does not usually end when a child turns 18. Support may be needed in a child&#x27;s life well beyond the adolescent years and can continue into middle and later adulthood. Parenting can be a lifelong process. Parents may provide financial support to their adult children, which can also include providing an inheritance after death. The life perspective and wisdom given by a parent can benefit their adult children in their own lives. Becoming a grandparent is another milestone and has many similarities with parenting. Roles can be reversed in some ways when adult children become caregivers to their elderly parents.

== Assistance ==

Parents may receive assistance with caring for their children through child care programs.
Article 25.2 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights declares that:
== Childbearing and happiness ==
Data from the British Household Panel Survey and the German Socio-Economic Panel suggests that having up to two children increases happiness in the years around the birth, and mostly only for those who have postponed childbearing. However, having a third child is not shown to increase happiness. Data from a private opinion American survey, called Success Index, suggests that parenting is deemed important for people, especially for those aged 65 and older as compared to those aged 18 to 35. According to the survey, being a parent is now an integral part of the new American Dream.

<doc id="55700" wikidata="Q488262" url="?curid=55700" title="Tactile illusion">
<text>A tactile illusion is an illusion that affects the sense of touch. Some tactile illusions require active touch (e.g., movement of the fingers or hands), whereas others can be evoked passively (e.g., with external stimuli that press against the skin). In recent years, a growing interest among perceptual researchers has led to the discovery of new tactile illusions and to the celebration of tactile illusions in the popular science press. Some tactile illusions are analogous to visual and auditory illusions, suggesting that these sensory systems may process information in similar ways; other tactile illusions don&#x27;t have obvious visual or auditory analogs.

==Passive tactile spatiotemporal illusions==
Several tactile illusions are caused by dynamic stimulus sequences that press against the stationary skin surface.

*One of the best known passive tactile spatiotemporal illusions is the cutaneous rabbit illusion, in which a sequence of taps at two separated skin locations results in the perception that intervening skin regions were also tapped. The rabbit illusion, also called sensory saltation, occurs in vision and audition as well as in touch.
*The tau effect or perceptual length contraction is an illusion in which equally spaced taps to the skin are perceived as unequally spaced, depending on the timing between the taps. Specifically, a shorter temporal interval between two taps causes the illusion that the taps are closer together spatially. This illusion occurs also in vision and audition.
*The kappa effect or perceptual time dilation is a complementary illusion to the tau effect: taps separated by equal temporal intervals are perceived to be separated by unequal temporal interval, depending on the spatial intervals between the taps. Specifically, a longer spatial interval between taps causes the illusion that the taps are separated more in time. This illusion occurs also in vision and audition.
*If a person exposes their forearm and closes their eyes or turns their head in the opposite direction while a second person slowly traces a finger from the wrist upward to the crook of the elbow, many people are unable to say when the crease of their elbow is being touched.
*One of the least known passive tactile spatiotemporal illusions is the twisted lip illusion, in which a vertical edge touched to the two lips during a grimace is perceived to be tilted in the direction opposite to the skewed lips.

==Tactile adaptation illusions==
Many illusions in vision are caused by adaptation, the prolonged exposure to a previous stimulus. In such cases, the perception of a subsequent stimulus is altered. This phenomenon is sometimes referred to as a contingent after-effect. Similarly, adaptation can cause such illusions in the sense of touch.

*If one hand is immersed in cold water and the other in hot for a minute or so, and then both hands are placed in lukewarm water, the lukewarm water will feel hot to the hand previously immersed in cold water, and cold to the hand previously immersed in hot water.
*If a person is lying on their stomach with arms stretched in front and another person raises their arms about 2 feet off the ground and holds them there for approximately one minute, with the person on the ground having their eyes closed and head hanging, then slowly lowers the arms to the ground, it will feel as if the arms are going below the level of the rest of the body.
*Focal adaptation evoked by prolonged stimulation to a skin area causes the illusion that two subsequently presented stimulus points straddling that area are farther apart than they actually are. This perceptual repulsion illusion is analogous to various visual repulsion illusions such as visual tilt effects.

==Other tactile illusions==

*When eating, if a person holds food with one texture and another texture is presented to the mouth, many people perceive the perceived freshness and crispiness of the food to be between the two textures.
*When touching paradoxical objects, one can feel a hole when actually touching a bump. These &quot;illusory&quot; objects can be used to create tactile &quot;virtual objects&quot;.
*The thermal grill illusion occurs when one touches the hand down on an interlaced grid of warm and cool bars and experiences the illusion of burning heat. 
*When the thumb and forefinger are slid repeatedly along the edge of a wedge, a rectangular block then handled, in the same manner, will feel deformed.
*Moving the crossed index and middle finger along an edge evokes the perception of two parallel edges. Similarly, if a person crosses their index and middle finger and then rolls a marble between the tips of the fingers, two marbles are perceived.
*If a person wears a baseball cap for a long period of time and then takes it off, it may still be felt.
*If a person turns their tongue upside down, and runs their finger along the front, it will feel like the finger is moving in the opposite direction.
*If a person pushes outwards with their hands against something for a while, then stops, it will feel as if there is something stopping the person&#x27;s hands from closing together. Similarly, if a person pulls outwards with their arms, for example pulling their pants outwards, then stops, it will feel as if something is keeping their hands from staying at their sides.
*After exercising on a treadmill or walking on a moving sidewalk for extended periods, a person will often feel &quot;pulled forward&quot; when they step off onto stationary ground.
*If two people join their opposite hands and one slides their index and thumb over two joined fingers, they will feel the other finger like it was one of their own.
*If a person has been in the sea for a long time, they may afterwards still feel the ocean current pushing and pulling them.
*If a person vigorously spins their relaxed hands in circles around each other and then slowly moves the palms of their hands towards each other, they may feel a sensation akin to magnetic repulsion (or an &quot;invisible ball of energy&quot;) between their palms. 
It is possible to simulate a string being pulled out of ones hand or knee cap. Requires two people. Touching and tracing motions in the form of star like shapes. Such as an asterisk is drawn with person 2&#x27;s finger. On person 1. The. After 60 or 90 seconds. The person should pinch. The center and it feels like a string. Is being pulled from the palm, or knee.

<text>Hospital volunteers, also known as candy stripers in the United States, work without regular pay in a variety of health care settings, usually under the direct supervision of nurses.

The term candy striper is derived from the red-and-white striped pinafores that female volunteers traditionally wore, which are culturally reminiscent of candy canes. The term and its associated uniform are less frequently used in current clinical settings.

Another hospital volunteer organization sponsored by the American Red Cross, was the &quot;Blue Teens&quot; who wore blue-and-white striped pinafores. The female adult volunteers of this organization were known as &quot;Grey Ladies&quot; and wore light grey uniforms.

In the United States, volunteers&#x27; services are of considerable importance to individual patients as well as the health care system in general. Some people volunteer during high school or college (and more rarely at the middle school level), out of curiosity about health-care professions, an interest in learning to be of service in a community volunteer organization, or in order to satisfy community service requirements as required by some schools. Additionally, other people choose to volunteer at later stages in their life, particularly after retirement.

==History==
Candy Stripers originated as a high-school civics class project in East Orange, New Jersey, in 1944. The uniforms were sewn by the girls in the class from material provided by the teacher – a red-and-white-striped fabric known as &quot;candy stripe&quot;. The students chose East Orange General Hospital as the home for their class project.

Red Cross pins and patches were also worn on the uniforms indicating completion of required Red Cross training.

Usually a hospital sponsored either Candy Striper or Blue Teen volunteers but not both.

==Duties==
Duties of hospital volunteers vary widely depending upon the facility. Volunteers may work in staff reception areas and gift shops; file and retrieve documents and mails; take out trash; clean; provide administrative backup; assist with research by following strict sterilizing procedures for laboratory glass and plasticware, known as autoclaving; help visitors; visit with patients; or transport various small items like flowers, medical records, lab specimens, and drugs from unit to unit. Other volunteer tasks include running a music or art therapy program, where volunteers draw or play an instrument for the patients. Some hospitals even utilize volunteers to cuddle newborn babies.

A few hospitals ask their volunteers to help out with janitorial duties, such as stripping and remaking beds with clean linens. Other &quot;advanced volunteers&quot; include patient-care liaisons and volunteer orderlies. These volunteers must operate on the orders of a nurse or a physician and are given special training to permit them to work with patients. They are also more common in large hospitals, particularly university-affiliated hospitals and teaching hospitals, as they allow pre-medical students to gain experience in patient care by taking pressure off a busy care team.

Some hospitals manage their volunteers from a dispersal unit and assign them to tasks based on real-time labor demands, while other hospitals assign volunteers to a single unit for the duration of their service. Female volunteers traditionally wore pink-and-white jumpers, while male volunteers traditionally wore light-blue tunics or shirts over dark slacks. Today, male and female volunteers often wear a uniform shirt, polo shirt or some other short-sleeved shirt with slacks. Some volunteers (particularly &quot;advanced volunteers&quot;) will wear scrubs, but this is usually avoided so volunteers are not confused with medical personnel. All volunteers wear ID tags within the hospital that prominently indicate the volunteer&#x27;s status and position.

<text>Richard Whittington ( March 1423) of the parish of St Michael Paternoster Royal, City of London, was an English merchant and politician of the late medieval period. He is also the real-life inspiration for the English folk tale &quot;Dick Whittington and His Cat&quot;. He was four times (appointed once, elected three times) Lord Mayor of London, a member of parliament and a Sheriff of London. In his lifetime he financed a number of public projects, such as drainage systems in poor areas of London, and a hospital ward for unmarried mothers. He bequeathed his fortune to form the Charity of Sir Richard Whittington which, nearly 600 years later, continues to assist people in need.

==Early life==
He was born, in around 1354, into an ancient and wealthy Gloucestershire gentry family, the 3rd son of Sir William Whittington (d.1358) of Pauntley, in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, a member of parliament, by his wife Joan Maunsell, a daughter of William Maunsell (or Mansel), MP for Gloucestershire, Sheriff of Gloucestershire in 1313. His elder brothers were Robert Whittington (d.1423/4), six times a Member of Parliament for Gloucestershire, and William Whittington, also MP for Gloucestershire, the eldest brother.

As a younger son, under the system of primogeniture he would not expect to inherit his father&#x27;s estate, and thus was sent to the City of London to learn the trade of mercer through an apprenticeship. He was a contemporary of John Abbot who was the first mercer to leave property to the Mercers&#x27; Company to support a school.

== Career ==
Whittington became a successful merchant, dealing in valuable imports such as silks and velvets, both luxury fabrics, much of which he sold to royalty and nobility from about 1388. There is indirect evidence that he was also a major exporter to Europe of much-sought-after English woollen cloth such as broadcloth. From 1392 to 1394, he sold goods to King Richard II worth £3,500 (). He also began money-lending in 1388, preferring this to outward shows of wealth such as buying property. By 1397, he was lending large sums of money to the king.

In 1384, Whittington had become a Councilman of the City of London. In 1392, he was one of the City&#x27;s delegation to the king at Nottingham at which the king seized the City of London&#x27;s lands because of alleged misgovernment. By 1393, he had become an alderman and was appointed Sheriff of the City of London by the incumbent mayor, William Staundone, as well as becoming a member of the Worshipful Company of Mercers. Two days after the death of Adam Bamme in June 1397, Whittington was imposed on the City by the king as his replacement as Lord Mayor of London. Within days, Whittington had negotiated with the king a deal in which the City bought back its liberties for £10,000 (). He was formally elected as mayor by a grateful populace on 13 October 1397.

The deposition of King Richard II in 1399 did not affect Whittington and it is thought that he merely acquiesced in the coup led by Bolingbroke, later King Henry IV, whom Whittington had long supplied with merchandise. He also lent the new king substantial amounts of money. He was elected mayor again in 1406 and 1419, and during 1407 served as mayor of The Staple at Calais, representing that town&#x27;s merchants. In 1416 he became a member of parliament for the City of London. He was also influential with King Henry V, Henry IV&#x27;s son and successor, to whom he lent large amounts of money and for whom he served on several Royal Commissions of oyer and terminer; for example, Henry V employed him to supervise the expenditure to complete Westminster Abbey. Despite being a moneylender himself, he was sufficiently trusted and respected to sit as a judge in usury trials in 1421. Whittington also collected revenues and import duties. A long dispute with the Worshipful Company of Brewers over standard prices and measures of ale was won by Whittington.

==Marriage==

In 1402, at the age of 48, he married Alice FitzWaryn (d.1411), but she died without producing any children. She was one of the two daughters and joint heiresses of Sir Ivo FitzWaryn (1347–1414), of Caundle Haddon in Dorset, and of Wantage then in Berkshire (now Oxfordshire) (whose monumental brass survives in Wantage Church). As a member of parliament variously for the county seats of Dorset, Devon, and Somerset; a son of Sir William FitzWaryn, Knight of the Garter, of Whittington Castle in Shropshire, who was probably a son of Fulk FitzWarin, 3rd Baron FitzWarin (c.1315–1349), also of Whittington Castle in Shropshire and of Wantage, who were of an ancient and powerful family of Marcher Lords. A portrait of Richard Whittington circa 1590 by Reginald Elstrack shows his paternal heraldic arms and also for his wife a differenced version of the usual arms of Baron FitzWarin with &quot;ermine&quot; in the 1st and 4th quarters in place of &quot;argent&quot;, which variant was also used by Wiliam FitzWarin, a member of the Shropshire family, as depicted in the Gelre Armorial, c.1370–1414.

The last in the male line was Fulk FitzWarin, 7th Baron FitzWarin (1406–1420), whose eventual successor (via a female line) was William Bourchier, 9th Baron FitzWarin, second son of William Bourchier, 1st Count of Eu (1386–1420,) one of the wealthy noblemen to whom Richard Whittington lent money.

== Benefactions ==

In his lifetime Whittington donated much of his profit to the city, and he left further endowments by his will. He financed:
* the rebuilding of the Guildhall
* a ward for unmarried mothers at St Thomas&#x27; Hospital
* drainage systems for areas around Billingsgate and Cripplegate
* the rebuilding of his parish church, St Michael Paternoster Royal
* a public toilet seating 128 called Whittington&#x27;s Longhouse in the parish of St Martin Vintry that was cleansed by the River Thames at high tide
* most of Greyfriars library

He also provided accommodation for his apprentices in his own house. He passed a law prohibiting the washing of animal skins by apprentices in the River Thames in cold, wet weather because many young boys had died through hypothermia or drowning in the strong river currents.

== Death and burial ==

Whittington died in March 1423, aged around 68 or 69, and was buried in the church of St Michael Paternoster Royal, to which he had donated large sums during his lifetime. The tomb is now lost, and the mummified cat found in the church tower in 1949 during a search for its location probably dates to the time of the Wren restoration.

==Bequests==

Having died childless, Whittington left £7,000 in his will to charity, in those days a large sum, . Some of this was used to:
* rebuild Newgate Prison and Newgate and accommodation in it for the Sheriffs and Recorder, which is the forerunner of that in the Old Bailey
* build the first library in Guildhall (the ancestor of the modern Guildhall Library)
* repair St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital
* create his &#x27;college&#x27; i.e. almshouse and hospital, originally at St Michael&#x27;s
* install some of the first public drinking fountains
The almshouses were relocated in 1966 to Felbridge, near East Grinstead. Sixty elderly women and a few married couples currently live in them. The Whittington Charity also disburses money each year to the needy through the Mercers&#x27; Company.

To mark his bequests, the Whittington hospital at Archway in the London Borough of Islington was named after him on its establishment in 1948.

== Dick Whittington—stage character ==
The gifts left in Whittington&#x27;s will made him well known and he became a character in an English story that was adapted for the stage as a play, &quot;The History of Richard Whittington, of his lowe byrth, his great fortune&quot;, in February 1604. In the 19th century this became popular as a pantomime called &quot;Dick Whittington and His Cat&quot;, very loosely based on Richard Whittington. There are several versions of the traditional story, which tells how Dick, a boy from a poor Gloucestershire family, sets out for London to make his fortune, accompanied by, or later acquiring, his cat. At first he meets with little success, and is tempted to return home. However, on his way out of the city, whilst climbing Highgate Hill from modern-day Archway, he hears the Bow Bells of London ringing, and believes they are sending him a message. There is now a large hospital on Highgate Hill, named the Whittington Hospital, after this supposed episode. A traditional rhyme associated with this tale is:

On returning to London, Dick embarks on a series of adventures. In one version of the tale, he travels abroad on a ship, and wins many friends as a result of the rat-catching activities of his cat; in another he sends his cat and it is sold to make his fortune. Eventually he does become prosperous, marries his master&#x27;s daughter Alice Fitzwarren (the name of the real Whittington&#x27;s wife), and is made Lord Mayor of London three times. The common belief that he served three rather than four times as Lord Mayor stems from the City&#x27;s records &#x27;Liber Albus&#x27; compiled at his request by the City Clerk John Carpenter wherein his name appears only three times as the remainder term of his deceased predecessor Adam Bamme and his own consequent term immediately afterwards appear as one entry for 1397.

As the son of gentry, Whittington was never very poor and there is no evidence that he kept a cat. Whittington may have become associated with a thirteenth-century Persian folktale about an orphan who gained a fortune through his cat; the tale was common throughout Europe at that time. Folklorists have suggested that the most popular legends about Whittington—that his fortunes were founded on the sale of his cat, who was sent on a merchant vessel to a rat-beset Eastern emperor—originated in a popular 17th-century engraving by Renold Elstracke in which his hand rested on a cat, but the picture only reflects a story already in wide circulation. Elstracke&#x27;s oddly-shaped cat was in fact a later replacement by printseller Peter Stent for what had been a skull in the original, with the change being made to conform to the story already in existence, to increase sales.

There was also known to be a painted portrait of Whittington shown with a cat, hanging at Mercer Hall, but it was reported that the painting had been trimmed down to smaller size, and the date &quot;1572&quot; that appears there was something painted after the cropping, which raises doubt as to the authenticity of the date, though Malcolm who witnessed it felt the date should be taken in good faith. The print published in &quot;The New Wonderful Museum&quot; (vol. III, 1805, pictured above) is presumably a replica of this painting.

<doc id="55708" wikidata="Q3481968" url="?curid=55708" title="Sherman Silver Purchase Act">
<text>The Sherman Silver Purchase Act was a United States federal law enacted on July 14, 1890, which increased the amount of silver the government was required to purchase on a recurrent monthly basis to 4.5 million ounces, roughly the entirety of the American output.

The act did not authorize the free and unlimited coinage of silver that the Free Silver supporters wanted. Instead, it had been passed in response to the growing complaints of farmers&#x27; and miners&#x27; interests. Farmers are usually debtors, with mortgages on their farms and loans on their crops; deflation meant that they had to pay back these loans in more
expensive dollars, and this act promotes inflation. Mining companies, meanwhile, had extracted vast quantities of silver from western mines. The resulting oversupply drove down the price of their product, often to below the point at which the silver could be profitably extracted. They hoped to enlist the government to increase the demand for silver.

Originally, the bill was simply known as the Silver Purchase Act of 1890. Only after the bill was signed into law did it become the &quot;Sherman Silver Purchase Act.&quot; Senator John Sherman, an Ohio Republican and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, was not the author of the bill, but once both houses of Congress had passed the Act and the Act had been sent to a Senate/House conference committee to settle differences between the Senate and House versions of the Act, Sherman was instrumental in getting the conference committee to reach agreement on a final draft of the Act. Nonetheless, once agreement on the final version was reached in the conference committee, Sherman found that he disagreed with many sections of the act. So tepid was Sherman&#x27;s support that when he was asked his opinion of the act by President Benjamin Harrison, Sherman ventured only that the bill was &quot;safe&quot; and would cause no harm if the President signed it.

The act was enacted in tandem with the McKinley Tariff of 1890. William McKinley, an Ohio Republican and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, worked with John Sherman to create a package that could both pass the Senate and receive the President&#x27;s approval.

Under the Act, the federal government purchased millions of ounces of silver, with issues of paper currency. It became the second-largest buyer in the world, after the British Crown in India, where the Indian rupee was backed by silver rather than gold. Instead of the million to million that had been required by the Bland–Allison Act of 1878, the US government was now required to purchase 4.5 million ounces of silver bullion every month. The law required the Treasury to buy the silver with a special issue of Treasury (Coin) Notes that could be redeemed for either silver or gold. The result was the substantial expansion in the volume of circulating dollars without a proportionate growth in the gold stock. The crash in the silver dollar&#x27;s bullion value in the 1890s from 80 cents to approximately 50 cents increased public anxiety on their continued ability to convert silver dollars and banknotes into gold. The result was a run on the Treasury&#x27;s gold stock and the onset of the Panic of 1893. President Grover Cleveland summoned an emergency session of Congress on August 7, 1893, for the repeal of the act to prevent the further depletion of the government&#x27;s gold reserves.

In 1890, the price of silver dipped to per ounce. By the end of the year, it had fallen to . By December 1894, the price had dropped to . On November 1, 1895, US mints halted production of silver coins, and the government closed the Carson City Mint. Banks discouraged the use of silver dollars. The years 1893–95 had the lowest productions of Morgan dollars for the entire series, creating several scarce coins.

<doc id="55710" wikidata="Q6801942" url="?curid=55710" title="McKinley Tariff">
<text>The Tariff Act of 1890, commonly called the McKinley Tariff, was an act of the United States Congress, framed by then Representative William McKinley, that became law on October 1, 1890. The tariff raised the average duty on imports to almost 50%, an increase designed to protect domestic industries and workers from foreign competition, as promised in the Republican platform. It represented protectionism, a policy supported by Republicans and denounced by Democrats. It was a major topic of fierce debate in the 1890 Congressional elections, which gave a Democratic landslide. Democrats replaced the McKinley Tariff with the Wilson–Gorman Tariff Act in 1894, which lowered tariff rates.

==Description==

After 450 amendments, the Tariff Act of 1890 was passed and increased average duties across all imports from 38% to 49.5%. McKinley was known as the &quot;Napoleon of Protection&quot;, and rates were raised on some goods and lowered on others, always in an attempt to protect American manufacturing interests. Changes in duties for specific products such as tinplates and wool were the most controversial ones and were emblematic of the spirit of the Tariff of 1890. The Act eliminated tariffs altogether on certain items, with the threat of reinstatement as an enticement to get other countries to lower their tariffs on items imported from the US.

===Eliminated tariffs===
The Act removed tariffs on sugar, molasses, tea, coffee, and hides but authorized the President to reinstate the tariffs if the items were exported from countries that treated U.S. exports in a &quot;reciprocally unequal and unreasonable&quot; fashion. The idea was &quot;to secure reciprocal trade&quot; by allowing the executive branch to use the threat of reimposing tariffs as a means to get other countries to lower their tariffs on U.S. exports. Although this delegation of power had the appearance of being an unconstitutional violation of the nondelegation doctrine, it was upheld by the Supreme Court in &quot;Field v. Clark&quot; in 1892, as authorizing the executive to act merely as an &quot;agent&quot; of Congress, rather than as a lawmaker itself. The President did not use the delegated power to re-impose tariffs on the five types of imported goods, but he used the threat of doing so to pass 10 treaties in which other countries reduced their tariffs on U.S. goods.

===Tin-plates===
Tin-plates were a major import for the United States. Tens of millions of dollars in these goods entered the country each year. In the preceding 20 years, tariff rates had been raised and dropped multiple times on tin-plates with no change in import levels, and domestic production had remained inconsequential. In a last attempt to stimulate the infant domestic tin-plate industry, the Act raised the duty level from 30% to 70%. It also included a unique provision that stated tin-plates should be admitted free of any duty after 1897 unless domestic production in any year reached one-third of the imports in that year. The goal was for the duty to be protective or not to exist at all.

===Wool===
The new tariff provisions for wool and woolen goods were exceedingly protectionist. Wool was previously taxed based on a schedule: more valuable wool was taxed at a higher rate. Through a multitude of complicated tariff schedule revisions, the Act made almost all woolen goods subject to the maximum duty rate. The Act also increased the tariff on carpet wool, a wool of very low quality not produced in the US. The government wanted to ensure that importers were not declaring higher-quality wool as carpet wool to evade the tariff.

==Reactions==
The tariff was not well received by Americans who suffered a steep increase in prices. In the 1890 election, Republicans lost their majority in the House with the number of seats they won reduced by nearly half, from 171 to 88. In the 1892 presidential election, Harrison was soundly defeated by Grover Cleveland, and the Senate, House, and Presidency were all under Democratic control. Lawmakers immediately started drafting new tariff legislation, and in 1894, the Wilson-Gorman Tariff passed, which lowered US tariff averages. The 1890 tariff was also poorly received abroad. Protectionists in the British Empire used it to argue for tariff retaliation and imperial trade preference.

==Background==
Tariffs (taxes on foreign goods entering a country) served two purposes for the United States in the late 19th century. One was to raise revenue for the federal government, and the other was to protect domestic manufacturers and workers from foreign competition, known as protectionism. In December 1887, President Grover Cleveland, a Democrat, devoted his entire State of the Union Address to the issue of the tariff and called emphatically for the reduction of duties and the abolition of duties on raw materials. The speech succeeded in making the tariff and the idea of protectionism a true party matter. In the 1888 election, the Republicans were victorious with the election of Benjamin Harrison and majorities in both the Senate and the House. For the sake of holding the party line, the Republicans felt obligated to pass stronger tariff legislation.

William McKinley of Ohio was defeated by Thomas Brackett Reed to be Speaker of the House after the 1888 elections. McKinley instead became chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee and was responsible for framing a new tariff bill. He believed that a protectionist tariff had been mandated by the people through the election and that it was necessary for America&#x27;s wealth and prosperity. In addition to the protectionist debate, politicians were concerned about the high revenue accruing from tariffs. After the American Civil War, tariffs remained elevated to raise revenue and to cover the high costs of the war. By the early 1880s, the federal government was running a large surplus. Both parties agreed that the surplus needed to lessen but disagreed about whether to raise or lower tariffs to accomplish the same goal. The Democrats&#x27; hypothesis stated that tariff revenue could be reduced by reducing the tariff rate. Conversely, the Republicans&#x27; belief was that by increasing the tariff, imports would be lessened, and total tariff revenue would drop. The debate would be known as the Great Tariff Debate of 1888.

==Effects==

Douglas Irwin&#x27;s 1998 paper examines the validity of the opposing tariff hypotheses posed by Republicans and Democrats in 1890. Irwin analyzed historical data to estimate import demand elasticities and export supply elasticities for the United States in the years before 1888. He calculated that tariffs had not yet reached the maximum revenue rate, suggesting that a reduction, rather than an increase, in tariffs would have reduced both revenue and the federal surplus. This finding supported the Democrats’ hypothesis and refuted the Republicans’.

Irwin further analyzed tariff revenue data and observed that total revenue decreased by about 4%, from $225 million to $215 million, after the 1890 Tariff increased rates. He attributed this drop largely to the provision that moved raw sugar to the duty-free list. Since sugar was the top revenue-generating import at the time, making it duty-free caused a significant revenue reduction. Irwin also calculated that if sugar were excluded from import calculations, tariff revenue actually increased by 7.8%, from $170 million to $183 million. He concluded that the tariff hastened the development of domestic tinplate production by about a decade but argued that the benefit to this industry was outweighed by the overall cost to consumers.

<doc id="55711" wikidata="Q17148550" url="?curid=55711" title="Wilson–Gorman Tariff Act">
<text>The Revenue Act or Wilson-Gorman Tariff of 1894 (ch. 349, §73, , August 27, 1894) slightly reduced the United States tariff rates from the numbers set in the 1890 McKinley tariff and imposed a 2% tax on income over $4,000. It is named for William L. Wilson, Representative from West Virginia, chair of the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee, and Senator Arthur P. Gorman of Maryland, both Democrats.

Supported by pro-free trade members of the Democratic Party, this attempt at tariff reform imposed the first peacetime income tax (2% on income over $4,000, or $88,100 in 2010 dollars, which meant fewer than 1% of households would pay any). The purpose of the income tax was to make up for revenue that would be lost by tariff reductions. The Democrats under the Grover Cleveland administration wanted to move away from the protectionism proposed by the McKinley tariff while Cleveland was still in office. By coincidence, $4,000 ($88,100 in 2010 dollars) would be the exemption for married couples when the Revenue Act of (October) 1913 was signed into law by President Woodrow Wilson, as a result of the ratification of the 16th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in February 1913.

The bill introduced by Wilson and passed by the House significantly lowered tariff rates, in accordance with Democratic platform promises, and dropped the tariff to zero on iron ore, coal, lumber and wool, which angered American producers. With Senator Gorman operating behind the scenes, protectionists in the Senate added more than 600 amendments that nullified most of the reforms and raised rates again. The &quot;Sugar Trust&quot; in particular made changes that favored itself at the expense of the foreign competitors.

President Grover Cleveland, who had campaigned on lowering the tariff and supported Wilson&#x27;s version of the bill, was devastated that his program had been ruined. He denounced the revised measure as a disgraceful product of &quot;party perfidy and party dishonor,&quot; but still allowed it to become law without his signature, believing that it was better than nothing and was at the least an improvement over the McKinley tariff.

==Income Tax Amendment==
The &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that many Democrats in the East &quot;prefer to take the income tax, odious as it is, and unpopular as it is bound to be with their constituents&quot; to defeating the Wilson tariff bill. Democratic Representative Johnson of Ohio supported the income tax as the lesser of two evils:
&quot;he was for an income tax as against a tariff tax; but he believed, that it was un-Democratic, inquisitorial, and wrong in principle.&quot;

==Legacy==
The income tax provision was struck down in 1895 by the U.S. Supreme Court case &quot;Pollock v. Farmers&#x27; Loan &amp; Trust Co.&quot;, . In 1913, the 16th Amendment permitted a federal income tax.

The tariff provisions of Wilson-Gorman were superseded by the Dingley Tariff of 1897.

<text>The Dawes Act of 1887 (also known as the General Allotment Act or the Dawes Severalty Act of 1887) regulated land rights on tribal territories within the United States. Named after Senator Henry L. Dawes of Massachusetts, it authorized the President of the United States to subdivide Native American tribal communal landholdings into allotments for Native American heads of families and individuals. This would convert traditional systems of land tenure into a government-imposed system of private property by forcing Native Americans to &quot;assume a capitalist and proprietary relationship with property&quot; that did not previously exist in their cultures. Before private property could be dispensed, the government had to determine which Indians were eligible for allotments, which propelled an official search for a federal definition of &quot;Indian-ness&quot;.

Although the act was passed in 1887, the federal government implemented the Dawes Act on a tribe-by-tribe basis thereafter. For example, in 1895, Congress passed the Hunter Act, which administered the Dawes Act among the Southern Ute. The nominal purpose of the act was to protect the property of the natives as well as to compel &quot;their absorption into the American mainstream&quot;.

Native peoples who were deemed to be mixed-blood were granted U.S. citizenship, while others were &quot;detribalized&quot;. Between 1887 and 1934, Native Americans ceded control of about 100 million acres of land (as of 2019 the United States has a total 1.9 billion acres of land) or about &quot;two-thirds of the land base they held in 1887&quot; as a result of the act. The loss of land ownership and the break-up of traditional leadership of tribes produced potentially negative cultural and social effects that have since prompted some scholars to consider the act as one of the most destructive U.S. policies for Native Americans in history.

The &quot;Five Civilized Tribes&quot; (Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Muscogee, and Seminole) in Indian Territory were initially exempt from the Dawes Act. The Dawes Commission was established in 1893 as a delegation to register members of tribes for allotment of lands. They came to define tribal belonging in terms of blood-quantum. However, because there was no method of determining precise bloodlines, commission members often assigned &quot;full-blood status&quot; to Native Americans who were perceived as &quot;poorly-assimilated&quot; or &quot;legally incompetent&quot;, and &quot;mixed-blood status&quot; to Native Americans who &quot;most resembled whites&quot;, regardless of how they identified culturally.

The Curtis Act of 1898 extended the provisions of the Dawes Act to the &quot;Five Civilized Tribes&quot;, required the abolition of their governments and dissolution of tribal courts, allotment of communal lands to individuals registered as tribal members, and sale of lands declared surplus. This law was &quot;an outgrowth of the land rush of 1889, and completed the extinction of Indian land claims in the territory. This violated the promise of the United States that the Indian territory would remain Indian land in perpetuity,&quot; completed the obliteration of tribal land titles in Indian Territory, and prepared for admission of the territory land to the Union as the state of Oklahoma. The Dawes Act was amended again in 1906 under the Burke Act.

During the Great Depression, the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration passed the US Indian Reorganization Act (also known as the Wheeler-Howard Law) on June 18, 1934. It prohibited any further land allotment and created a &quot;New Deal&quot; for Native Americans, which renewed their rights to reorganize and form self-governments in order to &quot;rebuild an adequate land base.&quot;

==Creation of reservations and assimilation==
During the early 1800s, the United States federal government attempted to address what it referred to as the &quot;Indian Problem.&quot; Numerous European immigrants were settling on the eastern border of the Indian territories (where most of the Native American tribes had been relocated). Conflicts between the groups increased as they competed for resources and operated according to different cultural systems. Searching for a quick solution to their problem, Commissioner of Indian Affairs William Medill proposed establishing &quot;colonies&quot; or &quot;reservations&quot; that would be exclusively for the natives, similar to those which some native tribes had created for themselves in the east. It was a form of relocation whereby the US government would offer a transfer of the natives from current locations to areas in the region beyond the Mississippi River. This would enable settlement by European Americans in the Southeast, where there was a growing demand for access to new lands.

The new policy intended to concentrate Native Americans in areas away from the new settlers. During the later nineteenth century, Native American tribes resisted the imposition of the reservation system and engaged with the United States Army (in what were called the Indian Wars in the West) for decades. Finally defeated by the U.S. military force and continuing waves of new settlers, the tribes negotiated agreements to resettle on reservations. Native Americans ended up with a total of over of land, ranging from arid deserts to prime agricultural land.

The Reservation system, while compulsory for Native Americans, allotted each tribe a claim to their new lands, protection over their territories, and the right to govern themselves. With the U.S. Senate to be involved only for negotiation and ratification of treaties, the Native Americans adjusted their ways of life and tried to maintain their traditions. The traditional tribal organization, a defining characteristic of Native Americans as a social unit, became apparent to the non-native communities of the United States. The tribe was viewed as a highly cohesive group, led by a hereditary, chosen chief, who exercised power and influence among the members of the tribe by aging traditions.

By the end of the 1880s, some U.S. stakeholders felt that the assimilation of Native Americans into American culture was a top priority and was needed for the peoples&#x27; very survival. This was the belief among people who &quot;admired&quot; them, as well as people who thought they needed to leave behind their tribal landholding, reservations, traditions, and, ultimately, their Indian identities. Senator Henry Dawes launched a campaign to &quot;rid the nation of tribalism through the virtues of private property, allotting land parcels to Indian heads of family.&quot;

On February 8, 1887, President Grover Cleveland signed the Dawes Allotment Act into law. Responsible for enacting the allotment of the tribal reservations into plots of land for individual households, the Dawes Act was intended by reformers to achieve six goals:
* breaking up of tribes as a social unit,
* encouraging individual initiatives,
* furthering the progress of native farmers,
* reducing the cost of native administration,
* securing parts of the reservations as Indian land, and
* opening the remainder of the land to White settlers for profit.

The Act facilitated assimilation; they would become more &quot;Americanized&quot; as the government allotted the reservations and the Indians adapted to subsistence farming, the primary model at the time. Native Americans held specific ideologies pertaining to tribal land. 
Some natives began to adapt to the culture. They adopted the values of the dominant society and saw land as real estate to be bought and developed; they learned how to use their land effectively to become prosperous farmers. As they were inducted as citizens of the country, they would shed those of their discourses and ideologies presumed to be uncivilized and exchange them for ones that allowed them to become industrious, self-supporting citizens, and finally rid themselves of their need for government supervision.

==Provisions of the Dawes Act==
The important provisions of the Dawes Act were:
# A head of family would receive a grant of , a single person or orphan over 18 years of age would receive a grant of , and persons under the age of 18 would receive each;
# the allotments would be held in trust by the U.S. Government for 25 years;
# Eligible Native Americans had four years to select their land; afterward the selection would be made for them by the Secretary of the Interior.

Every member of the bands or tribes receiving a land allotment is subject to laws of the state or territory in which they reside. Every Native American who receives a land allotment &quot;and has adopted the habits of civilized life&quot; (lived separate and apart from the tribe) is bestowed with United States citizenship &quot;without in any manner impairing or otherwise affecting the right of any such Indian to tribal or other property&quot;.

The Secretary of the Interior could issue rules to assure equal distribution of water for irrigation among the tribes, and provided that &quot;no other appropriation or grant of water by any riparian proprietor shall be authorized or permitted to the damage of any other riparian proprietor.&quot;

The Dawes Act did not apply to the territory of the:
* Cherokee, Creek, Choctaw, Chickasaw, Seminole, Miami, and Peoria in Indian Territory
* Osage and Sac and Fox in the Oklahoma Territory
* any of the reservations of the Seneca Nation of New York, or
* a strip of territory in the State of Nebraska adjoining the Sioux Nation
* Red Lake Ojibwe Reservation
* The Osage Tribe of Oklahoma

Provisions were later extended to the Wea, Peoria, Kaskaskia, Piankeshaw, and Western Miami tribes by act of 1889. Allotment of the lands of these tribes was mandated by the Act of 1891, which amplified the provisions of the Dawes Act.

===Dawes Act 1891 Amendments===
In 1891 the Dawes Act was amended:
* Allowed for pro-rata distribution when the reservation did not have enough land for each individual to receive allotments in original quantities, and provided that when land is only suitable for grazing purposes, such land be allotted in double quantities
* Established criteria for inheritance
* Does not apply to Cherokee Outlet

===Provisions of the Curtis Act===
The Curtis Act of 1898 extended the provisions of the Dawes Act to the Five Civilized Tribes in Indian Territory. It did away with their self-government, including tribal courts. In addition to providing for allotment of lands to tribal members, it authorized the Dawes Commission to make determinations of members when registering tribal members.

===Provisions of the Burke Act===
The Burke Act of 1906 amended the sections of the Dawes Act dealing with US Citizenship (Section 6) and the mechanism for issuing allotments. The Secretary of Interior could force the Native American Allottee to accept title for land. U.S. Citizenship was granted unconditionally upon receipt of land allotment (the individual did not need to move off the reservation to receive citizenship). Land allotted to Native Americans was taken out of Trust and subject to taxation. The Burke Act did not apply to any Native Americans in Indian Territory.

==Effects==
=== Identity and detribalization ===
The effects of the Dawes Act were destructive on Native American sovereignty, culture, and identity since it empowered the U.S. government to:

# legally preempt the sovereign right of Indians to define themselves
# implement the specious notion of blood-quantum as the legal criteria for defining Indians
# institutionalize divisions between &quot;full-bloods&quot; and &quot;mixed-bloods&quot;
# &quot;detribalize&quot; a sizeable segment of the Indian population
# legally appropriate vast tracts of Indian land

The federal government initially viewed the Dawes Act as such a successful democratic experiment that they decided to further explore the use of blood-quantum laws and the notion of federal recognition as the qualifying means for &quot;dispensing other resources and services such as health care and educational funding&quot; to Native Americans long after its passage. Under Dawes, land parcels were dispersed in accordance with perceived blood quanta. Indigenous people labeled &quot;full-blooded&quot; were allocated &quot;relatively small parcels of land deeded with trust patents over which the government retained complete control for a minimum of twenty-five years.&quot; Those who were labeled &quot;mixed-blood&quot; were &quot;deeded larger and better tracts of land, with &#x27;patents in fee simple&#x27; (complete control), but were also forced to accept U.S. citizenship and relinquish tribal status.&quot;

Additionally, Native Americans who did not &quot;meet the established criteria&quot; as being either &quot;full-blood&quot; or &quot;mixed-blood&quot; were effectively &quot;detribalized&quot;, being &quot;deposed of their American Indian identity and displaced from their homelands, discarded into the nebula of American otherness.&quot; While the Dawes Act is &quot;typically recognized&quot; as the &quot;primary instigation of divisions between tribal and detribalized Indians,&quot; the history of detribalization in the United States &quot;actually precedes Dawes.&quot;

=== Land loss ===
The Dawes Act ended Native American communal holding of property (with cropland often being privately owned by families or clans), by which they had ensured that everyone had a home and a place in the tribe. The act &quot;was the culmination of American attempts to destroy tribes and their governments and to open Indian lands to settlement by non-Indians and to development by railroads.&quot; Land owned by Native Americans decreased from in 1887 to in 1934.

Senator Henry M. Teller of Colorado was one of the most outspoken opponents of allotment. In 1881, he said that allotment was a policy &quot;to despoil the Indians of their lands and to make them vagabonds on the face of the earth.&quot; Teller also said,

the real aim [of allotment] was to get at the Indian lands and open them up to settlement. The provisions for the apparent benefit of the Indians are but the pretext to get at his lands and occupy them. ... If this were done in the name of greed, it would be bad enough; but to do it in the name of humanity ... is infinitely worse.

In 1890, Dawes himself remarked about the incidence of Native Americans losing their land allotments to settlers: &quot;I never knew a White man to get his foot on an Indian&#x27;s land who ever took it off.&quot; The amount of land in native hands rapidly depleted from some to by 1900. The remainder of the land, once allotted to appointed natives, was declared surplus and sold to non-native settlers as well as railroad and other large corporations; other sections were converted into federal parks and military compounds.

Most allottees given land on the Great Plains were not successful at achieving economic viability via farming. Division of land among heirs upon the allottees&#x27; deaths quickly led to land fractionalization. Most allotment land, which could be sold after a statutory period of 25 years, was eventually sold to non-Native buyers at bargain prices. Additionally, land deemed to be surplus beyond what was needed for allotment was opened to White settlers, though the profits from the sales of these lands were often invested in programs meant to aid the Native Americans. Over the 47 years of the Act&#x27;s life, Native Americans lost about of treaty land, or about two-thirds of the 1887 land base. About 90,000 Native Americans were made landless.

=== Culture and gender roles ===
The Dawes Act compelled Native Americans to adopt European American culture by prohibiting Indigenous cultural practices and encouraging settler cultural practices and ideologies into Native American families and children. By transferring communally-owned Native land into private property, the Office of Indian Affairs (OIA) &quot;hoped to transform Native Americans into yeoman farmers and farm wives through the assignment of individual land holdings known as allotments.&quot; In an attempt to fulfill this objective, the Dawes Act &quot;outlawed Native American culture and established a code of Indian offenses regulating individual behavior according to Euro-American norms of conduct.&quot; Any violations of this code were to be &quot;tried in a Court of Indian Offenses on each reservation.&quot; Included with the Dawes Act were &quot;funds to instruct Native Americans in Euro-American patterns of thought and behavior through Indian Service schools.&quot;

With the seizure of many Native American land holdings, indigenous structures of domestic life, gender roles, and tribal identity were critically altered in order to meld with society. For instance, &quot;an important objective of the Dawes Act was to restructure Native American gender roles.&quot; White settlers who encountered Native American societies in the latter half of the nineteenth century &quot;judged women&#x27;s work [in Native societies] as lower in status than that of men&quot; and assumed it was a sign of indigenous women&#x27;s &quot;disempowerment and drudgery&quot;. As a result, &quot;in evolutionary terms, Whites saw women&#x27;s performance of what seemed to be male tasks – farming, home building, and supply gathering – as a corruption of gender roles and an impediment to progress.&quot; In theory, the gendered tasks &quot;accorded many indigenous women esteem and even rewards and status within their tribes.&quot;

By dividing reservation lands into privately owned parcels, legislators hoped to complete the assimilation process by forcing Native Americans to adopt individual households and strengthen the nuclear family and values of economic dependency strictly within this small household unit. The Dawes Act was thus implemented to destroy &quot;native cultural patterns&quot; by drawing &quot;on theories, common to both ethnologists and material feminists, that saw environmental change as a way to effect social change.&quot; Although private property ownership was the cornerstone of the act, reformers &quot;believed that civilization could only be effected by concomitant changes to social life&quot; in indigenous communities. As a result, &quot;they promoted Christian marriages among indigenous people, forced families to regroup under male heads (a tactic often enforced by renaming), and trained men in wage-earning occupations while encouraging women to support them at home through domestic activities.&quot;

=== Reduction of sovereignty ===
In 1906, the Burke Act (also known as the Forced Patenting Act) amended the GAA to give the Secretary of the Interior the power to issue allottees a patent in fee simple to people classified &quot;competent and capable&quot;. The criteria for this determination is unclear but it meant that allottees deemed &quot;competent&quot; by the Secretary of the Interior would have their land taken out of trust status, subject to taxation, and could be sold by the allottee. The allotted lands of Native Americans determined to be incompetent by the Secretary of the Interior were automatically leased out by the federal government.
The act reads:
... the Secretary of the Interior may, in his discretion, and he is hereby authorized, whenever he shall be satisfied that any Native American allottee is competent and capable of managing his or her affairs at any time to cause to be issued to such allottee a patent in fee simple, and thereafter all restrictions as to sale, encumbrance, or taxation of said land shall be removed.

The use of competence opens up the categorization, making it much more subjective and thus increasing the exclusionary power of the Secretary of Interior. Although this act gave power to the allottee to decide whether to keep or sell the land, given the harsh economic reality of the time, and lack of access to credit and markets, liquidation of Indian lands was almost inevitable. It was known by the Department of Interior that virtually 95% of fee-patented land would eventually be sold to whites.

In 1926, Secretary of the Interior Hubert Work commissioned a study of the federal administration of Indian policy and the condition of Native American people. Completed in 1928, &quot;The Problem of Indian Administration&quot;commonly known as the Meriam Report after the study&#x27;s director, Lewis Meriam documented fraud and misappropriation by government agents. In particular, the Meriam Report claimed that the General Allotment Act had been used to illegally deprive Native Americans of their land rights.

After considerable debate, Congress terminated the allotment process under the Dawes Act by enacting the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 (&quot;Wheeler-Howard Act&quot;). However, the allotment process in Alaska, under the separate Alaska Native Allotment Act, continued until its revocation in 1971 by the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act.

Despite the termination of the allotment process in 1934, the effects of the General Allotment Act continue into the present. For example, one provision of the Act was the establishment of a trust fund, administered by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, to collect and distribute revenues from oil, mineral, timber, and grazing leases on Native American lands. The BIA&#x27;s alleged improper management of the trust fund resulted in litigation, in particular the case &quot;Cobell v. Kempthorne&quot; (settled in 2009 for $3.4 billion), to force a proper accounting of revenues.

===Fractionation===

For over one hundred thirty years, the consequences of federal Indian allotments have developed into the problem of &quot;fractionation&quot;. As original allottees die, their heirs receive equal, undivided interests in the allottees&#x27; lands. In successive generations, smaller undivided interests descend to the next generation. Fractionated interests in individual Native American allotted land continue to expand exponentially with each new generation.

In 2004, Ross Swimmer, Special Trustee for American Indians at the U.S. Department of the Interior, stated that there were &quot;approximately four million owner interests in the of individually owned trust lands, a situation the magnitude of which makes management of trust assets extremely difficult and costly.&quot; &quot;These four million interests could expand to eleven million interests by the year 2030 unless an aggressive approach to fractionation is taken.&quot; &quot;There are now single pieces of property with ownership interests that are less than 0.0000001% or 1/9 millionth of the whole interest, which has an estimated value of 0.004 cent.&quot;

The economic consequences of fractionation are severe. Some recent appraisal studies suggest that when the number of owners of a tract of land reaches between ten and twenty, the value of that tract drops to zero.

In addition, the fractionation of land and the resultant ballooning number of trust accounts quickly produced an administrative nightmare. Over the past 40 years, the area of trust land has grown by approximately per year. Approximately 357 million dollars is collected annually from all sources of trust asset management, including coal sales, timber harvesting, oil and gas leases and other rights-of-way and lease activity. No single fiduciary institution has ever managed as many trust accounts as the Department of the Interior has managed over the last century.

Interior is involved in &quot;the management of 100,000 leases for individual [Native Americans] and tribes on trust land that encompasses approximately . Leasing, use permits, sale revenues, and interest of approximately $226 million per year are collected for approximately 230,000 individual Indian money [(IIM)] accounts, and about $530 million per year are collected for approximately 1,400 tribal accounts. In addition, the trust currently manages approximately $2.8 billion in tribal funds and $400 million in individual Native American funds.&quot;

&quot;Under current regulations, probates need to be conducted for every account with trust assets, even those with balances between one cent and one dollar. While the average cost for a probate process exceeds $3,000, even a streamlined, expedited process...costing as little as $500 would require almost $10,000,000 to probate the $5,700 in these accounts.&quot;

&quot;Unlike most private trusts, the federal government bears the entire cost of administering the Indian trust. As a result, the usual incentives found in the commercial sector for reducing the number of small or inactive accounts do not apply to the Indian trust. Similarly, the United States has not adopted many of the tools that States and local government entities have for ensuring that unclaimed or abandoned property is returned to productive use within the local community.&quot;

Fractionation is not a new issue. In the 1920s, the Brookings Institution conducted a major study of the conditions of the Native Americans and included data on the impacts of fractionation. This report, which became known as the Meriam Report, was issued in 1928. Its conclusions and recommendations formed the basis for land reform provisions that were included in what would become the IRA. &quot;The original versions of the IRA included two key titles; one dealing with probate and the other with land consolidation.&quot; Because of opposition to many of these provisions in Indian Country, often by the major European-American ranchers and industry who leased land and other private interests, most were removed while Congress was considering the bill. The final version of the IRA included only a few basic land reforms and probate measures. Although Congress enabled major reforms in the structure of tribes through the IRA and stopped the allotment process, it did not meaningfully address fractionation as had been envisioned by John Collier, then Commissioner of Indian Affairs, or the Brookings Institution.

&quot;In 1922, the General Accounting Office (GAO) conducted an audit of 12 reservations to determine the severity of fractionation on those reservations. The GAO found that on the 12 reservations for which it compiled data, there were approximately 80,000 discrete owners but, because of fractionation, there were over a million ownership records associated with those owners. The GAO also found that if the land were physically divided by the fractional interests, many of these interests would represent less than one square foot of ground. In early 2002, the Department of the Interior attempted to replicate the audit methodology used by the GAO and to update the GAO report data to assess the continued growth of fractionation.&quot; It found that it increased by more than 40% between 1992 and 2002.

&quot;As an example of continuing fractionation, consider a real tract identified in 1987 in &quot;Hodel v. Irving&quot;, 481 U.S. 704 (1987):

Today, this tract produces $2,000 in income annually and is valued at $22,000. It now has 505 owners but the common denominator used to compute fractional interests has grown to 220,670,049,600,000. If the tract were sold (assuming the 505 owners could agree) for its estimated $22,000 value, the smallest heir would now be entitled to $.00001824.&quot; The administrative costs of handling this tract in 2003 are estimated by the BIA at $42,800.&quot;

Fractionation has become significantly worse. As noted above, in some cases the land is so highly fractionated that it can never be made productive. With such small ownership interests, &quot;it is nearly impossible to obtain the level of consent necessary to lease the land.&quot; &quot;In addition, to manage highly fractionated parcels of land, the government spends more money probating estates, maintaining title records, leasing the land, and attempting to manage and distribute tiny amounts of income to individual owners than is received in income from the land. In many cases, the costs associated with managing these lands can be significantly more than the value of the underlying asset.&quot;

==Criticisms==
Angie Debo&#x27;s, &quot;And Still the Waters Run: The Betrayal of the Five Civilized Tribes&quot; (1940), claimed the allotment policy of the Dawes Act (as later extended to apply to the Five Civilized Tribes through the Dawes Commission and the Curtis Act of 1898) was systematically manipulated to deprive the Native Americans of their lands and resources. Ellen Fitzpatrick claimed that Debo&#x27;s book &quot;advanced a crushing analysis of the corruption, moral depravity, and criminal activity that underlay White administration and execution of the allotment policy.&quot;

<text>The Dingley Act of 1897 (ch. 11, , July 24, 1897), introduced by U.S. Representative Nelson Dingley Jr., of Maine, raised tariffs in United States to counteract the Wilson–Gorman Tariff Act of 1894, which had lowered rates. The bill came into effect under William McKinley the first year that he was in office. The McKinley administration wanted slowly to bring back the protectionism that was proposed by the Tariff of 1890.

Following the election of 1896, McKinley followed through with his promises for protectionism. Congress imposed duties on wool and hides which had been duty-free since 1872. Rates were increased on woollens, linens, silks, china, and sugar (the tax rates for which doubled). The Dingley Tariff remained in effect for twelve years, making it the longest-lasting tariff in U.S. history. It was also the highest in US history, averaging about 52% in its first year of operation. Over the life of the tariff, the rate averaged at around 47%.

The Dingley Act remained in effect until the Payne–Aldrich Tariff Act of 1909.

<text>Hua Mulan () is a legendary Chinese folk heroine from the Northern and Southern dynasties era (4th to 6th century CE) of Chinese history. Scholars generally consider Mulan to be a fictional character. Hua Mulan is depicted in the &quot;Wu Shuang Pu&quot; (, &quot;Table of Peerless Heroes&quot;) by Jin Guliang.

==Overview==
According to legend, Mulan took her aged father&#x27;s place in the conscription for the army by disguising herself as a man. In the story, after prolonged and distinguished military service against nomadic hordes beyond the northern frontier, Mulan is honored by the emperor, but she declines a position of high office. She retires to her hometown, where she is reunited with her family and, much to the astonishment of her comrades, reveals herself as a woman.

==First mentions==
The first written record of Mulan is the Ballad of Mulan, a folk song believed to have been composed during the Northern Wei dynasty (386–535 CE) and included in an anthology of books and songs during the Southern Chen dynasty (557–589 CE). While this anthology is itself lost, significant excerpts, including the Ballad of Mulan, survive in the Song dynasty anthology (). 

The historical setting of the &quot;Ballad of Mulan&quot; is usually the Northern Wei&#x27;s military campaigns against the nomadic Rouran. A later adaptation has Mulan active around the founding of the Tang dynasty ().

The story of Mulan was taken up in a number of later works, including the 17th-century work of historical fiction &quot;&quot;, and many screen and stage adaptations.

==Sources==

The &quot;&quot; was first transcribed in the &quot;Musical Records of Old and New&quot;, a compilation of books and songs by the monk Zhijiang in the Southern Chen dynasty in the 6th century. The earliest extant text of the poem comes from an 11th- or 12th-century anthology known as the &quot;Music Bureau Collection&quot;, whose author, Guo Maoqian, explicitly mentions the &quot;Musical Records of Old and New&quot; as his source for the poem. As a ballad, the lines do not necessarily have equal numbers of syllables. The poem consists of 31 couplets and is mostly composed of five-character phrases, with a few extending to seven or nine.

An adaptation by playwright Xu Wei (d. 1593) dramatized the tale as &quot;The Female Mulan&quot; or, more fully, &quot;The Heroine Mulan Goes to War in Her Father&#x27;s Place&quot;, in two acts. Later, the character of Mulan was incorporated into the &quot;Romance of Sui and Tang&quot;, a novel written by Chu Renhuo ().

Over time, the story of Mulan rose in popularity as a folk tale among the Chinese people.

===Name===
The heroine of the poem is given different family names in different versions of her story. The &quot;Musical Records of Old and New&quot; states Mulan&#x27;s given name is not known and therefore implies Mulan is her surname. As the &quot;Ballad of Mulan&quot; is set in the Northern Wei dynasty when northern China was ruled by ethnic Xianbei, a proto-Mongolic people, there is some evidence that Mulan was not ethnic Han Chinese but Xianbei, who had exclusively compound surnames. Mulan may have been the sinified version of the Xianbei word &quot;umran&quot; which means prosperous.

According to later books such as &quot;Female Mulan&quot;, her family name is Zhu (), while the &quot;Romance of Sui and Tang&quot; says it is Wei (). The family name &quot;Hua&quot; (), which was introduced by Xu Wei, has become the most popular in recent years, in part because of its more poetic meaning and association with the given name &quot;Mulan&quot; (), which literally means &quot;magnolia&quot;.

===Historicity===
Mulan&#x27;s name is included in Yan Xiyuan&#x27;s &quot;One Hundred Beauties&quot;, which describes a number of women from Chinese folklore. It is still unclear whether Mulan was a historical person or just a legend, as her name does not appear in &quot;Exemplary Women&quot;, a collection of biographies of women who lived during Northern Wei dynasty.

Although &quot;The Ballad of Mulan&quot; itself does not expressly indicate the historical setting, the story is commonly attributed to the Northern Wei dynasty due to geographic and cultural references in the ballad. The Northern Wei dynasty was founded by the Tuoba clan of ethnic Xianbei who united northern China in the 4th century CE (Conquest dynasty). The Tuoba Xianbei rulers were themselves nomads from the northern steppes and became sinified as they ruled and settled in northern China. The Tuoba Xianbei took on the Chinese dynasty name &quot;Wei&quot;, changed their own surname from &quot;Tuoba&quot; to &quot;Yuan&quot;, and moved the capital from Pingcheng, modern-day Datong, Shanxi in the northern periphery of Imperial China, to Luoyang, south of the Yellow River, in the Central Plain, the traditional heartland of China. The emperors of the Northern Wei were known both by the sacred Chinese title, &quot;Son of Heaven&quot;, and by &quot;Khagan&quot;, the title of the leader of nomadic kingdoms. &quot;The Ballad of Mulan&quot; refers to the sovereign by both titles. The Northern Wei also adopted the governing institutions of Imperial China, and the office of &quot;shangshulang&quot; () the Khagan offered Mulan is a ministerial position within the &quot;shangshusheng&quot; (), the highest organ of executive power under the emperor. This offering indicates Mulan was trained in the martial arts and literary arts as she was capable of serving as a civilian official charged with issuing and interpreting written government orders.

The Xianbei in China also retained certain nomadic traditions, and Xianbei women were typically skilled horseback riders. Another popular Northern Wei folk poem called &quot;Li Bo&#x27;s Younger Sister&quot; praises Yong Rong, Li Bo&#x27;s younger sister, for her riding and archery skills. &quot;The Ballad of Mulan&quot; may have reflected the gender roles and status of women in nomadic societies.

The Northern Wei was engaged in protracted military conflict with the nomadic Rouran, who frequently raided the northern Chinese frontier to loot and pillage. Northern Wei emperors considered the Rouran to be uncivilized &quot;barbarians&quot; and called them &quot;Ruanruan&quot; () or &quot;wriggling worms&quot;. According to the &quot;Book of Wei&quot;, the dynasty&#x27;s official history, Emperor Taiwu of Northern Wei launched a military expedition in 429 against the Rouran by advancing on the Black Mountain and then extending northward to the Yanran Mountain. Both locations are cited in &quot;The Ballad&quot;. The Black Mountain corresponds to Shahu Mountain (), located southeast of modern-day Hohhot in Inner Mongolia. Yan Mountain, the shorthand for Yanran Mountain (), is now known as the Khangai Mountains of central Mongolia.

The Northern Wei sought to protect the frontier by establishing a string of frontier garrison commands across what is today Inner Mongolia.

== &quot;Ballad of Mulan&quot; ==

Mulan sighs at her loom. The Khagan is mobilizing the military, and her father is named in each of the conscription notices from the emperor. As the eldest child, she decides to take her father&#x27;s place. She buys a fine horse from the eastern market, saddle and stirrup from the western market, bridle and reins from the southern market and a long whip from the northern market.

She bids farewell to her parents in the morning and leaves for the Black Mountain, encamping by the Yellow River in the evening, where she cannot hear the calls of her parents due to the rushing waters; only the sounds of the barbarians&#x27; cavalry in the Yan Mountains. She advances ten thousand &quot;li&quot; to battle as if flying past the mountains. The sound of the sentry gong cuts through the cold night air, and the moonlight reflects off her metal armor. A hundred battles take place, and generals die.

After the ten-year campaign, the veterans return to meet the Son of Heaven (Mandate of Heaven), enthroned in the splendid palace, who confers promotions in rank and prizes of hundreds of thousands. He asks Mulan what she would like. Mulan turns down the high-ranking position of &quot;shangshulang&quot; in the central government, and asks only for a speedy steed to take her home.

Her parents, upon hearing her return, welcome her outside their hometown. Her elder sister puts on her fine dress. Her younger brother sharpens the knife for the swine and sheep. Mulan returns to her room, changes from her tabard into her old clothes. She combs her hair by the window and, before the mirror, fastens golden yellow flowers. Her comrades are shocked to see her. For twelve years of their enlistment together, they hadn&#x27;t realized that she was a woman. Mulan responses:
==&quot;Romance of Sui and Tang&quot;==
Chu Renhuo&#x27;s (c. 1675) provides additional backdrops and plot-twists. Here, Mulan lives under the rule of Heshana Khan of the Western Turkic Khaganate. When the Khan agrees to wage war in alliance with the emergent Tang dynasty, which was poised to conquer all of China, Mulan&#x27;s father Hua Hu () fears he will be conscripted into military service since he only has two daughters and an infant son. Mulan crossdresses as a man and enlists in her father&#x27;s stead. She is intercepted by the forces of the Xia king Dou Jiande and is brought under questioning by the king&#x27;s warrior daughter Xianniang (), who tries to recruit Mulan as a man. Discovering Mulan to be a fellow female warrior, she is so delighted that they become sworn sisters.

In the &quot;Sui Tang Romance&quot;, Mulan comes to a tragic end, a &quot;detail that cannot be found in any previous legends or stories associated Hua Mulan&quot;, and believed to have been interpolated by the author Chu Renho. Xianniang&#x27;s father is vanquished after siding with the enemy of the Tang dynasty, and the two sworn sisters, with knives in their mouths, surrender themselves to be executed in the place of the condemned man. This act of filial piety wins a reprieve from Emperor Taizong of Tang, and the imperial consort, who was birth-mother to the Emperor, bestows money to Mulan to provide for her parents, as well as wedding funds for the princess, who had confessed to having promised herself to general (). In reality, Dou Jiande was executed, but in the novel he lives on as a monk.

Mulan is given leave to journey back to her homeland, and once arrangements were made for Mulan&#x27;s parents to relocate, it is expected that they will all be living in the princess&#x27;s old capital of Leshou (, modern Xian County, Hebei). Mulan is devastated to discover her father has long died and her mother has remarried. According to the novel, Mulan&#x27;s mother was surnamed Yuan (袁) and remarried a man named Wei (魏). Even worse, the Khan has summoned her to the palace to become his concubine.

Rather than to suffer this fate, she dies by suicide. But before she dies, she entrusts an errand to her younger sister, Youlan (), which was to deliver Xianniang&#x27;s letter to her fiancé, Luó Chéng. This younger sister dresses as a man to make her delivery, but her disguise is discovered, and it arouses her recipient&#x27;s amorous attention.

The Mulan character&#x27;s suicide has been described as &quot;baffling&quot;, since she is not in love or engaged to anyone. Some commentators have explained this as an anti-Qing message: the author supposedly wanted to suggest that &quot;even a half-Chinese woman would prefer death by her own hand to serving a foreign ruler&quot;. In the novel, Mulan&#x27;s mother was from the Central Plain of China, but her father was from Hebei during the Northern Wei dynasty and presumably of
Xianbei origin.

<text>Fa Mulan is a fictional character, inspired by a legendary figure, who appears in Walt Disney Pictures&#x27; animated film &quot;Mulan&quot; (1998). Her speaking voice is provided by actress Ming-Na Wen, while singer Lea Salonga provides the character&#x27;s singing voice. Created by author Robert D. San Souci, Mulan is based on the legendary Chinese warrior Hua Mulan from the poem the &quot;Ballad of Mulan&quot;. Her name &quot;Fa Mulan&quot; is inspired by the Yue Chinese name for the character, which is pronounced Fa Muklan. The only child of an aging war veteran, Mulan disregards both tradition and the law by disguising herself as a man in order to enlist herself in the army in lieu of her feeble father.

Disney had originally conceived Mulan as an oppressed young Chinese woman who ultimately elopes to Europe to be with a British prince. However, director Tony Bancroft, who was inspired by the well-being of his own daughters, wanted Mulan to be a different, unique kind of Disney heroine – one who is strong and independent, whose fate does not depend upon a male character. Thus, the relationship between Mulan and Captain Li Shang was relegated to that of a minor subplot, while Mulan&#x27;s bravery and strength were emphasized in order to ensure that she remained the hero of her own story. She became the eighth Disney Princess and the first one who isn&#x27;t actually a princess in her film, as she wasn&#x27;t born of royalty nor did she become one by marrying a prince. While an argument could be made that Pocahontas is still technically a princess since she is a chieftain&#x27;s daughter, Mulan quite literally is not, but is included in the lineup nonetheless. She also became the first one of East Asian descent as well. She is the last Disney Princess to be developed during the Disney Renaissance. Mulan&#x27;s supervising animator was Mark Henn, who deliberately designed the character so that she would appear less feminine than her predecessors.

Reception towards Mulan&#x27;s personality has been generally positive, with critics praising her bravery and heroism. However, her romantic relationship with Shang has been accused of compromising Mulan&#x27;s heroism. Both Wen and Salonga have been awarded Disney Legends for their contributions to the role. Yifei Liu played the live-action version of the character in the 2020 live-action adaptation of the original 1998 film, named Hua Mulan.

==Development==
=== Conception and writing ===
&quot;Mulan&quot; was originally conceived as an animated short in 1994, in which a miserable Chinese girl elopes to the West to be with a British prince. While developing a series of treatments based on traditional stories and folk tales, children&#x27;s book author Robert D. San Souci discovered the &quot;Ballad of Mulan&quot;, an ancient Chinese poem about Hua Mulan – a Chinese woman who replaces her ailing father in the army by disguising herself as a man. Fascinated by Hua Mulan&#x27;s story, San Souci suggested the poem to Disney; the studio hired San Souci himself to write the film&#x27;s treatment and story.

&quot;Mulan&quot; explores the age-old theme of remaining true to oneself, with co-director Tony Bancroft summarizing the character&#x27;s role in the film as &quot;the story of a girl who can&#x27;t help who she is but she exists in a different society that tells her who she is supposed to be.&quot; Because the &quot;Ballad of Mulan&quot; is such a beloved and well-known story, San Souci longed to maintain the character&#x27;s integrity. However, certain creative liberties were taken with the story in regards to Mulan&#x27;s role, such as the character neglecting to ask her parents&#x27; permission prior to enlisting herself in the army. Mulan&#x27;s surname was rendered as the Yue Chinese (aka Cantonese) &quot;Fa&quot;, though this was to pay respect to the poem being originally written in that language. Finally, Mulan&#x27;s true identity is discovered much earlier in the film, soon after the army&#x27;s initial encounter with the enemy, whereas her comrades remain ignorant throughout their entire 12 years at war until after Mulan has returned home.

Unlike preceding traditional Disney animated feature films, the developing romantic relationship between Mulan and Li Shang is treated as more of a subplot as opposed to a traditional central plot, as observed by film critic Andy Klein of Animation World Network. Klein commented, &quot;Mulan isn&#x27;t waiting for her prince to someday come; when he does arrive, having known her primarily as a man, and having learned to admire her for her deeper qualities, the romance is muted and subtle.&quot; Throughout the movie they are constantly working towards helping each other change into better and truer versions of themselves in order to achieve their true potential.

=== Voice ===

Mulan&#x27;s speaking voice is provided by actress Ming-Na Wen. Because the character &quot;represented [traditional] Chinese values&quot; and is depicted as being &quot;dramatic ... close to her father, very respectful,&quot; Bancroft believed that Wen possessed the &quot;perfect&quot; voice for Mulan, which he additionally described as &quot;very Chinese.&quot; Born and raised in Macau, China, Wen was very much familiar with both the legend of Hua Mulan and the &quot;Ballad of Mulan &quot;at the time of her audition for the role, having grown up being read the poem by her mother. Wen explained, &quot;I think every Chinese kid grows up with this story,&quot; additionally likening the poem&#x27;s popularity in China to that of the Western Parson Weems fable in which American president George Washington chops down his father&#x27;s beloved cherry tree.

Mulan served as Wen&#x27;s first voice-acting role. In an interview with IGN, the actress elaborated on the recording process, specifically the fact that she was required to record the majority of the character&#x27;s dialogue in isolation, saying, &quot;I just loved the story so much and identified so much with the character of Mulan it was easy for me. I loved using my imagination. I felt like I was a little kid again, being silly with an imaginary sword and riding on an imaginary horse and talking to an imaginary dragon. So it was a lot of fun for me.&quot; In spite of the fact that, throughout the film, Mulan shares multiple scenes with her guardian, a miniature Chinese dragon named Mushu who is voiced by American actor and comedian Eddie Murphy, Wen and her co-star never actually encountered each other while working on &quot;Mulan &quot;due to the fact that they recorded their respective dialogue at separate times in separate locations.

Upon being cast as Mulan&#x27;s speaking voice, Wen was immediately informed by Disney that she would not be providing the character&#x27;s singing voice. The actress took no offense to this decision, commenting jokingly &quot;I don&#x27;t blame them.&quot; The directors hired Filipina singer and actress Lea Salonga to dub the character&#x27;s respective singing voice, heard in the film&#x27;s songs &quot;Reflection&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ll Make a Man Out of You&quot; and &quot;A Girl Worth Fighting For&quot;, on Wen&#x27;s behalf. According to Thomas S. Hischak, author of the book &quot;Disney Voice Actors: A Biographical Dictionary&quot;, Salonga was originally cast to provide both Mulan&#x27;s speaking and singing voices. However, the directors eventually felt that her attempt at impersonating a man in the form of Mulan&#x27;s male alter-ego &quot;Ping&quot; was rather unconvincing, and ultimately replacing Salonga with Wen. Six years prior to &quot;Mulan&quot;, Salonga provided the singing voice of Princess Jasmine in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Aladdin&quot; (1992) on behalf of American actress Linda Larkin. While auditioning for Mulan, Salonga asked jokingly, &quot;Why do I have to audition? ... I was already a princess before. Wasn&#x27;t that enough?&quot;

=== Characterization and design ===
The film&#x27;s screenplay was constantly being revised and re-written. Naturally, so was Mulan&#x27;s characterization and role in the film. The writers wanted Mulan to represent a &quot;different kind of Disney heroine,&quot; specifically described as one who &quot;didn&#x27;t need a tiara, but was still just as much as graceful, strong, and courageous.&quot; Between the two, Bancroft and his twin brother Tom, an animator who also worked on &quot;Mulan&quot;, have a total of seven daughters. This further inspired the filmmakers to portray Mulan as a unique heroine who is &quot;not another damsel in distress&quot; in favor of having her resemble &quot;a strong female Disney character who would truly be the heroine of her own story&quot; instead, essentially a &quot;female role model. The characteristics of strength and courage were a must for Mulan.&quot; In an interview with &quot;The Christian Post&quot;, Bancroft elaborated on the way in which he, as the film&#x27;s director, continued to consider the well-being of his two young daughters while working on &quot;Mulan&quot;, having &quot;wanted to make a unique heroine that hadn&#x27;t been seen before&quot; and provide for them &quot;someone who would be strong on her own, without a prince saving her.&quot; Addressing the way in which Mulan differs from traditional Disney heroines and princesses, Bancroft explained, &quot;Most Disney heroines have an outside source that comes in and helps them change. Mulan stays consistent. From the first frame all the way through the end of the movie, her personality, her drive it all stays the same.&quot; 
Visually, the animators were influenced by both traditional Chinese and Japanese artwork. In the specific case of Mulan, &quot;The characters&#x27; simple lines ... resemble classic Asian painting&quot;. Chinese artist Chen Yi mentored the animators, &quot;helping [them] to come up with these designs.&quot; Mark Henn served as Mulan&#x27;s supervising animator. Animating the character in her male disguise as &quot;Ping&quot; offered an unprecedented challenge for Henn. In order to solve this unique dilemma, Henn was provided with &quot;the opportunity to adjust her design a little bit so that when she was disguised as Ping, as a soldier, that she was physically a little different in how we drew her than when she was herself as Mulan.&quot; Physically, Mulan was also designed to appear less feminine than preceding traditional Disney animated heroines, specifically Pocahontas from &quot;Pocahontas&quot; (1995) and Esmeralda from &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; (1996), because &quot;you can&#x27;t pass as a man in the army with a Barbie-style figure.&quot;

Henn revealed that he was drawn to &quot;Mulan&#x27;s story [because it] was so unique and compelling that it just captivated me from the beginning&quot;. Animating the characters&#x27; distinct emotions using the traditional Chinese style turned out to be somewhat challenging for Henn. The animator explained, &quot;We don&#x27;t create realism in the sense that if you&#x27;re doing a human character, it&#x27;s not going to look realistic ... the balance is finding an appealing way of drawing using the visual tools that you have in the design to convey the believable emotions that you want to get across.&quot; In addition to Mulan, Henn was also responsible for animating Fa Zhou, Mulan&#x27;s elderly father. He described the complex relationship between the two characters as &quot;the emotional heart of the story&quot;. Fathering one daughter himself, Henn drew inspiration from his own emotions as well as past personal experiences while animating several intimate scenes shared by the two characters.

Several film critics have described Mulan as a tomboy. Andy Patrizio of IGN observed, &quot;In this slightly modernized version of the story, Mulan is something of a rebel and a tomboy. She has no interest in being a good little subservient wife, despite her sighing parents&#x27; wishes.&quot; Jo Johnson, in contribution to the book &quot;Queers in American Popular Culture Volume 1: Film and Television&quot;, wrote that &quot;Unlike other Disney heroines, Mulan is immediately coded as a tomboy,&quot; observing the way in which the character speaks using a full mouth. Johnson additionally noticed several ways in which Mulan&#x27;s design and personality differ from those typically associated with traditional Disney heroines and princesses, citing the character&#x27;s clumsy, awkward demeanor; broad shoulders and muscular limbs; unruly single strand of hair; and choice of everyday attire which usually consists of loose, baggy clothing concealing her &quot;traditionally slim Disney waist.&quot; Additionally, Mulan&#x27;s intelligence has been observed in several professional analyses, with critics often citing the character as &quot;brainy.&quot;

===Films===

====&quot;Mulan&quot;====

The Huns, led by Shan Yu, invade China by breaching the Great Wall. The Chinese emperor orders that the army protect his citizens over himself, general mobilization, issuing a conscription that one man from each family to join the Chinese army. After Mulan&#x27;s meeting with the matchmaker goes horribly awry, Chi Fu arrives at her home to enlist her father. Although she protests knowing her veteran father can not survive another war, Mulan is silenced by both Chi Fu and her father. That evening, Mulan takes her father&#x27;s old armor and disguises herself as a boy named Ping, enlisting in the army on his behalf. Upon learning of Mulan&#x27;s departure, the ancestors order the small dragon Mushu, a disgraced former guardian, to awaken the &quot;great stone dragon&quot; so that he may retrieve Mulan, only for Mushu to destroy the statue. Mushu decides to join Mulan in the army and help train her in the hopes that the ancestors will crown him a guardian once again.

Reporting to the training camp, Mulan is able to pass as a man, although her military skills are initially lacking. Mushu provides clumsy guidance to Mulan on how to behave like a man. Under the command of Captain Li Shang, she and her fellow recruits Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po, gradually become trained warriors. Desiring to see Mulan succeed, Mushu creates a fake order from Shang&#x27;s father, General Li, ordering Shang to follow the main imperial army into the mountains. The reinforcements set out, but arrive at a burnt-out encampment, where they discover that General Li and his troops have been massacred by the Huns.

As the reinforcements solemnly leave the mountains, they are ambushed by the Huns, but Mulan cleverly uses a cannon to cause an avalanche, which buries most of the invaders. An enraged Shan Yu slashes her in the chest, and after the avalanche subsides, her deception is revealed when the wound is bandaged.

Instead of executing Mulan as the law requires, Shang spares her life, but nonetheless expels her from the army. Mulan is left to follow alone as the recruits depart for the imperial city to report the news of the Huns&#x27; destruction. However, it is discovered that six Hun warriors, including Shan Yu, have survived the avalanche, and Mulan catches sight of them as they make their way to the city, intent on capturing the emperor.

At the imperial city, Mulan is unable to convince Shang about Shan Yu&#x27;s survival; the Huns capture the emperor, and seize the palace. With Mulan&#x27;s help, Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po pose as concubines, and are able to enter the palace. With the help of Shang, they defeat Shan Yu&#x27;s men; as Shang prevents Shan Yu from assassinating the Emperor, Mulan lures the Hun leader onto the roof, where she engages him in single combat. Meanwhile, acting on Mulan&#x27;s instructions and signal, Mushu fires a large skyrocket at Shan Yu. The rocket strikes, and propels him into a fireworks launching tower, where he dies in the resulting explosion.

Mulan is praised by the Emperor and the assembled inhabitants of the city, who bow to her in an unprecedented honor. While she accepts the crest of the Emperor, and the sword of Shan Yu as gifts, she politely declines his offer to be his advisor, and asks to return to her family.

Mulan returns home, where she presents these gifts to her father, who is overjoyed to have Mulan back safely. Having become enamored with Mulan, Shang soon arrives under the pretext of returning her helmet, but accepts the family&#x27;s invitation to stay for dinner. Mushu is reinstated as a Fa family guardian by the ancestors amid a returning celebration. When Mulan thanks Mushu, she kisses him on the forehead, followed by her dog, Little Brother, and a herd of chickens bursting into the Temple, with a Great Ancestor calling Mushu&#x27;s name, ending the film.

====&quot;Mulan II&quot;====

One whole month after the events of the original movie, Mulan and Li Shang prepare to marry but are distracted by a task from the Emperor, who wants his three daughters escorted to their own marriage ceremony. Their romantic relationship becomes somewhat strained during the trip, as the romantic couple has differing views on various issues. Meanwhile, Mushu realizes that if Mulan marries Shang, she will not need him anymore as her guardian spirit, and decides to trick the two into breaking up. When bandits attack, Mulan and Shang fight them off, but Mulan is devastated when Shang is seemingly killed trying to save her. To make sure the three princesses are not forced to marry against their will, Mulan takes their place marrying the eldest son of the ruler of the neighboring land. Shang survives the accident and arrives in time to stop the wedding but ultimately Mulan is saved by Mushu who, posing as the mighty Golden Dragon of Unity, frees the three princesses from their vows, and marries Mulan and Li Shang himself causing Mulan to forgive him for his actions. Afterwards, Mulan informs Li Shang of Mushu&#x27;s existence and he combines the temples of his family and hers, allowing Mushu to keep his position.

====&quot;Ralph Breaks the Internet&quot;====
Mulan, alongside other Disney Princesses, appeared in the film &quot;Ralph Breaks the Internet&quot;, as was announced at the 2017 D23 Expo.

==== Live-action film ====

Yifei Liu portrays Mulan in a live-action adaptation of the 1998 animated film. The character&#x27;s journey through the live-action movie is mostly the same as the animated film. Although she does have a sister, who was not featured in the original movie, and she reconsiders joining the Emperor&#x27;s Guard after returning home. A phoenix also serves as a guardian to her instead of Mushu.

====&quot;Once Upon a Studio&quot;====
Mulan appears in the short film &quot;Once Upon a Studio&quot;. She sings with Snow White and Asha near the end of &quot;When You Wish Upon a Star&quot; and sits next to the Prince in the group photo.

=== &quot;Disney Princess&quot; franchise ===
Mulan is the eighth official member of the Disney Princess franchise, a media franchise marketed towards young girls. For children, Mulan demonstrates the positive aspects of never giving up, not being restricted to gender roles and the importance of family and honor. These aspects of the film are more in keeping with a traditional Chinese perspective on cultural value, such as the importance of family and honor. On the official Disney Princess website, the character&#x27;s brief biography reads, &quot;Mulan is a loving girl who is always brave and bold. When her country needs it most, she disguises herself as a man and goes off to fight. She uses courage and determination to win the day.&quot; Although Mulan is a member of the Disney Princess franchise, she is not a legitimate princess in the traditional sense, as she was neither born the daughter of a king or queen, nor does she become princess consort by marrying a prince. She is the franchise&#x27;s first and currently only East Asian member.

===Attractions===

Mulan appears regularly for meet-and-greets, parades and shows at the Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, including at the Chinese Pavilion at Epcot. Mulan and Mushu, as a kite, make cameo appearances in the Hong Kong Disneyland and Disneyland Resort versions of It&#x27;s a Small World. In most of the parks she is most commonly found alongside Li Shang and Mushu in Adventureland. As a tribute, there is a portrait of her along with the other Disney Princesses at the Princess Fairytale Hall at the Magic Kingdom.

On the Disney Cruise Line ships and in Hong Kong Disneyland, Mulan and Li Shang appear in the stage show &quot;The Golden Mickeys&quot;. Mulan is also known to come out for meet-and-greets on the ships as well. She is also featured in the Disney on Ice shows &quot;Princess Classics&quot; and &quot;Princess Wishes&quot;.

===Television===
Mulan makes cameo appearances in the &quot;House of Mouse&quot; television series and the direct-to-video release &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse&quot;. She was scheduled to appear in the second installment of the &quot;Disney Princess Enchanted Tales&quot; series of DVDs along with Cinderella. It was to premiere in 2008 but was cancelled due to poor sales of the first DVD.

In August 2014, Ming-Na Wen and Lea Salonga reprise their roles as Mulan for the first time since &quot;Mulan II&quot; in the Disney Channel show &quot;Sofia the First&quot;. In the episode &quot;Princesses to the Rescue,&quot; Mulan reminds Sofia and her friends Amber and Jun they are &quot;Stronger Than They Know&quot; in song. Mulan is the 7th Disney princess to appear on the show.

===Video games===
Mulan appears as a playable character in &quot;Disney&#x27;s Story Studio: Mulan&quot;, an action video game released in December 1999 by Disney Interactive Studios exclusively for the video game console Sony PlayStation. Loosely based on the plot of the original animated film, the video game&#x27;s concept and premise revolves around &quot;Players ... assum[ing] the role of Mulan on her quest to recover the missing scrolls.&quot; Mulan also appears as a playable character in &quot;Disney&#x27;s Mulan&quot;, a similar video game released the previous year on October 10, 1998, by THQ for Game Boy.

&quot;Disney Infinity 3.0&quot; has Mulan as one of the playable characters and figures.

Mulan is a playable character to unlock for a limited time in &quot;Disney Magic Kingdoms&quot;. She is also an unlockable racer in Disney Speedstorm.

====&quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; series====
Mulan appears in the Square Enix and Disney video game &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot; in the Land of the Dragons world, with Ming-Na Wen reprising her role. She aids Sora in battle, taking the place of either Donald or Goofy. She uses a &quot;jian&quot; called &quot;Sword of the Ancestor&quot; for regular combat, and her combination attacks include Red Rocket and other fire attacks, thanks to Mushu. She goes under her pseudonym (Ping) for the majority of Sora&#x27;s first visit to her world, which follows the storyline of the film, but has abandoned it by the time of their second visit, which follows a new story where they come into conflict with Xigbar and the Storm Rider Heartless.

===Books===

====&quot;Reflection: A Twisted Tale&quot;====
In the fourth book in the &quot;Twisted Tales&quot; series, author Elizabeth Lim asks the question &quot;What if Mulan had to journey to the Underworld?&quot; In the book, Shang dies and Mulan journeys to the Chinese underworld to save Shang&#x27;s soul and bring him back to life. The book draws heavily on Chinese mythology.

==Reception and legacy==

=== Critical response ===
Reception towards Mulan&#x27;s personality and characterization have been generally positive. &quot;Time Out&quot; hailed Mulan as &quot;A feisty young go-getter [who] rises above the male-dominated world in which she lives.&quot; Ken Fox of &quot;TV Guide&quot; wrote, &quot;Intelligent and fiercely independent, Mulan ... runs afoul of social expectations that a woman will be always obedient and duty-bound to her husband.&quot; Bridget Byrne of &quot;Boxoffice&quot; wrote that &quot;Mulan ... has pride, charm, spirit and aesthetic appeal which prevents her from being upstaged by the vigorous and exciting action in which she participates.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot;&#x27;s Todd McCarthy praised the character for inspiring &quot;a turn of the circle from such age-old Disney classics ... in which passive heroines were rescued by blandly noble princes.&quot; McCarthy continued, &quot;Here, it&#x27;s the girl who does the rescuing, saving not only the prince but the emperor himself from oblivion, and this in a distant culture where women were expected to obey strictly prescribed rules.&quot; Similarly, Margaret A. McGurk of &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot; lauded Mulan for &quot;solv[ing] her &quot;G.I. Jane&quot; dilemma by proving that brains can do more than brawn.&quot; Hailing the character as &quot;Among the strongest heroines in Walt&#x27;s cartoon canon,&quot; Ian Freer of &quot;Empire&quot; enthused, &quot;Mulan&#x27;s engaging mixture of vulnerability and derring-do becomes incredibly easy to root for.&quot; Hollis Chacona of &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; dubbed Mulan a &quot;winning protagonist.&quot; Likewise, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;&#x27; Kenneth Turan wrote, &quot;As a vivacious rebel who has to be true to herself no matter what, Mulan is an excellent heroine, perfect for the young female demographic the studio is most anxious to attract&quot;, additionally calling her a &quot;more likable and resourceful role model than Pocahontas&quot;.

Although largely well-liked, Mulan&#x27;s characterization has drawn some mild criticism and speculation, inspiring a series of generally mixed to positive reviews from some film critics. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;&#x27;s Owen Gleiberman wrote, &quot;Far more than &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; or the stolidly virtuous &quot;Pocahontas&quot;, &quot;Mulan&quot; showcases a girl who gets to use her &quot;wits&quot; ... a testament to the power of mind over brawn.&quot; However, Gleiberman continued, &quot;&quot;Mulan&quot; finally falls a notch short of Disney&#x27;s best ... because the heroine&#x27;s empowerment remains ... an emotionally isolated quest.&quot; Similarly, Moira Macdonald of &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; hailed Mulan as &quot;a strong, engaging character who, unlike many of her Disney counterparts, needs no one to rescue her from danger,&quot; while questioning her personality, asking, &quot;was it really necessary to bestow Mulan with self-esteem problems? Because she seems so confident and intelligent, her sad statement that she wants to &#x27;see something worthwhile&#x27; in the mirror comes as a bit of a shock.&quot;

Critics were not unanimous in their praise. &quot;The Phoenix&quot;&#x27;s Jeffrey Gantz felt that character was unoriginal, inaccurate and Westernized, writing, &quot;[her] costumes (particularly the kimono and obi Mulan wears to the Matchmaker) and hairdos look Japanese ... Give Mulan Native American features and you have Pocahontas.&quot; Similarly, James Berardinelli of &quot;ReelViews&quot; felt that the character&#x27;s depiction was too &quot;familiar,&quot; reviewing, &quot;Although she looks different from Ariel, Belle, Jasmine, and Pocahontas, Mulan is very much the same type of individual: a woman with a strong, independent streak who is unwilling to bend to the customs of her culture, which decree that the role of the female is to be ornamental. The film isn&#x27;t very subtle in reinforcing the idea of equality between the sexes&quot;. Additionally, some critics, such as Alex von Tunzelmann of &quot;The Guardian&quot;, have criticized Mulan for her violence, writing, &quot;Disney struggles to make Mulan both a killer and a heroine ... Gingerly, the film attempts to tread a middle path, implying that Mulan annihilates most of the Hun army by causing an avalanche, and having her dispatch Shan Yu with a load of fireworks. Very pretty. But still technically killing.&quot; However, von Tunzelmann did conclude more positively, &quot;as Disney heroines go, Mulan herself is a clear improvement on the standard-issue drippy princess.&quot;

Liu&#x27;s portrayal as Mulan in the 2020 film was generally well received by critics. Richard Roeper of &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; described Liu&#x27;s performance as &quot;star-turning&quot; as well as &quot;a boundaries-shattering, stereotype-defying hero-warrior for her time and for ours.&quot; Writing for &quot;IndieWire&quot;, Kate Erbland found Liu, &quot;engaging&quot; as Mulan and adding, &quot;she delivers, easily inhabiting both the reticent, shy Mulan and her bombastic evolution into unmitigated badass.&quot; Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; wrote, &quot;Liu is so strong in the role of Mulan that it&#x27;s only later that you might realize that you were not watching Mulan herself, but someone giving an exceptional performance in a difficult part. In addition to the challenge of portraying Mulan&#x27;s journey from insecurity to glorious attainment, there were the physical rigors, which Liu had to accomplish with balletic grace.&quot; In her review for &quot;London Evening Standard&quot;, Charlotte O&#x27;Sullivan said Liu played, &quot;a Mulan whose fighting skills — and emotional life — dazzle. Liu often looks 13, but is actually 33. She has the kind of face you never get bored of. There&#x27;s something Meryl Streep-y about her soulfulness and all her moves are magical.&quot; While Christy Lemire of &quot;RogerEbert.com&quot; wrote, &quot;Liu&#x27;s performance might have been more powerful if she&#x27;d been a bit more emotive&quot;, she still overall described it as &quot;lovely&quot; and that &quot;the steeliness and physicality she displays make her a convincing fighter.&quot;

==== Relationship with Shang ====
Unlike the generally positive reviews received by Mulan, critical reception towards the character&#x27;s romantic relationship with Li Shang has been largely negative, drawing much speculation from critics who accused &quot;Mulan&quot; of having &quot;a typical girl-hooks-up-with-boy ending.&quot; Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; observed, &quot;The message here is standard feminist empowerment: Defy the matchmaker, dress as a boy, and choose your own career. But &quot;Mulan&quot; has it both ways, since inevitably Mulan&#x27;s heart goes pitty-pat over Shang, the handsome young captain she&#x27;s assigned to serve under. The movie breaks with the tradition in which the male hero rescues the heroine, but is still totally sold on the Western idea of romantic love.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot;&#x27; Janet Maslin negatively opined, &quot;For all of Mulan&#x27;s courage and independence in rebelling against the matchmakers, this is still enough of a fairy tale to need Mr. Right.&quot;

Citing Mulan&#x27;s relationship with Shang as an example of sexism, a film critic writing for &quot;Teen Ink&quot; wrote:

Betsy Wallace of Common Sense Media observed that Mulan &quot;doesn&#x27;t fit the princess mold, and most moviegoers had never heard of her.&quot; Conclusively, Wallace wrote, &quot;it&#x27;s too bad that in the end she still needs to be married off to a &#x27;Prince Charming&#x27; who saves the day.&quot; In contribution to the book &quot;Beyond Adaptation: Essays on Radical Transformations of Original Works&quot;, Lan Dong wrote, &quot;Even though Mulan achieves success after she resumes her female self ... it is compromised by Mulan and Li Shang&#x27;s potential engagement at the end of the film.&quot;

=== Cultural significance and accolades ===
Mulan is culturally recognized for her unique role in &quot;Mulan &quot;specifically in regards to the character&#x27;s heroism, ethnicity and disinterest in romance, serving as a departure from traditional Disney heroines and princesses because she &quot;challenged gender stereotypes and offered up an animated Disney experience that isn&#x27;t princess-centric&quot; as &quot;one of the few strong, self-propelled female characters that Disney has.&quot; Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times &quot;observed the way in which Mulan&#x27;s role in the film as &quot;an independent, not completely boy-crazy heroine is somewhat new for Disney.&quot; According to Sara Veal of &quot;The Jakarta Post&quot;, Mulan &quot;promotes self-reliance, determination and is uninterested in marriage or romance ... the film ends on her saving her country, rather than a romantic resolution.&quot; Succeeding non-white Disney Princesses Jasmine and Pocahontas, Mulan&#x27;s characterization as Disney&#x27;s first East Asian princess assisted in the diversification of the Disney Princess franchise, introducing &quot;Disney princesses ... portrayed as women of color.&quot; Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; commented, &quot;Mulan ... makes a feisty prefeminist,&quot; continuing, &quot;She doesn&#x27;t swoon over Captain Shang, the hunky officer ... which leaves Shang ... frustrated ... Mulan, let the record show, does not put out.&quot; &quot;PopMatters&quot;″ Jesse Hassenger wrote that unlike other Disney films, &quot;Mulan holds the advantage of a smart, strong heroine—not just a superhot princess figure.&quot; Ryan Mazie of Box Office Prophets felt that Mulan &quot;might be the most important and forward-thinking Disney Princess movie made up until that point where the female character solely takes control over her own destiny without the aid of a mighty Prince.&quot;

In 2012, CNN&#x27;s Stephanie Goldberg recognized Mulan as one of Disney&#x27;s bravest and most heroic animated heroines to-date in her article &quot;&quot;Brave&quot;&#x27;s Merida and other animated heroines,&quot; writing, &quot;Mulan bent traditional gender roles when she took her father&#x27;s place in the Chinese army.&quot; Similarly, in 2013, Mulan was ranked the greatest animated Disney heroine according to a poll conducted by Jim Vejvoda of IGN.

In 1999, &quot;Mulan&quot;&#x27;s theme song &quot;Reflection&quot;, performed by Mulan, was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song at the 56th Golden Globe Awards, but ultimately lost to Celine Dion and Andrea Bocelli&#x27;s &quot;The Prayer&quot; from &quot;Quest for Camelot&quot; (1998). &quot;Reflection&quot; is often credited with establishing the successful musical career of American recording artist Christina Aguilera, who famously recorded a pop rendition of the ballad prior to the release of her platinum-selling self-titled debut album in 1999, on which the song is featured. Additionally, the song peaked at number nineteen on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Contemporary chart. In 2011, Salonga was honored with a Disney Legends award in commemoration of her role as Mulan&#x27;s singing voice. Additionally, Salonga performed a live rendition of &quot;Reflection&quot; at the ceremony. Ming-Na Wen was also named a Disney Legend in 2019 for her role as the speaking voice of Mulan.

=== Redesign controversy ===

The 2013 Disney princess redesigns portrayed Mulan with features that differ from her film appearance. The artwork featured Mulan with blue eyes, bigger lips, noticeably lighter skin, and golden clothing which does not resemble any outfit she has worn in the film. Her new appearance has caused an uproar due to the whitewash of her character. This was particularly troubling as Mulan is one of the few princesses of color. Shavon L. McKinstry of &quot;SPARK Movement&quot; writes that Mulan&#x27;s redesign &quot;seem to be directly counter to her personality and character in her film&quot;, and also notes how all the princesses of color have been &quot;noticeably pushed to the back or left out completely&quot; from the new Disney merchandise which featured the redesigns.

McKinstry argues that Disney &quot;prefers to portray one demographic of princess, simultaneously alienating so much of their fanbase&quot;, pointing out that of the &quot;ten Disney Princesses in the brand, six are white&quot;. The importance of Mulan and other non-white princesses can be seen in the 2009 study of the effects of children&#x27;s cartoons on the body image of young girls by doctors Sharon Hayes and Stacey Tantleff-Dunn. The study revealed that in the group of girls ranging from 3 to 6 years old, 30.6% of the group would change their physical appearance if they could. Of these respondents, over half would change their hair and over a quarter would change something about their body, such as skin color. Of all girls surveyed, 8% said they would have to change their hair or skin color to become a princess, stating things like they would &quot;change from brown skin to white skin&quot;, for example. The interviewed group was predominantly white.

Disney has since altered the coloration in Mulan&#x27;s design by changing the blue eye highlight to brown, darkening the color of her skin, and changing her clothing to better resemble her attire in the film.

<text>The Foraker Act, , officially known as the [[Organic Act]] of 1900, is a United States federal law that established civilian (albeit limited popular) government on the island of Puerto Rico, which had recently become a possession of the United States as a result of the Spanish–American War. Section VII of the Foraker Act also established Puerto Rican citizenship and extended American nationality to Puerto Ricans. President William McKinley signed the act on April 12, 1900 and it became known as the &quot;Foraker Act&quot; after its sponsor, Ohio Senator Joseph B. Foraker. Its main author has been identified as Secretary of War Elihu Root.

The new government had a governor and an 11-member executive council appointed by the President of the United States, a House of Representatives with 35 elected members, a judicial system with a Supreme Court and a United States District Court, and a non-voting Resident Commissioner in Congress.

The executive council was all appointed: five individuals were selected from Puerto Rico residents while the rest were from those in top cabinet positions, including attorney general and chief of police (also appointed by the president). The Insular Supreme Court was also appointed. In addition, all federal laws of the United States were to be in effect on the island. The first civil governor of the island under the Foraker Act was Charles H. Allen, inaugurated on May 1, 1900, in San Juan, Puerto Rico. This law was superseded in 1917 by the Jones–Shafroth Act.

==Synopsis==

&quot;2&quot; Required that the same tariffs, customs, and duties be levied collected and paid upon all articles imported into Puerto Rico from ports other than those of the United States which are required by law to be collected upon importation into the United States from foreign countries.

&quot;3&quot; Implemented a temporary tariff on goods transferred between Puerto Rico and the United States. This tariff was set to expire either upon the implementation of local taxation by the Legislature of Puerto Rico sufficient to &quot;meet the necessities of the government&quot; or on the first day of March 1902.

&quot;4&quot; Provided that the tariff collected under section 2 would be placed into a fund and held in trust for the benefit of the people of Puerto Rico until the legislature was fully established. After the establishment of the new government, the funds would be transferred to the local treasury.

&quot;6&quot; Established the capital of Puerto Rico as the city of San Juan and established that the seat of government would be maintained there.

&quot;7&quot; Established that residents of Puerto Rico who were Spanish Citizens who decide to remain in Puerto Rico until the 11th day of April 1899 and their children would be considered citizens of Puerto Rico and be entitled to the protection of the United States. A provision was also made for residents who wanted to remain citizens of Spain.

&quot;11&quot; Provided for the replacement of Spanish currency on the island with US Dollars. Also established that all debts previously payable in Puerto Rican currency would henceforth be payable with US Dollars.

&quot;13&quot; Provided a mechanism to transfer all property held by the United States Government as ceded by Spain to the newly established government of Puerto Rico upon its establishment.

&quot;14&quot; Established that the statutes of the United States would apply if applicable to the citizens of Puerto Rico with the exception of internal revenue laws.

&quot;15&quot; Enabled the newly formed government to amend or repeal any law that was implemented in the course of the transition.

&quot;16&quot; Established a judicial system similar to that of the United States and provided that all government officials take an oath to support both the constitution of the United States and the laws of Puerto Rico.

&quot;17&quot; Established a chief executive with the title of governor who is appointed by the President of the United States with the advice and consent of the United States Senate for a term of four years.

&quot;18&quot; Established an executive council for the Governor of Puerto Rico that is appointed by the President of the United States with the advice and consent of the United States Senate for a term of four years.

&quot;27&quot; Established a bicameral legislative body with one house consisting of the executive council as established in &quot;18&quot; and the other consisting of 35 elected members serving a term of two years. The territory was to be split into seven districts.

&quot;28,29&quot; Provided for the general election of members of the legislative body.

&quot;30&quot; Established the requirements for office in the legislative body.

&quot;31&quot; Defined the mechanisms by which bills become law. A bill can be proposed in either house but must be passed by a majority vote in both houses to become a law. A bill that is passed by both houses is presented to the Governor for his signature. Upon the signature of the governor, the bill becomes law. If the governor does not sign the bill or vetoes it, the legislature can override the veto with a 2/3rd majority vote. Requires that all bills passed by the legislative body be reported to the United States Congress and enables the United States Congress to annul them.

&quot;33&quot; Provided for the transition of then existing court system unto the official court system. Provided for the nomination of the chief justice by the President of the United States with the advice and consent of the United States Senate.

&quot;34&quot; Created the United States District of Puerto Rico and established a district judge to be appointed by the President of the United States with the advice and consent of the United States Senate for a term of four years.

&quot;38&quot; Prevented export duties from being levied and collected. Provided that the legislative body may implement taxes for the general purposes of government, protecting the public credit, and reimbursing the United States government for funds expended out of the emergency fund of the War Department for relief of the industrial situation caused by the hurricane of August 8, 1899. Prevented the government of Puerto Rico and all of its municipalities from entering into debt in excess of seven percent of the aggregate tax value of its property.

&quot;39&quot; Created the position of Resident Commissioner to the United States with a term of two years.

&quot;40&quot; Created a three-member commission consisting of three citizens of Puerto Rico and appointed by the President of the United States with the advice and consent of the United States Senate. The commission was tasked to compile and revise the laws of Puerto Rico as well as the codes of procedure and systems of municipal government to provide for &quot;a simple, harmonious, and economical government&quot;, establish justice and secure its prompt and efficient administration, inaugurate a general system of education and public instruction, provide buildings and funds therefore, equalize and simplify taxation and all the methods of raising revenue, and make all other provisions that may be necessary to secure and extend the benefits of a republican form of government to all the inhabitants of Puerto Rico. The final report of this committee was to be presented to the United States Congress within a year of the passing of the act.

<text>The Gold Standard Act was an Act of the United States Congress, signed by President William McKinley and effective on March 14, 1900, defining the United States dollar by gold weight and requiring the United States Treasury to redeem, on demand and in gold coin only, paper currency the Act specified.

The Act formalized the American gold standard that the Coinage Act of 1873, which demonetized silver, and the Resumption Act of 1875, which made all legal tender notes redeemable in gold at the Treasury, had established by default. Before and after the Act, silver currency including silver certificates and the silver dollar circulated at face value as fiat currency not redeemable for gold.

The Act fixed the value of one dollar at 25.8 grains of 90% pure gold, equivalent to about $20.67 per troy ounce, very near its historic value. American circulating gold coins of the period comprised an alloy of 90% gold and 10% copper for durability. After the realigning 1932 United States elections following the onset of the Great Depression, the gold standard was abandoned from March 1933, and the Act abrogated, by a coordinated series of policy changes including executive orders by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, new laws, and U.S. Supreme Court rulings known as the &quot;Gold Clause Cases&quot; narrowly upheld the Roosevelt administration&#x27;s policies.

After World War II international agreements comprising the Bretton Woods system formally restored foreign central banks&#x27; ability to exchange United States dollars for gold at a fixed price. World trade growth increasingly stressed this system, which was abandoned in the Nixon shock of 1971. Attempts to reform the Bretton Woods system quickly proved unworkable and failed. All modern currencies thus became fiat currencies freely floating and subject to market forces despite capital controls imposed by some central banks, with gold as a commodity.

<text>Mulan is a 1998 American animated musical coming-of-age action-adventure film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation for Walt Disney Pictures. Based on the Chinese legend of Hua Mulan, the film was directed by Barry Cook and Tony Bancroft and produced by Pam Coats, from a screenplay by Rita Hsiao, Chris Sanders, Philip LaZebnik, and the writing team of Raymond Singer and Eugenia Bostwick-Singer, and a story by Robert D. San Souci. Ming-Na Wen, Eddie Murphy, Miguel Ferrer, and BD Wong star in the English version as Mulan, Mushu, Shan Yu, and Captain Li Shang, respectively, while Jackie Chan provided the voice of Li Shang for the Chinese dubs of the film. The film&#x27;s plot takes place in China during an unspecified Imperial dynasty, where Fa Mulan, daughter of aged warrior Fa Zhou, impersonates a man to take her father&#x27;s place during a general conscription to counter a Hun invasion.

&quot;Mulan&quot; was the first of three features produced primarily at the Disney animation studio at Disney-MGM Studios (now Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios) in Bay Lake, Florida. Development for the film began in 1994, when a number of artistic supervisors were sent to China to receive artistic and cultural inspiration.

&quot;Mulan&quot; premiered at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles on June 5, 1998, and was released in the United States on June 19. The film was well received by critics and the public, who praised the animation, plot, characters (particularly the title character), and musical score. It grossed over $304 million worldwide against a production budget of $90 million. It earned a Golden Globe and Academy Award nomination and won several Annie Awards, including Best Animated Feature. It was then followed by a direct-to-video sequel, &quot;Mulan II&quot; in 2004. A live-action remake directed by Niki Caro was released on September 4, 2020.

==Plot==
The Huns, led by the ruthless Shan Yu, invade Han China by breaching the Great Wall. The Emperor orders a general mobilization, with conscription notices requiring one man from each family to join the Imperial Army. Fa Mulan, an adventurous young woman, hopes to bring honor to her family. She is arranged to meet a matchmaker to demonstrate her fitness as a future wife, but is deemed a disgrace after several mishaps.

Fa Zhou, Mulan&#x27;s elderly father and a renowned military veteran, is conscripted. Mulan tries dissuading him from going, but he insists that he must do his duty. Fearing for his life, she cuts her hair and takes her father&#x27;s sword and armor, disguising herself as a man so that she can enlist in his stead. Quickly learning of her departure, Mulan&#x27;s grandmother prays to the family&#x27;s ancestors for Mulan&#x27;s safety. In the family&#x27;s temple, the spirits of the ancestors are awakened by Mushu, a small red dragon who is a disgraced former family guardian. The &quot;Great Ancestor&quot; decides that the powerful stone dragon guardian should guide Mulan, and sends Mushu to wake him. After accidentally destroying the guardian&#x27;s statue, Mushu decides to redeem himself to the ancestors by personally aiding Mulan.

Reporting to the training camp, Mulan passes as a man named &quot;Fa Ping&quot;, with Mushu providing encouragement and clumsy guidance throughout her deception. Under the command of Captain Li Shang, she and her fellow recruits—including three named Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po—gradually become trained soldiers. The Emperor&#x27;s belligerent counsel, Chi-Fu, threatens to dissuade the Emperor from allowing Shang&#x27;s men to fight. Mushu then writes a fake letter from Shang&#x27;s father, General Li, ordering Shang to follow the main imperial army into the mountains. The reinforcements set out and discover that the Huns have slaughtered Li and his troops.

As the soldiers march up a mountain pass, the Huns ambush them. Mulan uses a Huolongchushui cannon to trigger an avalanche and bury the Huns, but is badly injured. Shang and the soldiers discover Mulan&#x27;s true gender while her wound is bandaged. Instead of executing Mulan as the law requires, Shang spares her life and expels her from the army before departing for the Imperial City to report the Huns&#x27; defeat. Mulan, however, later discovers Shan Yu and several of his warriors have survived.

Mulan travels to the city to warn Shang just as the Huns seize the palace and take the Emperor hostage. In the ensuing fight, Shan Yu&#x27;s men are quickly defeated and Mulan lures Shan Yu onto the roof, and ultimately pins him down with his own sword. Guided by Mulan, Mushu uses a skyrocket to propel Shan Yu into a fireworks launching tower, killing him. The Emperor and the city&#x27;s assembled inhabitants praise her for having saved them, and they bow to her in honor. She accepts the Emperor&#x27;s crest and Shan Yu&#x27;s sword as gifts but declines his offer to join the royal council. Mulan returns home and presents these gifts to her father, but he ignores them, happy to have her back. Having become enamored with Mulan, Shang also arrives and accepts her invitation to stay for dinner. Mushu is reinstated as a Fa family guardian as the ancestors celebrate.

==Production==
===Development===
In 1989, Walt Disney Feature Animation Florida had opened with 40 to 50 employees, with its original purpose to produce cartoon shorts and featurettes. However, by late 1993, following several animation duties on &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, &quot;Aladdin&quot;, and &quot;The Lion King&quot;, Disney executives were convinced to allow the Feature Animation Florida studios to produce their first independent film. Around that same time, Disney Feature Animation developed an interest in Asian-themed legends, beginning with the optioning of several books by children&#x27;s book author Robert D. San Souci, who had a consulting relationship with Disney executive Jay Dyer. Also around that time, a short straight-to-video film titled &quot;China Doll&quot; about an oppressed and miserable Chinese girl who is whisked away by a British Prince Charming to happiness in the West was in development. Thomas Schumacher asked San Souci if he had any additional stories, in response to which San Souci turned in a manuscript of a book based on the Chinese poem &quot;The Song of Fa Mu Lan&quot;. Ultimately, Disney decided to combine the two separate projects.

Following the opening of the Feature Animation Florida studios, Barry Cook, who had served as a special-effects animator since 1982, had directed the Roger Rabbit cartoon &quot;Trail Mix-Up&quot; produced at the satellite studio. At a lunch invitation with Thomas Schumacher, Cook was offered two projects in development: a Scottish folk tale with a dragon or &quot;Mulan&quot;. Knowledgeable about the existence of dragons in Chinese mythology, Cook suggested adding a dragon to &quot;Mulan&quot;, in which a week later, Schumacher urged Cook to drop the Scottish project and accept &quot;Mulan&quot; as his next project. Following this, Cook was immediately assigned as the initial director of the project, and cited influences from Charlie Chaplin and David Lean during production. While working as an animator on the gargoyles for &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot;, Tony Bancroft was offered to co-direct the film following a recommendation from Rob Minkoff, co-director of &quot;The Lion King&quot;, to Schumacher, in which he accepted. He joined the creative team by early 1995.

In 1994, the production team sent a select group of artistic supervisors to China for three weeks to take photographs and drawings of local landmarks for inspiration; and to soak up local culture. Key members of the creative team at the time—Pam Coats, Barry Cook, Ric Sluiter, Robert Walker, and Mark Henn—were invited to travel to China as a research trip to study the landscape, people, and history of the original legend. From June 17 to July 2, 1994, the research trip flew to Beijing, China, which is where Coats became inspired by the placement of flags on the Great Wall. They also toured Datong, Luoyang, Xi&#x27;an, Jiayuguan, Dunhuang, and Guilin.

===Writing===
In its earliest stages, the story was originally conceived as a &quot;Tootsie&quot;–inspired romantic comedy film where Mulan, who was a misfit tomboy who loves her father, is betrothed to Shang, whom she has not met. On her betrothal day, her father Fa Zhou carves her destiny on a stone tablet in the family temple, which she shatters in anger, running away to forge her own destiny. In November 1993, Chris Sanders, who had just finished storyboard work on &quot;The Lion King&quot;, was hoping to work on &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; until Schumacher appointed him to work on &quot;Mulan&quot; instead. Acting as Head of Story, Sanders grew frustrated with the romantic comedy aspect of the story, and urged producer Pam Coats to be more faithful to the original legend by having Mulan leave home because of the love for her father. This convinced the filmmakers to decide to change Mulan&#x27;s character in order to make her more appealing and selfless.

Sequence Six—in which Mulan takes her father&#x27;s conscription order, cuts her long hair, and dons her father&#x27;s armor—served as a pivotal moment in the evolution of Mulan&#x27;s character. Director Barry Cook explained that the sequence initially started as a song storyboarded by Barry Johnson and redrawn by character designer Chen-Yi Chang. Following the story changes to have Mulan leave to save her father, the song was dropped. Storyboard artist and co-head of story Dean DeBlois was tasked to revise the sequence, and decided to board the sequence with &quot;minimal dialogue&quot;. Assisted with an existing musical selection from another film score courtesy of Sanders, the sequence reel was screened for Peter Schneider and Thomas Schumacher, both of whom were impressed. DeBlois stated, &quot;Sequence Six was the first sequence that got put into production, and it helped to establish our &#x27;silent&#x27; approach.&quot; Additionally, General Li was not originally going to be related to Shang at all, but by changing the story, the filmmakers were able to mirror the stories of both Shang&#x27;s and Mulan&#x27;s love for their fathers. As a Christian, Bancroft declined to explore Buddhism within the film.

Because there was no dragon in the original legend, Mulan did not have animal companions; it was Roy E. Disney who suggested the character of Mushu. Veteran story artist Joe Grant created the cricket character, Cri-Kee, though animator Barry Temple admitted &quot;the directors didn&#x27;t want him in the movie, the story department didn&#x27;t want him in the movie. The only people who truly wanted him in the movie were Michael Eisner and Joe Grant – and myself, because I was assigned the character. I would sit in meetings and they&#x27;d say, &#x27;Well, where&#x27;s the cricket during all this?&#x27; Somebody else would say, &#x27;Oh, to hell with the cricket.&#x27; They felt Cri-Kee was a character who wasn&#x27;t necessary to tell the story, which is true.&quot; Throughout development on the film, Grant would slip sketches of Cri-Kee under the directors&#x27; door.

===Casting===
Before production began, the production team sought out Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, or Korean vocal talents. Tia Carrere was an early candidate to voice the title character. However, Lea Salonga, who had been the singing voice of Princess Jasmine in &quot;Aladdin&quot;, was initially cast to provide both Mulan&#x27;s speaking and singing voices, but the directors did not find her attempt at a deeper speaking voice when Mulan impersonated Ping convincing, so Ming-Na Wen was brought in to speak the role. Salonga returned to provide the singing voice. Wen herself landed the role after the filmmakers listened to her narration at the beginning of &quot;The Joy Luck Club&quot;. Coats reflected on her decision, stating, &quot;When we heard Ming-Na doing that voice-over, we knew we had our Mulan. She has a very likable and lovely voice, and those are the qualities we were looking for.&quot;

For the role of Mushu, Disney was aiming for top Hollywood talent in the vein of Robin Williams&#x27; performance as the Genie in &quot;Aladdin&quot;. The filmmakers initially approached Joe Pesci and Richard Dreyfuss until Michael Eisner considered Eddie Murphy. After accepting the role, Murphy initially balked when he was asked to record at the Disney studios, but then asked to record the voice in his basement at his Bubble Hill mansion in Englewood, New Jersey.

For the speaking voice of Captain Li Shang, BD Wong was hired, although his singing voice, for the song &quot;I&#x27;ll Make a Man Out of You&quot;, was performed by Donny Osmond, who had previously auditioned to be the speaking voice of the title character in &quot;Hercules&quot;. Osmond&#x27;s casting originated from a suggestion from the casting director, and throughout recording, Osmond studied Wong&#x27;s dialogue tapes, and aimed to match his inflections and personality. Osmond commented that his sons decided that he had finally &quot;made it&quot; in show business when he was in a Disney film. Likewise for the role of Grandmother Fa, June Foray provided the speaking voice, and Marni Nixon supplied the singing voice.

Mimi Chan was chosen by Mark Henn as the model and martial arts video reference for Mulan. Character drawing sessions and live-action video reference shooting was done over the course of three years. Chan&#x27;s cousin, George Kee, was chosen to play the part of Captain Shang Li. Together, they choreographed fight sequences for the film&#x27;s song “I’ll Make a Man Out of You” and the film&#x27;s end finale.

===Animation and design===

To achieve a harmonious visual look, producer designer Hans Bacher and art director Ric Sluiter, along with Robert Walker and Head of Backgrounds Robert Stanton collaborated to establish a proper chronological location for the film in Chinese history. Since there was no general consensus on the time of Mulan&#x27;s existence, they based the visual design on the Ming and Qing dynasties. An important element of Bacher&#x27;s design was to turn the art style closer to Chinese painting, with watercolor and simpler design, as opposed to the details of &quot;The Lion King&quot; and &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot;. Bacher further studied more than thirty-five film directors ranging from the silent era German Expressionism, British and American epics of the 1950s and 60s, and the Spaghetti Westerns for inspiration for composition, lighting, and staging that would establish settings that enhanced the characters. Additional inspiration was found in the earlier Disney animated films such as &quot;Bambi&quot;, &quot;Pinocchio&quot; and &quot;Dumbo&quot; to establish a sense of staging.

In October 1997, the Walt Disney Company announced a major expansion of its Florida animation operations constructing a 200,000-square-foot, four-story animation building and the addition of 400 animators to the workforce.

To create 2,000 Hun soldiers during the Huns&#x27; attack sequence, the production team developed crowd simulation software called &quot;Attila&quot;. This software allows thousands of unique characters to move autonomously. A variant of the program called &quot;Dynasty&quot; was used in the final battle sequence to create a crowd of 3,000 in the Forbidden City. Pixar&#x27;s photorealistic open API RenderMan was used to render the crowd. Another software developed for this movie was &quot;Faux Plane&quot;, which was used to add depth to flat two-dimensional painting. Although developed late in production progress, &quot;Faux Plane&quot; was used in five shots, including the dramatic sequence which features the Great Wall of China, and the final battle sequence when Mulan runs to the Forbidden City. During the scene in which the citizens of China are bowing to Mulan, the crowd is a panoramic film of real people bowing. It was edited into the animated foreground of the scene.

==Music==
The songs featured in the film were written by composer Matthew Wilder and lyricist David Zippel. Stephen Schwartz was originally commissioned to write the songs for the film. Following the research trip to China in June 1994, Schwartz was contacted by former Disney studio chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg to compose songs for &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot;, which he agreed. Peter Schneider, then-president of Walt Disney Feature Animation, threatened to have Schwartz&#x27;s name removed from any publicity materials for &quot;Pocahontas&quot; and &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot;. Michael Eisner phoned Schwartz, and urged him to back out of his commitment to DreamWorks, but he refused and left the project. After Schwartz&#x27;s departure, his three songs, &quot;Written in Stone&quot;, &quot;Destiny&quot;, and &quot;China Doll&quot;, were dropped amid story and character changes by 1995. Shortly after, Disney music executive Chris Montan heard Matthew Wilder&#x27;s demo for a stage musical adaptation of Anne Rice&#x27;s &quot;Cry to Heaven&quot;, and selected Wilder to replace Schwartz. In July 1997, David Zippel joined to write the lyrics. The film featured five songs composed by Wilder and Zippel, with a sixth originally planned for Mushu, but dropped following Eddie Murphy&#x27;s involvement with the character.

Although Danny Elfman and Thomas Newman were considered to score the film, English composer Rachel Portman was selected as the film composer. However, Portman became pregnant during production, and decided to back out. Following Portman&#x27;s departure, Randy Edelman—whose &quot;Dragonheart&quot; theme was used in the trailer—and Kitarō were considered, until Jerry Goldsmith became available and signed on after dropping out of a project. The film&#x27;s soundtrack is credited for starting the career of pop singer Christina Aguilera, whose first song to be released in the U.S. was her rendition of &quot;Reflection&quot;, the first single from the &quot;Mulan&quot; soundtrack. The song, and Aguilera&#x27;s vocals, were so well received that it landed her a recording contract with RCA Records. In 1999, she would go on to release her self-titled debut album, on which &quot;Reflection&quot; was also included. The pop version of &quot;Reflection&quot; has a Polish version (&quot;Lustro&quot; performed by Edyta Górniak) and two Spanish versions, for Spain (performed by Malú) and Hispanic America (performed by Lucero). Other international versions include a Brazilian Portuguese version by Sandy &amp; Junior (&quot;Imagem&quot;), a Korean version performed by Lena Park, and a Mandarin version by Coco Lee.

The music featured during the haircut scene, titled &quot;Mulan&#x27;s Decision&quot;, is different in the soundtrack album. The soundtrack album uses an orchestrated score while the movie uses heavy synthesizer music. The synthesizer version is available on the limited edition CD. Salonga, who often sings movie music in her concerts, has done a Disney medley which climaxes with an expanded version of &quot;Reflection&quot; (not the same as those in Aguilera&#x27;s version). Salonga also provided the singing voice for Mulan in the film&#x27;s sequel, &quot;Mulan II&quot;.

==Release==
===Marketing===
The film&#x27;s teaser trailer was released in June 1997, attached to the theatrical releases of &quot;Hercules,&quot; &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; and &quot;Flubber&quot;. Teaser spots were shown during CBS&#x27;s coverage of the 1998 Winter Olympics.

Because of the disappointing box office performances of &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; and &quot;Hercules&quot;, Disney restricted its marketing campaign for &quot;Mulan&quot;, spending $30 million on promotional advertisements compared to more than $60 million for &quot;Hercules&quot; the year before. Rather than holding a lavish media event premiere like those of the past few years, such as premiering &quot;Pocahontas&quot; in Central Park and bringing the Main Street Electrical Parade to Fifth Avenue for &quot;Hercules&quot;, Disney opted to premiere the film on June 5, 1998, at the Hollywood Bowl, complete with Chinese lanterns and fortune cookies. Two days before the general release, McDonald&#x27;s launched its promotional campaign by including one of eight toys free with the purchase of a Happy Meal. The promotion also included Szechuan sauce for its Chicken McNuggets, which would be referenced in a 2017 episode of the Adult Swim series &quot;Rick and Morty&quot; and subsequently brought back by McDonald&#x27;s as a promotional item related to that show.

In collaboration with Disney, Hyperion Books published &quot;The Art of Mulan&quot; authored by Jeff Kurtti, which chronicled the production of the film. In addition with its publication, Hyperion Books also issued a collector&#x27;s &quot;folding, accordion book&quot; of the ancient poem that inspired the film. On August 18, 1998, around 3,700 backpacks and 1,800 pieces of luggage were recalled back to their manufacturer, Pyramid Accessories Inc., when it was discovered they contained lead-based paint.

===Home media===
The film was first released on VHS on February 2, 1999, as part of the Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection lineup. &quot;Mulan&quot; was released on DVD on November 9, 1999, as a Walt Disney Limited Issue for a limited sixty-day time period before going into moratorium. On February 1, 2000, it was re-released on VHS and DVD as part of the Walt Disney Gold Classic Collection lineup. The VHS and DVD were accompanied by two music videos of &quot;Reflection&quot; and &quot;True to Your Heart&quot; while the DVD additionally contained the theatrical trailer and character artwork. The Gold Collection release was returned into the Disney Vault on January 31, 2002. On October 26, 2004, Walt Disney Home Entertainment re-released a restored print of &quot;Mulan&quot; on VHS and as a 2-disc Special Edition DVD.

In March 2013, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released &quot;Mulan&quot; and &quot;Mulan II&quot; on Blu-ray and DVD to coincide with the film&#x27;s 15th anniversary.

In September 2017, &quot;Mulan&quot; became available to Netflix users through their streaming service. In November 2019, &quot;Mulan&quot; became available for streaming on Disney+. A year later, &quot;Mulan&quot; was released on 4K Blu-ray.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Mulan&quot; grossed $22.8 million in its opening weekend, ranking second behind &quot;The X-Files&quot;. It went on to gross $120 million in the United States and Canada combined, and $304 million worldwide, making it the second-highest grossing family film of the year, behind &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot;, and the seventh-highest-grossing film of the year overall. While &quot;Mulan&quot; domestically out-grossed the previous two Disney animated films which had preceded it, &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; and &quot;Hercules&quot;, its box office returns failed to match those of the Disney films from the first half of the Renaissance such as &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, &quot;Aladdin&quot;, and &quot;The Lion King&quot;. Internationally, its highest grossing releases included those in the United Kingdom ($14.6 million) and France ($10.2 million).

===Critical reception===
Upon release, &quot;Mulan&quot; received mostly positive reviews from film critics, who praised it for exploring themes such as strength, feminism, and gender roles. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gave the film an approval rating of , based on reviews, with an average rating of . The site&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;Exploring themes of family duty and honor, &quot;Mulan&quot; breaks new ground as a Disney film, while still bringing vibrant animation and sprightly characters to the screen.&quot; In a 2009 countdown, Rotten Tomatoes ranked it seventeenth out of the fifty canonical animated Disney features. On Metacritic, the film has a score of 72 out of 100, based on 24 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare &quot;A+&quot; grade.

Roger Ebert, reviewing for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, gave &quot;Mulan&quot; three-and-a-half stars out of four in his written review. He said that &quot;&quot;Mulan&quot; is an impressive achievement, with a story and treatment ranking with &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; and &quot;The Lion King&quot;&quot;. Likewise, James Berardinelli of &quot;ReelViews&quot; awarded the film three-and-a-half stars out of four praising the lead character, its theme of war, and the animation. He concluded that &quot;Adults will appreciate the depth of characterization while kids will love Mulan&#x27;s sidekick, a colorful dragon named Mushu. Everyone will be entertained [by] the fast-moving plot and rich animation.&quot; Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; called the film &quot;a female empowerment story par excellence, as well as a G-rated picture that may have strong appeal for many adults.&quot; McCarthy further praised the voice cast and background design, but overall felt the film &quot;goes about halfway toward setting new boundaries for Disney’s, and the industry&#x27;s, animated features, but doesn&#x27;t go far enough.&quot; Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; graded the film a B+ writing, &quot;Vividly animated, with a bursting palette that evokes both the wintry grandeur and decorative splendor of ancient China, &quot;Mulan&quot; is artful and satisfying in a slightly remote way.&quot;

Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; described the film as &quot;a big disappointment when compared with the studio&#x27;s other recent films about a female hero searching for independence.&quot; He was further critical of Mulan&#x27;s characterization in comparison to Ariel and Belle, and claimed the &quot;design of the film does not take advantage of the inspiration provided by classic Chinese artists, and the songs are not memorable.&quot; Similarly, Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; criticized the lack of detail in the background art and described it as &quot;the most inert and formulaic of recent Disney animated films.&quot; Reviewing the film for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Kenneth Turan wrote &quot;&quot;Mulan&quot; has its accomplishments, but unlike the best of Disney&#x27;s output, it comes off as more manufactured than magical.&quot; While he praised the title character, he highlighted that the &quot;by-now-standard hip patter (prepare for jokes about cross-dressing) is so tepid that not even five credited writers can revive it, and the songs by Matthew Wilder and David Zippel (with Lea Salonga and Donny Osmond singing for the leads) lack the spark that Zippel&#x27;s lyrics brought to the underappreciated &quot;Hercules&quot;.&quot; Ed Gonzalez of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; criticized the film as &quot;soulless&quot; in its portrayal of East Asian society.

This movie was also the subject of comment from feminist critics. Mimi Nguyen says the film &quot;pokes fun at the ultimately repressive gender roles that seek to make Mulan a domesticated creature&quot;. Pam Coats, the producer of &quot;Mulan&quot;, said that the film aims to present a character who exhibits both masculine and feminine influences, being both physically and mentally strong.

===Accolades===
* In 2008, the film was one of 50 nominees listed on the ballot for the American Film Institute&#x27;s top 10 greatest American animated movies.

===Reception in China===
Disney was keen to promote &quot;Mulan&quot; to the Chinese, hoping to replicate their success with the 1994 film &quot;The Lion King&quot;, which was one of the country&#x27;s highest-grossing Western films at that time. Disney also hoped it might smooth over relations with the Chinese government which had soured after the release of &quot;Kundun&quot;, a Disney-funded biography of the Dalai Lama that the Chinese government considered politically provocative. China had threatened to curtail business negotiations with Disney over that film and, as the government only accepted ten foreign films to be shown in China each year, &quot;Mulan&quot;″s chances of being accepted were low. Finally, after a year&#x27;s delay, the Chinese government did allow the film a limited Chinese release, but only after the Chinese New Year, so as to ensure that local films dominated the more lucrative holiday market. Publications have reported that critical and audience reception in China was negative overall, who accused Disney of westernizing the tale. Box office income was low, due to both the unfavorable release date and rampant piracy. Chinese people also complained about Mulan&#x27;s depiction as too foreign-looking and the story as too different from the myths.

==Legacy==
The World History Encyclopedia has credited the film with introducing the Mulan legend to a wider audience, in turn inspiring greater interest in Chinese history and literature.

===Video game===
A Windows, Macintosh, and PlayStation point-and-click adventure interactive storybook based on the film, &quot;Disney&#x27;s Animated Storybook: Mulan&quot; (titled &quot;Disney&#x27;s Story Studio: Mulan&quot; on PlayStation), was released on December 15, 1999. The game was developed by Media Station for computers and Revolution Software (under the name &quot;Kids Revolution&quot;) for PlayStation. The game was met with generally positive reception and holds a 70.67% average rating at the review aggregator website GameRankings.

===Live-action adaptation===

Walt Disney Pictures first expressed interest in a live-action adaptation of &quot;Mulan&quot; in the 2000s. Zhang Ziyi was to star in it and Chuck Russell was chosen as the director. The film was originally planned to start filming in October 2010, but was eventually canceled.

In 2015, Disney again began developing a live-action remake. Elizabeth Martin and Lauren Hynek&#x27;s script treatment reportedly featured a white merchant who falls in love with Mulan, and is drawn into a central role in the country&#x27;s conflict with the Huns. According to a &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; source, the spec script was only a &quot;jumping-off point&quot; and all main characters will in fact be Chinese. &quot;Dawn of the Planet of the Apes&quot; and &quot;Jurassic World&quot; screenwriters Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver are to rewrite Hynek and Martin&#x27;s screenplay with Chris Bender, J. C. Spink and Jason Reed producing. In February 2017, it was announced that Niki Caro will direct the live-action adaptation of the 1998 animated film.

The casting process of a Chinese actress to portray the heroine began in October 2016. The film was originally scheduled to be released on November 2, 2018, but it was later taken off the release schedule with &quot;The Nutcracker and the Four Realms&quot; taking its old slot. On November 29, 2017, Liu Yifei was cast as the titular character. The film had its Hollywood premiere on March 9, 2020. Disney originally scheduled the film to be released in theaters on March 27, 2020; however, this was pushed back to July 24, and then August 21. The film&#x27;s theatrical release was canceled in the United States and would instead have its premiere for a premium fee on Disney+ on September 4, 2020. It will still be released theatrically in countries where theaters have re-opened, such as China, as well as in other countries that do not have Disney+.

Donnie Yen was cast as Commander Tung, a mentor and teacher to Mulan. Following him, Jet Li joined the film as the emperor of China, Gong Li was cast as the villain, a witch, and Xana Tang was announced to play Mulan&#x27;s sister. The next month, Utkarsh Ambudkar was cast as Skatch, a con artist, and Ron Yuan was cast as Sergeant Qiang, the second in command of the Imperial Regiment. In June, Yoson An was cast as Chen Honghui, &quot;a confident and ambitious recruit&quot; who becomes Mulan&#x27;s love interest. In July, Jason Scott Lee joined the cast as Bori Khan, a secondary villain and warrior seeking revenge. In August 2018, Tzi Ma, Rosalind Chao, Cheng Pei-Pei, Nelson Lee, Jimmy Wong and Doua Moua were added to the cast.

===References in Disney media===
Although Mulan isn&#x27;t royalty by either birth or marriage (her husband is merely a high-ranking military officer), she is part of the Disney Princess media franchise. Mulan was the last addition to the lineup until Princess Tiana from &quot;The Princess and the Frog&quot; was added in 2009, 11 years later. In the film &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot;, Nani has a poster of Mulan in her room. &quot;Mulan&quot; is also present in the Disney and Square Enix video game series &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;. In the first &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; and in &quot;Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories&quot;, Mushu is a summonable character, and in &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;, the movie is featured as a playable world named &quot;The Land of Dragons&quot;, with the cast of the film reprising their roles (excluding Shan-Yu, now voiced by Corey Burton); in the first chapter, the film&#x27;s plot is changed to accommodate the game&#x27;s characters (Sora, Donald and Goofy) and Mulan (both as herself and as &quot;Ping&quot;) able to join the player&#x27;s party as a skilled sword fighter, while the second chapter covers Organization XIII member Xigbar as a spy in black and Mulan&#x27;s determination to stop him with Sora&#x27;s help. Actress Jamie Chung plays a live-action version of Mulan in the second, third, and fifth seasons of the ABC television series &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot;. The video game &quot;Disney Magic Kingdoms&quot; includes some characters of the film and some attractions based on locations of the film as content to unlock for a limited time.

<doc id="55721" wikidata="Q181598" url="?curid=55721" title="King Lear">
<text>The Tragedy of King Lear, often shortened to King Lear, is a tragedy written by William Shakespeare. It is loosely based on the mythological Leir of Britain. King Lear, in preparation for his old age, divides his power and land between his daughters Goneril and Regan, who pay homage to gain favour, feigning love. The King&#x27;s third daughter, Cordelia, is offered a third of his kingdom also, but refuses to be insincere in her praise and affection. She instead offers the respect of a daughter and is disowned by Lear who seeks flattery. Regan and Goneril subsequently break promises to host Lear and his entourage, so he opts to become homeless and destitute, and goes insane. The French King married to Cordelia then invades Britain to restore order and Lear&#x27;s rule. In a subplot, Edmund, the illegitimate son of the Earl of Gloucester, betrays his brother and father. Tragically, Lear, Cordelia and several other main characters die.

The plot and subplot overlap and intertwine with political power plays, personal ambition, and assumed supernatural interventions and pagan beliefs. The first known performance of any version of Shakespeare&#x27;s play was on Saint Stephen&#x27;s Day in 1606. Modern editors derive their texts from three extant publications: the 1608 quarto (Q1), the 1619 quarto (Q2, unofficial and based on Q1), and the 1623 First Folio. The quarto versions differ significantly from the folio version.

The play was often revised after the English Restoration for audiences who disliked its dark and depressing tone, but since the 19th century Shakespeare&#x27;s original play has been regarded as one of his supreme achievements. Both the title role and the supporting roles have been coveted by accomplished actors, and the play has been widely adapted. In his &quot;A Defence of Poetry&quot; (1821), Percy Bysshe Shelley called &quot;King Lear&quot; &quot;the most perfect specimen of the dramatic art existing in the world&quot;, and the play is regularly cited as one of the greatest works of literature ever written.

==Plot==

===Act I===

King Lear of Britain, elderly and wanting to retire from the duties of the monarchy, decides to divide his realm among his three daughters, and declares he will offer the largest share to the one who loves him most. The eldest, Goneril, speaks first, declaring her love for her father in fulsome terms. Moved by her flattery, Lear proceeds to grant to Goneril her share as soon as she has finished her declaration, before Regan and Cordelia have a chance to speak. He then awards to Regan her share as soon as she has spoken. When it is finally the turn of his youngest and favourite daughter, Cordelia, at first she refuses to say anything (&quot;Nothing, my Lord&quot;) and then declares there is nothing to compare her love to, no words to express it properly; she says honestly but bluntly that she loves him according to her bond, no more and no less, and will reserve half of her love for her future husband. Infuriated, Lear disinherits Cordelia and divides her share between her elder sisters.

The Earl of Gloucester and the Earl of Kent observe that, by dividing his realm between Goneril and Regan, Lear has awarded his realm in equal shares to the peerages of the Duke of Albany (Goneril&#x27;s husband) and the Duke of Cornwall (Regan&#x27;s husband). Kent objects to Lear&#x27;s unfair treatment of Cordelia. Enraged by Kent&#x27;s protests, Lear banishes him from the country. Lear then summons the Duke of Burgundy and the King of France, who have both proposed marriage to Cordelia. Learning that Cordelia has been disinherited, the Duke of Burgundy withdraws his suit, but the King of France is impressed by her honesty and marries her nonetheless. The King of France is shocked by Lear&#x27;s decision because up until this time Lear has only praised and favoured Cordelia (&quot;... she whom even but now was your best object, / The argument of your praise, balm of your age, ...&quot;). Meanwhile, Gloucester has introduced his illegitimate son Edmund to Kent.
Lear announces he will live alternately with Goneril and Regan, and their husbands. He reserves to himself a retinue of 100 knights, to be supported by his daughters. After Cordelia bids farewell to them and leaves with the King of France, Goneril and Regan speak privately, revealing that their declarations of love were false and that they view Lear as a foolish old man.

Gloucester&#x27;s son Edmund resents his illegitimate status and plots to dispose of his legitimate older half-brother, Edgar. He tricks his father with a forged letter, making him think that Edgar plans to usurp the estate. The Earl of Kent returns from exile in disguise (calling himself Caius), and Lear hires him as a servant. At Albany and Goneril&#x27;s house, Lear and Kent quarrel with Oswald, Goneril&#x27;s steward. Lear discovers that now that Goneril has power, she no longer respects him. She orders him to reduce the number of his disorderly retinue. Enraged, Lear departs for Regan&#x27;s home. The Fool reproaches Lear with his foolishness in giving everything to Regan and Goneril and predicts that Regan will treat him no better.

===Act II===
Edmund learns from Curan, a courtier, that there is likely to be war between Albany and Cornwall and that Regan and Cornwall are to arrive at Gloucester&#x27;s house that evening. Taking advantage of the arrival of the duke and Regan, Edmund fakes an attack by Edgar, and Gloucester is completely taken in. He disinherits Edgar and proclaims him an outlaw.

Bearing Lear&#x27;s message to Regan, Kent meets Oswald again at Gloucester&#x27;s home, quarrels with him again and is put in the stocks by Regan and her husband Cornwall. When Lear arrives, he objects to the mistreatment of his messenger, but Regan is as dismissive of her father as Goneril was. Lear is enraged but impotent. Goneril arrives and supports Regan&#x27;s argument against him. Lear yields completely to his rage. He rushes out into a storm to rant against his ungrateful daughters, accompanied by the mocking Fool.

===Act III===

Kent later follows to protect Lear. Gloucester protests against Lear&#x27;s mistreatment. With Lear&#x27;s retinue of a hundred knights dissolved, the only companions he has left are his Fool and Kent. Wandering on the heath after the storm, Edgar, in the guise of a madman named Tom o&#x27; Bedlam, meets Lear. Edgar babbles madly while Lear denounces his daughters. Kent leads them all to shelter.

Kent tells a gentleman that a French army has landed in Britain, aiming to reinstate Lear to the throne. He then sends the gentleman to give Cordelia a message while he looks for King Lear on the heath. Meanwhile, Edmund learns that Gloucester is aware of France&#x27;s impending invasion and betrays his father to Cornwall, Regan, and Goneril. Once Edmund leaves with Goneril to warn Albany about the invasion, Gloucester is arrested, and Regan and Cornwall gouge out Gloucester&#x27;s eyes. As they do this, a servant is overcome with horror and comes to Gloucester&#x27;s defence, mortally wounding Cornwall. Regan kills the servant and tells Gloucester that Edmund betrayed him. Then, as she did to her father in Act II, she sends Gloucester out to wander the heath.

===Act IV===
Edgar, in his madman&#x27;s disguise, meets his blinded father on the heath. Gloucester, sightless and failing to recognise Edgar&#x27;s voice, begs him to lead him to a cliff at Dover so that he may jump to his death. Goneril discovers that she finds Edmund more attractive than her honest husband Albany, whom she regards as cowardly. Albany has developed a conscience—he is disgusted by the sisters&#x27; treatment of Lear and Gloucester—and denounces his wife. Goneril sends Edmund back to Regan. After receiving news of Cornwall&#x27;s death, she fears her newly widowed sister may steal Edmund and sends him a letter through Oswald. Now alone with Lear, Kent leads him to the French army, which is commanded by Cordelia. But Lear is half-mad and terribly embarrassed by his earlier follies. At Regan&#x27;s instigation, Albany joins his forces with hers against the French. Goneril&#x27;s suspicions about Regan&#x27;s motives are confirmed and returned, as Regan rightly guesses the meaning of her letter and declares to Oswald that she is a more appropriate match for Edmund. Edgar pretends to lead Gloucester to a cliff, then changes his voice and tells Gloucester he has miraculously survived a great fall. Lear appears, by now, completely mad. He rants that the whole world is corrupt and runs off.

Oswald appears, still looking for Edmund. On Regan&#x27;s orders, he tries to kill Gloucester but is killed by Edgar. In Oswald&#x27;s pocket, Edgar finds Goneril&#x27;s letter, in which she encourages Edmund to kill her husband and take her as his wife. Kent and Cordelia take charge of Lear, whose madness quickly passes. 

===Act V===
Regan, Goneril, Albany, and Edmund meet with their forces. Albany insists that they fight the French invaders but not harm Lear or Cordelia. The two sisters lust for Edmund, who has made promises to both. He considers the dilemma and plots the deaths of Albany, Lear, and Cordelia. Edgar gives Goneril&#x27;s letter to Albany. The armies meet in battle, the Britons defeat the French, and Lear and Cordelia are captured. Edmund sends Lear and Cordelia off with secret joint orders from him (representing Regan and her forces) and Goneril (representing the forces of her estranged husband, Albany) for the execution of Cordelia.

The victorious British leaders meet, and the recently widowed Regan now declares she will marry Edmund. But Albany exposes the intrigues of Edmund and Goneril and proclaims Edmund a traitor. Regan falls ill, having been poisoned by Goneril, and is escorted offstage, where she dies. Edmund defies Albany, who calls for a trial by combat. Edgar appears masked and in armour and challenges Edmund to a duel. No one knows who he is. Edgar wounds Edmund fatally, though Edmund does not die immediately. Albany confronts Goneril with the letter which was intended to be his death warrant; she flees in shame and rage. Edgar reveals himself and reports that Gloucester died offstage from the shock and joy of learning that Edgar is alive, after Edgar revealed himself to his father.

Offstage, Goneril, her plans thwarted, commits suicide. The dying Edmund decides, though he admits it is against his own character, to try to save Lear and Cordelia, but his confession comes too late. Soon after, Albany sends men to countermand Edmund&#x27;s orders. Lear enters bearing Cordelia&#x27;s corpse in his arms, having survived by killing the executioner. Kent appears and Lear now recognises him. Albany urges Lear to resume his throne, but as with Gloucester, the trials Lear has been through have finally overwhelmed him, and he dies. Albany then asks Kent and Edgar to take charge of the throne. Kent declines, explaining that his master is calling him on a journey and he must follow.

==Sources==

Shakespeare&#x27;s play is based on various accounts of the semi-legendary Brythonic figure Leir of Britain, whose name has been linked by some scholars to the Brythonic god Lir/Llŷr, though in actuality the names are not etymologically related. Shakespeare&#x27;s most important source is probably the second edition of &quot;The Chronicles of England, Scotlande, and Irelande&quot; by Raphael Holinshed, published in 1587. Holinshed himself found the story in the earlier by Geoffrey of Monmouth, which was written in the 12th century. Edmund Spenser&#x27;s &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;, published 1590, also contains a character named Cordelia, who also dies from hanging, as in &quot;King Lear&quot;.

Other possible sources are the anonymous play &quot;King Leir&quot; (published in 1605); &quot;The Mirror for Magistrates&quot; (1574), by John Higgins; &quot;The Malcontent&quot; (1604), by John Marston; &quot;The London Prodigal&quot; (1605); Montaigne&#x27;s &quot;Essays&quot;, which were translated into English by John Florio in 1603; &quot;A Description of Elizabethan England&quot; (1577), by William Harrison; &quot;Remains Concerning Britain&quot; (1606), by William Camden; &quot;Albion&#x27;s England&quot; (1589), by William Warner; and &quot;A Declaration of egregious Popish Impostures&quot; (1603), by Samuel Harsnett, which provided some of the language used by Edgar while he feigns madness. &quot;King Lear&quot; is also a literary variant of a common folk tale, &quot;Love Like Salt&quot;, Aarne–Thompson type 923, in which a father rejects his youngest daughter for a statement of her love that does not please him.

The source of the subplot involving Gloucester, Edgar, and Edmund is a tale in Philip Sidney&#x27;s &quot;Countess of Pembroke&#x27;s Arcadia&quot; (1580–90), with a blind Paphlagonian king and his two sons, Leonatus and Plexitrus.

===Changes from source material===

Besides the subplot involving the Earl of Gloucester and his sons, the principal innovation Shakespeare made to this story was the death of Cordelia and Lear at the end; in the account by Geoffrey of Monmouth, Cordelia restores Lear to the throne, and succeeds him as ruler after his death. During the 17th century, Shakespeare&#x27;s tragic ending was much criticised and alternative versions were written by Nahum Tate, in which the leading characters survived and Edgar and Cordelia were married (despite the fact that Cordelia was previously betrothed to the King of France). As Harold Bloom states: &quot;Tate&#x27;s version held the stage for almost 150 years, until Edmund Kean reinstated the play&#x27;s tragic ending in 1823.&quot;

Holinshed states that the story is set when Joash was King of Judah (), while Shakespeare avoids dating the setting, only suggesting that it is sometime in the pre-Christian era (with numerous anachronisms, such as Anglo-Saxon names and titles like Duke and Earl).

The characters of Earl &quot;Caius&quot; of Kent and The Fool were created wholly by Shakespeare in order to engage in character-driven conversations with Lear. Oswald the steward, the confidant of Goneril, was created as a similar expository device.

Shakespeare&#x27;s Lear and other characters make oaths to Jupiter, Juno, and Apollo. While the presence of Roman religion in Britain is technically an anachronism, nothing was known about any religion that existed in Britain at the time of Lear&#x27;s alleged life.

Holinshed identifies the personal names of the Duke of Albany (Maglanus), the Duke of Cornwall (Henninus), and the Gallic/French leader (Aganippus). Shakespeare refers to these characters by their titles only, and also changes the nature of Albany from a villain to a hero, by reassigning Albany&#x27;s wicked deeds to Cornwall. Maglanus and Henninus are killed in the final battle, but are survived by their sons Margan and Cunedag. In Shakespeare&#x27;s version, Cornwall is killed by a servant who objects to the torture of the Earl of Gloucester, while Albany is one of the few surviving main characters. Isaac Asimov surmised that this alteration was due to the title Duke of Albany being held in 1606 by Prince Charles, the younger son of Shakespeare&#x27;s benefactor King James. However, this explanation is faulty, because James&#x27; older son, Prince Henry, held the title Duke of Cornwall at the same time.

==Date and text==

There is no direct evidence to indicate when &quot;King Lear&quot; was written or first performed. It is thought to have been composed sometime between 1603 and 1606. A Stationers&#x27; Register entry notes a performance before James I on 26 December 1606. The 1603 date originates from words in Edgar&#x27;s speeches which may derive from Samuel Harsnett&#x27;s &quot;Declaration of Egregious Popish Impostures&quot; (1603). A significant issue in the dating of the play is the relationship of &quot;King Lear&quot; to the play titled &quot;The True Chronicle History of the Life and Death of King Leir and his Three Daughters&quot;, which was published for the first time after its entry in the Stationers&#x27; Register of 8 May 1605. This play had a significant effect on Shakespeare, and his close study of it suggests that he was using a printed copy, which suggests a composition date of 1605–06. Conversely, Frank Kermode, in the &quot;Riverside Shakespeare&quot;, considers the publication of &quot;Leir&quot; to have been a response to performances of Shakespeare&#x27;s already-written play; noting a sonnet by William Strachey that may have verbal resemblances with &quot;Lear&quot;, Kermode concludes that &quot;1604–05 seems the best compromise&quot;.

A line in the play that regards &quot;These late eclipses in the sun and moon&quot; appears to refer to a phenomenon of two eclipses that occurred over London within a few days of each other—the lunar eclipse of 27 September 1605 and the solar eclipse of 12 October 1605. This remarkable pair of events stirred up much discussion among astrologers. Edmund&#x27;s line &quot;A prediction I read this other day...&quot; apparently refers to the published prognostications of the astrologers, which followed after the eclipses. This suggests that those lines in Act I were written sometime after both the eclipses and the published comments.

The modern text of &quot;King Lear&quot; derives from three sources: two quartos, one published in 1608 (Q1) and the other in 1619 (Q2), and the version in the First Folio of 1623 (F1). Q1 has &quot;many errors and muddles&quot;. Q2 was based on Q1. It introduced corrections and new errors. Q2 also informed the Folio text. Quarto and Folio texts differ significantly. Q1 contains 285 lines not in F1; F1 contains around 100 lines not in Q1. Also, at least a thousand individual words are changed between the two texts, each text has different styles of punctuation, and about half the verse lines in the F1 are either printed as prose or differently divided in the Q1. Early editors, beginning with Alexander Pope, conflated the two texts, creating the modern version that has been commonly used since. The conflated version originated with the assumptions that the differences in the versions do not indicate any re-writing by the author; that Shakespeare wrote only one original manuscript, which is now lost; and that the Quarto and Folio versions contain various distortions of that lost original. In 2021, Duncan Salkeld endorsed this view, suggesting that Q1 was typeset by a reader dictating to the compositor, leading to many slips caused by mishearing. Other editors, such as Nuttall and Bloom, have suggested Shakespeare himself may have been involved in reworking passages in the play to accommodate performances and other textual requirements of the play.

As early as 1931, Madeleine Doran suggested that the two texts had independent histories, and that these differences between them were critically interesting. This argument, however, was not widely discussed until the late 1970s, when it was revived, principally by Michael Warren and Gary Taylor, who discuss a variety of theories including Doran&#x27;s idea that the Quarto may have been printed from Shakespeare&#x27;s foul papers, and that the Folio may have been printed from a promptbook prepared for a production.

The New Cambridge Shakespeare has published separate editions of Q and F; the most recent Pelican Shakespeare edition contains both the 1608 Quarto and the 1623 Folio text as well as a conflated version; the New Arden edition edited by R. A. Foakes offers a conflated text that indicates those passages that are found only in Q or F. Both Anthony Nuttall of Oxford University and Harold Bloom of Yale University have endorsed the view of Shakespeare having revised the tragedy at least once during his lifetime. As Bloom indicates: &quot;At the close of Shakespeare&#x27;s revised &quot;King Lear&quot;, a reluctant Edgar becomes King of Britain, accepting his destiny but in the accents of despair. Nuttall speculates that Edgar, like Shakespeare himself, usurps the power of manipulating the audience by deceiving poor Gloucester.&quot;

==Interpretations and analysis==

===Historicist interpretations===
John F. Danby, in his &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Doctrine of Nature – A Study of King Lear&quot; (1949), argues that &quot;Lear&quot; dramatizes, among other things, the current meanings of &quot;Nature&quot;. The words &quot;nature&quot;, &quot;natural&quot;, and &quot;unnatural&quot; occur over forty times in the play, reflecting a debate in Shakespeare&#x27;s time about what nature really was like; this debate pervades the play and finds symbolic expression in Lear&#x27;s changing attitude to Thunder. There are two strongly contrasting views of human nature in the play: that of the Lear party (Lear, Gloucester, Albany, Kent), exemplifying the philosophy of Bacon and Hooker, and that of the Edmund party (Edmund, Cornwall, Goneril, Regan), akin to the views later formulated by Hobbes, though the latter had not yet begun his philosophy career when &quot;Lear&quot; was first performed. Along with the two views of Nature, the play contains two views of Reason, brought out in Gloucester and Edmund&#x27;s speeches on astrology (1.2). The rationality of the Edmund party is one with which a modern audience more readily identifies. But the Edmund party carries bold rationalism to such extremes that it becomes madness: a madness-in-reason, the ironic counterpart of Lear&#x27;s &quot;reason in madness&quot; (IV.6.190) and the Fool&#x27;s wisdom-in-folly. This betrayal of reason lies behind the play&#x27;s later emphasis on &quot;feeling&quot;.

The two Natures and the two Reasons imply two societies. Edmund is the New Man, a member of an age of competition, suspicion, glory, in contrast with the older society which has come down from the Middle Ages, with its belief in co-operation, reasonable decency, and respect for the whole as greater than the part. &quot;King Lear&quot; is thus an allegory. The older society, that of the medieval vision, with its doting king, falls into error, and is threatened by the new Machiavellianism; it is regenerated and saved by a vision of a new order, embodied in the king&#x27;s rejected daughter. Cordelia, in the allegorical scheme, is threefold: a person; an ethical principle (love); and a community. Nevertheless, Shakespeare&#x27;s understanding of the New Man is so extensive as to amount almost to sympathy. Edmund is the last great expression in Shakespeare of that side of Renaissance individualism—the energy, the emancipation, the courage—which has made a positive contribution to the heritage of the West. &quot;He embodies something vital which a final synthesis must reaffirm. But he makes an absolute claim which Shakespeare will not support. It is right for man to feel, as Edmund does, that society exists for man, not man for society. It is not right to assert the kind of man Edmund would erect to this supremacy.&quot;

The play offers an alternative to the feudal-Machiavellian polarity, an alternative foreshadowed in France&#x27;s speech (I.1.245–256), in Lear and Gloucester&#x27;s prayers (III.4. 28–36; IV.1.61–66), and in the figure of Cordelia. Until the decent society is achieved, we are meant to take as role-model (though qualified by Shakespearean ironies) Edgar, &quot;the machiavel of goodness&quot;, endurance, courage and &quot;ripeness&quot;.

The play also contains references to disputes between King James I and Parliament. In the 1604 elections to the House of Commons, Sir John Fortescue, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, was defeated by a member of the Buckinghamshire gentry, Sir Francis Goodwin. Displeased with the result, James declared the result of the Buckinghhamshire election invalid, and swore in Fortescue as the MP for Buckinghamshire while the House of Commons insisted on swearing in Goodwin, leading to a clash between King and Parliament over who had the right to decide who sat in the House of Commons. The MP Thomas Wentworth, the son of another MP Peter Wentworth—often imprisoned under Elizabeth for raising the question of the succession in the Commons—was most forceful in protesting James&#x27;s attempts to reduce the powers of the House of Commons, saying the King could not just declare the results of an election invalid if he disliked who had won the seat as he was insisting that he could. The character of Kent resembles Peter Wentworth in the way which is tactless and blunt in advising Lear, but his point is valid that Lear should be more careful with his friends and advisers.

Just as the House of Commons had argued to James that their loyalty was to the constitution of England, not to the King personally, Kent insists his loyalty is institutional, not personal, as he is loyal to the realm of which the king is head, not to Lear himself, and he tells Lear to behave better for the good of the realm. By contrast, Lear makes an argument similar to James that as king, he holds absolute power and could disregard the views of his subjects if they displease him whenever he liked. In the play, the characters like the Fool, Kent and Cordelia, whose loyalties are institutional, seeing their first loyalty to the realm, are portrayed more favorably than those like Regan and Goneril, who insist they are only loyal to the king, seeing their loyalties as personal. Likewise, James was notorious for his riotous, debauched lifestyle and his preference for sycophantic courtiers who were forever singing his praises out of the hope for advancement, aspects of his court that closely resemble the court of King Lear, who starts out in the play with a riotous, debauched court of sycophantic courtiers. Kent criticises Oswald as a man unworthy of office who has only been promoted because of his sycophancy, telling Lear that he should be loyal to those who are willing to tell him the truth, a statement that many in England wished that James would heed.

Furthermore, James VI of Scotland inherited the throne of England upon the death of Elizabeth I in 1603, thereby uniting the kingdoms of the island of Britain into one, and a major issue of his reign was the attempt to forge a common British identity. James had given his sons Henry and Charles the titles of Duke of Cornwall and Duke of Albany, the same titles borne by the men married to Regan and Goneril. The play begins with Lear ruling all of Britain and ends with him destroying his realm; the critic Andrew Hadfield argued that the division of Britain by Lear was an inversion of the unification of Britain by James, who believed his policies would result in a well governed and prosperous unified realm being passed on to his heir. Hadfield argued that the play was meant as a warning to James as in the play a monarch loses everything by giving in to his sycophantic courtiers who only seek to use him while neglecting those who truly loved him. Hadfield also argued that the world of Lear&#x27;s court is &quot;childish&quot; with Lear presenting himself as the father of the nation and requiring all of his subjects, not just his children, to address him in paternal terms, which infantises most of the people around him, which pointedly references James&#x27;s statement in his 1598 book &quot;The Trew Law of Free Monarchies&quot; that the king is the &quot;father of the nation&quot;, for whom all of his subjects are his children.

===Psychoanalytic and psychosocial interpretations===
&quot;King Lear&quot; provides a basis for &quot;the primary enactment of psychic breakdown in English literary history&quot;. The play begins with Lear&#x27;s &quot;near-fairytale narcissism&quot;.

Given the absence of legitimate mothers in &quot;King Lear&quot;, Coppélia Kahn provides a psychoanalytic interpretation of the &quot;maternal subtext&quot; found in the play. According to Kahn, Lear&#x27;s old age forces him to regress into an infantile disposition, and he now seeks a love that is traditionally satisfied by a mothering woman, but in the absence of a real mother, his daughters become the mother figures. Lear&#x27;s contest of love between Goneril, Regan, and Cordelia serves as the binding agreement; his daughters will get their inheritance provided that they care for him, especially Cordelia, on whose &quot;kind nursery&quot; he will greatly depend.

Cordelia&#x27;s refusal to dedicate herself to him and love him as more than a father has been interpreted by some as a resistance to incest, but Kahn also inserts the image of a rejecting mother. The situation is now a reversal of parent-child roles, in which Lear&#x27;s madness is a childlike rage due to his deprivation of filial/maternal care. Even when Lear and Cordelia are captured together, his madness persists as Lear envisions a nursery in prison, where Cordelia&#x27;s sole existence is for him. It is only with Cordelia&#x27;s death that his fantasy of a daughter-mother ultimately diminishes, as &quot;King Lear&quot; concludes with only male characters living.
Sigmund Freud asserted that Cordelia symbolises Death. Therefore, when the play begins with Lear rejecting his daughter, it can be interpreted as him rejecting death; Lear is unwilling to face the finitude of his being. The play&#x27;s poignant ending scene, wherein Lear carries the body of his beloved Cordelia, was of great importance to Freud. In this scene, Cordelia forces the realization of his finitude, or as Freud put it, she causes him to &quot;make friends with the necessity of dying&quot;.

Alternatively, an analysis based on Adlerian theory suggests that the King&#x27;s contest among his daughters in Act I has more to do with his control over the unmarried Cordelia. This theory indicates that the King&#x27;s &quot;dethronement&quot; might have led him to seek control that he lost after he divided his land.

In his study of the character-portrayal of Edmund, Harold Bloom refers to him as &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s most original character&quot;. &quot;As Hazlitt pointed out&quot;, writes Bloom, &quot;Edmund does not share in the hypocrisy of Goneril and Regan: his Machiavellianism is absolutely pure, and lacks an Oedipal motive. Freud&#x27;s vision of family romances simply does not apply to Edmund. Iago is free to reinvent himself every minute, yet Iago has strong passions, however negative. Edmund has no passions whatsoever; he has never loved anyone, and he never will. In that respect, he is Shakespeare&#x27;s most original character.&quot;

The tragedy of Lear&#x27;s lack of understanding of the consequences of his demands and actions is often observed to be like that of a spoiled child, but it has also been noted that his behaviour is equally likely to be seen in parents who have never adjusted to their children having grown up.

===Christianity===

Critics are divided on the question of whether &quot;King Lear&quot; represents an affirmation of a particular Christian doctrine. Those who think it does posit different arguments, which include the significance of Lear&#x27;s self-divestment. For some critics, this reflects the Christian concepts of the fall of the mighty and the inevitable loss of worldly possessions. By 1569, sermons delivered at court such as those at Windsor declared how &quot;rich men are rich dust, wise men wise dust... From him that weareth purple, and beareth the crown down to him that is clad with meanest apparel, there is nothing but garboil, and ruffle, and hoisting, and lingering wrath, and fear of death and death itself, and hunger, and many a whip of God.&quot; Some see this in Cordelia and what she symbolised—that the material body are mere husks that would eventually be discarded so that the fruit can be reached.

Among those who argue that Lear is redeemed in the Christian sense through suffering are A.C. Bradley and John Reibetanz, who has written: &quot;through his sufferings, Lear has won an enlightened soul&quot;. Other critics who find no evidence of redemption and emphasise the horrors of the final act include John Holloway and Marvin Rosenberg. William R. Elton stresses the pre-Christian setting of the play, writing that, &quot;Lear fulfills the criteria for pagan behavior in life,&quot; falling &quot;into total blasphemy at the moment of his irredeemable loss&quot;. This is related to the way some sources cite that at the end of the narrative, King Lear raged against heaven before eventually dying in despair with the death of Cordelia.

Harold Bloom argues that &quot;King Lear&quot; transcends a morality system entirely, and thus is one of the major triumphs of the play. Bloom writes that in the play there is, &quot;... no theology, no metaphysics, no ethics&quot;.

==Performance history==
&quot;King Lear&quot; has been performed by esteemed actors since the 17th century, when men played all the roles. From the 20th century, a number of women have played male roles in the play, most commonly the Fool, who has been played (among others) by Judy Davis, Emma Thompson and Robyn Nevin. Lear himself has been played by Marianne Hoppe in 1990, by Janet Wright in 1995, by Kathryn Hunter in 1996–97, and by Glenda Jackson in 2016 and 2019.

=== 17th century ===

Shakespeare wrote the role of Lear for his company&#x27;s chief tragedian, Richard Burbage, for whom Shakespeare was writing incrementally older characters as their careers progressed. It has been speculated either that the role of the Fool was written for the company&#x27;s clown Robert Armin, or that it was written for performance by one of the company&#x27;s boys, doubling the role of Cordelia. Only one specific performance of the play during Shakespeare&#x27;s lifetime is known: before the court of King James I at Whitehall on 26 December 1606. Its original performances would have been at The Globe, where there were no sets in the modern sense, and characters would have signified their roles visually with props and costumes: Lear&#x27;s costume, for example, would have changed in the course of the play as his status diminished: commencing in crown and regalia; then as a huntsman; raging bareheaded in the storm scene; and finally crowned with flowers in parody of his original status.

All theatres were closed down by the Puritan government on 6 September 1642. Upon the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, two patent companies (the King&#x27;s Company and the Duke&#x27;s Company) were established, and the existing theatrical repertoire divided between them. And from the restoration until the mid-19th century the performance history of &quot;King Lear&quot; is not the story of Shakespeare&#x27;s version, but instead of &quot;The History of King Lear&quot;, a popular adaptation by Nahum Tate. Its most significant deviations from Shakespeare were to omit the Fool entirely, to introduce a happy ending in which Lear and Cordelia survive, and to develop a love story between Cordelia and Edgar (two characters who never interact in Shakespeare) which ends with their marriage. Like most Restoration adapters of Shakespeare, Tate admired Shakespeare&#x27;s natural genius but saw fit to augment his work with contemporary standards of art (which were largely guided by the neoclassical unities of time, place, and action). Tate&#x27;s struggle to strike a balance between raw nature and refined art is apparent in his description of the tragedy: &quot;a heap of jewels, unstrung and unpolish&#x27;t; yet so dazzling in their disorder, that I soon perceiv&#x27;d I had seiz&#x27;d a treasure.&quot; Other changes included giving Cordelia a &quot;confidante&quot; named Arante, bringing the play closer to contemporary notions of poetic justice, and adding titilating material such as amorous encounters between Edmund and both Regan and Goneril, a scene in which Edgar rescues Cordelia from Edmund&#x27;s attempted kidnapping and rape, and a scene in which Cordelia wears men&#x27;s pants that would reveal the actress&#x27;s ankles. The play ends with a celebration of &quot;the King&#x27;s blest Restauration&quot;, an obvious reference to Charles II.

=== 18th century ===
In the early 18th century, some writers began to express objections to this (and other) Restoration adaptations of Shakespeare. For example, in &quot;The Spectator&quot; on 16 April 1711 Joseph Addison wrote &quot;&quot;King Lear&quot; is an admirable Tragedy ... as &quot;Shakespeare&quot; wrote it; but as it is reformed according to the chymerical Notion of poetical Justice in my humble Opinion it hath lost half its Beauty.&quot; Yet on the stage, Tate&#x27;s version prevailed.

David Garrick was the first actor-manager to begin to cut back on elements of Tate&#x27;s adaptation in favour of Shakespeare&#x27;s original: he retained Tate&#x27;s major changes, including the happy ending, but removed many of Tate&#x27;s lines, including Edgar&#x27;s closing speech. He also reduced the prominence of the Edgar-Cordelia love story, in order to focus more on the relationship between Lear and his daughters. His version had a powerful emotional impact: Lear driven to madness by his daughters was (in the words of one spectator, Arthur Murphy) &quot;the finest tragic distress ever seen on any stage&quot; and, in contrast, the devotion shown to Lear by Cordelia (a mix of Shakespeare&#x27;s, Tate&#x27;s and Garrick&#x27;s contributions to the part) moved the audience to tears.

The first professional performances of &quot;King Lear&quot; in North America are likely to have been those of the Hallam Company (later the American Company) which arrived in Virginia in 1752 and who counted the play among their repertoire by the time of their departure for Jamaica in 1774.

=== 19th century ===
Charles Lamb established the Romantics&#x27; attitude to &quot;King Lear&quot; in his 1811 essay &quot;On the Tragedies of Shakespeare, considered with reference to their fitness for stage representation&quot; where he says that the play &quot;is essentially impossible to be represented on the stage&quot;, preferring to experience it in the study. In the theatre, he argues, &quot;to see Lear acted, to see an old man tottering about the stage with a walking-stick, turned out of doors by his daughters on a rainy night, has nothing in it but what is painful and disgusting&quot; yet &quot;while we read it, we see not Lear but we are Lear,—we are in his mind, we are sustained by a grandeur which baffles the malice of daughters and storms.&quot; Literary critic Janet Ruth Heller elaborates on the hostility of Lamb, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and William Hazlitt to performances of tragedy, especially Shakespearean tragedy. They believed that such stagings appealed more to the senses than the imagination. However, reading stimulates the imagination. Also, Heller traces the history of the idea that tragedy should be read, not performed, back to Plato and to misreadings of Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Poetics&quot;. See &quot;Coleridge, Lamb, Hazlitt, and the Reader of Drama&quot;, University of Missouri Press, 1990).

&quot;King Lear&quot; was politically controversial during the period of George III&#x27;s madness, and as a result was not performed at all in the two professional theatres of London from 1811 to 1820: but was then the subject of major productions in both, within three months of his death. The 19th century saw the gradual reintroduction of Shakespeare&#x27;s text to displace Tate&#x27;s version. Like Garrick before him, John Philip Kemble had introduced more of Shakespeare&#x27;s text, while still preserving the three main elements of Tate&#x27;s version: the love story, the omission of the Fool, and the happy ending. Edmund Kean played &quot;King Lear&quot; with its tragic ending in 1823, but failed and reverted to Tate&#x27;s crowd-pleaser after only three performances. At last in 1838, William Macready at Covent Garden performed Shakespeare&#x27;s version, freed from Tate&#x27;s adaptions. The restored character of the Fool was played by an actress, Priscilla Horton, as, in the words of one spectator, &quot;a fragile, hectic, beautiful-faced, half-idiot-looking boy&quot;. And Helen Faucit&#x27;s final appearance as Cordelia, dead in her father&#x27;s arms, became one of the most iconic of Victorian images. John Forster, writing in the &quot;Examiner&quot; on 14 February 1838, expressed the hope that &quot;Mr Macready&#x27;s success has banished that disgrace [Tate&#x27;s version] from the stage for ever.&quot; But even this version was not close to Shakespeare&#x27;s: the 19th-century actor-managers heavily cut Shakespeare&#x27;s scripts: ending scenes on big &quot;curtain effects&quot; and reducing or eliminating supporting roles to give greater prominence to the star. One of Macready&#x27;s innovations—the use of Stonehenge-like structures on stage to indicate an ancient setting—proved enduring on stage into the 20th century, and can be seen in the 1983 television version starring Laurence Olivier.

In 1843, the Act for Regulating the Theatres came into force, bringing an end to the monopolies of the two existing companies and, by doing so, increased the number of theatres in London. At the same time, the fashion in theatre was &quot;pictorial&quot;: valuing visual spectacle above plot or characterisation and often required lengthy (and time-consuming) scene changes. For example, Henry Irving&#x27;s 1892 &quot;King Lear&quot; offered spectacles such as Lear&#x27;s death beneath a cliff at Dover, his face lit by the red glow of a setting sun; at the expense of cutting 46% of the text, including the blinding of Gloucester. But Irving&#x27;s production clearly evoked strong emotions: one spectator, Gordon Crosse, wrote of the first entrance of Lear, &quot;a striking figure with masses of white hair. He is leaning on a huge scabbarded sword which he raises with a wild cry in answer to the shouted greeting of his guards. His gait, his looks, his gestures, all reveal the noble, imperious mind already degenerating into senile irritability under the coming shocks of grief and age.&quot;

The importance of pictorialism to Irving, and to other theatre professionals of the Victorian era, is exemplified by the fact that Irving had used Ford Madox Brown&#x27;s painting &quot;Cordelia&#x27;s Portion&quot; as the inspiration for the look of his production, and that the artist himself was brought in to provide sketches for the settings of other scenes. A reaction against pictorialism came with the rise of the reconstructive movement, believers in a simple style of staging more similar to that which would have pertained in renaissance theatres, whose chief early exponent was the actor-manager William Poel. Poel was influenced by a performance of &quot;King Lear&quot; directed by Jocza Savits at the Hoftheater in Munich in 1890, set on an apron stage with a three-tier Globe—like reconstruction theatre as its backdrop. Poel would use this same configuration for his own Shakespearean performances in 1893.

=== 20th century ===
By mid-century, the actor–manager tradition had declined, to be replaced by a structure in which the major theatre companies employed professional directors as auteurs. The last of the great actor–managers, Donald Wolfit, played Lear in 1944 on a Stonehenge-like set and was praised by James Agate as &quot;the greatest piece of Shakespearean acting since I have been privileged to write for the &quot;Sunday Times&quot;&quot;. Wolfit supposedly drank eight bottles of Guinness in the course of each performance.

The character of Lear in the 19th century was often that of a frail old man from the opening scene, but Lears of the 20th century often began the play as strong men displaying regal authority, including John Gielgud, Donald Wolfit and Donald Sinden. Cordelia, also, evolved in the 20th century: earlier Cordelias had often been praised for being sweet, innocent and modest, but 20th-century Cordelias were often portrayed as war leaders. For example, Peggy Ashcroft, at the RST in 1950, played the role in a breastplate and carrying a sword. Similarly, the Fool evolved through the course of the century, with portrayals often deriving from the music hall or circus tradition.

At Stratford-upon-Avon in 1962 Peter Brook (who would later film the play with the same actor, Paul Scofield, in the role of Lear) set the action simply, against a huge, empty white stage. The effect of the scene when Lear and Gloucester meet, two tiny figures in rags in the midst of this emptiness, was said (by the scholar Roger Warren) to catch &quot;both the human pathos ... and the universal scale ... of the scene&quot;. Some of the lines from the radio broadcast were used by The Beatles to add into the recorded mix of the song &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot;. John Lennon happened upon the play on the BBC Third Programme while fiddling with the radio while working on the song. The voices of actors Mark Dignam, Philip Guard, and John Bryning from the play are all heard in the song.

Like other Shakespearean tragedies, &quot;King Lear&quot; has proved amenable to conversion into other theatrical traditions. In 1989, David McRuvie and Iyyamkode Sreedharan adapted the play then translated it to Malayalam, for performance in Kerala in the Kathakali tradition—which itself developed around 1600, contemporary with Shakespeare&#x27;s writing. The show later went on tour, and in 2000 played at Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe, completing, according to Anthony Dawson, &quot;a kind of symbolic circle&quot;. Perhaps even more radical was Ong Keng Sen&#x27;s 1997 adaptation of &quot;King Lear&quot;, which featured six actors each performing in a separate Asian acting tradition and in their own separate languages. A pivotal moment occurred when the Jingju performer playing Older Daughter (a conflation of Goneril and Regan) stabbed the Noh-performed Lear whose &quot;falling pine&quot; deadfall, straight face-forward into the stage, astonished the audience, in what Yong Li Lan describes as a &quot;triumph through the moving power of &quot;noh&quot; performance at the very moment of his character&#x27;s defeat&quot;.

In 1974, Buzz Goodbody directed &quot;Lear&quot;, a deliberately abbreviated title for Shakespeare&#x27;s text, as the inaugural production of the RSC&#x27;s studio theatre The Other Place. The performance was conceived as a chamber piece, the small intimate space and proximity to the audience enabled detailed psychological acting, which was performed with simple sets and in modern dress. Peter Holland has speculated that this company/directoral decision—namely &quot;choosing&quot; to present Shakespeare in a small venue for artistic reasons when a larger venue was available—may at the time have been unprecedented.

Brook&#x27;s earlier vision of the play proved influential, and directors have gone further in presenting Lear as (in the words of R. A. Foakes) &quot;a pathetic senior citizen trapped in a violent and hostile environment&quot;. When John Wood took the role in 1990, he played the later scenes in clothes that looked like cast-offs, inviting deliberate parallels with the uncared-for in modern Western societies. Indeed, modern productions of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays often reflect the world in which they are performed as much as the world for which they were written: and the Moscow theatre scene in 1994 provided an example, when two very different productions of the play (those by Sergei Zhonovach and Alexei Borodin), very different from one another in their style and outlook, were both reflections on the break-up of the Soviet Union.

=== 21st century ===
In 2002 and 2010, the Hudson Shakespeare Company of New Jersey staged separate productions as part of their respective Shakespeare in the Parks seasons. The 2002 version was directed by Michael Collins and transposed the action to a West Indies, nautical setting. Actors were featured in outfits indicative of looks of various Caribbean islands. The 2010 production directed by Jon Ciccarelli was fashioned after the atmosphere of the film &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; with a palette of reds and blacks and set the action in an urban setting. Lear (Tom Cox) appeared as a head of multi-national conglomerate who divided up his fortune among his socialite daughter Goneril (Brenda Scott), his officious middle daughter Regan (Noelle Fair) and university daughter Cordelia (Emily Best).

In 2012, renowned Canadian director Peter Hinton directed an all-First Nations production of &quot;King Lear&quot; at the National Arts Centre in Ottawa, Ontario, with the setting changed to an Algonquin nation in the 17th century. The cast included August Schellenberg as Lear, Billy Merasty as Gloucester, Tantoo Cardinal as Regan, Kevin Loring as Edmund, Jani Lauzon in a dual role as Cordelia and the Fool, and Craig Lauzon as Kent. 

In 2015, Toronto&#x27;s Theatre Passe Muraille staged a production set in Upper Canada against the backdrop of the Upper Canada Rebellion of 1837. This production starred David Fox as Lear.

In the summer of 2015–2016, The Sydney Theatre Company staged &quot;King Lear&quot;, directed by Neil Armfield with Geoffrey Rush in the lead role and Robyn Nevin as the Fool. About the madness at the heart of the play, Rush said that for him &quot;it&#x27;s about finding the dramatic impact in the moments of his mania. What seems to work best is finding a vulnerability or a point of empathy, where an audience can look at Lear and think how shocking it must be to be that old and to be banished from your family into the open air in a storm. That&#x27;s a level of impoverishment you would never want to see in any other human being, ever.&quot;

In 2016, Talawa Theatre Company and Royal Exchange Manchester co-produced a production of &quot;King Lear&quot; with Don Warrington in the title role. The production, featuring a largely black cast, was described in &quot;The Guardian&quot; as being &quot;as close to definitive as can be&quot;. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; wrote that &quot;Don Warrington&#x27;s King Lear is a heartbreaking tour de force&quot;. &quot;King Lear&quot; was staged by Royal Shakespeare Company, with Antony Sher in the lead role. The performance was directed by Gregory Doran and was described as having &quot;strength and depth&quot;.

In 2017, the Guthrie Theater produced a production of &quot;King Lear&quot; with Stephen Yoakam in the title role. Armin Shimerman appeared as the fool, portraying it with &quot;an unusual grimness, but it works&quot;, in a production that was hailed as &quot;a devastating piece of theater, and a production that does it justice&quot;.

&quot;King Lear&quot; was part of the Stratford Festival&#x27;s 2023 season, with Paul Gross playing the title role. The production was directed by Kimberley Rampersad, and was set in &quot;The near future. A kingdom on the precipice.&quot;

In October 2023, a new production directed by and starring Kenneth Branagh, set in Neolithic Britain, began a strictly limited run in London&#x27;s West End and was transferred to The Shed in New York City in October 2024. A version in modern dress was mounted in February 2024 at the Almeida Theatre, directed by Yaël Farber. The production featured a much younger Lear, portrayed by Danny Sapani, alongside Clarke Peters as the Fool, Fra Fee as Edmund, Gloria Obianyo as Cordelia, Matthew Tennyson as Edgar, and Alec Newman as Kent.

==Adaptations==
===Film and video===
The first film adaptation of &quot;King Lear&quot; was a five-minute German version made around 1905, which has not survived. The oldest extant version is a ten-minute studio-based version from 1909 by Vitagraph, which, according to Luke McKernan, made the &quot;ill-advised&quot; decision to attempt to cram in as much of the plot as possible. Two silent versions, both titled &quot;Re Lear&quot;, were made in Italy in 1910. Of these, the version by director Gerolamo Lo Savio was filmed on location, and it dropped the Edgar sub-plot and used frequent intertitling to make the plot easier to follow than its Vitagraph predecessor. A contemporary setting was used for Louis Feuillade&#x27;s 1911 French adaptation &quot;Le Roi Lear Au Village&quot;, and in 1914 in America, Ernest Warde expanded the story to an hour, including spectacles such as a final battle scene.

The Joseph Mankiewicz (1949) &quot;House of Strangers&quot; is often considered a &quot;Lear&quot; adaptation, but the parallels are more striking in &quot;Broken Lance&quot; (1954) in which a cattle baron played by Spencer Tracy tyrannizes his three sons, and only the youngest, Joe, played by Robert Wagner, remains loyal.

The TV anthology series &quot;Omnibus&quot; (1952–1961) staged a 73-minute version of &quot;King Lear&quot; on 18 October 1953. It was adapted by Peter Brook and starred Orson Welles in his American television debut.

Two screen versions of &quot;King Lear&quot; date from the early 1970s: Grigori Kozintsev&#x27;s &quot;Korol Lir&quot;, and Peter Brook&#x27;s film of &quot;King Lear&quot;, which stars Paul Scofield. Brook&#x27;s film starkly divided the critics: Pauline Kael said &quot;I didn&#x27;t just dislike this production, I hated it!&quot; and suggested the alternative title &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot;. Yet Robert Hatch in &quot;The Nation&quot; thought it as &quot;excellent a filming of the play as one can expect&quot; and Vincent Canby in &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;an exalting &quot;Lear&quot;, full of exquisite terror&quot;. The film drew on the ideas of Jan Kott, in particular his observation that &quot;King Lear&quot; was the precursor of absurdist theatre, and that it has parallels with Beckett&#x27;s &quot;Endgame&quot;. Critics who dislike the film particularly draw attention to its bleak nature from its opening: complaining that the world of the play does not deteriorate with Lear&#x27;s suffering, but commences dark, colourless and wintry, leaving, according to Douglas Brode, &quot;Lear, the land, and us with nowhere to go&quot;. Cruelty pervades the film, which does not distinguish between the violence of ostensibly good and evil characters, presenting both savagely. Paul Scofield, as Lear, eschews sentimentality: This demanding old man with a coterie of unruly knights provokes audience sympathy for the daughters in the early scenes, and his presentation explicitly rejects the tradition of playing Lear as &quot;poor old white-haired patriarch&quot;.

&quot;Korol Lir&quot; has been praised by critic Alexander Anikst for the &quot;serious, deeply thoughtful&quot; even &quot;philosophical approach&quot; of director Grigori Kozintsev and writer Boris Pasternak. Making a thinly veiled criticism of Brook in the process, Anikst praised the fact that there were &quot;no attempts at sensationalism, no efforts to &#x27;modernise&#x27; Shakespeare by introducing Freudian themes, Existentialist ideas, eroticism, or sexual perversion. [Kozintsev] ... has simply made a film of Shakespeare&#x27;s tragedy.&quot; Dmitri Shostakovich provided an epic score, its motifs including an (increasingly ironic) trumpet fanfare for Lear, and a five-bar &quot;Call to Death&quot; marking each character&#x27;s demise. Kozintzev described his vision of the film as an ensemble piece: with Lear, played by a dynamic Jüri Järvet, as first among equals in a cast of fully developed characters. The film highlights Lear&#x27;s role as king by including his people throughout the film on a scale no stage production could emulate, charting the central character&#x27;s decline from their god to their helpless equal; his final descent into madness marked by his realisation that he has neglected the &quot;poor naked wretches&quot;. As the film progresses, ruthless characters—Goneril, Regan, Edmund—increasingly appear isolated in shots, in contrast to the director&#x27;s focus, throughout the film, on masses of human beings.

Jonathan Miller twice directed Michael Hordern in the title role for English television, the first for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Play of the Month&quot; in 1975 and the second for the &quot;BBC Television Shakespeare&quot; in 1982. Hordern received mixed reviews, and was considered a bold choice due to his history of taking much lighter roles. Also for English television, Laurence Olivier took the role in a 1983 TV production for Granada Television. It was his last screen appearance in a Shakespearean role.

In 1985, a major screen adaptation of the play appeared: &quot;Ran&quot;, directed by Akira Kurosawa. At the time the most expensive Japanese film ever made, it tells the story of Hidetora, a fictional 16th-century Japanese warlord, whose attempt to divide his kingdom among his three sons leads to an estrangement with the youngest, and ultimately most loyal, of them, and eventually to civil war. In contrast to the cold drab greys of Brook and Kozintsev, Kurosawa&#x27;s film is full of vibrant colour: external scenes in yellows, blues and greens, interiors in browns and ambers, and Emi Wada&#x27;s Oscar-winning colour-coded costumes for each family member&#x27;s soldiers. Hidetora has a back-story: a violent and ruthless rise to power, and the film portrays contrasting victims: the virtuous characters Sue and Tsurumaru who are able to forgive, and the vengeful Kaede (Mieko Harada), Hidetora&#x27;s daughter-in-law and the film&#x27;s Lady Macbeth-like villain.

A scene in which a character is threatened with blinding in the manner of Gloucester forms the climax of the 1973 parody horror &quot;Theatre of Blood&quot;. Comic use is made of Sir&#x27;s inability to physically carry any actress cast as Cordelia opposite his Lear in the 1983 film of the stage play &quot;The Dresser&quot;. John Boorman&#x27;s 1990 &quot;Where the Heart Is&quot; features a father who disinherits his three spoiled children. Francis Ford Coppola deliberately incorporated elements of &quot;Lear&quot; in his 1990 sequel &quot;The Godfather Part III&quot;, including Michael Corleone&#x27;s attempt to retire from crime throwing his domain into anarchy, and most obviously the death of his daughter in his arms. Parallels have also been drawn between Andy García&#x27;s character Vincent and both Edgar and Edmund, and between Talia Shire&#x27;s character Connie and Kaede in &quot;Ran&quot;.

In 1997, Jocelyn Moorhouse directed &quot;A Thousand Acres&quot;, based on Jane Smiley&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of the same name, set in 1990s Iowa. The film is described, by scholar Tony Howard, as the first adaptation to confront the play&#x27;s disturbing sexual dimensions. The story is told from the viewpoint of the elder two daughters, Ginny played by Jessica Lange and Rose played by Michelle Pfeiffer, who were sexually abused by their father as teenagers. Their younger sister Caroline, played by Jennifer Jason Leigh had escaped this fate and is ultimately the only one to remain loyal.

In 1998, the BBC produced a televised version, directed by Richard Eyre, of his award-winning 1997 Royal National Theatre production, starring Ian Holm as Lear. In March 2001, in a review originally posted to CultureVulture.net, critic Bob Wake observed that the production was &quot;of particular note for preserving Ian Holm’s celebrated stage performance in the title role. Stellar interpreters of Lear haven&#x27;t always been so fortunate.&quot; Wake added that other performances had been poorly documented because they suffered from technological problems (Orson Welles), eccentric televised productions (Paul Scofield), or were filmed when the actor playing Lear was unwell (Laurence Olivier).

The play was adapted to the world of gangsters in Don Boyd&#x27;s 2001 &quot;My Kingdom&quot;, a version which differs from all others in commencing with the Lear character, Sandeman, played by Richard Harris, in a loving relationship with his wife. But her violent death marks the start of an increasingly bleak and violent chain of events (influenced by co-writer Nick Davies&#x27; documentary book &quot;Dark Heart&quot;) which in spite of the director&#x27;s denial that the film had &quot;serious parallels&quot; to Shakespeare&#x27;s play, actually mirror aspects of its plot closely.

Unlike Shakespeare&#x27;s Lear, but like Hidetora and Sandeman, the central character of Uli Edel&#x27;s 2002 American TV adaptation &quot;King of Texas&quot;, John Lear played by Patrick Stewart, has a back-story centred on his violent rise to power as the richest landowner (metaphorically a &quot;king&quot;) in General Sam Houston&#x27;s independent Texas in the early 1840s. Daniel Rosenthal comments that the film was able, by reason of having been commissioned by the cable channel TNT, to include a bleaker and more violent ending than would have been possible on the national networks. 2003&#x27;s Channel 4-commissioned two-parter &quot;Second Generation&quot; set the story in the world of Asian manufacturing and music in England.

The Canadian comedy-drama TV series &quot;Slings &amp; Arrows&quot; (2003–2006), which follows a fictional Shakespearean theatre festival inspired by the real-life Stratford Festival in Ontario, devotes its third season to a troubled production of &quot;King Lear&quot;. The fictional actor starring as Lear (played by William Hutt, who in real life played Lear onstage at Stratford three times to great acclaim) is given the role despite concerns over his advanced age and ill health, plus a secret addiction to heroin discovered by the theatre&#x27;s director. Eventually the actor&#x27;s mental state deteriorates until he seems to believe he is Lear himself, wandering into a storm and later reciting his lines uncontrollably. William Hutt himself was in failing health when he filmed the TV role and died less than a year after the third season premiered.

In 2008, a version of &quot;King Lear&quot; produced by the Royal Shakespeare Company premiered with Ian McKellen in the role of King Lear.

In the 2012 romantic comedy &quot;If I Were You&quot;, there is a reference to the play when the lead characters are cast in a female version of King Lear set in modern times, with Marcia Gay Harden cast in the Lear role and Leonor Watling as &quot;the fool&quot;. Lear is an executive in a corporate empire instead of a literal one, being phased out of her position. The off-beat play (and its cast) is a major plot element of the movie. The American musical drama television series &quot;Empire&quot; is partially inspired by &quot;King Lear&quot;.

Carl Bessai wrote and directed a modern adaptation of &quot;King Lear&quot; titled &quot;The Lears&quot;. Released in 2017, the film starred Bruce Dern, Anthony Michael Hall and Sean Astin.

On 28 May 2018, BBC Two broadcast &quot;King Lear&quot; starring Anthony Hopkins in the title role and Emma Thompson as Goneril. Directed by Richard Eyre, the play featured a 21st-century setting. Hopkins, at the age of 80, was deemed ideal for the role and &quot;at home with Lear&#x27;s skin&quot; by critic Sam Wollaston.

===Radio and audio===
The first recording of the Argo Shakespeare for Argo Records was &quot;King Lear&quot; in 1957, directed and produced by George Rylands with William Devlin in the title role, Jill Balcon as Goneril and Prunella Scales as Cordelia.

The Shakespeare Recording Society recorded a full-length unabridged audio productions on LP in 1965 (SRS-M-232) directed by Howard Sackler, with Paul Scofield as Lear, Cyril Cusack as Gloucester. Robert Stephens as Edmund, Rachel Roberts, Pamela Brown and John Stride.

&quot;King Lear&quot; was broadcast live on the BBC Third Programme on 29 September 1967, starring John Gielgud, Barbara Jefford, Barbara Bolton and Virginia McKenna as Lear and his daughters. At Abbey Road Studios, John Lennon used a microphone held to a radio to overdub fragments of the play (Act IV, Scene 6) onto the song &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot;, which The Beatles were recording that evening. The voices recorded were those of Mark Dignam (Gloucester), Philip Guard (Edgar) and John Bryning (Oswald).

On 10 April 1994, Kenneth Branagh&#x27;s Renaissance Theatre Company performed a radio adaptation directed by Glyn Dearman starring Gielgud as Lear, with Keith Michell as Kent, Richard Briers as Gloucester, Dame Judi Dench as Goneril, Emma Thompson as Cordelia, Eileen Atkins as Regan, Kenneth Branagh as Edmund, John Shrapnel as Albany, Robert Stephens as Cornwall, Denis Quilley as Burgundy, Sir Derek Jacobi as France, Iain Glen as Edgar and Michael Williams as The Fool.

<text>A gentlemen&#x27;s agreement, or gentleman&#x27;s agreement, is an informal and legally non-binding between two or more parties. It is typically oral, but it may be written or simply understood as part of an unspoken agreement by convention or through mutually beneficial etiquette. The essence of a gentlemen&#x27;s agreement is that it relies upon the honor of the parties for its fulfillment, rather than being in any way enforceable. It is distinct from a legal agreement or contract. A more formal (but still non-binding) form of the gentlemen&#x27;s agreement is the memorandum of understanding.

==History==
The phrase appears in the British parliamentary records in 1821 and in the Massachusetts public records in 1835. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; cites P. G. Wodehouse&#x27;s 1929 story collection &quot;Mr Mulliner Speaking&quot; as the first appearance of the term.

===Industry===
A gentleman&#x27;s agreement, defined in the early 20th century as &quot;an agreement between gentlemen looking toward the control of prices,&quot; was reported by one source to be the loosest form of a &quot;pool.&quot; Such agreements have been reported to be found in every type of industry and were numerous in the American steel and iron industries of the early 20th century.

A report from the United States House of Representatives detailing their investigation of the United States Steel Corporation asserted that there were two general types of loose associations or consolidations between steel and iron interests in the 1890s in which the individual concerns retained ownership as well as a large degree of independence: the &quot;pool&quot; and the &quot;gentleman&#x27;s agreement.&quot; The latter type lacked any formal organization to regulate output or prices or any provisions for forfeiture in the event of an infraction. The efficacy of the agreement relied on members to keep informal pledges.

In the automotive industry, Japanese manufacturers agreed that no production car would have more than 276 bhp (; ); the agreement ended in 2005. German manufacturers limit the top speed of high-performance saloons (sedans) and station wagons to . Some automakers, such as Mercedes-Benz, offer options to increase or remove the speed limiter. When the Suzuki Hayabusa motorcycle exceeded in 1999, fears of a European ban or regulatory crackdown led Japanese and European motorcycle makers to agree to a limit of 300 km/h (186 mph) in late 1999. &quot;See List of fastest production motorcycles&quot;.

===International relations===
After intense anti-Japanese sentiment developed on the West Coast, US President Theodore Roosevelt did not want to anger Japan by supporting legislation to bar Japanese immigration to the United States, as had been done for Chinese immigration. Instead, there was an informal &quot;Gentlemen&#x27;s Agreement&quot; (1907–8) and a corresponding informal Ladies&#x27; Agreement between the United States and Japan, whereby Japan made sure there was very little or no movement to the US. The agreements were made by US Secretary of State Elihu Root and Japan&#x27;s Foreign Minister, Tadasu Hayashi. The agreement banned emigration of Japanese laborers to the United States and rescinded the segregation order of the San Francisco School Board in California, which had humiliated and angered the Japanese. The agreement did not apply to the Territory of Hawaii. The agreements remained effective until 1924, when Congress forbade all immigration from Japan. Similar anti-Japanese sentiment in Canada at the same time led to the Hayashi-Lemieux Agreement, also referred to as the &quot;Gentlemen&#x27;s Agreement of 1908&quot;, with substantially similar clauses and effects.

===Trade policies===
Gentlemen&#x27;s agreements have come to regulate international activities such as the coordination of monetary or trade policies. According to Edmund Osmańczyk in the &quot;Encyclopedia of the United Nations and International Agreements&quot;, it is also defined as &quot;an international term for an agreement made orally rather than in writing, yet fully legally valid&quot;. This type of agreement may allow a nation to avoid the domestic legal requirements to enter into a formal treaty, or it may be useful when a government wants to enter into a secret agreement that is not binding upon the next administration. According to another author, all international agreements are gentlemen&#x27;s agreements because, short of war, they are &quot;all&quot; unenforceable. Osmańczyk pointed out that there is a difference between open gentlemen&#x27;s agreements and secret diplomatic agreements. In the United States, a prohibition against gentlemen&#x27;s agreements in commercial relations between states was introduced in 1890, because the secretive nature of such agreements was beyond anyone&#x27;s control.

In English contract law, for an agreement to be binding, there must be an intention to create legal relations; but in commercial dealings (i.e. agreements that are not between family members or friends) there is a legal presumption of an &quot;intention to create legal relations&quot;. However, in the 1925 case of &quot;Rose &amp; Frank Co v JR Crompton &amp; Bros Ltd&quot;, the House of Lords held that the phrase, &quot;This arrangement is not ... a formal or legal agreement ... but is only a record of the intention of the parties&quot; was sufficient to rebut the said presumption.

===As a discriminatory tactic===

Gentlemen&#x27;s agreements were a widely used discriminatory tactic reportedly more common than restrictive covenants in preserving the homogeneity of upper-class neighborhoods and suburbs in the United States. The nature of these agreements made them extremely difficult to prove or to track, and were effective long after the United States Supreme Court&#x27;s rulings in &quot;Shelley v. Kraemer&quot; and &quot;Barrows v. Jackson&quot;. A 1995 source stated that gentlemen&#x27;s agreements &quot;undoubtedly still exist&quot;, but that their use had greatly diminished.

Until Jackie Robinson was hired by the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1946, a gentlemen&#x27;s agreement ensured that African American players were excluded from organized baseball.

<doc id="55727" wikidata="Q9367416" url="?curid=55727" title="Newlands Reclamation Act">
<text>The Reclamation Act (also known as the Lowlands Reclamation Act or National Reclamation Act) of 1902 () is a United States federal law that funded irrigation projects for the arid lands of 17 states in the American West.

The act at first covered only 16 of the western states, as delineated by the 100th meridian, as Texas had no federal lands. Texas was added later by a special act passed in 1906. The act set aside money from sales of semi-arid public lands for the construction and maintenance of irrigation projects. The newly irrigated land would be sold and money would be put into a revolving fund that supported more such projects. These irrigation projects led to the eventual damming of nearly every major western river. Under the act, the Secretary of the Interior created the &quot;United States Reclamation Service&quot; within the United States Geological Survey to administer the program. In 1907, the Service became a separate organization within the Department of the Interior and was renamed the United States Bureau of Reclamation.

The Act was co-authored by Democratic Congressional Representative Francis G. Newlands of Nevada, Frederick H. Newell of the United States Geological Survey, and George H. Maxwell, head of the National Reclamation Association. Many of the loans made to farmers, funded by the sales of federal land, were never repaid. Amendments made by the Reclamation Project Act of 1939 gave the Department of the Interior, among other things, the authority to amend repayment contracts and to extend repayment for not more than 40 years. Amendments made by the Reclamation Reform Act of 1982 (P.L. 97-293) eliminated the residency requirement provisions of reclamation law, raised the acreage limitation on lands irrigated with water supplied by the Bureau of Reclamation, and established and required full-cost rates for land receiving water above the acreage limit.

==Background==
John Wesley Powell, arguably the &quot;father of reclamation&quot;, began a series of expeditions to explore the American West in 1867. He concluded that the Western United States was so arid that it could not yet support extensive development, and government involvement in large-scale irrigation would be necessary. Among his observations, he saw that, after snowmelt and spring rains, the rivers of the West flooded and released huge amounts of water and that for the rest of the year not enough rain fell to sufficiently support agriculture, and so reservoir dams were necessary. The U.S. government saw too much economic potential in the West to heed Powell&#x27;s advice, at the time.

By the late 1800s, small-scale private and local farming organizations would prove the benefits of irrigation projects in the arid western states. When it became apparent that an organized effort would be required to make agriculture viable in the West, Representative Francis G. Newlands of Nevada introduced legislation into the United States Congress to provide federal help and coordination for irrigation projects. Newlands carried the bulk of the legislative burden and had a strong technical backup from Frederick Haynes Newell of the Department of the Interior and George H. Maxwell, head of the National Reclamation Association. Conflict emerged over whether reclamation efforts ought to occur at the state level or at the federal level. President Theodore Roosevelt supported the national effort and assembled the legislative alliances that made passage of the act possible. After several years of effort, the resulting act passed on June 17, 1902.

The 1902 act was later amended by the Reclamation Reform Act of 1982 (, Title II) to limit the corporate use of water and speculation on land that would benefit from reclamation projects.

==Summary of the Act==
The full name of the act is &quot;An Act Appropriating the receipts from the sale and disposal of public lands in certain States and Territories to the construction of irrigation works for the reclamation of arid lands&quot;. The act identifies 16 states and territories included in the project: Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. It requires surplus fees from sales of land be set aside for a &quot;reclamation fund&quot; for the development of water resources. It also requires the Treasury Department to fund education from unappropriated monies under certain conditions.

* &quot;Wyoming:&quot; Shoshone, 164,122

Much of the West could not have been settled without the water provided by the Act. The West became one of the premier agricultural areas in the world. Bureau of Reclamation statistics shows that the more than 600 of their dams on waterways throughout the West provide irrigation for of farmland, providing 60% of the nation&#x27;s vegetables and 25% of its fruits and nuts. Currently, the Bureau operates about 180 projects in the West.

Not envisioned by the act, Bureau of Reclamation dams support 58 power plants producing 40 billion kilowatt hours of electricity annually. Most of the large population centers in the Far West owe their growth to these power sources.

<text>The Federal Meat Inspection Act of 1906 (FMIA) is an American law that makes it illegal to adulterate or misbrand meat and meat products being sold as food, and ensures that meat and meat products are slaughtered and processed under strictly regulated sanitary conditions. These requirements also apply to imported meat products, which must be inspected under equivalent foreign standards. United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) inspection of poultry was added by the Poultry Products Inspection Act of 1957 (PPIA). The Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act authorizes the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to provide inspection services for all livestock and poultry species not listed in the FMIA or PPIA, including venison and buffalo. The Agricultural Marketing Act authorizes the USDA to offer voluntary, fee-for-service inspection services for these same species.

== Historical motivation for enactment ==
The original 1906 Act authorized the Secretary of Agriculture to inspect and condemn any meat product found unfit for human consumption. Unlike previous laws ordering meat inspections, which were enforced to assure European nations from banning pork trade, this law was strongly motivated to protect the American diet. All labels on any type of food had to be accurate (although not all ingredients were provided on the label). Even though all harmful food was banned, many warnings were still provided on the container. The production date for canned meats was a requirement in the legislation that Senator Albert Beveridge introduced but it was later removed in the House bill that was passed and became law. The law was partly a response to the publication of Upton Sinclair&#x27;s &quot;The Jungle&quot;, an exposé of the Chicago meat packing industry, as well as to other Progressive Era muckraking publications of the day. While Sinclair&#x27;s dramatized account was intended to bring attention to the terrible working conditions in Chicago, the public was more horrified by the prospect of bad meat.
The book&#x27;s assertions were confirmed in the Neill-Reynolds report, commissioned by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1906. Roosevelt was suspicious of Sinclair&#x27;s socialist attitude and conclusions in &quot;The Jungle&quot;, so he sent labor commissioner Charles P. Neill and social worker James Bronson Reynolds, men whose honesty and reliability he trusted, to Chicago to make surprise visits to meat packing facilities.

Despite betrayal of the secret to the meat packers, who worked three shifts a day for three weeks to thwart the inspection, Neill and Reynolds were still revolted by the conditions at the factories and at the lack of concern by plant managers (though neither had much experience in the field). Following their report, Roosevelt became a supporter of regulation of the meat packing industry, and, on June 30, signed the Meat Inspection Act of 1906.

The FMIA mandated the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) inspection of meat processing plants that conducted business across state lines. The Pure Food and Drug Act, enacted on the same day (June 30, 1906), also gave the government broad jurisdiction over food in interstate commerce.

The four primary requirements of the Meat Inspection Act of 1906 were:

#Mandatory inspection of livestock before slaughter (cattle, sheep, goats, equines, and swine);
#Mandatory postmortem inspection of every carcass;
#Sanitary standards established for slaughterhouses and meat processing plants; and
#Authorized U.S. Department of Agriculture ongoing monitoring and inspection of slaughter and processing operations.

After 1906, many additional laws that further standardized the meat industry and its inspection were passed.

== Preemption of state law ==
In 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in &quot;National Meat Assn. v. Harris&quot;, that the FMIA preempts a California law regulating the treatment of non-ambulatory livestock.

<text>The , also known as the Wiley Act and [[Harvey Washington Wiley|Dr. Wiley]]&#x27;s Law, was the first of a series of significant consumer protection laws enacted by the United States Congress, and led to the creation of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Its main purpose was to ban foreign and interstate traffic in adulterated or mislabeled food and drug products, and it directed the US Bureau of Chemistry to inspect products and refer offenders to prosecutors. It required that active ingredients be placed on the label of a drug&#x27;s packaging and that drugs could not fall below purity levels established by the United States Pharmacopeia or the National Formulary.

In the late 1800s, the quality of food in the US decreased significantly as populations moved to cities and the time from farm to market increased. Many food producers turned to using dangerous preservatives, including formaldehyde, to keep food appearing fresh. Simultaneously, the quality of medicine was appalling. Quack medicine was common, and many drugs were addictive or dangerous without actually providing a curative effect. Opium and alcohol were chief ingredients, even in infant medicines. The work of muckraking journalists exposed the practices of food and drug industries and caused public outcry.

Foremost among such exposés was &quot;The Jungle&quot; by Upton Sinclair, published the same year as the act. With its graphic and revolting descriptions of unsanitary conditions and unscrupulous practices rampant in the meat-packing industry, it kept the public&#x27;s attention on the extreme unhygienic conditions in meat processing plants. Sinclair quipped, &quot;I aimed at the public&#x27;s heart and by accident I hit it in the stomach,&quot; as an outraged public demanded government action, resulting in the Pure Food and Drug Act and the Federal Meat Inspection Act of 1906.

==Historical significance==
The Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 was a key piece of Progressive Era legislation, signed by President Theodore Roosevelt on the same day as the Federal Meat Inspection Act. Enforcement of the Pure Food and Drug Act was assigned to the Bureau of Chemistry in the U.S. Department of Agriculture which was renamed the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1930. The Meat Inspection Act was assigned to what is now known as the Food Safety and Inspection Service, which remains in the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The first federal law regulating foods and drugs, the 1906 Act&#x27;s reach was limited to foods and drugs moving in interstate commerce. Although the law drew upon many precedents, provisions, and legal experiments pioneered in individual states, the federal law defined &quot;misbranding&quot; and &quot;adulteration&quot; for the first time and prescribed penalties for each. The law recognized the U.S. Pharmacopeia and the National Formulary as standards authorities for drugs, but made no similar provision for federal food standards. The law was principally a &quot;truth in labeling&quot; law designed to raise standards in the food and drug industries and protect the reputations and pocketbooks of honest businessmen.

==Particular drugs deemed addictive==
Under the law, drug labels, for example, had to list any of 10 ingredients that were deemed &quot;addictive&quot; and/or &quot;dangerous&quot; on the product label if they were present, and could not list them if they were not present. Alcohol, morphine, opium, and cannabis were all included on the list of these &quot;addictive&quot; and/or &quot;dangerous&quot; drugs. The law also established a federal cadre of food and drug inspectors that one Southern opponent of the legislation criticized as &quot;a Trojan horse with a bellyful of inspectors and other employees.&quot; Penalties under the law were modest, but an under-appreciated provision of the Act proved more powerful than monetary penalties. Goods found in violation of various areas of the law were subject to seizure and destruction at the expense of the manufacturer. That, combined with a legal requirement that all convictions be published as Notices of Judgment, proved to be important tools in the enforcement of the statute and had a deterrent effect upon would-be violators.

Deficiencies in this original statute, which had become noticeable by the 1920s, led to the replacement of the 1906 statute with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act which was enacted in 1938 and signed by President Franklin Roosevelt. This act, along with its numerous amendments, remains the statutory basis for federal regulation of all foods, drugs, biological products, cosmetics, medical devices, tobacco, and radiation-emitting devices by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

==History of passage==
An 1882 article in Scientific American describes &quot;New Laws for Analyzing Food and Drugs&quot; and highlights historical aspects. Part of the draft stated:&quot;An article shall be deemed to be adulterated within the meaning of this act.A.-In the case of drugs:* If, when sold under or by a name recognized in the United States Pharmacopeia, it differs from the standard of strength, quality, or purity laid down in such work.* If when sold under or by a name not recognized in the United States Pharmacopeia, but which is found in some other pharmacopeia or ether standard work on materia medica, it differs from the standard of strength, quality, or purity laid down in such work.* If its strength or purity fall below the professed standard under which it is soldB.-In the case of food or drink:* If any substance or substances has or have been mixed with it as to reduce or lower or injuriously affect its quality of strength* If any inferior or cheaper substance or substances have been substituted wholly or in part for the article*If any valuable constituent of the article has been wholly or is part abstracted* If it be an imitation of or be sold under the name of another article* If it consists wholly or in part of a diseased or decomposed, or putrid or rotten, animal or vegetable substance, whether manufactured or not, or in the case of milk, if it is the produce of a diseased animal* If it be colored, or coated, or polished, or powdered, whereby damage is concealed, or it is made to appear better than it really is, or of greater value&quot;―Scientific American, 7 Jan 1882

It took 27 years to adopt the 1906 statute, during which time the public was made aware of many problems with foods and drugs in the U.S. Muckraking journalists, such as Samuel Hopkins Adams, targeted the patent medicine industry with its high-alcoholic content patent medicines, soothing syrups for infants with opium derivatives, and &quot;red clauses&quot; in newspaper contracts providing that patent medicine ads (upon which most newspapers of the time were dependent) would be withdrawn if the paper expressed support for food and drug regulatory legislation.

The Chief Chemist of the Bureau of Chemistry, Dr. Harvey Washington Wiley, captured the country&#x27;s attention with his hygienic table studies, which began with a modest Congressional appropriation in 1902. The goal of the table trial was to study the human effects of common preservatives used in foods during a period of rapid changes in the food supply brought about by the need to feed cities and support an industrializing nation increasingly dependent on immigrant labor. Wiley recruited young men to eat all their meals at a common table as he added increased &quot;doses&quot; of preservatives including borax, benzoate, formaldehyde, sulfites, and salicylates. The table trials captured the nation&#x27;s fancy and were soon dubbed &quot;The Poison Squad&quot; by newspapers covering the story. The men soon adopted the motto &quot;Only the Brave dare eat the fare&quot; and at times the publicity given to the trials became a burden. Though many results of the trial came to be in dispute, there was no doubt that formaldehyde was dangerous and it disappeared quickly as a preservative. Wiley himself felt that he had found adverse effects from large doses of each of the preservatives and the public seemed to agree with Wiley. In many cases, most particularly with ketchup and other condiments, the use of preservatives was often used to disguise unsanitary production practices. Although the law itself did not proscribe the use of some of these preservatives, consumers increasingly turned away from many products with known preservatives.

The 1906 statute regulated food and drugs moving in interstate commerce and forbade the manufacture, sale, or transportation of poisonous patent medicines. The Act arose due to public education and exposés from public interest guardians such as Upton Sinclair and Samuel Hopkins Adams, social activist Florence Kelley, researcher Harvey W. Wiley, and President Theodore Roosevelt.

== Beginnings of the Food and Drug Administration==
The 1906 Act paved the way for the eventual creation of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is generally considered to be that agency&#x27;s founding date, though the agency existed before the law was passed and was not named FDA until later. &quot;While the Food and Drug act remains a foundational law of the FDA mission, it&#x27;s not the law that created the FDA. [Initially,] the Bureau of Chemistry (the precursor to the FDA) regulated food safety. In 1927, the Bureau was reorganized into the Food, Drug, and Insecticide Administration and the Bureau of Chemistry and Soils. The FDIA was renamed the FDA in 1930.&quot;

The law itself was largely replaced by the much more comprehensive Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938.

== Enforcement of labeling and future ramifications ==
The Pure Food and Drug Act was initially concerned with ensuring products were labeled correctly. Later efforts were made to outlaw certain products that were not safe, followed by efforts to outlaw products which were safe but not effective. For example, there was an attempt to outlaw Coca-Cola in 1909 because of its excessive caffeine content; caffeine had replaced cocaine as the active ingredient in Coca-Cola in 1903. In the case &quot;United States v. Forty Barrels and Twenty Kegs of Coca-Cola&quot;, the judge found that Coca-Cola had a right to use caffeine as it saw fit, although Coca-Cola eventually lost when the government appealed to the Supreme Court. It reached a settlement with the United States government to reduce the caffeine amount.

In addition to caffeine, the Pure Food and Drug Act required that drugs such as alcohol, cocaine, heroin, morphine, and cannabis, be accurately labeled with contents and dosage. Previously many drugs had been sold as patent medicines with secret ingredients or misleading labels. Cocaine, heroin, cannabis, and other such drugs continued to be legally available without prescription as long as they were labeled. It is estimated that sale of patent medicines containing opiates decreased by 33% after labeling was mandated. The Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 is cited by drug policy reform advocates such as Jim Gray as a successful model for re-legalization of currently prohibited drugs by requiring accurate labels, monitoring of purity and dose, and consumer education.

<text>The Aldrich–Vreeland Act was a United States law passed in response to the Panic of 1907 which established the National Monetary Commission.

On May 27, 1908, the bill passed the House, mostly on a party-line vote of 166–140, with 13 Republicans voting against it and no Democrats voting for it. On May 30, it passed in the Senate with 43 Republicans for the act and five Republicans joining the 17 Democrats against it. President Roosevelt signed the bill that same night.

The act also allowed national banks to start national currency associations in groups of ten or more, with at least $5 million in total capital, to issue emergency currency. The bank notes were to be backed by not only government bonds but also almost any securities the banks were holding. The act proposed that the emergency currency had to go through a process of approval by the officers of the national currency associations before they were distributed by the Comptroller of the Currency.

However, it is possible that because there was a 5 percent tax placed on this emergency currency for the first month it was &quot;outstanding&quot; and a 1 percent increase for the following months it was &quot;outstanding,&quot; no bank notes were issued. Another possible explanation that the emergency currency was never issued was that it was unnecessary.

Congress modified and extended the law in 1914 when British and other foreign creditors demanded immediate payments in gold in amounts that would ordinarily have been carried over and paid through exports of commodities.

Senator Nelson W. Aldrich (R-RI) was largely responsible for the Aldrich-Vreeland Currency Law and became the Chairman of the National Monetary commission. The co-sponsor of the legislation was Representative Edward Vreeland, a Republican from New York.

A usage of the law occurred at the outbreak of World War I in 1914 when the first great financial panic of the 20th century befell the world, necessitating the closure of the New York Stock Exchange. Secretary of the Treasury William Gibbs McAdoo appeared in New York City and assured the public that ample stocks of emergency banknotes had been prepared in accordance with the Aldrich–Vreeland Act and were available for issue to the banks. As of October 23, 1914, $368,616,990 was outstanding.

The Federal Reserve Act of December 23, 1913 took effect in November 1914, when the 12 regional banks opened for business. Ultimately, the emergency currency issued under the Aldrich-Vreeland Act was entirely withdrawn.

Economist Laurence J. Laughlin criticized the legislation, arguing that the authors of the bill have &quot;a lack of expert knowledge in regard to banking.&quot;

<text>The Elkins Act is a 1903 United States federal law that amended the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887. The Act authorized the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) to impose heavy fines on railroads that offered rebates, and upon the shippers that accepted these rebates. The railroad companies were not permitted to offer rebates. Railroad corporations, their officers, and their employees, were all made liable for discriminatory practices.

Prior to the Elkins Act, the livestock and petroleum industries paid standard rail shipping rates, but then would demand that the railroad company give them rebates. The railroad companies resented being extorted by the railroad trusts and therefore welcomed passage of the Elkins Act. The law was sponsored by President Theodore Roosevelt as a part of his &quot;Square Deal&quot; domestic program, and greatly boosted his popularity.

==Background==
Congress passed the Elkins Act as an amendment to the Interstate Commerce Act. Without restrictive legislation, large firms could demand rebates or prices below the collusive price from railroad companies as condition for their business. As a result, it was common practice for railroads to offer competitive lower rates for transport between the large cities with high density of firms than the monopolistic rates between less industrial cities, irrespective of length of travel. Trusts constituted such a substantial portion of a carrier&#x27;s revenue that the trusts could demand rebates as a condition for business, and the carrier would be forced to cooperate.

==Purpose==
The ICC had been unable to protect competition and fair pricing. Section 2 of the Interstate Commerce Act prohibits a carrier from offering preferential prices or rebates; however, enforcement of this section was ineffective. Powerful trusts would pay the standard shipping price, but demand a rebate from the carrier. Court cases brought before the commission generally did not result in punitive action, as the ICC was composed primarily of railroad interests. Carriers found guilty of price discrimination, moreover, could appeal the ICC decision to federal courts, delaying punishment for years.

The Elkins Act was named for its sponsor, Senator Stephen B. Elkins of West Virginia, who introduced a bill in 1902 at the behest of the Pennsylvania Railroad. The law was passed by the 57th Congress and signed by President Roosevelt on February 19, 1903. The Act made it a misdemeanor for a carrier to impose preferential rebates, and implicated both the carrier and the recipient of the low price. The Act also abolished imprisonment as a punishment for breaching the law, so a violator could only be fined. By reducing the severity of punishment, legislators hoped to encourage firms to testify against each other, and promote stricter enforcement of the law.

==Impact==
Following the passage of the Elkins Act, real freight rates decreased only slightly. In 1905, leaders in the regulation movement testified before Congress to identify the reduction in prices that resulted from the Act. Yet, in the first months following the passage of the law, the most pronounced change in railroad pricing was the elimination of rebates. However, later analysis has found that decreases in carrier prices are better attributable to decreases in the costs of operation due to technology advances. The elimination of rebates led the railroads to seek other methods to compete for business, leading Governor Albert B. Cummins of Iowa to declare, in 1905, that the elimination of rebates simply forces railroads to seek alternative noncompetitive means to secure business. The Elkins Act, thus, was more effective in stabilizing prices and entrenching price collusion than demonstrably lowering prices.

A diverse group of stakeholders publicly supported the Elkins Act. Citizens who supported the law hoped that reducing price discrimination would lower freight prices uniformly, and railroad interests lobbied for the passage of the Act as a means of enforcing collusive pricing. While the Act restricted preferential pricing, it did not specify what constituted a &quot;reasonable&quot; shipping rate; thus, railroads could use the law to entrench a system of collusive prices. Collusion is unsustainable in a market where it is easy to undercut competitors. However in industries that only have a small number of competitors (e.g. railroads, airlines, or transportation companies operating between two given cities) collusion is far more likely. The result of the Elkins Act was that railroads had a stronger mechanism to protect their collusive prices and corporate trusts were weakened in their ability to gain shipping discounts. Farmers and other railroad users, instead of benefiting from greater competition, were unaffected by the Act.

While farmers may have benefited from the establishment of a price ceiling on freight rates, the nature of the railroad industry may have not have permitted perfect competition. Economist Robert Harbeson argues that the price wars prior to the Elkins Act suggest that the railroad industry was more oligopolistic. In an industry with decreasing marginal costs and high fixed costs, it would be futile to enforce a price cap. Moreover, he argues, stronger regulation would have prevented carriers from reaching economies of scale.

==Contemporary criticism==
In reaction to the Elkins Act, it was argued that the law was drafted by Congress on behalf of the railroads, and that while some railroads curtailed rebates for some customers, for others the practice continued unabated. Congress was criticized for enacting only monetary fines for violations of the law and avoiding imposition of criminal penalties.

==Subsequent legislation==
Citing the shortcomings of the Elkins Act, Progressives began to call for greater regulation of railroad interests, and, in 1906, President Roosevelt signed the Hepburn Act to replace the Elkins Act. The Hepburn Act set maximum freight rates for railroads, representing the greater interests of Americans. The regulations of the Hepburn Act strained railroads, which saw new competition from the rise of trucks and automobiles. The Panic of 1907 was, in part, a result of the turmoil of the railroad industry that resulted from the Hepburn Act.

<text>The Hepburn Act is a 1906 United States federal law that expanded the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) and gave it the power to set maximum railroad rates. This led to the discontinuation of free passes to loyal shippers. In addition, the ICC could view the railroads&#x27; financial records, a task simplified by standardized bookkeeping systems. For any railroad that resisted, the ICC&#x27;s conditions would remain in effect until the outcome of legislation said otherwise. By the Hepburn Act, the ICC&#x27;s authority was extended to cover bridges, terminals, ferries, railroad sleeping cars, express companies and oil pipelines.

==Overview==
The Hepburn Act was named for its sponsor, ten-term Iowa Republican congressman William Peters Hepburn. The final version was close to what President Theodore Roosevelt had asked for, and it easily passed Congress, with only three dissenting votes. The Act, along with the Elkins Act of 1903, was a component of one of Roosevelt&#x27;s major policy goals: railroad regulation.

The most important provision of the law gave the ICC price control power to replace existing rates with &quot;just-and-reasonable&quot; maximum rates, and authorized the Commission to define what was just and reasonable. The Act made ICC orders binding; that is, the railroads had to either obey or contest the ICC orders in federal court. To speed the rate-setting process, the Act specified that appeals from rulings of the district courts would go directly to the U.S. Supreme Court.

Anti-rebate provisions were toughened, free passes were outlawed, and the penalties for violation were increased. The ICC staff grew from 104 in 1890 to 178 in 1905, 330 in 1907, and 527 in 1909. Finally, the ICC gained the power to prescribe a uniform system of accounting, require standardized reports, and inspect railroad accounts.

The limitation on railroad rates depreciated the value of railroad securities, a factor in causing the Panic of 1907.

==Significance==
Scholars consider the Hepburn Act the most important piece of legislation affecting railroads in the first half of the 20th century. Economists and historians debate whether it crippled the railroads, giving so much advantage to the shippers that a giant unregulated trucking industry—undreamed of in 1906—eventually took away their business.

==Follow-up legislation==
Congress passed the Mann–Elkins Act in 1910 during the administration of President William Howard Taft, to address limitations in implementation of the Hepburn Act. The Mann–Elkins Act authorized the ICC to initiate reviews of railroad rate increases, rather than simply responding to complaints from shippers. The 1910 law empowered the ICC to set &quot;just and reasonable&quot; maximum rates and placed the burden of proof upon the railroad for demonstrating reasonableness.

<text>The Payne–Aldrich Tariff Act of 1909 (ch. 6, 36 Stat. 11), named for Representative Sereno E. Payne (R–NY) and Senator Nelson W. Aldrich (R–RI), began in the United States House of Representatives as a bill raising certain tariffs on goods entering the United States. The high rates angered Republican &quot;progressive&quot; faction, and led to a deep split in the Republican Party.

==History==

Protectionism was the ideological cement holding the Republican coalition together. High tariffs were used by Republicans to promise higher sales to business, higher wages to industrial workers, and higher demand for farm products. Progressive insurgents said it promoted monopoly. Democrats said it was a tax on the little man. It had greatest support in the Northeast, and greatest opposition in the South and West. The Midwest was the battle ground. 

One provision of the Payne Aldrich law provided for the creation of a tariff board to study the problem of tariff modification in full and to collect information on the subject for the use of Congress and the President in future tariff considerations. Another provision allowed for free trade with the Philippines, then under American control. Congress passed the bill officially on April 9, 1909. The bill states it would &quot;take effect the day following its passage.&quot; President Taft officially signed the bill at 5:05 pm on August 5, 1909.

The Democrats took control of the House in the 1910 election. President Taft was challenged for reelection in 1912 by former president Theodore Roosevelt for the 1912 Republican nomination. Taft prevailed and Roosevelt and his &quot;progressive&quot; faction formed a new third party. The result was a Democratic landslide making Woodrow Wilson president. The Democrats sharply lowered the tariff in 1913. 

==Impact==
The Payne Act had the immediate effect of frustrating proponents of reducing tariffs. In particular, the bill greatly angered Progressives, who began to withdraw support from President Taft. Because it increased the duty on print paper used by publishers, the publishing industry viciously criticized the President, further tarnishing his image. Although Taft met and consulted with Congress during its deliberations on the bill, critics charged that he ought to have imposed more of his own recommendations on the bill such as that of a slower schedule. However, unlike his predecessor (Theodore Roosevelt), Taft felt that the president should not dictate lawmaking and should leave Congress free to act as it saw fit. Taft signed the bill with enthusiasm on 5 August 1909, expecting it would stimulate the economy and enhance his political standing. He especially praised the provision empowering the president to raise rates on countries which discriminated against American products, and the provision for free trade with the Philippines.

In an article for the &quot;Quarterly Journal of Economics&quot;, F. W. Taussig wrote that the congressional debates about the tariffs were &quot;depressing for the economist. There is hardly a gleam of general reasoning of the sort which is applied in our books to questions of international trade... That there should be general acceptance of the protectionist principle, and that the only question in debate should be whether duties were &quot;unreasonably&quot; high, was natural enough. Most people get used to existing conditions, and cannot easily conceive of anything different.&quot;

The defection of insurgent Republicans from the Midwest began Taft&#x27;s slippage of support. It heralded conflicts over conservation, patronage, and progressive legislation. The debate over the tariff thus split the Republican Party into Progressives and Old Guards and led the split party to lose the 1910 congressional election.

===Corporate Income Tax===
The bill also enacted a small income tax on the privilege of conducting business as a corporation, which was affirmed in the Supreme Court decision &quot;Flint v. Stone Tracy Co.&quot; (also known as the Corporation Tax case).

<text>Clear and Present Danger is a political thriller novel, written by Tom Clancy and published on August 17, 1989. A sequel to &quot;The Cardinal of the Kremlin&quot; (1988), main character Jack Ryan becomes acting Deputy Director of Intelligence in the Central Intelligence Agency, and discovers that he is being kept in the dark by his colleagues who are conducting a covert war against a drug cartel based in Colombia. It debuted at number one on &quot;The New York Times&quot; bestseller list. A film adaptation, featuring Harrison Ford reprising his role as Ryan, was released on August 3, 1994.

==Plot summary==
The President of the United States is running for reelection. His fierce opponent in Ohio, Governor J. Robert Fowler, has rallied the American public behind the current administration&#x27;s failures in the War on Drugs. National Security Advisor James Cutter seizes an opportunity to help the president initiate covert operations within Colombia with the intent to disrupt the illegal drug trade there. Aided by CIA Deputy Director (Operations) Robert Ritter and CIA director Arthur Moore, the plan involves inserting light infantry troops of Hispanic descent (divided into four 11 man teams, codenamed BANNER, KNIFE, OMEN and FEATURE) into the country to stake out airstrips used by the cartel (SHOWBOAT), which then allows F-15 Eagles to intercept drug flights (EAGLE EYE). In addition, mobile phone communications between cartel management are intercepted through CAPER, which is also the communications arm for SHOWBOAT.

Meanwhile, a United States Coast Guard Cutter intercepts a yacht in the Caribbean Sea; two Hispanic men are found cleaning the vessel after murdering its owner and his family. When a senior crewman says the murderers could escape justice by claiming they found the ship after the murders took place, the Coast Guard captain orders a mock trial and execution, and the killers are forced to confess their crimes; it is later learned that the murdered owner was a businessman involved in a money laundering scheme for a Colombian drug cartel. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) seizes laundered money and other assets from several U.S. and European banks totaling over $650 million. 

The seizure of the cartel money by the FBI infuriates drug cartel leader Ernesto Escobedo, who ordered the hit on the American businessman. Meanwhile, his intelligence officer, Felix Cortez, starts dating the secretary of FBI director Emil Jacobs and finds out about Jacobs&#x27;s official visit to the Attorney General of Colombia. Escobedo orders the assassination of Jacobs without informing Cortez. Upon arriving in the city of Bogotá, the FBI director&#x27;s motorcade is ambushed, killing him as well as the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration and the U.S. ambassador to Colombia. Enraged, the President authorizes Operation RECIPROCITY, stepping up Cutter&#x27;s operations and declaring war on Escobedo&#x27;s drug organization.

Later, a surgical airstrike on a drug kingpin&#x27;s mansion during a meeting of several cartel members kills everyone inside. Escobedo did not attend the meeting and sent Cortez to represent him; Cortez was delayed and witnessed the explosion as a result. Cortez later deduces that the Americans have been conducting operations against the Colombian drug cartel, but plays along, planning to engineer a war within the cartel that will leave him in a position to seize power. He dispatches cartel men to hunt down the American troops, and later blackmails Cutter in a secret meeting into shutting down all covert operations against the cartel in exchange for reducing drug exports to the United States. The point man for team BANNER, not paying attention due to suffering from food poisoning, accidentally blunders the team into an encampment of cartel men, which results in a firefight that kills half of them, with the survivors later meeting up with team KNIFE. 

Meanwhile, Jack Ryan, former Marine and acting CIA Deputy Director (Intelligence) after his boss, Admiral James Greer, was hospitalized for pancreatic cancer, suspects the Agency&#x27;s involvement in the situation in Colombia. His position enables him to be aware of most operations, but he realizes he is being kept out of the loop on what is happening in South America. After his friend, fighter pilot Robby Jackson, makes an inquiry into activity in the region, Ryan becomes determined to find out what is going on. He learns about the covert operations by breaking into Ritter&#x27;s files. Outraged, he seeks help from the FBI and later meets John Clark, a CIA field operative and former Navy SEAL coordinating CAPER. The cartel men surround and attack team KNIFE and the survivors of BANNER, killing most of them, leaving just Staff Sergeant Domingo &quot;Ding&quot; Chavez and a few other escaping survivors, while suffering heavy casualties of their own. 

Having been previously ordered by the President to shut down all covert operations against the cartel to avoid the political fallout, Cutter does so after his secret meeting with Cortez. He secretly provides Cortez with the coordinates of the American troops in Colombia for him to hunt down. Their meeting having been shadowed by the FBI, Ryan and Clark are outraged. They team up to rescue American troops left behind in Colombia, using a U.S. Air Force special operations helicopter. This results in their missing Greer&#x27;s funeral, which raises the suspicions of Moore and Ritter. Although the rescue team suffers casualties from the cartel men hunting the American soldiers in Colombia, they successfully extract the survivors, including Chavez. Later, the team captures Cortez and Escobedo in a raid on the cartel&#x27;s command post. They then fly out to sea, where they safely land on the cutter &quot;Panache&quot;. 

After being confronted by Clark with evidence of his treason, Cutter commits suicide by jumping in front of a bus. Ryan confronts a defiant President for not informing him about the covert operations in Colombia and nearly starting a war. After he briefs the heads of the Special Intelligence Committee, the President deliberately throws the election to Fowler in order to hide the operations and protect the honor of those involved. 

Escobedo is turned over to his fellow cartel chieftains, who will surely execute him. Cortez is later returned to Cuba, where he has been branded as a traitor by his former DGI colleagues. Meanwhile, Clark takes Chavez under his wing and recruits him into the CIA.

==Themes==
&quot;Clear and Present Danger&quot; discusses the abuse of political and military power, and addresses the dangers of a government bureaucracy where no one can be held accountable for actions implied to be illegal by a democratic society. The book was released around the time of the Iran-Contra affair, which strikingly bears many parallels with the novel. Additionally, it pushes the narrative that the War on Drugs, which was also a major issue during the time of the book&#x27;s publication, is corrupting law enforcement, and that the status quo is enforced in this struggle.

==Reception==
===Commercial===
The book debuted at number one on the New York Times bestseller list, and stayed on the chart for several years as well as its paperback edition. It became the best-selling novel of the 1980s, selling 1,625,544 hardcover copies.

===Critical===
The book received wide critical acclaim. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; praised it as a “rousing adventure” and “a crackling good yarn”. &quot;The New York Times&quot; remarked in its review: “The issues raised are real ones, and a jump ahead of the headlines.” Publishers Weekly hailed it as Clancy&#x27;s best work since &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot;.
=== Year-end lists ===
* 5th – David Stupich, &quot;The Milwaukee Journal&quot;

==Film adaptation==

The book was adapted as a feature film, which was released on August 3, 1994. Harrison Ford reprised his role from the previous movie &quot;Patriot Games&quot; (1992) as Ryan, while Willem Dafoe played Clark. The film received positive reviews, with Rotten Tomatoes giving it a rating of 80% based on 40 reviews. It was a major financial success, earning over $200 million at the box office.

As in the previous film &quot;Patriot Games&quot;, Clancy was less than pleased with the movie due to script changes. He favored John Milius’s initial script, which was written before &quot;Patriot Games&quot; started production and closer to the book. However, when Donald Stewart was hired by Paramount Pictures to rewrite the script due to Ryan not being the central character, Clancy lambasted the new screenplay as “really awful” and criticized its technical inaccuracies. “First things first,” Clancy continued, “&quot;Clear and Present Danger&quot; was the No. 1 best-selling novel of the 1980s. One might conclude that the novel’s basic story line had some quality to it. Why, then, has nearly every aspect of the book been tossed away?” Regarding the different ending, in which Ryan testified before Congress about the covert operations instead of privately confronting the President, Ford said: ”We have softened somewhat the political bias [Clancy] brings to the subject, not because we’re bleeding-heart liberals, but because we wanted to divest it of some of its baggage and let it walk on its own two legs.”

In a 2018 interview with &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, &quot;Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan&quot; creators Carlton Cuse and Graham Roland revealed that they originally opted to adapt &quot;Clear and Present Danger&quot; for television. Roland then explained: “About a month into it, we realized the reason the Clancy books worked so well was because they were relevant for the time that they were written. So we had to take the spirit of what he did and create our own original story.”

<doc id="55738" wikidata="Q5440221" url="?curid=55738" title="Federal Farm Loan Act">
<text>The Federal Farm Loan Act of 1916 () was a United States federal law aimed at increasing credit to rural family farmers. It did so by creating a federal farm loan board, twelve regional farm loan banks and tens of farm loan associations. The act was signed into law by President Woodrow Wilson.

==Background==

In 1908, the Administration of Theodore Roosevelt commissioned a study on the problems facing rural families. At this point in U.S. history, these families made up the largest demographic of Americans. The commission concluded that access to credit was one of the most serious problems facing rural farmers and recommended the introduction of a cooperative credit system.

Four years later, Presidents William Howard Taft and Woodrow Wilson sent a commission of Americans to study cooperative credit systems for farmers in Europe. Components of such European programs at the time included cooperative land-mortgage banks and rural credit unions. This commission concluded that the best form of cooperative credit system would include both long-term credit to cover land mortgages and short-term credit to cover regular business needs.
==Effect on the rural farmer==
The most visible component of the Act were the loans to individual farmers and their families. Under the act, farmers could borrow up to 50% of the value of their land and 20% of the value of their improvements. The minimum loan was $100 and the maximum was $10,000. Loans made through the Act were paid off through amortization over 5 to 40 years.

Borrowers also purchased shares of the National Farm Loan Association. This meant that it served as a cooperative agency that lent money from farmer to farmer. This was heavily influenced by a successful cooperative credit system in Germany called Landschaft.

The next most visible component of the Act were the mortgage-backed bonds that were issued. The rate of interest on the mortgages could be no more than 1 percent higher than the rate of interest on the bonds. This spread covered the issuers&#x27; administrative costs, but did not lead to a significant profit. In addition, the maximum rate of interest on the bonds was 6 percent, ensuring that borrowing costs for farmers was often much lower than before the Act was passed.

The act furthered Wilson&#x27;s reputation against trusts and big business. By providing small farmers with competitive loans, they were now more able to compete with big business. As a result, the likelihood of agricultural monopolies decreased.

While Wilson&#x27;s commission suggested that short-term credit also be incorporated in any nationalized credit system, the Act lacked this crucial component. Due to increased competition and the need for agriculture machinery, a system for short-term credit was incorporated into the current system in Agricultural Credits Act of 1923.

Sponsored by Senator Henry F. Hollis (D) of New Hampshire and Representative Asbury F. Lever (D) of South Carolina, it was a reintroduced version of the Hollis-Bulkley Act of 1914 that had not passed Congress due to Wilson&#x27;s opposition.

==Structure of implementation==
The Act established the Federal Farm Loan Board to oversee and supervise federal land banks and national farm loan associations. It was also responsible for setting benchmark rates of interest for mortgages and bonds. Finally, it could intervene when it thought specific banks were making irresponsible loans.

The twelve Federal Land Banks were required to hold at least $750,000 in capital. Stock ownership of the banks were held by national farm loan associations and other interested investors, including any individual, corporation or fund. In the case of insufficient capital, the U.S. Treasury (through the Federal Farm Loan Board) made up the difference. When additional subscriptions were made from other sources, federal ownership in the banks was retired.

National Farm Loan Associations were established groups of 10 or more mortgage-holding farmers who together owned 5% or more of a federal land bank. Once formed, they were subject to a charter review process by the Federal Farm Loan Board. This structure aimed to align the incentives of individual farmers with the banks, as farmers held two roles: borrowers and lenders.

==Subsequent history==
Under the administration of Herbert Hoover, the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1929 established the Federal Farm Board from the Federal Farm Loan Board established by the Federal Farm Loan Act with a revolving fund of half a billion dollars.

<text>The Railway Labor Act is a United States federal law that governs labor relations in the railroad and airline industries. The Act, enacted in 1926 and amended in 1934 and 1936, seeks to substitute bargaining, arbitration, and mediation for strikes to resolve labor disputes. Its provisions were originally enforced under the Board of Mediation, but they were later enforced under a National Mediation Board.

==Earlier laws==
In 1877, protests broke out in Martinsburg, West Virginia when the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&amp;O) cut worker pay for the third time in a year. West Virginia Governor Henry M. Mathews sent militia under Colonel Charles J. Faulkner to restore order but was unsuccessful largely because of militia sympathies with the workers. The governor reluctantly called for federal assistance, which restored peace to Martinsburg but proved to be controversial, with many newspapers critical of the governor&#x27;s characterization of the strikes as an &quot;insurrection&quot;, rather than an act of desperation. One notable paper recorded a striking worker&#x27;s perspective that he &quot;had might as well die by the bullet as to starve to death by inches.&quot; A day after federal troops had restored order in Martinsburg, similar protests erupted in Maryland and spread to New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois, and Missouri. The strikes, which lasted six weeks, would come to be known as the Great Railroad Strike of 1877.

Congress later passed the Arbitration Act of 1888, which authorized the creation of arbitration panels with the power to investigate the causes of labor disputes and to issue non-binding arbitration awards. The Act was a complete failure since only one panel was ever convened under the Act: in the case of the 1894 Pullman Strike, it issued its report only after the strike had been ended by a federal court injunction, backed by federal troops.

Congress attempted to correct the shortcomings in the Erdman Act, enacted in 1898. The Erdman Act likewise provided for voluntary arbitration but made any award issued by the panel binding and enforceable in federal court. It also outlawed discrimination against employees for union activities, prohibited &quot;yellow dog contracts&quot; (in which an employee agreed not to join a union during employment), and required both sides to maintain the status quo during any arbitration proceedings and for three months after an award was issued. The arbitration procedures were rarely used. A successor statute, the Newlands Labor Act of 1913, which created the Board of Mediation, proved to be more effective. It was largely superseded when the federal government nationalized the railroads in 1917, after the US entered World War I. (See United States Railroad Administration.)

The Adamson Act, enacted in 1916, provided workers with an eight-hour day at the same daily wage they had received previously for a ten-hour day, and it required time-and-a-half pay for overtime work. Another law enacted that year, amid increasing concerns about the war in Europe, gave US President Woodrow Wilson the power to &quot;take possession of and assume control of any system of transportation&quot; for transportation of troops and war material.

Wilson exercised that authority on December 26, 1917. While Congress considered nationalizing the railroads on a permanent basis after the war, the Wilson administration announced that it was returning the railroad system to its owners. However, Congress tried to preserve, the most successful features of the federal wartime administration, which were the adjustment boards, by creating a Railroad Labor Board (RLB) with the power to issue nonbinding proposals for the resolution of labor disputes, as part of the Esch–Cummins Act (Transportation Act of 1920).

The RLB soon destroyed whatever moral authority its decisions might have had in a series of decisions. In 1921, it ordered a twelve percent reduction in employees&#x27; wages, which the railroads were quick to implement. The following year, when shop employees of the railroads launched a national strike, the RLB issued a declaration that purported to outlaw the strike, and the US Department of Justice obtained an injunction that carried out that declaration. From then on, railway unions refused to have anything to do with the RLB.

==Passage and amendment==
The RLA was the product of negotiations between the major railroad companies and the unions that represented their employees. Like its predecessors, it relied on boards of adjustment, established by the parties, to resolve labor disputes, with a government-appointed Board of Mediation to attempt to resolve those disputes that board of adjustment could not. The RLA promoted voluntary arbitration as the best method for resolving those disputes that the Board of Mediation could not settle.

Congress strengthened the procedures in the 1934 amendments to the Act, which created a procedure for resolving whether a union had the support of the majority of employees in a particular &quot;craft or class&quot;, while turning the Board of Mediation into a permanent agency, the National Mediation Board (NMB), with broader powers.

Congress extended the RLA to cover airline employees in 1936.

==Bargaining and strikes==
Unlike the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), which adopts a less interventionist approach to the way the parties conduct collective bargaining or resolve their disputes arising under collective bargaining agreements, the RLA specifies both (1) the negotiation and mediation procedures that unions and employers must exhaust before they may change the status quo and (2) the methods for resolving &quot;minor&quot; disputes over the interpretation or application of collective bargaining agreements.

The RLA permits strikes over major disputes only after the union has exhausted the RLA&#x27;s negotiation and mediation procedures and bars almost all strikes over minor disputes. The RLA also authorizes the courts to enjoin strikes if the union has not exhausted those procedures.

On the other hand, the RLA imposes fewer restrictions on the tactics that unions may use when they do have the right to strike. The RLA, unlike the NLRA, allows secondary boycotts against other RLA-regulated carriers and permits employees to engage in other types of strikes, such as intermittent strikes, that might be unprotected under the NLRA.

===&quot;Major&quot; and &quot;minor&quot; disputes===
The RLA categorizes all labor disputes as either &quot;major&quot; disputes, which concern the making or modification of the collective bargaining agreement between the parties, or &quot;minor&quot; disputes, which involve the interpretation or application of collective bargaining agreements. Unions can strike over major disputes only after they have exhausted the RLA&#x27;s &quot;almost interminable&quot; negotiation and mediation procedures. They cannot, on the other hand, strike over minor disputes, either during the arbitration procedures or after an award is issued.

The federal courts have the power to enjoin a strike over a major dispute if the union has not exhausted the RLA&#x27;s negotiation and mediation procedures. The Norris-LaGuardia Act dictates the procedures that the court must follow. Once the NMB releases the parties from mediation, however, they retain the power to engage in strikes or lockouts, even if they subsequently resume negotiations or the NMB offers mediation again.

The federal courts likewise have the power to enjoin a union from striking over arbitrable disputes, that is minor disputes. The court may, on the other hand, also require the employer to restore the status quo as a condition of any injunctive relief against a strike.

Major dispute bargaining is handled through the &quot;Section 6&quot; process, named for the section of the Act that describes the bargaining process. The railroad carriers have formed a coalition for national handling of Railway Labor Act bargaining under Section 6, named the National Carriers Conference Committee (NCCC). The railroad unions also form coalitions of various unions to increase bargaining power in the Section 6 process.

===Discipline and replacement of strikers===
Carriers may lawfully replace strikers engaged in a lawful strike but may not, however, discharge them except for misconduct or eliminate their jobs to retaliate against them for striking. It is not clear whether the employer can discharge workers for striking before all of the RLA&#x27;s bargaining and mediation processes have been exhausted.

The employer must also allow strikers to replace replacements hired on a temporary basis and permanent replacements who have not completed the training required before they can become active employees. The employer may, on the other hand, allow less senior employees who crossed the picket line to keep the jobs they were given after crossing the line, even if the seniority rules in effect before the strike would have required the employer to reassign their jobs to returning strikers.

==Representation elections==
The NMB has the responsibility for conducting elections when a union claims to represent a carrier&#x27;s employees. The NMB defines the craft or class of employees eligible to vote, which almost always extends to all of the employees performing a particular job function throughout the company&#x27;s operations, rather than just those at a particular site or in a particular region.

A union seeking to represent an unorganized group of employees must produce signed and dated authorization cards or other proof of support from at least 50% of the craft or class. A party attempting to oust an incumbent union must produce evidence of support from a majority of the craft or class and then the NMB must conduct an election. If the employees are unrepresented and the employer agrees, the NMB may certify the union based on the authorization cards alone.

The NMB usually uses mail ballots to conduct elections, unlike the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), which has historically preferred walk-in elections under the NLRA. The NMB can order a rerun election if it determines that either an employer or union has interfered with employees&#x27; free choice.

==Protecting employees&#x27; rights==
Unlike the NLRA, which gives the NLRB nearly exclusive power to enforce the Act, the RLA allows employees to sue in federal court to challenge an employer&#x27;s violation of the Act. The courts can grant employees reinstatement and backpay, along with other forms of equitable relief.

==Constitutionality==
At least one court has ruled that imposition of railroad contract terms does not violate the Constitution&#x27;s prohibition in Article I, Section 9 against bills of attainder, because they are not a punishment for specific people.

<doc id="55740" wikidata="Q972653" url="?curid=55740" title="Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914">
<text>The Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914 (, codified at , ), is a part of United States antitrust law with the goal of adding further substance to the U.S. antitrust law regime; the Clayton Act seeks to prevent anticompetitive practices in their . 

That regime started with the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, the first Federal law outlawing practices that were harmful to consumers (monopolies, cartels, and trusts). The Clayton Act specified particular prohibited conduct, the three-level enforcement scheme, the exemptions, and the remedial measures. Like the Sherman Act, much of the substance of the Clayton Act has been developed and animated by the U.S. courts, particularly the Supreme Court.

==Background==

Since the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, courts in the United States had interpreted the law on cartels as applying against trade unions. This had created a problem for workers, who needed to organize to balance the equal bargaining power against their employers. The Sherman Act had also triggered the largest wave of mergers in US history, as businesses realized that instead of creating a cartel they could simply fuse into a single corporation, and have all the benefits of market power that a cartel could bring. At the end of the Taft administration, and the start of the Woodrow Wilson administration, a Commission on Industrial Relations was established. During its proceedings, and in anticipation of its first report on October 23, 1914, legislation was introduced by Alabama Democrat Henry De Lamar Clayton Jr. in the U.S. House of Representatives. The Clayton Act passed by a vote of 277 to 54 on June 5, 1914. Though the Senate passed its own version on September 2, 1914, by a vote of 46–16, the final version of the law (written after deliberation between Senate and the House), did not pass the Senate until October 6 and the House until October 8 of 1914.

==Contents==
The Clayton Act made both substantive and procedural modifications to federal antitrust law. Substantively, the act seeks to capture anticompetitive practices in their incipiency by prohibiting particular types of conduct not deemed in the best interest of a competitive market. There are 4 sections of the bill that proposed substantive changes in the antitrust laws by way of supplementing the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890. In those sections, the Act thoroughly discusses the following four principles of economic trade and business:

* price discrimination between different purchasers if such a discrimination substantially lessens competition or tends to create a monopoly in any line of commerce (Act Section 2, codified at );
* sales on the condition that (A) the buyer or lessee not deal with the competitors of the seller or lessor (&quot;exclusive dealings&quot;) or (B) the buyer also purchase another different product (&quot;tying&quot;) but only when these acts substantially lessen competition (Act Section 3, codified at );
* mergers and acquisitions where the effect may substantially lessen competition (Act Section 7, codified at ) or where the voting securities and assets threshold is met (Act Section 7a, codified at );
* any person from being a director of two or more competing corporations, if those corporations would violate the antitrust criteria by merging (Act Section 8; codified 1200 at ).

===Comparisons to other acts===

Unilateral price discrimination is clearly outside the reach of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, which only extended to &quot;concerted activities&quot; (agreements). Exclusive dealing, tying, and mergers are all agreements, and theoretically, within the reach of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. Likewise, mergers that create monopolies would be actionable under Sherman Act Section 2.

Section 7 of the Clayton Act allows greater regulation of mergers than just Sherman Act Section 2, since it does not require a merger-to-monopoly before there is a violation. It allows the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice to regulate all mergers, and gives the government discretion whether to give approval to a merger or not, which it still commonly does today. The government often employs the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) test for market concentration to determine whether the merger is presumptively anticompetitive; if the HHI level for a particular merger exceeds a certain level, the government will investigate further to determine its probable competitive impact.

===Section 7===
Section 7 elaborates on specific and crucial concepts of the Clayton Act; &quot;holding company&quot; defined as &quot;a company whose primary purpose is to hold stocks of other companies&quot;, which the government saw as a &quot;common and favorite method of promoting monopoly&quot; and a mere corporated form of the &#x27;old fashioned&#x27; trust. Section 7 prohibits acquisitions where the effect may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly.

Another important factor to consider is the amendment passed in Congress on Section 7 of the Clayton Act in 1950. This original position of the US government on mergers and acquisitions was strengthened by the Celler-Kefauver amendments of 1950, so as to cover asset as well as stock acquisitions.

===Pre-merger notification===
Section 7a, , requires that companies notify the Federal Trade Commission and the Assistant Attorney General of the United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division of any contemplated mergers and acquisitions that meet or exceed certain thresholds. Pursuant to the Hart–Scott–Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, section 7A(a)(2) requires the Federal Trade Commission to revise those thresholds annually, based on the change in gross national product, in accordance with Section 8(a)(5) and take effect 30 days after publication in the Federal Register. (For example, see and .)

===Section 8===
Section 8 of the Act refers to the prohibition of one person of serving as director of two or more corporations if the certain threshold values are met, which are required to be set by regulation of the Federal Trade Commission, revised annually based on the change in gross national product, pursuant to the Hart–Scott–Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act. (For example, see .)

===Other===
Because the act singles out exclusive dealing and tying arrangements, one may assume they would be subject to heightened scrutiny, perhaps they would even be illegal &quot;per se&quot;. That remains true for tying, under the authority of &quot;Jefferson Parish Hospital District No. 2 v. Hyde&quot;. However, when exclusive dealings are challenged under Clayton-3 (or Sherman-1), they are treated under the rule of reason. Under the &#x27;rule of reason&#x27;, the conduct is only illegal, and the plaintiff can only prevail, upon proving to the court that the defendants are doing substantial economic harm.

==Exemptions==
An important difference between the Clayton Act and its predecessor, the Sherman Act, is that the Clayton Act contained safe harbors for union activities. Section 6 of the Act (codified at ) exempts labor unions and agricultural organizations, saying &quot;that the labor of a human being is not a commodity or article of commerce, and permit[ting] labor organizations to carry out their legitimate objective&quot;. Therefore, boycotts, peaceful strikes, peaceful picketing, and collective bargaining are not regulated by this statute. Injunctions could be used to settle labor disputes only when property damage was threatened. The AFL strongly supported Section 6 of the Act, with AFL head Samuel Gompers describing the law as &quot;Labor&#x27;s Magna Charta&quot; or &quot;Bill of Rights.&quot;

The Supreme Court ruled in the 1922 case &quot;Federal Baseball Club v. National League&quot; that Major League Baseball was not &quot;interstate commerce&quot; and thus was not subject to federal antitrust law.

==Enforcement==
Procedurally, the Act empowers private parties injured by violations of the Act to sue for treble damages under Section 4 and injunctive relief under Section 16. The Supreme Court has held that divestiture is a form of &quot;injunctive relief&quot; authorized by Section 16.

Under the Clayton Act, only civil suits could be brought to the court&#x27;s attention and a provision &quot;permits a suit in the federal courts for three times the actual damages caused by anything forbidden in the antitrust laws&quot;, including court costs and attorney&#x27;s fees.

The Act is enforced by the Federal Trade Commission, which was also created and empowered during the Wilson Presidency by the Federal Trade Commission Act, and also the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice.

<text>The Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914 is a United States federal law which established the Federal Trade Commission. The Act was signed into law by US President Woodrow Wilson in 1914 and outlaws unfair methods of competition and unfair acts or practices that affect commerce.

== Background ==
The inspiration and motivation for this act started in 1890, when the Sherman Antitrust Act was passed. There was a strong antitrust movement to prevent manufacturers from joining price-fixing cartels. After &quot;Northern Securities Co. v. United States&quot;, a 1904 case that dismantled a J. P. Morgan company, antitrust enforcement became institutionalized. Soon, US President Theodore Roosevelt created the Bureau of Corporations, an agency that reported on the economy and businesses in the industry. The agency was the predecessor to the Federal Trade Commission.

In 1913, Congress expanded on the agency by passing the Federal Trade Commissions Act and the Clayton Antitrust Act. The Federal Trade Commission Act was designed for business reform. Congress passed the act in the hopes of protecting consumers against methods of deception in advertisement and of forcing the business to be upfront and truthful about items being sold.

The act was part of a bigger movement in the early 20th century to use special groups like commissions to regulate and oversee certain forms of business. The Federal Trade Commission Act works in conjunction with the Sherman Act and the Clayton Act. Any violations of the Sherman Act also violates the Federal Trade Commission Act and so the Federal Trade Commission can act on cases that violate either act. The Federal Trade Commission Act and both antitrust laws were created for the sole objective to &quot;protect the process of competition for the benefit of consumers, making sure there are strong incentives for businesses to operate efficiently, keep prices down, and keep quality up.&quot; The acts are considered the core of antitrust laws and are still very important in today&#x27;s society.

This commission was authorized to issue &quot;cease and desist&quot; orders to large corporations to curb unfair trade practices. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission Act is also considered a measure that protects privacy since it allows the FTC to penalize companies that violate their own policies by false advertising and other actions that can harm consumers. Some of the unfair methods of competition that were targeted include deceptive advertisements and pricing.

The act passed the Senate by a 43-5 vote on September 8, 1914 and the House on September 10 without a tally of yeas and nays. It was signed into law by President Wilson on September 26.

==Summary==
The Federal Trade Commission Act does more than create the Commission:

Under this Act, the Commission is empowered, among other things, to (a) prevent unfair methods of competition, and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce; (b) seek monetary redress and other relief for conduct injurious to consumers; (c) prescribe trade regulation rules defining with specificity acts or practices that are unfair or deceptive, and establishing requirements designed to prevent such acts or practices; (d) conduct investigations relating to the organization, business, practices, and management of entities engaged in commerce; and (e) make reports and legislative recommendations to Congress.

The FTC Act prohibits unfair methods of competition, unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce. The Commission is empowered to enforce the act&#x27;s provisions against all persons, partnerships or corporations, with several exceptions, including banks, savings and loans institutions, federal credit unions—each as described in the FTC Act. Banks, savings and loans institutions, federal credit unions and certain other financial entities are instead under the jurisdiction of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. 

The Commission enforces the FTC Act through its federal rulemaking authority to issue industry-wide rules and regulations, adjudicatory powers, and statutory authority to file civil actions in certain circumstances. The FTC Act does not give consumers the right to sue for violations of the act, but consumers may complain to the Commission about acts or practices they believe to be unfair or deceptive. Consumers may, however, be authorized to sue under a state &quot;UDAP&quot; (unfair, deceptive and abusive practices) statute, sometimes called a &quot;Little FTC Act.&quot; 

=== Deception ===
An act or practice is &quot;deceptive&quot; under the FTC Act when there is a representation, omission or practice that is likely to mislead a consumer acting reasonably in the circumstances. The representation, omission or practice must also be material, in that it is likely to affect the consumer&#x27;s conduct or decision regarding the product or service. If the representation or practice is directed to a particular group, the Commission will consider reasonableness from that targeted group&#x27;s perspective. Notably, there is no requirement that the actor intend for their acts to be misleading.

=== Unfairness ===
An act or practice is &quot;unfair&quot; under the FTC Act if it &quot;causes or is likely to cause substantial injury&quot; to consumers when the injury is &quot;not reasonably avoidable by consumers themselves.&quot; Further, for an act or practice to be unfair, the injury cannot be outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or competition. An example of an injury that rises to the level of &quot;substantial&quot; for unfairness purposes would be the coercion of consumers into purchasing defective goods or services on credit without the ability to assert creditor claims or defenses against the transaction. Although public policy is not a specific criterion, it may be considered in determining how substantial an injury might be.

== Enforcement ==
=== Administrative adjudication ===
If after investigating, the Commission has reason to believe an actor has violated the FTC Act&#x27;s prohibition on unfair methods of competition or unfair or deceptive acts or practices, and that a proceeding against the actor is in the public&#x27;s best interest, the Commission is authorized to commence administrative proceedings against the actor in administrative court. Other parties may apply to intervene and appear at the hearing. If, after the administrative hearing, the Commission determines the actor has violated the FTC Act&#x27;s prohibitions on unfair and deceptive acts, it must provide the actor with findings of fact and issue and serve a cease and desist order against the violation. The enjoined party may appeal the FTC&#x27;s cease and desist order to the U.S. Court of Appeals in &quot;any circuit where the method of competition or act or practice in question was used or where such person, partnership or corporation resides or carries on business . . . .&quot;

=== Civil actions against parties subject to administrative cease and desist order ===
When a cease and desist order against a person&#x27;s act or practice of unfair and deceptive practices becomes final, the Commission may then seek relief for the violation in either a U.S. district court or &quot;in any competent jurisdiction of a State.&quot; If the court determines that the act or practice in question is &quot;one in which a reasonable man would have known under the circumstances was dishonest or fraudulent,&quot; the court may grant relief that the &quot;court finds necessary to redress injury to consumers or other persons, partnerships, and corporations&quot; resulting from the violation or unfair or deceptive act or practice. The statute provides a non-exhaustive list of relief available, including rescission or reformation of contracts, refunds or returns of property, damages, or public notice of the violation.

In addition, if an actor subject to a cease and desist order violates the Commission&#x27;s final and in-effect order to cease and desist engaging in an unfair or deceptive act or practice, the enjoined actor is automatically liable for a civil penalty up to $10,000 per violation, the amount of which is to be determined by a district court. In such circumstances, the FTC Act gives U.S. district courts the power to grant mandatory injunctions and &quot;such other and further equitable relief as they deem appropriate&quot; in order to enforce the Commission&#x27;s final order.

=== Other civil actions ===
The Commission is also authorized to commence civil actions in a U.S. district court—without first adjudicating the matter in administrative court—against actors it finds to be in violation of the Commission&#x27;s promulgated rules prohibiting deceptive and unfair practices. It may do so, however, only in certain circumstances, including if it determines that the actor had actual knowledge or &quot;knowledge fairly implied on the basis of objective circumstances&quot; that the act is unfair or deceptive.

If the Commission issued a final and in-effect cease and desist order through its administrative proceedings with regard to an unlawful act or practice, it may initiate civil proceedings against another actor for engaging in the same unlawful act or practice, even when the new actor was not subject to the initial cease and desist order. However, the Commission may do so only if the actor had engaged in the act or practice with &quot;actual knowledge&quot; that the act or practice was both &quot;unfair or deceptive&quot; and unlawful.

Actual knowledge can be established with a showing that the Commission provided the actor with a copy of its determination or a synopsis of such determination that led to the relevant cease and desist order. Both types of actions will result in an up to $10,000 civil penalty to be determined by the court.

The FTC Act also authorizes the Commission in particular cases to obtain a permanent injunction through a civil action in federal court against any actor under the Commission&#x27;s jurisdiction if it believes the actor &quot;is violating, or is about to violate, any provision of law&quot; enforced by the Commission. The U.S. Supreme Court has determined that the provision providing the Commission with its power to seek a permanent injunction does not give it the extra power to seek an award of &quot;equitable monetary relief such as restitution or disgorgement.&quot;

<text>The Federal Reserve Act was passed by the 63rd United States Congress and signed into law by President Woodrow Wilson on December 23, 1913. The law created the Federal Reserve System, the central banking system of the United States.

After Democrats won unified control of Congress and the presidency in the 1912 elections, President Wilson, Congressman Carter Glass, and Senator Robert Latham Owen crafted a central banking bill that occupied a middle ground between the Aldrich Plan, which called for private control of the central banking system, and progressives like William Jennings Bryan, who favored government control over the central banking system. Wilson made the bill a top priority of his New Freedom domestic agenda, and he helped ensure that it passed both houses of Congress without major amendments.

The Federal Reserve Act created the Federal Reserve System, consisting of twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks jointly responsible for managing the country&#x27;s money supply, making loans and providing oversight to banks, and serving as a lender of last resort. To lead the Federal Reserve System, the act established the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, members of which are appointed by the president. The 1933 Banking Act amended the Federal Reserve Act to create the Federal Open Market Committee, which oversees the Federal Reserve&#x27;s open market operations. A later amendment requires the Federal Reserve &quot;to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.&quot;

== Overview ==
The Federal Reserve Act created a system of private and public entities. There were to be at least eight and no more than twelve private regional Federal Reserve banks. Twelve were established, and each had various branches, a board of directors, and district boundaries. The Federal Reserve Board, consisting of seven members, was created as the governing body of the Fed. Each member is appointed by the U.S. president and confirmed by the U.S. Senate. In 1935, the Board was renamed and restructured. Also created as part of the Federal Reserve System was a 12-member Federal Advisory Committee and a single new United States currency, the Federal Reserve Note. The Federal Reserve Act created a national currency and a monetary system that could respond effectively to the stresses in the banking system and create a stable financial system. The goal of the system was to ensure that there would always be a supply of money and credit in times of financial strain. With the goal of creating a national monetary system and financial stability, the Federal Reserve Act also provided many other functions and financial services for the economy, such as check clearing and collection for all members of the Federal Reserve.

With the passing of the Federal Reserve Act, Congress required that all nationally chartered banks become members of the Federal Reserve System. These banks were required to purchase specified non-transferable stock in their regional Federal Reserve banks, and to set aside a stipulated amount of non-interest bearing reserves with their respective reserve banks. Since 1980, all depository institutions have been required to set aside reserves with the Federal Reserve. Such institutions are entitled to certain Federal Reserve services. State chartered banks were given the option of becoming members of the Federal Reserve System and in the case of the exercise of such option were to be subject to supervision, in part, by the Federal Reserve System. Member banks became entitled to have access to discounted loans at the discount window in their respective reserve banks, to a 6% annual dividend in their Federal Reserve stock, and to other services.

== Background ==
Central banking has made various institutional appearances throughout the history of the United States. These institutions started with the First and Second banks of the United States, which were championed in large part by Alexander Hamilton.

=== First Bank of United States ===
The American financial system was deeply fragmented after the American Revolutionary War. The government was burdened with large wartime debts, and the new republic needed a strong financial institution to give the country a resilient financial footing. Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson had opposing views regarding whether or not the US could benefit from a European-style national financial institution. Hamilton was in favor of building a strong centralized political and economic institution to solve the country&#x27;s financial problem. He argued that a central bank could bring order to the US monetary system, manage the government&#x27;s revenues and payments, and provide credit to both the public and private sectors. On the other hand, Jefferson was deeply suspicious of a central bank because, he argued, it would undermine democracy. Jefferson and Southern members of congress also believed that a strong central financial institution would serve commercial interests of the north at the expense of Southern-based agriculture interests whose credit was provided by local banks during the post-revolutionary war era.
The First Bank of the United States was established in 1791 chartered for a period of twenty years. The US government was the largest shareholder of the bank. Despite its shareholder status, the government was not permitted to participate in management of the bank. The bank accepted deposits, issued bank notes, and provided short-term loans to the government. It also functioned as a clearinghouse for government debt. The bank could also regulate state-chartered banks to prevent overproduction of banknotes. The bank was very successful in financing the government and stimulating the economy. In spite of its successes, hostility against the bank did not fade. Jeffersonians questioned the bank&#x27;s constitutionality. In 1811, the first bank of the United States failed to be renewed by one vote in both the House and the Senate.

=== Second Bank of the United States ===
After the War of 1812, economic instability necessitated the creation of a second national bank. Due to expanding money supply and lack of supervision, individual bank activity sparked high inflation. In 1816, a second national bank was created with a charter of twenty years. Three years later, during the panic of 1819 the second bank of the United States was blamed for overextending credit in a land boom, and would tighten up credit policies following the panic.
The Second bank was unpopular among the western and southern state-chartered banks, and constitutionality of a national bank was questioned. President Jackson would come into office, and wished to end the current central bank during his presidency. Under the premise that the bank favored a small economic and political elite at the expense of the public majority, the Second Bank became private after its charter expired in 1836, and would undergo liquidation in 1841.

For nearly 80 years, the U.S. was without a central bank after the charter for the Second Bank of the United States was allowed to expire. After various financial panics, particularly a severe one in 1907, some Americans became persuaded that the country needed some sort of banking and currency reform that would, when threatened by financial panics, provide a ready reserve of liquid assets, and furthermore allow for currency and credit to expand and contract seasonally within the U.S. economy.

Some of this was chronicled in the reports of the National Monetary Commission (1909–1912), which was created by the Aldrich–Vreeland Act in 1908. Included in a report of the Commission, submitted to Congress on January 9, 1912, were recommendations and draft legislation with 59 sections, for proposed changes in U.S. banking and currency laws. The proposed legislation was known as the Aldrich Plan, named after the chairman of the Commission, Republican Senator Nelson W. Aldrich of Rhode Island.

The Plan called for the establishment of a National Reserve Association with 15 regional district branches and 46 geographically dispersed directors primarily from the banking profession. The Reserve Association would make emergency loans to member banks, print money, and act as the fiscal agent for the U.S. government. State and nationally chartered banks would have the option of subscribing to specified stock in their local association branch. It is generally believed that the outline of the Plan had been formulated in a secret meeting on Jekyll Island in November 1910, which Aldrich and other well connected financiers attended.

Since the Aldrich Plan gave too little power to the government, there was strong opposition to it from rural and western states because of fears that it would become a tool of bankers, specifically the Money Trust of New York City. Indeed, from May 1912 through January 1913 the Pujo Committee, a subcommittee of the House Committee on Banking and Currency, held investigative hearings on the alleged Money Trust and its interlocking directorates. These hearings were chaired by Rep. Arsene Pujo, a Democratic representative from Louisiana.

In the election of 1912, the Democratic Party won control of the White House and both chambers of Congress. The party&#x27;s platform stated strong opposition to the Aldrich Plan. The platform also called for a systematic revision of banking laws in ways that would provide relief from financial panics, unemployment and business depression, and would protect the public from the &quot;domination by what is known as the Money Trust.&quot; The final plan, however, was quite similar to the Aldrich Plan, with a few revisions. Sen. Carter Glass made these revisions, although the main premise of the Aldrich Plan was in there. Changes in the Banking and Currency System of the United States]. House Report No. 69, 63rd Congress to accompany H.R. 7837, submitted to the full House by Carter Glass, from the House Committee on Banking and Currency, September 9, 1913. A discussion of the deficiencies of the then current banking system as well as those in the Aldrich Plan and quotations from the 1912 Democratic platform are laid out in this report, pages 3–11.

== Legislative history ==
Attempts to reform currency and banking had been made in the United States prior to the introduction of H.R. 7837. The first major form of this type of legislation came through with the First Bank of the United States in 1791. Championed by Alexander Hamilton, this established a central bank that included in a three-part expansion of federal fiscal and monetary power (including federal mint and excise taxes). Attempts were made to extend this bank&#x27;s charter, but they would fail before the charters expiration in 1811. This led to the creation of the Second Bank of the United States. In 1816, the U.S. Congress chartered this Second bank for a twenty-year period to create irredeemable currency with which to pay for the costs of the War of 1812. The creation of congressionally authorized irredeemable currency by the Second Bank of the United States opened the door to the possibility of taxation by inflation. Congress did not want state-chartered banks as competition in the inflation of currency. The charter for the Second Bank would expire in 1836, leaving the U.S. without a central bank for nearly eighty years.

In the aftermath of the Panic of 1907, there was general agreement among leaders in both parties of the necessity to create some sort of central banking system to provide coordination during financial emergencies. Most leaders also sought currency reform, as they believed that the roughly $3.8 billion in coins and banknotes did not provide an adequate money supply during financial panics. Under conservative Republican Senator Nelson Aldrich&#x27;s leadership, the National Monetary Commission had put forward a plan to establish a central banking system that would issue currency and provide oversight and loans to the nation&#x27;s banks. However, many progressives distrusted the plan due to the degree of influence bankers would have over the central banking system. Relying heavily on the advice of Louis Brandeis, Wilson sought a middle ground between progressives such as William Jennings Bryan and conservative Republicans like Aldrich. He declared that the banking system must be &quot;public not private, [and] must be vested in the government itself so that the banks must be the instruments, not the masters, of business.&quot;

Democratic Congressman Carter Glass and Senator Robert L. Owen crafted a compromise plan in which private banks would control twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks, but a controlling interest in the system was placed in a central board filled with presidential appointees. The system of twelve regional banks was designed with the goal of diminishing Wall Street&#x27;s influence. Wilson convinced Bryan&#x27;s supporters that the plan met their demands for an elastic currency because Federal Reserve notes would be obligations of the government. The bill passed the House in September 1913, but it faced stronger opposition in the Senate. After Wilson convinced just enough Democrats to defeat an amendment put forth by bank president Frank A. Vanderlip that would have given private banks greater control over the central banking system, the Senate voted 54–34 to approve the Federal Reserve Act. Wilson signed the bill into law in December 1913.

== Amendments ==
The Federal Reserve Act was amended in major ways over time, e.g. to account for Hawaii and Alaska&#x27;s admission to the Union, for restructuring of the Fed&#x27;s districts, and to specify jurisdictions.

=== Monetary expansion in World War I ===
In June 1917 Congress passed major amendments to the Act in order to enable monetary expansion to cover the expected costs of World War I, which the US had just entered in April. The amendments allowed a more flexible definition of the gold backing the dollar currency in circulation. This relaxation de facto allowed less gold backing for each dollar note, and enabled the currency in circulation to more than double from $465m to $1247m just from June to December 1917. This reform has been argued to have been necessary to finance the expected $2 billion dollar cost of participating in the war for a year. Price inflation followed.

=== Charter extension ===
The Federal Reserve Act originally granted a twenty-year charter to the Federal Reserve Banks: &quot;To have succession for a period of twenty years from its organization unless it is sooner dissolved by an Act of Congress, or unless its franchise becomes forfeited by some violation of law.&quot;. This clause was amended on February 25, 1927: &quot;To have succession after the approval of this Act until dissolved by Act of Congress or until forfeiture of franchise for violation of law.&quot; The success of this amendment is notable, as in 1933, the US was in the throes of the Great Depression and public sentiment with regards to the Federal Reserve System and the banking community in general had significantly deteriorated. Given the political climate, including of Franklin D. Roosevelt’s administration and New Deal legislation, it is uncertain whether the Federal Reserve System would have survived.

=== Federal Open Market Committee ===
In 1933, by way of the Banking Act of 1933, the Federal Reserve Act was amended to create the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which consists of the seven members of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and five representatives from the Federal Reserve Banks. The FOMC is required to meet at least four times a year (in practice, the FOMC usually meets eight times) and has the power to direct all open-market operations of the Federal Reserve banks.

=== 12 USC § 225a ===
On November 16, 1977, the Federal Reserve Act was amended to require the Board and the FOMC &quot;to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.&quot; The Chairman was also required to appear before Congress at semi-annual hearings to report on the conduct of monetary policy, on economic development, and on the prospects for the future. The Federal Reserve Act has been amended by some 200 subsequent laws of Congress. It continues to be one of the principal banking laws of the United States. 

== Impact ==
The passing of the Federal Reserve act of 1913 carried implications both domestically and internationally for the United States economic system. The absence of a central banking structure in the U.S. previous to this act left a financial essence that was characterized by immobile reserves and inelastic currency. Creating the Federal Reserve gave the Federal Reserve control to regulate inflation, even though the government control over such powers would eventually lead to decisions that were controversial. Some of the most prominent implications include the internationalization of the U.S. Dollar as a global currency, the impact from the perception of the Central Bank structure as a public good by creating a system of financial stability (Parthemos 19-28), and the Impact of the Federal Reserve in response to economic panics. The Federal Reserve Act also permitted national banks to make mortgage loans for farm land, which had not been permitted previously.

== Criticisms ==

Throughout the history of the United States, there has been an enduring economic and political debate regarding the costs and benefits of central banking. Since the inception of a central bank in the United States, there were multiple opposing views to this type of economic system. Opposition was based on protectionist sentiment; a central bank would serve a handful of financiers at the expense of small producers, businesses, farmers and consumers, and could destabilize the economy through speculation and inflation. This created even further controversy over who would select the decision-makers in charge of the Federal Reserve. Proponents argued that a strong banking system could provide enough credit for a growing economy and avoid economic depressions. Other critical views included the belief that the bill gave too much power to the federal government after the senate revised the bill to create 12 board members who were each appointed by the president.

Preceding the creation of the Federal Reserve, no U.S. central banking systems lasted for more than 25 years. Some of the questions raised include: whether Congress has the Constitutional power to delegate its power to coin money (Article 1, Sec. 8, Clause 5, states: &quot;The Congress shall have power To coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin, and fix the Standard of Weights and Measures&quot;), whether the structure of the federal reserve is transparent enough, whether the Federal Reserve is a public Cartel of private banks (also called a private banking cartel) established to protect powerful financial interests, fears of inflation, high government deficits, and whether the Federal Reserve&#x27;s actions increased the severity of the Great Depression in the 1930s (and/or the severity or frequency of other boom-bust economic cycles, such as the late 2000s recession).

<doc id="55744" wikidata="Q1890568" url="?curid=55744" title="Mann Act">
<text>The Mann Act, previously called the White-Slave Traffic Act of 1910, is a United States federal law, passed June 25, 1910 (ch. 395, ; &quot;codified as amended at&quot; ). It is named after Congressman James Robert Mann of Illinois.

In its original form, the act made it a felony to engage in interstate or foreign commerce transport of &quot;any woman or girl for the purpose of prostitution or debauchery, or for any other immoral purpose&quot;. Its primary stated intent was to address prostitution, immorality, and human trafficking, particularly where trafficking was for the purposes of prostitution. It was one of several acts of protective legislation aimed at moral reform during the Progressive Era. In practice, its ambiguous language about &quot;immorality&quot; resulted in it being used to criminalize even consensual sexual behavior between adults. It was amended by Congress in 1978 and again in 1986 to limit its application to transport for the purpose of prostitution or other illegal sexual acts.

==Promotion==
In the 19th century, many of America&#x27;s cities had designated legally protected areas of prostitution. Increased urbanization, as well as greater numbers of young women entering the workforce, led to greater flexibility in courtship without supervision. It was in this changing social sphere that concern over &quot;white slavery&quot; began. This term referred to women kidnapped for the purposes of prostitution and derives from Charles Sumner&#x27;s 1847 description of the Barbary slave trade.

Numerous communities appointed vice commissions to investigate the extent of local prostitution, whether prostitutes participated in it willingly or were forced into it, and the degree to which it was organized by any cartel-type organizations. The second significant action at the local level was to close the brothels and the red-light districts. From 1910 to 1913, city after city changed previously tolerant approaches and forced the closing of their brothels. Opposition to openly practiced prostitution had been growing steadily throughout the last decades of the 19th century. The federal government&#x27;s response was the Mann Act. The purpose of the act was to make it a crime to &quot;transport or cause to be transported, or aid to assist in obtaining transportation for&quot; or to &quot;persuade, induce, entice or coerce&quot; a woman to travel. Many of the changes that occurred after 1900 were a result of tensions between social ideals and practical realities. Family form and functions changed in response to a complex set of circumstances that were the effects of economic class and ethnicity.

According to historian Mark Thomas Connelly, &quot;a group of books and pamphlets appeared announcing a startling claim: a pervasive and depraved conspiracy was at large in the land, brutally trapping and seducing American girls into lives of enforced prostitution, or &#x27;white slavery.&#x27; These white slave narratives, or white-slave tracts, began to circulate around 1909.&quot; Such narratives often portrayed innocent girls &quot;victimized by a huge, secret and powerful conspiracy controlled by foreigners&quot;, as they were drugged or imprisoned and forced into prostitution.

This excerpt from &quot;The War on the White Slave Trade&quot; was written by the United States District Attorney in Chicago:

According to Connelly, such concerns represented an &quot;hysterical&quot; version of genuine and long-standing issues arising from the concentration of young women from rural backgrounds in the expanding cities of the era, many of whom were drawn into prostitution for &quot;mundane&quot; economic reasons. A number of Vice Commission reports had drawn attention to the issue. Some contemporaries questioned the idea of abduction and foreign control of prostitution through cartels. For example, noted radical and feminist Emma Goldman asked &quot;What is really the cause of the trade in women? Not merely white women, but yellow and black women as well. Exploitation, of course; the merciless Moloch of capitalism that fattens on underpaid labor, thus driving thousands of women and girls into prostitution. With Mrs. Warren these girls feel, &#x27;Why waste your life working for a few shillings a week in a scullery, eighteen hours a day?&#x27; ... Whether our reformers admit it or not, the economic and social inferiority of woman is responsible for prostitution.&quot; While prostitution was widespread, contemporary studies by local vice commissions indicate that it was &quot;overwhelmingly locally organized without any large business structure, and willingly engaged in by the prostitutes.&quot;

Suffrage activists, especially Harriet Burton Laidlaw and Rose Livingston, took up the concerns. They worked in New York City&#x27;s Chinatown and in other cities to rescue young white and Chinese girls from forced prostitution, and helped pass the Mann Act to make interstate sex trafficking a federal crime. Other groups like the Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union and Hull House focused on children of prostitutes and poverty in community life while trying to pass protective legislation. The American Purity Alliance also supported the Mann Act.

==Legal application==

Although the law was created to stop forced sexual slavery of women, the most common use of the Mann Act was to prosecute men for having sex with underage females. The phrase &quot;immoral purpose&quot; in the statute allowed a broad application of the law following its affirmation in 

In addition to its stated purpose of preventing human trafficking, the law was used to prosecute unlawful premarital, extramarital, and interracial relationships. The penalties would be applied to men whether or not the woman involved consented and, if she had consented, the woman could be considered an accessory to the offense. Some attribute enactment of the law to the case of world champion heavyweight boxer Jack Johnson. Johnson was known to be intimate with white women, some of whom he met at the fighting venue after his fights. In 1912 he was prosecuted, and later convicted, for &quot;transporting women across state lines for immoral purposes&quot; as a result of his relationship with a white prostitute named Belle Schreiber; the month prior to the prosecution, Johnson had been charged with violating the Mann Act due to traveling with his white girlfriend, Lucille Cameron, who refused to cooperate with the prosecution and whom he married soon thereafter.

The 1948 prosecution of Frank LaSalle for abducting Florence Sally Horner is believed to have been an inspiration for Vladimir Nabokov in writing his novel &quot;Lolita&quot;. Humbert Humbert, the narrator, at one point explicitly refers to LaSalle. The Mann Act has also been used by the U.S. federal government to prosecute polygamists (such as Mormon fundamentalists) because the U.S. has no federal law against polygamy. All U.S. states have anti-polygamy laws, but only in recent years have state authorities used them to prosecute bigamy. Colorado City, Arizona; Hildale, Utah; Bountiful, British Columbia; and sites in Mexico are historic locations of several Mormon sects that practiced polygamy, although The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has expressly forbidden polygamy since the start of the 20th century. Sect leaders and individuals have been charged under the Mann Act when &quot;wives&quot; are transported across the Utah–Arizona state line or the U.S.–Canadian and U.S.–Mexican borders.

* Anwar al-Awlaki, an American Islamist cleric, was investigated for violations of Mann Act, authorities primarily wanting to arrest him for his ties to the 9/11 hijackers, but left the United States for Yemen before he could be detained.
* Dušan Popov, a World War II Allied double agent with a &quot;James Bond&quot; lifestyle, was threatened with arrest under the Mann Act.
* Individuals associated with the Emperors Club VIP prostitution ring that had Eliot Spitzer as a client while he was governor of New York.
* Individuals associated with the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS), such as Warren Jeffs and Merril Jessop have refused to answer questions during depositions and court hearings, citing the 5th Amendment, over concerns of self-incrimination related to &quot;potential state investigation still ongoing, as well as criminal investigations under the Mann Act out of the U.S. Attorney&#x27;s Office.&quot;

===Mann Act case decisions by the United States Supreme Court===
* &quot;Hoke v. United States&quot;, . The Court held that Congress could not regulate prostitution &quot;per se,&quot; as that was strictly the province of the states. Congress could, however, regulate interstate travel for purposes of prostitution or &quot;immoral purposes&quot;.
* &quot;Athanasaw v. United States&quot;, . The Court decided that the law was not limited strictly to prostitution, but to &quot;debauchery&quot; as well.
* &quot;Caminetti v. United States&quot;, . The Court decided that the Mann Act applied not strictly to purposes of prostitution, but to other noncommercial consensual sexual liaisons. Thus consensual extramarital sex falls within the genre of &quot;immoral sex&quot;.
* The Court ruled that consent by the victim to their own transportation does not constitute conspiracy or culpability under the Act.
* &quot;Cleveland v. United States&quot;, . The Court decided that a person can be prosecuted under the Mann Act even when married to the woman if the marriage is polygamous. Thus polygamous marriage was determined to be an &quot;immoral purpose&quot;.
* &quot;Bell v. United States&quot;, . The Court decided that simultaneous transportation of two women across state lines constituted only one violation of the Mann Act, not two violations.
* The Court affirmed that a victim can be compelled to testify against a spouse who violated the Act, in exception to the common law spousal privilege rule.
* The Court ruled that it is not impossible for a victim of the Act to be charged with conspiracy under specific circumstances. The requirements for conspiracy by a victim of the Act were limited in a later ruling, 

==Congressional amendments to the law==
In 1978, Congress updated the act&#x27;s definition of &quot;transportation&quot; and added protections against commercial sexual exploitation for minors. It added a 1986 amendment which further protected minors and added protection for adult males. In particular, as part of a larger 1986 bill focused on criminalizing various aspects of child pornography that passed unanimously in both houses of Congress, the Mann Act was further amended to replace the ambiguous &quot;debauchery&quot; and &quot;any other immoral purpose&quot; with the more specific &quot;any sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense&quot; as well as to make it gender-neutral.

==Effects and alterations of the Mann Act==
While the Mann Act was meant to combat forced prostitution, it had repercussions that extended into consensual sexual activity. Because it lacked specificity, it criminalized many who were not participating in prostitution. It became a way to persecute large numbers of unmarried couples participating in premarital or extramarital activities, especially when it involved black males such as Chuck Berry and Jack Johnson. The Mann Act also became a form of blackmail, by wives who were suspicious of cheating husbands or other women. This was the case for both Drew Caminetti and Maury Diggs. Both men from Sacramento, California, were married, and took their mistresses (Lola Norris and Marsha Warrington, respectively) to Reno, Nevada. The men&#x27;s wives contacted the police, and the men were arrested in Reno and found guilty under the Mann Act. One author wrote:

In 1914 a woman by the name of Jessie A. Cope was arrested in Chicago for attempting to bribe an official to assist her in the blackmail of Colonel Charles Alexander of Providence, Rhode Island, on a white slavery charge. The two had met two years previous in LA, Alexander had promised to divorce his wife, and marry her. When he attempted to leave her, Cope and her mother pursued him to Providence. Cope consulted lawyers in Providence and LA, then brought the charges in Chicago, where she was arrested.

Upon continuous blackmail accounts, &quot;The New York Times&quot; became an advocate against the Mann Act. In 1915, the paper published an editorial pointing out how the act led to extortion. In 1916, it labeled the Mann Act &quot;The Blackmail Act&quot;, arguing that its dangers had been clear from the start as the act could make a harmless spree or simple elopement a crime. The paper also called the &quot;blackmail that resulted from the Mann Act [...] worse than the prostitution it sought to suppress&quot;.

While the Mann Act has never been repealed, it has been amended and altered since its initial passing. The Mann Act continued essentially unchanged until 1978 amendments that expanded coverage to issues around child pornography and exploitation. Most recently, in 1986, the Mann Act was significantly altered to make the whole Act gender neutral and to redress the specific ambiguous phrasing that had enabled decades of unjust applications of the Act. With the 1986 amendments, the Mann Act outlaws interstate or foreign transport of &quot;any person&quot; for purposes of &quot;any sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense.&quot; Prior to the Supreme Court ruling in &quot;Lawrence v. Texas&quot; (2003), sodomy was illegal in many states which left open the possibility of prosecution under the Mann Act of consenting adult couples, especially gay couples, though there is no record of such enforcement actions.

Danny Cevallos of MSNBC stated that the &quot;White Slave Traffic Act&quot; name had, by 2024, fallen out of use.

<doc id="55745" wikidata="Q6751068" url="?curid=55745" title="Mann–Elkins Act">
<text>The Mann–Elkins Act, also called the Railway Rate Act of 1910, was a United States federal law that strengthened the authority of the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) over railroad rates. The law also expanded the ICC&#x27;s jurisdiction to include regulation of telephone, telegraph and wireless companies, and created a commerce court.

==Background==
President William Howard Taft was concerned about controlling unfair trade practices and competition in the railroad industry. During his 1908 presidential campaign, Taft called for a railroad rate law and policies to boost competition in the rail industry. His administration argued that the Interstate Commerce Act (1887) and the Hepburn Act (1906) were only partially effective in addressing problems that the railroads had imposed upon the national economy. Taft supported amending the Interstate Commerce Act to allow the ICC&#x27;s initiation of suspending of railroad rate increases (rather than just by responding to complaints). Taft also recommended that railroads should be allowed to arrange rate increases among themselves. (The latter proposal was not adopted in the enacted legislation.)

==Overview==
The Mann-Elkins Act was a piece of reform legislation developed during the Progressive era. The principal sponsors were Congressmen Stephen Benton Elkins and James Robert Mann. While there had been concern in Congress about the limited effectiveness of the ICC generally, the act was developed in direct response to rate increases that western railroads announced in 1910.

===Rate setting===
The 1910 act amended the 1887 and 1906 acts by authorizing the ICC to investigate railroad rate increases, suspending rates where warranted and placing the burden of proof upon the railroad for demonstrating reasonableness. The law mandated that the ICC is &quot;empowered to determine and prescribe what will be the just and reasonable individual or joint rate or rates...&quot; This was the first federal law to authorize setting of maximum rates for a single industry during peacetime. The &quot;long-and-short haul&quot; clause of the 1887 act was strengthened to prohibit railroads from charging passengers more for a short trip, compared to a longer ride, over the same route unless specifically approved by the ICC.

The Act terminated the railroad companies&#x27; ability to give free or discounted rates to those who were employees or family of employees.

===Regulation of additional industries===
The act extended the authority of the ICC to regulate the telecommunications industry, and designated telephone, telegraph and wireless companies as common carriers.

===Commerce court===
The act created the short-lived United States Commerce Court for adjudication of railway disputes. Any appeals from commerce court decisions would go directly to the United States Supreme Court, to increase the efficiency and speed of cases. This disallowed the railroad companies from dragging out long court cases. The Court presided until 1913, when it was abolished by Congress.

==Aftermath==
Following implementation of the act, railroads had difficulty securing revenue sufficient to keep pace with their rising costs, although the ICC had allowed some rate increases. Investors had overexpanded the nation&#x27;s trackage, so by late 1915 fully one-sixth of the railroad trackage in the country belonged to roads in receivership (bankruptcy). The national railway investment of 17.5 billion dollars, of which more than half was funded debt, had an estimated worth of sixteen billion dollars. As the United States considered entering World War I, the government identified nationwide inadequacies in terminals, trackage, and rolling stock. In December 1917 the ICC recommended federal control of the railroad industry to ensure efficient operation during wartime. President Woodrow Wilson issued an order for nationalisation of the railroads on December 26, 1917. The United States Railroad Administration was established to manage the railroads during the war, and was abolished in 1920 by the Esch–Cummins Act.

The Mann–Elkins Act paved the way for the Communications Act of 1934. The 1934 law consolidated portions of the Mann-Elkins Act and other laws affecting the telephone and radio industries, to create a unified authority for telecommunications within a new agency, the Federal Communications Commission.

<doc id="55751" wikidata="Q4693996" url="?curid=55751" title="Agricultural Marketing Act of 1929">
<text>The Agricultural Marketing Act of 1929, under the administration of Herbert Hoover, established the Federal Farm Board from the Federal Farm Loan Board established by the Federal Farm Loan Act of 1916 with a revolving fund of half a billion dollars. The original act was sponsored by Hoover in an attempt to stop the downward spiral of crop prices by seeking to buy, sell and store agricultural surpluses or by generously lending money to farm organizations. Money was lent out to the farmers in order to buy seed and food for the livestock, which was especially important since there had previously been a drought in the Democratic South. However, Hoover refused to lend to the farmers themselves, as he thought that it would be unconstitutional to do so and if they were lent money, they would become dependent on government money.

==Effects==
The Federal Farm Board&#x27;s purchase of surplus could not keep up with the production; as farmers realized that they could just sell the government their crops, they reimplemented the use of fertilizers and other techniques to increase production. Overall, the deflation could not be countered because of a massive fault in the bill: there was no production limit. Had there been a production limit, the deflation might have been helped somewhat. The funds appropriated were eventually exhausted and the losses of the farmers kept rising.

The H.R. 1 legislation was passed by the 71st Congressional session and enacted by the 31st President of the United States Herbert Hoover on June 15, 1929.

The Act was the precursor to the Agricultural Adjustment Act.

<text>The Indian Reorganization Act (IRA) of June 18, 1934, or the Wheeler–Howard Act, was U.S. federal legislation that dealt with the status of American Indians in the United States. It was the centerpiece of what has been often called the &quot;Indian New Deal&quot;.

The Act also restored to Indians the management of their assets—land and mineral rights—and included provisions intended to create a sound economic foundation for the residents of Indian reservations. Total U.S. spending on Indians averaged $38 million a year in the late 1920s, dropping to an all-time low of $23 million in 1933, and reaching $38 million in 1940.

The IRA was the most significant initiative of John Collier, who was President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s Commissioner of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) from 1933 to 1945. He had long studied Indian issues and worked for change since the 1920s, particularly with the American Indian Defense Association. He intended to reverse the assimilationist policies that had resulted in considerable damage to American Indian cultures and to provide a means for American Indians to re-establish sovereignty and self-government, reduce the losses of reservation lands, and build economic self-sufficiency. He believed that Indian traditional culture was superior to that of modern America and thought it worthy of emulation. His proposals were considered highly controversial, as numerous powerful interests had profited from the sale and management of Native lands. Congress revised Collier&#x27;s proposals and preserved oversight of tribes and reservations by the Bureau of Indian Affairs within the Department of Interior. Felix S. Cohen, an official at the Department of the Interior Solicitor&#x27;s Office, was another significant architect of the Indian New Deal who helped draft the 1934 act.

The self-government provisions would automatically go into effect for a tribe unless a clear majority of the eligible Indians voted it down.

==History==

===Background===
The process of allotment started with the General Allotment Act of 1887. By 1934, two-thirds of Indian land had converted to traditional private ownership (i.e., it was owned in fee simple). Most of that had been sold by Indian allottees, often because they could not pay local taxes on the lands they were newly responsible for. The IRA provided a mechanism for the recovery of land that had been previously sold, including land that had been sold to tribal Indians. They would lose individual property under the law.

John Collier was appointed Commissioner of the Indian Bureau (it is now called the Bureau of Indian Affairs, BIA) in April 1933 by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. He had the full support of his boss, Secretary of the Interior Harold L. Ickes, who was also an expert on Indian issues.

The federal government held land in trust for many tribes. Numerous claims cases had been presented to Congress because of failures in the government&#x27;s management of such lands. There were particular grievances and claims due to the government&#x27;s failure to provide for sustainable forestry. The Indian Claims Act of 1946 included a requirement that the Interior Department manage Indian forest resources &quot;on the principle of sustained-yield management.&quot; Representative Edgar Howard of Nebraska, co-sponsor of the Act and Chairman of the House Committee on Indian Affairs, explained that the purpose of the provision was &quot;to assure a proper and permanent management of the Indian Forest&quot; under modern sustained-yield methods to &quot;assure that the Indian forests will be permanently productive and will yield continuous revenues to the tribes.&quot;

===Implementation and results===
The act slowed the practice of allotting communal tribal lands to individual tribal members. It did not restore to Indians land that had already been patented to individuals. However, much land at that time was still unallotted or allotted to an individual but still held in trust for that individual by the U.S. government. Because the Act did not disturb existing private ownership of Indian reservation lands, it left reservations as a checkerboard of tribal or individual trust and fee land, which remains the case today.

However, the Act also allowed the U.S. to purchase some of the fee land and restore it to tribal trust status. Due to the Act and other federal courts and government actions, more than two million acres (8,000 km2) of land were returned to various tribes in the first 20 years after passage.

In 1954, the United States Department of the Interior (DOI) began implementing the termination and relocation phases of the Act, which had been added by Congress. These provisions resulted from the continuing interest of some members of Congress in having American Indians assimilate into the majority society. Among other effects, termination resulted in the legal dismantling of 61 tribal nations within the United States and ending their recognized relationships with the federal government. This also ended the eligibility of the tribal nations and their members for various government programs to assist American Indians. Of the &quot;Dismantled Tribes&quot; 46 regained their legal status as indigenous communities.

===Constitutional challenges===
Since the late 20th century and the rise of Indian activism over sovereignty issues, as well as many tribes&#x27; establishment of casino gambling on reservations as a revenue source, the U.S. Supreme Court has been repeatedly asked to address the IRA&#x27;s constitutionality. A controversial provision of the Act allows the U.S. government to acquire non-Indian land (by voluntary transfer) and convert it to Indian land (&quot;take it into trust&quot;). In doing so, the U.S. government partially removes the land from the state&#x27;s jurisdiction, allowing activities like casino gambling on the land for the first time. It also exempts the land from state property and other state taxes. Consequently, many state or local governments opposed the IRA and filed lawsuits challenging its constitutionality.

In 1995, South Dakota challenged the authority of the Interior Secretary, under the IRA, to take of land into trust on behalf of the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe (based on the Lower Brule Indian Reservation) in &quot;South Dakota v. United States Dep&#x27;t of the Interior&quot;, 69 F.3d 878, 881-85 (8th Cir. 1995). The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals found Section 5 of the IRA to be unconstitutional, ruling that it violated the nondelegation doctrine and that the Secretary of Interior did not have the authority to take the land into trust.

The U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) sought a U.S. Supreme Court review. But, as DOI was implementing new regulations related to land trusts, the agency asked the Court to remand the case to the lower court for reconsideration with the decision based on the new regulations. The U.S. Supreme Court granted the DOI&#x27;s petition, vacated the lower court&#x27;s ruling, and remanded the case back to the lower court.

Justices Antonin Scalia, Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor, and Clarence Thomas dissented, stating that &quot;[t]he decision today—to grant, vacate, and remand in light of the Government&#x27;s changed position—is both unprecedented and inexplicable.&quot; They went on, &quot;[W]hat makes today&#x27;s action inexplicable as well as unprecedented is the fact that the Government&#x27;s change of legal position does not even purport to be applicable to the present case.&quot; Seven months after the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision to grant, vacate, and remand, the DOI removed the land in question from trust.

In 1997, the Lower Brulé Sioux submitted an amended trust application to the DOI, requesting that the United States take the of land into trust on the Tribe&#x27;s behalf. South Dakota challenged this in 2004 in district court, which upheld DOI&#x27;s authority to take the land in trust. The state appealed to the Eighth Circuit, but when the court reexamined the constitutionality issue, it upheld the constitutionality of Section 5 in agreement with the lower court. The U.S. Supreme Court denied the State&#x27;s petition for &quot;certiorari&quot;. Since then, district and circuit courts have rejected claims of non-delegation by states. The Supreme Court refused to hear the issue in 2008.

In 2008 (before the U.S. Supreme Court heard the &quot;Carcieri&quot; case below), in &quot;MichGO v Kempthorne&quot;, Judge Janice Rogers Brown of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals wrote a dissent stating that she would have struck down key provisions of the IRA. Of the three circuit courts to address the IRA&#x27;s constitutionality, Judge Brown is the only judge to dissent on the IRA&#x27;s constitutionality. The majority opinion upheld its constitutionality. The U.S. Supreme Court did not accept the &quot;MichGO&quot; case for review, thus keeping the previous precedent in place. Additionally, the First, Eighth, and Tenth Circuits of the U.S. Court of Appeals have upheld the constitutionality of the IRA.

In 2008, &quot;Carcieri v Kempthorne&quot; was argued before the U.S. Supreme Court; the Court ruled on it in 2009, with the decision called &quot;Carcieri v. Salazar&quot;. In 1991, the Narragansett Indian tribe bought of land. They requested that the DOI take it into trust, which the agency did in 1998, thus exempting it from many state laws. The State was concerned that the tribe would open a casino or tax-free business on the land and sued to block the transfer. The state argued that the IRA did not apply because the Narragansett was not &quot;now under federal jurisdiction&quot; as of 1934, as distinguished from &quot;federally recognized.&quot; In fact, the Narragansett had been placed under Rhode Island guardianship since 1709. In 1880, the tribe was illegally pressured into relinquishing its tribal authority to Rhode Island. Some historians disagree that the action was illegal because, although not sanctioned by Congress, it was &quot;desired&quot; by the tribe members. The tribe did not receive federal recognition until 1983, after the 1934 passage of the IRA. The U.S. Supreme Court agreed with the State.

In a challenge to the U.S. DOI&#x27;s decision to take land into trust for the Oneida Indian Nation in present-day New York, Upstate Citizens for Equality (UCE), New York, Oneida County, Madison County, the town of Verona, the town of Vernon, and others argued that the IRA is unconstitutional. Judge Kahn dismissed UCE&#x27;s complaint, including the failed theory that the IRA is unconstitutional, on the basis of longstanding and settled law on this issue. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the dismissal.

=== Approval by tribes ===

Section 18 of the IRA required that members of the affected Indian nation or tribe vote on whether to accept it within one year of the effective date of the act (25 U.S.C. 478) and had to approve it by a majority. There was confusion about who should be allowed to vote on creating new governments, as many non-Indians lived on reservations and many Indians owned no land there, and also over the effect of abstentions.
Under the voting rules, abstentions were counted as yes votes, but in Oglala Lakota culture, for example, abstention had traditionally equaled a no vote. The resulting confusion caused disputes on many reservations about the results.
When the final results were in, 172 tribes had accepted the act, and 75 had rejected it. The largest tribe, the Navajo, had been badly hurt by the federal Navajo Livestock Reduction Program, which took away half their livestock and jailed dissenters. They strongly opposed the act, the chief promoter John Collier, and the entire Indian New Deal. Historian Brian Dippie notes that the Indian Rights Association denounced Collier as a &quot;dictator&quot; and accused him of a &quot;near reign of terror&quot; on the Navajo reservation. Dippie adds, &quot;[h]e became an object of &#x27;burning hatred&#x27; among the very people whose problems so preoccupied him.&quot;

==Legacy==
Historians have mixed reactions to the Indian New Deal. Many praise Collier&#x27;s energy and his initiative. Kenneth R. Philp praised Collier&#x27;s Indian New Deal for protecting Indian freedom to engage in traditional religious practices, obtaining additional relief money for reservations, providing a structure for self-government, and enlisting the help of anthropologists who respected traditional cultures. However, he concludes that the Indian New Deal was unable to stimulate economic progress, nor did it provide a usable structure for Indian politics. Philp argues these failures gave ammunition to the return to the previous policy of termination that took place after Collier resigned in 1945. In surveying the scholarly literature, E. A. Schwartz concludes that there is:
:a near consensus among historians of the Indian New Deal that Collier temporarily rescued Indian communities from federal abuses and helped Indian people survive the Depression but also damaged Indian communities by imposing his own social and political ideas on them.

Collier&#x27;s reputation among the Indians was mixed—praised by some, vilified by others. Though highly regarded by most Indian tribes he assisted, Collier antagonized the Navajo, the largest tribe, as well as the Seneca people, Iroquois, and many others. Some anthropologists criticized him for not recognizing the diversity of Native American lifestyles. Hauptman argues that his emphasis on Northern Pueblo arts and crafts and the uniformity of his approach to all tribes are partly explained by his belief that his tenure as Commissioner would be short, meaning that packaging large, lengthy legislative reforms seemed politically necessary. Despite being outspokenly critical of the American society&#x27;s treatment of Indians, and also making a serious effort to increase art participation among Indians, Collier was also acknowledged for the vital effort he made to spread his own ideas about romanticism on tribes he assisted as well.

The Reorganization Act was wide-ranging legislation authorizing tribal self-rule under federal supervision, ending land allotment, and generally promoting measures to enhance tribes and encourage education.

Having described the American society as &quot;physically, religiously, socially, and aesthetically shattered, dismembered, directionless&quot;, Collier was later criticized for his romantic views about the moral superiority of traditional society as opposed to modernity. Philp says after his experience at the Taos Pueblo, Collier &quot;made a lifelong commitment to preserve tribal community life because it offered a cultural alternative to modernity...His romantic stereotyping of Indians often did not fit the reality of contemporary tribal life.&quot;

The act has helped conserve the communal tribal land bases. Collier supporters blame Congress for altering the legislation proposed by Collier, so that it has not been as successful as possible. On many reservations, its provisions exacerbated longstanding differences between traditionals and those who had adopted more European-American ways. Many Native Americans believe their traditional systems of government were better for their culture.

<doc id="55755" wikidata="Q2364046" url="?curid=55755" title="Fordney–McCumber Tariff">
<text>The Fordney–McCumber Tariff of 1922 was a law that raised American tariffs on many imported goods to protect factories and farms. The US Congress displayed a pro-business attitude in passing the tariff and in promoting foreign trade by providing huge loans to Europe. That, in turn, bought more US goods. However, five years after the passage of the tariff, American trading partners had raised their own tariffs by a significant degree. France raised its tariffs on automobiles from 45% to 100%, Spain raised its tariffs on American goods by 40%, and Germany and Italy raised their tariffs on wheat. According to the American Farm Bureau, farmers lost more than $300 million annually as a result of the tariff.

==Background==
The first sector of the economy that was hit by a fall in postwar demand was agriculture. During World War I, the American agricultural industry had enjoyed prosperity through the raising of prices, which led to increased output that Americans used to supply Europe.

Farmers borrowed heavily to expand their acreage and had difficulty paying back the loans when prices fell. Some of the postwar problems for American agriculture come from the great surplus of farm goods, which could not be absorbed in the national market as European countries had recovered sufficiently from the war, with their markets no longer requiring large quantities of American agricultural products.

Gross farm income in 1919 amounted to $17.7 billion. By 1921, exports to Europe had plummeted, and farm income fell to $10.5 billion. Other sectors of the economy wanted to avoid a similar fate. The 1920 election put the conservative pro-business and pro-farm Republicans in control of both Congress and the White House.

Hearings were held by Congress and led to the creation of several new tools of protection. One was the scientific tariff to equalize production costs among countries; no country could undercut the prices charged by American companies. The difference of production costs was calculated by the Tariff Commission.

Another was the American selling price; it allowed the President to calculate the duty, which was based on the price of the American price of a good, not the imported good.

The bill also gave the President the power to raise or lower rates on products if that was recommended by the Tariff Commission.

In September 1922, the Fordney–McCumber Tariff bill (named after Joseph Fordney, the chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, and Porter McCumber, the chair of the Senate Finance Committee) was signed by President Warren Harding. In the end, the tariff law raised the American ad valorem tariff rate to an average of about 38.5% for dutiable imports and an average of 14% overall. The tariff was defensive, rather than offensive, as it was determined by the cost of production and the market value.

==Economic effects==
For agriculture, the tariff raised the purchasing power of the farmers by 2–3%, but other industries raised the price of some farm equipment. In September 1926, economic statistics released by farming groups revealed the rising cost of farm machinery.

For example, the average cost of a harness rose from $46 in 1918 to $75 in 1926, the 14-inch plow rose from $14 to $28, mowing machines rose from $45 to $95, and farm wagons rose from $85 to $150.

That triggered a tariff war against other European countries that traded with the United States. As US tariffs raised, those in other countries followed.

According to the American Farm Bureau, farmers lost more than $300 million annually as a result of the tariff.

==Reactions==
The tariff was supported by the Republican Party and conservatives and was generally opposed by the Democratic Party, liberals, and progressives. One purpose of the tariff was to help those returning from World War I have greater job opportunities.

Trading partners complained immediately. European nations affected by the war sought access for their exports to the American market to make payments to the war loans from America. Democratic Representative Cordell Hull warned, &quot;Our foreign markets depend both on the efficiency of our production and the tariffs of countries in which we would sell. Our own [high] tariffs are an important factor in each. They injure the former and invite the latter.&quot;

Five years after the passage of the tariff, American trading partners had raised their own tariffs by a significant degree. France raised its tariffs on automobiles from 45% to 100%, Spain raised its tariffs on American goods by 40%, and Germany and Italy raised their tariffs on wheat.

In 1928, Henry Ford attacked the tariff and argued that the American automobile industry did not need protection since it dominated the domestic market. Its main interest was now to expand foreign sales.

Some farmers opposed the tariff and blamed it for the agricultural depression. The American Farm Bureau Federation claimed that because of the tariff, the raised price of raw wool cost to farmers $27 million. Democratic Senator David I. Walsh challenged the tariff by arguing that the farmers were net exporters and so did not need protection. They depended on foreign markets to sell their surplus. Walsh pointed out that during the first year of the tariff, the cost of living climbed higher than any other year except during the war. He presented a survey of the Department of Labor in which all of the 32 cities that were assessed had seen an increase in the cost of living. For example, the food costs increased 16.5% in Chicago and 9.4% in New York. Clothing prices rose by 5.5% in Buffalo and 10.2% in Chicago.

Republican Frank W. Murphy, the head of the Minnesota Farm Bureau, also claimed that the problem was not in the world price of farm products but in the things that farmers had to buy.

<text>A Shepard tone, named after Roger Shepard, is a sound consisting of a superposition of sine waves separated by octaves. When played with the bass pitch of the tone moving upward or downward, it is referred to as the &quot;Shepard scale&quot;. This creates the auditory illusion of a tone that seems to continually ascend or descend in pitch, yet which ultimately gets no higher or lower.

== Construction==

Each square in Figure 1 indicates a tone, with any set of squares in vertical alignment together making one Shepard tone. The color of each square indicates the loudness of the note, with purple being the quietest and green the loudest. Overlapping notes that play at the same time are exactly one octave apart, and each scale fades in and fades out so that hearing the beginning or end of any given scale is impossible. 

As a conceptual example of an ascending Shepard scale, the first tone could be an almost inaudible C4 (middle C) and a loud C5 (an octave higher). The next would be a slightly louder C4 and a slightly quieter C5; the next would be a still louder D4 and a still quieter D5. The two frequencies would be equally loud at the middle of the octave (F4 and F5), and the twelfth tone would be a loud B4 and an almost inaudible B5 with the addition of an almost inaudible B3. The thirteenth tone would then be the same as the first, and the cycle could continue indefinitely. (In other words, each tone consists of two sine waves with frequencies separated by octaves; the intensity of each is e.g. a raised cosine function of its separation in semitones from a peak frequency, which in the above example would be B4. According to Shepard, &quot;almost any smooth distribution that tapers off to subthreshold levels at low and high frequencies would have done as well as the cosine curve actually employed.&quot;

The theory behind the illusion was demonstrated during an episode of the BBC&#x27;s show &quot;Bang Goes the Theory&quot;, where the effect was described as &quot;a musical barber&#x27;s pole&quot;.

The scale as described, with discrete steps between each tone, is known as the discrete Shepard scale. The illusion is more convincing if there is a short time between successive notes (staccato or marcato rather than legato or portamento).

==Variants==
===Shepard–Risset glissando===
Jean-Claude Risset subsequently created a version of the scale where the tones glide continuously, and it is appropriately called the continuous Risset scale or Shepard–Risset glissando. When done correctly, the tone appears to rise (or fall) continuously in pitch, yet return to its starting note. Risset has also created a similar effect with rhythm in which tempo seems to increase or decrease endlessly.
===Tritone paradox===

A sequentially played pair of Shepard tones separated by an interval of a tritone (half an octave) produces the tritone paradox. Shepard had predicted that the two tones would constitute a bistable figure, the auditory equivalent of the Necker cube, that could be heard ascending or descending, but never both at the same time.

In 1986, Diana Deutsch discovered that the perception of which tone was higher depended on the absolute frequencies involved and that an individual would usually hear the same pitch as the highest (this is determined by the absolute pitch of the notes). Interestingly, different listeners may perceive the same pattern as being either ascending or descending, depending on the language or dialect of the listener (Deutsch, Henthorn, and Dolson found that native speakers of Vietnamese, a tonal language, heard the tritone paradox differently from Californians who were native speakers of English).

=== Perpetual melody ===
Pedro Patricio observed in 2012 that, by using a Shepard tone as a sound source and applying it to a melody, he could reproduce the illusion of a continuously ascending or descending movement characteristic of the Shepard Scale. Regardless of the tempo and the envelope of the notes, the auditory illusion is effectively maintained. The uncertainty of the scale the Shepard tones pertain allows composers to experiment with deceiving and disconcerting melodies.

== Examples ==
* James Tenney&#x27;s &quot;For Ann (rising)&quot; consists entirely of a Shepard tone glissando with gradual modulations.
* A section near the end of Karlheinz Stockhausen&#x27;s &quot;Hymnen&quot; incorporates multiple descending Shepard tone glissandos.
* The ending of The Beatles&#x27; &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot; incorporates a Shepard tone with a chord progression built on ascending and descending lines in the bass and strings that line up to create the auditory illusion.
* The ending of Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Echoes&quot; from their 1971 album &quot;Meddle&quot; features an ascending Shepard tone created using a feedback technique involving two tape recorders sharing a single tape, with one set to play and the other to record.
* Queen&#x27;s 1976 album &quot;A Day at the Races&quot; opens and closes with a Shepard tone.
* In his 1979 book &quot;Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid&quot;, Douglas Hofstadter explained how Shepard scales could be used on the &quot;Canon a 2, per tonos&quot; in Bach&#x27;s &quot;Musical Offering&quot; (called the &quot;Endlessly Rising Canon&quot; by Hofstadter) for making the modulation end in the same pitch instead of an octave higher.
* In 1995, Ira Braus argued that the final sequence of Franz Liszt&#x27;s 1885 piano piece &quot;Bagatelle sans tonalité&quot; could be continued to produce a Shepard scale using Hofstadter&#x27;s technique.
* In a 1967 AT&amp;T film by Shepard and E. E. Zajac, a Shepard tone accompanies the ascent of an analogous Penrose stair.
*In the video game &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; (1996) for the Nintendo 64 console, a piece that plays when the player tries to climb the neverending stairs located in the penultimate room of Peach&#x27;s Castle incorporates a slightly modified Shepard scale played in the background. This auditory illusion complements the spatial loop effect, seemingly giving the impression that the stairs never end.
* In Godspeed You! Black Emperor&#x27;s &quot;The Dead Flag Blues&quot; from their 1997 album &quot;F♯ A♯ ∞&quot;, a section mainly consisting of slide guitar is briefly looped into itself to create a downward Shepard tone.
*On their 1998 album &quot;LP5&quot;, English electronic duo Autechre employed a decelerating Risset rhythm for the track &quot;Fold4,Wrap5&quot;.
*Austrian composer Georg Friedrich Haas incorporates Shepard tones at various points in his orchestral piece &quot;in vain&quot; (2000/02).
* Christopher Nolan said in an interview that the soundtrack of his 2006 film &quot;The Prestige&quot; (composed by David Julyan) explores the potential of Shepard tones as a fundamental basis for compositions. This is fully realised in his 2017 film &quot;Dunkirk where&quot; a Shepard tone is used to create the illusion of an ever increasing moment of intensity across intertwined storylines.
* In Stephin Merritt&#x27;s 2007 song &quot;Man of a Million Faces&quot;, composed for NPR&#x27;s &quot;Project Song&quot;, the Shepard tone is a key aspect.
* In the 2008 film &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; and its 2012 followup &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot;, a Shepard tone was used to create the sound of the Batpod, a motorcycle that the filmmakers did not want to change gear and tone abruptly but to accelerate constantly.
* The 2009 progressive house song &quot;Leave the World Behind&quot; by Swedish House Mafia features a Shepard tone in the form of an ongoing &quot;riser&quot; to build up the tension throughout the track.
*In Lucrecia Martel&#x27;s feature film &quot;Zama&quot; (2017), there is extensive use of the Shepard tone creating a &quot;loud and shreechy soundscape, in order to achieve closeness to the viewer&quot;, according to the director.
* The 2018 track &quot;Always Ascending&quot; by Franz Ferdinand from the album of the same name features a rising Shepard tone throughout the song. The video for the song echoes the effect, with the camera apparently rising continually throughout.
*In Sumio Kobayashi&#x27;s piano work &quot;Unreal Rain&quot;, the Shepard tone is entirely used.
*In the song &quot;Fear Inoculum&quot;, Tool drummer Danny Carey introduces the track with the Shepard tone

<doc id="55758" wikidata="Q1335451" url="?curid=55758" title="Emergency Quota Act">
<text>The Emergency Quota Act, also known as the Emergency Immigration Act of 1921, the Immigration Restriction Act of 1921, the Per Centum Law, and the Johnson Quota Act (ch. 8, of May 19, 1921), was formulated mainly in response to the large influx of Southern and Eastern Europeans and restricted their immigration to the United States. Although intended as temporary legislation, it &quot;proved, in the long run, the most important turning-point in American immigration policy&quot; because it added two new features to American immigration law: numerical limits on immigration and the use of a quota system for establishing those limits, which came to be known as the National Origins Formula.

The Emergency Quota Act restricted the number of immigrants admitted from any country annually to 3% of the number of residents from that country living in the United States as of the 1910 Census. That meant that people from Northern and Western Europe had a higher quota and were more likely to be admitted to the US than those from Eastern or Southern Europe or from non-European countries.

However, professionals were to be admitted without regard to their country of origin. Also, no limits were set on immigration from Canada, Newfoundland, Cuba, Mexico, or the countries of Central America and South America or &quot;adjacent islands.&quot; The act did not apply to countries with bilateral agreements with the US or to Asian countries listed in the Immigration Act of 1917, known as the Asiatic Barred Zone Act.

The Immigration Act of 1924 reduced the quota to 2% of countries&#x27; representation in the 1890 census, when a fairly small percentage of the population was from the regions some regarded as less than desirable. To execute the new quota, a visa system was implemented in 1924. It mandated non-citizens seeking to enter the US to obtain and present a visa obtained from a US embassy or consulate before arriving in the US. The visa regulations were later substantially revised by the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 and ultimately replaced by the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965. Non-citizens of the U.S. who are citizens or nationals of 40 countries are currently exempted from a visa requirement under the Visa Waiver Program.

Immigration inspectors differently handle visa packets depending on whether they are non-immigrant (visitor) or immigrant (permanent admission). Under the original, unmodified law, non-immigrant visas were kept at the ports of entry and were later destroyed, but immigrant visas were sent to the Central Office, in Washington, DC, for processing and filing.

Based on the new formula, the number of new immigrants admitted fell from 805,228 in 1920 to 309,556 in 1921–22. The average annual inflow of immigrants prior to 1921 was 175,983 from Northern and Western Europe and 685,531 from other countries, mainly Southern and Eastern Europe. In 1921, there was a drastic reduction in immigration levels from other countries, principally Southern and Eastern Europe.

The act, sponsored by US Representative Albert Johnson (R-Washington), was passed without a recorded vote in the US House of Representatives and by a vote of 90-2-4 in the US Senate.

The act was revised by the Immigration Act of 1924.

The use of the National Origins Formula continued until it was replaced by the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which introduced a system of preferences, based on immigrants&#x27; skills and family relationships with US citizens or US residents.

== Quotas by country under successive laws ==
Listed below are historical quotas on immigration from the Eastern Hemisphere, by country, as applied in given fiscal years ending June 30, calculated according to successive immigration laws and revisions from the Emergency Quota Act of 1921 to the final quota year of 1965. The 1922 and 1925 systems based on dated census records of the foreign-born population were intended as temporary measures, and were replaced by the 1924 Act&#x27;s National Origins Formula based on the 1920 Census of the total U.S. population, effective July 1, 1929.

<text>The Transportation Act, 1920, commonly known as the Esch–Cummins Act, was a United States federal law that returned railroads to private operation after World War I, with much regulation. It also officially encouraged private consolidation of railroads and mandated that the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) ensure their profitability. The act was named after Rep. John J. Esch and Sen. Albert B. Cummins. 

==Background==
The United States had entered World War I in April 1917, and the government found that the nation&#x27;s railroads were not prepared to serve the war effort. On December 26, 1917, President Woodrow Wilson had ordered that U.S. railroads be nationalized in the public interest. This order was implemented through the creation of the United States Railroad Administration. Congress ratified the order in the &quot;Railway Administration Act of 1918.&quot;

==Major provisions==
* Terminated federal control of railroads from March 1, 1920.
* Authorized the government to make settlements with railroad carriers for matters caused by nationalization, such as compensation and other expenses.
* Directed the ICC to prepare and adopt a plan for the consolidation of the railway properties of the United States into a limited number of systems. &quot;See&quot; Ripley Plan to consolidate railroads into regional systems.
* Granted authority to the ICC to set minimum shipping rates, oversee railroads&#x27; financial operations, and regulate acquisitions and mergers.
* Established procedures for settling labor disputes between railroads and employees. A Railroad Labor Board was created to regulate wages and settle disputes.
==Subsequent legislation==
Title III of the Esch–Cummins Act, which pertained to labor disputes, was repealed in 1926 by the Railway Labor Act.

<text>The National Prohibition Act, known informally as the Volstead Act, was an act of the 66th United States Congress designed to execute the 18th Amendment (ratified January 1919) which established the prohibition of alcoholic drinks. The Anti-Saloon League&#x27;s Wayne Wheeler conceived and drafted the bill, which was named after Andrew Volstead, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, who managed the legislation.

== Historical context ==
The Volstead Act had a number of contributing factors that led to its ratification in 1919. For example, the formation of the Anti-Saloon League in 1893. The league used the after effects of World War I to push for national prohibition because there was a lot of prejudice and suspicion of foreigners following the war. Many reformers used the war to get measures passed and a major example of this was national prohibition. The league was successful in getting many states to ban alcohol prior to 1917 by claiming that to drink was to be pro-German and this had the intended results because many of the major breweries at the time had German names. Additionally, many saloons were immigrant-dominated which further supported the narrative that the Anti-Saloon League was pushing for. Another factor that led to the passage of the Volstead Act was the idea that in order to feed the allied nations there was a greater need for the grain that was being used to make whiskey. Prohibitionists also argued that the manufacture and transportation of liquor was taking away from the needed resources that were already scarce going into WWI. They argued that Congress would have conserved food and coal much earlier had not liquor interests been placed above public welfare. This led to the War Time Prohibition Act in 1918. The case for wartime prohibition was strong and the prohibitionists could use their early successes under the necessities of mobilization to make the change permanent through a constitutional amendment in 1919.
== Passage of the Volstead Act ==
H.R. 6810, was the full name given to the National Prohibition Act, which in short meant, &quot;An act to prohibit intoxicating beverages, and to regulate the manufacture, production, and sale of high-proof spirits for other than beverage purposes, and to ensure an ample supply of alcohol and promote its use in scientific research and in the development of fuel, dye, and other lawful industries.&quot; Prohibition was originally proposed by a man by the name of Richmond Hobson, and the proposition was brought to Congress as an amendment to the Constitution. Later, attorney Wayne Wheeler proposed the first version of the bill, which Congress amended many times. President Woodrow Wilson vetoed the bill, Congress overrode his veto, and the bill went through on October 28, 1919. The Volstead Act went into play on January 16, 1920, where it became a challenge for the United States Supreme Court to navigate through. The Volstead Act was presented to help promote the togetherness of federal and state legislation in regulating alcohol.

== Content of the Volstead Act ==
The Volstead Act consisted of three main sections: (1) previously enacted war Prohibition, (2) Prohibition as designated by the Eighteenth Amendment, and (3) industrial alcohol use. Before the ratification of the Eighteenth Amendment, the War Time Prohibition Act was approved on November 21, 1918. This was passed to conserve grain by prohibiting its usage in the production of spirits. Title II of the Volstead Act, &quot;Permanent National Prohibition,&quot; which was defined as &quot;intoxicating beverages&quot; containing greater than 0.5 percent alcohol. This section also set forth the fines and jail sentences for the manufacture, sale and movement of alcoholic beverages, as well as set forth regulations that described those who would enforce the laws, what search and seizure powers law enforcement had or did not have, as well as how adjunction of violations would be in place, among many others. Despite these strict laws on alcohol commerce, there were numerous ways in which the possession and personal use of alcohol remained legal under the Volstead Act. It was in fact legal to own alcoholic beverages that were obtained before the Prohibition, as well as serve these types of drinks to family or guests in the home with proof of purchase on hand. This allowed numerous individuals, specifically those who were wealthy to stockpile these beverages before Prohibition. Alcohol that was used for medical purposes remained legal under the Volstead Act. Physicians were limited on what they could prescribe their patients. They were allowed one pint of spirits every ten days, a restriction the American Medical Associate opposed for being inadequate. Pastors, priests, ministers, rabbis and others who practiced religious actions could acquire a permit to provide alcohol for sacramental purposes only. Alcohol for any industrial purposes were allowed in Title III of the Volstead Act, titled &quot;Industrial Purposes.&quot;

==Enforcement and impact==
The production, importation, and distribution of alcoholic beverages—once the province of legitimate business—was taken over by criminal gangs, which fought each other for market control in violent confrontations, including murder. Major gangsters, such as Omaha&#x27;s Tom Dennison and Chicago&#x27;s Al Capone, became rich, and were admired locally and nationally. Enforcement was difficult because the gangs became so rich that they were often able to bribe underpaid and understaffed law-enforcement personnel, and afford expensive lawyers. Many citizens were sympathetic to bootleggers, and respectable citizens were lured by the romance of illegal speakeasies, also called &quot;blind tigers.&quot; The loosening of social mores during the 1920s included popularizing the cocktail and the cocktail party among higher socioeconomic groups. Those inclined to help authorities were often intimidated and even murdered. In several major cities—notably those that served as major points of liquor importation, including Chicago and Detroit—gangs wielded significant political power. A Michigan State Police raid on Detroit&#x27;s Deutsches Haus once netted the mayor, the sheriff, and the local congressman.

Prohibition came into force at 12:00:01 am on January 17, 1920, and the first documented infringement of the Volstead Act occurred in Chicago on January 17 at 12:59 am. According to police reports, six armed men stole $100,000 worth of &quot;medicinal&quot; whiskey from two freight-train cars. This trend in bootlegging liquor created a domino effect among criminals across the United States. Some gang leaders had been stashing liquor months before the Volstead Act was enforced. The ability to sustain a lucrative business in bootlegging liquor was largely helped by the minimal police surveillance at the time. There were only 134 agents designated by the Prohibition Unit to cover all of Illinois, Iowa, and parts of Wisconsin. According to Charles C. Fitzmorris, Chicago&#x27;s chief of police during the beginning of the Prohibition period, &quot;Sixty percent of my police [were] in the bootleg business.&quot;

Section 29 of the Act allowed 200 gallons (the equivalent of about 1000 750-ml bottles) of &quot;non-intoxicating cider and fruit juice&quot; to be made each year at home. Initially &quot;intoxicating&quot; was defined as exceeding 0.5% alcohol by volume, but the Bureau of Internal Revenue struck that down in 1920, effectively legalizing home winemaking. For beer, however, the 0.5% limit remained until 1933. Some vineyards embraced the sale of grapes for making wine at home. Zinfandel grapes were popular among home winemakers living near vineyards, but their tight bunches left their thin skins vulnerable to rot from rubbing and abrasion on the long journey to East Coast markets. The thick skins of Alicante Bouschet were less susceptible to rot, so that and similar varieties were widely planted for the home winemaking market.

The Act contained a number of exceptions and exemptions. Many of them were used to evade the law&#x27;s intended purpose. For example, the Act allowed a physician to prescribe whiskey for his patients but limited the amount that could be prescribed. Subsequently, the House of Delegates of the American Medical Association voted to submit to Congress a bill to remove the limit on the amount of whiskey that could be prescribed and questioned the ability of a legislature to determine the therapeutic value of any substance. Vine-Glo was produced ostensibly to let people make grape juice from concentrate but it included a warning on its packaging telling people how to make wine from it.

According to Neely, &quot;The Act called for trials for anyone charged with an alcohol-related offense, and juries often failed to convict. Under the state of New York&#x27;s Mullan–Gage Act, a short-lived local version of the Volstead Act, the first 4,000 arrests led to just six convictions and not one jail sentence&quot;.

While the production, transport and sale of intoxicating liquor was illegal, their purchase was ruled legal in &quot;United States v. Norris&quot;.

==Repeal==
Prohibition lost support because ignoring the law gained increasing social acceptance and organized crime violence increased. By 1933, public opposition to prohibition had become overwhelming. In March of that year, Congress passed the Cullen–Harrison Act, which legalized &quot;3.2 beer&quot; (i.e. beer containing 3.2% alcohol by weight or 4% by volume) and wines of similarly low alcohol content, rather than the 0.5% limit defined by the original Volstead Act.

In February 1933, Congress passed the Blaine Act, a proposed constitutional amendment to repeal the Eighteenth Amendment to end prohibition. On December 5, 1933, Utah became the 36th state to ratify the Twenty-first Amendment, which repealed the Eighteenth Amendment, voiding the Volstead Act and restoring control of alcohol to the states. All states either made alcohol legal, or passed control over alcohol production and consumption to the counties and provinces they comprise. That led to the creation of dry counties, most of which are in the South.

<text>In mathematics, mathematical physics and the theory of stochastic processes, a harmonic function is a twice continuously differentiable function formula_1 where is an open subset of that satisfies Laplace&#x27;s equation, that is,
formula_2
everywhere on . This is usually written as
formula_3
or
formula_4

==Etymology of the term &quot;harmonic&quot;==
The descriptor &quot;harmonic&quot; in the name harmonic function originates from a point on a taut string which is undergoing harmonic motion. The solution to the differential equation for this type of motion can be written in terms of sines and cosines, functions which are thus referred to as &quot;harmonics&quot;. Fourier analysis involves expanding functions on the unit circle in terms of a series of these harmonics. Considering higher dimensional analogues of the harmonics on the unit &quot;n&quot;-sphere, one arrives at the spherical harmonics. These functions satisfy Laplace&#x27;s equation and over time &quot;harmonic&quot; was used to refer to all functions satisfying Laplace&#x27;s equation.

== Examples ==
Examples of harmonic functions of two variables are:
* The real or imaginary part of any holomorphic function.
* The function formula_5 this is a special case of the example above, as formula_6 and formula_7 is a holomorphic function. The second derivative with respect to &quot;x&quot; is formula_8 while the second derivative with respect to &quot;y&quot; is formula_9
* The function formula_10 defined on formula_11 This can describe the electric potential due to a line charge or the gravity potential due to a long cylindrical mass.

Examples of harmonic functions of three variables are given in the table below with formula_12

Harmonic functions that arise in physics are determined by their singularities and boundary conditions (such as Dirichlet boundary conditions or Neumann boundary conditions). On regions without boundaries, adding the real or imaginary part of any entire function will produce a harmonic function with the same singularity, so in this case the harmonic function is not determined by its singularities; however, we can make the solution unique in physical situations by requiring that the solution approaches 0 as r approaches infinity. In this case, uniqueness follows by Liouville&#x27;s theorem.

The singular points of the harmonic functions above are expressed as &quot;charges&quot; and &quot;charge densities&quot; using the terminology of electrostatics, and so the corresponding harmonic function will be proportional to the electrostatic potential due to these charge distributions. Each function above will yield another harmonic function when multiplied by a constant, rotated, and/or has a constant added. The inversion of each function will yield another harmonic function which has singularities which are the images of the original singularities in a spherical &quot;mirror&quot;. Also, the sum of any two harmonic functions will yield another harmonic function.

Finally, examples of harmonic functions of variables are:

* The constant, linear and affine functions on all of (for example, the electric potential between the plates of a capacitor, and the gravity potential of a slab)
* The function formula_13 on formula_14 for .

== Properties ==

The set of harmonic functions on a given open set can be seen as the kernel of the Laplace operator and is therefore a vector space over linear combinations of harmonic functions are again harmonic.

If is a harmonic function on , then all partial derivatives of are also harmonic functions on . The Laplace operator and the partial derivative operator will commute on this class of functions.

In several ways, the harmonic functions are real analogues to holomorphic functions. All harmonic functions are analytic, that is, they can be locally expressed as power series. This is a general fact about elliptic operators, of which the Laplacian is a major example.

The uniform limit of a convergent sequence of harmonic functions is still harmonic. This is true because every continuous function satisfying the mean value property is harmonic. Consider the sequence on defined by formula_15 this sequence is harmonic and converges uniformly to the zero function; however note that the partial derivatives are not uniformly convergent to the zero function (the derivative of the zero function). This example shows the importance of relying on the mean value property and continuity to argue that the limit is harmonic.

== Connections with complex function theory ==
The real and imaginary part of any holomorphic function yield harmonic functions on (these are said to be a pair of harmonic conjugate functions). Conversely, any harmonic function on an open subset of is &quot;locally&quot; the real part of a holomorphic function. This is immediately seen observing that, writing formula_16 the complex function formula_17 is holomorphic in because it satisfies the Cauchy–Riemann equations. Therefore, locally has a primitive , and is the real part of up to a constant, as is the real part of formula_18

Although the above correspondence with holomorphic functions only holds for functions of two real variables, harmonic functions in variables still enjoy a number of properties typical of holomorphic functions. They are (real) analytic; they have a maximum principle and a mean-value principle; a theorem of removal of singularities as well as a Liouville theorem holds for them in analogy to the corresponding theorems in complex functions theory.

== Properties of harmonic functions ==
Some important properties of harmonic functions can be deduced from Laplace&#x27;s equation.

=== Regularity theorem for harmonic functions ===
Harmonic functions are infinitely differentiable in open sets. In fact, harmonic functions are real analytic.

=== Maximum principle ===
Harmonic functions satisfy the following &quot;maximum principle&quot;: if is a nonempty compact subset of , then restricted to attains its maximum and minimum on the boundary of . If is connected, this means that cannot have local maxima or minima, other than the exceptional case where is constant. Similar properties can be shown for subharmonic functions.

=== The mean value property ===
If is a ball with center and radius which is completely contained in the open set formula_19 then the value of a harmonic function formula_20 at the center of the ball is given by the average value of on the surface of the ball; this average value is also equal to the average value of in the interior of the ball. In other words,
formula_21
where is the volume of the unit ball in dimensions and is the -dimensional surface measure.

Conversely, all locally integrable functions satisfying the (volume) mean-value property are both infinitely differentiable and harmonic.

In terms of convolutions, if
formula_22
denotes the characteristic function of the ball with radius about the origin, normalized so that formula_23 the function is harmonic on if and only if
formula_24
as soon as formula_25

Sketch of the proof. The proof of the mean-value property of the harmonic functions and its converse follows immediately observing that the non-homogeneous equation, for any 
formula_26
admits an easy explicit solution of class with compact support in . Thus, if is harmonic in 
formula_27
holds in the set of all points in with formula_28

Since is continuous in , formula_29 converges to as showing the mean value property for in . Conversely, if is any formula_30 function satisfying the mean-value property in , that is,
formula_31
holds in for all then, iterating times the convolution with one has:
formula_32
so that is formula_33 because the -fold iterated convolution of is of class formula_34 with support . Since and are arbitrary, is formula_35 too. Moreover,
formula_36
for all so that in by the fundamental theorem of the calculus of variations, proving the equivalence between harmonicity and mean-value property.

This statement of the mean value property can be generalized as follows: If is any spherically symmetric function supported in such that formula_37 then formula_38 In other words, we can take the weighted average of about a point and recover . In particular, by taking to be a function, we can recover the value of at any point even if we only know how acts as a distribution. See Weyl&#x27;s lemma.

=== Harnack&#x27;s inequality ===
Let 
formula_39
be a connected set in a bounded domain .
Then for every non-negative harmonic function ,
Harnack&#x27;s inequality 
formula_40
holds for some constant that depends only on and .

=== Removal of singularities ===
The following principle of removal of singularities holds for harmonic functions. If is a harmonic function defined on a dotted open subset formula_41 of , which is less singular at than the fundamental solution (for ), that is
formula_42
then extends to a harmonic function on (compare Riemann&#x27;s theorem for functions of a complex variable).

=== Liouville&#x27;s theorem ===
Theorem: If is a harmonic function defined on all of which is bounded above or bounded below, then is constant.

(Compare Liouville&#x27;s theorem for functions of a complex variable).

Edward Nelson gave a particularly short proof of this theorem for the case of bounded functions, using the mean value property mentioned above: 
Given two points, choose two balls with the given points as centers and of equal radius. If the radius is large enough, the two balls will coincide except for an arbitrarily small proportion of their volume. Since is bounded, the averages of it over the two balls are arbitrarily close, and so assumes the same value at any two points. 
The proof can be adapted to the case where the harmonic function is merely bounded above or below. By adding a constant and possibly multiplying by –1, we may assume that is non-negative. Then for any two points and , and any positive number , we let formula_43 We then consider the balls and where by the triangle inequality, the first ball is contained in the second.

By the averaging property and the monotonicity of the integral, we have
formula_44
(Note that since is independent of , we denote it merely as .) In the last expression, we may multiply and divide by and use the averaging property again, to obtain
formula_45
But as formula_46 the quantity 
formula_47 
tends to 1. Thus, formula_48 The same argument with the roles of and reversed shows that formula_49, so that formula_50

Another proof uses the fact that given a Brownian motion in such that formula_51 we have formula_52 for all . In words, it says that a harmonic function defines a martingale for the Brownian motion. Then a probabilistic coupling argument finishes the proof.

==Generalizations==

===Weakly harmonic function===
A function (or, more generally, a distribution) is weakly harmonic if it satisfies Laplace&#x27;s equation
formula_53
in a weak sense (or, equivalently, in the sense of distributions). A weakly harmonic function coincides almost everywhere with a strongly harmonic function, and is in particular smooth. A weakly harmonic distribution is precisely the distribution associated to a strongly harmonic function, and so also is smooth. This is Weyl&#x27;s lemma.

There are other weak formulations of Laplace&#x27;s equation that are often useful. One of which is Dirichlet&#x27;s principle, representing harmonic functions in the Sobolev space as the minimizers of the Dirichlet energy integral
formula_54
with respect to local variations, that is, all functions formula_55 such that formula_56 holds for all formula_57 or equivalently, for all formula_58

===Harmonic functions on manifolds===
Harmonic functions can be defined on an arbitrary Riemannian manifold, using the Laplace–Beltrami operator . In this context, a function is called &quot;harmonic&quot; if 
formula_59
Many of the properties of harmonic functions on domains in Euclidean space carry over to this more general setting, including the mean value theorem (over geodesic balls), the maximum principle, and the Harnack inequality. With the exception of the mean value theorem, these are easy consequences of the corresponding results for general linear elliptic partial differential equations of the second order.

===Subharmonic functions===
A function that satisfies is called subharmonic. This condition guarantees that the maximum principle will hold, although other properties of harmonic functions may fail. More generally, a function is subharmonic if and only if, in the interior of any ball in its domain, its graph lies below that of the harmonic function interpolating its boundary values on the ball.

===Harmonic forms===
One generalization of the study of harmonic functions is the study of harmonic forms on Riemannian manifolds, and it is related to the study of cohomology. Also, it is possible to define harmonic vector-valued functions, or harmonic maps of two Riemannian manifolds, which are critical points of a generalized Dirichlet energy functional (this includes harmonic functions as a special case, a result known as Dirichlet principle). This kind of harmonic map appears in the theory of minimal surfaces. For example, a curve, that is, a map from an interval in to a Riemannian manifold, is a harmonic map if and only if it is a geodesic.

===Harmonic maps between manifolds===

If and are two Riemannian manifolds, then a harmonic map formula_60 is defined to be a critical point of the Dirichlet energy
formula_61
in which formula_62 is the differential of , and the norm is that induced by the metric on and that on on the tensor product bundle formula_63

Important special cases of harmonic maps between manifolds include minimal surfaces, which are precisely the harmonic immersions of a surface into three-dimensional Euclidean space. More generally, minimal submanifolds are harmonic immersions of one manifold in another. Harmonic coordinates are a harmonic diffeomorphism from a manifold to an open subset of a Euclidean space of the same dimension.
