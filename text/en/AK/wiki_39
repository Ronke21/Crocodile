<text>Taos () is a town in Taos County, in the north-central region of New Mexico in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. Initially founded in 1615, it was intermittently occupied until its formal establishment in 1795 by Nuevo México Governor Fernando Chacón to act as fortified plaza and trading outpost for the neighboring Native American Taos Pueblo (the town&#x27;s namesake) and Hispano communities, including Ranchos de Taos, Cañon, Taos Canyon, Ranchitos, El Prado, and Arroyo Seco. The town was incorporated in 1934. The 2021 estimate has a population of 6,567.

Taos is the county seat of Taos County. The English name &quot;Taos&quot; derives from the native Taos language meaning &quot;(place of) red willows&quot;.

==History==

===Taos Pueblo===

The Taos Pueblo, which borders the north boundary of the town of Taos, has been occupied for nearly a millennium. It is estimated that the pueblo was built between 1000 and 1450 A.D., with some later expansion, and the pueblo is considered to be one of the oldest continuously inhabited communities in the United States.

Located in a tributary valley off the Rio Grande, it is the most northern of the New Mexico pueblos. The pueblo, at some places five stories high, is a combination of many individual homes with common walls. There are over 1,900 Taos Puebloans living within the greater pueblo-area community. Many of them have modern homes near their fields and live there in the summer months, only staying at their homes within the main North or South pueblo buildings during cooler weather. About 150 people live within the main pueblo buildings year-round. The Taos Pueblo was added as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1992.

===Spanish colonization===

Taos was established c.1615 as &quot;Don Fernando de Taos&quot;, following the Spanish conquest of the Indian Pueblo villages. Initially, relations of the Spanish settlers with Taos Pueblo were amicable, but resentment of meddling by missionaries, and demands by &quot;encomenderos&quot; for tribute, led to a revolt in 1640; Taos Indians killed their priest and a number of Spanish settlers and subsequently fled the pueblo, not returning until 1661.

In 1680, Taos Pueblo joined the widespread Pueblo Revolt. After the Spanish Reconquest of 1692, Taos Pueblo continued armed resistance to the Spanish until 1696, when Governor Diego de Vargas defeated the Indians at Taos Canyon.

During the 1770s, Taos was repeatedly raided by Comanches who lived on the plains of what is now eastern Colorado. Juan Bautista de Anza, governor of the Province of New Mexico, led a successful punitive expedition in 1779 against the Comanches.

Between 1780 and 1800, Don Fernando de Taos (now simply Taos) was established. Between 1796 and 1797, the Don Fernando de Taos land grant gave land to 63 Spanish families in the Taos valley. It was built as a fortified plaza with adobe buildings and is now a central plaza surrounded by residential areas. Mountain men who trapped beaver nearby made Taos their home in the early 1800s.

===U.S. territory and statehood===
Mexico ceded the region to the U.S. in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848 after the Mexican–American War. After the U.S. takeover of New Mexico in 1847, Hispanics and American Indians in Taos staged a rebellion, known as the Taos Revolt, in which the newly appointed U.S. Governor, Charles Bent, was killed. New Mexico was a territory of the United States beginning in 1850 and became a state in 1912.

For historical reasons, the American flag is displayed continuously at Taos Plaza (both day and night). This derives from the time of the American Civil War, when Confederate sympathizers in the area attempted to remove the flag. The Union officer Kit Carson sought to discourage this activity by having guards surround the area and fly the flag 24 hours a day.

Anton Docher, the &quot;Padre of Isleta&quot;, first served as a priest in Taos before leaving for Isleta in 1891.

===Taos art colony===

Beginning in 1899, artists began to settle in Taos; six formed the Taos Society of Artists in 1915. In time, the Taos art colony developed. Many paintings were made of local scenes, especially of Taos Pueblo and activities there, as the artists often modelled Native Americans from the pueblo in their paintings. Some of the artists&#x27; studios have been preserved and may be viewed by visitors to Taos. These include the Ernest L. Blumenschein House, the Eanger Irving Couse House and Studio—Joseph Henry Sharp Studios, and the Nicolai Fechin house, all of which are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. A number of Foundations host artist residencies in Taos including the prestigious Helene Wurlitzer Foundation which began hosting painters, writer, composers, sculptors, poets and filmmakers at Casa Encantado in 1954.

<text>The Universal Esperanto Association (, UEA), also known as the World Esperanto Association, is the largest international organization of Esperanto speakers, with 5,501 individual members in 121 countries and 9,215 through national associations (in 2015) in 214 countries. In addition to individual members, 70 national Esperanto organizations are affiliated with UEA. Its current president is Prof. Duncan Charters. The magazine &quot;Esperanto&quot; is the main publication to inform UEA members about everything happening in the Esperanto community.

The UEA was founded in 1908 by the Swiss journalist Hector Hodler and others and is now headquartered in Rotterdam, Netherlands. The organization has official relations with the United Nations and has an office at the United Nations headquarters in New York City.

== Structure and affiliated organizations ==
According to its 1980 statutes (Statuto de UEA), the Universal Esperanto Association has two kinds of members:
* individual members join the association directly, paying a fee to the Rotterdam headquarters or to the chief delegate in their country. These members receive UEA services.
* &quot;&quot; (associate members), i.e., members of organizations that joined UEA. These members are administered by their respective organizations, which can be national or specialist bodies. This kind of indirect membership is, for the individual person, more symbolic than direct membership.

The UEA&#x27;s supervisory board, the &quot;Komitato&quot;, has members (&quot;komitatanoj&quot;) elected in three different ways:
* An organization sends at least one &quot;komitatano,&quot; plus one more for every 1,000 national members, to the Komitato. Most national organizations have only one &quot;komitatano&quot;.
* For every 1,000 individual members, one member can be chosen to the Komitato.
* Both previous groups may together elect additional &quot;komitatanoj&quot;, up to one-third of their numbers.

The &quot;Komitato&quot; serves as a sort of parliament and elects a board, the &quot;Estraro&quot;. The &quot;Estraro&quot; installs a general director and sometimes a director as well. The general director and staff work at the UEA headquarters, &quot;Oficejo de UEA&quot;, in Rotterdam.

Individual members can become a &quot;delegito&quot;, a &#x27;delegate&#x27;, who serves as a local contact person for Esperanto and UEA members in their town. A &quot;ĉefdelegito&quot; (chief delegate) is someone installed also by the UEA headquarters, but with the task to collect and remit membership fees in a given country.

=== Youth section ===
TEJO, the World Esperanto Youth Organization, is the youth section of the UEA. Similar to the World Congress, TEJO organizes an International Youth Congress of Esperanto (&quot;Internacia Junulara Kongreso&quot;) each year in a different location. The IJK is a week-long event of concerts, presentations, excursions attended by hundreds of young people from all over the world.

The youth section has a &quot;Komitato&quot; and national and specialist affiliated organizations, just as the UEA itself. A TEJO volunteer works at the Rotterdam headquarters.

=== National organizations ===
The first national Esperanto organization was founded in 1898 in France, originally as a potential international association. In 1903 the second one followed, in Switzerland. Within a couple of years, many of the still existing national organizations came into existence. Since 1933-1934 they have sent representatives to the UEA &quot;Komitato&quot;, making it a federation of national organizations. In Esperanto these were initially termed as &quot;Naciaj Societoj&quot; (national societies), but they have subsequently become known as &quot;Landaj Asocioj&quot; (country associations).

When UEA accepted national organizations in 1933-1934 for the first time, it required them to
* have at least 100 national members,
* be &#x27;organized in an orderly manner&#x27;,
* be neutral, meaning having no political or religious aims, and being open to all citizens of the country.

Especially the last prerequisite caused serious problems, e.g. to the German national association submitting to Nazi Party rule. Decades later, in 1959, the Cuban association was refused because its statutes respected the leading role of the Communist Party of Cuba. In 1980, the UEA statutes were altered to specify that while a national organization need not be neutral itself, it must respect the neutrality of UEA.

=== Specialist organizations ===
Specialist organizations are similar to the national organizations. They are divided into two groups:
* neutral organizations, which can join UEA in the same way as national organizations. In Esperanto they are called &quot;aliĝintaj fakaj asocioj&quot; (affiliated specialist associations). Examples are the Esperanto physicians and the Esperanto teachers.
* other organizations in (official) collaboration with UEA. They do not send representatives to the Komitato but can have a room at the World Congress. Examples are Esperantist vegetarians, Esperantist Catholics and Esperantist communists. Some of them choose not to be affiliated because of financial reasons; others are non-neutral and therefore cannot join UEA.

The youth section TEJO has two affiliated specialist groups, the Esperantist cyclists and Esperantist rock music fans.

== Activities ==
=== Publications ===
UEA publishes &quot;Esperanto&quot;, the most important Esperanto periodical. It was started in 1905 by Paul Berthelot, three years before UEA was founded. UEA founder Hector Hodler took it over in 1907 and made it the official UEA magazine in 1908. In 1920 he left the magazine to the association. Since the 1950s it has had a paid editor-in-chief. Next to &quot;Esperanto&quot;, the &quot;Yearbook&quot; (&quot;Jarlibro de UEA&quot;) which published for 108 years, was the oldest continuous publication of the association.

UEA publishes books and has the largest mail-order Esperanto bookstore in the world (with over 6,000 book titles, CDs and other items). It also maintains an information centre and an important Esperanto library, called the Hector Hodler Library. The organisation has a network of local representatives from around the world, the &quot;Delegita Reto&quot;, who are available to provide information about their geographical area or professional field.

=== Conventions ===
The yearly World Esperanto Congress (&quot;Universala Kongreso de Esperanto&quot;), which attracts 1,500–3,000 people to a different city each year, is held under the direction of UEA. The first congress took place in 1905, and since 1933–1934 the UEA has had responsibility for the annual event. Since 2009, World Congresses have been held in Białystok, Poland, the hometown of L. L. Zamenhof, the creator and guiding spirit of Esperanto, as well as in Havana, Copenhagen, Hanoi, Reykjavík, Buenos Aires, Lille, Nitra, Seoul, Lisbon, Lahti, Montreal and Turin. In 2020 and 2021 the Congresses were held virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Congresses are scheduled for Arusha, Tanzania in 2024 and Brno, Czech Republic in 2025.

Twice a year, in spring and autumn, UEA headquarters in Rotterdam holds an Open Day.

=== International organizations ===
In addition to the UN and UNESCO, UEA also has consultative relations with UNICEF and the Council of Europe, and a general working relationship with the Organization of American States. It works in an official capacity with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) as an A-liaison to ISO/TC37. UEA is active in public information in the European Union and, as necessary, at other interstate and international organizations and conferences. The organisation is a member of the European Language Council, a common forum of universities and language associations for the awareness of languages and cultures inside and outside the European Union.

In May 2011, UEA officially became an Associate Member of the International Information Centre for Terminology (Infoterm).

=== Grabowski Prize ===
The Grabowski Prize is a prize awarded to young authors writing in Esperanto by the Antoni Grabowski Foundation, part of the Universal Esperanto Association (UEA). It is named after Antoni Grabowski, who has been called &quot;the father of Esperanto poetry&quot;. The awards for the first three winners are $700, $300 and $150 respectively.

==== Past recipients ====
Ulrich Becker, a publisher of literature in and about Esperanto and of interlinguistic literature in general, was awarded the Grabowski Prize (Premio Grabowski) in 2005 for his achievements in publishing in Esperanto. Among other works, he is the publisher of the thrice-yearly periodical of Esperanto belles-lettres, &quot;Beletra Almanako&quot;.

== History ==
=== The founding years of the Esperanto movement, 1888–1914 ===
The modern UEA is the result of a decades-long process of several attempts to give the Esperanto movement a sound foundation. The first Esperanto associations were local clubs, of which the one in Nuremberg, Germany, is considered the first (1888). From 1898, national Esperanto associations were found in several countries, with the French one being the first. In 1903 followed the Swiss association; then in 1904 the British, in 1906 the German and Swedish, etc.

The founder of Esperanto, L. L. Zamenhof, wished for an international association to come into existence, but the first world congress of 1905 produced only a general manifesto about the essence and neutrality of the movement. The organizing team passed the torch to organizers of a next congress the year after, which eventually created a &quot;Konstanta Kongresa Komitato&quot; (Permanent Congress Committee). It consisted of two members representing the previous congress, two for the current one, and two for the next following congress.

Esperantists agreed that the whole movement must support two common international tasks: international documentation, propaganda in countries without movements of their own, lobbying at international organizations, organizing the world congresses, etc. Esperantists did disagree on which or what organization should be responsible for these tasks, how it should collect the money and how it should decide on spending the money.

In 1906, the French Gen. Hyppolyte Sebert created his &quot;Esperantista Centra Oficejo&quot; (Central Office of the Esperantists) in Paris. It collected information on the movement and published an &quot;Oficiala Gazeto&quot;. In spite of this &#x27;official&#x27; name, the office was a purely private enterprise of Sebert, but he tried to engender support from the various national associations.

One year later, at the Geneva world congress, Zamenhof created a &quot;Lingva Komitato&quot; (Language Committee), the basis of the later Akademio de Esperanto. It consisted of some eminent speakers from several countries and was intended to safeguard the evolution of the Esperanto language; members were elected for a nine-year term.

In 1908, a group of young Esperanto speakers founded an international association based on individual, direct membership: &quot;Universala Esperanto-Asocio&quot;, based in Geneva. According to Hector Hodler and his followers, an international cause such as Esperanto must be supported by a unitary, truly international association, and UEA members should found separate organizations on national and local levels.

The national (and local) associations initially saw the UEA not as a supporting resource but as a threat, as undesirable competition. They were afraid of a division in the movement between the traditional groups on the one hand and the UEA members on the other. Also, propaganda and lessons were the task of the national associations (often federations of local groups). They did not like the perspective that new Esperantists, created by the traditional groups, would be picked up by UEA.

The national associations then tried to build up an international organizational level of their own. A first attempt took the form of &quot;rajtigitaj delegitoj&quot; to the congresses in 1911 and 1912 (not to be confused with the UEA &quot;delegitoj&quot;); an &quot;Internacia Unuiĝo de Esperantistaj Societoj&quot; (International Union of Esperanto associations, 1913-1914) was a second attempt. This evolutionary thread ceased in 1914 with the breakout of World War I, which forced the movement as a whole to pause many of its activities, and the Congresses planned for 1916, 1917, 1918 and 1919 were cancelled.

=== UEA in its first years ===
The original UEA was purely based on individual membership. The members in a given locality, e.g. a town, were supposed to have UEA member conventions and elect a &quot;delegito&quot; (plural &quot;delegitoj&quot;), a delegate. The delegate was tasked with collecting membership fees and sending them to the Geneva headquarters, and was expected to represent the other local members on the international level. The totality of delegates held referendums, and they elected the &quot;Komitato.&quot;

The Komitato board initially had eight (since 1910: ten) members, with a president and a vice-president. One of the board members served as director; from 1908 to 1920 this was Hector Hodler. The director installed delegates in towns with fewer than 20 members. These were 94 percent of the delegates, so the UEA was not so much a democracy but a circular, self-renewing system of cooptation. (Since 1920, the &quot;Komitato&quot; was enlarged, becoming a kind of parliament, and a board with the name &quot;Estraro&quot; was established.)

Hodler was still the owner and publisher of his magazine &quot;Esperanto&quot;, published every second week. From the beginning, UEA had a Yearbook — &quot;Jarlibro&quot; — with basic information about the association and with the addresses of the delegates.

Esperanto speakers are divided by different subjects they are interested in. In those early years, some specialist organizations developed — for example, the &quot;Universala Medicina Esperanto-Asocio&quot; of 1908. Hodler tried to give those &#x27;specialists&#x27; a home in the UEA. Instead of founding specialized associations of their own, with separate bulletins and conventions, he wanted them to be UEA members and have &#x27;fakoj&#x27; (compartments). He also thought of partner organizations — for example, hotels which would give a discount to UEA members in exchange for an advertisement in the UEA Yearbook.

Hodler projected an organization fit to contain tens or hundreds of thousands of members, the so-called &quot;esperantianoj&quot; (UEA members, in opposition to the simple &quot;esperantistoj&quot;, Esperanto speakers). In fact, UEA never exceeded a membership of 10,000. The association adopted several new statutes until 1920.

=== Attempts at organization in the interbellum, 1920–1933 ===

In 1920, the Esperanto movement gathered again for the first time since the war, at The Hague congress. The discussions eventually created the so-called Helsinki system, on which UEA and the national associations agreed at the congress of 1922 in the Finnish capital. This system defined the movement to consist of these &#x27;official&#x27; entities:
* &quot;Universala Esperanto Asocio&quot; (UEA), the international members&#x27; association in Geneva; it paid contributions to a common budget
* &quot;Konstanta Komitato de la Naciaj Societoj&quot; (&quot;Ko-Ro&quot;, Permanent Committee of the National Associations), a newly created body to represent the national associations; it collected contributions from the national associations for the common budget
* &quot;Internacia Centra Komitato de la Esperanto-Movado&quot; (&quot;ICK&quot;, International Central Committee of the Esperanto Movement), a newly created six-member body elected by UEA and &quot;Ko-Ro&quot; together; administering the common budget and doing the operational business for common international tasks, also representing the movement as a whole. It had a paid secretary.
* the congress committee, administered and subsidized by the &quot;ICK&quot;
* the language committee (later the Academy of Esperanto), subsidized by the &quot;ICK&quot;

This Helsinki system lasted for only a couple of years. The heads of the movement saw that at the world congresses there was considerable overlap, and three separate groups were discussing essentially the same subjects: the &quot;Komitato&quot; of UEA, the &quot;Ko-Ro&quot; of the national associations and the six members of the &quot;ICK.&quot; From 1929, they all had a joint gathering called &quot;Ĝenerala Estraro&quot; (general board). A number of proposals came up in the movement to reform the organization.

The final blow to the Helsinki system came in 1932 when UEA did not pay its contributions for the common budget, and the same was true for some of the national associations. The British, German and French associations, the largest ones, took up the initiative to found a new organization, &quot;Universala Federacio Esperantista&quot; (World Federation of Esperantists), as a federation of national associations. This new organization had scarcely come into existence when in early 1933 the UEA and the national organizations agreed on a complete reform of the movement.

=== The &#x27;new UEA&#x27; and the schism of 1936 ===
In 1933, at the Cologne congress, UEA and the national organizations made UEA the common or umbrella organization of the international Esperanto movement. In 1934 the UEA members accepted new UEA statutes. The &#x27;new UEA&#x27;, as it was called, was (and still is) a federation of national associations but also of individual members directly administered by UEA.

The highest organ of UEA was the Komitato. It gathered representatives from the national organizations; the numbers depended on the size of the national organization. Other representatives were elected by the delegates, depending on the number of delegates. A third group of representatives was elected by the two first groups; this opened the possibility to include &#x27;experts&#x27; who were not linked to a national organization or popular among the delegates. Since 1947, one speaks of the &quot;komitatanoj A&quot; (from the national organizations), the &quot;komitatanoj B&quot; (from the delegates, later members) and the &quot;komitatanoj C&quot; (those indirectly elected).

As the representatives of the national organizations by far outnumbered the others, it is right to call UEA in essence a federation. But all officeholders of UEA had to be individual members, and the core services of the association, such as the Yearbook, were still reserved to individual members.

UEA since then is the legal heir of the former Helsinki organizations, such as the International Central Committee. The association since then also organizes the annual World Congress of Esperanto.

Although in 1933-1934 it first seemed that the transition could happen in harmony, at the 1934 congress in Stockholm some UEA functionaries were not re-elected. In anger, UEA president Eduard Stettler and others resigned. The new board with president Louis Bastien faced a catastrophic financial situation and decided in early 1936 to depart Geneva for London. In London, the capable activist Cecil C. Goldsmith wanted to become the new director (secretary), and for certain currency reasons UEA could exist significantly more cheaply in Britain than in Switzerland.

A hastily organized and secret campaign, led by former president Stettler, made it impossible for the Bastien-led board to legally move the headquarters away from Switzerland. After several months of discussions and a referendum, the Bastien board members and the Komitato members left the UEA altogether and established, in September 1936, a new association, the &quot;Internacia Esperanto-Ligo&quot; (IEL). Nearly all national organizations and individual members followed. In Geneva there remained a near-deserted shell of the UEA, in which the old leaders once again took power, the so-called Genevan UEA.

=== UEA after World War II ===
The international Esperanto movement survived World War II with its IEL headquarters in Heronsgate, near London. Hans Jakob, from the Genevan UEA, tricked the IEL board into a merger of IEL and the rump Genevan UEA, falsely stating that the wealthy Eduard Stettler had left a huge sum to the UEA.

Ivo Lapenna, a London law professor originally coming from Croatia, in the 1950s reshaped the association significantly. The office moved from Heronsgate to Rotterdam, the board since then has a &quot;general secretary&quot;, the &quot;Esperanto&quot; editor is a paid position. After 1956, the association in 1980 was again (and since then for the last time) given new statutes.

In the decades after the war, the staff grew. Before the war, it was common to have a director with only one or two assistants. After the war, the UEA at times employed ten or more people (e.g. a congress manager, a book seller, a librarian.)

Lapenna introduced a &quot;prestige policy&quot;, for which he was willing to spend considerable funds. This included signature campaigns for Esperanto and efforts to make UNESCO support Esperanto in a moral way, which Lapenna accomplished in 1954 at the UNESCO conference in Montevideo, Uruguay. This made him famous in Esperanto circles as the &quot;hero of Montevideo&quot;. After having served for more than 30 years on the board of UEA, Lapenna left the association in 1974 and created a rival organization (&quot;Neŭtrala Esperanto-Movado&quot;).

During the Cold War, UEA had to deal with the difficulty of having national organizations and individual members in communist countries. Additionally, the work of Esperanto organizations in Western countries was sometimes influenced by the Cold War: In the early 50s, the American Esperanto leader George Allan Connor denounced dissenting members of his national organization as communists. His national organization and he as an individual were eventually thrown out of UEA. The collapse of the Soviet Union and its allied states between 1989 and 1991 completely changed the international situation.

<text>Juan Bautista de Anza Bezerra Nieto (July 6 or 7, 1736 – December 19, 1788) was an expeditionary leader, military officer, and politician primarily in California and New Mexico under the Spanish Empire. He is credited as one of the founding fathers of Spanish California and served as an official within New Spain as Governor of the province of New Mexico.

==Early life==

Juan Bautista de Anza Bezerra Nieto was born in Fronteras, New Navarre, New Spain (today Sonora, Mexico) in 1736 (near Arizpe), most probably at Cuquiarachi, Sonora, but possibly at the Presidio of Fronteras.

His family was a part of the military leadership in Nueva España, as his father and maternal grandfather, Captain Antonio Bezerra Nieto, had both served Spain, their families living on the frontier of Nueva Navarra. He was the son of Juan Bautista de Anza I. It is traditionally thought that he may have been educated at the College of San Ildefonso in Mexico City, and later at the military academy there. In 1752 he enlisted in the army at the Presidio of Fronteras. He advanced rapidly and had become a captain by 1760. He married in 1761. His wife was Ana María Pérez Serrano (b. January 1744/45, d. date unknown), the daughter of Spanish mine owner Francisco Pérez Serrano. They had no children. His military duties mainly consisted of hostile forays against Native Americans, such as the Apache, during the course of which he explored much of what is now Arizona.

==California expeditions==

The Spanish began colonizing Alta California with the Portolá expedition of 1769–1770. The two-pronged Portolá effort involved both a long sea voyage against prevailing winds and the California Current, and a difficult land route from Baja California. Colonies were established at San Diego and Monterey, with a presidio and Franciscan mission at each location. A more direct land route and further colonization were desired, especially at present-day San Francisco, which Portolá saw but was not able to colonize. By the time of Juan Bautista de Anza&#x27;s expedition, three more missions had been established, including Mission San Antonio de Padua in the Salinas Valley.

In 1772, Anza proposed an expedition to Alta California to the Viceroy of New Spain. This was approved by the King of Spain and on January 8, 1774, with 3 padres, 20 soldiers, 11 servants, 35 mules, 65 cattle, and 140 horses, Anza set forth from Tubac Presidio, south of present-day Tucson, Arizona. Anza heard of a California Native American called Sebastian Tarabal who had fled from Mission San Gabriel to Sonora, and took him as guide. The expedition took a southern route along the Rio Altar (Sonora y Sinaloa, New Spain), then paralleled the present-day Mexico–California border, crossing the Colorado River at its confluence with the Gila River. This was in the domain of the Yuma tribe, with which he established good relations.

Anza reached Mission San Gabriel Arcángel, near the California coast, on March 22, 1774, and Monterey, California, Alta California&#x27;s future capital (Alta California split from Las Californias 1804, creating Baja and Alta), on April 19. He returned to Tubac by late May 1774. This expedition was closely watched by Viceroy and King, and on October 2, 1774, Anza was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-colonel, and ordered to lead a group of colonists to Alta California. The Spanish were desirous of reinforcing their presence in Alta California as a buffer against Russian colonization of the Americas advancing from the north, and possibly establish a harbor that would give shelter to Spanish ships. The expedition got under way on October 23, 1775, and arrived at Mission San Gabriel Arcángel in January 1776, the colonists having suffered greatly from the winter weather en route.

The expedition continued on to Monterey with the colonists. Having fulfilled his mission from the Viceroy, he continued north with the priest Pedro Font and a party of twelve others, following an inland route to the San Francisco Bay established in 1770 by Pedro Fages. On the way, he led a raid on Apache settlements near Presidio San Ignacio de Tubac, capturing forty Apaches. The soldiers divided the captives among them as slaves; Anza kept the fifteen female captives and their newborns as his share.

In Anza&#x27;s diary on March 25, 1776, he states that he &quot;arrived at the arroyo of San Joseph Cupertino (now Stevens Creek), which is useful only for travelers. Here we halted for the night, having come eight leagues in seven and a half hours. From this place we have seen at our right the estuary which runs from the port of San Francisco.&quot; Pressing on, Anza located the sites for the Presidio of San Francisco and Mission San Francisco de Asis in present-day San Francisco, California on March 28, 1776. He did not establish the settlement; it was established later by José Joaquín Moraga. While returning to Monterey, he located the original sites for Mission Santa Clara de Asis and the town of San José de Guadalupe (present-day San Jose, California), but again did not establish either settlement. Today this route is marked as the Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail.

Despite DeAnza&#x27;s successes, Spanish ambitions to establish a permanent overland route from Sonora to Alta California were thwarted in 1781, when a revolt of the Yumas tribe closed the trail at the Yuma Crossing of the Colorado River. The route was not reopened until the late 1820s, and the only regular travel to Alta California during the intervening years was by sea.

==Governor of New Mexico==

On his return from this successful expedition in 1777 he journeyed to Mexico City with the chief of the lower Colorado River area Quechan (Yuma) Native American tribe who requested the establishment of a mission. On August 24, 1777, the Viceroy of New Spain appointed Anza as the Governor of the Province of Nuevo México, the present-day U.S. state of New Mexico.

Governor Anza led a punitive expedition against the Comanche group of Native Americans, who had been repeatedly raiding Taos during 1779. With his Ute and Apache Native American allies, and around 800 Spanish soldiers, Anza went north through the San Luis Valley, entering the Great Plains at what is now Manitou Springs, Colorado. Circling &quot;El Capitan&quot; (current day Pikes Peak), he surprised a small force of the Comanche near present-day Colorado Springs. Pursuing them south down Fountain Creek, he crossed the Arkansas River near present-day Pueblo, Colorado. He found the main body of the Comanche on Greenhorn Creek, returning from a raid in Nuevo México, and won a decisive victory. Chief Cuerno Verde, for whom Greenhorn Creek is named, and many other leaders of the Comanche were killed.

In late 1779, Anza and his party found a route from Santa Fe to Sonora, west of the El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro. His various local military expeditions against tribes defending their homelands were often successful, but the Quechan (Yuma) Native American tribe which he had established peace with earlier rebelled, and he fell out of favor with the military commander of the Northern Frontier, the frontier-general. In 1783 Anza led a campaign against the Comanche on the eastern plains and by 1784 they were suing for peace. The last of the Comanche chiefs eventually acceded and a formal treaty was concluded on 28 February 1786 at Pecos Pueblo. This paved the way for traders and the development of the Comanchero trade.

Juan Bautista de Anza remained as governor of Nuevo Mexico (New Mexico) until 1787 when he returned to Sonora. He was appointed commander of the Presidio of Tucson in 1788 but died before he could depart and take office. He was 52 years old. Anza was survived by his wife.

Juan Bautista de Anza died in Arizpe, in what is now the State of Sonora, Mexico, and was buried in the &quot;Church of Nuestra Señora de la Asunción de Arizpe&quot;. In 1963, with the participation of delegations from the University of California, Berkeley and San Francisco, he was disinterred and reburied in a new marble memorial mausoleum at the same Church.

The primary legacy is the Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail in California and Arizona, administered by the US National Park Service, for hiking and driving the route of his expedition exploring Las Californias In the San Fernando Valley the trail crosses the Upper Las Virgenes Canyon Open Space Preserve, and in the San Gabriel Valley the trail is in the Puente Hills just north of Whittier, California.

Also named for Anza is Anza-Borrego Desert State Park, located mostly in eastern San Diego County, California. The park contains a long and difficult stretch of the Anza trail, traveling west from the Imperial Valley to the coastal mountain passes northeast of San Diego. The de Anza Country Club and its 18-hole championship Golf course is located within the village of Borrego Springs, California, which is entirely surrounded by the park.

A building named the Juan de Anza House in San Juan Bautista, California is a National Historic Landmark. However, it was constructed c. 1830 with its connection unclear. The Juan Bautista de Anza Community Park is in Calabasas, California, and De Anza Park and the De Anza Community and Teen Center are in Ontario, California.

A statue of Anza, sculpted in 1939, is located in Riverside, California at the corner of Magnolia Ave. and 14th Street, and another statue stands in Lake Merced park, San Francisco. A portrait of de Anza by Albert Herter in 1929 hangs in the History Room of the Los Angeles Central Library.

The de Anza and De Anza spellings are also the namesake of streets, schools, and buildings in his honor including: De Anza Boulevards in San Mateo and Cupertino, De Anza Park in Sunnyvale, De Anza College in Cupertino, De Anza High School in Richmond, Juan Bautista De Anza elementary school in San Jacinto, Juan De Anza K-5 in the Wiseburn Elementary School District of Hawthorne, De Anza Middle School in Ontario, De Anza Middle School in Ventura, De Anza Elementary School in El Centro, and the De Anza School in Baldwin Park, the landmark De Anza Hotel in San Jose, and the historic De Anza Hotel in Calexico—all in California.

Using just Anza in his honor are: Anza Vista Avenue within the Anza Vista neighborhood of San Francisco, Anza Street in that city&#x27;s Richmond District, Lake Anza in Tilden Regional Park above Berkeley in the Berkeley Hills, and Anza Avenue and Anza Elementary School in Torrance. The town of Anza, California, is a small town of 7,000 people on State Route 371 in the mountains south of Palm Springs.

Also named in his honor is Juan Bautista Circle in the Parkmerced development in San Francisco.

<text>In mass communication, digital media is any communication media that operates in conjunction with various encoded machine-readable data formats. Digital content can be created, viewed, distributed, modified, listened to, and preserved on a digital electronic device, including digital data storage media (in contrast to analog electronic media) and digital broadcasting. &quot;Digital&quot; is defined as any data represented by a series of digits, and &quot;media&quot; refers to methods of broadcasting or communicating this information. Together, &quot;digital media&quot; refers to mediums of digitized information broadcast through a screen and/or a speaker. This also includes text, audio, video, and graphics that are transmitted over the internet for viewing or listening to on the internet.

Digital media platforms, such as YouTube, Kick, and Twitch, accounted for viewership rates of 27.9 billion hours in 2020. A contributing factor to its part in what is commonly referred to as &quot;the digital revolution&quot; can be attributed to the use of interconnectivity.

==Examples==
Examples of digital media include software, digital images, digital video, video games, web pages and websites, social media, digital data and databases, digital audio such as MP3, electronic documents and electronic books. Digital media often contrasts with print media, such as printed books, newspapers and magazines, and other traditional or analog media, such as photographic film, audio tapes or video tapes.

Digital media has had a significantly broad and complex impact on society and culture. Combined with the Internet and personal computing, digital media has caused disruptive innovation in publishing, journalism, public relations, entertainment, education, commerce and politics. Digital media has also posed new challenges to copyright and intellectual property laws, fostering an open content movement in which content creators voluntarily give up some or all of their legal rights to their work. The ubiquity of digital media and its effects on society suggest that we are at the start of a new era in industrial history, called the Information Age, perhaps leading to a paperless society in which all media are produced and consumed on computers. However, challenges to a digital transition remain, including outdated copyright laws, censorship, the digital divide, and the spectre of a digital dark age, in which older media becomes inaccessible to new or upgraded information systems. Digital media has a significant, wide-ranging and complex impact on society and culture.

==Business model==
Digital media platforms like YouTube work through a triple-product business model in which platforms provide information and entertainment (infotainment) to the public often at no cost, while simultaneously capturing their attention, and also collecting user data to sell to advertisers. This business model aims to maximize consumer engagement on the platform. 
;Paid Media

Paid media refers to promotional channels that marketers pay to use, including traditional media (e.g., television, radio, print, or outdoor advertising), online and digital media (e.g., paid search ads, web and social media display ads, mobile ads, or email marketing). This model compels businesses to develop sponsored media then pay social media platforms like Instagram for the right to show such media to customers in the platforms&#x27; newsfeeds. These customers become exposed to paid media, sometimes referred to as promoted or sponsored posts.

;Owned Media

Owned media refers to digital assets and channels that a company or individual controls and manages. This includes websites, social media profiles for example Facebook etc., blogs, and any other content platforms own and operated by the entity. Entity means the owner or controller of the channel such as business or person managing their online presence

;Earned Media

Earned media denotes public relations media channels like television, newspapers, blogs, or video sites that do not require direct payment or control by marketers but are included because viewers, readers, or users are interested in them. Free media is essentially online word of mouth, typically in &quot;viral&quot; trends, mentions, shares, retweets, reviews, recommendations, or content from third-party websites. When one&#x27;s product or service is so good that users cannot help but post it on their social media, they get a lot of &quot;earned media&quot;. They win the credibility of the media compared to other forms of credibility, becoming more transparent.

==History==
Codes and information by machines were first conceptualized by Charles Babbage in the early 1800s. Babbage imagined that these codes would give him instructions for his Motor of Difference and Analytical Engine, machines that Babbage had designed to solve the problem of error in calculations. Between 1822 and 1823, the mathematician Ada Lovelace wrote the first instructions for calculating numbers on Babbage engines. Lovelace&#x27;s instructions are now believed to be the first computer program. Although the machines were designed to perform analysis tasks, Lovelace anticipated the possible social impact of computers and program writing. &quot;For in the distribution and combination of truths and formulas of analysis, which may become easier and more quickly subjected to the mechanical combinations of the engine, the relationships and the nature of many subjects in which science necessarily relates in new subjects, and more deeply researched […] there are in all extensions of human power or additions to human knowledge, various collateral influences, in addition to the primary and primary object reached.&quot; Other old machine readable media include instructions for pianolas and weaving machines.
It is estimated that in the year 1986 less than 1% of the world&#x27;s media storage capacity was digital and in 2007 it was already 94%. The year 2002 is assumed to be the year when human kind was able to store more information in digital than in analog media (the &quot;beginning of the digital age&quot;).

===Digital computers===

Though they used machine-readable media, Babbage&#x27;s engines, player pianos, jacquard looms and many other early calculating machines were themselves analog computers, with physical, mechanical parts. The first truly digital media came into existence with the rise of digital computers. Digital computers use binary code and Boolean logic to store and process information, allowing one machine in one configuration to perform many different tasks. The first modern, programmable, digital computers, the Manchester Mark 1 and the EDSAC, were independently invented between 1948 and 1949. Though different in many ways from modern computers, these machines had digital software controlling their logical operations. They were encoded in binary, a system of ones and zeroes that are combined to make hundreds of characters. The 1s and 0s of binary are the &quot;digits&quot; of digital media.

===&quot;As We May Think&quot;===
While digital media did not come into common use until the late 20th century, the &quot;conceptual&quot; foundation of digital media is traced to the work of scientist and engineer Vannevar Bush and his celebrated essay &quot;As We May Think&quot;, published in &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; in 1945. Bush envisioned a system of devices that could be used to help scientists, doctors, and historians, among others, to store, analyze and communicate information. Calling this then-imaginary device a &quot;memex&quot;, Bush wrote:
The owner of the memex, let us say, is interested in the origin and properties of the bow and arrow. Specifically, he is studying why the short Turkish bow was apparently superior to the English long bow in the skirmishes of the Crusades. He has dozens of possibly pertinent books and articles in his memex. First, he runs through an encyclopedia, finds an interesting but sketchy article, and leaves it projected. Next, in history, he finds another pertinent item and ties the two together. Thus he goes, building a trail of many items. Occasionally he inserts a comment of his own, either linking it into the main trail or joining it by a side trail to a particular item. When it becomes evident that the elastic properties of available materials had a great deal to do with the bow, he branches off on a side trail which takes him through textbooks on elasticity and tables of physical constants. He inserts a page of longhand analysis of his own. Thus he builds a trail of his interest through the maze of materials available to him.
Bush hoped that the creation of this memex would be the work of scientists after World War II. Though the essay predated digital computers by several years, &quot;As We May Think&quot; anticipated the potential social and intellectual benefits of digital media and provided the conceptual framework for digital scholarship, the World Wide Web, wikis and even social media. It was recognized as a significant work even at the time of its publication.

==Impact==

=== The digital revolution ===
Since the 1960s, computing power and storage capacity have increased exponentially, largely as a result of MOSFET scaling which enables MOS transistor counts to increase at a rapid pace predicted by Moore&#x27;s law. Personal computers and smartphones put the ability to access, modify, store and share digital media in the hands of billions of people. Many electronic devices, from digital cameras to drones have the ability to create, transmit and view digital media. Combined with the World Wide Web and the Internet, digital media has transformed 21st century society in a way that is frequently compared to the cultural, economic and social impact of the printing press. The change has been so rapid and so widespread that it has launched an economic transition from an industrial economy to an information-based economy, creating a new period in human history known as the Information Age or the digital revolution.

The transition has created some uncertainty about definitions. Digital media, new media, multimedia, and similar terms all have a relationship to both the engineering innovations and cultural impact of digital media. The blending of digital media with other media, and with cultural and social factors, is sometimes known as new media or &quot;the new media.&quot; Similarly, digital media seems to demand a new set of communications skills, called transliteracy, media literacy, or digital literacy. These skills include not only the ability to read and write—traditional literacy—but the ability to navigate the Internet, evaluate sources, and create digital content. The idea that we are moving toward a fully digital, paperless society is accompanied by the fear that we may soon—or currently—be facing a digital dark age, in which older media are no longer accessible on modern devices or using modern methods of scholarship. Digital media has a significant, wide-ranging and complex effect on society and culture.

A senior engineer at Motorola named Martin Cooper was the first person to make a phone call on April 3, 1973. He decided the first phone call should be to a rival telecommunications company saying &quot;I&#x27;m speaking via a mobile phone&quot;. Ten years later, Motorola released the Motorola DynaTAC, the first commercially available mobile phone. In the early 1990s Nokia released the Nokia 1011, the first mass-produced mobile phone. The number of smartphone users has increased dramatically, as has the commercial landscape. While Android and iOS both dominate the smartphone market. A study By Gartner found that in 2016 about 88% of the worldwide smartphones were Android while iOS had a market share of about 12%. About 85% of the mobile market revenue came from mobile games.

The impact of the digital revolution can also be assessed by exploring the amount of worldwide mobile smart device users there are. This can be split into 2 categories; smart phone users and smart tablet users. Worldwide there are currently 2.32 billion smartphone users across the world. This figure is to exceed 2.87 billion by 2020. Smart tablet users reached a total of 1 billion in 2015, 15% of the world&#x27;s population.

The statistics evidence the impact of digital media communications today. What is also of relevance is the fact that the number of smart device users is rising rapidly yet the amount of functional uses increase daily. A smartphone or tablet can be used for hundreds of daily needs. There are currently over 1 million apps on the Apple App store. These are all opportunities for digital marketing efforts. A smartphone user is impacted with digital advertising every second they open their Apple or Android device. This further evidences the digital revolution and the impact of revolution. This has resulted in a total of 13 billion dollars being paid out to the various app developers over the years. This growth has fueled the development of millions of software applications. Most of these apps are able to generate income via in app advertising. Gross revenue for 2020 is projected to be about $189 million.

===Disruption in industry===
Compared with print media, the mass media, and other analog technologies, digital media are easy to copy, store, share and modify. This quality of digital media has led to significant changes in many industries, especially journalism, publishing, education, entertainment, and the music business. The overall effect of these changes is so far-reaching that it is difficult to quantify. For example, in movie-making, the transition from analog film cameras to digital cameras is nearly complete. The transition has economic benefits to Hollywood, making distribution easier and making it possible to add high-quality digital effects to films. At the same time, it has affected the analog special effects, stunt, and animation industries in Hollywood. It has imposed painful costs on small movie theaters, some of which did not or will not survive the transition to digital. The effect of digital media on other media industries is similarly sweeping and complex.

Between 2000 and 2015, the print newspaper advertising revenue has fallen from $60 billion to a nearly $20 billion. Even one of the most popular days for papers, Sunday, has seen a 9% circulation decrease the lowest since 1945.

In journalism, digital media and citizen journalism have led to the loss of thousands of jobs in print media and the bankruptcy of many major newspapers. But the rise of digital journalism has also created thousands of new jobs and specializations. E-books and self-publishing are changing the book industry, and digital textbooks and other media-inclusive curricula are changing primary and secondary education.

In academia, digital media has led to a new form of scholarship, also called digital scholarship, making open access and open science possible thanks to the low cost of distribution. New fields of study have grown, such as digital humanities and digital history. It has changed the way libraries are used and their role in society. Every major media, communications and academic endeavor is facing a period of transition and uncertainty related to digital media.

Often time the magazine or publisher have a Digital edition which can be referred to an electronic formatted version identical to the print version. There is a huge benefit to the publisher and cost, as half of traditional publishers&#x27; costs come from production, including raw materials, technical processing, and distribution. 

Since 2004, there has been a decrease in newspaper industry employment, with only about 40,000 people working in the workforce currently. Alliance of Audited Media &amp; Publishers information during the 2008 recession, over 10% of print sales are diminished for certain magazines, with a hardship coming from only 75% of the sales advertisements as before. However, in 2018, major newspapers advertising revenue was 35% from digital ads.

In contrast, mobile versions of newspapers and magazines came in second with a huge growth of 135%. The New York Times has noted a 47% year of year rise in their digital subscriptions. 43% of adults get news often from news websites or social media, compared with 49% for television. Pew Research also asked respondents if they got news from a streaming device on their TV – 9% of U.S. adults said that they do so often.

===Individual as content creator===

Digital media has also allowed individuals to be much more active in content creation. Anyone with access to computers and the Internet can participate in social media and contribute their own writing, art, videos, photography and commentary to the Internet, as well as conduct business online. The dramatic reduction in the costs required to create and share content have led to a democratization of content creation as well as the creation of new types of content, like blogs, memes, and video essays. Some of these activities have also been labelled citizen journalism. This spike in user-created content is due to the development of the internet as well as the way in which users interact with media today. As more users join and use social media sites, the relevance of content creation increases. The release of technologies such mobile devices allow for easier and quicker access to all things media. Many media creation tools that were once available to only a few are now free and easy to use. The cost of devices that can access the Internet is steadily falling, and personal ownership of multiple digital devices is now becoming the standard. These elements have significantly affected political participation. Digital media is seen by many scholars as having a role in Arab Spring, and crackdowns on the use of digital and social media by embattled governments are increasingly common. Many governments restrict access to digital media in some way, either to prevent obscenity or in a broader form of political censorship.

Over the years YouTube has grown to become a website with user generated media. This content is oftentimes not mediated by any company or agency, leading to a wide array of personalities and opinions online. Over the years, YouTube and other platforms have also shown their monetary gains. In 2020, the top 10 highest earning YouTube content creators each generated over 15 million dollars. Many of these YouTube profiles over the years have a multi camera set up as we would see on TV. Many of these creators also creating their own digital companies as their personalities grow. Personal devices have also seen an increase over the years. Over 1.5 billion users of tablets exist in this world right now and that is expected to slowly grow About 20% of people in the world regularly watch their content using tablets in 2018

User-generated content raises issues of privacy, credibility, civility and compensation for cultural, intellectual and artistic contributions. The spread of digital media, and the wide range of literacy and communications skills necessary to use it effectively, have deepened the digital divide between those who have access to digital media and those who do not.

The rising of digital media has made the consumer&#x27;s audio collection more precise and personalized. It is no longer necessary to purchase an entire album if the consumer is ultimately interested in only a few audio files.

===Web-only news===
The rise of streaming services has led to a decrease of cable TV services to about 59%, while streaming services are growing at around 29%, and 9% are still users of the digital antenna. TV Controllers now incorporate designated buttons for streaming platforms. Users are spending an average of 1:55 with digital video each day, and only 1:44 on social networks. 6 out of 10 people report viewing their television shows and news via a streaming service. Platforms such as Netflix have gained attraction due to their adorability, accessibility, and for its original content. Companies such as Netflix have even bought previously cancelled shows such as &quot;Designated Survivor&quot;, &quot;Lucifer&quot;, and &quot;Arrested Development&quot;. As the internet becomes more and more prevalent, more companies are beginning to distribute content through internet only means. Indeed, young people today are increasingly likely to use TikTok over Google, television or newspapers for their news. With the loss of viewers, there is a loss of revenue but not as bad as what would be expected.

As of 2024 there has also been a wave of those considered too controversial by main-stream media moving over to online platforms such as X (formerly Twitter) to keep spreading their messages. One instance is Tucker Carlson leaving Fox News due to his controversial opinions and moving over to X. This has sparked debate surrounding topics such as free speech and hate speech.

===Copyright challenges===
Digital media encompasses numerical networks of interactive systems that link databases, allowing users to navigate from one bit of content or webpage to another. Because of this ease, digital media poses several challenges to the current copyright and intellectual property laws. The ease of creating, modifying, and sharing digital media can influence copyright enforcement challenging and many copyright laws are widely seen as outdated. Under current copyright law, common Internet memes are generally illegal to share in many countries. Legal rights can be unclear for many common Internet activities. These include posting pictures from someone else&#x27;s social media account, writing fanfiction, or covering and/or using popular songs in content such as YouTube videos. During the last decade, the concepts of fair use and copyright have been applied to different types of online media.

Copyright challenges are spreading to all parts of digital media. Content creators on platforms such as YouTube follow guidelines set by copyright, IP laws, and the platform&#x27;s copyright requirements. If these guidelines are not followed, the content may get demonetized, deleted, or sued. The situation can also occur when creators accidentally use audio tracks or background scenes that are under copyright. To avoid or resolve some of these issues, content creators can voluntarily adopt open, or copyleft licenses or they can release their work to the public domain. By doing this, creators are giving up certain legal rights regarding their content. Fair use is a doctrine of the US Copyright Law that allows limited use of copyrighted materials without the need to obtain permission. There are four factors that make up fair use. The first, Purpose, refers to what the content is being used for. The second factor is what copyrighted content is being used. If the content is non-fiction, it is more likely to fall under fair use than if the content is fiction. The third factor is how much of the copyrighted content is in use. Small amounts of copyrighted content are more likely to be considered fair. The last factor is, whether the use of copyrighted content earns money or affect the value of the content.

Wikipedia uses some of the most common open licenses, Creative Commons licenses, and the GNU Free Documentation License. Open licenses are one aspect of a broad open content movement that advocates for the reduction or removal of copyright restrictions from software, data, and other digital media. To facilitate the collection and consumption of such licensing information and availability status, tools like the Creative Commons Search engine are used mostly for web images, and Unpaywall, or used for scholarly communication.

Additional software has been developed to restrict access to digital media. Digital rights management (DRM) is used to lock material. This allows users to apply the media content to specific cases. DRM allows movie producers to rent at a lower price. This restricts the movie rental license length, rather than only selling the movie at full price. Additionally, DRM can prevent unauthorized modification or sharing of media. 

Digital media copyright protection technologies fall under intellectual property protection technology. This is because a series of computer technologies protect the digital content being created and transmitted. &quot;The Digital Millennium Copyright Act&quot; (DMCA) provides safety to intermediaries that host user content, such as YouTube, from being held liable for copyright infringement so long as they meet all required conditions. The most notable of which is the &quot;notice and take down&quot; policy. The policy requires online intermediaries to remove and/or disable access to the content in question when there are court orders and/or allegations of illegal use of the content on their site. As a result, YouTube has and continues to develop more policies and standards that go far past what the DMCA requires. YouTube has also created an algorithm which continuously scans their cite to make sure all content follows all policies.

One digital media platform known to have copyright concerns is the short video-sharing app TikTok. TikTok is a social media app that allows users to share short videos up to one minute in length, using a variety of visual effects and audio. According to Loyola University&#x27;s Chicago School of Law, around 50% of the music used on TikTok is unlicensed. TikTok has several music licensing agreements with various artists and labels, creating a library of fair and legal use of music. However, this does not cover all content for its users. A user could still commit a copyright violation on TikTok. One example is, accidentally having music playing on a stereo in the background or recording a laptop screen playing a song.

Online magazines or digital magazines are one of the largest targets for copyright issues. According to the Audit Bureau of Circulations report from March 2011, the definition of this medium is when a digital magazine involves the distribution of magazine content by electronic means; it may be a replica. This definition can be considered outdated now that PDF replicas of print magazines are no longer common practice. These days digital magazines refer to magazines specifically created to be interactive digital platforms such as the internet, mobile phones, private networks, iPad, or other devices. The barriers to digital magazine distribution are thus decreasing. However, these platforms are also broadening the scope of where digital magazines can be published; smartphones are an example. Thanks to the improvements in tablets and other personal electronic devices, digital magazines have become much more readable and enticing through the use of graphic art. The evolution of online magazines began to focus on becoming more of a social media and entertainment platform.

Online piracy has become one of the larger issues that have occurred concerning digital media copyright. The piracy of digital media, such as film and television, directly impacts the copyright party (the owner of the copyright). This action can impact the &quot;health&quot; of the digital media industry. Piracy directly breaks the laws and morals of copyright. Along with piracy, digital media has contributed to the ability to spread false information or fake news. Due to the widespread use of digital media, fake news can receive more notoriety. This notoriety enhances the negative effects fake news creates. As a result, people&#x27;s health and well-being can directly be affected.

<text>Santa Fe de Nuevo México (; shortened as Nuevo México or Nuevo Méjico, and translated as New Mexico in English) was a province of the Spanish Empire and New Spain, and later a territory of independent Mexico. The first capital was San Juan de los Caballeros (at San Gabriel de Yungue-Ouinge) from 1598 until 1610, and from 1610 onward the capital was La Villa Real de la Santa Fe de San Francisco de Asís.

The name of &quot;New Mexico&quot;, the capital in Santa Fe, the gubernatorial office at the Palace of the Governors, &quot;vecino&quot; citizen-soldiers, and rule of law were retained as the New Mexico Territory and later state of New Mexico became part of the United States. The New Mexican citizenry, primarily consisting of Hispano, Pueblo, Navajo, Apache, and Comanche peoples, became citizens of the United States as a result of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (1848).

&#x27; is often incorrectly believed to have taken its name from the post-independent nation of Mexico. But as early as 1561 (260 years before [[Mexican War of Independence|Mexican independence]]), Spanish colonial explorers used&#x27; to refer to Cíbola, cities of wealth reported to exist far to the north of the recently conquered Mexico. This name also evoked the Mexica people&#x27;s accounts of their ancestral origin in Aztlán to the north before their migration to Mexico centuries prior. The Nahuatl-language history of the Mexica people, the &quot;Crónica Mexicayotl&quot;, dated to 1609, makes this identification explicit, describing how the Mexica left &quot;their home there in Old , which today they call New Mexico ().&quot;

==Geography==

Nuevo México was centered on the upper valley of the Rio Grande (Río Bravo del Norte): from the crossing point of Oñate on the river south of Ciudad Juárez, it extended north to the Arkansas River, encompassing an area that included most of the present-day American state of New Mexico and sections of Texas, Colorado, Kansas, and the Oklahoma panhandle. Actual Spanish settlements were centered at Santa Fe, and extended north to Taos pueblo and south to Albuquerque. Except for the first decade of the province&#x27;s existence, its capital was in the foothills of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains at the ancient city of La Villa Real de la Santa Fe de San Francisco de Asís (modern-day Santa Fe).

==History==
===Spanish colonial province===
====16th century====
In 1536, the legendary explorers Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca and Estevanico, and two other men, survived an ill-fated expedition known as the Narváez expedition. For 8 years they wandered across what is today northern Mexico and the Southwest United States. In 1539, Fray Marcos de Niza led an expedition north from Mexico City. He caught glimpse of a Zuni town in the distance, probably Hawikuh, and returned to Mexico City claiming it might have been one of the fabled Seven Cities of Gold. The disappearance of Estevanico in the region prompted future expeditions to be more heavily armed, and far more cautious. 1540-1542 with Marcos de Niza&#x27;s tales in mind, Francisco Vázquez de Coronado began the most ambitious expedition. Fears caused by rumors surrounding Estevanico&#x27;s disappearance eventually led to tensions underlying the Tiguex War. In two years, the Coronado expedition journeyed from present-day Mexico throughout the Southwest United States and as far east as Kansas.

In 1581-1582, Fray Augustin Rodriguez, two other friars, and a few soldiers and servants walked across much of present-day New Mexico seeking converts.

In 1590-1591, an order had arrived from Spain requiring all expeditions to be authorized by the crown. However, Lieutenant Governor Gaspar Castano de Sosa of Nuevo Leon launched an expedition on his own authority. He planned to start a colony in New Mexico and persuade the viceroy to accept it after the fact. Pursued through New Mexico, he was arrested and taken back to Mexico City.

On July 12, 1598, Don Juan de Oñate Salazar established the New Spain colony of &quot;Santa Fe de Nuevo Méjico&quot; at the new village of San Juan de los Caballeros adjacent to the Ohkay Owingeh Pueblo at the confluence of the Río Bravo (Rio Grande) and the Río Chama. The expedition had been authorized by Philip II to survey the region. Though the Spanish believed that cities of gold such as Tenochtitlan of the Aztecs, whom they had previously conquered, lay to the north in the unexplored territory, the major goal was to spread Catholicism. Other expeditions had taken place before Oñate&#x27;s 1598 expedition. He was unable to find any riches, however. As governor, he mingled with the Pueblo people and was responsible for the establishment of Spanish rule in the area. Oñate served as the first governor of the Nuevo México Province from 1598 to 1610. He hoped to make it a separate viceroyalty from New Spain in an original agreement made in 1595, but the terms failed when the Viceroy changed hands in 1596. After a two-year delay and lengthy vetting by the new viceroy, Oñate was finally allowed to cross the Rio Grande River into modern-day Texas and New Mexico.

====17th century====
Most of the Spanish missions in Nuevo México were established during the early 17th century with varying degrees of success and failure, oftentimes building directly atop ancient pueblo ruins, and in the centers of pueblos. The encounter between different worlds--Native and Spanish--took place all across New Mexico, but especially at the missions. They were small communities, centers of Spanish religious and economic life, and a permanent intrusion into Pueblo ways and beliefs. Here the clash of faiths, customs, and people was immediate, personal, and sometimes bitter and violent. At missions across New Mexico, Franciscan priests baptized thousands of Native Americans in the 1600s, mostly Pueblo people. The missionaries commanded new converts to take part in Catholic services and rituals. They also destroyed Pueblo religious objects, banned ceremonies, and persecuted holy men. Despite the spread of Catholicism across the province, Pueblo men and women worshiped in secret and their traditional faith endured. By 1668, Juan de Medrano y Mesía became governor of the province, holding this position until 1671. His tenure was marked most notably by Apache raids in the region.

Some pueblos were friendly to the foreigners, but after cultural differences and the banishment of local religions, tensions against the Spanish rose significantly. After compounding misdeeds and overbearing taxes by the Spanish invaders, the indigenous communities rebelled in what is now referred to as the Pueblo Revolt of 1680. This rebellion saw the Spanish expelled from Nuevo México for a period of 12 years, and the pueblo people were able to regain lost lands. In 1692, they returned to battle against the Spanish, who sought restoration of the conquered holdings. Diego de Vargas achieved the reoccupation of Santa Fe. The province came under the jurisdiction of the &quot;Real Audiencia de Guadalajara&quot;, with oversight by the Viceroy of New Spain at Mexico City.

====18th century====
In 1777, with the creation of the Commandancy General of the Provincias Internas, the Nuevo México Province was removed from the oversight of the Viceroy and placed solely in the jurisdiction of the new commandant general. This caused much unrest, due to the sudden lack of representation in Santa Fe for the region of Nuevo México.

===Mexican territory===

The province remained in Spanish control until Mexico&#x27;s declaration of independence in 1821. Under the 1824 Constitution of Mexico, it became the federally administered Territory of New Mexico.

The part of the former province east of the Rio Grande was claimed by the Republic of Texas, which won its independence in 1836. This claim was disputed by Mexico. In 1841, the Texans sent the Texan Santa Fe Expedition, ostensibly for trade but with hopes of occupying the claimed area, but the expedition was captured by New Mexican troops under New Mexico governor Manuel Armijo.

===American territory===
The United States inherited the unenforced claim to the east bank with the Texas Annexation in 1845. The U.S. Army under Stephen Kearny occupied the territory in 1846 during the Mexican–American War, a provisional government was established, and Mexico recognized its loss to the United States in 1848 with the Mexican Cession in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.

Texas continued to claim the eastern part, but never succeeded in establishing control except in El Paso. However, in the Compromise of 1850 Texas accepted $10 million in exchange for its claim to areas within and north of the present boundaries of New Mexico and the Texas panhandle.

Presidents Zachary Taylor and Abraham Lincoln both proposed that New Mexico immediately become a state to sidestep political conflict over slavery in the territories. The already established rule of law which had passed from New Spain and Mexico within New Mexico already outlawed slavery, as was the legal precedent with genízaros.

New Mexico became an official U.S. state in 1912.

<text>Stiff Records is a British independent record label formed in London, England, by Dave Robinson and Jake Riviera. Originally active from 1976 to 1986, the label was reactivated in 2007.

Established at the outset of the punk rock boom, Stiff signed various punk rock and new wave acts such as Nick Lowe, the Damned, Lene Lovich, Wreckless Eric, Elvis Costello, Ian Dury, and Devo, also signing artists with significant crossover appeal such as Motörhead, Larry Wallis and Mick Farren. In the 1980s, with most of their early signings having moved on, the label found commercial success with Madness, The Pogues, Tracey Ullman, The Belle Stars, Kirsty MacColl and others.

In December 2017, Universal Music Group acquired Stiff Records and ZTT Records. Razor &amp; Tie, a division of the Concord Music Group, holds the American rights to the Stiff catalogue. The British rights to the Stiff catalogue were held by BMG Rights Management under Union Square Music until 2022, when Universal relaunched the Stiff and ZTT labels.

==History==
Robinson and Riviera were well-known London music business characters. Robinson had briefly worked for Jimi Hendrix in the late 1960s and also managed minor pub rock band Brinsley Schwarz in the early 1970s, in which Nick Lowe was the bassist, vocalist and main songwriter; while Riviera had been an early manager for another pub rock band, Dr. Feelgood, from Essex. The label was started with a loan of £400 from Lee Brilleaux of Dr. Feelgood.

Originally, Stiff had been called Demon, but the phrase &quot;It’s a stiff!&quot; was more appropriate for the artists on the record label. Stiff found quick success. Its first release, on 14 August 1976, was a single (in the normal 7&quot; vinyl 45 rpm format) by Nick Lowe, &quot;So It Goes&quot;, B-side &quot;Heart of the City&quot;, with the striking catalogue number BUY 1. That record sold 10,000 copies, but Stiff&#x27;s next release, &quot;Between The Lines&quot; by Pink Fairies, sold only around half of that. Robinson and Riviera used money from their Advancedale management company to finance the release of what is generally accepted as the United Kingdom&#x27;s first punk single, &quot;New Rose&quot; by The Damned, on 22 October 1976.

Early in 1977, Stiff Records picked up speed, signing Wreckless Eric, Ian Dury, and Elvis Costello, who had once been a part-time roadie for Brinsley Schwarz. Bigger sales followed, and a distribution deal with Island Records through EMI was set up. After arranging for Costello and Lowe to be signed directly to CBS Records&#x27; Columbia label, a similar deal was made with Arista who released Ian Dury&#x27;s first album and the &quot;Live Stiffs Live&quot; album. The deal was short-lived and Stiff then made a deal with CBS Records for Stiff releases in the United States, at both the Columbia and Epic subsidiaries on the Stiff/Columbia and Stiff/Epic labels.

Robinson and Riviera were a fiery management combination, and after a series of disagreements, Riviera left Stiff in early 1978 to form the short-lived Radar Records, taking Elvis Costello, Nick Lowe and Yachts with him as a settlement package. Riviera&#x27;s departure coincided with the end of the &quot;5 Live Stiffs Tour&quot;, which showcased emerging star Ian Dury. Dury&#x27;s album &quot;New Boots &amp; Panties!!&quot; had raced up the charts and its sales kept the label in business over the following months. In 1979, Robinson signed Madness, who released albums from 1979 to 1984.

The next few years were the halcyon period, with many Top 20 single chart placings, including the label&#x27;s first No. 1 single, &quot;Hit Me with Your Rhythm Stick&quot; by Ian Dury, and a number of other big-selling albums. Stiff expanded rapidly and moved its premises twice. It also continued to release dozens of obscure and uncommercial releases. For example, Stiff Records released the parody album &quot;The Wit &amp; Wisdom of Ronald Reagan&quot;. That LP, on Magic Records, was completely silent on both sides, with Reagan&#x27;s own slogan, &quot;If it&#x27;s a success it must be Magic!&quot;.

At the end of 1983, Island Records bought 50% of Stiff, and Robinson ran both labels. Island was very short of money at the time and Robinson had to lend it £1,000,000 to fund the share purchase and pay the payroll. In 1984 Island Records released hit single &quot;Relax&quot; by Frankie Goes to Hollywood. Stiff signed The Pogues, but then Madness left under a cloud. The Island deal failed and Dave Robinson regained control of the newly independent label in 1985. Hits by The Pogues and Furniture helped Stiff to survive another twenty months, but the underlying causes for the failure of the Island deal finally became too burdensome for Stiff and it was sold to ZTT in 1987.

In 2007, ZTT and its parent company SPZ Group reactivated the label. Stiff quickly broke one of the UK&#x27;s hottest new indie acts, The Enemy. It then released a string of well-received albums of new work from legacy Stiff artists, including as Wreckless Eric, Henry Priestman, Any Trouble, and Chris Difford. Brand new acts signed to the label included The Tranzmitors and Eskimo Disco. Swedish designer Tobbe Stuhre was appointed official Stiff Records designer.

In 2008, Union Square Music released &quot;The Big Stiff Box Set&quot;.

==The Stiffs Tours==

Robinson and Riviera had arranged package tours ‒ such as the 1975 &quot;Naughty Rhythms&quot; tour ‒ for acts they managed before forming Stiff. The first tour, known as the &quot;Live Stiffs Tour&quot; or &quot;5 Live Stiffs&quot; (3 October – 5 November 1977), comprised five bands: Elvis Costello and The Attractions, Ian Dury and the Blockheads, Wreckless Eric and The New Rockets, Nick Lowe&#x27;s Last Chicken in the Shop, and Larry Wallis&#x27;s Psychedelic Rowdies. Having signed all the named artists as individuals, bands had to be formed in order to tour: these were largely based on the session musicians used for the artists&#x27; solo records. There were 18 musicians on the tour, several doubling up, e.g. Dury playing drums for Wreckless Eric while the last two &quot;bands&quot; had the same line up (Nick Lowe, Larry Wallis, Dave Edmunds, Terry Williams, Pete Thomas and Penny Tobin).

The original idea was that the running order would rotate each night, but Dury and Costello were clearly the strongest acts. Costello played mostly new material and cover versions, rather than numbers from his recently released album &quot;My Aim is True&quot;, so the gigs usually ended with most of the artists on stage performing Dury&#x27;s &quot;Sex &amp; Drugs &amp; Rock &amp; Roll&quot;. A live album entitled &quot;Live Stiffs Live&quot; and a video of the tour were produced, but the tour only covered the UK.

After the departure of Riviera, Robinson arranged a second tour, the &quot;Be Stiff&quot; or the &quot;Be Stiff Route 78&quot; tour, from October to November 1978 (UK), again comprising five acts; Wreckless Eric, Lene Lovich, Jona Lewie, Mickey Jupp, and Rachel Sweet. The mainland section of the UK tour was undertaken by train and the Irish section by coach, and then continued on to the USA without Jupp, who was afraid of flying. The artists contributed to an EP with cover versions of the Devo song, and early Stiff single, &quot;Be Stiff&quot;.

The final tour, the &quot;Son of Stiff Tour 1980&quot;, comprised Ten Pole Tudor, Any Trouble, Dirty Looks, Joe &quot;King&quot; Carrasco and the Crowns, and The Equators. Undertaken by bus, this European tour was not successful. The tour led to a 12&quot; EP &quot;Son of Stiff Tour 1980&quot; (SON 1) and a short movie directed by Jeff Baynes. The movie has not been released for sale, but was shown on BBC4 in September 2006.

==Marketing and design==
The label&#x27;s marketing and advertising was often provocative and witty, billing itself as &quot;The World&#x27;s Most Flexible Record Label&quot;. Other slogans were &quot;We came. We saw. We left&quot;, &quot;If It Ain&#x27;t Stiff, It Ain&#x27;t Worth a Fuck&quot;, and &quot;When You Kill Time, You Murder Success&quot; (printed on promotional wall clocks). On the label of Stiff&#x27;s sampler compilation &quot;Heroes &amp; Cowards&quot; was printed: &quot;In &#x27;78 everyone born in &#x27;45 will be 33-1/3&quot;. A very early Stiff sampler album, &quot;A Bunch of Stiff Records&quot;, introduced the slogan, &quot;If they&#x27;re dead, we&#x27;ll sign them&quot; and &quot;Undertakers to the Industry&quot;.

Stiff also produced eccentric but highly effective promotional campaigns, such as the three package tours in 1977 (Live Stiffs), 1978 (Be Stiff) and 1980 (Son of Stiff), Elvis Costello&#x27;s &quot;street performance&quot; outside CBS Records.

Barney Bubbles was responsible for much of the graphic art associated with the early Stiff releases.

<doc id="53734" wikidata="Q1243369" url="?curid=53734" title="Double-precision floating-point format">
<text>Double-precision floating-point format (sometimes called FP64 or float64) is a floating-point number format, usually occupying 64 bits in computer memory; it represents a wide range of numeric values by using a floating radix point.

Double precision may be chosen when the range or precision of single precision would be insufficient.

In the IEEE 754 standard, the 64-bit base-2 format is officially referred to as binary64; it was called double in IEEE 754-1985. IEEE 754 specifies additional floating-point formats, including 32-bit base-2 &quot;single precision&quot; and, more recently, base-10 representations (decimal floating point).

One of the first programming languages to provide floating-point data types was Fortran. Before the widespread adoption of IEEE 754-1985, the representation and properties of floating-point data types depended on the computer manufacturer and computer model, and upon decisions made by programming-language implementers. E.g., GW-BASIC&#x27;s double-precision data type was the 64-bit MBF floating-point format.
==IEEE 754 double-precision binary floating-point format: binary64==
Double-precision binary floating-point is a commonly used format on PCs, due to its wider range over single-precision floating point, in spite of its performance and bandwidth cost. It is commonly known simply as &quot;double&quot;. The IEEE 754 standard specifies a binary64 as having:
* Sign bit: 1 bit
* Exponent: 11 bits
* Significand precision: 53 bits (52 explicitly stored)
The sign bit determines the sign of the number (including when this number is zero, which is signed).

The exponent field is an 11-bit unsigned integer from 0 to 2047, in biased form: an exponent value of 1023 represents the actual zero. Exponents range from −1022 to +1023 because exponents of −1023 (all 0s) and +1024 (all 1s) are reserved for special numbers.

The 53-bit significand precision gives from 15 to 17 significant decimal digits precision (2−53 ≈ 1.11 × 10−16). If a decimal string with at most 15 significant digits is converted to the IEEE 754 double-precision format, giving a normal number, and then converted back to a decimal string with the same number of digits, the final result should match the original string. If an IEEE 754 double-precision number is converted to a decimal string with at least 17 significant digits, and then converted back to double-precision representation, the final result must match the original number.

The format is written with the significand having an implicit integer bit of value 1 (except for special data, see the exponent encoding below). With the 52 bits of the fraction (F) significand appearing in the memory format, the total precision is therefore 53 bits (approximately 16 decimal digits, 53 log10(2) ≈ 15.955). The bits are laid out as follows:

The real value assumed by a given 64-bit double-precision datum with a given biased exponent formula_1 
and a 52-bit fraction is
: formula_2
or
: formula_3

Between 252=4,503,599,627,370,496 and 253=9,007,199,254,740,992 the representable numbers are exactly the integers. For the next range, from 253 to 254, everything is multiplied by 2, so the representable numbers are the even ones, etc. Conversely, for the previous range from 251 to 252, the spacing is 0.5, etc.

The spacing as a fraction of the numbers in the range from 2&quot;n&quot; to 2&quot;n&quot;+1 is 2&quot;n&quot;−52.
The maximum relative rounding error when rounding a number to the nearest representable one (the machine epsilon) is therefore 2−53.

The 11 bit width of the exponent allows the representation of numbers between 10−308 and 10308, with full 15–17 decimal digits precision. By compromising precision, the subnormal representation allows even smaller values up to about 5 × 10−324.

===Exponent encoding===
The double-precision binary floating-point exponent is encoded using an offset-binary representation, with the zero offset being 1023; also known as exponent bias in the IEEE 754 standard. Examples of such representations would be:
The exponents codice_1 and codice_2 have a special meaning:
* codice_3=codice_1 is used to represent a signed zero (if &quot;F&quot; = 0) and subnormal numbers (if &quot;F&quot; ≠ 0); and
* codice_5=codice_2 is used to represent ∞ (if &quot;F&quot; = 0) and NaNs (if &quot;F&quot; ≠ 0),
where &quot;F&quot; is the fractional part of the significand. All bit patterns are valid encoding.

Except for the above exceptions, the entire double-precision number is described by:

: formula_4

In the case of subnormal numbers (&quot;e&quot; = 0) the double-precision number is described by:

: formula_5

===Endianness===
===Double-precision examples===





Encodings of qNaN and sNaN are not completely specified in IEEE 754 and depend on the processor. Most processors, such as the x86 family and the ARM family processors, use the most significant bit of the significand field to indicate a quiet NaN; this is what is recommended by IEEE 754. The PA-RISC processors use the bit to indicate a signaling NaN.

By default, 1/3 rounds down, instead of up like single precision, because of the odd number of bits in the significand.

In more detail:
 Given the hexadecimal representation 3FD5 5555 5555 555516,
 Sign = 0
 Exponent = 3FD16 = 1021
 Exponent Bias = 1023 (constant value; see above)
 Fraction = 5 5555 5555 555516
 Value = 2(Exponent − Exponent Bias) × 1.Fraction – Note that Fraction must not be converted to decimal here
 = 2−2 × (15 5555 5555 555516 × 2−52)
 = 2−54 × 15 5555 5555 555516
 = 0.333333333333333314829616256247390992939472198486328125
 ≈ 1/3

===Execution speed with double-precision arithmetic===
Using double-precision floating-point variables is usually slower than working with their single precision counterparts. One area of computing where this is a particular issue is parallel code running on GPUs. For example, when using NVIDIA&#x27;s CUDA platform, calculations with double precision can take, depending on hardware, from 2 to 32 times as long to complete compared to those done using single precision.

Additionally, many mathematical functions (e.g., sin, cos, atan2, log, exp and sqrt) need more computations to give accurate double-precision results, and are therefore slower.

=== Precision limitations on integer values ===
* Integers from −253 to 253 (−9,007,199,254,740,992 to 9,007,199,254,740,992) can be exactly represented.
* Integers between 253 and 254 = 18,014,398,509,481,984 round to a multiple of 2 (even number).
* Integers between 254 and 255 = 36,028,797,018,963,968 round to a multiple of 4.
* Integers between 2&quot;n&quot; and 2&quot;n&quot;+1 round to a multiple of 2&quot;n&quot;−52.

==Implementations==
Doubles are implemented in many programming languages in different ways such as the following. On processors with only dynamic precision, such as x86 without SSE2 (or when SSE2 is not used, for compatibility purpose) and with extended precision used by default, software may have difficulties to fulfill some requirements.

===C and C++===
C and C++ offer a wide variety of arithmetic types. Double precision is not required by the standards (except by the optional annex F of C99, covering IEEE 754 arithmetic), but on most systems, the codice_7 type corresponds to double precision. However, on 32-bit x86 with extended precision by default, some compilers may not conform to the C standard or the arithmetic may suffer from double rounding.

===Fortran===
Fortran provides several integer and real types, and the 64-bit type codice_8, accessible via Fortran&#x27;s intrinsic module codice_9, corresponds to double precision.

===Common Lisp===
Common Lisp provides the types SHORT-FLOAT, SINGLE-FLOAT, DOUBLE-FLOAT and LONG-FLOAT. Most implementations provide SINGLE-FLOATs and DOUBLE-FLOATs with the other types appropriate synonyms. Common Lisp provides exceptions for catching floating-point underflows and overflows, and the inexact floating-point exception, as per IEEE 754. No infinities and NaNs are described in the ANSI standard, however, several implementations do provide these as extensions.

===Java===

On Java before version 1.2, every implementation had to be IEEE 754 compliant. Version 1.2 allowed implementations to bring extra precision in intermediate computations for platforms like x87. Thus a modifier strictfp was introduced to enforce strict IEEE 754 computations. Strict floating point has been restored in Java 17.

===JavaScript===
As specified by the ECMAScript standard, all arithmetic in JavaScript shall be done using double-precision floating-point arithmetic.
===JSON===
The JSON data encoding format supports numeric values, and the grammar to which numeric expressions must conform has no limits on the precision or range of the numbers so encoded. However, RFC 8259 advises that, since IEEE 754 binary64 numbers are widely implemented, good interoperability can be achieved by implementations processing JSON if they expect no more precision or range than binary64 offers.

===Rust and Zig===
Rust and Zig have the codice_10 data type.

<doc id="53736" wikidata="Q192812" url="?curid=53736" title="Hayden Christensen">
<text>Hayden Christensen (born April 19, 1981) is a Canadian actor. He is best known for his portrayal of Anakin Skywalker / Darth Vader in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; media franchise. He first appeared in the prequel trilogy films, &quot;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot; (2002) and &quot;Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith&quot; (2005), and later reprised his role in the Disney+ series &quot;Obi-Wan Kenobi&quot; (2022) and &quot;Ahsoka&quot; (2023).

Christensen began his career on Canadian television at the age of 13, then diversified into American television in the late 1990s. His early work includes Sofia Coppola&#x27;s &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot; (1999), &quot;Life as a House&quot; (2001), and &quot;Shattered Glass&quot; (2003). He earned praise for his performances as Sam in &quot;Life as a House&quot; and as Stephen Glass in &quot;Shattered Glass&quot;. Christensen&#x27;s honours include the nominations for a Golden Globe Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award, as well as the Cannes Film Festival&#x27;s Trophée Chopard. His other notable works include &quot;Awake&quot; (2007), &quot;Jumper&quot; (2008), &quot;Takers&quot; (2010), and &quot;Little Italy&quot; (2018).

==Early life==
Christensen was born in Vancouver, British Columbia to Alie, an American speechwriter, and David Christensen, a Canadian computer programmer and communications executive. His father is of Danish descent, and his mother has Swedish and Italian ancestry. Christensen is one of four children, with three actor siblings: older brother Tove, older sister Hejsa, and younger sister Kaylen. He spent summers on Long Island with his maternal grandmother, Rose Schwartz.

Christensen attended Unionville High School in Markham, Ontario. He was an athlete in high school, playing hockey competitively and tennis on a provincial level. He attended the Actors Studio in New York City; he studied as well at the Arts York drama program in high school. After accompanying his older sister to her agent&#x27;s office after she landed a role in a Pringles commercial, he began being cast in commercials as well, including for Triaminic cough syrup in 1988.

==Career==

===1993–2005===
Christensen made his acting debut in September 1993, when, at the age of 12, he played a supporting role on the German-Canadian television series &quot;Macht Der Leidenschaft/Family Passions.&quot; The following year, he had a minor role in John Carpenter&#x27;s &quot;In the Mouth of Madness&quot;. From 1995 through 1999, he appeared in several films and television series, including &quot;Harrison Bergeron&quot;, &quot;Forever Knight&quot;, &quot;Goosebumps&quot;, &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot;, and &quot;Are You Afraid of the Dark?&quot;

He acquired wider notice while starring in Fox Family Channel&#x27;s television series &quot;Higher Ground&quot; in 2000, portraying a teen who was sexually molested by his stepmother, and then turned to drugs in his despair.

Christensen&#x27;s critically acclaimed portrayal of a misunderstood teenager in &quot;Life as a House&quot; (2001) earned him Golden Globe and SAG Award nominations, as well as the National Board of Review&#x27;s award for &quot;Breakthrough Performance of the Year&quot;. However, the performance did not receive widespread public notice. In 2002, Christensen made his London theatre debut with Jake Gyllenhaal and Anna Paquin in &quot;This Is Our Youth&quot;.

He went on to receive positive reviews for 2003&#x27;s &quot;Shattered Glass&quot;, which tells the true story of journalist Stephen Glass, who was discovered to be fabricating stories as a writer for &quot;The New Republic&quot; and other publications. Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote, &quot;Hayden Christensen is sensational as Glass, finding the wonder boy and the weasel in a disturbed kid flying high on a fame he hasn&#x27;t earned.&quot; In 2005, Christensen made his Broadway debut when he appeared briefly in a 10-minute play.

In 2005, he took part in the fifth annual &quot;24 Hour Plays&quot; benefit, which raises cash for nonprofit groups in the Big Apple.

====&quot;Star Wars&quot;====

On May 12, 2000, Christensen announced that he would be starring as an adult Anakin Skywalker in &quot;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot; (2002) and &quot;Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith&quot; (2005); Skywalker was previously portrayed by Jake Lloyd as a child in &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot; (1999). The casting director reviewed about 1,500 other candidates before director George Lucas selected Christensen. Lucas is quoted as saying that he chose Christensen because he &quot;needed an actor who has that presence of the Dark Side&quot;. This was essential to solidify the story that Lucas was trying to tell: Anakin Skywalker&#x27;s fall from grace and transformation into Darth Vader.

During the production of &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;, Christensen asked Lucas if a special Vader suit could be constructed to fit his own body, rather than have a different actor don one of the original sets of Vader armour worn by David Prowse. Lucas agreed, and a suit was engineered to fit Christensen&#x27;s frame, even including extensions to allow for the actor to attain Vader&#x27;s height. His voice as the &quot;robotic&quot; Vader, however, was dubbed over by James Earl Jones, who first made the voice famous in the original trilogy.

In one of the most controversial changes made to the &quot;Star Wars&quot; original trilogy, Christensen was inserted into the 2004 DVD release of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, where he replaced Sebastian Shaw as the force ghost of the redeemed Anakin Skywalker. Lucas wanted Anakin&#x27;s inner person to return to who he was before he turned to the dark side. Christensen insisted this was done without his knowledge, an act that was confirmed by Lucasfilm itself in the featurette &quot;Return of the Jedi: What has changed?&quot; as seen on the official website to commemorate the 2006 DVDs.

Christensen&#x27;s performance in both &quot;Episode II&quot; and &quot;III&quot; received generally mixed reviews from critics, although contemporary reviews note that his performance was mostly affected by Lucas&#x27; directing and the dialogue, and has since seen positive reappraisal in retrospect.

Christensen was named in both &quot;People&quot; magazine&#x27;s 50 Most Beautiful People and &quot;Teen People&quot;″s 25 Hottest Stars under 25. For his performance in &quot;Episode III&quot;, he won the MTV Movie Award for Best Villain.

===2006–2018===
Between 2006 and 2007, he starred in &quot;Awake&quot;, with Jessica Alba, which tells the story of a man who remains awake but paralyzed during heart surgery, and co-starred in &quot;Factory Girl&quot;, opposite Sienna Miller and Guy Pearce. Christensen next co-starred with Samuel L. Jackson, Jamie Bell, and Rachel Bilson in the film &quot;Jumper&quot;, the story of a young man who discovers he has the ability to teleport; the film was released on February 14, 2008. Bilson and Christensen co-starred again in the same segment of the film &quot;New York, I Love You&quot;. Christensen appeared opposite Mischa Barton in &quot;Virgin Territory&quot;, which was released directly-to-DVD in North America on August 26, 2008. The film, based on &quot;The Decameron&quot;, is about a group of people who escape the Black Plague epidemic by hiding out in a Tuscan villa in Italy.

In October 2009, Christensen started shooting the horror film &quot;Vanishing on 7th Street&quot;, directed by Brad Anderson, with Thandiwe Newton and John Leguizamo. Christensen appeared in the crime drama &quot;Takers&quot; with Idris Elba and Paul Walker, released in the United States on August 27, 2010. &quot;Quantum Quest: A Cassini Space Odyssey&quot; is the fourth film in which Christensen stars with Samuel L. Jackson.

In 2010, Christensen sued USA Network over allegations that they stole his idea for the TV show &quot;Royal Pains&quot;. The suit alleges that Christensen met with USA to pitch a similar series entitled &quot;Housecalls&quot;. During the meeting, Christensen alleges, he was never informed that a similar program was in development. Although a federal judge at first dismissed Christensen&#x27;s lawsuit in 2011, in June 2012, the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals reversed this decision and remanded the case back to the district court for further proceedings, in what was considered a legal victory for Christensen.

On May 20, 2013, during the Cannes Film Festival, the Russian company Enjoy Movies announced the creation of Glacier Films, an alliance company with Christensen and his brother Tove. Over a three-year period, &quot;Glacier Films&quot; intended to make 11 &quot;micro-budget&quot; movies costing $1.5M each. The first project, &quot;American Heist&quot;, starring Christensen, Adrien Brody and Jordana Brewster, started filming in June 2013. It is a remake of Steve McQueen&#x27;s &quot;The Great St. Louis Bank Robbery.&quot; In 2014, he starred in the American-Chinese-Canadian film &quot;Outcast&quot;, an action drama, alongside Nicolas Cage.

In 2015, Christensen starred in the film &quot;90 Minutes in Heaven&quot; co-starring Kate Bosworth and directed by Michael Polish based on the best-selling novel by the same name. In 2015, filming began of an unreleased World War II Nazi zombies horror movie titled &quot;Untöt&quot;, set to star Christensen. In 2017, he was in the film &quot;First Kill&quot; alongside Bruce Willis. In 2018 he appeared in the Canadian-American romantic comedy &quot;Little Italy&quot; with Emma Roberts and in the same year was in &quot;The Last Man&quot;.

=== Return to the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise ===
In 2019, Christensen returned to the role of Anakin Skywalker, providing a voice cameo of the character&#x27;s voice in &quot;Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker&quot;. Christensen also received a voice credit as Anakin Skywalker jointly alongside Matt Lanter for the penultimate episode of the final season of the animated television series &quot;Star Wars: The Clone Wars&quot; entitled &quot;Shattered&quot; despite the fact the dialogue used for the episode spoken by Christensen was reused archival audio from &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;. On October 22, 2021, it was reported that Christensen would also reprise the role for the Disney+ series &quot;Ahsoka&quot;.

In May 2022, Christensen reprised his role of Anakin Skywalker / Darth Vader for the &quot;Obi-Wan Kenobi&quot; limited series on Disney+. His portrayal earned positive reviews from critics, noting a huge improvement from his performance in the prequel trilogy. He appeared in the documentary special &quot;Obi-Wan Kenobi: A Jedi&#x27;s Return&quot; which premiered on September 8, 2022, Disney+ Day. In 2023, Christensen appeared in four episodes of &quot;Ahsoka&quot; and was digitally de-aged. He was first seen wearing his outfit from &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot; and later another outfit similar to the one Anakin wore in the early series of &quot;The Clone Wars&quot;. His portrayal earned more positive reviews.

He has been attending several conventions as part of Star Wars Celebration as a guest since 2017.

==Personal life==
In 2007, Christensen began dating actress Rachel Bilson, with whom he starred in the movie &quot;Jumper&quot;. They became engaged on December 25, 2008. In mid-2010, they broke up, but began dating again a few months later. On October 29, 2014, Bilson gave birth to their daughter. Christensen and Bilson separated in September 2017.

In 2007, Christensen bought a farm near Uxbridge, Ontario. He noted in 2008 that he had been renovating the property himself and devoting time to learning about &quot;livestock, crops, and agricultural machinery&quot;. In November 2013, Christensen collaborated with Canadian fashion chain RW&amp;Co to release a men&#x27;s clothing line inspired by his farm.

Christensen is an avid Toronto Maple Leafs fan. In 2008, Christensen performed a public service announcement for Do Something&#x27;s Teens for Jeans Campaign. He modelled in Louis Vuitton&#x27;s advertising, and was also named as the face of Lacoste&#x27;s newest fragrance, Lacoste Challenge. He was featured in RED&#x27;s &quot;Lazarus Effect Campaign&quot;, which is intended to increase awareness for its efforts to fight AIDS in Africa.

<doc id="53739" wikidata="Q178004" url="?curid=53739" title="Marcian">
<text>Marcian (; ; ; 392 – 27 January 457) was Roman emperor of the East from 450 to 457. Very little is known of his life before becoming emperor, other than that he was a (personal assistant) who served under the commanders Ardabur and his son Aspar for fifteen years. After the death of Emperor Theodosius II on 28 July 450, Marcian was made a candidate for the throne by Aspar, who held much influence because of his military power. After a month of negotiations Pulcheria, Theodosius&#x27; sister, agreed to marry Marcian. Zeno, a military leader whose influence was similar to Aspar&#x27;s, may have been involved in these negotiations, as he was given the high-ranking court title of patrician upon Marcian&#x27;s accession. Marcian was elected and inaugurated on 25 August 450.

Marcian reversed many of the actions of TheodosiusII in the Eastern Roman Empire&#x27;s relationship with the Huns under Attila and in religious matters. Marcian almost immediately revoked all treaties with Attila, ending all subsidy payments to him. In 452, while Attila was raiding Roman Italy, then a part of the Western Roman Empire, Marcian launched expeditions across the Danube into the Great Hungarian Plain, defeating the Huns in their own heartland. This action, accompanied by the famine and plague that broke out in northern Italy, allowed the Western Roman Empire to bribe Attila into retreating from the Italian peninsula.

After Attila&#x27;s death in 453, Marcian took advantage of the resulting fragmentation of the Hunnic confederation by settling Germanic tribes within Roman lands as (&quot;federates&quot; providing military service in exchange for benefits). Marcian also convened the Council of Chalcedon, which declared that Jesus had two &quot;natures&quot;: divine and human. This led to the alienation of the population of the eastern provinces of Syria and Egypt, as many of them were miaphysites, rejecting the new official Christology. Marcian died on 27 January 457, leaving the Eastern Roman Empire with a treasury surplus of seven million solidi coins, an impressive achievement considering the economic ruin inflicted upon the Eastern Roman Empire by the Huns and Theodosius&#x27; tribute payments. After his death, Aspar passed over Marcian&#x27;s son-in-law, Anthemius, and had a military commander, Leo I, elected as emperor.

==Early life==
Marcian was born in 392, in either Thrace or Illyria. The ancient historian John Malalas describes him as being tall and having some sort of foot impediment. Little of Marcian&#x27;s early life is known. His father had served in the military and at a young age Marcian enlisted at Philippopolis in Thrace. By the time of the Roman–Sassanian War of 421–422, Marcian had likely reached the military rank of tribune—the historian Theophanes the Confessor mentions him commanding a military unit. He did not see action in the war, having become ill in Lycia. There he was cared for by Tatianus, who would be made (prefect of Constantinople) by Marcian, and Tatianus&#x27; brother Iulius. Marcian eventually rose to become the (personal assistant) of Aspar, the (commander-in-chief) of the Eastern Roman Empire. Despite being half-Alanic and half-Gothic, Aspar held much influence in the empire. In the early 430s, Marcian served under Aspar in Roman Africa, where he was captured by Vandals. Evagrius Scholasticus, Procopius and later authors give a likely false account in which Marcian, while in captivity, met the Vandal king Gaiseric, who predicted he would later become emperor. After his capture, Marcian is not mentioned again until the death of the eastern emperor, Theodosius II.

==Background==
===Reign of Theodosius II===

The Eastern Roman Empire was plagued by external threats during the reign of Theodosius II. In 429, the Vandals, led by Gaiseric, began to conquer Roman Africa. Theodosius immediately organized a response, sending Aspar and three other commanders to attempt to repel them in the summer of 431. To the north, the Huns, who had customarily attacked the empire whenever its armies were preoccupied, withdrawing as those forces returned, sent ambassadors to Theodosius in 431, demanding tribute. He agreed to their demand to pay of gold each year. In 434, the Eastern Roman armies were still campaigning against the Vandals in Africa, having faced initial defeats and the withdrawal of many of the Western Roman soldiers. In the face of Eastern Roman weakness, the Huns doubled their demand, asking for of gold per year, which Theodosius agreed to. The threat the Huns posed to his weakly protected empire was enough that Theodosius recalled many of his forces from Africa. With large numbers of the Eastern Roman armies home, and Attila, who had just taken power in the Hunnic Confederation, busy campaigning to the north, Theodosius refused to pay the tribute and continued to refuse to until 439.

On 19 October 439, the Vandals defeated the weakened Eastern Roman armies and captured the major city of Carthage. Both the Western and Eastern Roman Empires began preparing a massive counter-offensive, stripping the Balkan provinces of protection. In the spring of 440, 1,100 ships set sail from Constantinople for Africa; sending away so many of the Eastern Roman forces was a huge gamble on Theodosius&#x27; part. He was betting the fortified cities along the Danube could delay the Huns long enough for the invasion force to gain a secure foothold in Africa, allowing troops to be withdrawn back to the northern frontier. This gamble worked until 442 when the bishop of Margus led a raiding party into the Huns&#x27; territory and desecrated their royal tombs. In response to this desecration, Attila demanded that the bishop be handed over. To ensure his own safety, the bishop struck a deal with Attila, surrendering the city of Margus to him in exchange for his own life. With control of Margus, Attila had a foothold across the Danube, which he aggressively exploited, capturing and destroying the cities of Viminacium, Singidunum, and Sirmium. Theodosius recalled Aspar to Constantinople and launched a counter-attack. After his force was decisively defeated, Theodosius undertook to pay tribute to the Huns every year, which he did until his death in 450.

===Accession===
After Theodosius II died unexpectedly in a riding accident on 28 July 450, the Eastern Roman Empire faced its first succession crisis in 60 years. Theodosius had no sons, nor had he designated a successor. Some later sources state that he willed the throne to Marcian on his deathbed, but this is thought to be propaganda created by Marcian&#x27;s supporters after his election. Marcian had served Aspar and his father Ardabur loyally for fifteen years. Aspar conspired to have Marcian elected and was able to negotiate with other powerful figures to have him made the emperor, despite his relative obscurity. There was a one-month interregnum where negotiations for the succession took place, one of which was with Pulcheria, Theodosius II&#x27;s sister, who agreed to marry Marcian; it is thought that Pulcheria agreed to marry Marcian on the condition that he would abandon Theodosius II″s religious policies and convoke a Church council. Their marriage helped to legitimize Marcian&#x27;s rule, as Pulcheria&#x27;s family, the Theodosian dynasty, had direct ties to the throne. Despite being married to Marcian, Pulcheria kept the vow of virginity she had made in 413, at age 14, during her three years of marriage to him.

Historian Doug Lee proposes that negotiations were also needed between Aspar and Flavius Zeno, who was in a similar position of military power. Zeno was given the prestigious rank of patrician upon Marcian&#x27;s ascension in 450, suggesting a deal whereby Zeno was rewarded for supporting Marcian instead of claiming the throne for himself; Zeno would ultimately die within a year of Marcian″s accession. Aspar son, Ardabur, was promoted to command the army of the Prefecture of the East as the new , soon after Marcian&#x27;s accession.

Marcian was elevated on 25 August 450, and Pulcheria&#x27;s agreement to marry him likely boosted Marcian&#x27;s legitimacy further. Marcian took the regnal name of Imperator Caesar Flavius Marcianus Augustus upon his coronation. The election of Marcian in 450 resulted in large changes to eastern imperial policy. Chrysaphius, the eunuch and (guard of the imperial chambers), who had exercised much influence over Theodosius, was either murdered or executed. Both Pulcheria and Zeno were opposed to Chrysaphius&#x27; influence, which may have motivated Marcian&#x27;s actions. Marcian took a tougher stance against the Huns and a more direct role in ecclesiastical affairs. Byzantist Constance Head considers Marcian to be &quot;an independent-minded emperor.&quot; Lee states that Marcian &quot;can appear as a stronger figure than many other fifth-century incumbents of the imperial office&quot;, but notes that &quot;Flavius Zeno and Pulcheria had both been opponents of Chrysaphius, so the changes may be more a reflection of their influence.&quot;

==Reign==
===Conflict with the Huns===

Almost immediately after becoming emperor, Marcian revoked Theodosius&#x27; treaties with Attila and proclaimed the end of subsidies. He stated that he might grant gifts if Attila was friendly, but Attila would be repelled if he attempted to raid the Eastern Roman Empire. At this time Attila was preparing to invade the Western Roman Empire, under the guise of helping Emperor Valentinian III against the Visigoths. Attila reacted angrily to Marcian&#x27;s proposal, demanding tribute, but did not alter his invasion plans. He led his horde from Pannonia in spring 451 into the Western Roman Empire. Flavius Aetius, who was the supreme commander of the Western Roman army as , organized a defense and called upon the Visigoths, Franks, Burgundians, Alans, Saxons, Celtic Armoricans, and other tribal groups numbering about 60,000 to aid him. Attila&#x27;s forces were made up of Gepids, Alans, Sciri, Heruli, Rugians, along with some Franks, Burgundians, and Ostrogoths.

Attila sacked Metz and attempted a siege of Orléans, before meeting Aetius&#x27; forces at the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains, in northeast Gaul. This battle involved around 100,000 men and resulted in very large losses on both sides. After the battle, Attila retreated to the Great Hungarian Plain, and Aetius dismissed his coalition of tribes, sending them back to their own territories. In spring 452, Attila again launched a raid into Italy, which was almost entirely undefended. He was likely motivated by a desire for revenge, along with a need to raid to stabilize his tribal state, which was dependent upon raiding for loot and resources. Attila captured the city of Aquileia after a long and difficult siege, and sacked it. He then raided across northern Italy, taking Mediolanum (Milan) and other important cities. There was much fear that Attila would attack Rome itself, the walls of which were weaker than those of some cities he had already captured. During this period, other than cutting his lines of communication and harassing his rear forces, Aetius did not launch a direct attack on Attila.

Despite the plunder he now had from capturing Aquileia, Milan, and other cities, Attila was quickly placed in a precarious situation, because of the actions of both Eastern and Western Rome. In Italy, he was seriously lacking in funds, having not received subsidies from either Eastern or Western Rome for two years. Constant warfare had depleted his forces. As well, Attila&#x27;s homeland was threatened by the Eastern Empire which, despite the punitive raids he ordered, took the offensive against the Great Hungarian Plain in mid-452, attacking across the Danube and inflicting a defeat upon the Huns. The area attacked by the Eastern Romans was home to Ostrogoths and Gepids, two groups bitterly opposed to Hunnic rule, and was the breadbasket of the Hunnic Empire. The loss of food supply from Attila&#x27;s own land coupled with a famine that Italy was suffering at the time, along with a plague that followed it, placed yet more strain upon Attila, allowing the Western Roman Empire to bribe him into retreating to his homeland. After returning to the Great Hungarian Plain, he threatened to invade the Eastern Empire the following spring and conquer it entirely. Marcian and Aspar ignored his threats. They reasoned, based upon the previous treaties that Attila had broken, that he could not be permanently deterred even by tons of gold. The pair believed the gold would be better spent building up armies, not appeasing threats. Also, the rich Asian and African provinces, which were protected behind Constantinople, were secure enough to allow the Eastern Empire to retake any European provinces it might lose. This campaign never came to fruition, as Attila died unexpectedly in 453, either from hemorrhaging or alcoholic suffocation, after celebrating a marriage to one of his many wives. After his death, his tribal confederation rapidly fell apart, starting first with rebellions of the Ostrogoths.

This fragmentation allowed the Eastern Empire to resume its policy of playing off barbarians against each other, to stop any one tribe from becoming too powerful. It is almost certain that the Gepid king Ardaric came to an agreement with Marcian. Ardaric had formed a coalition of the Rugians, Sciri, Heruli, and his own Gepids, which he led against the remaining Hunnic confederation. Ardaric, alongside the Ostrogoth leaders Theodemir, Valamir and Videmir, decisively defeated Attila&#x27;s oldest son, Ellac, at the Battle of Nedao in 455, where he was slain. After this battle, the Hunnic confederation could no longer sustain the cohesion of its previous days, although they still remained prominent. In the wake of the reduced power of the Hunnic Empire, Marcian accepted the Ostrogoths, who had established themselves in Pannonia Prima and Valeria—nominally two Western Roman provinces—as . This marked the continuation of the tacit abandonment of a rigid Danube barrier, which had previously been manned by Roman , barbarians settled directly in Roman land in exchange for military service. For some time before Marcian, the had been replaced by , although the distinction between the two was increasingly breaking down. Marcian&#x27;s successors would grant the status of to multiple peoples and ceding them lands in the recovered European provinces: the Rugians in eastern Thrace, Sciri in Lower Moesia and Scythia, Gepids in Dacia. This network of subject peoples, who were generally reliable and manageable, was beneficial to the Eastern Empire. The tribal peoples generally kept each other&#x27;s power in check without Roman intervention. They could also be induced to serve the empire against its enemies by way of gifts, subsidies, and treaties. With the Hunnic empire&#x27;s diminished might after the death of Attila, Marcian enjoyed a relatively peaceful reign, although he won some small campaigns against the Saracens in Syria and against the Blemmyes in Egypt.

===Religious policy===

During the 5th century, a central religious issue was the debate concerning how the human and divine nature of Jesus Christ were associated, following the Arian controversy. The School of Alexandria, including theologians such as Athanasius, asserted the equality of Christ and God, and therefore focused upon the divinity of Christ. The School of Antioch, including theologians such as Theodore of Mopsuestia, determined not to lose the human aspect of Christ, focused upon his humanity.

Shortly before Marcian became emperor, the Second Council of Ephesus was held in 449. The council stated that Jesus had one divine united nature, a position called ; this was rejected by the Pope and the Patriarch of Constantinople because of disputes on the matter of Christology, as the Pope and Patriarch of Constantinople saw the belief in miaphysis as heretical.

To repudiate the Second Council of Ephesus, Marcian convened a new council of the imperial church, deemed to pass universally respected canons, in 451. Pulcheria may have influenced this decision or even made the convention of a council a requirement during her negotiations with Aspar to marry Marcian. The council was to take place near Constantinople so that the government could watch the proceedings closely. Initially, it was to be held at the city of Nicaea, which held enormous religious importance to the early church, as it was the site of its first council, the First Council of Nicaea in 325. However, Marcian successfully requested the transfer of the location to Chalcedon. This was closer to Constantinople and would allow him to respond quickly to any events along the Danube frontier. The Council of Chalcedon met in October 451. About 500 bishops attended it, most of them Eastern Roman, although two African bishops and two Papal legates sent by Pope Leo I attended. This council condemned the Second Council of Ephesus and agreed that Jesus had a divine nature () and a human nature, united in one person (), &quot;without confusion, change, division, or separation.&quot;

The council also agreed to condemn the Coptic Pope Dioscorus I of Alexandria, who had overseen the Second Council of Ephesus, and revoke the condemnations of Ibas of Edessa and Theodoret, which had taken place during this council. The council also repeated the importance of the See of Constantinople, placing it firmly in second place behind the See of Rome, and giving it the right to appoint bishops in the Eastern Roman Empire, over the objection of Pope Leo I; the Patriarchs of Alexandria also objected to the elevation of the See of Constantinople. The council ended in November 451, after which Marcian issued numerous edicts confirming the outcomes of the council; showing that the outcome of the council was not universally accepted. One such edict ordered the repression of Eutychianists, who did not believe in the hypostatic union of the two natures of Jesus, barring them from holding state offices, forbidding them from criticizing the Council of Chalcedon, and ordering their literature, along with that of the Nestorians, to be burned.

The anti-Miaphysite resolutions of the council led to a large increase in civil disruption in the eastern provinces of Syria and Egypt, where the majority of the population was Miaphysitic. Several violent revolts were put down with military force after significant bloodshed, in Jerusalem, Alexandria, and Antioch; as well as sending the military to suppress monks in Palestine and placing troops in Alexandria to ensure the installation of Proterius of Alexandria, who was to replace the deposed Pope Dioscorus I. According to the Byzantist Alexander Vasiliev, even after these revolts were put down, the popular dissatisfaction with the state church among the Miaphysite and Nestorian population remained, as the eastern provinces became increasingly convinced of their need for independence from the Eastern Roman Empire. Vasiliev states that this would lead to long-lasting disloyalty toward the Eastern Roman government among the eastern provinces, ultimately facilitating the loss of these provinces to the Sassanians and later to the Arabs. Another result of the council and the subsequent edicts was that many Christians who disagreed with the council, including many Nestorians, migrated to the Sassanian Empire. The separation of the Miaphysites from the churches accepting Chalcedonian doctrine would be made final after the failed attempts of reconciliation under Emperor Justinian I (), the Miaphysites splitting the Oriental Orthodox Churches from the main body of Christians.

Marcian also funded Pulcheria&#x27;s extensive building projects until her death in July 453. All of them focused on the construction of religious buildings, including the Church of St. Mary of Blachernae and the Hodegon Monastery. Marcian was compared to both Paul the Apostle and the Biblical king David, by the legates at the Council of Chalcedon.

===Economic and legal policy===
At the beginning of Marcian&#x27;s reign, the Eastern Roman treasury was almost bankrupt, the result of the huge tributes paid to Attila by Theodosius. Marcian reversed this near bankruptcy, not by levying new taxes, but by cutting expenditure. Upon his accession, he declared a remission of all debts owed to the state. Marcian attempted to improve the efficiency of the state in multiple ways. He laid out legal reforms in his novels, or codes of law, containing 20 laws, many of which were targeted at reducing the corruption and abuses of office that had existed during the reign of Theodosius; five of which are preserved in full.

Marcian mandated that the office of praetorship (officer in charge of public games and works) could only be given to senators who resided in Constantinople, attempted to curb the practice of selling administrative offices, and decreed that consuls should be responsible for the maintenance of Constantinople&#x27;s aqueducts. He repealed the , a tax on senators&#x27; property that amounted to seven pounds of gold per annum. Marcian removed the financial responsibilities of the consuls and praetors, held since the time of the Roman Republic, to fund public sports and games or give wealth to the citizens of Constantinople, respectively. He further decreed that only a (a high-ranking man) could hold either office. He also partially repealed a marriage law enacted by Constantine I, which decreed that a man of senatorial status could not marry a slave, freedwoman, actress, or woman of no social status (), which had been created in an attempt to preserve the purity of the senatorial class. Marcian adjusted this law by declaring that the law should not exclude a woman of good character, regardless of her social status or wealth. By the time of his death, Marcian&#x27;s shrewd cutting of expenditures and his avoidance of large-scale wars left the Eastern Roman treasury with a surplus of of gold.

In 451, Marcian decreed that anyone who performed pagan rites would lose their property and be condemned to death and that no pagan temples, which had previously been closed, could be reopened. To ensure this law was implemented, he set a penalty of of gold for any judge, governor or official who did not enforce the law.

===Politics===

When Marcian became emperor, he was influenced by Flavius Zeno, Pulcheria, and Aspar. Flavius Zeno died soon after Marcian ascended the throne, possibly as early as the end of 451, and Pulcheria died in July 453, leaving Aspar as the only major influence in the court of the Eastern Roman Empire. This influence was enhanced by the promotion of his son Ardabur to . It is unknown if Aspar and Ardabur influenced Marcian″s policies directly, but if so, they were extremely careful to avoid upsetting the ruling elites of Constantinople. Despite Aspar&#x27;s great influence, the Eastern Roman elites retained much of their anti-German sentiment. Marcian&#x27;s principal advisors were Pulcheria, Euphemius the (master of offices), Palladius the praetor, and Anatolius of Constantinople. In 453, Marcian had his daughter from a previous marriage, Marcia Euphemia, marry Anthemius, an aristocrat and talented general.

Marcian patronized the Blues, who were one of the two circus teams, the other being the Greens. The two teams had become more like political parties than sports teams by his time, wielding large influence in the empire; both vied for power. After the Greens responded angrily to his patronage, Marcian censured them, forbidding any of them to hold any public office for three years. Marcian&#x27;s patronage of the Blues may have had personal motivations, as the once powerful Chrysaphius had been favorable to the Greens.

===Foreign relations===
The Armenian king Vardan II Mamikonian, who was leading a revolt against the Sassanian Empire, sent an embassy to Theodosius in 450, composed of his brother Hmayeak Mamikonian, along with Atom Gnuni, Vardan Amatuni, and Meruzhan Artsruni, to ask for assistance. Theodosius received it favorably. Any plans were cut short by his death and the accession of Marcian. Marcian was counseled by the diplomat Anatolius and Florentius not to make war with the Sassanians, as it would engulf a large amount of the Eastern Roman military resources, and thus Marcian did not agree to help them.

King Gubazes I of Lazica—a Caucasian state in theory under Eastern Roman suzerainty—was attempting to form an alliance with the Sassanians to break free of Roman control in 456. Marcian&#x27;s troops invaded Lazica and restored Roman rule. In 455, Marcian banned the export to barbarian tribes of weapons and the tools used to manufacture them.

===Relationship with the Western Roman Empire===
Marcian was elected without any consultation with the Western Roman Emperor Valentinian III, a clear indication of further separation between the Eastern and Western Roman Empires than before his reign. Valentinian would later recognize Marcian as the Eastern Roman Emperor, although the date of this recognition is disputed; Lee states that Valentinian recognized Marcian in March 452, whereas historian Timothy E. Gregory states that Marcian was recognized by Valentinian on 30 March 451. Marcian″s appointment marked a further stage of separation between the Eastern and Western Roman Empires. One source, John of Antioch&#x27;s , even suggest that Valentinian would have attempted to depose Marcian, but for Aetius″ opposition. Valentinian also did not recognize the Eastern Roman consuls for 451 or 452. The Western Roman chronicler Hydatius suggests that Marcian made Eastern Roman troops available to Valentinian to repel the Huns, confusingly led by a man named Aetius, which may simply be a muddling of Aetius&#x27; campaign against Attila and Marcian&#x27;s campaign against the Huns on the Danube.

When Marcian granted part of Pannonia to the Ostrogoths, and the Tisza region to the Gepids, he was accused of encroaching upon the border of Western Roman land. Marcian avoided involving himself with the affairs of the Western Roman Empire when possible. When the Vandals sacked Rome in 455, after Petronius Maximus assassinated Valentinian III and broke an engagement treaty with the Vandals, Marcian did not respond violently, possibly because of the influence of Aspar. He merely sent an envoy demanding that the Vandals return the Dowager Empress, Licinia Eudoxia and her daughters by Valentinian III, Placidia and Eudocia. A likely false account is given that Marcian, while captured by the Vandals in his youth, was shaded by an eagle while the other prisoners suffered the hot sun. According to this account, the Vandal King Gaiseric recognized that Marcian would later be emperor. In exchange for being released, he made Marcian pledge not to attack the Vandals should he become emperor. This account originates from Priscus, who served as an advisor to Marcian&#x27;s confidant, Euphemius. Because of Euphemius&#x27; influence over foreign policy, some historians, such as Edward Arthur Thompson, have suggested that this account was a part of official imperial propaganda, which was generated to excuse Marcian&#x27;s lack of retribution towards the Vandals, and quell any discontent. Marcian made several diplomatic attempts to have the prisoners returned, before finally beginning to plan an invasion of the Vandal&#x27;s territory shortly before his death. The historian Frank Clover has suggested that this sudden reversal of policy was caused by the marriage of Eudocia to Huneric, the son of Gaiseric, which led to such pressure from Eastern Roman elites that Marcian was forced to begin preparations for war to ensure the return of the hostages. Around this time, Marcian made peace with Lazica, which would allow him to direct his attention elsewhere. The East Roman historian Theodorus Lector speaks of Marcian&#x27;s sudden reversal of policy, and Evagrius Scholasticus, a Roman historian writing a century after the event, states that the Vandals released Licinia Eudoxia, Placidia, and Eudocia to Marcian after he threatened them with war, in either late 456 or early 457.

Marcian did not recognize any Western Emperor after Valentinian, denying Petronius Maximus, now Western Emperor, when he sent an embassy requesting it, and similarly refusing to recognize Avitus, who succeeded Maximus. Marcian&#x27;s exact treatment of Avitus is debated. The Roman historian Hydatius states that in 455 Avitus sent ambassadors to Marcian &quot;for the sake of unanimity of power,&quot; and that, &quot;Marcian and Avitus make use of Roman power in concord&quot;. The exact usage of concord ( in the original Latin) has led to debate among scholars. Some such as Thomas Hodgkin, J. B. Bury, and William Bayless consider it grounds for the belief that Marcian may have recognized Avitus. Most scholars take a more conservative stance on it; Ernst Stein suggests that it is merely a reflection of West Roman propaganda, whereas Norman Baynes believes it indicates that Marcian was cordial to Avitus, neither hostile nor friendly. Classicist Courtenay Edward Stevens interprets the phrase as meaning only that the meeting of the diplomats was amicable, rather than reflecting a relationship between the two states.

The historian Geoffrey Nathan suggests the fact that only two Western delegates attended the Council of Chalcedon points to a new level of Western Roman self-absorption in their own political and religious affairs. He mentions that the canon from this council delegating authority over the whole east to the See of Constantinople marks a religious separation. Authority over the Church in the Eastern Roman Empire would prove a point of contention between Rome and Constantinople, leading up to the East–West Schism.

==Death==

Marcian&#x27;s reign ended on 27 January 457, when he died, aged 65, possibly of gangrene. Theodorus Lector and Theophanes the Confessor say that Marcian died after a long religious procession from the Grand Palace to the Hebdomon, where he made the journey on foot, despite the fact that he could barely walk because of severe foot inflammation, possibly gout. He was buried in the Church of the Holy Apostles, in Constantinople, next to his wife Pulcheria, in a porphyry sarcophagus that was described in the 10th century by Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus in the . He left the Eastern Empire with seven million solidi in its treasury, an impressive achievement considering the economic ruin inflicted upon Eastern Rome by the Huns, both through warfare and the massive subsidies they received under Theodosius.

Although Marcian had a son-in-law, Anthemius, he did not have any connection to the Theodosians, which Marcian himself had gained through his marriage to Pulcheria, and thus would not be considered a legitimate dynastic heir, so Aspar was once again left to play the role of emperor-maker. He selected Leo I, a fifty-year-old officer commanding a unit in one of the praesental armies—two field armies based near Constantinople. A later source claims that the Eastern Roman Senate offered to elect Aspar himself, but he declined, with the cryptic comment: &quot;I fear that a tradition in ruling might be initiated through me&quot;. This comment has often been interpreted to be a reference to the fact that he was an Arian, or else to his Alanic heritage.

Anthemius would later be sent by Leo to become the Western Roman emperor; Leo nominated him to be Western Emperor in the spring of 467, to fill the vacancy left by the death of Emperor Libius Severus since 465. Leo sent Anthemius to Rome with an army, headed by Marcellinus, the of Dalmatia; upon nearing Rome, Anthemius was installed as emperor on 12 April 467.

==Legacy==

Marcian was regarded favorably by Eastern Roman and Byzantine sources, often compared to Emperors Constantine I and Theodosius I. Marcian&#x27;s reign was seen by many later Byzantine writers, such as Theophanes the Confessor, as a golden age: Marcian secured the Eastern Empire both politically and financially, set an orthodox religious line that future emperors would follow, and stabilized the capital city politically. Some later scholars attribute his success not just to his skill, but also to a large degree of luck. Not only had he been fortunate enough to have Pulcheria to legitimize his rule, but for much of it the two greatest external threats to Rome, the Sassanian Empire and the Huns, were absorbed with their own internal problems. Further, no natural disasters or plagues occurred during his reign. He was remembered fondly by the people of Constantinople, who would shout &quot;Reign like Marcian!&quot; at the installation of future emperors.

The Prefect of Constantinople Tatianus built a column dedicated to Marcian, sometime between 450 and 452. It still stands in Istanbul, near the north branch of the Mese, though the statue of Marcian that originally topped it has been lost. Marcian also had a statue in the Forum of Arcadius, which contained the statues of several of the successors of Emperor Arcadius. Marcian may have been the sponsor of the Chrysotriklinos of the Great Palace of Constantinople. The states that Marcian constructed it, whereas the 10th century encyclopedia states that Emperor Justin II built it, a view with which most historians agree. The Byzantine historian Joannes Zonaras states that Justin II actually rebuilt an older construction, which some historians identify as the Heptaconch Hall of Emperor Justinian.

==In popular culture==
Marcian is played by the Hollywood star Jeff Chandler in the 1954 period adventure &quot;Sign of the Pagan&quot;. Jack Palance co-stars as Attila and Ludmilla Tchérina plays Pulcheria.

<doc id="53741" wikidata="Q12485" url="?curid=53741" title="Symmetry">
<text>Symmetry () in everyday life refers to a sense of harmonious and beautiful proportion and balance. In mathematics, the term has a more precise definition and is usually used to refer to an object that is invariant under some transformations, such as translation, reflection, rotation, or scaling. Although these two meanings of the word can sometimes be told apart, they are intricately related, and hence are discussed together in this article.

Mathematical symmetry may be observed with respect to the passage of time; as a spatial relationship; through geometric transformations; through other kinds of functional transformations; and as an aspect of abstract objects, including theoretic models, language, and music.

This article describes symmetry from three perspectives: in mathematics, including geometry, the most familiar type of symmetry for many people; in science and nature; and in the arts, covering architecture, art, and music.

The opposite of symmetry is asymmetry, which refers to the absence of symmetry.

==In mathematics==

===In geometry===

A geometric shape or object is symmetric if it can be divided into two or more identical pieces that are arranged in an organized fashion. This means that an object is symmetric if there is a transformation that moves individual pieces of the object, but doesn&#x27;t change the overall shape. The type of symmetry is determined by the way the pieces are organized, or by the type of transformation:

* An object has reflectional symmetry (line or mirror symmetry) if there is a line (or in 3D a plane) going through it which divides it into two pieces that are mirror images of each other.
*An object has rotational symmetry if the object can be rotated about a fixed point (or in 3D about a line) without changing the overall shape.
*An object has translational symmetry if it can be translated (moving every point of the object by the same distance) without changing its overall shape.
*An object has helical symmetry if it can be simultaneously translated and rotated in three-dimensional space along a line known as a screw axis.
*An object has scale symmetry if it does not change shape when it is expanded or contracted. Fractals also exhibit a form of scale symmetry, where smaller portions of the fractal are similar in shape to larger portions.
*Other symmetries include glide reflection symmetry (a reflection followed by a translation) and rotoreflection symmetry (a combination of a rotation and a reflection).

===In logic===

A dyadic relation &quot;R&quot; = &quot;S&quot; × &quot;S&quot; is symmetric if for all elements &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; in &quot;S&quot;, whenever it is true that &quot;Rab&quot;, it is also true that &quot;Rba&quot;. Thus, the relation &quot;is the same age as&quot; is symmetric, for if Paul is the same age as Mary, then Mary is the same age as Paul.

In propositional logic, symmetric binary logical connectives include &quot;and&quot; (∧, or &amp;), &quot;or&quot; (∨, or |) and &quot;if and only if&quot; (↔), while the connective &quot;if&quot; (→) is not symmetric. Other symmetric logical connectives include &quot;nand&quot; (not-and, or ⊼), &quot;xor&quot; (not-biconditional, or ⊻), and &quot;nor&quot; (not-or, or ⊽).

===Other areas of mathematics===

Generalizing from geometrical symmetry in the previous section, one can say that a mathematical object is &quot;symmetric&quot; with respect to a given mathematical operation, if, when applied to the object, this operation preserves some property of the object. The set of operations that preserve a given property of the object form a group.

In general, every kind of structure in mathematics will have its own kind of symmetry. Examples include even and odd functions in calculus, symmetric groups in abstract algebra, symmetric matrices in linear algebra, and Galois groups in Galois theory. In statistics, symmetry also manifests as symmetric probability distributions, and as skewness—the asymmetry of distributions.

==In science and nature==
===In physics===
Symmetry in physics has been generalized to mean invariance—that is, lack of change—under any kind of transformation, for example arbitrary coordinate transformations. This concept has become one of the most powerful tools of theoretical physics, as it has become evident that practically all laws of nature originate in symmetries. In fact, this role inspired the Nobel laureate PW Anderson to write in his widely read 1972 article &quot;More is Different&quot; that &quot;it is only slightly overstating the case to say that physics is the study of symmetry.&quot; See Noether&#x27;s theorem (which, in greatly simplified form, states that for every continuous mathematical symmetry, there is a corresponding conserved quantity such as energy or momentum; a conserved current, in Noether&#x27;s original language); and also, Wigner&#x27;s classification, which says that the symmetries of the laws of physics determine the properties of the particles found in nature.

Important symmetries in physics include continuous symmetries and discrete symmetries of spacetime; internal symmetries of particles; and supersymmetry of physical theories.

===In biology===
In biology, the notion of symmetry is mostly used explicitly to describe body shapes. Bilateral animals, including humans, are more or less symmetric with respect to the sagittal plane which divides the body into left and right halves. Animals that move in one direction necessarily have upper and lower sides, head and tail ends, and therefore a left and a right. The head becomes specialized with a mouth and sense organs, and the body becomes bilaterally symmetric for the purpose of movement, with symmetrical pairs of muscles and skeletal elements, though internal organs often remain asymmetric.

Plants and sessile (attached) animals such as sea anemones often have radial or rotational symmetry, which suits them because food or threats may arrive from any direction. Fivefold symmetry is found in the echinoderms, the group that includes starfish, sea urchins, and sea lilies.

In biology, the notion of symmetry is also used as in physics, that is to say to describe the properties of the objects studied, including their interactions. A remarkable property of biological evolution is the changes of symmetry corresponding to the appearance of new parts and dynamics.

===In chemistry===
Symmetry is important to chemistry because it undergirds essentially all &quot;specific&quot; interactions between molecules in nature (i.e., via the interaction of natural and human-made chiral molecules with inherently chiral biological systems). The control of the symmetry of molecules produced in modern chemical synthesis contributes to the ability of scientists to offer therapeutic interventions with minimal side effects. A rigorous understanding of symmetry explains fundamental observations in quantum chemistry, and in the applied areas of spectroscopy and crystallography. The theory and application of symmetry to these areas of physical science draws heavily on the mathematical area of group theory.

===In psychology and neuroscience===
For a human observer, some symmetry types are more salient than others, in particular the most salient is a reflection with a vertical axis, like that present in the human face. Ernst Mach made this observation in his book &quot;The analysis of sensations&quot; (1897), and this implies that perception of symmetry is not a general response to all types of regularities. Both behavioural and neurophysiological studies have confirmed the special sensitivity to reflection symmetry in humans and also in other animals. Early studies within the Gestalt tradition suggested that bilateral symmetry was one of the key factors in perceptual grouping. This is known as the Law of Symmetry. The role of symmetry in grouping and figure/ground organization has been confirmed in many studies. For instance, detection of reflectional symmetry is faster when this is a property of a single object. Studies of human perception and psychophysics have shown that detection of symmetry is fast, efficient and robust to perturbations. For example, symmetry can be detected with presentations between 100 and 150 milliseconds.

More recent neuroimaging studies have documented which brain regions are active during perception of symmetry. Sasaki et al. used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to compare responses for patterns with symmetrical or random dots. A strong activity was present in extrastriate regions of the occipital cortex but not in the primary visual cortex. The extrastriate regions included V3A, V4, V7, and the lateral occipital complex (LOC). Electrophysiological studies have found a late posterior negativity that originates from the same areas. In general, a large part of the visual system seems to be involved in processing visual symmetry, and these areas involve similar networks to those responsible for detecting and recognising objects.

==In social interactions==
People observe the symmetrical nature, often including asymmetrical balance, of social interactions in a variety of contexts. These include assessments of reciprocity, empathy, sympathy, apology, dialogue, respect, justice, and revenge.
Reflective equilibrium is the balance that may be attained through deliberative mutual adjustment among general principles and specific judgments.
Symmetrical interactions send the moral message &quot;we are all the same&quot; while asymmetrical interactions may send the message &quot;I am special; better than you.&quot; Peer relationships, such as can be governed by the Golden Rule, are based on symmetry, whereas power relationships are based on asymmetry. Symmetrical relationships can to some degree be maintained by simple (game theory) strategies seen in symmetric games such as tit for tat.

==In the arts==
There exists a list of journals and newsletters known to deal, at least in part, with symmetry and the arts.

===In architecture===

Symmetry finds its ways into architecture at every scale, from the overall external views of buildings such as Gothic cathedrals and The White House, through the layout of the individual floor plans, and down to the design of individual building elements such as tile mosaics. Islamic buildings such as the Taj Mahal and the Lotfollah mosque make elaborate use of symmetry both in their structure and in their ornamentation. Moorish buildings like the Alhambra are ornamented with complex patterns made using translational and reflection symmetries as well as rotations.

It has been said that only bad architects rely on a &quot;symmetrical layout of blocks, masses and structures&quot;; Modernist architecture, starting with International style, relies instead on &quot;wings and balance of masses&quot;.

===In pottery and metal vessels===
Since the earliest uses of pottery wheels to help shape clay vessels, pottery has had a strong relationship to symmetry. Pottery created using a wheel acquires full rotational symmetry in its cross-section, while allowing substantial freedom of shape in the vertical direction. Upon this inherently symmetrical starting point, potters from ancient times onwards have added patterns that modify the rotational symmetry to achieve visual objectives.

Cast metal vessels lacked the inherent rotational symmetry of wheel-made pottery, but otherwise provided a similar opportunity to decorate their surfaces with patterns pleasing to those who used them. The ancient Chinese, for example, used symmetrical patterns in their bronze castings as early as the 17th century BC. Bronze vessels exhibited both a bilateral main motif and a repetitive translated border design.

===In carpets and rugs===
A long tradition of the use of symmetry in carpet and rug patterns spans a variety of cultures. American Navajo Indians used bold diagonals and rectangular motifs. Many Oriental rugs have intricate reflected centers and borders that translate a pattern. Not surprisingly, rectangular rugs have typically the symmetries of a rectangle—that is, motifs that are reflected across both the horizontal and vertical axes (see ).

===In quilts===
As quilts are made from square blocks (usually 9, 16, or 25 pieces to a block) with each smaller piece usually consisting of fabric triangles, the craft lends itself readily to the application of symmetry.

===In other arts and crafts===
Symmetries appear in the design of objects of all kinds. Examples include beadwork, furniture, sand paintings, knotwork, masks, and musical instruments. Symmetries are central to the art of M.C. Escher and the many applications of tessellation in art and craft forms such as wallpaper, ceramic tilework such as in Islamic geometric decoration, batik, ikat, carpet-making, and many kinds of textile and embroidery patterns.

Symmetry is also used in designing logos. By creating a logo on a grid and using the theory of symmetry, designers can organize their work, create a symmetric or asymmetrical design, determine the space between letters, determine how much negative space is required in the design, and how to accentuate parts of the logo to make it stand out.

===In music===
Symmetry is not restricted to the visual arts. Its role in the history of music touches many aspects of the creation and perception of music.

====Musical form====

Symmetry has been used as a formal constraint by many composers, such as the arch (swell) form (ABCBA) used by Steve Reich, Béla Bartók, and James Tenney. In classical music, Johann Sebastian Bach used the symmetry concepts of permutation and invariance.

====Pitch structures====
Symmetry is also an important consideration in the formation of scales and chords, traditional or tonal music being made up of non-symmetrical groups of pitches, such as the diatonic scale or the major chord. Symmetrical scales or chords, such as the whole tone scale, augmented chord, or diminished seventh chord (diminished-diminished seventh), are said to lack direction or a sense of forward motion, are ambiguous as to the key or tonal center, and have a less specific diatonic functionality. However, composers such as Alban Berg, Béla Bartók, and George Perle have used axes of symmetry and/or interval cycles in an analogous way to keys or non-tonal tonal centers. George Perle explains that &quot;C–E, D–F♯, [and] Eb–G, are different instances of the same interval … the other kind of identity. … has to do with axes of symmetry. C–E belongs to a family of symmetrically related dyads as follows:&quot;

Thus in addition to being part of the interval-4 family, C–E is also a part of the sum-4 family (with C equal to 0).

Interval cycles are symmetrical and thus non-diatonic. However, a seven pitch segment of C5 (the cycle of fifths, which are enharmonic with the cycle of fourths) will produce the diatonic major scale. Cyclic tonal progressions in the works of Romantic composers such as Gustav Mahler and Richard Wagner form a link with the cyclic pitch successions in the atonal music of Modernists such as Bartók, Alexander Scriabin, Edgard Varèse, and the Vienna school. At the same time, these progressions signal the end of tonality.

The first extended composition consistently based on symmetrical pitch relations was probably Alban Berg&#x27;s &quot;Quartet&quot;, Op. 3 (1910).

====Equivalency====

Tone rows or pitch class sets which are invariant under retrograde are horizontally symmetrical, under inversion vertically. See also Asymmetric rhythm.

===In aesthetics===
The relationship of symmetry to aesthetics is complex. Humans find bilateral symmetry in faces physically attractive; it indicates health and genetic fitness. Opposed to this is the tendency for excessive symmetry to be perceived as boring or uninteresting. Rudolf Arnheim suggested that people prefer shapes that have some symmetry, and enough complexity to make them interesting.

===In literature===
Symmetry can be found in various forms in literature, a simple example being the palindrome where a brief text reads the same forwards or backwards. Stories may have a symmetrical structure, such as the rise and fall pattern of &quot;Beowulf&quot;.

<text>Alexander B. H. Cox (born 15 December 1954) is an English film director, screenwriter, actor, non-fiction author and broadcaster. Cox experienced success early in his career with &quot;Repo Man&quot; (1984) and &quot;Sid and Nancy&quot; (1986). Since the release and commercial failure of &quot;Walker&quot; (1987), his career has moved towards independent films, including &quot;Highway Patrolman&quot; (1991) and &quot;Three Businessmen&quot; (1998), and microbudget features such as &quot;Searchers 2.0&quot; (2007) and &quot;Repo Chick&quot; (2009). 

Cox has taught screenwriting and film production at the University of Colorado, Boulder and has written numerous educational books on film and television.

==Early life==
Cox was born in Bebington, Merseyside, England in 1954. He attended Worcester College, Oxford, and later transferred to the University of Bristol where he majored in film studies. Cox secured a Fulbright Scholarship, allowing him to study at the University of California, Los Angeles, United States, where he graduated from the School of Theater, Film and Television with an MFA.

==Film career==
=== Study and independent ===
Cox began reading law as an undergraduate at Oxford University, but left to study radio, film and TV at Bristol University, graduating in 1977. Seeing difficulties in the British film scene at the time, he first went to Los Angeles to attend film school at UCLA in 1977. There he produced his first film, &quot;Edge City&quot; (also known as &quot;Sleep Is for Sissies&quot;), a 40-minute surreal short about an artist struggling against society. After graduation, Cox formed Edge City Productions with two friends with the intention of producing low-budget feature films. He wrote a screenplay for &quot;Repo Man&quot;, which he hoped to produce for a budget of $70,000, and began seeking funding.

===Hollywood and major studio period (1978–1987)===
Michael Nesmith agreed to produce &quot;Repo Man&quot;, and convinced Universal Studios to back the project with a budget of over a million dollars. During the course of the film&#x27;s production, the studio&#x27;s management changed, and the new management had far less faith in the project. The initial cinema release was limited to Chicago, followed by Los Angeles, and was short-lived.

After the success of the soundtrack album (notable for featuring many popular LA punk bands), there was enough interest in the film to earn a re-release in a single cinema in New York City, but only after becoming available on video and cable. Nevertheless, it ran for 18 months, and eventually earned $4,000,000.

Continuing his fascination with punk music, Cox&#x27;s next film was an independent feature shot in London and Los Angeles, following the career and death of bassist Sid Vicious and his girlfriend Nancy Spungen, initially titled &quot;Love Kills&quot; and later renamed &quot;Sid and Nancy&quot;. It was met warmly by critics and fans, though heavily criticised by some, including Pistols&#x27; frontman John Lydon, for its inaccuracies. The production of this film also sparked a relationship with Joe Strummer of the Clash, who would continue to collaborate with the director on his next two films.

Cox had long been interested in Nicaragua and the Sandinistas (both &quot;Repo Man&quot; and &quot;Edge City&quot; made references to Nicaragua and/or Latin American revolution), and visited in 1984. The following year, he hoped to shoot a concert film there featuring the Clash, the Pogues and Elvis Costello. When he could not get backing, he decided instead to write a film that they would all act in. The film became &quot;Straight to Hell&quot;. Collaborating with Dick Rude (who also co-starred beside Strummer, Sy Richardson and Courtney Love), he imagined the film as a spoof of the Spaghetti Western genre, filmed in Almería, Spain, where many classic Italian westerns were shot. &quot;Straight to Hell&quot; was widely panned critically, but successful in Japan and retains a cult following. On 1 June 2012, Cox wrote an article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; about his long-standing interest in spaghetti westerns.

Continuing his interest in Nicaragua, Cox took on a more overtly political project, with the intention of filming it there. He asked Rudy Wurlitzer to pen the screenplay, which followed the life of William Walker, set against a backdrop of anachronisms that drew parallels between the story and modern American intervention in the area. The $6,000,000 production was backed by Universal, but the completed film was too political and too violent for the studio&#x27;s tastes, and the film went without promotion. When &quot;Walker&quot; failed to perform at the box office, it ended the director&#x27;s involvement with Hollywood studios, and led to a period of several years in which Cox would not direct a single film. Despite this, Cox and some critics maintain that it is his best film.

===Mexican period (1988–1996)===
In 1988, The Writers Guild of America West barred Cox from any future membership because he had worked on scripts during the writers’ strike. Effectively blacklisted, Alex Cox struggled to find feature work. He finally got financial backing for a feature from investors in Japan, where his films had been successful on video. Cox had scouted locations in Mexico during the pre-production of &quot;Walker&quot; and decided he wanted to shoot a film there, with a local cast and crew, in Spanish. Producer Lorenzo O&#x27;Brien penned the script. Inspired by the style of Mexican directors including Arturo Ripstein, he shot most of the film in &quot;plano secuencia&quot;; long, continuous takes shot with a hand-held camera. &quot;El Patrullero&quot; was completed and released in 1991, but struggled to find its way into cinemas.

Shortly after this, Cox was invited to adapt a Jorge Luis Borges story of his choice for the BBC. He chose &quot;Death and the Compass&quot;. Despite being a British production and an English language film, he convinced his producers to let him shoot in Mexico City. This film, like his previous Mexican production, made extensive use of long-takes. The completed 55-minute film aired on the BBC in 1992.

Cox had hoped to expand this into a feature-length film, but the BBC was uninterested. Japanese investors gave him $100,000 to expand the film in 1993, but the production ran over-budget, allowing no funds for post-production. To secure funds, Cox directed a &quot;work for hire&quot; project called &quot;The Winner&quot;. The film was edited extensively without Cox&#x27;s knowledge, and he tried to have his name removed from the credits as a result but was denied, but the money was enough for Cox to fund the completion of &quot;Death and the Compass&quot;. The finished, 82-minute feature received a limited cinema release in the US, where the TV version had not aired, in 1996.

===Liverpool period (1997–2006)===
In 1996, producer Stephen Nemeth employed Alex Cox to write and direct an adaptation of Hunter S. Thompson&#x27;s &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot;. After creative disagreements with the producer and Thompson, he was sacked from the project, and his script rewritten when Terry Gilliam took over the film. (Cox later sued successfully for a writing credit, as it was ruled that there were enough similarities between the drafts to suggest that Gilliam&#x27;s was derivative of Cox&#x27;s. Gilliam countered that the screenplays were based on the source book and similarities between them were a consequence of this.)

In 1997, Alex Cox made a deal with Dutch producer Wim Kayzer to produce another dual TV/feature production. &quot;Three Businessmen&quot;. Initially, Cox had hoped to shoot in Mexico but later decided to set his story in Liverpool, Rotterdam, Tokyo and Almería. The story follows businessmen in Liverpool who leave their hotel in search of food and slowly drift further from their starting point, all the while believing they are still in Liverpool. The film was completed for a small budget of $250,000. Following this, Cox moved back to Liverpool and became interested in creating films there.

Cox had long been interested in the Jacobean play, &quot;The Revenger&#x27;s Tragedy&quot;, and upon moving back to Britain, decided to pursue adapting it to a film. Collaborating with fellow Liverpudlian screenwriter Frank Cottrell Boyce, the story was recast in the near future, following an unseen war. This adaptation, titled &quot;Revengers Tragedy&quot;, consisted primarily of the original play&#x27;s dialogue, with some additional bits written in a more modern tone. The film is also notable for its soundtrack, composed by Chumbawamba.

Following this, Cox directed a short film set in Liverpool for the BBC titled &quot;I&#x27;m a Juvenile Delinquent – Jail Me!&quot; (2004). The 30-minute film satirised reality television as well as the high volume of petty crime in Liverpool which, according to Cox, is largely recreational.

===Microfeature period (2007–present)===
In 2006, Alex Cox tried to get funding for a series of eight very low budget features set in Liverpool and produced by locals. The project was not completed, but the director grew interested in pursuing the idea of a film made for less than £100,000. He had originally hoped to shoot &quot;Repo Man&quot; on a comparable budget, and hoped that the lower overhead would mean greater creative freedom.

&quot;Searchers 2.0&quot;, named after but based on &quot;The Searchers&quot;, became Cox&#x27;s first film for which he has sole writing credit since &quot;Repo Man&quot;, and marked his return to the comedy genre. A road movie and a revenge story, it tells of two actors, loosely based on and played by Del Zamora and Ed Pansullo, who travel from Los Angeles to a desert film screening in Monument Valley in the hopes of avenging abuse inflicted on them by a cruel screenwriter, Fritz Frobisher (Sy Richardson). It was scored by longtime collaborator Dan Wool aka Pray for Rain (&quot;Sid &amp; Nancy&quot;, &quot;Straight to Hell&quot;, &quot;Death &amp; the Compass&quot;, &quot;The Winner&quot;, &quot;Three Businessmen&quot;, &quot;Repo Chick&quot; among others). Although the film was unable to achieve a cinema release in America or Europe, Cox claimed the experience of making a film with a smaller crew and less restrictions was energising. It is available on DVD in Japan, and was released in October 2010 in North America.

Alex Cox had attempted to get a &quot;Repo Man&quot; sequel, titled &quot;Waldo&#x27;s Hawaiian Holiday&quot;, produced in the mid-&#x27;90s, but the project fell apart, with the script adapted into a graphic novel of the same name. For his next micro-feature, he wrote a fresh attempt at a &quot;Repo&quot; follow-up, although it contained no recurring characters, so as to preserve Universal&#x27;s rights to the original. &quot;Repo Chick&quot; was filmed entirely against a green screen, with backgrounds of digital composites, live action shots, and miniatures matted in afterwards, to produce an artificial look. It premiered at the Venice Film Festival on 9 September 2009.

, Cox was teaching film production and screenwriting at the University of Colorado at Boulder.

In 2013 Cox directed &quot;Bill, the Galactic Hero&quot;, developed from a science fiction book by Harry Harrison. It was funded by a successful Kickstarter funding campaign, raising $114,957 of the original $100,000 goal. The film was to be made, created and acted by his film students in monochrome with supervision from professional film makers who would be giving their time on the film for free.

Cox&#x27;s 2013 book &quot;The President and the Provocateur&quot; examines events in the lives of John F. Kennedy and Lee Harvey Oswald leading up to Kennedy&#x27;s assassination, with reference to the various conspiracy theories.

In 2017 Cox directed another crowdfunded film, &quot;Tombstone Rashomon&quot;, which tells the tale of the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral from multiple perspectives in the style of Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s 1950 film &quot;Rashomon&quot;.

In September 2019, Cox started the podcast ‘Conversations with Cox and Kjølseth’ with his friend and colleague Pablo Kjølseth. In October 2022, Cox announced the end of the podcast, citing its small audience and the comparative success of podcasts by Joe Dante, Quentin Tarantino and Cox&#x27;s one-time collaborator Roger Deakins.

In June 2024 Cox began crowdfunding a film adaptation of Nikolai Gogol&#x27;s novel &quot;Dead Souls&quot;, which he says will be his last film.

==&quot;Moviedrome&quot;==
In May 1988 Cox began presenting the long-running and influential BBC series &quot;Moviedrome&quot;. The weekly strand was a showcase for cult films. Though most of the films shown were chosen by series creator and producer Nick Jones, each film was introduced by Cox. By the time he left the show in September 1994, Cox had introduced 141 films. Various film directors have cited &quot;Moviedrome&quot; as an influence, including Ben Wheatley and Edgar Wright. The series was later presented by film director and critic Mark Cousins.

==Influences and style==
Cox has cited Luis Buñuel and Akira Kurosawa as influences, as well as the Western film directors Sergio Leone, Sergio Corbucci, Sam Peckinpah, John Ford and Giulio Questi. Cox also wrote a book on the history of the genre called &quot;10,000 Ways to Die&quot;. While he once directed films for Universal Pictures, such as &quot;Repo Man&quot; and &quot;Walker&quot;, since the late 1980s, he has found himself on a self-described blacklist, and turned to producing independent films. Cox is an atheist and is decidedly left-wing in his political views. Many of his films have an explicit anti-capitalist theme or message. He was originally set to direct &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot; but was replaced by Terry Gilliam due to creative differences with Hunter S. Thompson. By August 2009, Cox had announced completion of &quot;Repo Chick&quot;, which premiered at the Venice Film Festival the following month, but he remained ambivalent as to whether the film would ever be distributed to cinemas. His previous film, &quot;Searchers 2.0&quot;, was not released theatrically, and only appears on DVD in Japan and North America after a televised screening in the UK on the BBC.

Cox is a fan of the Japanese &quot;Godzilla&quot; films and appeared in a 1998 BBC documentary highlighting the series. He also narrated the documentary &quot;Bringing Godzilla Down to Size&quot; and wrote the &quot;Godzilla in Time&quot; comics for Dark Horse. He tried to direct an American &quot;Godzilla&quot; film at one point, but unsuccessfully submitted his outline to TriStar Pictures.

==Personal life==
As of 2011, Cox resided in Colestin, Oregon, United States, with his wife, writer Todelina Babish Davies.

<text>Cash flow, in general, refers to payments made into or out of a business, project, or financial product. It can also refer more specifically to a real or virtual movement of money.
*Cash flow, in its narrow sense, is a payment (in a currency), especially from one central bank account to another. The term &#x27;cash flow&#x27; is mostly used to describe payments that are expected to happen in the future, are thus uncertain, and therefore need to be forecast with cash flows.
*A cash flow is determined by its time , nominal amount , currency , and account ; symbolically, .

Cash flows are narrowly interconnected with the concepts of value, interest rate, and liquidity. A cash flow that shall happen on a future day can be transformed into a cash flow of the same value in . This transformation process is known as discounting, and it takes into account the time value of money by adjusting the nominal amount of the cash flow based on the prevailing interest rates at the time.

==Cash flow analysis==

Cash flows are often transformed into measures that give information e.g. on a company&#x27;s value and situation:

*to determine a project&#x27;s rate of return or value. The time of cash flows into and out of projects are used as inputs in financial models such as internal rate of return and net present value.
*to determine problems with a business&#x27;s liquidity. Being profitable does not necessarily mean being liquid. A company can fail because of a shortage of cash even while profitable.
*as an alternative measure of a business&#x27;s profits when it is believed that accrual accounting concepts do not represent economic realities. For instance, a company may be notionally profitable but generating little operational cash (as may be the case for a company that barters its products rather than selling for cash). In such a case, the company may be deriving additional operating cash by issuing shares or raising additional debt finance.
*cash flow can be used to evaluate the &#x27;quality&#x27; of income generated by accrual accounting. When net income is composed of large non-cash items it is considered low quality.
*to evaluate the risks within a financial product, e.g., matching cash requirements, evaluating default risk, re-investment requirements, etc.

Cash flow notion is based loosely on cash flow statement accounting standards. The term is flexible and can refer to time intervals spanning over past-future. It can refer to the total of all flows involved or a subset of those flows.

Within cash flow analysis, 3 types of cash flow are present and used for the cash flow statement: 
*Cash flow from operating activities - a measure of the cash generated by a company&#x27;s regular business operations. Operating cash flow indicates whether a company can produce sufficient cash flow to cover current expenses and pay debts.
*Cash flow from investing activities - the amount of cash generated from investing activities such as purchasing physical assets, investments in securities, or the sale of securities or assets. 
*Cash flow from financing activities - the net flows of cash that are used to fund the company. This includes transactions involving dividends, equity, and debt.

==Business&#x27; financials==

The (total) net cash flow of a company over a period (typically a quarter, half year, or a full year) is equal to the change in cash balance over this period: positive if the cash balance increases (more cash becomes available), negative if the cash balance decreases. The total net cash flow for a project is the sum of cash flows that are classified in three areas:

* Operational cash flows: cash received or expended as a result of the company&#x27;s internal business activities. Operating cash flow of a project is determined by:
**OCF = incremental earnings+depreciation=(earning before interest and tax−tax)+depreciation
**OCF = earning before interest and tax*(1−tax rate)+ depreciation
**OCF = (revenue − cost of good sold − operating expense − depreciation)* (1−tax rate)+depreciation
**OCF = (Revenue − cost of good sold − operating expense)* (1−tax rate)+ depreciation* (tax rate)

Depreciation*(tax rate) which locates at the end of the formula is called depreciation shield through which we can see that there is a negative relation between depreciation and cash flow.

* Changing in net working capital: it is the cost or revenue related to the company&#x27;s short-term asset like inventory. 
* Capital spending: this is the cost or gain related to the company&#x27;s fix asset such as the cash used to buy a new equipment or the cash which is gained from selling an old equipment.

The sum of the three component above will be the cash flow for a project.

And the cash flow for a company also include three parts:

*Operating cash flow: refers to the cash received or loss because of the internal activities of a company such as the cash received from sales revenue or the cash paid to the workers.
*Investment cash flow: refers to the cash flow which related to the company&#x27;s fixed assets such as equipment building and so on such as the cash used to buy a new equipment or a building
*Financing cash flow: cash flow from a company&#x27;s financing activities like issuing stock or paying dividends.

The sum of the three components above will be the total cash flow of a company.

==Examples==
The net cash flow only provides a limited amount of information. Compare, for instance, the cash flows over three years of two companies:

Company B has a higher yearly cash flow. However, Company A is actually earning more cash by its core activities and has already spent 45M in long term investments, of which the revenues will only show up after three years.

<doc id="53754" wikidata="Q134862" url="?curid=53754" title="Champagne">
<text>Champagne (; ) is a sparkling wine originated and produced in the Champagne wine region of France under the rules of the appellation, which demand specific vineyard practices, sourcing of grapes exclusively from designated places within it, specific grape-pressing methods and secondary fermentation of the wine in the bottle to cause carbonation. 
The grapes Pinot noir, Pinot meunier, and Chardonnay are used to produce almost all Champagne, but small amounts of Pinot blanc, Pinot gris (called Fromenteau in Champagne), Arbane, and Petit Meslier are vinified as well.

Champagne became associated with royalty in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries. The leading manufacturers made efforts to associate their Champagnes with nobility and royalty through advertising and packaging, which led to its popularity among the emerging middle class.

==Origins==
Still wines from the Champagne region were known before medieval times. The Romans were the first to plant vineyards in this area of northeast France, with the region being tentatively cultivated by the 5th century. Cultivation was initially slow due to the unpopular edict by Emperor Domitian that all colonial vines must be uprooted. When Emperor Probus, the son of a gardener, rescinded the edict, a temple to Bacchus was erected, and the region started to produce a light, fruity, red wine that contrasted with heavier Italian brews often fortified with resin and herbs. Later, the Catholic church owned vineyards, and monks produced wine for use in the sacrament of the Eucharist. French kings were traditionally anointed in Reims, and champagne was served as part of coronation festivities. The Champenois were envious of the reputation of the wines made by their Burgundian neighbours to the south and sought to produce wines of equal acclaim. However, the northern climate of the region gave the Champenois a unique set of challenges in making red wine. At the far extremes of sustainable viticulture, the grapes would struggle to ripen fully and often would have bracing levels of acidity and low sugar levels. The wines would be lighter bodied and thinner than the Burgundy wines they sought to outdo.

Contrary to legend and popular assumption, Dom Pérignon did not invent sparkling wine, though he did make important contributions to the production and quality of both still and sparkling Champagne wines. The oldest recorded sparkling wine is Blanquette de Limoux, which was invented by Benedictine monks in the Abbey of Saint-Hilaire, near Carcassonne, in 1531. They achieved this by bottling the wine before the initial fermentation had ended. Over a century later, the English scientist and physician Christopher Merret documented the addition of sugar to a finished wine to create a second fermentation six years before Dom Pérignon set foot in the Abbey of Hautvillers. Merret presented a paper at the Royal Society, in which he detailed what is now called &quot;&quot;, in 1662. Merret&#x27;s discoveries coincided also with English glass-makers&#x27; technical developments that allowed bottles to be produced that could withstand the required internal pressures during secondary fermentation. French glass-makers at this time could not produce bottles of the required quality or strength. As early as 1663, the poet Samuel Butler referred to &quot;brisk champagne&quot;.

In France, the first sparkling champagne was created accidentally; the pressure in the bottle led it to be called &quot;the devil&#x27;s wine&quot; (&#x27;), as bottles exploded or corks popped. At the time, bubbles were considered a fault. In 1844, Adolphe Jaquesson invented the muselet to prevent the corks from blowing out. Initial versions were difficult to apply and inconvenient to remove. Even when it was deliberately produced as a sparkling wine, champagne was for a very long time made by the &#x27;, where the wine was bottled before the initial fermentation had finished. Champagne did not use the &quot;&quot; until the 19th century, about 200 years after Merret documented the process. The 19th century saw a dramatic growth in champagne production, going from a regional production of 300,000 bottles a year in 1800 to 20 million bottles in 1850. In 2007, champagne sales hit a record of 338.7 million bottles.

In the 19th century, champagne was noticeably sweeter than today&#x27;s champagnes. The trend towards drier champagne began when Perrier-Jouët decided not to sweeten his 1846 vintage before exporting it to London. The designation &quot;Brut&quot; Champagne was created for the British in 1876.

The only wines that are legally allowed to be named “Champagne” must be bottled within 100 miles of the Champagne region in France. The name is legally protected by European law and an 1891 treaty that requires true champagne to be produced in the Champagne region and made from the Pinot Meunier, Pinot Noir, or Chardonnay grapes grown in this region.

==Rights to the name==


The Champagne winemaking community, under the auspices of the (CIVC), has developed a comprehensive set of rules and regulations for all wine produced in the region to protect its economic interests. They include codification of the most suitable growing places, the most suitable grape types (most Champagne is a blend of up to three grape varieties, though other varieties are allowed), and a lengthy set of requirements specifying most aspects of viticulture. This includes pruning, vineyard yield, the degree of pressing, and the time that wine must remain on its lees before bottling. It can also limit the release of Champagne to market to maintain prices. Only when a wine meets these requirements may it be labelled Champagne. The rules agreed upon by the CIVC are submitted for the final approval of the (formerly the &quot;&quot;, INAO).

In 2007, the INAO, the government organization that controls wine appellations in France, was preparing to make the largest revision of the region&#x27;s legal boundaries since 1927 in response to economic pressures. With soaring demand and limited production of grapes, Champagne houses say the rising price could produce a consumer backlash that would harm the industry for years into the future. That and political pressure from villages that wanted to be included in the expanded boundaries led to the move. Changes are subject to significant scientific review and are said not to impact Champagne-produced grapes until 2020. A final decision is not expected until 2023 or 2024.

===Use of the word &quot;Champagne&quot;===

Sparkling wines are produced worldwide, but many legal structures reserve the word &quot;Champagne&quot; exclusively for sparkling wines from the Champagne region, made in accordance with regulations. In the European Union and many other countries, the name &quot;Champagne&quot; is legally protected by the Madrid system under an 1891 treaty, which reserved it for the sparkling wine produced in the eponymous region and adhering to the standards defined for it as an &quot;&quot;; the protection was reaffirmed in the Treaty of Versailles after World War I. Over 70 countries have adopted similar legal protection. Most recently Australia, Chile, Brazil, Canada and China passed laws or signed agreements with Europe that limit the use of the term &quot;Champagne&quot; to only those products produced in the Champagne region. The United States bans the use of all new U.S.-produced wine brands. However, those that had approval to use the term on labels before 2006 may continue to use it, provided the term is accompanied by the wine&#x27;s actual origin (e.g., &quot;California&quot;). The majority of US-produced sparkling wines do not use the term &quot;Champagne&quot; on their labels, and some states, such as Oregon, ban producers in their states from using the term.

Several key U.S. wine regions, such as those in California (Napa, Sonoma Valley, Paso Robles), Oregon, and Walla Walla, Washington, came to consider the remaining semi-generic labels as harmful to their reputations (cf. Napa Declaration on Place).

Even the terms &#x27; and &quot;Champagne method&quot; were forbidden by an EU court decision in 1994. the description most often used for sparkling wines using the second fermentation in the bottle process, but not from the Champagne region, is &#x27;. Sparkling wines are produced worldwide, and many producers use special terms to define them: Spain uses &quot;Cava&quot;, Italy designates it &#x27;, and South Africa uses &#x27;. An Italian sparkling wine made from the Muscat grape uses the DOCG &quot;Asti&quot; and from the Glera grape the DOC &quot;Prosecco&quot;. In Germany, Sekt is a common sparkling wine. Other French wine regions cannot use the name Champagne: e.g., Burgundy and Alsace produce &quot;&quot;. In 2008, more than 3,000 bottles of sparkling wine produced in California labelled with the term &quot;Champagne&quot; were destroyed by Belgian government authorities.

Regardless of the legal requirements for labeling, extensive efforts by the Champagne region, and the use of alternative names by non-Champagne sparkling wine producers, some consumers, and wine sellers, including &quot;Korbels California Champagne&quot;, use &quot;Champagne&quot; as a generic term for white sparkling wines, regardless of origin.

The village of Champagne, Switzerland has traditionally made a still wine labelled as &quot;Champagne&quot;: the earliest records of viticulture dated to 1657. In 1999, in an accord with the EU, the Swiss government conceded that, by 2004, the village would phase out the use of the name. Sales dropped from 110,000 bottles a year to 32,000 after the change. In April 2008, the villagers resolved to fight against the restriction following a Swiss open-air vote.

In the Soviet Union, all sparkling wines were called (&#x27;, Russian for &quot;that, which is of Champagne&quot;). The name is still used today for some brands of sparkling wines produced in former Soviet republics, such as &#x27; and &quot;&quot;. In 2021, Russia banned the use of the designation for imported sparkling wine, including sparkling wine produced in the Champagne wine region, reserving the designation for domestically produced sparkling wine only.

==Production==

Formerly known as &quot;méthode champenoise&quot; or &quot;méthode classique&quot;, champagne is produced by a traditional method. After primary fermentation and bottling, a second alcoholic fermentation occurs in the bottle. This second fermentation is induced by adding several grams of yeast &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; and rock sugar to the bottle – although each brand has its own secret recipe. According to the &#x27; a minimum of one and a half years is required to completely develop all the flavour. For years where the harvest is exceptional, a &#x27; is declared and some champagne will be made from and labelled as the products of a single vintage (&quot;vintage champagne&quot;) rather than a blend of multiple years&#x27; harvests. This means that the champagne will be very good and has to mature for at least three years. During this time the champagne bottle is sealed with a crown cap similar to that used on beer bottles.

After aging, the bottle is manipulated, either manually or mechanically, in a process called &#x27; (or &quot;riddling&quot; in English), so that the lees settle in the neck of the bottle. After chilling the bottles, the neck is frozen, and the cap removed. This process is called disgorgement. The pressure in the bottle forces out the ice containing the lees. Some wine from previous vintages and additional sugar (&#x27;) is added to maintain the level within the bottle and adjust the sweetness of the finished wine. The bottle is then quickly corked to maintain the carbon dioxide in solution.

===Bubbles===
An initial burst of effervescence occurs when the champagne contacts the dry glass on pouring. These bubbles form on imperfections in the glass that facilitate nucleation or, to a minimal extent, on cellulose fibres left over from the wiping and drying process as shown with a high-speed video camera. However, after the initial rush, these naturally occurring imperfections are typically too small to consistently act as nucleation points as the surface tension of the liquid smooths out these minute irregularities. The nucleation sites that act as a source for the ongoing effervescence are not natural imperfections in the glass, but actually occur where the glass has been etched by the manufacturer or the customer. This etching is typically done with acid, a laser, or a glass etching tool from a craft shop to provide nucleation sites for continuous bubble formation (note that not all glasses are etched in this way). In 1662 this method was developed in England, as records from the Royal Society show.

Dom Pérignon was originally charged by his superiors at the Abbey of Hautvillers to get rid of the bubbles since the pressure in the bottles caused many of them to burst in the cellar. As sparkling wine production increased in the early 18th century, cellar workers had to wear a heavy iron mask to prevent injury from spontaneously bursting bottles. The disturbance caused by one bottle exploding could cause a chain reaction, with it being routine for cellars to lose 20–90% of their bottles this way. The mysterious circumstance surrounding the then unknown process of fermentation and carbonic gas caused some critics to call the sparkling creations &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Wine&quot;.

===Champagne producers===
There are more than one hundred champagne houses and 19,000 smaller &quot;&quot; (vine-growing producers) in Champagne. These companies manage some 32,000 hectares of vineyards in the region. The type of champagne producer can be identified from the abbreviations followed by the official number on the bottle:

* NM: &quot;. These companies (including the majority of the larger brands) buy grapes and make the wine
* CM: &quot;. Cooperatives that make wines from the growers who are members, with all the grapes pooled together
* RM: &quot;. (Also known as Grower Champagne) A grower that also makes wine from its own grapes (a maximum of 5% of purchased grapes is permitted). Note that co-operative members who take their bottles to be disgorged at the co-op can now label themselves as RM instead of RC
* SR: &quot;. An association of growers making a shared Champagne but who are not a co-operative
* RC: &quot;. A co-operative member selling champagne produced by the co-operative under its own name and label
* MA: &#x27; or &#x27;. A brand name unrelated to the producer or grower; the name is owned by someone else, for example a supermarket
* ND: &quot;. A wine merchant selling under his own name

===Marketing===

In the 19th century, champagne was produced and promoted to mark contemporary political events, such as the Franco-Russian Alliance of 1893, and the Tennis Court Oath to mark the centennial of French Revolution, linking champagne to French nationalist ideology. Négociants also managed to market champagne by identifying it with leisure activities and sporting events. They also successfully appealed to a broader range of consumers by highlighting the different qualities of sparkling wine versus ordinary wine, associating champagne brands with royalty and nobility, and selling off-brands under the names of importers from France at a lower cost. However, selling off-brands at a lower price proved to be unsuccessful, since &quot;there was an assumption that cheap sparkling wine was not authentic.&quot; Since the beginning of the Belle Époque period, champagne has gone from a regional product serving a niche market to a national commodity which is distributed globally.

The popularity of champagne is particularly attributed to the success of champagne producers in marketing the wine&#x27;s image as a royal and aristocratic drink. Laurent-Perrier&#x27;s advertisements in late 1890 boasted their champagne was the favourite of Leopold II of Belgium, George I of Greece, Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Margaret Cambridge, Marchioness of Cambridge, and John Lambton, 3rd Earl of Durham, among other nobles, knights, and military officers. Despite this royal prestige, champagne houses also portrayed champagne as a luxury which could be enjoyed by anyone, and was fit for any occasion. This strategy worked, and, by the turn of the 20th century, the majority of champagne drinkers were middle class.

In the 19th century, champagne producers made a concentrated effort to market their wine to women. This is done by having the sweeter champagne associates with female, whereas the dry champagne with male and foreign markets. This was in stark contrast to the traditionally &quot;male aura&quot; that the wines of France had—particularly Burgundy and Bordeaux. Laurent-Perrier again took the lead in this area with advertisements touting their wine&#x27;s favour with the Countess of Dudley, the wife of the 9th Earl of Stamford, the wife of the Baron Tollemache, and the opera singer Adelina Patti. Champagne labels were designed with images of romantic love and marriage as well as other special occasions that were deemed important to women, such as the baptism of a child.

In some advertisements, the champagne houses catered to political interest such as the labels that appeared on different brands on bottles commemorating the centennial anniversary of the French Revolution of 1789. On some labels there were flattering images of Marie Antoinette that appealed to the conservative factions of French citizens that viewed the former queen as a martyr. On other labels there were stirring images of Revolutionary scenes that appealed to the liberal left sentiments of French citizens. As World War I loomed, champagne houses put images of soldiers and countries&#x27; flags on their bottles, customizing the image for each country to which the wine was imported. During the Dreyfus affair, one champagne house released a &quot;champagne antijuif&quot; with antisemitic advertisements to take advantage of the wave of Antisemitism that hit parts of France.

Champagne is typically drunk during celebrations. For example, British Prime Minister Tony Blair held a champagne reception to celebrate London winning the right to host the 2012 Summer Olympics. It is also used to launch ships when a bottle is smashed over the hull during the ship&#x27;s launch. If the bottle fails to break this is often thought to be bad luck.

==Wine districts, grape varieties and styles==

=== Wine-producing districts of Champagne ===
Champagne is a single &quot;&quot; but the territory is divided into next sub-regions, known as wine-producing districts, and each of them has distinct characteristics. The main wine-producing districts of the Champagne wine region: Reims, Marne Valley, Côte des Blancs, Côtes des Bar, Côtes de Sezzane.

As a general rule, grapes used must be the white Chardonnay, or the dark-skinned &quot;red wine grapes&quot; Pinot noir or Pinot meunier, which, due to the gentle pressing of the grapes and absence of skin contact during fermentation, usually also yield a white base wine. Most Champagnes, including Rosé wines, are made from a blend of all three grapes, although &#x27; (&quot;white from whites&quot;) Champagnes are made from 100% Chardonnay and &#x27; (&quot;white from blacks&quot;) Champagnes are made solely from Pinot noir, Pinot meunier or a mix of the two.

Four other grape varieties are permitted, mostly for historical reasons, as they are rare in current usage. The 2010 version of the appellation regulations lists seven varieties as allowed, Arbane, Chardonnay, Petit Meslier, Pinot blanc, Pinot gris, Pinot meunier, and Pinot noir. The sparsely cultivated varieties (0.02% of the total vines planted in Champagne) of Arbanne, Petit Meslier, and Pinot blanc can still be found in modern cuvées from a few producers. Previous directives of INAO make conditional allowances according to the complex laws of 1927 and 1929, and plantings made before 1938. Before the 2010 regulations, the complete list of the actual and theoretical varieties also included and Pinot Rosé. The Gamay vines of the region were scheduled to be uprooted by 1942, but due to World War II, this was postponed until 1962, and this variety is no longer allowed in Champagne.

The dark-skinned Pinot noir and Pinot meunier give the wine its length and backbone. They are predominantly grown in two areas – the Montagne de Reims and the Vallée de la Marne. The Montagne de Reims run east–west to the south of Reims, in northern Champagne. They are notable for north-facing chalky slopes that derive heat from the warm winds rising from the valleys below. The River Marne runs west–east through Champagne, south of the Montagne de Reims. The Vallée de la Marne contains south-facing chalky slopes. Chardonnay gives the wine its acidity and biscuit flavour. Most Chardonnay is grown in a north–south-running strip to the south of Épernay, called the , including the villages of Avize, Oger and . These are east-facing vineyards, with &#x27; similar to the . The various &#x27; account for the differences in grape characteristics and explain the appropriateness of blending juice from different grape varieties and geographical areas within Champagne, to get the desired style for each Champagne house.

===Types of Champagne===

Most of the Champagne produced today is &quot;Non-vintage&quot;, meaning that it is a blended product of grapes from multiple vintages. Most of the base will be from a single year vintage with producers blending anywhere from 10 to 15% (even as high as 40%) of wine from older vintages. If the conditions of a particular vintage are favourable, some producers will make a &quot;vintage&quot; wine, which must be composed entirely of grapes from that vintage year. Under Champagne wine regulations, houses that make both vintage and non-vintage wines are allowed to use no more than 80% of the total vintage&#x27;s harvest for the production of vintage Champagne. This allows at least 20% of the harvest from each vintage to be reserved for use in non-vintage Champagne. This ensures a consistent style that consumers can expect from non-vintage Champagne that does not alter too radically depending on the quality of the vintage. In less than ideal vintages, some producers will produce a wine from only that single vintage and still label it as non-vintage rather than as &quot;vintage&quot; since the wine will be of lesser quality and the producers have little desire to reserve the wine for future blending.

====Prestige &quot;&quot;====
A &#x27; is a proprietary blended wine (usually a Champagne) that is considered to be the top of a producer&#x27;s range. Famous examples include Louis Roederer&#x27;s Cristal, Laurent-Perrier&#x27;s &#x27;, Moët &amp; Chandon&#x27;s Dom Pérignon, Duval-Leroy&#x27;s &#x27;, Armand de Brignac &quot;Gold Brut&quot;, and Pol Roger&#x27;s &#x27;. Perhaps the first publicly available prestige &#x27; was Moët &amp; Chandon&#x27;s Dom Pérignon, launched in 1936 with the 1921 vintage. Until then, Champagne houses produced different &#x27; of varying quality, but a top-of-the-range wine produced to the highest standards (and priced accordingly) was a new idea. In fact, Louis Roederer had been producing Cristal since 1876, but this was strictly for the private consumption of the Russian tsar. Cristal was made publicly available with the 1945 vintage. Then came Taittinger&#x27;s &#x27; (first vintage 1952), and &#x27;s &#x27; in 1960, a blend of three vintages (1952, 1953, and 1955) and Perrier Jouët&#x27;s &#x27;. In the last three decades of the 20th century, most Champagne houses followed these with their own prestige &#x27;, often named after notable people with a link to that producer and presented in non-standard bottle shapes (following Dom Pérignon&#x27;s lead with its 18th-century revival design).

A French term (literally &quot;white from blacks&quot; or &quot;white of blacks&quot;) for a white wine produced entirely from black grapes. The flesh of grapes described as black or red is white; grape juice obtained after minimal possible contact with the skins produces essentially white wine, with a slightly yellower colour than wine from white grapes. The colour, due to the small amount of red skin pigments present, is often described as white-yellow, white-grey, or silvery. &quot;Blanc de noirs&quot; is often encountered in Champagne, where a number of houses have followed the lead of Bollinger&#x27;s &quot;prestige cuvée&quot; Vieilles Vignes Françaises in introducing a &quot;cuvée&quot; made from either pinot noir, pinot meunier or a blend of the two (these being the only two black grapes permitted within the Champagne AOC appellation).


A French term that means &quot;white from whites&quot;, and is used to designate Champagnes made exclusively from Chardonnay grapes or in rare occasions from Pinot blanc (such as &quot;&quot; from Cedric Bouchard). The term is occasionally used in other sparkling wine-producing regions, usually to denote Chardonnay-only wines rather than any sparkling wine made from other white grape varieties.

====Rosé Champagne====

Rosé Champagnes are characterized by their distinctive blush color, fruity aroma, and earthy flavor. Rosé Champagne has been produced since the late 18th century; storied French Champagne houses Rinault and Veuve Clicquot have each claimed to have shipped and sold the first bottles. The wine is produced by one of two methods. Using the &quot;saignée&quot; method, winemakers will leave the clear juice of dark grapes to macerate with the skins for a brief time, resulting in wine lightly colored and flavored by the skins. In the more common &quot;d&#x27;assemblage&quot; method, producers will blend a small amount of still red wine to a sparkling wine &quot;cuvée&quot;. Champagne is light in color even when it is produced with red grapes, because the juice is extracted from the grapes using a gentle process that minimizes contact with the skins. By contrast, Rosé Champagne, especially that created by &quot;d&#x27;assemblage&quot;, results in the production of rosé with a predictable and reproducible color, allowing winemakers to achieve a consistent rosé appearance from year to year.

The character of rosé Champagne has varied greatly since its production began. Thought to be a sign of extravagance when originally introduced, by the early 20th century these wines were colloquially known as &quot;Pink Champagne,&quot; and had gained a reputation of frivolousness or even dissipation. The 1939 Hollywood film &quot;Love Affair&quot; was reportedly approached to promote it by featuring the main characters bonding over enjoying the unpopular drink, and caused a sales boost after the film&#x27;s release. It is also cited by the Eagles as a beverage of choice in the titular &quot;Hotel California.&quot; Rosé Champagnes, particularly brut varieties, began regaining popularity in the late 20th century in many countries. Because of the complex variety of flavors it presents, rosé Champagne is often served in fine dining restaurants, as a complementary element in food and wine pairing.

===Sweetness===
Just after disgorgement a &quot;liqueur de dosage&quot; or liqueur d’expéditiona blend of, typically, cane sugar and wine (sugar amounts up to 750 g/litre)is added to adjust the levels of sugar in the Champagne when bottled for sale, and hence the sweetness of the finished wine. Today sweetness is generally not looked for per se, and dosage is used to fine tune the perception of acidity in the wine.

For Caroline Latrive, cellar master of Ayala, a Champagne house that pioneered drier champagnes at the end of the 19th century, dosage represents the final touch in champagne making and must be as subtle as possible to bring the right balance.

Additionally, dosage protects champagne from oxidation because it includes a small amount of , and sugar also acts as a preservative. Benoît Gouez, cellar master of Moët &amp; Chandon says that sugar helps champagne recover from the oxidative shock of disgorgement, and contributes to the wine&#x27;s aging potential.

Wines labeled &quot;&quot;, more common among smaller producers, have no added sugar and will usually be very dry, with less than three grams of residual sugar per litre in the finished wine. The following terms are used to describe the sweetness of the bottled wine:

* &quot; (less than 6 grams of sugar per litre)
* &quot; (less than 12 grams)
* &quot;Extra Dry&quot; (between 12 and 17 grams)
* &quot; (between 17 and 32 grams)
* &quot; (between 32 and 50 grams)
* &quot; (50 grams)

The most common style today is &quot;. However, throughout the 19th century and into the early 20th century Champagne was generally much sweeter than it is today. Moreover, except in Britain, Champagne was drunk as dessert wines (after the meal), rather than as table wines (with the meal). At this time, Champagne sweetness was instead referred to by destination country, roughly as:
* &#x27; (&quot;English taste&quot;, between 22 and 66 grams); note that today &#x27; refers to aged vintage Champagne
* &quot;&quot; (&quot;American taste&quot;, between 110 and 165 grams)
* &quot;&quot; (&quot;French taste&quot;, between 165 and 200 grams)
* &quot;&quot; (&quot;Russian taste&quot;, between 200 and 300 grams)
Of these, only the driest English is close to contemporary tastes.

==Bottles==

Champagne is mostly fermented in two sizes of bottles, standard bottles (750 millilitres) and magnums (1.5 litres). In general, magnums are thought to be higher quality, as there is less oxygen in the bottle, and the volume–to–surface-area ratio favours the creation of appropriately sized bubbles. However, there is no hard evidence for this view. Other bottle sizes, mostly named for Biblical figures, are generally filled with Champagne that has been fermented in standard bottles or magnums. Gosset still bottles its Grande Réserve in Jeroboam from the beginning of its second fermentation.

Sizes larger than Jeroboam (3 L) are rare. Primat bottles (27 L)—and, , Melchizedek bottles (30 L)—are exclusively offered by the House Drappier. (The same names are used for bottles containing regular wine and port; however, &quot;Jeroboam&quot;, &quot;Rehoboam&quot;, and &quot;Methuselah&quot; refer to different bottle volumes.)

Unique sizes have been made for specific markets, special occasions and people. The most notable example is perhaps the imperial pint (56.8 cL) bottle made between 1874 and 1973 for the English market by Pol Roger, often associated with Sir Winston Churchill.

In 2009, a bottle of 1825 Champagne was opened at a ceremony attended by twelve of the world&#x27;s top wine tasters. This bottle was officially recognised by &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the oldest bottle of Champagne in the world. The contents were found to be drinkable, with notes of truffles and caramel in the taste. There are now only two other bottles from the 1825 vintage extant.

In July 2010, 168 bottles were found on board a shipwreck near the Åland Islands in the Baltic Sea by Finnish diver Christian Ekström. Initial analyses indicated there were at least two types of bottle from two different houses: &quot;&quot; in Reims and the long-defunct Champagne house Juglar (absorbed into Jacquesson in 1829.) The shipwreck is dated between 1800 and 1830, and the bottles discovered may well predate the 1825 referenced above. When experts were replacing the old corks with new ones, they discovered there were also bottles from a third house, Heidsieck. The wreck, then, contained 95 bottles of Juglar, 46 bottles of , and four bottles of Heidsieck, in addition to 23 bottles whose manufacture is still to be identified. Champagne experts Richard Juhlin and Essi Avellan, MW described the bottles&#x27; contents as being in a very good condition. It is planned that the majority of the bottles will be sold at auction, the price of each estimated to be in the region of £40,000–70,000.

In April 2015, nearly five years after the bottles were first found, researchers led by Philippe Jeandet, a professor of food biochemistry, released the findings of their chemical analyses of the Champagne, and particularly noted the fact that, although the chemical composition of the 170-year-old Champagne was very similar to the composition of modern-day Champagne, there was much more sugar in this Champagne than in modern-day Champagne, and it was also less alcoholic than modern-day Champagne. The high sugar level was characteristic of people&#x27;s tastes at the time, and Jeandet explained that it was common for people in the 19th century, such as Russians, to add sugar to their wine at dinner. It also contained higher concentrations of minerals such as iron, copper, and table salt than modern-day Champagne does.

===Champagne corks===
Champagne corks are mostly built from three sections and are referred to as agglomerated corks. The mushroom shape that occurs in the transition is a result of the bottom section&#x27;s being composed of two stacked discs of pristine cork cemented to the upper portion, which is a conglomerate of ground cork and glue. The bottom section is in contact with the wine. Before insertion, a sparkling wine cork is almost 50% larger than the opening of the bottle. Originally, the cork starts as a cylinder and is compressed before insertion into the bottle. Over time, their compressed shape becomes more permanent and the distinctive &quot;mushroom&quot; shape becomes more apparent.

The aging of the Champagne post-disgorgement can to some degree be told by the cork, as, the longer it has been in the bottle, the less it returns to its original cylinder shape.

==Serving==

Champagne is usually served in a Champagne flute, whose characteristics include a long stem with a tall, narrow bowl, thin sides and an etched bottom. The intended purpose of the shape of the flute is to reduce surface area, therefore preserving carbonation, as well as maximizing nucleation (the visible bubbles and lines of bubbles). Legend has it that the Victorian &quot;&#x27;s shape was modelled on the breast of Madame de Pompadour, chief-mistress of Louis XV of France, or perhaps Marie Antoinette, but the glass was designed in England over a century earlier especially for sparkling wine and champagne in 1663. Champagne is always served cold; its ideal drinking temperature is . Often the bottle is chilled in a bucket of ice and water, half an hour before opening, which also ensures the Champagne is less gassy and can be opened without spillage. Champagne buckets are made specifically for this purpose and often have a larger volume than standard wine-cooling buckets to accommodate the larger bottle, and more water and ice.

When it comes to the etiquette behind holding a glass of Champagne, it is important to consider the type of Champagne glass used and the four main parts of any wine glass: the rim, the bowl, the stem and the base. In the case of a flute glass or tulip glass, etiquette dictates holding by the long, narrow stem in order to avoid smudging the glass and warming up the contents with the heat of one&#x27;s hand. Flute and tulip glasses can be temporarily held by the rim, although this glass hold blocks the area where the taster would take a sip. This hold can also smudge the top section of the glass. These two types of glass can also be held by the disk-shaped base without smudging or warming the liquid inside. When it comes to the coupe glass, with its short stem and shallow, wide-brimmed bowl, the only possible glass hold is by the bowl. The top-heavy nature of the glass makes holding by the base or stem impossible, while the large diameter of the top makes grabbing the glass by the rim difficult.

===Opening Champagne bottles===
To reduce the risk of spilling or spraying any Champagne, the bottle is opened by holding the cork and rotating the bottle at an angle in order to ease out the stopper. This method, as opposed to pulling the cork out, prevents the cork from flying out of the bottle at speed (the expanding gases are supersonic). Also, holding the bottle at an angle allows air in and helps prevent the champagne from geysering out of the bottle.

A sabre can be used to open a Champagne bottle with great ceremony. This technique is called &quot; (the term is also used for simply breaking the head of the bottle).

===Pouring Champagne===
Pouring sparkling wine while tilting the glass at an angle and gently sliding in the liquid along the side will preserve the most bubbles, as opposed to pouring directly down to create a head of &quot;mousse&quot;, according to a study, &quot;On the Losses of Dissolved CO2 during Champagne serving&quot;, by scientists from the University of Reims. Colder bottle temperatures also result in reduced loss of gas. Additionally, the industry is developing Champagne glasses designed specifically to reduce the amount of gas lost.

===Spraying Champagne===

Champagne has been an integral part of sports celebration since started offering their Champagne to the winners of Formula 1 Grand Prix events. At the 1967 24 Hours of Le Mans, winner Dan Gurney started the tradition of drivers spraying the crowd and each other. The Muslim-majority nation Bahrain banned Champagne celebrations on F1 podiums in 2004, using a nonalcoholic pomegranate and rose water drink instead.

In 2015, some Australian athletes, most notably then-Formula 1 Red Bull Racing driver Daniel Ricciardo, began celebrating victories by drinking champagne from their shoe—a practice known as &quot;doing a shoey.&quot;

== Culinary uses ==
The (&quot;chicken with Champagne&quot;) is an essentially Marnese specialty. Other well-known recipes using Champagne are (&quot;oysters with Champagne&quot;) and Champagne zabaglione.

== Price ==
There are several general factors influencing the price of Champagne: the limited land of the region, the prestige that Champagne has developed worldwide, and the high cost of the production process, among possible others.

==Shipments==
The Champagne industry is expected to ship 314 million bottles in 2023, down 3.7% from the previous year, according to the Comité Champagne industry trade group. Nightclub markets remain strong, but consumption of Champagne in the home is losing ground.

<text>The wine region within the historical province of Champagne in the northeast of France is best known for the production of champagne, the sparkling white wine that bears the region&#x27;s name. EU law and the laws of most countries reserve the term &quot;champagne&quot; exclusively for wines that come from this region located about 160 kilometres (100 miles) east of Paris. The viticultural boundaries of Champagne are legally defined and split into five wine-producing districts within the historical province: Aube, Côte des Blancs, Côte de Sézanne, Montagne de Reims, and Vallée de la Marne. The city of Reims and the town of Épernay are the commercial centers of the area. Reims is famous for its cathedral, the venue of the coronation of the French kings and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Located at the northern edges of France, the history of the Champagne wine region has had a significant role in the development of this unique &quot;terroir&quot;. The area&#x27;s proximity to Paris promoted the region&#x27;s economic success in its wine trade but also put the villages and vineyards in the path of marching armies on their way to the French capital. Despite the frequency of these military conflicts, the region developed a reputation for quality wine production in the early Middle Ages and was able to continue that reputation as the region&#x27;s producers began making sparkling wine with the advent of the great champagne houses in the 17th and 18th centuries. The principal grapes grown in the region include Chardonnay, Pinot noir, and Pinot Meunier. Pinot noir is the most widely planted grape in the Aube region and grows very well in Montagne de Reims. Pinot Meunier is the dominant grape in the Vallée de la Marne region. The Côte des Blancs is dedicated almost exclusively to Chardonnay.

The unique, chalky landscape of the Champagne wine region and the resulting agro-industrial system led to the development of sparkling wines like champagne in the 17th century. As a result, many of the production sites and wine houses in the region were inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2015 as part the Champagne hillsides, houses and cellars site. 

== Geography and climate ==

The Champagne province is located near the northern limits of the wine world along the 49th parallel. The high latitude and mean annual temperature of 10 °C (50 °F) creates a difficult environment for wine grapes to fully ripen. Ripening is aided by the presence of forests which helps to stabilize temperatures and maintain moisture in the soil. The cool temperatures serve to produce high levels of acidity in the resulting grape which is ideal for sparkling wine.

During the growing season, the mean July temperature is 18 °C (66 °F). The average annual rainfall is 630 mm (25 inches), with 45 mm (1.8 inches) falling during the harvest month of September. Throughout the year, growers must be mindful of the hazards of fungal disease and early spring frost.

Ancient oceans left behind chalk subsoil deposits when they receded 70 million years ago. Earthquakes that rocked the region over 10 million years ago pushed the marine sediments of belemnite fossils up to the surface to create the belemnite chalk terrain. The belemnite in the soil allows it to absorb heat from the sun and gradually release it during the night as well as providing good drainage. This soil contributes to the lightness and finesse that is characteristic of Champagne wine. The Aube area is an exception with predominately clay based soil. The chalk is also used in the construction of underground cellars that can keep the wines cool through the bottle maturation process.

==History==
The Carolingian reign saw periods of prosperity for the Champagne region beginning with Charlemagne&#x27;s encouragement for the area to start planting vines and continuing with the coronation of his son Louis the Pious at Reims. The tradition of crowning kings at Reims contributed to the reputation of the wines that came from this area. The Counts of Champagne ruled the area as an independent county from 950 to 1316. In 1314, the last Count of Champagne assumed the throne as King Louis X of France and the region became part of the Crown territories.

=== Military conflicts ===
The location of Champagne played a large role in its historical prominence as it served as a &quot;crossroads&quot; for both military and trade routes. This also made the area open to devastation and destruction during military conflicts that were frequently waged in the area. In 451 A.D. near Châlons-en-Champagne, Attila and the Huns were defeated by an alliance of Roman legions, Franks and Visigoths. This defeat was a turning point in the Huns&#x27; invasion of Europe.

During the Hundred Years&#x27; War, the land was repeatedly ravaged and devastated by battles. The Abbey of Hautvillers, including its vineyards, was destroyed in 1560 during the War of Religion between the Huguenots and Catholics. This was followed by conflicts during the Thirty Year War and the &quot;Fronde&quot; Civil War where soldiers and mercenaries held the area in occupation. It was not until the 1660s, during the reign of Louis XIV, that the region saw enough peace to allow advances in sparkling wine production to take place.

=== History of wine production ===

The region&#x27;s reputation for wine production dates back to the Middle Ages when Pope Urban II ( ruled 1088-1099 AD/CE ), a native Champenois, declared that the wine of Aÿ in the Marne département was the best wine produced in the world. For a time &quot;Aÿ&quot; was used as a shorthand designation for wines from the entire Champagne region, similar to the use of Beaune for the wines of Burgundy. The poet Henry d&#x27;Andeli&#x27;s work &quot;La Bataille des Vins&quot; rated wines from the towns of Épernay, Hautvillers and Reims as some of the best in Europe. As the region&#x27;s reputation grew, popes and royalty sought to own pieces of the land with Pope Leo X, Francis I of France, Charles V of Spain, and Henry VIII of England all owning vineyard land in the region. A batch of wine from Aÿ received in 1518 by Henry VIII&#x27;s chancellor, Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, is the first recorded export of wine from the Champagne region to England.

The still wines of the area were highly prized in Paris under the designation of &quot;vins de la rivière&quot; and &quot;vins de la montagne&quot;- wines of the river and wines of the mountain in reference to the wooded terrain and the river Marne which carried the wines down to the Seine and into Paris. The region was in competition with Burgundy for the Flemish wine trade and tried to capitalize on Reims&#x27; location along the trade route from Beaune. In the 15th century, Pinot noir became heavily planted in the area. The resulting red wine had difficulty comparing well to the richness and coloring of Burgundy wines, despite the addition of elderberries to deepen the color. This led to a greater focus on white wines.

The Champagne house of Gosset was founded as a still wine producer in 1584 and is the oldest Champagne house still in operation today. Ruinart was founded in 1729 and was soon followed by Chanoine Frères (1730), Taittinger (1734), Moët et Chandon (1743) and Veuve Clicquot (1772).

The nineteenth century saw an explosive growth in Champagne production going from a regional production of 300,000 bottles a year in 1800 to 20 million bottles in 1850.

====Rivalry with Burgundy====
A strong influence on Champagne wine production was the centuries-old rivalry between the region and Burgundy. From the key market of Paris to the palace of Louis XIV of France at Versailles, proponents of Champagne and Burgundy would compete for dominance. For most of his life, Louis XIV would drink only Champagne wine with the support of his doctor Antoine d&#x27;Aquin who advocated the King drink Champagne with every meal for the benefit of his health. As the King aged and his ailments increased, competing doctors would propose alternative treatments with alternative wines, to soothe the King&#x27;s ills. One of these doctors, Guy-Crescent Fagon conspired with the King&#x27;s mistress to oust d&#x27;Aquin and have himself appointed as Royal Doctor. Fagon quickly attributed the King&#x27;s continuing ailments to Champagne and ordered that only Burgundy wine must be served at the royal table.

This development had a ripple effect throughout both regions and in the Paris markets. Both Champagne and Burgundy were deeply concerned with the &quot;healthiness&quot; reputation of their wines, even to the extent of paying medical students to write theses touting the health benefit of their wines. These theses were then used as advertising pamphlets that were sent to merchants and customers. The Faculty of Medicine in Reims published several papers to refute Fagon&#x27;s claim that Burgundy wine was healthier than Champagne. In response, Burgundian winemakers hired physician Jean-Baptiste de Salins, dean of the medical school in Beaune, to speak to a packed auditorium at the Paris Faculty of Medicine. Salins spoke favorably of Burgundy wine&#x27;s deep color and robust nature and compared it to the pale red color of Champagne and the &quot;instability&quot; of the wine to travel long distances and the flaws of the bubbles from when secondary fermentation would take place. The text of his speech was published in newspapers and pamphlets throughout France and had a damaging effect on Champagne sales.

The war of words would continue for another 130 years with endless commentary from doctors, poets, playwrights and authors all arguing for their favorite region and their polemics being reproduced in advertisements for Burgundy and Champagne. On a few occasions, the two regions were on the brink of civil war. A turning point occurred when several Champagne wine makers abandoned efforts to produce red wine in favor of focusing on harnessing the effervescent nature of sparkling Champagne. As the bubbles became more popular, doctors throughout France and Europe commented on the health benefits of the sparkling bubbles which were said to cure malaria. As more Champenois winemakers embarked on this new and completely different wine style, the rivalry with Burgundy mellowed and eventually waned.

==Classifications and vineyard regulations==


In 1927, viticultural boundaries of Champagne were legally defined and split into five wine-producing districts: The Aube, Côte des Blancs, Côte de Sézanne, Montagne de Reims, and Vallée de la Marne. This area covered in 2008 33,500 hectares (76,000 acres) of vineyards around 319 villages that were home to 5,000 growers who made their own wine and 14,000 growers who only sold grapes.

The different districts produce grapes of varying characteristics that are blended by the Champagne houses to create their distinct house styles. The Pinots of the Montagne de Reims that are planted on northern facing slopes are known for their high levels of acid and the delicacy they add to the blend. The grapes on the southern facing slope add more power and character. Grapes across the district contribute to the bouquet and headiness. The abundance of southern facing slopes in the Vallée de la Marne produces the ripest wines with full aroma. The Côte des Blancs grapes are known for their finesse and the freshness they add to blends with the extension of the nearby Côte de Sézanne offering similar though slightly less distinguished traits.

In 1941, the &quot;Comité Interprofessionnel du Vin de Champagne&quot; (CIVC) was formed with the purpose of protecting Champagne&#x27;s reputation and marketing forces as well as setting up and monitoring regulations for vineyard production and vinification methods. Champagne is the only region that is permitted to exclude AOC or &quot;Appellation d&#x27;Origine Contrôlée&quot; from their labels.

For each vintage, the CIVC rated the villages of the area based on the quality of their grapes and vineyards. The rating was then used to determine the price and the percentage of the price that growers get. The &quot;Grand Cru&quot; rated vineyards received 100 percent rating which entitled the grower to 100% of the price. &quot;Premier Crus&quot; were vineyards with 90–99% ratings while &quot;Deuxième Crus&quot; received 80–89% ratings.
Under appellation rules, around 4,000 kilograms (8,800 pounds) of grapes can be pressed to create up to 673 gallons (either 2,550 L or 3,060 L) of juice. The first 541 gallons (either 2,050 L or 2,460 L) are the &quot;cuvée&quot; and the next 132 gallons (either 500 L or 600 L) are the &quot;taille&quot;. Prior to 1992, a second &quot;taille&quot; of 44 gallons (either 167 L or 200 L) was previously allowed. For vintage Champagne, 100% of the grapes must come from that vintage year while non-vintage wine is a blend of vintages. Vintage champagne must spend a minimum of three years of aging. There are no regulations about how long it must spend on its lees, but some of the premier Champagne houses keep their wines on lees for upwards of five to ten years. Non-vintage Champagne must spend a minimum of 15 months of aging but only a minimum of 12 months on the lees. Most of the Champagne houses keep their wines on the lees throughout the entire aging period because it is more expensive to bottle the wine before aging it, as opposed to bottling and shipping the product in a single step at the end of the fermentation-and-aging process.

===Revision of the Champagne region===

The worldwide demand for Champagne has been continuously increasing throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. A record in worldwide shipping of Champagne (including domestic French consumption) of 327 million bottles was set in 1999 in anticipation of end of millennium celebrations, and a new record was set in 2007 at 338.7 million bottles. Since the entire vineyard area authorized by the 1927 AOC regulations is now under cultivation, various ways of expanding the production have been considered. The allowed yield was increased (to a maximum of 15,500 kg per hectare during an experimental period from 2007 to 2011) and the possibility of revising the production region was examined.

After an extensive review of vineyard conditions in and around the existing Champagne region, INAO presented a proposal to revise the region on March 14, 2008. The proposal was prepared by a group of five experts in the subjects of history, geography, geology, phytosociology and agronomy, working from 2005. The proposal means expanding the region to cover vineyards in 357 rather than 319 villages. This is to be achieved by adding vineyards in forty villages while simultaneously removing two villages in the Marne department that were included in the 1927 regulations, Germaine and Orbais-l&#x27;Abbaye.

The proposed 40 new Champagne villages are located in four &quot;départements&quot;:

* 22 in Marne: Baslieux-les-Fismes, Blacy, Boissy-le-Repos, Bouvancourt, Breuil-sur-Vesle, Bussy-le-Repos, Champfleury, Courlandon, Courcy, Courdemanges, Fismes, Huiron, La Ville-sous-Orbais, Le Thoult-Trosnay, Loivre, Montmirail, Mont-sur-Courville, Peas, Romain, Saint-Loup, Soulanges, and Ventelay.
* 15 in Aube: Arrelles, Balnot-la-Grange, Bossancourt, Bouilly, Étourvy, Fontvannes, Javernant, Laines-aux-Bois, Macey, Messon, Prugny, Saint-Germain-l&#x27;Épine, Souligny, Torvilliers and Villery.
* Two in Haute-Marne: Champcourt and Harricourt.
* One, Marchais-en-Brie, in Aisne.

The INAO proposal was to be subject to review before being made into law and was immediately questioned in numerous public comments. The mayor of one of the villages to be delisted, Germaine, immediately appealed against INAO&#x27;s proposal, with the possibility of additional appeals by vineyard owners. The initial review process is expected to be finished by early 2009. This will be followed by another review of the specific parcels that will be added or deleted from the appellation. The earliest vineyard plantings are expected around 2015, with their product being marketed from around 2021. However, the price of land that are allowed to be used for Champagne production is expected to immediately rise from 5,000 to one million euro per hectare.

While some critics have feared the revision of the Champagne region is about expanding production irrespective of quality, British wine writer and Champagne expert Tom Stevenson has pointed out that the proposed additions constitute a consolidation rather than expansion. The villages under discussion are situated in gaps inside the perimeter of the existing Champagne regions rather than outside it.

As of 2019, the expansion had not happened, with a final decision expected in 2023 or 2024.

== Production other than sparkling wine ==

While totally dominating the region&#x27;s production, sparkling Champagne is not the only product that is made from the region&#x27;s grapes. Non-sparkling still wines, like those made around the village Bouzy, are sold under the appellation label &quot;Coteaux Champenois&quot;. There is also a rosé appellation in the region, &quot;Rosé des Riceys&quot;. The regional vin de liqueur is called &quot;Ratafia de Champagne&quot;. Since the profit of making sparkling Champagne from the region&#x27;s grape is now much higher, production of these non-sparkling wines and fortified wines is very small.

The pomace from the grape pressing is used to make &quot;Marc de Champagne&quot;, and in this case the production does not compete with that of Champagne, since the pomace is a by-product of wine production.

== Traditions ==

The end of harvest in Champagne is marked by a celebration known as &quot;la Fête du Cochelet&quot;. At Reims, &quot;St Jean is the patron of the cellar staff and those engaged in work connected with Champagne.&quot;

<text>In mathematics, a category (sometimes called an abstract category to distinguish it from a concrete category) is a collection of &quot;objects&quot; that are linked by &quot;arrows&quot;. A category has two basic properties: the ability to compose the arrows associatively and the existence of an identity arrow for each object. A simple example is the category of sets, whose objects are sets and whose arrows are functions.

&quot;Category theory&quot; is a branch of mathematics that seeks to generalize all of mathematics in terms of categories, independent of what their objects and arrows represent. Virtually every branch of modern mathematics can be described in terms of categories, and doing so often reveals deep insights and similarities between seemingly different areas of mathematics. As such, category theory provides an alternative foundation for mathematics to set theory and other proposed axiomatic foundations. In general, the objects and arrows may be abstract entities of any kind, and the notion of category provides a fundamental and abstract way to describe mathematical entities and their relationships.

In addition to formalizing mathematics, category theory is also used to formalize many other systems in computer science, such as the semantics of programming languages.

Two categories are the same if they have the same collection of objects, the same collection of arrows, and the same associative method of composing any pair of arrows. Two &quot;different&quot; categories may also be considered &quot;equivalent&quot; for purposes of category theory, even if they do not have precisely the same structure.

Well-known categories are denoted by a short capitalized word or abbreviation in bold or italics: examples include [[category of sets|Set]], the category of sets and set functions; [[category of rings|Ring]], the category of rings and ring homomorphisms; and [[category of topological spaces|Top]], the category of topological spaces and continuous maps. All of the preceding categories have the identity map as identity arrows and composition as the associative operation on arrows.

The classic and still much used text on category theory is &quot;Categories for the Working Mathematician&quot; by Saunders Mac Lane. Other references are given in the References below. The basic definitions in this article are contained within the first few chapters of any of these books.

Any monoid can be understood as a special sort of category (with a single object whose self-morphisms are represented by the elements of the monoid), and so can any preorder.

==Definition==
There are many equivalent definitions of a category. One commonly used definition is as follows. A category &quot;C&quot; consists of
* a class ob(&quot;C&quot;) of objects,
* a class mor(&quot;C&quot;) of morphisms or arrows,
*a domain or source class function dom: mor(C) → ob(C),
*a codomain or target class function cod: mor(C) → ob(C),
* for every three objects &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot;, a binary operation hom(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) × hom(&quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;) → hom(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;c&quot;) called composition of morphisms. Here hom(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) denotes the subclass of morphisms &quot;f&quot; in mor(&quot;C&quot;) such that dom(f) = &quot;a&quot; and cod(f) = &quot;b&quot;. Morphisms in this subclass are written &quot;f&quot; : &quot;a&quot; → &quot;b&quot;, and the composite of &quot;f&quot; : &quot;a&quot; → &quot;b&quot; and &quot;g&quot; : &quot;b&quot; → &quot;c&quot; is often written as &quot;g&quot; ∘ &quot;f&quot; or &quot;gf&quot;. 
such that the following axioms hold:
* the &quot;associative law&quot;: if &quot;f&quot; : &quot;a&quot; → &quot;b&quot;, &quot;g&quot; : &quot;b&quot; → &quot;c&quot; and &quot;h&quot; : &quot;c&quot; → &quot;d&quot; then &quot;h&quot; ∘ (&quot;g&quot; ∘ &quot;f&quot;) = (&quot;h&quot; ∘ &quot;g&quot;) ∘ &quot;f&quot;, and
* the (left and right unit laws): for every object &quot;x&quot;, there exists a morphism 1&quot;x&quot; : &quot;x&quot; → &quot;x&quot; (some authors write &quot;id&quot;&quot;x&quot;) called the &quot;identity morphism for x&quot;, such that every morphism &quot;f&quot; : &quot;a&quot; → &quot;x&quot; satisfies 1&quot;x&quot; ∘ &quot;f&quot; = &quot;f&quot;, and every morphism &quot;g&quot; : &quot;x&quot; → &quot;b&quot; satisfies &quot;g&quot; ∘ 1&quot;x&quot; = &quot;g&quot;.

We write &quot;f&quot;: &quot;a&quot; → &quot;b&quot;, and we say &quot;&quot;f&quot; is a morphism from &quot;a&quot; to &quot;b&quot;&quot;. We write hom(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) (or hom&quot;C&quot;(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) when there may be confusion about to which category hom(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) refers) to denote the hom-class of all morphisms from &quot;a&quot; to &quot;b&quot;. 

Some authors write the composite of morphisms in &quot;diagrammatic order&quot;, writing &quot;f;g&quot; or &quot;fg&quot; instead of &quot;g&quot; ∘ &quot;f&quot;.

From these axioms, one can prove that there is exactly one identity morphism for every object. Often the map assigning each object its identity morphism is treated as an extra part of the structure of a category, namely a class function i: ob(C) → mor(C). 
Some authors use a slight variant of the definition in which each object is identified with the corresponding identity morphism. This stems from the idea that the fundamental data of categories are morphisms and not objects. In fact, categories can be defined without reference to objects at all using a partial binary operation with additional properties.

==Small and large categories==

A category &quot;C&quot; is called small if both ob(&quot;C&quot;) and hom(&quot;C&quot;) are actually sets and not proper classes, and large otherwise. A locally small category is a category such that for all objects &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;, the hom-class hom(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) is a set, called a homset. Many important categories in mathematics (such as the category of sets), although not small, are at least locally small. Since, in small categories, the objects form a set, a small category can be viewed as an algebraic structure similar to a monoid but without requiring closure properties. Large categories on the other hand can be used to create &quot;structures&quot; of algebraic structures.

==Examples==
The class of all sets (as objects) together with all functions between them (as morphisms), where the composition of morphisms is the usual function composition, forms a large category, Set. It is the most basic and the most commonly used category in mathematics. The category Rel consists of all sets (as objects) with binary relations between them (as morphisms). Abstracting from relations instead of functions yields allegories, a special class of categories.

Any class can be viewed as a category whose only morphisms are the identity morphisms. Such categories are called discrete. For any given set &quot;I&quot;, the &quot;discrete category on I&quot; is the small category that has the elements of &quot;I&quot; as objects and only the identity morphisms as morphisms. Discrete categories are the simplest kind of category.

Any preordered set (&quot;P&quot;, ≤) forms a small category, where the objects are the members of &quot;P&quot;, the morphisms are arrows pointing from &quot;x&quot; to &quot;y&quot; when &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;y&quot;. Furthermore, if &quot;≤&quot; is antisymmetric, there can be at most one morphism between any two objects. The existence of identity morphisms and the composability of the morphisms are guaranteed by the reflexivity and the transitivity of the preorder. By the same argument, any partially ordered set and any equivalence relation can be seen as a small category. Any ordinal number can be seen as a category when viewed as an ordered set.

Any monoid (any algebraic structure with a single associative binary operation and an identity element) forms a small category with a single object &quot;x&quot;. (Here, &quot;x&quot; is any fixed set.) The morphisms from &quot;x&quot; to &quot;x&quot; are precisely the elements of the monoid, the identity morphism of &quot;x&quot; is the identity of the monoid, and the categorical composition of morphisms is given by the monoid operation. Several definitions and theorems about monoids may be generalized for categories.

Similarly any group can be seen as a category with a single object in which every morphism is &quot;invertible&quot;, that is, for every morphism &quot;f&quot; there is a morphism &quot;g&quot; that is both left and right inverse to &quot;f&quot; under composition. A morphism that is invertible in this sense is called an isomorphism.

A groupoid is a category in which every morphism is an isomorphism. Groupoids are generalizations of groups, group actions and equivalence relations. Actually, in the view of category the only difference between groupoid and group is that a groupoid may have more than one object but the group must have only one. Consider a topological space &quot;X&quot; and fix a base point formula_1 of &quot;X&quot;, then formula_2 is the fundamental group of the topological space &quot;X&quot; and the base point formula_1, and as a set it has the structure of group; if then let the base point formula_1 runs over all points of &quot;X&quot;, and take the union of all formula_2, then the set we get has only the structure of groupoid (which is called as the fundamental groupoid of &quot;X&quot;): two loops (under equivalence relation of homotopy) may not have the same base point so they cannot multiply with each other. In the language of category, this means here two morphisms may not have the same source object (or target object, because in this case for any morphism the source object and the target object are same: the base point) so they can not compose with each other.
Any directed graph generates a small category: the objects are the vertices of the graph, and the morphisms are the paths in the graph (augmented with loops as needed) where composition of morphisms is concatenation of paths. Such a category is called the &quot;free category&quot; generated by the graph.

The class of all preordered sets with order-preserving functions (i.e., monotone-increasing functions) as morphisms forms a category, Ord. It is a concrete category, i.e. a category obtained by adding some type of structure onto Set, and requiring that morphisms are functions that respect this added structure.

The class of all groups with group homomorphisms as morphisms and function composition as the composition operation forms a large category, Grp. Like Ord, Grp is a concrete category. The category Ab, consisting of all abelian groups and their group homomorphisms, is a full subcategory of Grp, and the prototype of an abelian category.

The class of all graphs forms another concrete category, where morphisms are graph homomorphisms (i.e., mappings between graphs which send vertices to vertices and edges to edges in a way that preserves all adjacency and incidence relations).

Other examples of concrete categories are given by the following table.

Fiber bundles with bundle maps between them form a concrete category.

The category Cat consists of all small categories, with functors between them as morphisms.

== Construction of new categories ==

=== Dual category ===
Any category &quot;C&quot; can itself be considered as a new category in a different way: the objects are the same as those in the original category but the arrows are those of the original category reversed. This is called the &quot;dual&quot; or &quot;opposite category&quot; and is denoted &quot;C&quot;op.

=== Product categories ===
If &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot; are categories, one can form the &quot;product category&quot; &quot;C&quot; × &quot;D&quot;: the objects are pairs consisting of one object from &quot;C&quot; and one from &quot;D&quot;, and the morphisms are also pairs, consisting of one morphism in &quot;C&quot; and one in &quot;D&quot;. Such pairs can be composed componentwise.

==Types of morphisms==
A morphism &quot;f&quot; : &quot;a&quot; → &quot;b&quot; is called
* a &quot;monomorphism&quot; (or &quot;monic&quot;) if it is left-cancellable, i.e. &quot;fg&quot;1 = &quot;fg&quot;2 implies &quot;g&quot;1 = &quot;g&quot;2 for all morphisms &quot;g&quot;1, &quot;g&quot;2 : &quot;x&quot; → &quot;a&quot;.
* an &quot;epimorphism&quot; (or &quot;epic&quot;) if it is right-cancellable, i.e. &quot;g&quot;1&quot;f&quot; = &quot;g&quot;2&quot;f&quot; implies &quot;g&quot;1 = &quot;g&quot;2 for all morphisms &quot;g&quot;1, &quot;g&quot;2 : &quot;b&quot; → &quot;x&quot;.
* a &quot;bimorphism&quot; if it is both a monomorphism and an epimorphism.
* a &quot;retraction&quot; if it has a right inverse, i.e. if there exists a morphism &quot;g&quot; : &quot;b&quot; → &quot;a&quot; with &quot;fg&quot; = 1&quot;b&quot;.
* a &quot;section&quot; if it has a left inverse, i.e. if there exists a morphism &quot;g&quot; : &quot;b&quot; → &quot;a&quot; with &quot;gf&quot; = 1&quot;a&quot;.
* an &quot;isomorphism&quot; if it has an inverse, i.e. if there exists a morphism &quot;g&quot; : &quot;b&quot; → &quot;a&quot; with &quot;fg&quot; = 1&quot;b&quot; and &quot;gf&quot; = 1&quot;a&quot;.
* an &quot;endomorphism&quot; if &quot;a&quot; = &quot;b&quot;. The class of endomorphisms of &quot;a&quot; is denoted end(&quot;a&quot;). For locally small categories, end(&quot;a&quot;) is a &quot;set&quot; and forms a monoid under morphism composition.
* an &quot;automorphism&quot; if &quot;f&quot; is both an endomorphism and an isomorphism. The class of automorphisms of &quot;a&quot; is denoted aut(&quot;a&quot;). For locally small categories, it forms a group under morphism composition called the &quot;automorphism group&quot; of &quot;a&quot;.

Every retraction is an epimorphism. Every section is a monomorphism. The following three statements are equivalent:
* &quot;f&quot; is a monomorphism and a retraction;
* &quot;f&quot; is an epimorphism and a section;
* &quot;f&quot; is an isomorphism.

Relations among morphisms (such as &quot;fg&quot; = &quot;h&quot;) can most conveniently be represented with commutative diagrams, where the objects are represented as points and the morphisms as arrows.

==Types of categories==
* In many categories, e.g. Ab or Vect&quot;K&quot;, the hom-sets hom(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) are not just sets but actually abelian groups, and the composition of morphisms is compatible with these group structures; i.e. is bilinear. Such a category is called preadditive. If, furthermore, the category has all finite products and coproducts, it is called an additive category. If all morphisms have a kernel and a cokernel, and all epimorphisms are cokernels and all monomorphisms are kernels, then we speak of an abelian category. A typical example of an abelian category is the category of abelian groups.
* A category is called complete if all small limits exist in it. The categories of sets, abelian groups and topological spaces are complete.
* A category is called cartesian closed if it has finite direct products and a morphism defined on a finite product can always be represented by a morphism defined on just one of the factors. Examples include Set and CPO, the category of complete partial orders with Scott-continuous functions.
* A topos is a certain type of cartesian closed category in which all of mathematics can be formulated (just like classically all of mathematics is formulated in the category of sets). A topos can also be used to represent a logical theory.

<text>James David Graham Niven (; 1 March 1910 – 29 July 1983) was an English actor, soldier, raconteur, memoirist and novelist. Niven was known as a handsome and debonair leading man in Classic Hollywood films. He received an Academy Award and was twice the winner of a Golden Globe Award.

Born in central London to an upper-middle-class family, Niven attended Heatherdown Preparatory School and Stowe School before gaining a place at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. After Sandhurst, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Highland Light Infantry. Upon developing an interest in acting, he found a role as an extra in the British film &quot;There Goes the Bride&quot; (1932). Bored with the peacetime army, he resigned his commission in 1933, relocated to New York, then travelled to Hollywood. There, he hired an agent and had several small parts in films through 1935, including a non-speaking role in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer&#x27;s &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot; (1935). This helped him gain a contract with Samuel Goldwyn.

Parts, initially small, in major motion pictures followed, including &quot;Dodsworth&quot; (1936), &quot;The Charge of the Light Brigade&quot; (1936), and &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot; (1937). By 1938, he was starring as a leading man in films such as &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; (1939). Upon the outbreak of the Second World War, Niven returned to Britain and rejoined the army, being recommissioned as a lieutenant. In 1942, he co-starred in the morale-building film about the development of the renowned Supermarine Spitfire fighter plane, &quot;The First of the Few&quot; (1942).

Niven went on to receive the Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in &quot;Separate Tables&quot; (1958). His other notable films during this time period include &quot;A Matter of Life and Death&quot; (1946), &quot;The Bishop&#x27;s Wife&quot; (1947), &quot;Enchantment&quot; (1948), &quot;The Elusive Pimpernel&quot; (1950), &quot;The Moon Is Blue&quot; (1953), &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot; (1956), &quot;My Man Godfrey&quot; (1957), &quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot; (1961), &quot;Murder by Death&quot; (1976), and &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; (1978). He also earned acclaim and notoriety playing Sir Charles Lytton in &quot;The Pink Panther&quot; (1963) and James Bond in &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (1967).

==Early life and family==
James David Graham Niven was born on 1 March 1910 at Belgrave Mansions, Grosvenor Gardens, London, to William Edward Graham Niven (1878–1915) and his wife, Henrietta Julia (née Degacher) Niven (1878–1932). He was named David after his birth on St David&#x27;s Day. Niven later claimed he was born in Kirriemuir, in the Scottish county of Angus in 1909, but his birth certificate disproves this. He had two older sisters and a brother: Margaret Joyce Niven (1900–1981), Henry Degacher Niven (1902–1953), and the sculptor Grizel Rosemary Graham Niven (1906–2007), who created the bronze sculpture &quot;Bessie&quot; that is presented to the annual winners of the Women&#x27;s Prize for Fiction.

Niven&#x27;s father, William Niven, was of Scottish descent; he was killed in the First World War serving with the Berkshire Yeomanry during the Gallipoli campaign on 21 August 1915. He is buried in Green Hill Cemetery, Turkey, in the Special Memorial Section in Plot F. 10. Niven&#x27;s paternal great-grandfather and namesake, David Graham Niven, (1811–1884) was from St Martins, a village in Perthshire. A physician, he married in Worcestershire, and lived in Pershore.

Niven&#x27;s mother, Henriette, was born in Brecon, Wales. Her father was Captain (brevet Major) William Degacher (1841–1879) of the 1st Battalion, 24th Regiment of Foot, who was killed at the Battle of Isandlwana during the Anglo-Zulu War in 1879. Although born William Hitchcock, in 1874, he and his older brother Lieutenant Colonel Henry Degacher (1835–1902), both followed their father, Walter Henry Hitchcock, in taking their mother&#x27;s maiden name of Degacher. Henriette&#x27;s mother was Julia Caroline Smith, the daughter of Lieutenant General James Webber Smith CB.

After her husband&#x27;s death in Turkey in 1915, Henrietta Niven remarried in London in 1917 to Conservative politician and diplomat Sir Thomas Walter Comyn-Platt (1869–1961). David and his sister Grizel were close, and both loathed Comyn-Platt. The family moved to Rose Cottage in Bembridge on the Isle of Wight after selling their London home. In his 1971 biography, &quot;The Moon&#x27;s a Balloon&quot;, Niven wrote fondly of his childhood home:
It became necessary for the house in London to be sold and our permanent address was now as advertised—a cottage which had a reputation for unreliability. When the East wind blew, the front door got stuck and when the West wind blew, the back door could not be opened—only the combined weight of the family seemed to keep it anchored to the ground. I adored it and was happier there than I had ever been, especially because, with a rare flash of genius, my mother decided that during the holidays she would be alone with her children. Uncle Tommy [Comyn-Platt] was barred—I don&#x27;t know where he went—to the Carlton Club I suppose.
Literary editor and biographer, Graham Lord, wrote in &quot;Niv: The Authorised Biography of David Niven&quot;, that Comyn-Platt and Niven&#x27;s mother may have been in an affair well before her husband&#x27;s death in 1915 and that Comyn-Platt was actually Niven&#x27;s biological father, a supposition that had some support among Niven&#x27;s siblings. In a review of Lord&#x27;s book, Hugh Massingberd from &quot;The Spectator&quot; stated photographic evidence did show a strong physical resemblance between Niven and Comyn-Platt that &quot;would appear to confirm these theories, though photographs can often be misleading.&quot; Niven is said to have revealed that he knew Comyn-Platt was his real father a year before his own death in 1983.

After his mother remarried, Niven&#x27;s stepfather had him sent away to boarding school. In &quot;The Moon&#x27;s a Balloon&quot;, Niven described the bullying, isolation, and abuse he endured as a six-year-old. He said that older pupils would regularly assault younger boys, while the schoolmasters were not much better. Niven wrote of one sadistic teacher:

Mr Croome, when he tired of pulling ears halfway out of our heads (I still have one that sticks out almost at right-angles thanks to this son of a bitch) and delivering, for the smallest mistake in Latin declension, backhanded slaps that knocked one off one&#x27;s bench, delighted in saying, &#x27;Show me the hand that wrote this&#x27; — then bringing down the sharp edge of a heavy ruler across the offending wrist.

Years later, after joining the British Army, a vengeful Niven decided to return to the boarding school to pay a call on Mr Croome but he found the place abandoned and empty.
While attending schoolas was customary for the timeNiven received many instances of corporal punishment owing to his inclination for pranks. It was this behaviour that finally led to his expulsion from his next school, Heatherdown Preparatory School, at the age of . This ended his chances for Eton College, a significant blow to his family. After failing to pass the naval entrance exam because of his difficulty with maths, Niven attended Stowe School, a newly created public school led by headmaster J. F. Roxburgh, who was unlike any of Niven&#x27;s previous headmasters. Thoughtful and kind, he addressed the boys by their first names, allowed them bicycles, and encouraged and nurtured their personal interests. Niven later wrote, &quot;How he did this, I shall never know, but he made every single boy at that school feel that what he said and what he did were of real importance to the headmaster.&quot;

In 1928, while she was on holiday in Bembridge, 15-year-old Margaret Whigham (the future socialite and Duchess of Argyll) had a sexual encounter with 18-year-old Niven, resulting in her pregnancy. Furious, her father rushed her to a London nursing home for a secret abortion. &quot;All hell broke loose,&quot; remembered Elizabeth Duckworth, the Whigham family cook. Margaret Whigham adored Niven until the day he died; she was among the VIP guests at his London memorial service in 1983.

==Military service==
From 1928, Niven attended the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. He did well at Sandhurst, which gave him the &quot;officer and gentleman&quot; bearing that was his trademark. He requested assignment to the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders or the Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment), then jokingly wrote on the form, as his third choice, &quot;anything but the Highland Light Infantry&quot; (because that regiment wore tartan trews rather than the kilt). Having completed his training, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the British Army on 30 January 1930, and assigned to the Highland Light Infantry (HLI). He served with them for two years in Malta and then for a few months in Dover. In Malta, he became friends with the maverick Michael Trubshawe, and served under Roy Urquhart, future commander of the British 1st Airborne Division. On 21 October 1956, in an episode of the game show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;, Niven, as a member of the celebrity panel, was reacquainted with one of his former enlisted men. Alexander McGeachin was a guest and when his turn in the questioning came up, Niven asked, &quot;Were you in a famous British regiment on Malta?&quot; After McGeachin affirmed that he was, Niven quipped, &quot;Did you have the misfortune to have me as your officer?&quot; At that point, Niven had a brief but pleasant reunion.

Niven grew tired of the peacetime army. Though promoted to lieutenant on 1 January 1933, he saw no opportunity for further advancement. His ultimate decision to resign came after a lengthy lecture on machine guns, which was interfering with his plans for dinner with a particularly attractive young lady. At the end of the lecture, the speaker (a major general) asked if there were any questions. Showing the typical rebelliousness of his early years, Niven asked, &quot;Could you tell me the time, sir? I have to catch a train.&quot;

Lieutenant Niven resigned his commission on 6 September 1933.

==Film career==

=== 1935–1938: Early roles ===
When Niven presented himself at Central Casting, he learned that he needed a work permit to reside and work in the United States. Since this required leaving the US, he went to Mexico, where he worked as a &quot;gun-man&quot;, cleaning and polishing the rifles of visiting American hunters. He received his resident alien visa from the American consulate when his birth certificate arrived from Britain. He returned to the US and was accepted by Central Casting as &quot;Anglo-Saxon Type No. 2,008.&quot; Among the initial films in which he can be seen are &quot;Barbary Coast&quot; (1935) and &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot; (1935). He secured a small role in &quot;A Feather in Her Hat&quot; (1935) at Columbia before returning to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for a bit role, billed as David Nivens, in &quot;Rose Marie&quot; (1936).

Niven&#x27;s role in &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot; brought him to the attention of independent film producer Samuel Goldwyn, who signed him to a contract and established his career. For Goldwyn, Niven again had a small role in &quot;Splendor&quot; (1935). He was lent to MGM for a minor part in &quot;Rose Marie&quot; (1936), then a larger one in &quot;Palm Springs&quot; (1936) for Paramount Pictures. His first sizable role for Goldwyn came in &quot;Dodsworth&quot; (1936). In that same year he was again loaned out, to 20th Century Fox to play Bertie Wooster in &quot;Thank You, Jeeves!&quot; (1936), before landing a significant role as a soldier in &quot;The Charge of the Light Brigade&quot; (1936) at Warner Brothers, an Imperial adventure film starring his housemate at the time, Errol Flynn. Niven was fourth billed in &quot;Beloved Enemy&quot; (1936) for Goldwyn, supporting Merle Oberon with whom he was romantically involved. Universal Pictures used him in &quot;We Have Our Moments&quot; (1937) and he had a good supporting role in David O. Selznick&#x27;s &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot; (1937).

===1938–1939: Leading man===

Fox Studios gave him the lead in a B picture, &quot;Dinner at the Ritz&quot; (1938) and he again had a supporting role in &quot;Bluebeard&#x27;s Eighth Wife&quot; (1938) directed by Ernst Lubitsch at Paramount. Niven was one of the four heroes in John Ford&#x27;s &quot;Four Men and a Prayer&quot; (1938), also with Fox. He remained with Fox to play the part of a fake love interest in &quot;Three Blind Mice&quot; (1938). Niven joined what became known as the Hollywood Raj, a group of British actors in Hollywood which included Gladys Cooper, Cedric Hardwicke, Boris Karloff, Stan Laurel, Basil Rathbone, Ronald Colman, Leslie Howard, and C. Aubrey Smith. 

Niven graduated to star parts in &quot;A&quot; films with &quot;The Dawn Patrol&quot; (1938) remake at Warners; although he was billed below Flynn and Rathbone, it was a leading role and the film did excellent business. Niven was reluctant to take part in &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; (1939) for Goldwyn, but eventually relented and the film was a big success. RKO borrowed him to play Ginger Rogers&#x27; leading man in the romantic comedy &quot;Bachelor Mother&quot; (1939), which was another big hit. Goldwyn used him to support Gary Cooper in the adventure tale &quot;The Real Glory&quot; (1939), and Walter Wanger cast him opposite Loretta Young in &quot;Eternally Yours&quot; (1939). Finally, Goldwyn granted Niven a lead part in a major film, the title role as the eponymous gentleman safecracker in &quot;Raffles&quot; (1939).

=== 1939–1945: Second World War ===
The day after Britain declared war on Germany in 1939, Niven returned home and rejoined the British Army. He was alone among British stars in Hollywood in doing so; the British Embassy advised most actors to stay.

Niven was recommissioned as a lieutenant in the Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort&#x27;s Own) on 25 February 1940, and was assigned to a motor training battalion. He wanted something more exciting, however, and transferred to the Commandos. He was assigned to a training base at Inverailort House in the Western Highlands. Niven later claimed credit for bringing future Major General Sir Robert Laycock to the Commandos. Niven commanded &quot;A&quot; Squadron GHQ Liaison Regiment, better known as &quot;Phantom&quot;. He was promoted to war-substantive captain on 18 August 1941.

Niven also worked with the Army Film and Photographic Unit. His work included a small part in the deception operation that used minor actor M. E. Clifton James to impersonate General Sir Bernard Montgomery. During his work with the AFPU, Peter Ustinov, one of the scriptwriters, had to pose as Niven&#x27;s batman. Niven explained in his autobiography that there was no military way that he, a lieutenant-colonel, and Ustinov, who was only a private, could associate, other than as an officer and his subordinate, hence their strange &quot;act&quot;. In 1978, Niven and Ustinov would star together in a film adaptation of Agatha Christie&#x27;s &quot;Death on the Nile&quot;.

He acted in two wartime films not formally associated with the AFPU, but both made with a firm view to winning support for the British war effort, especially in the United States. These were &quot;The First of the Few&quot; (1942), directed by Leslie Howard, and &quot;The Way Ahead&quot; (1944), directed by Carol Reed, the latter of which included a large supporting role for Ustinov.

Niven was also given a significant if largely unheralded role in the creation of SHAEF&#x27;s military radio efforts conceived to provide entertainment to British, Canadian, and American forces in England and in Europe. In 1944 he worked extensively with the BBC and SHAEF to expand these broadcast efforts. He also worked extensively with Major Glenn Miller, whose Army Air Force big band, formed in the US, was performing and broadcasting for troops in England. Niven played a role in the operation to move the Miller band to France prior to Miller&#x27;s December 1944 disappearance while flying over the English Channel.

On 14 March 1944, Niven was promoted war-substantive major (temporary lieutenant-colonel). He took part in the Allied invasion of Normandy in June 1944, although he was sent to France several days after D-Day. He served in &quot;Phantom&quot;, a secret reconnaissance and signals unit which located and reported enemy positions, and kept rear commanders informed on changing battle lines. Niven was posted at one time to Chilham in Kent.
Niven had particular scorn for those newspaper columnists covering the war who typed out self-glorifying and excessively florid prose about their meagre wartime experiences. Niven stated, &quot;Anyone who says a bullet sings past, hums past, flies, pings, or whines past, has never heard onethey go &quot;crack&quot;!&quot; He gave a few details of his war experience in his autobiography, &quot;The Moon&#x27;s a Balloon:&quot; his private conversations with Winston Churchill, the bombing of London, and what it was like entering Germany with the occupation forces. Niven first met Churchill at a dinner party in February 1940. Churchill singled him out from the crowd and stated, &quot;Young man, you did a fine thing to give up your film career to fight for your country. Mark you, had you not done so it would have been despicable.&quot;

A few stories have surfaced. About to lead his men into action, Niven eased their nervousness by telling them, &quot;Look, you chaps only have to do this once. But I&#x27;ll have to do it all over again in Hollywood with Errol Flynn!&quot; Asked by suspicious American sentries during the Battle of the Bulge who had won the World Series in 1943, he answered, &quot;Haven&#x27;t the foggiest idea, but I did co-star with Ginger Rogers in &quot;Bachelor Mother&quot;!&quot;

Niven ended the war as a lieutenant-colonel. On his return to Hollywood after the war, he received the Legion of Merit, an American military decoration in honour of Niven&#x27;s work setting up the BBC Allied Expeditionary Forces Programme, a radio news and entertainment station for the Allied forces.

===1946–1950: Postwar career===
Niven initially resumed his acting career in England, taking the lead in the classic, &quot;A Matter of Life and Death&quot; (1946), from the team of Powell and Pressburger. The film was critically acclaimed, popular in England, and selected as the first Royal Film Performance. Niven returned to Hollywood but soon encountered tragedy with the death of his wife after falling down a flight of stairs at a party, and it was around this time that his career began to suffer as well. Goldwyn lent him to Universal to play Aaron Burr in &quot;Magnificent Doll&quot; (1946) opposite Ginger Rogers, then lent him to Paramount for &quot;The Perfect Marriage&quot; (1947) with Loretta Young and loaned him out a third time for Enterprise Productions&#x27; &quot;The Other Love&quot; (1947) opposite Barbara Stanwyck. Finally he was cast in a top picture for Goldwyn when he joined Cary Grant and Loretta Young for &quot;The Bishop&#x27;s Wife&quot; (1947).

Any prospects for career advancement were quickly dashed when Goldwyn lent him to Alexander Korda to return to the UK for the title role in &quot;Bonnie Prince Charlie&quot; (1948), a notorious flop. Back in Hollywood, Niven was in Goldwyn&#x27;s well-regarded &quot;Enchantment&quot; (1948) with Teresa Wright. At Warner Bros he was in a comedy &quot;A Kiss in the Dark&quot; (1948) with Jane Wyman, then he appeared opposite Shirley Temple in the comedy &quot;A Kiss for Corliss&quot; (1949). None of these films was successful at the box office. Niven&#x27;s career was markedly in decline.

He returned to Britain for the title role in &quot;The Elusive Pimpernel&quot; (1950) from Powell and Pressberger, which was to have been financed by Korda and Goldwyn. Goldwyn pulled out and the film did not appear in the US for three years. Niven had a long, complex relationship with Goldwyn, who gave him his start, but Niven&#x27;s demands for more money and better roles led to a long estrangement.

=== 1951–1964: Renewed acclaim ===

In his post-Goldwyn years, it took Niven some time to return to the top of the Hollywood ladder. Foundering, he supported Mario Lanza in a musical at MGM, &quot;The Toast of New Orleans&quot; (1950). He then went to England to star in a musical with Vera-Ellen, &quot;Happy Go Lovely&quot; (1951); it was little seen in the US but a big hit in Britain. He was reduced to a support role in MGM&#x27;s &quot;Soldiers Three&quot; (1951) not unlike some of the assignments early in his career. Niven had a far better part in the British war film &quot;Appointment with Venus&quot; (1952), which was popular in England. &quot;The Lady Says No&quot; (1952) was a poorly received American comedy. Niven tried Broadway, appearing opposite Gloria Swanson in &quot;Nina&quot; (1951–52). The play ran for only 45 performances but it was seen by Otto Preminger, who decided to cast Niven in the film version &quot;The Moon Is Blue&quot; (1953). As preparation Preminger, who had directed the play in New York, insisted that Niven appear on stage in the West Coast run. &quot;The Moon Is Blue&quot;, a sex comedy, became notorious when it was released without a Production Code Seal of Approval; it was a major hit and Niven won a Golden Globe Award for his role.

Back in demand, Niven&#x27;s next few films were made in England: &quot;The Love Lottery&quot; (1954), an Ealing comedy; &quot;Carrington V.C.&quot; (1954), a drama that earned Niven a BAFTA nomination for Best Actor; and &quot;Happy Ever After&quot; (1954), a comedy with Yvonne de Carlo, which was hugely popular in Britain. In Hollywood, he was seen as the villain in an MGM swashbuckler, &quot;The King&#x27;s Thief&quot; (1955) opposite a young Roger Moore. He had a better part in &quot;The Birds and the Bees&quot; (1956), portraying a conman in a remake of &quot;The Lady Eve&quot; (1941), in which Niven played a third-billed supporting role under American television comedian George Gobel and leading lady Mitzi Gaynor. Niven also appeared in the British romantic comedy &quot;The Silken Affair&quot; (1956) with Geneviève Page the same year.

Niven&#x27;s professional fortunes were fully restored when he starred as Phileas Fogg in &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot; (1956), a huge hit at the box office and his signature film; it won the Academy Award for Best Picture. He followed it with &quot;Oh, Men! Oh, Women!&quot; (1957); &quot;The Little Hut&quot; (1957), from the writer of &quot;The Moon is Blue&quot; and another success at the box office; &quot;My Man Godfrey&quot; (1957), a screwball comedy; and &quot;Bonjour Tristesse&quot; (1958), for Preminger. Niven also worked in television. He appeared several times on various short-drama shows and was one of the &quot;four stars&quot; of the dramatic anthology series &quot;Four Star Playhouse&quot;, appearing in 33 episodes. The show was produced by Four Star Television, which was owned and founded by Niven, Ida Lupino, Dick Powell, and Charles Boyer. The show ended in 1955, but Four Star became a highly successful TV production company.

Niven is the only person to win an Academy Award at the ceremony he was hosting. He won the 1959 Academy Award for Best Actor for his role as Major David Angus Pollock in &quot;Separate Tables&quot;, his only nomination for an Oscar. Appearing on-screen for only 23 minutes in the film, this is the briefest performance ever to win a Best Actor Oscar. He was also a co-host of the 30th, 31st, and 46th Academy Awards ceremonies. After Niven had won the Academy Award, Goldwyn called with an invitation to his home. In Goldwyn&#x27;s drawing-room, Niven noticed a picture of himself in uniform which he had sent to Goldwyn from Britain during the Second World War. In happier times with Goldwyn, he had observed this same picture sitting on Goldwyn&#x27;s piano. Now years later, the picture was still in exactly the same spot. As he was looking at the picture, Goldwyn&#x27;s wife Frances said, &quot;Sam never took it down.&quot; 

With an Oscar to his credit, Niven&#x27;s career continued to thrive. In 1959, he became the host of his own TV drama series, &quot;The David Niven Show&quot;, but he was still starring in major films. He led in &quot;Ask Any Girl&quot; (1959), with Shirley MacLaine; the Carl Reiner-scripted &quot;Happy Anniversary&quot; (1959) opposite Mitzi Gaynor; and &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Eat the Daisies&quot; (1960) with Doris Day, a huge hit.
Even more popular was the action film &quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot; (1961) with Gregory Peck and Anthony Quinn. This role led to the ex-soldier being cast in further war and/or action films: &quot;The Captive City&quot; (1962); &quot;The Best of Enemies&quot; (1962); &quot;Guns of Darkness&quot; (1962); and &quot;55 Days at Peking&quot; (1963) with Charlton Heston and Ava Gardner. Niven returned to comedy with &quot;The Pink Panther&quot; (1963) also starring Peter Sellers, another huge success at the box office. Less so was the comedy &quot;Bedtime Story&quot; (1964) with Marlon Brando, later remade with Michael Caine in a very Nivenish performance under the title &quot;Dirty Rotten Scoundrels&quot;. In 1964, Charles Boyer, Gig Young, and top-billed Niven appeared in the Four Star series &quot;The Rogues&quot; for NBC. Niven played Alexander &#x27;Alec&#x27; Fleming, one of a family of retired con-artists who now fleece villains in the interests of justice. This was his only recurring role on television, and the series was originally set up to more or less revolve between the three leads in various combinations (one-lead, two-lead and three-lead episodes), although in the event, Gig Young, being the least busy, carried most of the series, with an assist from Larry Hagman. &quot;The Rogues&quot; ran for one season and won a Golden Globe.

=== 1965–1983: Later films ===
In 1965, Niven made two films for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer: the Peter Ustinov-directed &quot;Lady L&quot; with Paul Newman and Sophia Loren, and &quot;Where the Spies Are&quot;, as a doctor-turned-secret agent. After the horror film &quot;Eye of the Devil&quot; (1966), Niven went the secret agent route again, appearing as James Bond in the hit &quot;Casino Royale&quot; in 1967. He remains, with the exception of Sean Connery in &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot;, the only other man to portray Bond in a non-Eon Productions film. Niven had been Bond creator Ian Fleming&#x27;s choice to play Bond in &quot;Dr. No&quot;. &quot;Casino Royale&quot; co-producer Charles K. Feldman said later that Fleming had written the book with Niven in mind, and therefore had sent a copy to Niven. Niven is the only actor who played James Bond to be mentioned by name in the text of a Fleming novel. In chapter 14 of &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;, pearl diver Kissy Suzuki refers to Niven as &quot;the only man she liked in Hollywood&quot;, and the only person who &quot;treated her honourably&quot; there.

Niven made two popular comedies, &quot;Prudence and the Pill&quot; (1968) and &quot;The Impossible Years&quot; (1968). Less widely seen was the offbeat &quot;The Extraordinary Seaman&quot; for John Frankenheimer in 1969. &quot;The Brain&quot;, a French comedy with Bourvil and Jean-Paul Belmondo, was the most popular film at the French box office in 1969. He did a war drama &quot;Before Winter Comes&quot; (1969) next, followed by a return to comedy in &quot;The Statue&quot; (1971). 

Buoyed by the massive success of his best-selling memoir, &quot;The Moon&#x27;s a Balloon&quot;, Niven was in demand throughout the last decade of his life. &quot;King, Queen, Knave&quot; (1972) and &quot;Vampira&quot; (1974) were followed by one of the most enduring images of Niven. While hosting the 46th Annual Oscars ceremony, a naked man (Robert Opel) appeared behind Niven, &quot;streaking&quot; across the stage. In what instantly became a live-TV classic moment, a bemused Niven responded, &quot;Isn&#x27;t it fascinating to think that probably the only laugh that man will ever get in his life is by stripping off and showing his shortcomings?&quot; That same year, he hosted &quot;David Niven&#x27;s World&quot; for LWT, which profiled contemporary adventurers such as hang gliders, motorcyclists, and mountain climbers: it ran for 21 episodes. In 1975, he narrated &quot;The Remarkable Rocket&quot;, a short animation based on a story by Oscar Wilde. 

Continuing with his film career, he starred in the highly-regarded drama &quot;Paper Tiger&quot; (1975) and a Disney comedy, &quot;No Deposit, No Return&quot; (1976), while at the same time appearing in lucrative TV commercials for cologne and coffee in Asia, setting a trend that carries on with major North American film stars today. The all-star mystery spoof &quot;Murder By Death&quot; (1976) followed, after which came a better Disney outing, &quot;Candleshoe&quot; (1977), alongside Jodie Foster and Helen Hayes, and then the first of the all-star Ustinov-as-Poirot films, &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; (1978). &quot;A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square&quot; (1979); &quot;Escape to Athena&quot; (1979), another all-star effort, this time with his son as producer; then the far-better-than-usual Burt Reynolds vehicle &quot;Rough Cut&quot; (1980), and finally &quot;The Sea Wolves&quot; (1980), a wartime adventure film, rounded out his peak years. By the last two, and his TV mini-series A Man Called Intrepid (1979), Niven&#x27;s declining health was becoming evident.

Niven&#x27;s last leading role was in &quot;Better Late Than Never&quot; (1983). In July 1982, Blake Edwards brought an ailing Niven back for cameos in two &quot;Pink Panther&quot; films shot at the same time (&quot;Trail of the Pink Panther&quot; and &quot;Curse of the Pink Panther&quot;), reprising his role as Sir Charles Lytton. By the time of filming, Niven was fully in the throes of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and his voice was no longer usable. His lines were dubbed, however inadequately, on short notice, by Rich Little. Niven only learned of it from a newspaper report.

==Writing==

Niven wrote four books. The first, &quot;Round the Rugged Rocks&quot;, was a novel that appeared in 1951, when his film career was at its nadir, and was forgotten immediately. The plot was plainly autobiographical (although not recognised as such at the time of publication), involving a young soldier, John Hamilton, who leaves the British Army, becomes a liquor salesman in New York, is involved in indoor horse racing, goes to Hollywood, becomes a deckhand on a fishing boat, and finally ends up as a highly successful film star.

In 1971, he published his autobiography, &quot;The Moon&#x27;s a Balloon&quot;, selling over five million copies. He followed this with &quot;Bring On the Empty Horses&quot; in 1975, a collection of entertaining reminiscences from the Golden Age of Hollywood in the 1930s and 1940s. As a raconteur rather than an accurate memoirist, Niven recounted some incidents from a first-person perspective that happened to other people, among them Cary Grant. This borrowing and embroidering of his personal history was also said to be the reason why he persistently refused to appear on &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;. Niven&#x27;s penchant for exaggeration is particularly apparent when comparing his written descriptions of his early film appearances (especially &quot;Barbary Coast&quot; and &quot;A Feather in her Hat&quot;), and his Oscar acceptance speech, to the filmed evidence. In all three examples, the reality differs from Niven&#x27;s accounts as presented in &quot;The Moon&#x27;s a Balloon&quot; and related in various chat show appearances.

In 1981 Niven published a second and much more successful novel, &quot;Go Slowly, Come Back Quickly&quot;, which was set during and after the Second World War, and which drew on his experiences during the war and in Hollywood.

==Personal life==
While on leave in 1940, Niven met Primula &quot;Primmie&quot; Susan Rollo (18 February 1918 – 21 May 1946), the daughter of London lawyer William H.C. Rollo. After a whirlwind romance, they married on 16 September 1940. A son, David Jr., was born in December 1942 and a second son, James Graham Niven, on 6 November 1945. Primmie died at the age of 28, six weeks after the family moved to the US. She fractured her skull in a fall in the Beverly Hills home of Tyrone Power and Annabella, while playing a game of sardines. She had walked through a door believing it to be a closet, but instead, it led to a stone staircase to the basement.

In 1948, Niven met and married Hjördis Paulina Tersmeden (née Genberg, 1919–1997), a divorced Swedish fashion model. He recounted their meeting:
The relationship between Niven and Hjördis was turbulent.

In 1960, Niven bought a chalet in Château-d&#x27;Œx near Gstaad in Switzerland, living near expatriate friends including Deborah Kerr, Peter Ustinov, and Noël Coward. It is believed that Niven&#x27;s choice to become a tax exile may have been one reason why he never received a British honour. However, Kerr, Ustinov, and Coward were honoured. A 2009 biography of Niven contained assertions that he had an affair with Princess Margaret, who was 20 years his junior. He also became close friends with William F. Buckley Jr. and his wife Pat; Buckley wrote a memorial tribute to him in &quot;Miles Gone By&quot; (2004).

Eventually Niven divided his time between his chalet in Château-d&#x27;Œx and his home at Cap Ferrat on the Côte d&#x27;Azur in the south of France.

==Death and legacy ==
In 1978 Niven began experiencing weight loss, and by 1980 general fatigue, muscle weakness, and slurred speech. His interviews on the talk shows of Michael Parkinson and Merv Griffin alarmed family and friends; viewers wondered if Niven had either been drinking or suffered a stroke. He blamed his slightly slurred voice on the shooting schedule of the film he had been making, &quot;Better Late Than Never&quot;. He was diagnosed with ALS in 1980. His final appearance in Hollywood was hosting the 1981 American Film Institute tribute to his old friend Fred Astaire.

In February 1983, using a false name to avoid publicity, Niven was hospitalised for 10 days, ostensibly for a digestive problem. Afterwards, he returned to his chalet at Château-d&#x27;Œx. Though his condition continued to worsen he refused to return to the hospital, a decision supported by his family. He died at his chalet on 29 July 1983, aged 73. Niven was buried on 2 August in the local cemetery of Château-d&#x27;Œx.

A thanksgiving service for Niven was held at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, on 27 October 1983. The congregation of 1,200 included Prince Michael of Kent, Margaret Campbell, Duchess of Argyll, John Mills, Richard Attenborough, Trevor Howard, David Frost, Joanna Lumley, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., and Laurence Olivier. Biographer Graham Lord wrote, &quot;the biggest wreath, worthy of a Mafia Godfather&#x27;s funeral, was delivered from the porters at London&#x27;s Heathrow Airport, along with a card that read: &#x27;To the finest gentleman who ever walked through these halls. He made a porter feel like a king.

In 1985, Niven was included in a series of British postage stamps, along with Alfred Hitchcock, Charles Chaplin, Peter Sellers, and Vivien Leigh, to commemorate &quot;British Film Year&quot;. Niven&#x27;s appearance was the inspiration for that of Commander Norman in the &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; franchise, as well as DC Comics villain Sinestro.

Niven&#x27;s &quot;Bonjour Tristesse&quot; co-star, Mylène Demongeot, declared about him, in a 2015 filmed interview:&quot;He was like a Lord, he was part of those great actors who were extraordinary like Dirk Bogarde, individuals with lots of class, elegance and humour. I only saw David get angry once. Preminger had discharged him for the day but eventually asked to get him. I said, sir, you had discharged him, he left for Deauville to gamble at the casino. So we rented a helicopter so they immediately went and grabbed him. Two hours later, he was back, full of rage. There I saw David lose his British phlegm, his politeness and class. It was royal. [Laughs].&quot;

<text>The Rubettes are an English pop/glam rock band put together in 1974 after the release of &quot;Sugar Baby Love&quot;, a recording assembled of studio session musicians in 1973 by the songwriting team of Wayne Bickerton, the then head of A&amp;R at Polydor Records, and his co-songwriter, Tony Waddington after their doo-wop and 1950s American pop-influenced songs had been rejected by a number of existing acts. Waddington paired the group with manager John Morris, the husband of singer Clodagh Rodgers and under his guidance, the band duly emerged at the tail end of the glam rock movement, wearing trademark white suits and cloth caps on stage. Their first release, &quot;Sugar Baby Love&quot; was an instant hit remaining at number one in the United Kingdom for four weeks in May 1974, while reaching number 37 on the US chart that August, and remains their best-known record. Subsequent releases were to be less successful, but the band continued to tour well into the 2000s with two line-ups in existence.

==History==
===Classic era (1974–1980)===
The Rubettes&#x27; first and biggest hit was &quot;Sugar Baby Love&quot; (1974) which was a number one in the United Kingdom, going on to sell around 500,000 copies in the UK and three million copies globally. With three more songs, &quot;Sugar Baby Love&quot; was recorded for Polydor in October 1973 at Lansdowne Studios in Holland Park, London, by a group of session musicians featuring the distinctive falsetto and lead vocals of Paul Da Vinci (born: Paul Leonard Prewer). However, Da Vinci did not join the others to become a member of the band put together by John Richardson, and instead pursued solo work, having signed a contract with Penny Farthing Records. &quot;Sugar Baby Love&quot; was their only UK No. 1 and sole US Top 40 entry.

For public appearances to promote the song, initially on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, Alan Williams took on the role of lead singer, being the only one of the original session singers able to duplicate Da Vinci&#x27;s falsetto vocals. The Rubettes then comprised Williams, Richardson, and Pete Arnesen (all three of whom had participated in the original recording) together with Tony Thorpe, Mick Clarke, and Bill Hurd. In performance, the group wore distinctive white suits and white caps which, according to Williams, &quot;were a practical addition to the ensemble.. [as] we all had long hair, which didn&#x27;t suit the image we&#x27;d gone for.. We compromised by having our hair pinned up inside the caps...&quot;.

Williams sang lead on later recordings, and the Rubettes went on to have a number of other top ten hits across Europe during the mid-1970s, such as &quot;Tonight&quot;, &quot;Juke Box Jive&quot; and &quot;I Can Do It&quot;, mostly written by the Bickerton–Waddington songwriting team. The Rubettes&#x27; success encouraged Bickerton and Waddington to set up State Records, so that ten months after the release of &quot;Sugar Baby Love&quot;, the fourth Rubettes single &quot;I Can Do It&quot; was on State (catalogue reference STAT 1). In November 1974, &quot;NME&quot; music magazine reported that The Rubettes, The Glitter Band and Mud were among the UK bands who had roles in a new film titled &quot;Never Too Young to Rock&quot;.

In 1976 the band abandoned glam nostalgia to enter more serious territory. &quot;Under One Roof&quot; (1976) sung by John Richardson was a portrayal of a gay man disowned and later murdered by his father; along with Rod Stewart&#x27;s &quot;The Killing of Georgie&quot; (1976), it was one of the few songs that tackled the topic of homophobia. Their most successful self-composed hit was the country rock styled ballad &quot;Baby I Know&quot; (1977) sung by Tony Thorpe, which reached number 10 in the UK and Germany in 1977. During this period the band continued to cater for the much bigger European market by continuing to release more commercial pop singles all featuring lead vocals by Alan Williams such as &quot;Julia&quot; (1976), &quot;Allez Oop&quot; (1976), and &quot;Ooh La La&quot; (1977). The band became a quintet in early 1975 with the departure of Arnesen, and later became a quartet in mid-1976 when Hurd departed the band; to this day the original band has never expanded its line-up beyond four members. Whilst the band continued as a four-piece; Hurd joined Suzi Quatro&#x27;s band, touring and playing on a number of worldwide hits, which included the Top 20 success &quot;She&#x27;s in Love with You&quot; in 1979, before re-joining the Rubettes in 1982.

In another attempt to get away from the &#x27;doo-wop&#x27; glam image, Thorpe insisted that the trademark vocal harmonies were left off of his composition, &quot;You&#x27;re the Reason Why&quot;. Gerry Shury and the band out-voted him. The version with no vocal backing has been available as a bootleg recording in certain parts of Europe. In 1979, Thorpe and the band separated over musical differences. Thorpe can be heard on lead vocals on the last &quot;Still Unwinding&quot; track, &quot;Does It Gotta Be Rock &#x27;N&#x27; Roll&quot;. His guitar parts and backing vocals remained. After Thorpe&#x27;s departure, the group&#x27;s success began to dwindle. The band replaced Thorpe with Bob Benham, but he departed shortly thereafter and the band dissolved in 1980.

===Reformation (1982–1999)===
The band reformed in 1982, with a line-up consisting of Williams, Clark, Hurd, and drummer Alex Bines to exploit the German market for 1970s nostalgia. This line-up remained relatively stable until 1999, with the only line-up changes being the departure of Clark in 1987, to be replaced first by Steve Kinch and then by Trevor Holliday, before he returned to the fold in 1993.

===Separate projects (2000–present)===
John Richardson, under the name Jayadev, has recorded as a session percussionist, and played on Tight Fit&#x27;s version of The Lion Sleeps Tonight.

In 2000, Williams and Hurd both formed their own versions of the Rubettes, which at the time both also included two members of the Rubettes in each group (Clarke and Richardson in Williams&#x27;, Da Vinci and Bines in Hurd&#x27;s). Due to legal issues, both versions of the band have to specify that their version is only led by them, by having the phrase &quot;featuring __&quot; after &quot;The Rubettes&quot;.

In March 2012, Thorpe digitally released the &quot;No Hits, No Jazz Collection&quot; and performed at Darwen Library Theatre with a live eight-piece band for his &#x27;50th Anniversary 1-Gig-Tour&#x27;. It featured session musicians Iain Reddy, Liam Barber, Justin Randall and Greg Harper. &quot;You&#x27;re the Reason Why&quot; was played.

== Legal issues ==
In 2002, the group hit the headlines once more when, following an acrimonious split and legal action, the Rubettes became the latest in a long line of bands (including the Beach Boys and Spandau Ballet) to end up in the courts in a dispute over ownership of the band&#x27;s name. The court ruled that both Williams and Hurd could tour as the Rubettes, as long as it was clear which member was fronting the band.

All was well until 2005 when Williams and Hurd were back in court following an appearance by Hurd&#x27;s band on the German television station ZDF, with Williams claiming Hurd had breached the terms of the original agreement. On 2 February 2006, a High Court judge found that Hurd and Williams had both been guilty of breaching the 2002 agreement. Costs of the trial were, however, awarded to Williams in view of the severity of Hurd&#x27;s breaches. Hurd appealed against this decision, but on 3 November 2006, the Appeal Court in London ruled against him, awarding the costs of the appeal to Williams. Hurd has since gone bankrupt.

=== 2022 High Court ownership ruling ===
In July 2022 Alan Williams and his company won a High Court trial for the ownership of The Rubettes name, against Clarke, Richardson and Etherington. Sitting in the High Court in London, Judge Pat Treacy ruled for Williams and said: &quot;The defendants&#x27; conduct amounts to a misrepresentation sufficient to engage the tort of passing off. The claimants have succeeded.&quot;

== Different versions of the Rubettes ==

=== The Rubettes featuring Alan Williams (2000-present) ===
In 2000, Williams formed his version of the band along with Clarke, Richardson, and ex-Kinks keyboardist Mark Haley.

On 21 September 2014, as part of the Rubettes&#x27; 40th anniversary, it was announced that Alan Williams, John Richardson, and Mick Clarke would return to the Olympia in Paris, the same venue at which the Rubettes made their first appearance in France in 1974 when &quot;Sugar Baby Love&quot; topped the French and European charts.

The band broke up in February 2019. A new Rubettes was formed with the original members John Richardson, Mick Clarke, and Steve Etherington (producer/arranger since 1995).

Timeline

=== The Rubettes featuring Bill Hurd (2000-present) ===
Following the dissolution of the original band; Hurd formed his version of the group with longtime drummer Alex Bines, vocalist Paul Da Vinci (who had performed lead vocal on &quot;Sugar Baby Love&quot;), bassist Billy Hill, and guitarist Rufus Rufell. Da Vinci departed the band in 2006 and was replaced by George Bird, and guitarist Rufell leaving in 2009 and replaced by Ian Pearce.

In June 2009, Bill Hurd&#x27;s Rubettes played at the East Kilbride ArtBurst Festival.

In 2010, Bill Hurd&#x27;s Rubettes covered the 1997 Thorpe composition &quot;Where the Angels Fear to Tread&quot; on their album &quot;21st Century Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; on Angel Air Records.

2013 saw the beginning of the most turbulent period in the band&#x27;s history, as line-up instability was common for the next two years. First Bines, Hill, and Pearce all left the band to be replaced by Paul Callaby (drums), Ray Frost (guitars), and John Sorrell (bass) respectively; leaving Hurd as the last remaining &#x27;founding member&#x27; of his version of the group left in the band. Late 2013 saw Bird depart the band to be replaced by Yvan Silva. By mid-2013 the band underwent a major personnel upheaval again, as everyone other than Hurd departed the band.

The line-up then solidified with the arrival of vocalist Ken Butler, drummer Martin Clapson, and guitarist Dave Harding; with Mike Steed joining them on bass (on loan from The Marmalade) for a few months. The band line up has remained fairly settled since 2014 with the only changes following the death of Ken Butler in 2018 saw the appointment of John Summerton (ex Flintlock) on guitar and vocals, and the arrival of drummer Damian Fisher.

<doc id="53771" wikidata="Q33795" url="?curid=53771" title="Senufo languages">
<text>The Senufo or Senufic languages () comprise around 15 languages spoken by the Senufo in the north of Ivory Coast, the south of Mali and the southwest of Burkina Faso. An isolated language, Nafaanra, is also spoken in the west of Ghana. The Senufo languages constitute their own branch of the Atlantic–Congo sub-family of the Niger–Congo languages. Anne Garber estimates the total number of Senufos at some 1.5 million; the Ethnologue, based on various population estimates, counts 2.7 million.
The Senufo languages are bounded to the west by Mande languages, to the south by Kwa languages, and to the north and east by Central Gur languages.

The Senufo languages are like the Gur languages in that they have a suffixal noun class system and that verbs are marked for aspect. Most Gur languages to the north of Senufo have a two tone downstep system, but the tonal system of the Senufo languages is mostly analysed as a three level tone system (High, Mid, Low).

The Senufo languages have been influenced by the neighbouring Mande languages in numerous ways. Many words have been borrowed from the Mande languages Bambara and Jula. Carlson notes that &quot;it is probable that several grammatical constructions are calques on the corresponding Bambara constructions&quot;. Like Mande languages, the Senufo languages have a subject–object–verb (SOV) constituent order, rather than the subject–verb–object (SVO) order which is more common in Gur and in Niger–Congo as a whole.

==Classification==
Delafosse was the first linguist to write on the Senufo languages. He noted that the Senufo were often confused with the Mande, partly because use of Mande languages by the Senufo was widespread:
:&quot;[L]a langue mandé s&#x27;est répandue parmi eux, des alliances nombreuses ont eu lieu... C&#x27;est là l&#x27;origine de la confusion que l&#x27;on a faite souvent entre Mandé et Sénoufo ... alors que, au triple point de vue ethnographique, antropologique et linguistique, la différence est profonde entre ces deux familles.&quot;

In the influential classifications of Westermann and Bendor-Samuel, the Senufo languages were classified as Gur languages. In 1975, this classification was called into doubt by Gabriel Manessy. In 1989, John Naden, in his overview of the Gur family, stated that ‘[t]he remaining languages, especially Senufo, may well be no more closely related to Central Gur than to Guang or Togo Remnant, or than these to Central Gur or Volta-Comoe’.

==Subclassification==
Early Senufo classifications were mainly geographically motivated, dividing the Senufo languages into Northern, Central, and Southern Senufo. In subsequent years, this terminology was adopted by several linguists working on Senufo languages. Mensah (1983) and Mills (1984) avoided this geographical terms but used mainly the same grouping. SIL International in its Ethnologue subdivides the Senufo languages in six groups. Combining the two classifications results in the grouping below.

Northern Senufo
*Suppire–Mamara languages
**Mamara (Minyanka, Mianka) (740,000 speakers)
**Nanerigé (Nanergé) (50,000 speakers)
**Sucite (Sicite, Sìcìté) (38,000 speakers)
**Supyire (Suppire, Shempire, Syempire) (spoken in Mali) (460,000 speakers)
Central Senufo
*Karaboro languages
**Eastern Karaboro (Kar) (40,000 speakers)
**Western Karaboro (Syer-Tenyer) (30,000 speakers)
*Senari languages
**Cebaara (Tyebaala) (860,000 speakers)
**Senara (spoken in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire) (210,000 speakers)
**Nyarafolo (60,000 speakers)
*Kpalaga (Palaka) (spoken in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire) (8,000 speakers)
Southern Senufo
*Tagwana–Djimini languages
**Djimini (Dyimini) (spoken in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire) (96,000 speakers)
**Tagwana (Tagouna) (140,000 speakers)
*Nafaanra (Nafaara) (61,000 speakers)

<text>The Gur languages, also known as Central Gur or Mabia, belong to the Niger–Congo languages. They are spoken in the Sahelian and savanna regions of West Africa, namely: in most areas of Burkina Faso, and in south-central Mali, northeastern Ivory Coast, the northern halves of Ghana and Togo, northwestern Benin, and southwestern Niger. A few Gur languages are spoken in Nigeria. Additionally, a single Gur language, Baatonum, is spoken in Benin and in the extreme northwest of Nigeria. Three other single Gur languages, the Tusya, Vyemo and Tiefo languages, are spoken in Burkina Faso. Another unclassified Gur language, Miyobe, is spoken in Benin and Togo. In addition, Kulango, Loma and Lorhon, are spoken in Ghana, Ivory Coast and Burkina Faso. Additionally, a few Mossi speakers are in Senegal, and speakers of the Dagaare language are also found in Cameroon. The Samu languages of Burkina Faso are Gur languages.

==Typological features==
Like most Niger–Congo languages, the ancestor of Gur languages probably had a noun class system; many of today&#x27;s languages have reduced this to a system of nominal genders or declensions or no longer have a class system. A common property of Gur languages is the verbal aspect marking. Almost all Gur languages are tonal, with Koromfé being a notable exception. The tonal systems of Gur languages are rather divergent. Most Gur languages have been described as following the model of a two tone downstep system, but the languages of Oti-Volta branch and some others have three phonemic tones.

==History of study==
Sigismund Wilhelm Koelle first mentions twelve Gur languages in his 1854 &quot;Polyglotta Africana&quot;, which represent ten languages in modern classification. Notably, he correctly identified these languages as being related to one another; his &#x27;North-Eastern High Sudan&#x27; corresponds to Gur in modern classification.&lt;mapframe latitude=&quot;10.271681&quot; longitude=&quot;-1.351318&quot; zoom=&quot;7&quot; width=&quot;526&quot; height=&quot;460&quot; text=&quot;Map showing the Mabia Languages that are currently under study.&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;

The Gur family was previously called Voltaic, following the French name &quot;(langues) Voltaïques&quot; (named after the Volta River). It was once considered to be more extensive than it is often regarded today, including the Senufo languages and a number of small language isolates. The inclusion of Senufo within Gur has been rejected by many linguists, including Tony Naden. Williamson and Blench place Senufo as a separate branch of Atlantic–Congo, while other non-Central Gur languages are placed somewhat closer as separate branches within the Savannas continuum.

Kleinewillinghöfer (2014) notes that the closest relatives of Gur appear to be several branches of the obsolete Adamawa family, since many &quot;Adamawa&quot; languages in fact share more similarities with various (Central) Gur languages than with other Adamawa languages. He proposes that early Gur-Adamawa speakers had cultivated guinea corn and millet in a wooded savanna environment.
== Classification ==
The regions on the map denote regional distribution of the Central Gur languages. The tree-diagram below denotes the relations between these languages and their closest relatives:
* ? Greater Gur (or Gur–Adamawa)
** Central Gur (or Mabia)
*** Northern Gur
***** (1.) Oti–Volta (28 languages, including Mooré, Mamprusi, Dagbani, and Gurma)
***** (2.) Bwa (or Bwamu, Bomu, Bobo-Wule)
**** (3.) &quot;Koromfé&quot; (or Koromfe)
*** Southern Gur
***** (4.) East Mabia
****** Gurunsi (or Grũsi) (20 languages, including Kabiye)
***** (5.) Kirma–Lobi
****** Kirma–Tyurama (Cerma, Turka)
****** Lobi–Dyan (Lobi, Dyan)
**** (6.) Doghose–Gan (Dogosé, Kaansa, Khisa)
**** (7.) ? Dogoso–Khe (Dogoso, Khe)
** ? Waja–Kam
** ? Leko–Nimbari
** ? (possibly other putative Adamawa languages)
The position of Dogoso–Khe in Southern Gur is not clear; it is not closely related to other members of the branch.

=== Bodomo (2017) ===
Bodomo (2017) refers to the entire Central Gur group as &quot;Mabia&quot;. The term &quot;Mabia&quot; is a portmanteau of the two lexical innovations &quot;ma&quot;- &#x27;mother&#x27; + &quot;bia&quot; &#x27;child&#x27;.

The following is a classification of the Mabia (or Central Gur) languages from Bodomo (2017), as cited in Bodomo (2020). Bodomo divides Mabia into three primary branches, namely West, East, and Central.
* Mabia
** East (or Gurunsi, Grũsi)
*** Kasem
*** Sisaala
*** Kabiye
** West (or Gurma)
*** Bassari
*** Konkomba
*** Moba
** Central
*** Dagaare
**** Dagaare
**** Wali
**** Birifor
**** Safaliba
*** North
**** Moore
*** Mid-Central
**** Mabiene
**** Frafra (Nankanè)
**** Nabit
*** South
**** Dagbani
**** Mampruli
**** Nanuni (a dialect of Dagbani)
*** Kusaal
**** Kusaal (Kusasi)
**** Talni
*** Buli–Konni
**** Buli
**** Konni
*** Hanga–Kamara
**** Hanga
**** Kamara
The term &quot;Mabia&quot;, instead of &quot;Gur&quot;, is also used by Naden (2021).

Naden (2021) lists the languages of the Southern/Eastern Mabia group as Dagbani, Hanga, Kantoosi, Kamara, Kusaal (Kusasi), Mampruli (Mamprusi), Nabit, Nanun/Nanuni (also considered a dialect of Dagbani), and Talni.

<text>Kruskal&#x27;s algorithm finds a minimum spanning forest of an undirected edge-weighted graph. If the graph is connected, it finds a minimum spanning tree. It is a greedy algorithm that in each step adds to the forest the lowest-weight edge that will not form a cycle. The key steps of the algorithm are sorting and the use of a disjoint-set data structure to detect cycles. Its running time is dominated by the time to sort all of the graph edges by their weight.

A minimum spanning tree of a connected weighted graph is a connected subgraph, without cycles, for which the sum of the weights of all the edges in the subgraph is minimal. For a disconnected graph, a minimum spanning forest is composed of a minimum spanning tree for each connected component.

This algorithm was first published by Joseph Kruskal in 1956, and was rediscovered soon afterward by . Other algorithms for this problem include Prim&#x27;s algorithm, Borůvka&#x27;s algorithm, and the reverse-delete algorithm.

==Algorithm==
The algorithm performs the following steps:
* Create a forest (a set of trees) initially consisting of a separate single-vertex tree for each vertex in the input graph.
* Sort the graph edges by weight.
* Loop through the edges of the graph, in ascending sorted order by their weight. For each edge:
**Test whether adding the edge to the current forest would create a cycle.
**If not, add the edge to the forest, combining two trees into a single tree.

At the termination of the algorithm, the forest forms a minimum spanning forest of the graph. If the graph is connected, the forest has a single component and forms a minimum spanning tree.

==Pseudocode==
The following code is implemented with a disjoint-set data structure. It represents the forest &quot;F&quot; as a set of undirected edges, and uses the disjoint-set data structure to efficiently determine whether two vertices are part of the same tree.

 algorithm Kruskal(&quot;G&quot;) is
 F:= ∅
 for each v in G.V do
 MAKE-SET(v)
 for each {u, v} in G.E ordered by weight({u, v}), increasing do
 if FIND-SET(u) ≠ FIND-SET(v) then
 F := F ∪ { {u, v} }
 UNION(FIND-SET(u), FIND-SET(v))
 return F

== Complexity ==

For a graph with edges and vertices, Kruskal&#x27;s algorithm can be shown to run in time time, with simple data structures. This time bound is often written instead as , which is equivalent for graphs with no isolated vertices, because for these graphs and the logarithms of and are again within a constant factor of each other.

To achieve this bound, first sort the edges by weight using a comparison sort in time. Once sorted, it is possible to loop through the edges in sorted order in constant time per edge. Next, use a disjoint-set data structure, with a set of vertices for each component, to keep track of which vertices are in which components. Creating this structure, with a separate set for each vertex, takes operations and time. The final iteration through all edges performs two find operations and possibly one union operation per edge. These operations take amortized time time per operation, giving worst-case total time for this loop, where is the extremely slowly growing inverse Ackermann function. This part of the time bound is much smaller than the time for the sorting step, so the total time for the algorithm can be simplified to the time for the sorting step.

In cases where the edges are already sorted, or where they have small enough integer weight to allow integer sorting algorithms such as counting sort or radix sort to sort them in linear time, the disjoint set operations are the slowest remaining part of the algorithm and the total time is .

== Example ==

== Proof of correctness ==

The proof consists of two parts. First, it is proved that the algorithm produces a spanning tree. Second, it is proved that the constructed spanning tree is of minimal weight.

===Spanning tree===
Let formula_1 be a connected, weighted graph and let formula_2 be the subgraph of formula_1 produced by the algorithm. formula_2 cannot have a cycle, as by definition an edge is not added if it results in a cycle. formula_2 cannot be disconnected, since the first encountered edge that joins two components of formula_2 would have been added by the algorithm. Thus, formula_2 is a spanning tree of formula_1.

===Minimality===

We show that the following proposition P is true by induction: If &quot;F&quot; is the set of edges chosen at any stage of the algorithm, then there is some minimum spanning tree that contains &quot;F&quot; and none of the edges rejected by the algorithm.
* Clearly P is true at the beginning, when &quot;F&quot; is empty: any minimum spanning tree will do, and there exists one because a weighted connected graph always has a minimum spanning tree.
* Now assume P is true for some non-final edge set &quot;F&quot; and let &quot;T&quot; be a minimum spanning tree that contains &quot;F&quot;.
** If the next chosen edge &quot;e&quot; is also in &quot;T&quot;, then P is true for &quot;F&quot; + &quot;e&quot;.
**Otherwise, if &quot;e&quot; is not in &quot;T&quot; then &quot;T&quot; + &quot;e&quot; has a cycle &quot;C&quot;. The cycle &quot;C&quot; contains edges which do not belong to &quot;F&quot; + &quot;e&quot;, since &quot;e&quot; does not form a cycle when added to &quot;F&quot; but does in &quot;T&quot;. Let &quot;f&quot; be an edge which is in &quot;C&quot; but not in &quot;F&quot; + &quot;e&quot;. Note that &quot;f&quot; also belongs to &quot;T&quot;, since &quot;f&quot; belongs to &quot;T&quot; + &quot;e&quot; but not &quot;F&quot; + &quot;e&quot;. By P, &quot;f&quot; has not been considered by the algorithm. &quot;f&quot; must therefore have a weight at least as large as &quot;e&quot;. Then &quot;T&quot; − &quot;f&quot; + &quot;e&quot; is a tree, and it has the same or less weight as &quot;T&quot;. However since &quot;T&quot; is a minimum spanning tree then &quot;T&quot; − &quot;f&quot; + &quot;e&quot; has the same weight as &quot;T&quot;, otherwise we get a contradiction and &quot;T&quot; would not be a minimum spanning tree. So &quot;T&quot; − &quot;f&quot; + &quot;e&quot; is a minimum spanning tree containing &quot;F&quot; + &quot;e&quot; and again P holds.
* Therefore, by the principle of induction, P holds when &quot;F&quot; has become a spanning tree, which is only possible if &quot;F&quot; is a minimum spanning tree itself.

== Parallel algorithm ==

Kruskal&#x27;s algorithm is inherently sequential and hard to parallelize. It is, however, possible to perform the initial sorting of the edges in parallel or, alternatively, to use a parallel implementation of a binary heap to extract the minimum-weight edge in every iteration.
As parallel sorting is possible in time formula_9 on formula_10 processors, the runtime of Kruskal&#x27;s algorithm can be reduced to &quot;O&quot;(&quot;E&quot; α(&quot;V&quot;)), where α again is the inverse of the single-valued Ackermann function.

A variant of Kruskal&#x27;s algorithm, named Filter-Kruskal, has been described by Osipov et al. and is better suited for parallelization. The basic idea behind Filter-Kruskal is to partition the edges in a similar way to quicksort and filter out edges that connect vertices of the same tree to reduce the cost of sorting. The following pseudocode demonstrates this.
 function filter_kruskal(G) is
 if |G.E| &lt; kruskal_threshold:
 return kruskal(G)
 pivot = choose_random(G.E)
 E, E = partition(G.E, pivot)
 A = filter_kruskal(E)
 E = filter(E)
 A = A ∪ filter_kruskal(E)
 return A
 function partition(E, pivot) is
 E = ∅, E = ∅
 foreach (u, v) in E do
 if weight(u, v) ≤ pivot then
 E = E ∪ {(u, v)}
 else
 E = E ∪ {(u, v)}
 return E, E
 function filter(E) is
 E = ∅
 foreach (u, v) in E do
 if find_set(u) ≠ find_set(v) then
 E = E ∪ {(u, v)}
 return E

Filter-Kruskal lends itself better to parallelization as sorting, filtering, and partitioning can easily be performed in parallel by distributing the edges between the processors.

Finally, other variants of a parallel implementation of Kruskal&#x27;s algorithm have been explored. Examples include a scheme that uses helper threads to remove edges that are definitely not part of the MST in the background, and a variant which runs the sequential algorithm on &quot;p&quot; subgraphs, then merges those subgraphs until only one, the final MST, remains.

<text>The Ford–Fulkerson method or Ford–Fulkerson algorithm (FFA) is a greedy algorithm that computes the maximum flow in a flow network. It is sometimes called a &quot;method&quot; instead of an &quot;algorithm&quot; as the approach to finding augmenting paths in a residual graph is not fully specified or it is specified in several implementations with different running times. It was published in 1956 by L. R. Ford Jr. and D. R. Fulkerson. The name &quot;Ford–Fulkerson&quot; is often also used for the Edmonds–Karp algorithm, which is a fully defined implementation of the Ford–Fulkerson method.

The idea behind the algorithm is as follows: as long as there is a path from the source (start node) to the sink (end node), with available capacity on all edges in the path, we send flow along one of the paths. Then we find another path, and so on. A path with available capacity is called an augmenting path.

==Algorithm==
Let formula_1 be a graph, and for each edge from to , let formula_2 be the capacity and formula_3 be the flow. We want to find the maximum flow from the source to the sink . After every step in the algorithm the following is maintained:

This means that the flow through the network is a &quot;legal flow&quot; after each round in the algorithm. We define the residual network formula_4 to be the network with capacity formula_5 and no flow. Notice that it can happen that a flow from to is allowed in the residual
network, though disallowed in the original network: if formula_6 and formula_7 then formula_8.
:Inputs Given a Network formula_9 with flow capacity , a source node , and a sink node

The path in step 2 can be found with, for example, breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search in formula_4. The former is known as the Edmonds–Karp algorithm.

When no more paths in step 2 can be found, will not be able to reach in the residual
network. If is the set of nodes reachable by in the residual network, then the total
capacity in the original network of edges from to the remainder of is on the one hand
equal to the total flow we found from to ,
and on the other hand serves as an upper bound for all such flows.
This proves that the flow we found is maximal. See also Max-flow Min-cut theorem.

If the graph formula_1 has multiple sources and sinks, we act as follows:
Suppose that formula_21 and formula_22. Add a new source formula_23 with an edge formula_24 from formula_25 to every node formula_26, with capacity formula_27. And add a new sink formula_28 with an edge formula_29 from every node formula_30 to formula_31, with capacity formula_32. Then apply the Ford–Fulkerson algorithm.
Also, if a node has capacity constraint formula_33, we replace this node with two nodes formula_34, and an edge formula_35, with capacity formula_36. Then apply the Ford–Fulkerson algorithm.

==Complexity==
By adding the flow augmenting path to the flow already established in the graph, the maximum flow will be reached when no more flow augmenting paths can be found in the graph. However, there is no certainty that this situation will ever be reached, so the best that can be guaranteed is that the answer will be correct if the algorithm terminates. In the case that the algorithm runs forever, the flow might not even converge towards the maximum flow. However, this situation only occurs with irrational flow values. When the capacities are integers, the runtime of Ford–Fulkerson is bounded by formula_37 (see big O notation), where formula_38 is the number of edges in the graph and formula_39 is the maximum flow in the graph. This is because each augmenting path can be found in formula_40 time and increases the flow by an integer amount of at least formula_41, with the upper bound formula_39.

A variation of the Ford–Fulkerson algorithm with guaranteed termination and a runtime independent of the maximum flow value is the Edmonds–Karp algorithm, which runs in formula_43 time.

==Integer flow example==

The following example shows the first steps of Ford–Fulkerson in a flow network with 4 nodes, source formula_44 and sink formula_45. This example shows the worst-case behaviour of the algorithm. In each step, only a flow of formula_41 is sent across the network. If breadth-first-search were used instead, only two steps would be needed.

==Non-terminating example==

Consider the flow network shown on the right, with source formula_47, sink formula_48, capacities of edges formula_49, formula_50 and formula_51, and the capacity of all other edges some integer formula_52. The constant formula_53 was chosen so, that formula_54. We use augmenting paths according to the following table, where formula_55, formula_56 and formula_57.

Note that after step 1 as well as after step 5, the residual capacities of edges formula_58, formula_59 and formula_60 are in the form formula_61, formula_62 and formula_63, respectively, for some formula_64. This means that we can use augmenting paths formula_65, formula_66, formula_65 and formula_68 infinitely many times and residual capacities of these edges will always be in the same form. Total flow in the network after step 5 is formula_69. If we continue to use augmenting paths as above, the total flow converges to formula_70. However, note that there is a flow of value formula_71, by sending formula_72 units of flow along formula_73, 1 unit of flow along formula_74, and formula_72 units of flow along formula_76. Therefore, the algorithm never terminates and the flow does not even converge to the maximum flow.

Another non-terminating example based on the Euclidean algorithm is given by , where they also show that the worst case running-time of the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm on a network formula_1 in ordinal numbers is formula_78.

<doc id="53781" wikidata="Q4027242" url="?curid=53781" title="Relative permittivity">
<text>The relative permittivity (in older texts, dielectric constant) is the permittivity of a material expressed as a ratio with the electric permittivity of a vacuum. A dielectric is an insulating material, and the dielectric constant of an insulator measures the ability of the insulator to store electric energy in an electrical field.

Permittivity is a material&#x27;s property that affects the Coulomb force between two point charges in the material. Relative permittivity is the factor by which the electric field between the charges is decreased relative to vacuum.

Likewise, relative permittivity is the ratio of the capacitance of a capacitor using that material as a dielectric, compared with a similar capacitor that has vacuum as its dielectric. Relative permittivity is also commonly known as the dielectric constant, a term still used but deprecated by standards organizations in engineering as well as in chemistry.

== Definition ==
Relative permittivity is typically denoted as (sometimes , lowercase kappa) and is defined as
: formula_1
where &quot;ε&quot;(&quot;ω&quot;) is the complex frequency-dependent permittivity of the material, and &quot;ε&quot;0 is the vacuum permittivity.

Relative permittivity is a dimensionless number that is in general complex-valued; its real and imaginary parts are denoted as:
:formula_2

The relative permittivity of a medium is related to its electric susceptibility, , as .

In anisotropic media (such as non cubic crystals) the relative permittivity is a second rank tensor.

The relative permittivity of a material for a frequency of zero is known as its static relative permittivity.

=== Terminology ===
The historical term for the relative permittivity is &quot;dielectric constant&quot;. It is still commonly used, but has been deprecated by standards organizations, because of its ambiguity, as some older reports used it for the absolute permittivity &quot;ε&quot;. The permittivity may be quoted either as a static property or as a frequency-dependent variant, in which case it is also known as the &quot;dielectric function&quot;. It has also been used to refer to only the real component &quot;ε&quot;′r of the complex-valued relative permittivity.

=== Physics ===
In the causal theory of waves, permittivity is a complex quantity. The imaginary part corresponds to a phase shift of the polarization relative to and leads to the attenuation of electromagnetic waves passing through the medium. By definition, the linear relative permittivity of vacuum is equal to 1, that is , although there are theoretical nonlinear quantum effects in vacuum that become non-negligible at high field strengths.

The following table gives some typical values.
The relative low frequency permittivity of ice is ~96 at −10.8 °C, falling to 3.15 at high frequency, which is independent of temperature. It remains in the range 3.12–3.19 for frequencies between about 1 MHz and the far infrared region.

== Measurement ==
The relative static permittivity, &quot;ε&quot;r, can be measured for static electric fields as follows: first the capacitance of a test capacitor, &quot;C&quot;0, is measured with vacuum between its plates. Then, using the same capacitor and distance between its plates, the capacitance &quot;C&quot; with a dielectric between the plates is measured. The relative permittivity can be then calculated as
: formula_3

For time-variant electromagnetic fields, this quantity becomes frequency-dependent. An indirect technique to calculate &quot;ε&quot;r is conversion of radio frequency S-parameter measurement results. A description of frequently used S-parameter conversions for determination of the frequency-dependent &quot;ε&quot;r of dielectrics can be found in this bibliographic source. Alternatively, resonance based effects may be employed at fixed frequencies.

==Applications==

=== Energy ===
The relative permittivity is an essential piece of information when designing capacitors, and in other circumstances where a material might be expected to introduce capacitance into a circuit. If a material with a high relative permittivity is placed in an electric field, the magnitude of that field will be measurably reduced within the volume of the dielectric. This fact is commonly used to increase the capacitance of a particular capacitor design. The layers beneath etched conductors in printed circuit boards (PCBs) also act as dielectrics.

=== Communication ===
Dielectrics are used in radio frequency (RF) transmission lines. In a coaxial cable, polyethylene can be used between the center conductor and outside shield. It can also be placed inside waveguides to form filters. Optical fibers are examples of &quot;dielectric waveguides&quot;. They consist of dielectric materials that are purposely doped with impurities so as to control the precise value of &quot;ε&quot;r within the cross-section. This controls the refractive index of the material and therefore also the optical modes of transmission. However, in these cases it is technically the relative permittivity that matters, as they are not operated in the electrostatic limit.

=== Environment ===
The relative permittivity of air changes with temperature, humidity, and barometric pressure. Sensors can be constructed to detect changes in capacitance caused by changes in the relative permittivity. Most of this change is due to effects of temperature and humidity as the barometric pressure is fairly stable. Using the capacitance change, along with the measured temperature, the relative humidity can be obtained using engineering formulas.

=== Chemistry ===
The relative static permittivity of a solvent is a relative measure of its chemical polarity. For example, water is very polar, and has a relative static permittivity of 80.10 at 20 °C while &quot;n&quot;-hexane is non-polar, and has a relative static permittivity of 1.89 at 20 °C. This information is important when designing separation, sample preparation and chromatography techniques in analytical chemistry.

The correlation should, however, be treated with caution. For instance, dichloromethane has a value of &quot;ε&quot;r of 9.08 (20 °C) and is rather poorly soluble in water (13g/L or 9.8mL/L at 20 °C); at the same time, tetrahydrofuran has its &quot;ε&quot;r = 7.52 at 22 °C, but it is completely miscible with water. In the case of tetrahydrofuran, the oxygen atom can act as a hydrogen bond acceptor; whereas dichloromethane cannot form hydrogen bonds with water.

This is even more remarkable when comparing the &quot;ε&quot;r values of acetic acid (6.2528) and that of iodoethane (7.6177). The large numerical value of &quot;ε&quot;r is not surprising in the second case, as the iodine atom is easily polarizable; nevertheless, this does not imply that it is polar, too (electronic polarizability prevails over the orientational one in this case).

== Lossy medium ==
Again, similar as for absolute permittivity, relative permittivity for lossy materials can be formulated as:
: formula_4
in terms of a &quot;dielectric conductivity&quot; &quot;σ&quot; (units S/m, siemens per meter), which &quot;sums over all the dissipative effects of the material; it may represent an actual [electrical] conductivity caused by migrating charge carriers and it may also refer to an energy loss associated with the dispersion of &quot;ε&quot;′ [the real-valued permittivity]&quot; ( p. 8). Expanding the angular frequency and the electric constant , which reduces to:
: formula_5
where &quot;λ&quot; is the wavelength, &quot;c&quot; is the speed of light in vacuum and = 59.95849 Ω ≈ 60.0 Ω is a newly introduced constant (units ohms, or reciprocal siemens, such that &quot;σλκ&quot; = &quot;ε&quot;r remains unitless).

== Metals ==
Permittivity is typically associated with dielectric materials, however metals are described as having an effective permittivity, with real relative permittivity equal to one. In the high-frequency region, which extends from radio frequencies to the far infrared and terahertz region, the plasma frequency of the electron gas is much greater than the electromagnetic propagation frequency, so the refractive index &quot;n&quot; of a metal is very nearly a purely imaginary number. In the low frequency regime, the effective relative permittivity is also almost purely imaginary: It has a very large imaginary value related to the conductivity and a comparatively insignificant real-value.

Other names for it include mackinaw, namaycush, lake char(or charr), touladi, togue, laker, and grey trout. In Lake Superior, it can also be variously known as siscowet, paperbelly and lean. The lake trout is prized both as a game fish and as a food fish. Those caught with dark coloration may be called &quot;mud hens&quot;.

== Taxonomy ==
It is the only member of the subgenus Cristovomer, which is more derived than the subgenus &quot;Baione&quot; (the most basal clade of &quot;Salvelinus&quot;, containing the brook trout (&quot;S. fontinalis&quot;) and silver trout (&quot;S. agasizii&quot;)) but still basal to the other members of &quot;Salvelinus&quot;.

==Range==
From a zoogeographical perspective, lake trout have a relatively narrow distribution. They are native only to the northern parts of North America, principally Canada, but also Alaska and, to some extent, the northeastern United States. Lake trout have been widely introduced into non-native waters in North America and into many other parts of the world, mainly Europe, but also into South America and certain parts of Asia. Although lake trout were introduced into Yellowstone National Park&#x27;s Shoshone, Lewis and Heart lakes legally in the 1890s, they were illegally or accidentally introduced into Yellowstone Lake in the 1980s where they are now considered invasive.

==Description==

Lake trout are the largest of the chars; the record weighed almost (netted) with a length of , and fish are not uncommon. The average length is . The largest caught on a rod and reel according to the IGFA was , caught in Great Bear Lake in 1995 with a length of .

==Life history==
Lake trout inhabit cold, oxygen-rich waters. They are pelagic during the period of summer stratification in dimictic lakes, often living at depths of .

The lake trout is a slow-growing fish, typical of oligotrophic waters. It is also very late to mature. Populations are extremely susceptible to overfishing. Many native lake trout populations have been severely damaged through the combined effects of hatchery stocking (planting) and over harvest. Another threat to lake trout is acidification, which can have longterm effects on their populations through both direct harm and reduced prey populations (e.g. &quot;Mysis relicta&quot;).

There are three subspecies of lake trout. There is the common lake trout (&quot;Salvelinus namaycush namaycush&quot;), the siscowet lake trout (&quot;Salvelinus namaycush siscowet&quot;), and the less common rush lake trout (&quot;Salvelinus namaycush huronicus&quot;). Some lakes do not have pelagic forage fish during the period of summer stratification. In these lakes, lake trout act as planktivores. Lake trout in planktivorous populations are highly abundant, grow very slowly and mature at relatively small sizes. In those lakes that do contain deep-water forage, lake trout become piscivorous. Piscivorous lake trout grow much more quickly, mature at a larger size and are less abundant. Notwithstanding differences in abundance, the density of biomass of lake trout is fairly consistent in similar lakes, regardless of whether the lake trout populations they contain are planktivorous or piscivorous.

In Lake Superior, common lake trout (&quot;S. n. namaycush&quot;) and siscowet lake trout (&quot;S. n. siscowet&quot;) live together. Common lake trout tend to stay in shallower waters, while siscowet lake trout stay in deeper water. Common lake trout (also called &quot;lean&quot; lake trout) are slimmer than the relatively fat siscowet. Siscowet numbers have become greatly depressed over the years due to a combination of the extirpation of some of the fish&#x27;s deep water coregonine prey and to overexploitation. Siscowet tend to grow extremely large and fat and attracted great commercial interest in the last century. Their populations have rebounded since 1970, with one estimate putting the number in Lake Superior at 100 million. Professor of Zoology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison James Kitchell credits effective constraint of commercial fisheries and persistent sea lamprey (&quot;Petromyzon marinus&quot;) control for the successful recovery of Lake Superior&#x27;s lake trout. &quot;Looking at what has happened in the lake and the results of computer simulations, it is clear that lamprey control needs to continue if Lake Superior is to keep its lake trout.&quot;

==Hybrids==
Lake trout are known to hybridize in nature with the brook trout; such hybrids, known as &quot;splake&quot;, are normally sterile but self-sustaining populations exist in some lakes. Splake are also artificially propagated in hatcheries, and then stocked into lakes in an effort to provide sport-fishing opportunities.

==Commercial fishing==

Lake trout were fished commercially in the Great Lakes until lampreys, overharvest and pollution extirpated or severely reduced the stocks. Commercial fisheries still exist in some areas of the Great Lakes and smaller lakes in northern Canada. Commercial fishing by Ottawa (Odawa) and Chippewa (Ojibwe) Indians for Lake Trout in Lake Michigan, Lake Huron and Lake Superior is permitted under various treaties and co-managed and regulated by many tribes and Great Lakes Indian Fish &amp; Wildlife Commission (GLIFWC).

==Origin of name==
The specific epithet &quot;namaycush&quot; derives from &quot;namekush&quot;, a form of the word used in some inland Southern East Cree communities in referring to this species of fish. Other variations found in East Cree are &quot;kûkamâs[h]&quot;, &quot;kûkamâw&quot; and &quot;kûkamesh&quot;. Similar cognate words are found in Ojibwe: &quot;namegos&quot; = &quot;lake trout&quot;; &quot;namegoshens&quot; = &quot;rainbow trout&quot;, literally meaning &quot;little lake trout&quot;.

==Popular culture==
Geneva, New York claims the title &quot;Lake Trout Capital of the World,&quot; and holds an annual lake trout fishing derby.

<text>In computer science, Prim&#x27;s algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph. This means it finds a subset of the edges that forms a tree that includes every vertex, where the total weight of all the edges in the tree is minimized. The algorithm operates by building this tree one vertex at a time, from an arbitrary starting vertex, at each step adding the cheapest possible connection from the tree to another vertex.

The algorithm was developed in 1930 by Czech mathematician Vojtěch Jarník and later rediscovered and republished by computer scientists Robert C. Prim in 1957 and Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1959. Therefore, it is also sometimes called the Jarník&#x27;s algorithm, Prim–Jarník algorithm, Prim–Dijkstra algorithm
or the DJP algorithm.

Other well-known algorithms for this problem include Kruskal&#x27;s algorithm and Borůvka&#x27;s algorithm. These algorithms find the minimum spanning forest in a possibly disconnected graph; in contrast, the most basic form of Prim&#x27;s algorithm only finds minimum spanning trees in connected graphs. However, running Prim&#x27;s algorithm separately for each connected component of the graph, it can also be used to find the minimum spanning forest. In terms of their asymptotic time complexity, these three algorithms are equally fast for sparse graphs, but slower than other more sophisticated algorithms.
However, for graphs that are sufficiently dense, Prim&#x27;s algorithm can be made to run in linear time, meeting or improving the time bounds for other algorithms.

== Description ==
The algorithm may informally be described as performing the following steps:
In more detail, it may be implemented following the pseudocode below.
As described above, the starting vertex for the algorithm will be chosen arbitrarily, because the first iteration of the main loop of the algorithm will have a set of vertices in &quot;Q&quot; that all have equal weights, and the algorithm will automatically start a new tree in &quot;F&quot; when it completes a spanning tree of each connected component of the input graph. The algorithm may be modified to start with any particular vertex &quot;s&quot; by setting &quot;C&quot;[&quot;s&quot;] to be a number smaller than the other values of &quot;C&quot; (for instance, zero), and it may be modified to only find a single spanning tree rather than an entire spanning forest (matching more closely the informal description) by stopping whenever it encounters another vertex flagged as having no associated edge.

Different variations of the algorithm differ from each other in how the set &quot;Q&quot; is implemented: as a simple linked list or array of vertices, or as a more complicated priority queue data structure. This choice leads to differences in the time complexity of the algorithm. In general, a priority queue will be quicker at finding the vertex &quot;v&quot; with minimum cost, but will entail more expensive updates when the value of &quot;C&quot;[&quot;w&quot;] changes.

== Time complexity ==
The time complexity of Prim&#x27;s algorithm depends on the data structures used for the graph and for ordering the edges by weight, which can be done using a priority queue. The following table shows the typical choices:

A simple implementation of Prim&#x27;s, using an adjacency matrix or an adjacency list graph representation and linearly searching an array of weights to find the minimum weight edge to add, requires O(|V|2) running time. However, this running time can be greatly improved by using heaps to implement finding minimum weight edges in the algorithm&#x27;s inner loop.

A first improved version uses a heap to store all edges of the input graph, ordered by their weight. This leads to an O(|E| log |E|) worst-case running time. But storing vertices instead of edges can improve it still further. The heap should order the vertices by the smallest edge-weight that connects them to any vertex in the partially constructed minimum spanning tree (MST) (or infinity if no such edge exists). Every time a vertex &quot;v&quot; is chosen and added to the MST, a decrease-key operation is performed on all vertices &quot;w&quot; outside the partial MST such that &quot;v&quot; is connected to &quot;w&quot;, setting the key to the minimum of its previous value and the edge cost of (&quot;v&quot;,&quot;w&quot;).

Using a simple binary heap data structure, Prim&#x27;s algorithm can now be shown to run in time O(|E| log |V|) where |E| is the number of edges and |V| is the number of vertices. Using a more sophisticated Fibonacci heap, this can be brought down to O(|E| + |V| log |V|), which is asymptotically faster when the graph is dense enough that |E| is ω(|V|), and linear time when |E| is at least |V| log |V|. For graphs of even greater density (having at least |V|&quot;c&quot; edges for some &quot;c&quot; &gt; 1), Prim&#x27;s algorithm can be made to run in linear time even more simply, by using a &quot;d&quot;-ary heap in place of a Fibonacci heap.

== Proof of correctness ==
Let &quot;P&quot; be a connected, weighted graph. At every iteration of Prim&#x27;s algorithm, an edge must be found that connects a vertex in a subgraph to a vertex outside the subgraph. Since &quot;P&quot; is connected, there will always be a path to every vertex. The output &quot;Y&quot; of Prim&#x27;s algorithm is a tree, because the edge and vertex added to tree &quot;Y&quot; are connected. Let &quot;Y1&quot; be a minimum spanning tree of graph P. If &quot;Y1&quot;=&quot;Y&quot; then &quot;Y&quot; is a minimum spanning tree. Otherwise, let &quot;e&quot; be the first edge added during the construction of tree &quot;Y&quot; that is not in tree &quot;Y1&quot;, and &quot;V&quot; be the set of vertices connected by the edges added before edge &quot;e&quot;. Then one endpoint of edge &quot;e&quot; is in set &quot;V&quot; and the other is not. Since tree &quot;Y1&quot; is a spanning tree of graph &quot;P&quot;, there is a path in tree &quot;Y1&quot; joining the two endpoints. As one travels along the path, one must encounter an edge &quot;f&quot; joining a vertex in set &quot;V&quot; to one that is not in set &quot;V&quot;. Now, at the iteration when edge &quot;e&quot; was added to tree &quot;Y&quot;, edge &quot;f&quot; could also have been added and it would be added instead of edge &quot;e&quot; if its weight was less than &quot;e&quot;, and since edge &quot;f&quot; was not added, we conclude that

:formula_1

Let tree &quot;Y2&quot; be the graph obtained by removing edge &quot;f&quot; from and adding edge &quot;e&quot; to tree &quot;Y1&quot;. It is easy to show that tree &quot;Y2&quot; is connected, has the same number of edges as tree &quot;Y1&quot;, and the total weights of its edges is not larger than that of tree &quot;Y1&quot;, therefore it is also a minimum spanning tree of graph &quot;P&quot; and it contains edge &quot;e&quot; and all the edges added before it during the construction of set &quot;V&quot;. Repeat the steps above and we will eventually obtain a minimum spanning tree of graph &quot;P&quot; that is identical to tree &quot;Y&quot;. This shows &quot;Y&quot; is a minimum spanning tree. The minimum spanning tree allows for the first subset of the sub-region to be expanded into a larger subset &quot;X&quot;, which we assume to be the minimum.

== Parallel algorithm ==
The main loop of Prim&#x27;s algorithm is inherently sequential and thus not parallelizable. However, the inner loop, which determines the next edge of minimum weight that does not form a cycle, can be parallelized by dividing the vertices and edges between the available processors. The following pseudocode demonstrates this.

This algorithm can generally be implemented on distributed machines as well as on shared memory machines. The running time is formula_2, assuming that the &quot;reduce&quot; and &quot;broadcast&quot; operations can be performed in formula_3. A variant of Prim&#x27;s algorithm for shared memory machines, in which Prim&#x27;s sequential algorithm is being run in parallel, starting from different vertices, has also been explored. It should, however, be noted that more sophisticated algorithms exist to solve the distributed minimum spanning tree problem in a more efficient manner.

<text>In cryptography, a brute-force attack consists of an attacker submitting many passwords or passphrases with the hope of eventually guessing correctly. The attacker systematically checks all possible passwords and passphrases until the correct one is found. Alternatively, the attacker can attempt to guess the key which is typically created from the password using a key derivation function. This is known as an exhaustive key search. This approach doesn&#x27;t depend on intellectual tactics; rather, it relies on making several attempts.

A brute-force attack is a cryptanalytic attack that can, in theory, be used to attempt to decrypt any encrypted data (except for data encrypted in an information-theoretically secure manner). Such an attack might be used when it is not possible to take advantage of other weaknesses in an encryption system (if any exist) that would make the task easier.

When password-guessing, this method is very fast when used to check all short passwords, but for longer passwords other methods such as the dictionary attack are used because a brute-force search takes too long. Longer passwords, passphrases and keys have more possible values, making them exponentially more difficult to crack than shorter ones due to diversity of characters.

Brute-force attacks can be made less effective by obfuscating the data to be encoded making it more difficult for an attacker to recognize when the code has been cracked or by making the attacker do more work to test each guess. One of the measures of the strength of an encryption system is how long it would theoretically take an attacker to mount a successful brute-force attack against it.

Brute-force attacks are an application of brute-force search, the general problem-solving technique of enumerating all candidates and checking each one. The word &#x27;hammering&#x27; is sometimes used to describe a brute-force attack, with &#x27;anti-hammering&#x27; for countermeasures.

==Basic concept==

Brute-force attacks work by calculating every possible combination that could make up a password and testing it to see if it is the correct password. As the password&#x27;s length increases, the amount of time, on average, to find the correct password increases exponentially.

==Theoretical limits==
The resources required for a brute-force attack grow exponentially with increasing key size, not linearly. Although U.S. export regulations historically restricted key lengths to 56-bit symmetric keys (e.g. Data Encryption Standard), these restrictions are no longer in place, so modern symmetric algorithms typically use computationally stronger 128- to 256-bit keys.

There is a physical argument that a 128-bit symmetric key is computationally secure against brute-force attack. The Landauer limit implied by the laws of physics sets a lower limit on the energy required to perform a computation of per bit erased in a computation, where &quot;T&quot; is the temperature of the computing device in kelvins, &quot;k&quot; is the Boltzmann constant, and the natural logarithm of 2 is about 0.693 (0.6931471805599453). No irreversible computing device can use less energy than this, even in principle. Thus, in order to simply flip through the possible values for a 128-bit symmetric key (ignoring doing the actual computing to check it) would, theoretically, require &quot;2128 − 1&quot; bit flips on a conventional processor. If it is assumed that the calculation occurs near room temperature (≈300 K), the Von Neumann-Landauer Limit can be applied to estimate the energy required as ≈1018 joules, which is equivalent to consuming 30 gigawatts of power for one year. This is equal to 30×109 W×365×24×3600 s = 9.46×1017 J or 262.7 TWh (about 0.1% of the yearly world energy production). The full actual computation – checking each key to see if a solution has been found – would consume many times this amount. Furthermore, this is simply the energy requirement for cycling through the key space; the actual time it takes to flip each bit is not considered, which is certainly greater than 0 (see Bremermann&#x27;s limit).

However, this argument assumes that the register values are changed using conventional set and clear operations, which inevitably generate entropy. It has been shown that computational hardware can be designed not to encounter this theoretical obstruction (see reversible computing), though no such computers are known to have been constructed.
As commercial successors of governmental ASIC solutions have become available, also known as custom hardware attacks, two emerging technologies have proven their capability in the brute-force attack of certain ciphers. One is modern graphics processing unit (GPU) technology, the other is the field-programmable gate array (FPGA) technology. GPUs benefit from their wide availability and price-performance benefit, FPGAs from their energy efficiency per cryptographic operation. Both technologies try to transport the benefits of parallel processing to brute-force attacks. In case of GPUs some hundreds, in the case of FPGA some thousand processing units making them much better suited to cracking passwords than conventional processors. For instance in 2022, 8 Nvidia RTX 4090 GPU were linked together to test password strength by using the software Hashcat with results that showed 200 billion eight-character NTLM password combinations could be cycled through in 48 minutes.

Various publications in the fields of cryptographic analysis have proved the energy efficiency of today&#x27;s FPGA technology, for example, the COPACOBANA FPGA Cluster computer consumes the same energy as a single PC (600 W), but performs like 2,500 PCs for certain algorithms. A number of firms provide hardware-based FPGA cryptographic analysis solutions from a single FPGA PCI Express card up to dedicated FPGA computers. WPA and WPA2 encryption have successfully been brute-force attacked by reducing the workload by a factor of 50 in comparison to conventional CPUs and some hundred in case of FPGAs.
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) permits the use of 256-bit keys. Breaking a symmetric 256-bit key by brute-force requires 2128 times more computational power than a 128-bit key. One of the fastest supercomputers in 2019 has a speed of 100 petaFLOPS which could theoretically check 100 trillion (1014) AES keys per second (assuming 1000 operations per check), but would still require 3.67×1055 years to exhaust the 256-bit key space. 

An underlying assumption of a brute-force attack is that the complete key space was used to generate keys, something that relies on an effective random number generator, and that there are no defects in the algorithm or its implementation. For example, a number of systems that were originally thought to be impossible to crack by brute-force have nevertheless been cracked because the key space to search through was found to be much smaller than originally thought, because of a lack of entropy in their pseudorandom number generators. These include Netscape&#x27;s implementation of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) (cracked by Ian Goldberg and David Wagner in 1995) and a Debian/Ubuntu edition of OpenSSL discovered in 2008 to be flawed. A similar lack of implemented entropy led to the breaking of Enigma&#x27;s code.

==Credential recycling==
Credential recycling is the hacking practice of re-using username and password combinations gathered in previous brute-force attacks. A special form of credential recycling is pass the hash, where unsalted hashed credentials are stolen and re-used without first being brute-forced.

==Unbreakable codes==
Certain types of encryption, by their mathematical properties, cannot be defeated by brute-force. An example of this is one-time pad cryptography, where every cleartext bit has a corresponding key from a truly random sequence of key bits. A 140 character one-time-pad-encoded string subjected to a brute-force attack would eventually reveal every 140 character string possible, including the correct answer – but of all the answers given, there would be no way of knowing which was the correct one. Defeating such a system, as was done by the Venona project, generally relies not on pure cryptography, but upon mistakes in its implementation, such as the key pads not being truly random, intercepted keypads, or operators making mistakes.

==Countermeasures==
In case of an &quot;offline&quot; attack where the attacker has gained access to the encrypted material, one can try key combinations without the risk of discovery or interference. In case of &quot;online&quot; attacks, database and directory administrators can deploy countermeasures such as limiting the number of attempts that a password can be tried, introducing time delays between successive attempts, increasing the answer&#x27;s complexity (e.g., requiring a CAPTCHA answer or employing multi-factor authentication), and/or locking accounts out after unsuccessful login attempts. Website administrators may prevent a particular IP address from trying more than a predetermined number of password attempts against any account on the site. Additionally, the MITRE D3FEND framework provides structured recommendations for defending against brute-force attacks by implementing strategies such as network traffic filtering, deploying decoy credentials, and invalidating authentication caches.

==Reverse brute-force attack==
In a reverse brute-force attack (also called password spraying), a single (usually common) password is tested against multiple usernames or encrypted files. The process may be repeated for a select few passwords. In such a strategy, the attacker is not targeting a specific user.

<text>In cryptanalysis and computer security, a dictionary attack is an attack using a restricted subset of a keyspace to defeat a cipher or authentication mechanism by trying to determine its decryption key or passphrase, sometimes trying thousands or millions of likely possibilities often obtained from lists of past security breaches.

==Technique==
A dictionary attack is based on trying all the strings in a pre-arranged listing. Such attacks originally used words found in a dictionary (hence the phrase &quot;dictionary attack&quot;); however, now there are much larger lists available on the open Internet containing hundreds of millions of passwords recovered from past data breaches. There is also cracking software that can use such lists and produce common variations, such as substituting numbers for similar-looking letters. A dictionary attack tries only those possibilities which are deemed most likely to succeed. Dictionary attacks often succeed because many people have a tendency to choose short passwords that are ordinary words or common passwords; or variants obtained, for example, by appending a digit or punctuation character. Dictionary attacks are often successful, since many commonly used password creation techniques are covered by the available lists, combined with cracking software pattern generation. A safer approach is to randomly generate a long password (15 letters or more) or a multiword passphrase, using a password manager program or manually typing a password.

Dictionary attacks can be deterred by the server administrator by using a more computationally expensive hashing algorithm. Bcrypt, scrypt, and Argon2 are examples of such resource intensive functions that require significant computational power to process, allowing for large improvements in security against dictionary attacks. While other hashing functions, such as SHA and MD5, are much faster and less expensive to compute, they can still be strengthened by being applied multiple times to an input string through a process called key stretching. An attacker would have to know approximately how many times the function was applied for a dictionary attack to be feasible.

==Pre-computed dictionary attack/Rainbow table attack==
It is possible to achieve a time–space tradeoff by pre-computing a list of hashes of dictionary words and storing these in a database using the hash as the key. This requires a considerable amount of preparation time, but this allows the actual attack to be executed faster. The storage requirements for the pre-computed tables were once a major cost, but now they are less of an issue because of the low cost of disk storage. Pre-computed dictionary attacks are particularly effective when a large number of passwords are to be cracked. The pre-computed dictionary needs be generated only once, and when it is completed, password hashes can be looked up almost instantly at any time to find the corresponding password. A more refined approach involves the use of rainbow tables, which reduce storage requirements at the cost of slightly longer lookup-times. &quot;See&quot; LM hash for an example of an authentication system compromised by such an attack.

Pre-computed dictionary attacks, or &quot;rainbow table attacks&quot;, can be thwarted by the use of salt, a technique that forces the hash dictionary to be recomputed for each password sought, making precomputation infeasible, provided that the number of possible salt values is large enough.

<text>Taiwanese indigenous peoples, formerly called Taiwanese aborigines, are the indigenous peoples of Taiwan, with the nationally recognized subgroups numbering about 600,303 or 3% of the island&#x27;s population. This total is increased to more than 800,000 if the indigenous peoples of the plains in Taiwan are included, pending future official recognition. When including those of mixed ancestry, such a number is possibly more than a million. Academic research suggests that their ancestors have been living on Taiwan for approximately 15,000 years. A wide body of evidence suggests that the Taiwanese indigenous peoples had maintained regular trade networks with numerous regional cultures of Southeast Asia before the Han Chinese colonists began settling on the island from the 17th century, at the behest of the Dutch colonial administration and later by successive governments towards the 20th century.

Taiwanese indigenous peoples are Austronesians, with linguistic, genetic and cultural ties to other Austronesian peoples. Taiwan is the origin and linguistic homeland of the oceanic Austronesian expansion, whose descendant groups today include the majority of the ethnic groups throughout many parts of East and Southeast Asia as well as Oceania and even Africa which includes Brunei, East Timor, Indonesia, Malaysia, Madagascar, Philippines, Micronesia, Island Melanesia and Polynesia.

For centuries, Taiwan&#x27;s indigenous inhabitants experienced economic competition and military conflict with a series of colonizing newcomers. Centralized government policies designed to foster language shift and cultural assimilation, as well as continued contact with the colonizers through trade, inter-marriage and other intercultural processes, have resulted in varying degrees of language death and loss of original cultural identity. For example, of the approximately 26 known languages of the Taiwanese indigenous peoples – collectively referred to as the Formosan languages – at least ten are now extinct, five are moribund and several are to some degree endangered. These languages are of unique historical significance since most historical linguists consider Taiwan to be the original homeland of the Austronesian languages and all of its primary branches except for Malayo-Polynesian exist only on Taiwan.

Due to discrimination or repression throughout the centuries, the indigenous peoples of Taiwan have experienced economic and social inequality, including a high unemployment rate and substandard education. Some indigenous groups today continue to be unrecognized by the government. Since the early 1980s, many indigenous groups have been actively seeking a higher degree of political self-determination and economic development. The revival of ethnic pride is expressed in many ways by the indigenous peoples, including the incorporation of elements of their culture into cultural commodities such as cultural tourism, pop music and sports. Taiwan&#x27;s Austronesian speakers were formerly distributed over much of the Taiwan archipelago, including the Central Mountain Range villages along the alluvial plains, as well as Orchid Island, Green Island, and Liuqiu Island.

The bulk of contemporary Taiwanese indigenous peoples mostly reside both in their traditional mountain villages as well as increasingly in Taiwan&#x27;s urban areas. There are also the plains indigenous peoples, which have always lived in the lowland areas of the island. Ever since the end of the White Terror, some efforts have been under way in indigenous communities to revive traditional cultural practices and preserve their distinct traditional languages on the now Han Chinese majority island and for the latter to better understand more about them.

== Terminology ==

=== Collective ===
The Ming Dynasty sailor Chen Di, in his &quot;Record of the Eastern Seas&quot; (1603), identifies the indigenous people of Taiwan as simply &quot;Eastern Savages&quot; (), while the Dutch referred to Taiwan&#x27;s original inhabitants as &quot;Indians&quot; or &quot;blacks&quot;, based on their prior colonial experience in what is currently Indonesia.

Beginning nearly a century later, as the rule of the Qing Empire expanded over wider groups of people, writers and gazetteers recast their descriptions away from reflecting degree of acculturation, and toward a system that defined the aborigines relative to their submission or hostility to Qing rule. Qing used the term &quot;raw/wild/uncivilized&quot; () to define those people who had not submitted to Qing rule, and &quot;cooked/tamed/civilized&quot; () for those who had pledged their allegiance through their payment of a head tax. According to the standards of the Qianlong Emperor and successive regimes, the epithet &quot;cooked&quot; was synonymous with having assimilated to Han cultural norms, and living as a subject of the Empire, but it retained a pejorative designation to signify the perceived cultural lacking of the non-Han people. This designation reflected the prevailing idea that anyone could be civilized/tamed by adopting Confucian social norms.

In English, these peoples have also been called Formosans, Native Taiwanese, and Austronesian Taiwanese. The name Gaoshan is also the official label for all indigenous Taiwanese in the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

=== Tribes ===
As the Qing consolidated their power over the plains and struggled to enter the mountains in the late 19th century, the terms &quot;Pingpu&quot; () and &quot;Gaoshan&quot; () were used interchangeably with the epithets &quot;civilized&quot; and &quot;uncivilized&quot;. During Japanese rule (1895–1945), anthropologists from Japan maintained the binary classification. In 1900 they incorporated it into their own colonial project by employing the term for the &quot;civilized tribes&quot;, and creating a category of &quot;recognized tribes&quot; for the aborigines who had formerly been called &quot;uncivilized&quot;. The Musha Incident of 1930 led to many changes in aboriginal policy, and the Japanese government began referring to them as .

&quot;Gaoshan&quot; peoples included the Atayal, Bunun, Tsou, Saisiat, Paiwan, Puyuma, and Amis peoples. The Tao (Yami) and Rukai were added later, for a total of nine recognized peoples. During the early period of Chinese Nationalist Kuomintang (KMT) rule the terms &quot;Shandi Tongbao&quot; () &quot;mountain compatriots&quot; and &quot;Pingdi Tongbao&quot; () &quot;plains compatriots&quot; were invented, to remove the presumed taint of Japanese influence and reflect the place of Taiwan&#x27;s indigenous people in the Chinese Nationalist state. The KMT later adopted the use of all the earlier Japanese groupings except &quot;Peipo&quot;.

Despite recent changes in the field of anthropology and a shift in government objectives, the &quot;Pingpu&quot; and &quot;Gaoshan&quot; labels in use today maintain the form given by the Qing to reflect indigenous&#x27; acculturation to Han culture. The current recognized indigenous are all regarded as &quot;Gaoshan&quot;, though the divisions are not and have never been based strictly on geographical location. The Amis, Saisiat, Tao and Kavalan are all traditionally Eastern Plains cultures. The distinction between &quot;Pingpu&quot; and &quot;Gaoshan&quot; people continues to affect Taiwan&#x27;s policies regarding indigenous peoples, and their ability to participate effectively in government.

Although the ROC&#x27;s Government Information Office officially lists 16 major groupings as &quot;tribes&quot;, the consensus among scholars maintains that these 16 groupings do not reflect any social entities, political collectives, or self-identified alliances dating from pre-modern Taiwan. These divisions did not always correspond to distinctions drawn by the indigenous themselves. The earliest detailed records, dating from the Dutch arrival in 1624, describe the aborigines as living in independent villages of varying size. Between these villages there was frequent trade, intermarriage, warfare and alliances against common enemies. Using contemporary ethnographic and linguistic criteria, these villages have been classed by anthropologists into more than 20 broad (and widely debated) ethnic groupings, which were never united under a common polity, kingdom or &quot;tribe&quot;. However, the categories have become so firmly established in government and popular discourse over time that they have become de facto distinctions, serving to shape in part today&#x27;s political discourse within the Republic of China (ROC), and affecting Taiwan&#x27;s policies regarding indigenous peoples.
Since 2005, some local governments, including Tainan City in 2005, Fuli, Hualien in 2013, and Pingtung County in 2016, have begun to recognize Taiwanese Plain Indigenous peoples. The numbers of people who have successfully registered, including Kaohsiung City Government that has opened to register but not yet recognized, as of 2017 are:
== Recognized peoples ==

=== Indigenous ethnic groups recognized by Taiwan ===

Taiwan officially recognizes distinct people groups among the indigenous community based upon the qualifications drawn up by the Council of Indigenous Peoples (CIP). To gain this recognition, communities must gather a number of signatures and a body of supporting evidence with which to successfully petition the CIP. Formal recognition confers certain legal benefits and rights upon a group, as well as providing them with the satisfaction of recovering their separate identity as an ethnic group. As of June 2014, 16 people groups have been recognized.

The Council of Indigenous Peoples consider several limited factors in a successful formal petition. The determining factors include collecting member genealogies, group histories and evidence of a continued linguistic and cultural identity. The lack of documentation and the extinction of many indigenous languages as the result of colonial cultural and language policies have made the prospect of official recognition of many ethnicities a remote possibility. Current trends in ethno-tourism have led many former Plains Indigenous peoples to continue to seek cultural revival.

Among the Plains groups that have petitioned for official status, only the Kavalan and Sakizaya have been officially recognized. The remaining twelve recognized groups are traditionally regarded as mountain indigenous people.

Other indigenous groups or subgroups that have pressed for recovery of legal indigenous status include Chimo (who have not formally petitioned the government, see ), Kakabu, Makatao, Pazeh, Siraya, and Taivoan. The act of petitioning for recognized status, however, does not always reflect any consensus view among scholars that the relevant group should in fact be categorized as a separate ethnic group. The Siraya will become the 17th ethnic group to be recognized once their status, already recognized by the courts in May 2018, is officially announced by the central government.

There is discussion among both scholars and political groups regarding the best or most appropriate name to use for many of the people groups and their languages, as well as the proper romanization of that name. Commonly cited examples of this ambiguity include (Seediq/Sediq/Truku/Taroko) and (Tao/Yami).

Nine people groups were originally recognized before 1945 by the Japanese government. The Thao, Kavalan and Truku were recognized by Taiwan&#x27;s government in 2001, 2002 and 2004 respectively. The Sakizaya were recognized as a 13th on 17 January 2007, and on 23 April 2008 the Sediq were recognized as Taiwan&#x27;s 14th official ethnic group. Previously the Sakizaya had been listed as Amis and the Sediq as Atayal. Hla&#x27;alua and Kanakanavu were recognized as the 15th and 16th ethnic group on 26 June 2014. A full list of the recognized ethnic groups of Taiwan, as well as some of the more commonly cited unrecognized peoples, is as follows:

:Recognized: Amis, Atayal, Bunun, Hla&#x27;alua, Kanakanavu, Kavalan, Paiwan, Puyuma, Rukai, Saisiyat, Tao, Thao, Tsou, Truku, Sakizaya and Sediq.
:Locally recognized: Makatao (in Pingtung and Fuli), Siraya (in Tainan and Fuli), Taivoan (in Fuli)
:Unrecognized: Babuza, Basay, Hoanya, Ketagalan, Luilang, Pazeh/Kaxabu, Papora, Qauqaut, Taokas, Trobiawan.

=== Indigenous Taiwanese in the PRC ===

The People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) officially recognizes indigenous Taiwanese as one of its ethnic groups under the name &quot;Gāoshān&quot; (高山, ) The 2000 census identified 600 thousand &quot;Gāoshān&quot; living in Taiwan Island; other surveys suggest this accounted for 21 thousand Amis, 51 thousand Bunun, 10.5 thousand Paiwan, with the remainder belonging to other peoples. They are descendants of Taiwanese indigenous living on this island before the 1949 evacuation of the PRC and tracking back further to the Dutch colony in the 17th century. In Zhengzhou, Henan, there exists a &quot;Taiwan Village&quot; (台灣村) whose inhabitants&#x27; ancestors migrated from Taiwan during the Kangxi era of the Qing dynasty. In 2005, 2,674 people of the village identified themselves as Gaoshan.

== Assimilation and acculturation ==
Archeological, linguistic and anecdotal evidence suggests that Taiwan&#x27;s indigenous peoples have undergone a series of cultural shifts to meet the pressures of contact with other societies and new technologies. Beginning in the early 17th century, indigenous Taiwanese faced broad cultural change as the island became incorporated into the wider global economy by a succession of competing colonial regimes from Europe and Asia. In some cases groups of indigenous resisted colonial influence, but other groups and individuals readily aligned with the colonial powers. This alignment could be leveraged to achieve personal or collective economic gain, collective power over neighboring villages or freedom from unfavorable societal customs and taboos involving marriage, age-grade and child birth.

Particularly among the Plains indigenous people, as the degree of the &quot;civilizing projects&quot; increased during each successive regime, the aborigines found themselves in greater contact with outside cultures. The process of acculturation and assimilation sometimes followed gradually in the wake of broad social currents, particularly the removal of ethnic markers (such as bound feet, dietary customs and clothing), which had formerly distinguished ethnic groups on Taiwan. The removal or replacement of these brought about an incremental transformation from &quot;Fan&quot; (番, barbarian) to the dominant Confucian &quot;Han&quot; culture. During the Japanese and KMT periods centralized modernist government policies, rooted in ideas of Social Darwinism and culturalism, directed education, genealogical customs and other traditions toward ethnic assimilation.

Within the Taiwanese Han Hoklo community itself, differences in culture indicate the degree to which mixture with aboriginals took place, with most pure Hoklo Han in Northern Taiwan having almost no Aboriginal admixture, which is limited to Hoklo Han in Southern Taiwan. Plains aboriginals who were mixed and assimilated into the Hoklo Han population at different stages were differentiated by the historian Melissa J. Brown between &quot;short-route&quot; and &quot;long-route&quot; The ethnic identity of assimilated Plains Aboriginals in the immediate vicinity of Tainan was still known since a pure Hoklo Taiwanese girl was warned by her mother to stay away from them. The insulting name &quot;fan&quot; was used against Plains indigenous by the Taiwanese, and the Hoklo Taiwanese speech was forced upon Aborigines like the Pazeh. Hoklo Taiwanese has replaced Pazeh and driven it to near extinction. Indigenous status has been requested by Plains indigenous peoples.

=== Current forms of assimilation ===
Many of these forms of assimilation are still at work today. For example, when a central authority nationalizes one language, that attaches economic and social advantages to the prestige language. As generations pass, use of the indigenous language often fades or disappears, and linguistic and cultural identity recede as well. However, some groups are seeking to revive their indigenous identities. One important political aspect of this pursuit is petitioning the government for official recognition as a separate and distinct ethnic group.

The complexity and scope of aboriginal assimilation and acculturation on Taiwan has led to three general narratives of Taiwanese ethnic change. The oldest holds that Han migration from Fujian and Guangdong in the 17th century pushed the Plains indigenous peoples into the mountains, where they became the Highland peoples of today. A more recent view asserts that through widespread intermarriage between Han and aborigines between the 17th and 19th centuries, the aborigines were completely Sinicized. Finally, modern ethnographical and anthropological studies have shown a pattern of cultural shift mutually experienced by both Han and Plains indigenous, resulting in a hybrid culture. Today people who comprise Taiwan&#x27;s ethnic Han demonstrate major cultural differences from Han elsewhere.

=== Surnames and identity ===
Several factors encouraged the assimilation of the Plains indigenous. Taking a Han name was a necessary step in instilling Confucian values in the aborigines. Confucian values were necessary to be recognized as a full person and to operate within the Confucian Qing state. A surname in Han society was viewed as the most prominent legitimizing marker of a patrilineal ancestral link to the Yellow Emperor (Huang Di) and the Five Emperors of Han mythology. Possession of a Han surname, then, could confer a broad range of significant economic and social benefits upon indigenous, despite a prior non-Han identity or mixed parentage. In some cases, members of Plains indigenous adopted the Han surname Pan (潘) as a modification of their designated status as Fan (番: &quot;barbarian&quot;). One family of Pazeh became members of the local gentry. complete with a lineage to Fujian province. In other cases, families of Plains indigenous adopted common Han surnames, but traced their earliest ancestor to their locality in Taiwan.

In many cases, large groups of immigrant Han would unite under a common surname to form a brotherhood. Brotherhoods were used as a form of defense, as each sworn brother was bound by an oath of blood to assist a brother in need. The brotherhood groups would link their names to a family tree, in essence manufacturing a genealogy based on names rather than blood, and taking the place of the kinship organizations commonly found in China. The practice was so widespread that today&#x27;s family books are largely unreliable. Many Plains indigenous joined the brotherhoods to gain protection of the collective as a type of insurance policy against regional strife, and through these groups they took on a Han identity with a Han lineage.

The degree to which any one of these forces held sway over others is unclear. Preference for one explanation over another is sometimes predicated upon a given political viewpoint. The cumulative effect of these dynamics is that by the beginning of the 20th century the Plains indigenous were almost completely acculturated into the larger ethnic Han group, and had experienced nearly total language shift from their respective Formosan languages to Chinese. In addition, legal barriers to the use of traditional surnames persisted until the 1990s, and cultural barriers remain. Indigenous peoples were not permitted to use their indigenous traditional names on official identification cards until 1995 when a ban on using indigenous names dating from 1946 was finally lifted. One obstacle is that household registration forms allow a maximum of 15 characters for personal names. However, indigenous names are still phonetically translated into Chinese characters, and many names require more than the allotted space. In April 2022, the Constitutional Court ruled that Article 4, Paragraph 2 of the Status Act for Indigenous Peoples was unconstitutional. The paragraph, which reads &quot;Children of intermarriages between Indigenous Peoples and non-Indigenous Peoples taking the surname of the indigenous father or mother, or using a traditional Indigenous Peoples name, shall acquire Indigenous Peoples status,&quot; was ruled unconstitutional after a non-indigenous father had taken his daughter to a household registration office to register her Truku descent. Though the applicant was of Truku descent through her mother, her application used her father&#x27;s Chinese surname and was denied. The Constitutional Court ruled that the law, as written, was a violation of gender equality guaranteed by Article 7 of the Constitution, since children in Taiwan usually take their father&#x27;s surname, which in practice, meant that indigenous status could be acquired via paternal descent, but not maternal descent.

==History==

Indigenous Taiwanese are Austronesian peoples, with linguistic and genetic ties to other Austronesian ethnic groups, such as peoples of the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, Madagascar, and Oceania. Chipped-pebble tools dating from perhaps as early as 15,000 years ago suggest that the initial human inhabitants of Taiwan were Paleolithic cultures of the Pleistocene era. These people survived by eating marine life. Archeological evidence points to an abrupt change to the Neolithic era around 6,000 years ago, with the advent of agriculture, domestic animals, polished stone adzes and pottery. The stone adzes were mass-produced on Penghu and nearby islands, from the volcanic rock found there. This suggests heavy sea traffic took place between these islands and Taiwan at this time.

From around 5000 to 1500 BC, Taiwanese indigenous peoples started a seaborne migration to the island of Luzon in the Philippines, intermingling with the older Negrito populations of the islands. This was the beginning of the Austronesian expansion. They spread throughout the rest of the Philippines and eventually migrated further to the other islands of Southeast Asia, Micronesia, Island Melanesia, Polynesia, and Madagascar. Taiwan is the homeland of the Austronesian languages.

There is evidence that indigenous Taiwanese continued trading with the Philippines in the Sa Huynh-Kalanay Interaction Sphere. Eastern Taiwan was the source of jade for the &quot;lingling-o&quot; jade industry in the Philippines and the Sa Huỳnh culture of Vietnam. This trading network began between the animist communities of Taiwan and the Philippines which later became the Maritime Jade Road, one of the most extensive sea-based trade networks of a single geological material in the prehistoric world. It was in existence for 3,000 years from 2000 BCE to 1000 CE.

Four centuries of non-indigenous rule can be viewed through several changing periods of governing power and shifting official policy toward aborigines. From the 17th century until the early 20th, the impact of the foreign settlers—the Dutch, Spanish, and Han—was more extensive on the Plains peoples. They were far more geographically accessible than the Mountain peoples, and thus had more dealings with the foreign powers. The reactions of indigenous people to imperial power show not only acceptance, but also incorporation or resistance through their cultural practices.

By the beginning of the 20th century, the Plains peoples had largely been assimilated into contemporary Taiwanese culture as a result of European and Han colonial rule. Until the latter half of the Japanese colonial era the Mountain peoples were not entirely governed by any non-indigenous polity. However, the mid-1930s marked a shift in the intercultural dynamic, as the Japanese began to play a far more dominant role in the culture of the Highland groups. This increased degree of control over the Mountain peoples continued during Kuomintang rule. Within these two broad eras, there were many differences in the individual and regional impact of the colonizers and their &quot;civilizing projects&quot;. At times the foreign powers were accepted readily, as some communities adopted foreign clothing styles and cultural practices , and engaged in cooperative trade in goods such as camphor, deer hides, sugar, tea, and rice. At numerous other times changes from the outside world were forcibly imposed.

=== Plains indigenous peoples ===
The plains indigenous peoples mainly lived in stationary village sites surrounded by defensive walls of bamboo. The village sites in southern Taiwan were more populated than other locations. Some villages supported a population of more than 1,500 people, surrounded by smaller satellite villages. Siraya villages were constructed of dwellings made of thatch and bamboo, raised from the ground on stilts, with each household having a barn for livestock. A watchtower was located in the village to look out for headhunting parties from the Highland peoples. The concept of property was often communal, with a series of conceptualized concentric rings around each village. The innermost ring was used for gardens and orchards that followed a fallowing cycle around the ring. The second ring was used to cultivate plants and natural fibers for the exclusive use of the community. The third ring was for exclusive hunting and deer fields for community use. The plains indigenous peoples hunted herds of spotted Formosan sika deer, Formosan sambar deer and Reeves&#x27;s muntjac as well as conducting light millet farming. Sugar and rice were grown as well, but mostly for use in preparing wine.

Many of the plains indigenous peoples were matrilineal/matrifocal societies. A man married into a woman&#x27;s family after a courtship period during which the woman was free to reject as many men as she wished. In the age-grade communities, couples entered into marriage in their mid-30s when a man would no longer be required to perform military service or hunt heads on the battle-field. In the matriarchal system of the Siraya, it was also necessary for couples to abstain from marriage until their mid-30s, when the bride&#x27;s father would be in his declining years and would not pose a challenge to the new male member of the household. It was not until the arrival of the Dutch Reformed Church in the 17th century that the marriage and child-birth taboos were abolished. There is some indication that many of the younger members of Sirayan society embraced the Dutch marriage customs as a means to circumvent the age-grade system in a push for greater village power. Almost all indigenous peoples in Taiwan have traditionally had a custom of sexual division of labor. Women did the sewing, cooking and farming, while the men hunted and prepared for military activity and securing enemy heads in headhunting raids, which was a common practice in early Taiwan. Women were also often found in the office of priestesses or mediums to the gods.

For centuries, Taiwan&#x27;s aboriginal peoples experienced economic competition and military conflict with a series of colonizing peoples. Centralized government policies designed to foster language shift and cultural assimilation, as well as continued contact with the colonizers through trade, intermarriage and other dispassionate intercultural processes, have resulted in varying degrees of language death and loss of original cultural identity. For example, of the approximately 26 known languages of the Taiwanese aborigines (collectively referred to as the Formosan languages), at least ten are extinct, five are moribund and several are to some degree endangered. These languages are of unique historical significance, since most historical linguists consider Taiwan to be the original homeland of the Austronesian language family.

===Contact with Chinese===

Early Chinese histories refer to visits to eastern islands that some historians identify with Taiwan. Troops of the Three Kingdoms state of Eastern Wu are recorded visiting an island known as Yizhou in the spring of 230. They brought back several thousand natives but 80 to 90 percent of the soldiers died to unknown diseases. Some scholars have identified this island as Taiwan while others do not. The &quot;Book of Sui&quot; relates that Emperor Yang of the Sui dynasty sent three expeditions to a place called &quot;Liuqiu&quot; early in the 7th century. They brought back captives, cloth, and armour. The Liuqiu described by the &quot;Book of Sui&quot; had pigs and chicken but no cows, sheep, donkeys, or horses. It produced little iron, had no writing system, taxation, or penal code, and was ruled by a king with four or five commanders. The natives used stone blades and practiced slash-and-burn agriculture to grow rice, millet, sorghum, and beans. Later the name Liuqiu (whose characters are read in Japanese as &quot;Ryukyu&quot;) referred to the island chain to the northeast of Taiwan, but some scholars believe it may have referred to Taiwan in the Sui period.

During the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368), Han Chinese people started visiting Taiwan. The Yuan emperor Kublai Khan sent officials to the Ryukyu Kingdom in 1292 to demand its loyalty to the Yuan dynasty, but the officials ended up in Taiwan and mistook it for Ryukyu. After three soldiers were killed, the delegation immediately retreated to Quanzhou in China. Another expedition was sent in 1297. Wang Dayuan visited Taiwan in 1349 and noted that the customs of its inhabitants were different from those of Penghu&#x27;s population, but did not mention the presence of other Chinese. He mentioned the presence of Chuhou pottery from present day Lishui, Zhejiang, suggesting that Chinese merchants had already visited the island by the 1340s.

By the early 16th century, increasing numbers of Chinese fishermen, traders and pirates were visiting the southwestern part of the island. Some merchants from Fujian were familiar enough with the indigenous peoples of Taiwan to speak Formosan languages. The people of Fujian sailed closer to Taiwan and the Ryukyus in the mid-16th century to trade with Japan while evading Ming authorities. Chinese who traded in Southeast Asia also began taking an East Sea Compass Course (&quot;dongyang zhenlu&quot;) that passed southwestern and southern Taiwan. Some of them traded with the Taiwanese aborigines. During this period, Taiwan was referred to as &quot;Xiaodong dao&quot; (&quot;little eastern island&quot;) and &quot;Dahui guo&quot; (&quot;the country of Dahui&quot;), a corruption of Tayouan, a tribe that lived on an islet near modern Tainan from which the name &quot;Taiwan&quot; is derived. By the late 16th century, Chinese from Fujian were settling in southwestern Taiwan. The Chinese pirates Lin Daoqian and Lin Feng visited Taiwan in 1563 and 1574 respectively. Lin Daoqian was a pirate from Chaozhou who fled to Beigang in southwestern Taiwan and left shortly after. Lin Feng moved his pirate forces to Wankan (in modern Chiayi County) in Taiwan on 3 November 1574 and used it as a base to launch raids. They left for Penghu after being attacked by natives and the Ming navy dislodged them from their bases. He later returned to Wankan on 27 December 1575 but left for Southeast Asia after losing a naval encounter with Ming forces on 15 January 1576. The pirate Yan Siqi also used Taiwan as a base. In 1593, Ming officials started issuing ten licenses each year for Chinese junks to trade in northern Taiwan. Chinese records show that after 1593, each year five licenses were granted for trade in Keelung and five licenses for Tamsui. However these licenses merely acknowledged already existing illegal trade at these locations.

Initially Chinese merchants arrived in northern Taiwan and sold iron and textiles to the Taiwanese indigenous peoples in return for coal, sulfur, gold, and venison. Later the southwestern part of Taiwan surpassed northern Taiwan as the destination for Chinese traders. The southwest had mullet fish, which drew more than a hundred fishing junks from Fujian each year during winter. The fishing season lasted six to eight weeks. Some of them camped on Taiwan&#x27;s shores and many began trading with the indigenous people for deer products. The southwestern Taiwanese trade was of minor importance until after 1567 when it was used as a way to circumvent the ban on Sino-Japanese trade. The Chinese bought deerskins from the aborigines and sold them to the Japanese for a large profit.

When a Portuguese ship sailed past southwestern Taiwan in 1596, several of its crew members who had been shipwrecked there in 1582 noticed that the land had become cultivated and now had people working it, presumably by settlers from Fujian. When the Dutch arrived in 1623, they found about 1,500 Chinese visitors and residents. Most of them were engaged in seasonal fishing, hunting, and trading. The population fluctuated throughout the year peaking during winter. A small minority brought Chinese plants with them and grew crops such as apples, oranges, bananas, watermelons. Some estimates of the Chinese population put it at 2,000. There were two Chinese villages. The larger one was located on an island that formed the Bay of Tayouan. It was inhabited year-round. The smaller village was located on the mainland and would eventually become the city of Tainan. In the early 17th century, a Chinese man described it as being inhabited by pirates and fishermen. One Dutch visitor noted that an aboriginal village near the Sino-Japanese trade center had a large number of Chinese and there was &quot;scarcely a house in this village... that does not have one or two or three, or even five or six Chinese living there.&quot; The villagers&#x27; speech contained many Chinese words and sounded like &quot;a mixed and broken language&quot;.

Chen Di visited Taiwan in 1603 on an expedition against the Wokou pirates. General Shen of Wuyu defeated the pirates and met a native chieftain named Damila who presented them with gifts. Chen witnessed these events and wrote an account of Taiwan known as &quot;Dongfanji&quot; (An Account of the Eastern Barbarians). According to Chen, Zheng He visited the natives but they remained hidden. Afterwards they came into contact with Chinese people from the harbors of Huimin, Chonglong, and Lieyu in Zhangzhou and Quanzhou. They learned their languages to trade with them. Chinese items such as agate beads, porcelain, cloth, salt, and brass were traded in return for deer meat, skins, and horns.

=== European period (1623–1662) ===
During the European period (1623–1662) soldiers and traders representing the Dutch East India Company maintained a colony in southwestern Taiwan (1624–1662) near present-day Tainan. This established an Asian base for triangular trade between the company, the Qing dynasty and Japan, with the hope of interrupting Portuguese and Spanish trading alliances with China. The Spanish also established a small colony in northern Taiwan (1626–1642) in present-day Keelung. However, Spanish influence wavered almost from the beginning, so that by the late 1630s they had already withdrawn most of their troops. After they were driven out of Taiwan by a combined Dutch and aboriginal force in 1642, the Spanish &quot;had little effect on Taiwan&#x27;s history&quot;. Dutch influence was far more significant: expanding to the southwest and north of the island, they set up a tax system and established schools and churches in many villages.

When the Dutch arrived in 1624 at Tayouan (Anping) Harbor, Siraya-speaking representatives from nearby Saccam village soon appeared at the Dutch stockade to barter and trade; an overture which was readily welcomed by the Dutch. The Sirayan villages were, however, divided into warring factions: the village of Sinckan (Sinshih) was at war with Mattau (Madou) and its ally Baccluan, while the village of Soulang maintained uneasy neutrality. In 1629 a Dutch expeditionary force searching for Han pirates was massacred by warriors from Mattau, and the victory inspired other villages to rebel. In 1635, with reinforcements having arrived from Batavia (now Jakarta, Indonesia), the Dutch subjugated and burned Mattau. Since Mattau was the most powerful village in the area, the victory brought a spate of peace offerings from other nearby villages, many of which were outside the Siraya area. This was the beginning of Dutch consolidation over large parts of Taiwan, which brought an end to centuries of inter-village warfare. The new period of peace allowed the Dutch to construct schools and churches aimed to acculturate and convert the indigenous population. Dutch schools taught a romanized script (Sinckan writing), which transcribed the Siraya language. This script maintained occasional use through the 18th century. Today only fragments survive, in documents and stone stele markers. The schools also served to maintain alliances and open aboriginal areas for Dutch enterprise and commerce.

The Dutch soon found trade in deerskins and venison in the East Asian market to be a lucrative endeavor and recruited plains indigenous peoples to procure the hides. The deer trade attracted the first Han traders to indigenous villages, but as early as 1642 the demand for deer greatly diminished the deer stocks. This drop significantly reduced the prosperity of indigenous peoples, forcing many aborigines to take up farming to counter the economic impact of losing their most vital food source.

As the Dutch began subjugating indigenous villages in the south and west of Taiwan, increasing numbers of Han immigrants looked to exploit areas that were fertile and rich in game. The Dutch initially encouraged this, since the Han were skilled in agriculture and large-scale hunting. Several Han took up residence in Siraya villages. The Dutch used Han agents to collect taxes, hunting license fees and other income. This set up a society in which &quot;many of the colonists were Han Chinese but the military and the administrative structures were Dutch&quot;. Despite this, local alliances transcended ethnicity during the Dutch period. For example, the Guo Huaiyi Rebellion in 1652, a Han farmers&#x27; uprising, was defeated by an alliance of 120 Dutch musketeers with the aid of Han loyalists and 600 indigenous warriors.

Multiple indigenous villages in frontier areas rebelled against the Dutch in the 1650s due to oppression such as when the Dutch ordered indigenous women for sex, deer pelts, and rice be given to them from indigenous in the Taipei Basin in Wu-lao-wan village which sparked a rebellion in December 1652 at the same time as the Chinese rebellion. Two Dutch translators were beheaded by the Wu-lao-wan indigenous people and in a subsequent fight, 30 indigenous and another two Dutch people died. After an embargo of salt and iron on Wu-lao-wan, the indigenous people were forced to sue for peace in February 1653.

The Dutch period ended in 1662 when Ming loyalist forces of Zheng Chenggong (Koxinga) drove out the Dutch and established the short-lived Zheng family kingdom on Taiwan. Dutch colonialism left different impressions on different indigenous groups in Taiwan. The Koaluts (Guizaijiao) tribe of the Paiwan people attacked American survivors of a shipwreck during the Rover incident in 1867. The chief, Tanketok, explained that this was because in ages past, the white men came and almost exterminated their tribe, and their ancestors passed down their desire for revenge. According to William A. Pickering in his &quot;Pioneering in Formosa&quot; (1898), the old people of Kong-a-na, about 15 miles from Sin-kang, loved white men and the old women there said they were their kindred.

===Kingdom of Tungning (1661–1683)===
The Kingdom of Tungning was established by Zheng Chenggong (Koxinga) after arriving in Taiwan in 1661 and ousting the Dutch in 1662. The Taiwanese indigenous tribes who were previously allied with the Dutch against the Chinese during the Guo Huaiyi rebellion in 1652 turned against the Dutch during the Siege of Fort Zeelandia and defected to Koxinga&#x27;s Chinese forces. The aboriginals of Sincan defected to Koxinga after he offered them amnesty. The Sincan indigenous people then proceeded to work for the Chinese and behead Dutch people in executions. The frontier indigenous in the mountains and plains also surrendered and defected to the Chinese on 17 May 1661, celebrating their freedom from compulsory education under the Dutch rule by hunting down Dutch people and beheading them and trashing their Christian school textbooks.

Koxinga&#x27;s son and successor, Zheng Jing, dispatched teachers to indigenous tribes to provide them with supplies and teach them more advanced farming techniques. He also gave them Ming gowns and caps while eating with their chiefs and gifting tobacco to indigenous people who were gathered in crowds to meet and welcome him as he visited their villages after he defeated the Dutch. Schools were set up to teach the indigenous people the Chinese language, writing, and the Confucian Classics. Those who refused were punished.

Zhengs brought 70,000 soldiers to Taiwan and immediately began clearing large tracts of land to support its forces. The expansion of Chinese settlements often came at the expense of aboriginal tribes, causing rebellions flared up over the course of Zheng rule. In one campaign, several hundred Shalu tribes people in modern Taichung were killed. By the start of 1684, a year after the end of Zheng rule, areas under cultivation in Taiwan had tripled in size since the end of the Dutch era in 1660.

=== Qing dynasty rule (1683–1895) ===

====Quarantine policies====
After the Qing dynasty government defeated the Ming loyalist forces maintained by the Zheng family in 1683, Taiwan became increasingly integrated into the Qing dynasty. Qing forces ruled areas of Taiwan&#x27;s highly populated western plain for over two centuries, until 1895. This era was characterized by a marked increase in the number of Han Chinese on Taiwan, continued social unrest, the piecemeal transfer (by various means) of large amounts of land from the indigenous to the Han, and the nearly complete acculturation of the Western Plains indigenous people to Chinese Han customs.

During the Qing dynasty&#x27;s two-century rule over Taiwan, the population of Han on the island increased dramatically. However, it is not clear to what extent this was due to an influx of Han settlers, who were predominantly displaced young men from Zhangzhou and Quanzhou in Fujian province. The Qing government officially sanctioned controlled Han settlement, but sought to manage tensions between the various regional and ethnic groups. Therefore, it often recognized the plains peoples&#x27; claims to deer fields and traditional territory. The Qing authorities hoped to turn the Plains peoples into loyal subjects, and adopted the head and corvée taxes on the indigenous, which made the plains indigenous people directly responsible for payment to the government yamen. The attention paid by the Qing authorities to indigenous land rights was part of a larger administrative goal to maintain a level of peace on the turbulent Taiwan frontier, which was often marred by ethnic and regional conflict. The frequency of rebellions, riots, and civil strife in Qing dynasty Taiwan is often encapsulated in the saying &quot;every three years an uprising; every five years a rebellion&quot;.

In 1723, aborigines living in Dajiaxi village along the central coastal plain rebelled. Government troops from southern Taiwan were sent to put down this revolt, but in their absence, Han settlers in Fengshan County rose up in revolt under the leadership of Wu Fusheng, a settler from Zhangzhou. Indigenous participation in major revolts during the Qing era, including the Taokas-led Ta-Chia-hsi revolt of 1731–1732, ensured the Plains peoples would remain an important factor in crafting Qing frontier policy until the end of Qing rule in 1895. By 1732, five different ethnic groups were in revolt but the rebellion was defeated by the end of the year.

The struggle over land resources was one source of conflict. Large areas of the western plain were subject to large land rents called &quot;Huan Da Zu&quot; (番大租—literally, &quot;Barbarian Big Rent&quot;), a category which remained until the period of Japanese colonization. The large tracts of deer field, guaranteed by the Qing, were owned by the communities and their individual members. The communities would commonly offer Han farmers a permanent patent for use, while maintaining ownership (skeleton) of the subsoil (田骨), which was called &quot;two lords to a field&quot; (一田兩主). The Plains peoples were often cheated out of land or pressured to sell at unfavorable rates. Some disaffected subgroups moved to central or eastern Taiwan, but most remained in their ancestral locations and acculturated or assimilated into Han society. Despite this, the vast majority of rebellions did not originate from indigenous peoples but the Han settlers, and the mountain aborigines were left to their own devices until the last 20 years of Qing rule. During the Qianlong period (1735–1796), the 93 &quot;shufan&quot; acculturated aborigine villages never rebelled and over 200 non-acculturated aboriginal villages submitted.

During the reigns of the Kangxi (r. 1661–1722), Yongzheng (r. 1722–1735), and Qianlong (r. 1735–1796) emperors, the Qing court deliberately restricted the expansion of territory and government administration in Taiwan. A government permit was required for settlers to go beyond the Dajia River at the mid-point of the western plains. In 1715, the governor-general of Fujian-Zhejiang recommended land reclamation in Taiwan but Kangxi was worried that this would cause instability and conflicts. By the time of Yongzheng&#x27;s reign, the Qing extended control over the entire western plains, but this was to better control the settlers and maintain security. The quarantine policies were maintained. After the Zhu Yigui uprising which occurred in 1721, Lan Dingyuan, an advisor to Lan Tingzhen, who led forces against the rebellion, advocated for expansion and land reclamation to strengthen government control over the Chinese settlers. He wanted to convert the aborigines to Han culture and turn them into subjects of the Qing. However, the Qianlong Emperor kept the administrative structure of Taiwan largely unchanged and in 1744, he dismissed recommendations by officials to allow settlers to claim land.

====Qing classification of indigenous peoples====
The Qing did little to administer the indigenous and rarely tried to subjugate or impose cultural change upon them. Indigenous peoples were classified into two general categories: acculturated aborigines (&quot;shufan&quot;) and non-acculturated aborigines (&quot;shengfan&quot;). &quot;Sheng&quot; is a word used to describe uncooked food, unworked land, unripened-fruit, unskilled labor or strangers, while &quot;shu&quot; bears the opposite meaning. To the Qing, &quot;shufan&quot; were indigenous who paid taxes, performed corvée, and had adopted Han Chinese culture to some degree. When the Qing annexed Taiwan, there were 46 indigenous villages under government control: 12 in Fengshan and 34 in Zhuluo. These were likely inherited from the Zheng regime. In the Yongzheng period, 108 indigenous villages submitted as a result of encouragement and enticement from the Taiwan regional commander, Lin Liang. &quot;Shengfan&quot; who paid taxes but did not perform corvée and did not practice Han Chinese culture were called &quot;guihua shengfan&quot; (submitted non-acculturated aborigines).

The Qianlong administration forbade enticing indigenous to submit due to fear of conflict. In the early Qianlong period, there were 299 named indigenous villages. Records show 93 &quot;shufan&quot; villages and 61 &quot;guihua shengfan&quot; villages. The number of &quot;shufan&quot; villages remained stable throughout the Qianlong period. Two indigenous affairs sub-prefects were appointed to manage aboriginal affairs in 1766. One was in charge of the north and the other in charge of the south, both focused on the plains aborigines. Boundaries were built to keep the mountain indigenous people out of settlement areas. The policy of marking settler boundaries and segregating them from indigenous territories became official policy in 1722 in response to the Zhu Yigui uprising. Fifty-four stelae were used to mark crucial points along the settler-indigenous boundary. Han settlers were forbidden from crossing into indigenous territory but settler encroachment continued, and the boundaries were rebuilt in 1750, 1760, 1784, and 1790. Settlers were forbidden from marrying indigenous as marriage was one way settlers obtained land. While the settlers drove colonization and acculturation, the Qing policy of quarantine dented the impact on aborigines, especially mountain indigenous people.

====Settler expansion====
Although Qing quarantine policies were maintained in the early 19th century, attitudes towards indigenous territories started to shift. Local officials repeatedly advocated for the colonization of indigenous territories, especially in the cases of Gamalan and Shuishalian. The Gamalan or Kavalan people were situated in modern Yilan County in northeastern Taiwan. It was separated from the western plains and Tamsui (Danshui) by mountains. There were 36 indigenous villages in the area and the Kavalan people had started paying taxes as early as the Kangxi period (r. 1661–1722), but they were non-acculturated &quot;guihua shengfan&quot; aborigines.

In 1787, a Chinese settler named Wu Sha tried to reclaim land in Gamalan but was defeated by indigenous people. The next year, the Tamsui sub-prefect convinced the Taiwan prefect, Yang Tingli, to support Wu Sha. Yang recommended subjugating the natives and opening Gamalan for settlement to the Fujian governor but the governor refused to act due to fear of conflict. In 1797, a new Tamsui sub-prefect issued permit and financial support for Wu to recruit settlers for land reclamation, which was illegal. Wu&#x27;s successors were unable to register the reclaimed land on government registers. Local officials supported land reclamation but could not officially recognize it.

In 1806 it was reported that a pirate, Cai Qian, was within the vicinity of Gamalan. Taiwan Prefect Yang once again recommended opening up Gamalan, arguing that to abandon it would cause trouble on the frontier. Later another pirate band tried to occupy Gamalan. Yang recommended to the Fuzhou General Saichong&#x27;a the establishment of administration and land surveys in Gamalan. Saichong&#x27;a initially refused but then changed his mind and sent a memorial to the emperor in 1808 recommending the incorporation of Gamalan. The issue was discussed by the central government officials and for the first time, one official went on record saying that if aboriginal territory was incorporated, not only would it end the pirate threat but the government would stand to profit from the land itself. In 1809, the emperor ordered for Gamalan to be incorporated. The next year an imperial decree for the formal incorporation of Gamalan was issued and a Gamalan sub-prefect was appointed.

Unlike Gamalan, debates on Shuishalian resulted in its continued status as a closed-off area. Shuishalian refers to the upstream areas of the Zhuoshui River and Wu River in central Taiwan. The inner mountain area of Shuishalian was inhabited by 24 indigenous villages and six of them occupied the flat and fertile basin area. The indigenous had submitted as early as 1693 but they remained non-acculturated. In 1814, some settlers were able to obtain reclamation permits through fabricating aboriginal land lease requests. In 1816, the government sent troops to evict the settlers and destroy their strongholds. Stelae were erected demarcating the land forbidden to Chinese settlers.

Local officials advocated for supporting colonization efforts into the mid-1800s but their recommendations were ignored.

==== Migration to highlands ====
One popular narrative holds that all of the Gaoshan peoples were originally Plains peoples, which fled to the mountains under pressure from Han encroachment. This strong version of the &quot;migration&quot; theory has been largely discounted by contemporary research as the Gaoshan people demonstrate a physiology, material cultures and customs that have been adapted for life at higher elevations. Linguistic, archeological, and recorded anecdotal evidence also suggests there has been island-wide migration of indigenous peoples for over 3,000 years.

Small sub-groups of Plains Indigenous Peoples may have occasionally fled to the mountains, foothills or eastern plain to escape hostile groups of Han or other aborigines.
The &quot;displacement scenario&quot; is more likely rooted in the older customs of many Plains groups to withdraw into the foothills during headhunting season or when threatened by a neighboring village, as observed by the Dutch during their punitive campaign of Mattou in 1636 when the bulk of the village retreated to Tevorangh.
The &quot;displacement scenario&quot; may also stem from the inland migrations of Plains indigenous subgroups, who were displaced by either Han or other Plains indigenous and chose to move to the Iilan plain in 1804, the Puli basin in 1823 and another Puli migration in 1875. Each migration consisted of a number of families and totaled hundreds of people, not entire communities. There are also recorded oral histories that recall some Plains indigenous people were sometimes captured and killed by Highlands peoples while relocating through the mountains. However, as explained in detail, documented evidence shows that the majority of Plains people remained on the plains, intermarried Hakka and Hoklo immigrants from Fujian and Guangdong, and adopted a Han identity.

====Colonization in reaction to crises====
In 1874, Japan invaded indigenous territory in southern Taiwan in what is known as the Mudan Incident (Japanese invasion of Taiwan (1874)). For six months Japanese soldiers occupied southern Taiwan and Japan argued that it was not part of the Qing dynasty. The result was the payment of an indemnity by the Qing in return for the Japanese army&#x27;s withdrawal.

The imperial commissioner for Taiwan, Shen Baozhen, argued that &quot;the reason that Taiwan is being coveted by [Japan] is that the land is too empty.&quot; He recommended subjugating the indigenous and populating their territory with Chinese settlers. As a result, the administration of Taiwan was expanded and campaigns against the indigenous were launched. The two sub-prefects responsible for indigenous affairs were moved to inner Shushalian (Puli) and eastern Taiwan (Beinan), the focal points for colonization. Starting in 1874, mountain roads were built to make the region more accessible and indigenous people were brought into formal submission to the Qing. In 1875, the ban on entering Taiwan was lifted. In 1877, 21 guidelines on subjugating indigenous peoples and opening the mountains were issued. Agencies for recruiting settlers were established on the coastal mainland and in Hong Kong. However efforts to promote settlement in Taiwan petered out soon after.

Efforts to settle in indigenous territories were renewed under the governance of Liu Mingchuan after the Sino-French War ended in 1885. However few settlers went to Taiwan and those that did were accosted by aborigines and the harsh climate. Governor Liu was criticized for the high cost and little gain from the colonization activities. Liu resigned in 1891 and the colonization efforts ceased.

A Taiwan Pacification and Reclamation Head Office was established with eight pacification and reclamation bureaus. Four bureaus were located in eastern Taiwan, two in Puli (inner Shuishalian), one in the north, and one on the western border of the mountains. By 1887, about 500 indigenous villages, or roughly 90,000 indigenous had formally submitted to Qing rule. This number increased to 800 villages with 148,479 indigenous over the following years. However the cost of getting them to submit was exorbitant. The Qing offered them materials and paid village chiefs monthly allowances. Not all the indigenous were under effective control and land reclamation in eastern Taiwan occurred at a slow pace. From 1884 to 1891, Liu launched more than 40 military campaigns against the aborigines with 17,500 soldiers. A third of the invasion force was killed or disabled in the conflict, amounting to a costly failure.

By the end of the Qing period, the western plains were fully developed as farmland with about 2.5 million Chinese settlers. The mountainous areas were still largely autonomous under the control of indigenous. Indigenous land loss under the Qing occurred at a relatively slow pace compared to the following Japanese colonial period due to the absence of state sponsored land deprivation for the majority of Qing rule. In the 50-year period of Japanese rule that followed, the Taiwanese aborigines lost their right to legal ownership of land and were confined to small reserves one-eighth the size of their ancestral lands. However even had Japan not taken over Taiwan, the plains indigenous were on the way to losing their residual rights to land. By the last years of Qing rule, most of the plains aborigines had been acculturated to Han culture, around 20–30% could speak their mother tongues, and gradually lost their land ownership and rent collection rights.

=== Highland peoples ===

Imperial Chinese and European societies had little contact with the Highland indigenous until expeditions to the region by European and American explorers and missionaries commenced in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The lack of data before this was primarily the result of a Qing quarantine on the region to the east of the &quot;earth oxen&quot; (土牛) border, which ran along the eastern edge of the western plain. Han contact with the mountain peoples was usually associated with the enterprise of gathering and extracting camphor from Camphor Laurel trees (&quot;Cinnamomum camphora&quot;), native to the island and in particular the mountainous areas. The production and shipment of camphor (used in herbal medicines and mothballs) was then a significant industry on the island, lasting up to and including the period of Japanese rule. These early encounters often involved headhunting parties from the Highland peoples, who sought out and raided unprotected Han forest workers. Together with traditional Han concepts of Taiwanese behavior, these raiding incidents helped to promote the Qing-era popular image of the &quot;violent&quot; aborigine.

Taiwanese Plains indigenous were often employed and dispatched as interpreters to assist in the trade of goods between Han merchants and Highlands aborigines. The indigenous people traded cloth, pelts and meat for iron and matchlock rifles. Iron was a necessary material for the fabrication of hunting knives—long, curved sabers that were generally used as a forest tool. These blades became notorious among Han settlers, given their alternative use to decapitate Highland indigenous enemies in customary headhunting expeditions.

==== Headhunting ====

Every tribe except the Tao people of Orchid Island practiced headhunting, which was a symbol of bravery and valor. Men who did not take heads could not cross the rainbow bridge into the spirit world upon death as per the religion of Gaya. Each tribe has its own origin story for the tradition of headhunting but the theme is similar across tribes. After the great flood, headhunting originated due to boredom (South Tsou Sa&#x27;arua, Paiwan), to improve tribal singing (Ali Mountain Tsou), as a form of population control (Atayal, Taroko, Bunun), simply for amusement and fun (Rukai, Tsou, Puyuma) or particularly for the fun and excitement of killing intellectually disabled individuals (Amis). Once the victims had been decapitated and displayed the heads were boiled and left to dry, often hanging from trees or displayed on slate shelves referred to as &quot;skull racks&quot;. A party returning with a head was cause for celebration, as it was believed to bring good luck and the spiritual power of the slaughtered individual was believed to transfer into the headhunter. If the head was that of a woman it was even better because it meant she could not bear children. The Bunun people would often take prisoners and inscribe prayers or messages to their dead on arrows, then shoot their prisoner with the hope their prayers would be carried to the dead. Taiwanese Hoklo Han settlers and Japanese were often the victims of headhunting raids as they were considered by the indigenous to be liars and enemies. A headhunting raid would often strike at workers in the fields, or set a dwelling alight and then decapitate the inhabitants as they fled the burning structure. It was also customary to later raise the victim&#x27;s surviving children as full members of the community. Often the heads themselves were ceremonially &#x27;invited&#x27; to join the community as members, where they were supposed to watch over the community and keep them safe. The indigenous inhabitants of Taiwan accepted the convention and practice of headhunting as one of the calculated risks of community life. The last groups to practice headhunting were the Paiwan, Bunun, and Atayal groups. Japanese rule ended the practice by 1930, (though Japanese were not subject to this regulation and continued to headhunt their enemies throughout World War II) and as late as 2003 there are elder Taiwanese that could recall the practice firsthand.

=== Japanese rule (1895–1945) ===
When the Treaty of Shimonoseki was finalized on 17 April 1895, Taiwan was ceded by the Qing Empire to Japan. Taiwan&#x27;s incorporation into the Japanese political orbit brought Taiwanese indigenous into contact with a new colonial structure, determined to define and locate indigenous people within the framework of a new, multi-ethnic empire. The means of accomplishing this goal took three main forms: anthropological study of the natives of Taiwan, attempts to reshape the indigenous in the mold of the Japanese, and military suppression. The indigenous and Han joined to violently revolt against Japanese rule in the 1907 Beipu Uprising and 1915 Tapani Incident.

Japan&#x27;s sentiment regarding indigenous peoples was crafted around the memory of the Mudan Incident, when, in 1871, a group of 54 shipwrecked Ryūkyūan sailors was massacred by a Paiwan group from the village of Mudan in southern Taiwan. The resulting Japanese policy, published twenty years before the onset of their rule on Taiwan, cast Taiwanese indigenous as &quot;vicious, violent and cruel&quot; and concluded &quot;this is a pitfall of the world; we must get rid of them all&quot;. Japanese campaigns to gain aboriginal submission were often brutal, as evidenced in the desire of Japan&#x27;s first Governor General, Kabayama Sukenori, to &quot;conquer the barbarians&quot; . The Seediq indigenous fought against the Japanese in multiple battles such as the Xincheng incident (新城事件), Truku battle (太魯閣之役) (Taroko), 1902 Renzhiguan incident (人止關事件), and the 1903 Zimeiyuan incident (姊妹原事件). In the Musha Incident of 1930, for example, a Seediq group was decimated by artillery and supplanted by the Taroko (Truku), which had sustained periods of bombardment from naval ships and airplanes dropping mustard gas. A quarantine was placed around the mountain areas enforced by armed guard stations and electrified fences until the most remote high mountain villages could be relocated closer to administrative control.

A divide and rule policy was formulated with Japan trying to play indigenous and Han against each other to their own benefit when Japan alternated between fighting the two with Japan first fighting Han and then fighting indigenous. Nationalist Japanese claim indigenous were treated well by Kabayama. &quot;unenlightened and stubbornly stupid&quot; were the words used to describe indigenous by Kabayama Sukenori. A hardline anti indigenous position aimed at the destruction of their civilization was implemented by Fukuzawa Yukichi. The most tenacioius opposition was mounted by the Bunan and Atayal against the Japanese during the brutal mountain war in 1913–14 under Sakuma. Indigenous continued to fight against the Japanese after 1915. Aboriginals were subjected to military takeover and assimilation. In order to exploit camphor resources, the Japanese fought against the Bngciq Atayal in 1906 and expelled them. The war is called &quot;Camphor War&quot; (樟腦戰爭).

The Bunun indigenous under Chief Raho Ari (or Dahu Ali, , lāhè āléi) engaged in guerilla warfare against the Japanese for twenty years. Raho Ari&#x27;s revolt was sparked when the Japanese implemented a gun control policy in 1914 against the indigenous people in which their rifles were impounded in police stations when hunting expeditions were over. The Dafen incident began at Dafen when a police platoon was slaughtered by Raho Ari&#x27;s clan in 1915. A settlement holding 266 people called Tamaho was created by Raho Ari and his followers near the source of the Laonong River and attracted more Bunun rebels to their cause. Raho Ari and his followers captured bullets and guns and slew Japanese in repeated hit and run raids against Japanese police stations by infiltrating over the Japanese &quot;guardline&quot; of electrified fences and police stations as they pleased.

The 1930 &quot;New Flora and Silva, Volume 2&quot; said of the mountain indigenous that the &quot;majority of them live in a state of war against Japanese authority&quot;. The Bunun and Atayal were described as the &quot;most ferocious&quot; indigenous people, and police stations were targeted by indigenous in intermittent assaults. By January 1915, all indigenous peoples in northern Taiwan were forced to hand over their guns to the Japanese, however head hunting and assaults on police stations by indigenous still continued after that year. Between 1921 and 1929 Aboriginal raids died down, but a major revival and surge in Aboriginal armed resistance erupted from 1930 to 1933 for four years during which the Musha Incident occurred and Bunun carried out raids, after which armed conflict again died down. According to a 1933-year book, wounded people in the Japanese war against the Aboriginals numbered around 4,160, with 4,422 civilians dead and 2,660 military personnel killed. According to a 1935 report, 7,081 Japanese were killed in the armed struggle from 1896 to 1933 while the Japanese confiscated 29,772 indigenous people&#x27;s guns by 1933.

Beginning in the first year of Japanese rule, the colonial government embarked on a mission to study the indigenous so they could be classified, located and &quot;civilized&quot;. The Japanese &quot;civilizing project&quot;, partially fueled by public demand in Japan to know more about the empire, would be used to benefit the Imperial government by consolidating administrative control over the entire island, opening up vast tracts of land for exploitation. To satisfy these needs, &quot;the Japanese portrayed and catalogued Taiwan&#x27;s indigenous peoples in a welter of statistical tables, magazine and newspaper articles, photograph albums for popular consumption&quot;. The Japanese based much of their information and terminology on prior Qing era narratives concerning degrees of &quot;civilization&quot;.

Japanese ethnographer Ino Kanori was charged with the task of surveying the entire population of Taiwanese indigenous, applying the first systematic study of aborigines on Taiwan. Ino&#x27;s research is best known for his formalization of eight peoples of Taiwanese aborigines: Atayal, Bunun, Saisiat, Tsou, Paiwan, Puyuma, Ami and &quot;Pepo&quot; (Pingpu). This is the direct antecedent of the taxonomy used today to distinguish people groups that are officially recognized by the government.

Life under the Japanese changed rapidly as many of the traditional structures were replaced by a military power. Indigenous people who wished to improve their status looked to education rather than headhunting as the new form of power. Those who learned to work with the Japanese and follow their customs would be better suited to lead villages. The Japanese encouraged aborigines to maintain traditional costumes and selected customs that were not considered detrimental to society, but invested much time and money in efforts to eliminate traditions deemed unsavory by Japanese culture, including tattooing. By the mid-1930s as Japan&#x27;s empire was reaching its zenith, the colonial government began a political socialization program designed to enforce Japanese customs, rituals and a loyal Japanese identity upon the aborigines. By the end of World War II, aborigines whose fathers had been killed in pacification campaigns were volunteering to serve in Special Units and if need be die for the Emperor of Japan. The Japanese colonial experience left an indelible mark on many older aborigines who maintained an admiration for the Japanese long after their departure in 1945.

The Japanese troops used indigenous women as sex slaves, so called &quot;comfort women&quot;.

=== Kuomintang single-party rule (1945–1987) ===

Japanese rule of Taiwan ended in 1945, following the armistice with the allies on 2 September and the subsequent appropriation of the island by the Chinese Nationalist Party (Kuomintang, or KMT) on 25 October. In 1949, on losing the Chinese Civil War to the Chinese Communist Party, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek led the Kuomintang in a retreat from mainland China, withdrawing its government and 1.3 million refugees to Taiwan. The KMT installed an authoritarian form of government and shortly thereafter inaugurated a number of political socialization programs aimed at nationalizing Taiwanese people as citizens of a Chinese nation and eradicating Japanese influence.

The KMT pursued highly centralized political and cultural policies rooted in the party&#x27;s decades-long history of fighting warlordism in China and opposing competing concepts of a loose federation following the demise of the imperial Qing. The project was designed to create a strong national Chinese cultural identity (as defined by the state) at the expense of local cultures. Following the February 28 Incident in 1947, the Kuomintang placed Taiwan under martial law, which was to last for nearly four decades.

Taiwanese indigenous peoples first encountered the Nationalist government in 1946, when the Japanese village schools were replaced by schools of the KMT. Documents from the Education Office show an emphasis on Chinese language, history and citizenship—with a curriculum steeped in pro-KMT ideology. Some elements of the curriculum, such as the Wu Feng Legend, are currently considered offensive to the Taiwanese indigenous peoples. Much of the burden of educating the indigenous was undertaken by unqualified teachers, who could, at best, speak Mandarin and teach basic ideology. In 1951 a major political socialization campaign was launched to change the lifestyle of many aborigines, to adopt Han customs. A 1953 government report on mountain areas stated that its aims were chiefly to promote Mandarin to strengthen a national outlook and create good customs. This was included in the Shandi Pingdi Hua (山地平地化) policy to &quot;make the mountains like the plains&quot;.

Critics of the KMT&#x27;s program for a centralized national culture regard it as institutionalized ethnic discrimination, point to the loss of several indigenous languages and a perpetuation of shame for being an aborigine. Hsiau noted that Taiwan&#x27;s first democratically elected president, Li Teng-Hui, said in a famous interview: &quot;In the period of Japanese colonialism a Taiwanese would be punished by being forced to kneel out in the sun for speaking Tai-yü.&quot; [a dialect of Min Nan, which is not a Formosan language].

The pattern of intermarriage continued, as many KMT soldiers married indigenous women who were from poorer areas and could be easily bought as wives. Modern studies show a high degree of genetic intermixing. Despite this, many contemporary Taiwanese are unwilling to entertain the idea of having an indigenous heritage. In a 1994 study, it was found that 71% of the families surveyed would object to their daughter marrying an indigenous man. For much of the KMT era the government definition of indigenous identity had been 100% indigenous parentage, leaving any intermarriage resulting in a non-indigenous child. Later the policy was adjusted to the ethnic status of the father determining the status of the child.

=== Transition to democracy ===

Authoritarian rule under the Kuomintang ended gradually through a transition to democracy, which was marked by the lifting of martial law in 1987. Soon after, the KMT transitioned to being merely one party within a democratic system, though maintaining a high degree of power in indigenous districts through an established system of patronage networks. The KMT continued to hold the reins of power for another decade under President Lee Teng-hui. However, they did so as an elected government rather than a dictatorial power. The elected KMT government supported many of the bills that had been promoted by indigenous groups. The tenth amendment to the Constitution of the Republic of China also stipulates that the government would protect and preserve indigenous culture and languages and also encourage them to participate in politics.

During the period of political liberalization, which preceded the end of martial law, academic interest in the Plains indigenous surged as amateur and professional historians sought to rediscover Taiwan&#x27;s past. The opposition &quot;tang wai&quot; activists seized upon the new image of the Plains indigenous as a means to directly challenge the KMT&#x27;s official narrative of Taiwan as a historical part of China, and the government&#x27;s assertion that Taiwanese were &quot;pure&quot; Han Chinese. Many &quot;tang wai&quot; activists framed the Plains indigenous experience in the existing anti-colonialism/victimization Taiwanese nationalist narrative, which positioned the Hoklo-speaking Taiwanese in the role of indigenous people and the victims of successive foreign rulers.

By the late 1980s many Hoklo- and Hakka-speaking people began identifying themselves as Plains indigenous, though any initial shift in ethnic consciousness from Hakka or Hoklo people was minor.
Despite the politicized dramatization of the Plains indigenous, their &quot;rediscovery&quot; as a matter of public discourse has had a lasting effect on the increased socio-political reconceptualization of Taiwan—emerging from a Han Chinese-dominant perspective into a wider acceptance of Taiwan as a multi-cultural and multi-ethnic community.

In many districts Taiwanese aborigines tend to vote for the Kuomintang, to the point that the legislative seats allocated to the indigenous are popularly described as &quot;iron votes&quot; for the pan-blue coalition. This may seem surprising in light of the focus of the pan-green coalition on promoting aboriginal culture as part of the Taiwanese nationalist discourse against the KMT. However, this voting pattern can be explained on economic grounds, and as part of an inter-ethnic power struggle waged in the electorate. Some aborigines see the rhetoric of Taiwan nationalism as favoring the majority Hoklo speakers rather than themselves. Indigenous areas also tend to be poor and their economic vitality tied to the entrenched patronage networks established by the Kuomintang over the course of its fifty-five year reign.

=== Democratic era ===

The democratic era has been a time of great change, both constructive and destructive, for the indigenous of Taiwan. Since the 1980s, increased political and public attention has been paid to the rights and social issues of the indigenous communities of Taiwan. Indigenous peoples have realized gains in both the political and economic spheres. Though progress is ongoing, there remain a number of still unrealized goals within the framework of the ROC: &quot;although certainly more &#x27;equal&#x27; than they were 20, or even 10, years ago, the indigenous inhabitants in Taiwan still remain on the lowest rungs of the legal and socioeconomic ladders&quot;. On the other hand, bright spots are not hard to find. A resurgence in ethnic pride has accompanied the indigenous cultural renaissance, which is exemplified by the increased popularity of aboriginal music and greater public interest in indigenous culture.

==== Indigenous political movement ====
The movement for indigenous cultural and political resurgence in Taiwan traces its roots to the ideals outlined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948). Although the Republic of China was a UN member and signatory to the original UN Charter, four decades of martial law controlled the discourse of culture and politics on Taiwan. The political liberalization Taiwan experienced leading up to the official end of martial law on 15 July 1987, opened a new public arena for dissenting voices and political movements against the centralized policy of the KMT.

In December 1984, the Taiwan Aboriginal People&#x27;s Movement was launched when a group of indigenous political activists, aided by the progressive Presbyterian Church in Taiwan (PCT), established the Alliance of Taiwan Aborigines (ATA, or &quot;yuan chuan hui&quot;) to highlight the problems experienced by indigenous communities all over Taiwan, including: prostitution, economic disparity, land rights and official discrimination in the form of naming rights.

In 1988, amid the ATA&#x27;s Return Our Land Movement, in which aborigines demanded the return of lands to the original inhabitants, the ATA sent its first representative to the United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Populations. Following the success in addressing the UN, the &quot;Return Our Land&quot; movement evolved into the Aboriginal Constitution Movement, in which the indigenous representatives demanded appropriate wording in the ROC Constitution to ensure indigenous Taiwanese &quot;dignity and justice&quot; in the form of enhanced legal protection, government assistance to improve living standards in indigenous communities, and the right to identify themselves as &quot;&quot;yuan chu min&quot; (原住民), literally, &quot;the people who lived here first,&quot; but more commonly, &quot;aborigines&quot;&quot;. The KMT government initially opposed the term, due to its implication that other people on Taiwan, including the KMT government, were newcomers and not entitled to the island. The KMT preferred &quot;hsien chu min&quot; (先住民, &quot;First people&quot;), or &quot;tsao chu min&quot; (早住民, &quot;Early People&quot;) to evoke a sense of general historical immigration to Taiwan.
To some degree the movement has been successful. Beginning in 1998, the official curriculum in Taiwan schools has been changed to contain more frequent and favorable mention of indigenous. In 1996 the Council of Indigenous Peoples was promoted to a ministry-level rank within the Executive Yuan. The central government has taken steps to allow romanized spellings of aboriginal names on official documents, offsetting the long-held policy of forcing a Han name on an aborigine. A relaxed policy on identification now allows a child to choose their official designation if they are born to mixed indigenous/Han parents.

The present political leaders in the indigenous community, led mostly by indigenous elites born after 1949, have been effective in leveraging their ethnic identity and socio-linguistic acculturation into contemporary Taiwanese society against the political backdrop of a changing Taiwan. This has allowed indigenous people a means to push for greater political space, including the still unrealized prospect of Indigenous People&#x27;s Autonomous Areas within Taiwan.

In February 2017, the Indigenous Ketagalan Boulevard Protest started in a bid for more official recognition of land as traditional territories.

==== Political representation ====
Indigenous peoples were represented by eight members out of 225 seats in the Legislative Yuan. In 2008, the number of legislative seats was cut in half to 113, of which Taiwanese indigenous are represented by six members, three each for lowland and highland peoples. The tendency of Taiwanese aborigines to vote for members of the pan-blue coalition has been cited as having the potential to change the balance of the legislature. Citing these six seats in addition with five seats from smaller counties that also tend to vote pan-blue has been seen as giving the pan-blue coalition 11 seats before the first vote is counted.

The deep-rooted hostility between indigenous and (Taiwanese) Hoklo, and the indigenous communities&#x27; effective KMT networks, contribute to indigenous skepticism against the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the indigenous tendency to vote for the KMT.

Indigenous peoples have criticized politicians for abusing the &quot;indigenization&quot; movement for political gains, such as indigenous opposition to the DPP&#x27;s &quot;rectification&quot; by recognizing the Taroko for political reasons, with the majority of mountain townships voting for Ma Ying-jeou. The Atayal and Seediq slammed the Truku for their name rectification.

In 2005 the Kuomintang displayed a massive photo of the anti-Japanese indigenous leader Mona Rudao at its headquarters in honor of the 60th anniversary of Taiwan&#x27;s handover from Japan to the Republic of China.

Kao Chin Su-mei led indigenous legislators to protest against the Japanese at Yasukuni shrine.

The Taipei Times ran an editorial in 2008 that rejected the idea of an apology to the indigenous, and rejected the idea of comparing Australian Aborigines&#x27; centuries of &#x27;genocidal&#x27; suffering at the hands of White Australians to the suffering of indigenous in Taiwan.

Indigenous peoples protested against the 14th Dalai Lama during his visit to Taiwan after Typhoon Morakot and denounced it as politically motivated.

In 2016, indigenous protestors criticized Tsai for not returning to Chen Shui-bian&#x27;s New Partnership quasi-state relationship which she did not mention in her apology to the indigenous. The location of the apology, the Japanese colonial administration&#x27;s governor-general, as well as the indigenous invited to the apology, who only counted officials rather than traditional leaders, were was also criticized. Aboriginal Transitional Justice Alliance president Kumu Hacyo described the apology as &quot;a political show that was put on in an extremely bureaucratic fashion&quot; lacking in sincerity and evasive in nature. In response to the &quot;apology&quot; ceremony held by Tsai, KMT Aboriginal lawmakers refused to attend. Indigenous peoples demanded that recompense from Tsai to accompany the apology.

The derogatory term &quot;fan&quot; (Chinese: ) was often used against the Plains indigenous by the Taiwanese. The Hoklo Taiwanese term was forced upon indigenous like the Pazeh. In November 2016, a racist anti-indigenous slur was also used by Chiu Yi-ying, a DPP Taiwanese legislator, who said that the term meant &quot;&#x27;unreasonable people&quot; and was meant to describe the actions of KMT lawmakers. KMT caucus whip Sufin Siluko accused Chiu of directing the term at himself and another indigenous KMT legislator.

According to Mr. Lupiliyan, a Paiwan man who has participated in exchange activities sponsored by the government, the current government is still a colonial establishment and is &quot;using the colonized to protect its international position&quot;. However he believes that the main beneficiaries are still the Taiwanese indigenous people. Lupiliyan says that Austronesian diplomacy and international exchanges provide them with templates on how to revitalize their own culture.

Due to these reasons, the anthropologist Scott Simon argues that the current political climate amongst indigenous people highlights a &quot;paradox of indigeneity&quot;. Simon explains that despite the DPP&#x27;s strong support of indigenous discourse and apologies to indigenous communities, Taiwanese Indigenous peoples despite being indigenous people themselves, tend to remain quite skeptical and continue to be more inclined to vote for the KMT, a political party that has largely rejected and resisted the popularization of indigenous discourse.

=====Right to hunt=====
Hunting is a traditional way of life with cultural and religious significance to the indigenous Taiwanese, but the practice has been strictly regulated by the ROC government in the name of gun control and wildlife conservation. A Bunun hunter was arrested in 2013 for hunting protected animals with an illegally modified shotgun, and convicted in 2015, prompting political discourse over the indigenous right to hunt, conservation, and gun control. In 2021 the constitutional court ruled that the government has the right to regulate guns and the hunting of wildlife even in the context of indigenous hunting, but the regulations should be updated to accommodate the need of indigenous hunting. The indigenous community mostly disagreed with the ruling made only by Han Chinese judges. The Bunun hunter eventually received a presidential pardon, but the law is still not updated.

====Economic issues====
Many indigenous communities did not evenly share in the benefits of the economic boom Taiwan experienced during the last quarter of the 20th century. They often lacked satisfactory educational resources on their reservations, undermining their pursuit of marketable skills. The economic disparity between the village and urban schools resulted in imposing many social barriers on indigenous, which prevent many from moving beyond vocational training. Students transplanted into urban schools face adversity, including isolation, culture shock, and discrimination from their peers. The cultural impact of poverty and economic marginalization has led to an increase in alcoholism and prostitution among indigenous.

The economic boom resulted in drawing large numbers of indigenous peoples out of their villages and into the unskilled or low-skilled sector of the urban workforce. Manufacturing and construction jobs were generally available for low wages. The aborigines quickly formed bonds with other communities as they all had similar political motives to protect their collective needs as part of the labor force. The indigenous became the most skilled iron-workers and construction teams on the island often selected to work on the most difficult projects. The result was a mass exodus of indigenous members from their traditional lands and the cultural alienation of young people in the villages, who could not learn their languages or customs while employed. Often, young aborigines in the cities fall into gangs aligned with the construction trade. Recent laws governing the employment of laborers from Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines have also led to an increased atmosphere of xenophobia among urban indigenous, and encouraged the formulation of a pan-indigenous consciousness in the pursuit of political representation and protection.

==== Ecological issues ====
The indigenous communities of Taiwan are closely linked with ecological awareness and conservation issues on the island, as many of the environmental issues are spearheaded by aborigines. Political activism and sizable public protests regarding the logging of the Chilan Formosan Cypress, as well as efforts by an Atayal member of the Legislative Yuan, &quot;focused debate on natural resource management and specifically on the involvement of aboriginal people therein&quot;. Another high-profile case is the nuclear waste storage facility on Orchid Island, a small tropical island off the southeast coast of Taiwan. The inhabitants are the 4,000 members of the Tao (or Yami). In the 1970s the island was designated as a possible site to store low and medium grade nuclear waste. The island was selected on the grounds that it would be cheaper to build the necessary infrastructure for storage and it was thought that the population would not cause trouble.

Large-scale construction began in 1978 on a site from the Immorod fishing fields. The Tao alleges that government sources at the time described the site as a &quot;factory&quot; or a &quot;fish cannery&quot;, intended to bring &quot;jobs [to the] home of the Tao/Yami, one of the least economically integrated areas in Taiwan&quot;. When the facility was completed in 1982, however, it was in fact a storage facility for &quot;97,000 barrels of low-radiation nuclear waste from Taiwan&#x27;s three nuclear power plants&quot;. The Tao have since stood at the forefront of the anti-nuclear movement and launched several exorcisms and protests to remove the waste they claim has resulted in deaths and sickness. The lease on the land has expired, and an alternative site has yet to be selected.

The competition between different ways of representing and interpreting indigenous culture among local tourism operators does exist and creates tensions between indigenous tour guides and the NGOs which help to design and promote ethno/ecotourism. E.g., in a Sioulin Township, the government sponsored a project &quot;Follow the Footsteps of Indigenous Hunters&quot;. Academics and members from environmental NGOs have suggested a new way of hunting: to replace shotgun with camera. Hunters benefit from the satisfaction of ecotourists who may spot wild animals under the instructions of accompanied indigenous hunters [Chen, 2012]. The rarer the animals are witnessed by tourists, the higher the pay will be to the hunters.

==== Military ====
Taiwanese indigenous people make up a greater percentage of the Republic of China Armed Forces than their percentage of the overall Taiwanese population, making up 8.7 percent of military personnel as of 2024. Taiwanese indigenous people are especially critical to elite military units where they constitute over half of the personnel in some units.

==Culture==
===Religion===

Of the current population of Taiwanese indigenous, about 70% identify themselves as Christian. Many of the Plains groups have mobilized their members around Christian organizations; most notably the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan and Catholicism.

Before contact with Christian missionaries during both the Dutch and Qing periods, Taiwanese indigenous peoples held a variety of beliefs in spirits, gods, sacred symbols and myths that helped their societies find meaning and order. Although there is no evidence of a unified belief system shared among the various indigenous groups, there is evidence that several groups held supernatural beliefs in certain birds and bird behavior. The Siraya were reported by Dutch sources to incorporate bird imagery into their material culture. Other reports describe animal skulls and the use of human heads in societal beliefs. The Paiwan and other southern groups worship the Formosan hundred pacer snake and use the diamond patterns on its back in many designs. In many Plains Aborigines societies, the power to communicate with the supernatural world was exclusively held by women called &quot;Inibs&quot;. During the period of Dutch colonization, the &quot;Inibs&quot; were removed from the villages to eliminate their influence and pave the way for Dutch missionary work.

During the Zheng and Qing eras, Han immigrants brought Confucianized beliefs of Taoism and Buddhism to Taiwan&#x27;s indigenous people. Many Plains indigenous adopted Han religious practices, though there is evidence that many indigenous customs were transformed into local Taiwanese Han beliefs. In some parts of Taiwan the Siraya spirit of fertility, Ali-zu (A-li-tsu) has become assimilated into the Han pantheon. The use of female spirit mediums (&quot;tongji&quot;) can also be traced to the earlier matrilineal &quot;Inibs&quot;.

Although many aborigines assumed Han religious practices, several sub-groups sought protection from the European missionaries, who had started arriving in the 1860s. Many of the early Christian converts were displaced groups of Plains indigenous that sought protection from the oppressive Han. The missionaries, under the articles of extraterritoriality, offered a form of power against the Qing establishment and could thus make demands on the government to provide redress for the complaints of Plains indigenous. Many of these early congregations have served to maintain aboriginal identity, language and cultures.

The influence of 19th- and 20th-century missionaries has both transformed and maintained aboriginal integration. Many of the churches have replaced earlier community functions, but continue to retain a sense of continuity and community that unites members of aboriginal societies against the pressures of modernity. Several church leaders have emerged from within the communities to take on leadership positions in petitioning the government in the interest of indigenous peoples and seeking a balance between the interests of the communities and economic vitality.

===Music===
A full-time indigenous radio station, &quot;Ho-hi-yan&quot;, was launched in 2005 with the help of the Executive Yuan, to focus on issues of interest to the indigenous community. This came on the heels of a &quot;New wave of Indigenous Pop&quot;, as aboriginal artists, such as A-mei, Pur-dur and Samingad (Puyuma), Difang, A-Lin (Amis), Princess Ai 戴愛玲 (Paiwan), and Landy Wen (Atayal) became international pop-stars. The rock musician Chang Chen-yue is a member of the Ami. Music has given indigenous both a sense of pride and a sense of cultural ownership.

The issue of ownership was exemplified when the musical project Enigma used an Ami chant in their song &quot;Return to Innocence&quot;, which was selected as the official theme of the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. The main chorus was sung by Difang and his wife, Igay. The Amis couple successfully sued Enigma&#x27;s record label, which then paid royalties to the French museum that held the master recordings of the traditional songs, but the original artists, who had been unaware of the Enigma project, remained uncompensated.

===Parks, tourism, and commercialization===

Indigenous groups are seeking to preserve their folkways and languages as well as to return to, or remain on, their traditional lands. Eco-tourism, sewing and selling carvings, jewellery and music have become viable areas of economic opportunity. However, tourism-based commercial development, such as the creation of Taiwan Aboriginal Culture Park, is not a panacea. Although these create new jobs, aborigines are seldom given management positions. Moreover, some national parks have been built on indigenous lands against the wishes of the local communities, prompting one Taroko activist to label the Taroko National Park as a form of environmental colonialism. At times, the creation of national parks has resulted in forced resettlement of the aborigines.

Due to the close proximity of indigenous land to the mountains, many communities have hoped to cash in on hot spring ventures and hotels, where they offer singing and dancing to add to the ambience. The Wulai Atayal in particular have been active in this area. Considerable government funding has been allocated to museums and culture centers focusing on Taiwan&#x27;s aboriginal heritage. Critics often call the ventures exploitative and &quot;superficial portrayals&quot; of aboriginal culture, which distract attention from the real problems of substandard education. Proponents of ethno-tourism suggest that such projects can positively impact the public image and economic prospects of the indigenous community.

The attractive tourist destination includes natural resources, infrastructure, customs and culture, as well as the characteristics of the local industry. Thus, the role of the local community in influencing the tourism development activities is clear. The essence of tourism in today&#x27;s world is the development and delivery of travel and visitation experiences to a range of individuals and groups who wish to see, understand, and experience the nature of different destinations and the way people live, work, and enjoy life in those destinations. The attitude of local people towards tourists constitutes one of the elements of a destination&#x27;s tourism value chain.
The attraction is a tourist area&#x27;s experience theme, however the main appeal is the formation of the fundamentals of the tourism image in the region [Kao, 1995]. Attraction sources can be diverse, including the area&#x27;s natural resources, economic activities, customs, development history, religion, outdoor recreation activities, events and other related resources. This way, the awareness of indigenous resources constitutes an attraction to tourists. The aboriginal culture is an important indicator of tourism products&#x27; attractiveness and a new type of economic sources.

While there is an important need to link the economic, cultural, and ecological imperatives of development in the context of tourism enterprises, there is the key question of implementation and how the idea of sustainable tourism enterprises can be translated into reality: formulation of strategies and how they may be expected to interact with important aspects of indigenous culture. In addition to being locally directed and relevant, the planning process for the establishment of an ethno/ecotourism enterprise in an indigenous community should be strategic in nature. The use of a strategic planning process enables indigenous culture to be regarded as an important characteristic requiring careful consideration, rather than a feature to be exploited, or an incidental characteristic that is overshadowed by the natural features of the environment.

====Pulima Art Festival====

The Pulima Art Festival (藝術節; also known as Pulima Arts Festival) is a biennial event held since 2012 which showcases indigenous art and culture and is the biggest indigenous contemporary art event in Taiwan. &quot;Pulima&quot; is a Paiwan word meaning &quot;creative or highly skilled people&quot;. Inspired by the Edinburgh Art Festival and the Festival d&#x27;Avignon in France, Pulima is supported by the Indigenous Peoples Cultural Foundation. Dancers and musicians from Taiwan as well as abroad feature in the festival, which takes place between November and February every second year, and awards a prize called the Pulima Art Prize.

The festival was held in Taipei in 2012 and 2014, and in Kaohsiung in 2016. In 2016, the Atamira Dance Company and Black Grace came from New Zealand, and B2M (Bathurst to Melville), a band from the Tiwi Islands, Australia also performed at the festival.

The 2018 festival took place in the Museum of Contemporary Art Taipei Under the theme &quot;MICAWOR – Turning Over&quot;, it displayed the talents of 26 groups of Taiwanese and international artists, and included a series of international forums, artist lectures, workshops and many other events. It collaborated with Melbourne&#x27;s YIRRAMBOI Festival, with a &quot;Festival in Festival&quot; program.

The Pulima Arts Festival took place from 2020 to 2021 and several videos of participants are available on YouTube.

=== Indigenous Peoples&#x27; Day ===

In 2016, the administration under President Tsai Ing-wen approved a proposal that designated 1 August as Indigenous Peoples&#x27; Day in Taiwan. In celebration of the special day, President Tsai issued an official apology to the country&#x27;s indigenous people and outlined steps to further promote legislation and involve organizations related to indigenous causes, such as the Presidential Office&#x27;s Indigenous Historical Justice and Transitional Justice Committee. The government hopes the day will remind the public of the diverse ethnic groups in Taiwan by bringing greater respect for indigenous peoples&#x27; cultures and history and promoting their rights.

==Genetics==
A 2021 study shows strong genetic affinities between Ami and Yami and the Igorots of Philippines. The Ami and Yami also share IBD segments with the East Polynesians of Society Archipelago, which are relatively long on average. The latter can be explained as a result of these groups settling uninhabited islands instead of previously populated regions.

A 2021 study detected 77% Austronesian-related ancestral components in the Ami and Atayal, with 21% and 18% Sino-Tibetan-related ancestral components being found in both groups respectively. Taiwanese Han also have 15% Islander Southeast Asian ancestry, which can be attributed to admixture with Austronesian populations although it is more likely that this admixture occurred before Taiwanese Han migrated to Taiwan.

A 2022 study states that Ami and Atayal derive their ancestries from a Late Neolithic Fujianese source (66.9–74.3%).

A 2023 study states that ~1.5 kya Hanben individuals were more genetically related to Atayal whilst the ~7.7 kya Liangdao and ~4.5 kya Suogang individuals were slightly closer to the southern group Rukai. Atayal excessively share alleles with mainland southern East Asian groups, both ancient and modern, whilst Amis and Rukai share alleles with islander Southeast Asian and Oceanic groups, both ancient and modern. Atayal also have their distinctive haplotype network, suggesting founder/isolation events. Into-Taiwan groups, which Atayal are the most related to, possessed low Northeast Asian ancestry (~0–8%) in contrast to modern Taiwanese Highland and Orchid groups (~28–37%).

===Claimed admixture with Taiwanese Han===
A study by in 2007 reported that the human leukocyte antigen typing study and mitochondrial DNA analysis demonstrated that 85% of the Taiwanese Han population had some degree of indigenous origin. Other studies by Chen Shun-Shen state that 20% to 60%, and then more than 88% of Taiwanese Han have indigenous blood. These studies were criticized by other researchers and refuted by subsequent genetic studies. However the idea that Taiwanese Han are a hybrid population genetically different from Chinese Han has been used as a basis for Taiwanese independence from China. This belief has been called the &quot;myth of indigenous genes&quot; by some researchers such as Shu-juo Chen and Hong-kuan Duan, who say that &quot;genetic studies have never supported the idea that Taiwanese Han are genetically different with Chinese Han.&quot;

The idea that &quot;We are all indigenous people&quot; was initially welcomed by indigenous leaders but has faced increasing opposition as it became viewed as a tool for Taiwanese independence. On 9 August 2005, a celebration for the constitutional reforms protecting indigenous rights was held, during which Premier Frank Hsieh announced that he had an indigenous great-grandmother and that &quot;Now you shouldn&#x27;t say: &#x27;you are indigenous, I am not.&#x27; Everyone is indigenous.&quot; Descendants of plains indigenous have opposed the usage of their ancestors in the call for Taiwanese independence. Genetic studies show genetic differences between Taiwanese Han and mountain indigenous. According to Chen and Duan, the genetic ancestry of individuals cannot be traced with certainty and attempts to construct identity through genetics are &quot;theoretically meaningless&quot;.

The Plains &quot;Pingpu&quot; indigenous of Taiwan criticized Lin&#x27;s studies, which follows the &quot;blood line theory&quot; of Taiwanese nationalism. Alak Akatuang, secretary of the Pingpu Indigenous Peoples Cultural Association, said that the pan-green camp used the indigenous peoples to create a national identity for Taiwan, but the idea that Taiwanese people are not overwhelmingly descended from Han settlers is false. According to Akatuang, Taiwan&#x27;s independence should not be founded on the idea of genetic lineages and these people who believe in the blood line theory &quot;ignore scientific evidence because they want to believe they are different from China.&quot; This harmed the legitimacy of the Pingpu movement for recognition and reparations and was deeply insulting: &quot;The Pingpu were the first of Taiwan&#x27;s Indigenous peoples to face colonization. After the Han people came, they stole our land. They murdered our ancestors. Then after a few hundred years, they said we were the same people. Do you think a Pingpu person can accept this?&quot;

In the highest self reports, 5.3 percent of Taiwan&#x27;s population claimed indigenous heritage. Estimates of genetic indigenous ancestry reported by Lin range from 13%, 26%, and as high as 85%, the latter number being published in an editorial that was not peer-reviewed. These numbers have taken hold in popular Taiwanese imagination and sometimes treated as facts in Taiwanese politics and identity. Many Taiwanese claim to be part indigenous. Chen suggests that the estimates resulted from manipulation of sample sizes. The lack of methodological rigor suggests the numbers were meant for local consumption. In all other scientific studies, genetic markers for indigenous ancestry make up a minute portion of the genome. In 2021, Marie Lin, who was the source of the larger indigenous ancestry numbers, co-authored an article stating that there are &quot;distinct patterns of genetic structure between the Taiwanese Han and indigenous populations.&quot; The paper also suggest East Asian ancestry may have mixed with indigenous peoples in their southward expansion 4,000 years ago, which can lead to data that may be misinterpreted as recent Taiwanese Han-indigenous admixtures.

<text>A feed horn (or feedhorn) is a small horn antenna used to couple a waveguide to e.g. a parabolic dish antenna or offset dish antenna for reception or transmission of microwaves. A typical application is the use for satellite television reception with a satellite dish. In that case the feed horn can either be a separate part used together with e.g. a &quot;low-noise block downconverter&quot; (LNB), or more typically today is integrated into a &quot;low-noise block feedhorn&quot; (LNBF).

==Principle of operation==
The feed horn minimizes the mismatch loss between the antenna and the waveguide. If a simple open-ended waveguide would be used, without the horn, the sudden end of the conductive walls causes an abrupt impedance change at the aperture, between the wave impedance in the waveguide and the impedance of free space (see horn antenna for more details).

When used with a offset, parabolic or lens antenna, the phase center of the horn is placed at the focal point of the reflector. The characteristic of the feed horn is usually selected with the of the horn&#x27;s radiation pattern falling on the edge of the reflector (the beamwidth of the horn matching the F/D ratio of the dish). When the shape of the antenna deviates from a circular dish, the feedhorn needs to be shaped accordingly to illuminate the antenna properly.

==Applications==
For satellite TV reception the feedhorn is mounted at the feed arm of the satellite dish. The feedhorn then connects via a short waveguide to the &quot;low-noise block downconverter&quot; (LNB), a small housing containing a part of the reception electronics (also called the &quot;RF front end&quot;). This LNB converts the high satellite microwave downlink frequencies to lower frequencies, so the TV signals can be more easily transmitted through coaxial cables to receivers located anywhere inside a building. For DTH TV typically the LNB and the feedhorn are integrated into one unit called &quot;low-noise block feedhorn&quot; (LNBF), but separate feedhorns and LNBs are used for more specialized applications.

For satellite uplink (e.g. for transmission of &quot;Direct-To-Home&quot; DTH TV programs, satellite news gathering SNG, satellite internet access or VSAT applications) a block upconverter (BUC) connects via a waveguide to the feedhorn, in order to transmit via the satellite dish to the communications satellite.

Feedhorns are also used in applications like radar, line-of-sight microwave transmission or radio astronomy.

<text>TacTix is a two-player strategy game invented by Piet Hein, a poet well known for dabbling in math and science, best known for his game Hex.

TacTix is essentially a two-dimension version of Nim; players alternate moves, removing one or more tokens in a single row or column until the last one is removed. At the time of its founding, TacTix was played on a 6x6 board, but is now usually played on a 4x4 board. 

The game can be played in both its misere and non-misere forms. The strategies outlined here make the non-misere variant of the game straightforward. The game is often used as a programming exercise, and many versions are available on the web as Java applets.

==Game play==
TacTix is played on a NxN grid of squares, where N was initially 6, but has more commonly been played as 4.

Players alternate removing pieces a selected row or column, as many contiguous pieces as desired. For instance, in a 6x6 game, a player might remove pieces one through four on the first row. They cannot remove only the first and third pieces, these are not contiguous.

Players alternate doing this until the last piece is removed. The player who takes the last piece &quot;loses&quot; in the misère play convention, or wins in the non-misère version.

==Strategy==
First Player If N Is Odd (non-misere): The player takes the center piece and symmetrically imitates every one of the opponent&#x27;s moves.

Second Player If N Is Even (non-misere): Player copies opponent&#x27;s moves symmetrically. You will eventually take the last piece and win.

==Variations==
The hexagonal variation of the game, played on a six by six by six board, is called TacTex. TacTix can also be played on any size NxN board. A Non Misere version of TacTix, where the player who makes the last move is the winner, is also playable.

==Analysis==
On the 4×4 grid originally proposed by Hein, the second player will always win with correct play (HAKMEM item #74).

If the game is instead played with the normal play convention (player who takes the last piece wins), the second player can always win by symmetrically mirroring the first player&#x27;s moves. (Or on an &quot;odd&quot; × &quot;odd&quot; size grid, the first player can win by choosing the center piece and subsequently mirroring.)

Tac Tix has 65,536 reachable positions. Out of the reachable positions, 57,156 are winning, and 8,380 are losing

<doc id="53813" wikidata="Q336424" url="?curid=53813" title="Ub Iwerks">
<text>Ubbe Ert Iwerks (March 24, 1901 – July 7, 1971), known as Ub Iwerks ( ), was an American animator, cartoonist, character designer, inventor, and special effects technician, known for his work with Walt Disney Animation Studios in general, and for having worked on the development of the design of the character of Mickey Mouse, among others. Born in Kansas City, Missouri, Iwerks met fellow artist Walt Disney while working at a Kansas City art studio in 1919. 

After briefly working as illustrators for a local newspaper company, Disney and Iwerks ventured into animation together. Iwerks joined Disney as chief animator on the Laugh-O-Gram shorts series beginning in 1922, but a studio bankruptcy would cause Disney to relocate to Los Angeles in 1923. In the new studio, Iwerks continued to work with Disney on the &quot;Alice Comedies&quot; as well as the creation of the Oswald the Lucky Rabbit character. Following the first &quot;Oswald&quot; short, both Universal Pictures and the Winkler Pictures production company insisted that the Oswald character be redesigned. At the insistence of Disney, Iwerks designed a number of new characters for the studio, including designs that would be used for Clarabelle Cow and Horace Horsecollar.

One of Iwerks&#x27; most long-lasting contributions to animation was a refined version of a sketch drawn by Disney that would later go on to become Mickey Mouse. Iwerks was responsible for much of the animation for the early Mickey Mouse and &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; cartoons, including &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot;, &quot;The Skeleton Dance&quot; and &quot;The Haunted House&quot;, before a falling out with Disney led to Iwerks&#x27; resignation from the studio in January 1930. Iwerks&#x27; final &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; cartoon was 1930&#x27;s &quot;The Cactus Kid&quot;. Following his separation with Disney, Iwerks, operating under Iwerks Studio, created the characters Flip the Frog and Willie Whopper along with the &quot;ComiColor Cartoons&quot; series as part of a contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, but the new studio failed to rival its competitors. Iwerks later directed two &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; cartoon shorts for Leon Schlesinger Productions and several &quot;Color Rhapsody&quot; cartoons for Screen Gems before joining Disney again in 1940, after which he worked with special visual effects on productions such as 1946&#x27;s &quot;Song of the South&quot;.

Iwerks had two children, Donald Warren Iwerks and David Lee Iwerks, with his wife Mildred Sarah Henderson. Iwerks died of a heart attack in Burbank, California, in 1971 at age 70. Iwerks was posthumously named a Disney Legend in 1989. His likeness has been featured in his granddaughter Leslie Iwerks&#x27; 1999 documentary &quot;The Hand Behind the Mouse: The Ub Iwerks Story&quot; as well as the 2014 feature film &quot;Walt Before Mickey&quot;, in which he is portrayed by Armando Gutierrez. Iwerks received three nominations at the Academy Awards, for which he won one. He also posthumously received the Winsor McCay Award at the 1978 Annie Awards and the Hall of Fame award at the 2017 Visual Effects Society Awards.

== Early life ==
Iwerks was born in Kansas City, Missouri. His father was born in the village of Uttum in East Frisia (northwest Germany, today part of the municipality of Krummhörn) and emigrated to the United States in 1869 around the age of 14. The elder Iwerks, who worked as a barber, had fathered and abandoned several previous children and wives. When Ub was a teenager, his father abandoned him as well, forcing the boy to drop out of school and work to support his mother. Iwerks despised his father and never spoke of him; upon learning that he had died, he reportedly said, &quot;Throw him in a ditch.&quot; He attended Ashland Grammar School, graduating in 1914. Ub&#x27;s full name, Ubbe Ert Iwwerks, can be seen on early &quot;Alice Comedies&quot; that he signed. Several years later, he simplified his name to &quot;Ub Iwerks&quot;, sometimes written as &quot;U.B. Iwerks&quot;.

==Career==
===Disney work (1919–1929)===
Iwerks spent most of his career with Disney. The two met in 1919 while working for the Pesmen-Rubin Art Studio in Kansas City, and eventually started their own commercial art business together. Disney and Iwerks then found work as illustrators for the Kansas City Slide Newspaper Company (which was later named The Kansas City Film Ad Company). While working for the Kansas City Film Ad Company, Disney decided to take up work in animation, and Iwerks soon joined him. There he attached a motor drive to the camera with a switch that resembled a telegraph key, reducing the number of people needed to animate from two to just one.

Iwerks was responsible for the distinctive style of the earliest Disney animated cartoons, and was also responsible for designing Mickey Mouse. In 1922, when Disney began his Laugh-O-Gram cartoon series, Iwerks joined him as chief animator. The studio went bankrupt, however, and in 1923 Iwerks followed Disney&#x27;s move to Los Angeles to work on a new series of cartoons known as &quot;the Alice Comedies&quot; which had live-action mixed with animation. After the end of this series, Disney asked Iwerks to design a character that became Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. The first cartoon Oswald starred in was animated entirely by Iwerks. Following the first cartoon, Oswald was redesigned on the insistence of Oswald&#x27;s owner and the distributor of the cartoons, Universal Pictures. The production company at the time, Winkler Pictures, gave additional input on the character&#x27;s design.

In spring 1928, Disney was removed from the Oswald series, and much of his staff was hired away to Winkler Pictures. He promised to never again work with a character he did not own. Disney asked Iwerks, who stayed on, to start drawing up new character ideas. Iwerks tried sketches of frogs, dogs, and cats, but none of these appealed to Disney. A female cow and male horse were created at this time by Iwerks, but were also rejected. They later turned up as Clarabelle Cow and Horace Horsecollar. Ub Iwerks eventually got inspiration from an old drawing. In 1925, Hugh Harman drew some sketches of mice around a photograph of Walt Disney. Then, on a train ride back from a failed business meeting, Walt Disney came up with the original sketch for the character that was eventually called Mickey Mouse. Afterward, Disney took the sketch to Iwerks. In turn, he drew a more clean-cut and refined version of Mickey, but one that still followed the original sketch.

The first few Mickey Mouse and &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; cartoons were animated almost entirely by Iwerks, including &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot;, &quot;The Skeleton Dance&quot; and &quot;The Haunted House&quot;. However, as Iwerks began to animate more and more cartoons on a daily basis, he chafed under Disney&#x27;s leadership. Iwerks also felt he was not getting the credit he deserved for drawing all of Disney&#x27;s successful cartoons. Eventually, Iwerks and Disney had a falling out; their friendship and working partnership were severed in January 1930. According to an unconfirmed account, a child approached Disney and Iwerks at a party and asked for a picture of Mickey to be drawn on a napkin, to which Disney handed the pen and paper to Iwerks and stated, &quot;Why don&#x27;t you draw Mickey and I&#x27;ll sign it.&quot; Iwerks became furious and threw the pen and paper, storming out. Iwerks accepted a contract with Disney&#x27;s former distributor, Pat Powers to leave Disney and start an animation studio under his own name. His last Mickey Mouse cartoon was &quot;Wild Waves&quot; (1929) and final Disney film was the Silly Symphony &quot;Autumn&quot; (1930). (Powers and Disney had an earlier falling-out over Disney&#x27;s use of the Powers Cinephone sound-on-film system—actually copied by Powers from DeForest Phonofilm without credit—in early Disney cartoons.)

=== After Disney (1930–1940) ===

The Iwerks Studio opened in 1930. Financial backers led by Pat Powers suspected that Iwerks was responsible for much of Disney&#x27;s early success. However, while animation for a time suffered at Disney from Iwerks&#x27; departure, it soon rebounded as Disney brought in talented new young animators.

Despite a contract with MGM to distribute his cartoons, and the introduction of a new character named Flip the Frog and later Willie Whopper, the Iwerks Studio was never a major commercial success and failed to rival either Disney or Fleischer Studios. Newly hired animator Fred Kopietz recommended that Iwerks employ a friend from Chouinard Art School, Chuck Jones, who was hired and put to work as a cel washer. The Flip and Willie cartoons were later distributed on the home-movie market by Official Films in the 1940s.
From 1933 to 1936, he produced a series of shorts (independently distributed, not part of the MGM deal) in Cinecolor, named &quot;ComiColor Cartoons&quot;. The ComiColor series mostly focused on fairy tales with no continuing character or star. Later in the 1940s, this series received home-movie distribution by Castle Films. Cinecolor produced the 16 mm prints for Castle Films with red emulsion on one side and blue emulsion on the other. Later in the 1970s Blackhawk Films released these for home use, but this time using conventional Eastmancolor film stock. They are now in the public domain and are available on VHS and DVD. He also experimented with stop-motion animation in combination with the multiplane camera, and made a short called &quot;The Toy Parade&quot;, which was never released in public. In 1936, backers withdrew financial support from the Iwerks Studio, and it folded soon after.

In 1937, Leon Schlesinger Productions contracted Iwerks to produce four &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; shorts starring Porky Pig and Gabby Goat. Iwerks directed the first two shorts, while former Schlesinger animator Robert Clampett was promoted to director and helmed the other two shorts before he and his unit returned to the main Schlesinger lot. Iwerks then did contract work for Screen Gems (then Columbia Pictures&#x27; cartoon division) where he was the director of several of the &quot;Color Rhapsody&quot; shorts before returning to work for Disney in 1940.

=== Return to Disney (1940–1964) ===
After his return to the Disney studio, Iwerks mainly worked on developing special visual effects. He is credited as developing the processes for combining live-action and animation used in &quot;Song of the South&quot; (1946), as well as the xerographic process adapted for cel animation, which was used in &quot;101 Dalmatians&quot; (1961). He also worked at WED Enterprises, now Walt Disney Imagineering, helping to develop many Disney theme park attractions during the 1960s. Iwerks did special effects work outside the studio as well, including the birds for his Academy Award nominated achievement for Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;The Birds&quot; (1963). Iwerks&#x27; last credit for Disney was for perfecting the travel matte system for the &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; sequence &quot;Feed the Birds&quot; Iwerks&#x27; most famous work, outside animating Mickey Mouse, was Flip the Frog from his own studio. While he was at Disney, he developed a variety of patents for applying Xerography for use in animation.

== Personal life ==
Iwerks had two children with his wife, Mildred (née Henderson): Donald and David. Donald went on to work for the Walt Disney company and to found Iwerks Entertainment. His granddaughter is documentary film producer Leslie Iwerks. David Iwerks became a portrait photographer.

Iwerks died in 1971 from a heart attack in Burbank, California, aged 70, and his ashes are interred in a niche in the Columbarium of Remembrance at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Hollywood Hills Cemetery. The last project he worked on was the Hall of Presidents.

== Influence and tributes ==
The &quot;Ub Iwerks Award for Technical Achievement&quot;, as part of the Annie Awards, is named in his honour.

A rare self-portrait of Iwerks was found in the garbage bin at an animation studio in Burbank. The portrait was saved and is now part of the Animation Archives in Burbank, California.

After World War II, much of Iwerks&#x27; early animation style was imitated by legendary manga artists Osamu Tezuka and Shotaro Ishinomori.

In 1989, Iwerks was named a Disney legend.

In the 1996 &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;The Day the Violence Died&quot;, a relationship similar to Iwerks&#x27; early relationship with Walt Disney is used as the main plot.

A documentary film, &quot;The Hand Behind the Mouse: The Ub Iwerks Story&quot;, was released in 1999, followed by a book written by Iwerks&#x27; granddaughter Leslie Iwerks and John Kenworthy in 2001. The documentary, created by Leslie Iwerks, was released as part of The Walt Disney Treasures, Wave VII series (disc two of The Adventures of Oswald the Lucky Rabbit collection).

A feature film released in 2014, &quot;Walt Before Mickey&quot;, showed how Ub Iwerks, portrayed by Armando Gutierrez, and Walt Disney, portrayed by Thomas Ian Nicholas, co-created Mickey Mouse.

The sixth episode from the second season of &quot;Drunk History&quot; (&quot;Hollywood&quot;) tells about Ub&#x27;s work relationship with Disney, with stress on the creation of Mickey Mouse. Iwerks was portrayed in the episode by Tony Hale.

<text>A Dictionary of the English Language, sometimes published as Johnson&#x27;s Dictionary, was published on 15 April 1755 and written by Samuel Johnson. It is among the most influential dictionaries in the history of the English language.

There was dissatisfaction with the dictionaries of the period, so in June 1746 a group of London booksellers contracted Johnson to write a dictionary for the sum of 1,500 guineas (£1,575), equivalent to about £ in 2025. Johnson took seven years to complete the work, although he had claimed he could finish it in three. He did so single-handedly, with only clerical assistance to copy the illustrative quotations that he had marked in books. Johnson produced several revised editions during his life.

Until the completion of the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; 173 years later, Johnson&#x27;s was viewed as the pre-eminent English dictionary. According to Walter Jackson Bate, the Dictionary &quot;easily ranks as one of the greatest single achievements of scholarship, and probably the greatest ever performed by one individual who laboured under anything like the disadvantages in a comparable length of time&quot;.

== Background ==
In earlier times, books had been regarded with something approaching veneration, but by the mid-eighteenth century this was no longer the case. The rise of literacy among the general public, combined with the technical advances in the mechanics of printing and bookbinding, meant that for the first time, books, texts, maps, pamphlets and newspapers were widely available to the general public at a reasonable cost. Such an explosion of the printed word demanded a set pattern of grammar, definition, and spelling for those words. This could be achieved by means of an authoritative dictionary of the English language. In 1746, a consortium of London&#x27;s most successful printers, including Robert Dodsley and Thomas Longman – none could afford to undertake it alone – set out to satisfy and capitalise on this need by the ever-increasing reading and writing public.

Johnson&#x27;s dictionary was not the first English dictionary, nor even among the first dozen. Over the previous 150 years more than twenty dictionaries had been published in England, the oldest of these being a Latin-English &quot;wordbook&quot; by Sir Thomas Elyot published in 1538.

The next to appear was by Richard Mulcaster, a headmaster, in 1583. Mulcaster compiled what he termed &quot;a generall table [of eight thousand words] we commonlie use...[yet] It were a thing verie praise worthy...if som well learned...would gather all words which we use in the English tung...into one dictionary...&quot; In 1598, an Italian–English dictionary by John Florio was published. It was the first English dictionary to use quotations (&quot;illustrations&quot;) to give meaning to the word; in none of these dictionaries so far were there any actual definitions of words. This was to change, to a small extent, in schoolmaster Robert Cawdrey&#x27;s &quot;Table Alphabeticall&quot;, published in 1604. Though it contained only 2,449 words, and no word beginning with the letters &quot;W&quot;, &quot;X&quot;, or &quot;Y&quot;, this was the first monolingual English dictionary. Several more dictionaries followed: in Latin, English, French and Italian. Benjamin Martin&#x27;s &quot;Lingua Britannica Reformata&quot; (1749) and Ainsworth&#x27;s &quot;Thesaurus Linguae Latinae&quot; (1737) are both significant, in that they define entries in separate senses, or aspects, of the word. In English (among others), John Cowell&#x27;s &quot;Interpreter&quot;, a law dictionary, was published in 1607, Edward Phillips&#x27; &quot;The new world of English words&quot; came out in 1658 and a dictionary of 40,000 words had been prepared in 1721 by Nathan Bailey, though none was as comprehensive in breadth or style as Johnson&#x27;s.

The problem with these dictionaries was that they tended to be little more than poorly organised and poorly researched glossaries of &quot;hard words&quot;: words that were technical, foreign, obscure or antiquated. But perhaps the greatest single fault of these early lexicographers was, as historian Henry Hitchings put it, that they &quot;failed to give sufficient sense of [the English] language as it appeared &quot;in use&quot;.&quot; In that sense Dr. Johnson&#x27;s dictionary was the first to comprehensively document the English lexicon.

=== Johnson&#x27;s preparation ===

Johnson&#x27;s dictionary was prepared at 17 Gough Square, London, an eclectic household, between the years of 1746 and 1755. By 1747 Johnson had written his &quot;Plan of a Dictionary of the English Language&quot;, which spelled out his intentions and proposed methodology for preparing his document. He clearly saw benefit in drawing from previous efforts, and saw the process as a parallel to legal precedent (possibly influenced by Cowell):
Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Plan&quot; received the patronage of Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield but not to Johnson&#x27;s pleasure. Chesterfield did not care about praise, but was instead interested by Johnson&#x27;s abilities. Seven years after first meeting Johnson to discuss the work, Chesterfield wrote two anonymous essays in &quot;The World&quot; that recommended the &quot;Dictionary&quot;. He complained that the English language was lacking structure and argued:

However, Johnson did not appreciate the tone of the essay, and he felt that Chesterfield had not made good on his promise to be the work&#x27;s patron. In a letter, Johnson explained his feelings about the matter:
==The text==
&quot;A Dictionary of the English Language&quot; was somewhat large and very expensive. It was printed in-folio, meaning that the pages were tall and nearly wide. The paper was of the finest quality available, the cost of which ran to nearly £1,600; more than Johnson had been paid to write the book. Johnson himself pronounced the book &quot;Vasta mole superbus&quot; (&quot;Proud in its great bulk&quot;). No bookseller could possibly hope to print this book without help; outside a few special editions of the Bible no book of this heft and size had ever been set to type.

The title page reads:

The words &quot;Samuel Johnson&quot; and &quot;English Language&quot; were printed in red; the rest was printed in black. The preface and headings were set in 4.6 mm &quot;English&quot; type, the text—double columned—was set in 3.5 mm pica. This first edition of the dictionary contained a 42,773-word list, to which only a few more were added in subsequent editions. One of Johnson&#x27;s important innovations was to illustrate the meanings of his words by literary quotation, of which there are around 114,000. The authors most frequently cited by Johnson include Shakespeare, Milton and Dryden. For example:

:OPULENCE

:Wealth; riches; affluence

:&quot;There in full &quot;opulence&quot; a banker dwelt,
:Who all the joys and pangs of riches felt;
:His sideboard glitter&#x27;d with imagin&#x27;d plate,
:And his proud fancy held a vast estate.&quot;
:-- Jonathan Swift

Furthermore, Johnson, unlike Bailey, added notes on a word&#x27;s usage, rather than being merely descriptive.

Unlike most modern lexicographers, Johnson introduced humour or prejudice into quite a number of his definitions. Among the best-known are:
*&quot;Excise: a hateful tax levied upon commodities and adjudged not by the common judges of property but wretches hired by those to whom excise is paid&quot;
*&quot;Lexicographer: a writer of dictionaries; a harmless drudge that busies himself in tracing the original and detailing the signification of words&quot;
*&quot;Oats: a grain which in England is generally given to horses, but in Scotland supports the people&quot;

A couple of less well-known examples are:
*&quot;Monsieur: a term of reproach for a Frenchman&quot;
*&quot;Patron: One who countenances, supports, or protects. Commonly a wretch who supports with insolence, and is paid with flattery.&quot; which some have understood to be a jab at his patron Philip Stanhope.

He included whimsical little-known words, such as:
*&quot;Writative – A word of Pope&#x27;s, not to be imitated: &quot;Increase of years makes men more talkative but less &quot;writative&quot;; to that degree I now write letters but of plain how d&#x27;ey&#x27;s.&quot;&quot;

On a more serious level, Johnson&#x27;s work showed a heretofore unseen meticulousness. Unlike all the proto-dictionaries that had come before, painstaking care went into the completeness when it came not only to &quot;illustrations&quot; but also to definitions as well:
*&quot;Turn&quot; had 16 definitions with 15 illustrations
*&quot;Time&quot; had 20 definitions with 14 illustrations
*&quot;Put&quot; ran more than 5,000 words spread over 3 pages
*&quot;Take&quot; had 134 definitions, running 8,000 words, over 5 pages

The original goal was to publish the dictionary in two folio volumes: A–K and L–Z. But that soon proved unwieldy, unprofitable, and unrealistic. Subsequent printings ran to four volumes; even these formed a stack tall, and weighed in at nearly . In addition to the sheer physical heft of Johnson&#x27;s dictionary, came the equally hefty price: £4/10/– (equivalent to approximately £ in 2025). So discouraging was the price that by 1784, thirty years after the first edition was published, when the dictionary had by then run through five editions, only about 6,000 copies were in circulation—an average sale of 200 books a year for thirty years.

Johnson&#x27;s etymologies would be considered poor by modern standards, and he gave little guide to pronunciation; one example being &quot;Cough: A convulsion of the lungs, vellicated by some sharp serosity. It is pronounced coff&quot;. Much of his dictionary was prescriptivist. It was also linguistically conservative, advocating traditional spellings such as &quot;publick&quot; rather than the simpler spellings that would be favoured 73 years later by Noah Webster.

The dictionary is in alphabetical order according to the eighteenth-century English alphabet. In the eighteenth century, the letters I and J were considered different forms of the same letter; the same with letters U and V. As a result, in Johnson&#x27;s dictionary the word jargon comes before the word idle, and vagabond comes before ultimate.

In spite of its shortcomings, the dictionary was far and away the best of its day. Its scope and structure were carried forward in dictionaries that followed, including Noah Webster&#x27;s &quot;Webster&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; in 1828 and the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; later in the same century.

== Reception history ==
=== Initial reception ===
From the beginning there was universal appreciation not only of the content of the &quot;Dictionary&quot; but also of Johnson&#x27;s achievement in single-handedly creating it: &quot;When Boswell came to this part of Johnson&#x27;s life, more than three decades later, he pronounced that &#x27;the world contemplated with wonder so stupendous a work achieved by one man, while other countries had thought such undertakings fit only for whole academies&#x27;.&quot; &quot;The &quot;Dictionary&quot; was considered, from the moment of its inception, to be Johnson&#x27;s, and from the time of its completion it was &quot;Johnson&#x27;s Dictionary&quot;—his book and his property, his monument, his memorial.&quot;

Immediately after publication &quot;The &quot;Dictionary&quot; was enthusiastically written up in important periodicals such as the &quot;London Magazine&quot; and—none too surprisingly—the &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. In the latter it received an eight-page notice&quot;. Reviews, such as they were, proved generous in tone: &quot;Of the less positive assessments the only properly judicious one came from Adam Smith in the pro-Whig &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot; ... he wished that Johnson &#x27;had oftener passed his own censure upon those words which are not of approved use, though sometimes to be met with in authors of no mean name&#x27;. Furthermore, Johnson&#x27;s approach was not &#x27;sufficiently grammatical&#x27;&quot;.

Despite the &quot;Dictionary&quot;″s critical acclaim, Johnson&#x27;s general financial situation continued in its dismal fashion for some years after 1755: &quot;The image of Johnson racing to write &quot;Rasselas&quot; to pay for his mother&#x27;s funeral, romantic hyperbole though it is, conveys the precariousness of his existence, almost four years after his work on the &quot;Dictionary&quot; was done. His financial uncertainties continued. He gave up the house in Gough Square in March 1759, probably for lack of funds. Yet, just as Johnson was plunging into another trough of despondency, the reputation of the &quot;Dictionary&quot; at last brought reward. In July 1762 Johnson was granted a state pension of £300 a year by the twenty-four-year-old monarch, George III. The pension did not make him rich, but it ensured he would no longer have to grub around for the odd guinea.&quot;

=== Criticism ===
As lexicography developed, faults were found with Johnson&#x27;s work: &quot;From an early stage there were noisy detractors. Perhaps the loudest of them was John Horne Tooke ... Not content to pronounce it &#x27;imperfect and faulty&#x27;, he complained that it was &#x27;one of the most idle performances ever offered to the public&#x27;, that its author &#x27;possessed not one single requisite for the undertaking&#x27;, that its grammatical and historical parts were &#x27;most truly contemptible performances&#x27;, and that &#x27;nearly one third ... is as much the language of the Hottentots as of the English&#x27;.&quot; &quot;Horace Walpole summed up for the unbelievers when he pronounced at the end of the eighteenth century, &#x27;I cannot imagine that Dr Johnson&#x27;s reputation will be very lasting.&#x27; His dictionary was &#x27;a surprising work for one man&#x27;, but &#x27;the task is too much for one man, and ... a society should alone pretend to publish a standard dictionary.&#x27; Notwithstanding Walpole&#x27;s reservations, the admirers out-numbered the detractors, and the reputation of the &quot;Dictionary&quot; was repeatedly boosted by other philologists, lexicographers, educationalists and word detectives.&quot;

Johnson&#x27;s dictionary was made when etymology was largely based on guesswork. His Classical leanings led him to prefer spellings that pointed to Latin or Greek sources, &quot;while his lack of sound scholarship prevented him from detecting their frequent errors&quot;. For example, he preferred the spelling &quot;&quot; over &quot;&quot; as he wrongly thought it came from the Greek &quot;achos&quot;. Some of his spelling choices were also inconsistent: &quot;while retaining the Latin &quot;p&quot; in &quot;receipt&quot; he left it out of &quot;deceit&quot;; he spelled &quot;deign&quot; one way and &quot;disdain&quot; another; he spelled &quot;uphill&quot; but &quot;downhil&quot;, &quot;muckhill&quot; but &quot;dunghil&quot;, &quot;instill&quot; but &quot;distil&quot;, &quot;inthrall&quot; but &quot;disenthral&quot;&quot;.

Boswell relates that &quot;A lady once asked him [Johnson] how he came to define &quot;&quot; as the &quot;knee&quot; of a horse: instead of making an elaborate reply, as she expected, he at once replied, &#x27;Ignorance, Madam, pure ignorance.&#x27;&quot; On the same page, Boswell notes that Johnson&#x27;s definition of &quot;&quot; (&quot;Any thing reticulated or decussated, at equal distances, with interstices between the intersections&quot;) &quot;has often been quoted with sportive malignity, as obscuring a thing in itself very plain.&quot;

Other than stress indication, the dictionary did not feature many word-specific orthoepical guidelines, with Johnson stating that &#x27;For pronunciation, the best general rule is, to consider those as the most elegant speakers who deviate least from the written sounds&#x27; and referring to the irregular pronunciations as &#x27;jargon&#x27;; this was subject to coetaneous criticism by John Walker, who wrote in the preface of his &quot;Critical Pronouncing Dictionary&quot; &#x27;It is certain, where custom is equal, this ought to take place; and if the whole body of respectable English speakers were equally divided in thir pronunciation of the word &quot;busy&quot;, one half pronuncing it &quot;bew-ze&quot;, and the other half &quot;biz-ze&quot;, that the former ought to be accounted the most elegant speakers; but till this is the case, the latter pronunciation, though a gross deviation from orthography, will be esteemed the most elegant. Dr. Johnson&#x27;s general rule, therefore, can only take place where custom has not plainly decided.&#x27; Nevertheless, Walker scrupulously followed Johnson&#x27;s explanations of words, as did many contemporary dictionaries.

=== Influence in Britain ===
Despite the criticisms, &quot;The influence of the &quot;Dictionary&quot; was sweeping. Johnson established both a methodology for how dictionaries should be put together and a paradigm for how entries should be presented. Anyone who sought to create a dictionary, post-Johnson, did so in his shadow.&quot; &quot;In his history of the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, Simon Winchester asserts of its eighteenth-century predecessor that &#x27;by the end of the century every educated household had, or had access to, the great book. So firmly established did it swiftly become that any request for &quot;The Dictionary&quot; would bring forth Johnson and none other.&#x27; &#x27;One asked for The Dictionary,&#x27; writes Winchester, &#x27;much as one might demand The Bible.&#x27;&quot; One of the first editors of the &quot;OED&quot;, James Murray, acknowledged that many of Johnson&#x27;s explanations were adopted without change, for &#x27;When his definitions are correct, and his arrangement judicious, it seems to be expedient to follow him.&#x27; ... In the end the &quot;OED&quot; reproduced around 1,700 of Johnson&#x27;s definitions, marking them simply &#x27;J.&#x27;.&quot;

=== Reputation abroad ===
Johnson&#x27;s influence was not confined to Britain and English: &quot;The president of the Florentine Accademia declared that the &quot;Dictionary&quot; would be &#x27;a perpetual Monument of Fame to the Author, an Honour to his own Country in particular, and a general Benefit to the Republic of Letters&#x27;. This was no empty commendation. Johnson&#x27;s work served as a model for lexicographers abroad. It is no surprise that his friend Giuseppe Baretti chose to make the &quot;Dictionary&quot; the model for his Italian—English dictionary of 1760, and for his Spanish dictionary nearly two decades later. But there are numerous examples of influence beyond Johnson&#x27;s own circle. His work was translated into French and German.&quot; And &quot;In 1777, when Ferdinando Bottarelli published a pocket dictionary of Italian, French and English (the three languages side by side), his authorities for the French and Italian words were the works of the French and Italian academies: for the English he used Johnson.&quot;

=== Influence in America ===
The &quot;Dictionary&quot; was exported to America. &quot;The American adoption of the &quot;Dictionary&quot; was a momentous event not just in its history, but in the history of lexicography. For Americans in the second half of the eighteenth century, Johnson was the seminal authority on language, and the subsequent development of American lexicography was coloured by his fame.&quot; For American lexicographers the &quot;Dictionary&quot; was impossible to ignore: &quot;America&#x27;s two great nineteenth-century lexicographers, Noah Webster and Joseph Emerson Worcester, argued fiercely over Johnson&#x27;s legacy ... In 1789 [Webster] declared that &#x27;Great Britain, whose children we are, and whose language we speak, should no longer be &quot;our&quot; standard; for the taste of her writers is already corrupted, and her language on the decline.&#x27;&quot; &quot;Where Webster found fault with Johnson, Joseph Worcester saluted him ... In 1846 he completed his &quot;Universal and Critical Dictionary of the English Language&quot;. He defended Johnson&#x27;s work, arguing that &#x27;from the time of its publication, [it] has been, far more than any other, regarded as the standard for the language&#x27;.&quot; Notwithstanding the evolution of lexicography in America, &quot;The &quot;Dictionary&quot; has also played its part in the law, especially in the United States. Legislators are much occupied with ascertaining &#x27;first meanings&#x27;, with trying to secure the literal sense of their predecessors&#x27; legislation ... Often it is a matter of historicizing language: to understand a law, you need to understand what its terminology meant to its original architects ... as long as the American Constitution remains intact, Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary&quot; will have a role to play in American law.&quot;

== Folio and abridged editions ==

Johnson&#x27;s dictionary came out in two forms.

The first was the 1755 &quot;Folio&quot; edition, which came in two large volumes on 4 April. The folio edition also features full literary quotes by those authors that Johnson quoted, such as Dryden and Shakespeare. It was followed a few weeks later by a second edition published in 165 weekly parts. The third edition was published in 1765, but it was the fourth, which came out in 1773 which included significant revisions by Johnson of the original work.

The &quot;Abridged&quot; edition came out in 1756 in two octavo volumes with entries, &quot;abstracted from the folio edition by the author&quot;, laid out as two columns per page. The abridged version did not feature the literary quotes, just the author quoted. This made it cheaper to produce and buy. It sold over a thousand copies a year for the next 30 years bringing &quot;The Dictionary&quot; to the reach of every literate home.

== Replica editions ==
Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary&quot; has been available in replica editions for some years. The entire first &quot;Folio&quot; edition is available on A Dictionary of the English Language as an electronic scan. As of April 15, 2021, A Dictionary of the English Language will become &quot;Johnsons Dictionary Online&quot;, a project funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities and created by a team of scholars at the University of Central Florida. This version is the first fully searchable online edition and will eventually include the 1775 folio edition.

The Preface to the &quot;Dictionary&quot; is available on Project Gutenberg. In addition, a scan of the 6th (1785) edition can be found at the Internet Archive in its two volumes.

== In popular culture ==
The compilation of Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary&quot; was the main plot-line for an episode of &quot;Blackadder the Third&quot; where Edmund Blackadder (Rowan Atkinson), after confounding the scholar with a barrage of fabricated nonexistent words, tries to conceal the destruction of the dictionary&#x27;s manuscript by his servant. Johnson had given his only manuscript to the Prince and it was presumably destroyed by Blackadder&#x27;s apprentice dogsbody Baldrick. The episode ends with Baldrick obliviously throwing the dictionary into the fire.

&quot;Dr. Johnson&#x27;s Great Dictionary&quot; appears as a plot device in the 1944 Sherlock Holmes film, &quot;The Pearl of Death&quot;, starring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce.

At the end of Chapter 1 of Vanity Fair by William Makepeace Thackeray Becky Sharp disdainfully throws a copy of Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary&quot; out the window.
