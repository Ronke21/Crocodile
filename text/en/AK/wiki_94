<text>Sofia is the capital and largest city of Bulgaria. It is situated in the Sofia Valley at the foot of the Vitosha mountain, in the western part of the country. The city is built west of the Iskar river and has many mineral springs, such as the Sofia Central Mineral Baths. It has a humid continental climate. Being in the centre of the Balkans, it is midway between the Black Sea and the Adriatic Sea and closest to the Aegean Sea.

Known as Serdica in antiquity and Sredets in the Middle Ages, Sofia has been an area of human habitation since at least 7000 BC. The recorded history of the city begins with the attestation of the conquest of Serdica by the Roman Republic in 29 BC from the Celtic tribe Serdi. During the decline of the Roman Empire, the city was raided by Huns, Visigoths, Avars, and Slavs. In 809, Serdica was incorporated into the Bulgarian Empire by Khan Krum and became known as Sredets. In 1018, the Byzantines ended Bulgarian rule until 1194, when it was reincorporated by the reborn Bulgarian Empire. Sredets became a major administrative, economic, cultural and literary hub until its conquest by the Ottomans in 1382. From 1530 to 1836, Sofia was the regional capital of Rumelia Eyalet, the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s key province in Europe. Bulgarian rule was restored in 1878. Sofia was selected as the capital of the Third Bulgarian State in the next year, ushering a period of intense demographic and economic growth.

Sofia is the 14th-largest city in the European Union. It is surrounded by mountainsides, such as Vitosha by the southern side, Lyulin by the western side, and the Balkan Mountains by the north, which makes it the third highest European capital after Andorra la Vella and Madrid. Being Bulgaria&#x27;s primary city, Sofia is home of many of the major local universities, cultural institutions and commercial companies. The city has been described as the &quot;triangle of religious tolerance&quot;. This is because three temples of three major world religions—Christianity, Islam and Judaism—are situated close together: Sveta Nedelya Church, Banya Bashi Mosque and Sofia Synagogue. This triangle was recently expanded to a &quot;square&quot; and includes the Catholic Cathedral of St Joseph.

Sofia has been named one of the top ten best places for startup businesses in the world, especially in information technologies. It was Europe&#x27;s most affordable capital to visit in 2013. The Boyana Church in Sofia, constructed during the Second Bulgarian Empire and holding much patrimonial symbolism to the Bulgarian Orthodox Church, was included onto the World Heritage List in 1979. With its cultural significance in Southeast Europe, Sofia is home to the National Opera and Ballet of Bulgaria, the National Palace of Culture, the Vasil Levski National Stadium, the Ivan Vazov National Theatre, the National Archaeological Museum, and the Serdica Amphitheatre. The Museum of Socialist Art includes many sculptures and posters that educate visitors about the lifestyle in communist Bulgaria.

The population of Sofia declined from 70,000 in the late 18th century, through 19,000 in 1870, to 11,649 in 1878, after which it began increasing. Sofia hosts some 1.28 million residents within a territory of 500 km2, a concentration of 17.9% of the country&#x27;s population within the 200th percentile of the country&#x27;s territory. The urban area of Sofia hosts some 1.54 million residents within 5723 km2, which comprises Sofia City Province and parts of Sofia Province (Dragoman, Slivnitsa, Kostinbrod, Bozhurishte, Svoge, Elin Pelin, Gorna Malina, Ihtiman, Kostenets) and Pernik Province (Pernik, Radomir), representing 5.16% of the country territory. The metropolitan area of Sofia is based upon one hour of car travel time, stretches internationally and includes Dimitrovgrad in Serbia. The metropolitan region of Sofia is inhabited by a population of 1.66 million.

==Names==

For a long time, the city possessed a Thracian name, Serdica (, &quot;Serdikē&quot;, or , &quot;Sardikē&quot;; or ), derived from the tribe , who were either of Thracian, Celtic, or mixed Thracian-Celtic origin. The emperor Marcus Ulpius Traianus (53–117 AD) gave the city the combinative name of &quot;Ulpia Serdica&quot;; Ulpia may be derived from an Umbrian cognate of the Latin word &quot;lupus&quot;, meaning &quot;wolf&quot; or from the Latin &quot;vulpes&quot; (fox). It seems that the first written mention of &quot;Serdica&quot; was made during his reign and the last mention was in the 19th century in a Bulgarian text (, &quot;Sardaki&quot;). Other names given to Sofia, such as Serdonpolis (Byzantine , &quot;City of the Serdi&quot;) and Triaditza (, &quot;Trinity&quot;), were mentioned by Byzantine Greek sources or coins. The Slavic name Sredets (), which is related to &quot;middle&quot; (, &quot;sreda&quot;) and to the city&#x27;s earliest name, first appeared on paper in an 11th-century text. The city was called &quot;Atralisa&quot; by the Arab traveller Idrisi and &quot;Strelisa&quot;, &quot;Stralitsa&quot;, or &quot;Stralitsion&quot; by the Crusaders.

The name &quot;Sofia&quot; comes from the Saint Sofia Church, as opposed to the prevailing Slavic origin of Bulgarian cities and towns. The origin is in the Greek word &quot;sophía&quot; (, &quot;wisdom&quot;). The earliest works where this latest name is registered are the duplicate of the Gospel of Serdica, in a dialogue between two salesmen from Dubrovnik around 1359, in the 14th-century Vitosha Charter of Bulgarian tsar Ivan Shishman and in a Ragusan merchant&#x27;s notes of 1376. In these documents, the city is called &quot;Sofia&quot;, but, at the same time, the region and the city&#x27;s inhabitants are still called &quot;Sredecheski&quot; (, &quot;of Sredets&quot;), which continued until the 20th century. The Ottomans came to favour the name Sofya (). In 1879, there was a dispute about what the name of the new Bulgarian capital should be, when the citizens created a committee of famous people, insisting for the Slavic name. Gradually, a compromise arose, officialisation of &quot;Sofia&quot; for the nationwide institutions, while legitimating the title &quot;Sredets&quot; for the administrative and church institutions, before the latter was abandoned through the years.

==Geography==

Sofia City Province has an area of 1344 km2, while the surrounding and much bigger Sofia Province is 7,059 km2. Sofia&#x27;s development as a significant settlement owes much to its central position in the Balkans. It is situated in western Bulgaria, at the northern foot of the Vitosha mountain, in the Sofia Valley that is surrounded by the Balkan mountains to the north. The valley has an average altitude of . Sofia is the second highest capital of the European Union (after Madrid) and the third highest capital of Europe (after Andorra la Vella and Madrid). Unlike most European capitals, Sofia does not straddle any large river, but is surrounded by comparatively high mountains on all sides. Three mountain passes lead to the city, which have been key roads since antiquity, Vitosha being the watershed between Black and Aegean Seas.

A number of shallow rivers cross the city, including the Boyanska, Vladayska and Perlovska. The Iskar River in its upper course flows near eastern Sofia. It takes its source in Rila, Bulgaria&#x27;s highest mountain, and enters Sofia Valley near the village of German. The Iskar flows north toward the Balkan Mountains, passing between the eastern city suburbs, next to the main building and below the runways of Vasil Levski Sofia Airport, and flows out of the Sofia Valley at the town of Novi Iskar, where the scenic Iskar Gorge begins.

The city is known for its 49 mineral and thermal springs. Artificial and dam lakes were built in the twentieth century.

While the 1818 and 1858 earthquakes were intense and destructive, the 2012 Pernik earthquake occurred west of Sofia with a moment magnitude of 5.6 and a much lower Mercalli intensity of VI (&quot;Strong&quot;). The 2014 Aegean Sea earthquake was also noticed in the city.

===Climate===
Sofia has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;; &quot;Cfb&quot; if with −3 °C isotherm) with an average annual temperature of .

Winters are relatively cold and snowy. In the coldest days temperatures can drop below , most notably in January. The lowest recorded temperature is (16 January 1893). On average, Sofia receives a total snowfall of and 56 days with snow cover. The snowiest recorded winter was 1939/1940 with a total snowfall of . The record snow depth is (25 December 2001). The coldest recorded year was 1893 with an average January temperature of and an annual temperature of .

Summers are quite warm and sunny. In summer, the city generally remains slightly cooler than other parts of Bulgaria, due to its higher altitude. However, the city is also subject to heat waves with high temperatures reaching or exceeding on the hottest days, particularly in July and August. The highest recorded temperature is (5 July 2000). The hottest recorded month was July 2012 with an average temperature of . The warmest year on record was 2024 with an annual temperature of .

Springs and autumns in Sofia are usually short with variable and dynamic weather.

The city receives an average precipitation of a year, reaching its peak in late spring and early summer when thunderstorms are common. The driest recorded year was 2000 with a total precipitation of , while the wettest year on record was 2014 with a total precipitation of .

=== Environment ===
The geographic position of the Sofia Valley limits the flow of air masses, increasing the chances of air pollution by particulate matter and nitrogen oxide. Solid fuel used for heating and motor vehicle traffic are significant sources of pollutants. Smog thus persists over the city as temperature inversions and the mountains surrounding the city prevent the circulation of air masses. As a result, air pollution levels in Sofia are some of the highest in Europe.

Particulate matter concentrations are consistently above the norm. During the October 2017 – March 2018 heating season, particulate levels exceeded the norm on 70 occasions; on 7 January 2018, PM10 levels reached 632 μg/m3, some twelve times the EU norm of 50 μg/m3. Even areas with few sources of air pollution, like Gorna Banya, had PM2.5 and PM10 levels above safe thresholds. In response to hazardous spikes in air pollution, the Municipal Council implemented a variety of measures in January 2018, like more frequent washing of streets. However, a report by the European Court of Auditors issued in September 2018 revealed that Sofia has not drafted any projects to reduce air pollution from heating. The report also noted that no industrial pollution monitoring stations operate in Sofia, even though industrial facilities are active in the city. A monitoring station on Eagles&#x27; Bridge, where some of the highest particulate matter values were measured, was moved away from the location and has measured sharply lower values since then. Particulates are now largely measured by a network of 300 sensors maintained by volunteers since 2017. The European Commission has taken Bulgaria to court over its failure to curb air pollution.

==History==

===Prehistory and antiquity===

The area has a history of nearly 7,000 years, with the great attraction of the hot water springs that still flow abundantly in the centre of the city. The neolithic village in Slatina dating to the 5th–6th millennium BC is documented. Another neolithic settlement was founded in the 3rd–4th millennium BC near the site of the modern National Art Gallery, which has been the traditional centre of the city ever since.

The earliest tribes who settled were the Thracian Tilataei. 
In the 500s BC, the area became part of a Thracian state union, the Odrysian kingdom from another Thracian tribe the Odrysses.

In 339 BC Philip II of Macedon destroyed and ravaged the town for the first time.

The Celtic tribe Serdi gave their name to the city. The earliest mention of the city comes from an Athenian inscription from the 1st century BC, attesting &quot;Astiu ton Serdon&quot;, i.e. city of the Serdi. According to the inscription and to the writings of Dio Cassius, the Roman general Crassus subdued the Serdi and behanded the captives.

Dio Cassius, Pliny the Elder and Ptolemy say that in 27–29 BC Crassus attacked the region &quot;Segetike&quot;, which is assumed to be Serdica, or the city of the Serdi. The ancient city is located between TZUM, Sheraton Hotel and the Presidency. It gradually became the most important Roman city of the region. It became a &quot;municipium&quot; during the reign of Emperor Trajan (98–117). Serdica expanded, as turrets, protective walls, public baths, administrative and cult buildings, a civic basilica, an amphitheatre, a circus, the City council (Boulé), a large forum, a big circus (theatre), etc. were built. Serdica was a significant city on the Roman road Via Militaris, connecting Singidunum and Byzantium. In the 3rd century, it became the capital of Dacia Aureliana, and when Emperor Diocletian divided the province of Dacia Aureliana into Dacia Ripensis (at the banks of the Danube) and Dacia Mediterranea, Serdica became the capital of the latter. Serdica&#x27;s citizens of Thracian descent were referred to as Illyrians probably because it was at some time the capital of Eastern Illyria (Second Illyria).
Roman emperors Aurelian (215–275) and Galerius (260–311) were born in Serdica.

The city expanded and became a significant political and economical centre, more so as it became one of the first Roman cities where Christianity was recognised as an official religion (under Galerius). The Edict of Toleration by Galerius was issued in 311 in Serdica by the Roman emperor Galerius, officially ending the Diocletianic persecution of Christianity. The Edict implicitly granted Christianity the status of &quot;religio licita&quot;, a worship recognised and accepted by the Roman Empire. It was the first edict legalising Christianity, preceding the Edict of Milan by two years.

Serdica was the capital of the Diocese of Dacia (337–602).

For Constantine the Great it was &#x27;Sardica mea Roma est&#x27; (Serdica is my Rome). He considered making Serdica the capital of the Byzantine Empire instead of Constantinople. which was already not dissimilar to a tetrarchic capital of the Roman Empire. In 343 AD, the Council of Sardica was held in the city, in a church located where the current 6th century Church of Saint Sophia was later built.

The city was destroyed in the 447 invasion of the Huns and laid in ruins for a century It was rebuilt by Byzantine Emperor Justinian I. During the reign of Justinian it flourished, being surrounded with great fortress walls whose remnants can still be seen today.

=== Middle Ages ===

Serdica became part of the First Bulgarian Empire during the reign of Khan Krum in 809, after a long siege. The fall of the strategic city prompted a major and ultimately disastrous invasion of Bulgaria by the Byzantine emperor Nikephoros I, which led to his demise at the hands of the Bulgarian army. In the aftermath of the war, the city was permanently integrated in Bulgaria and became known by the Slavic name of Sredets. It grew into an important fortress and administrative centre under Krum&#x27;s successor Khan Omurtag, who made it a centre of Sredets province (Sredetski komitat, Средецки комитат). The Bulgarian patron saint John of Rila was buried in Sredets by orders of Emperor Peter I in the mid 10th century. After the conquest of the Bulgarian capital Preslav by Sviatoslav I of Kyiv and John I Tzimiskes&#x27; armies in 970–971, the Bulgarian Patriarch Damyan chose Sredets for his seat in the next year and the capital of Bulgaria was temporarily moved there. In the second half of 10th century the city was ruled by Komit Nikola and his sons, known as the &quot;Komitopuli&quot;. One of them was Samuil, who was eventually crowned Emperor of Bulgaria in 997. In 986, the Byzantine Emperor Basil II laid siege to Sredets but after 20 days of fruitless assaults the garrison broke out and forced the Byzantines to abandon the campaign. On his way to Constantinople, Basil II was ambushed and soundly defeated by the Bulgarians in the battle of the Gates of Trajan.

The city eventually fell to the Byzantine Empire in 1018, following the Byzantine conquest of Bulgaria. Sredets joined the uprising of Peter Delyan in 1040–1041 in a failed attempt to restore Bulgarian independence and was the last stronghold of the rebels, led by the local commander Botko. During the 11th century many Pechenegs were settled down in Sofia region as Byzantine federats.

It was once again incorporated into the restored Bulgarian Empire in 1194 at the time of Emperor Ivan Asen I and became a major administrative and cultural centre. Several of the city&#x27;s governors were members of the Bulgarian imperial family and held the title of &quot;sebastokrator&quot;, the second highest at the time, after the tsar. Some known holders of the title were Kaloyan, Peter and their relative Aleksandar Asen (d. after 1232), a son of Ivan Asen I of Bulgaria (). In the 13th and 14th centuries Sredets was an important spiritual and literary hub with a cluster of 14 monasteries in its vicinity, that were eventually destroyed by the Ottomans. The city produced multicolored sgraffito ceramics, jewelry and ironware.

In 1382/1383 or 1385, Sredets was seized by the Ottoman Empire in the course of the Bulgarian-Ottoman Wars by Lala Şahin Pasha, following a three-month siege. The Ottoman commander left the following description of the city garrison: &quot;Inside the fortress [Sofia] there is a large and elite army, its soldiers are heavily built, moustached and look war-hardened, but are used to consume wine and rakia—in a word, jolly fellows.&quot;

=== Early modern history ===
From the 14th century till the 19th century Sofia was an important administrative center in the Ottoman Empire. It became the capital of the beylerbeylik of Rumelia (Rumelia Eyalet), the province that administered the Ottoman lands in Europe (the Balkans), one of the two together with the beylerbeylik of Anatolia. It was the capital of the important Sanjak of Sofia as well, including the whole of Thrace with Plovdiv and Edirne, and part of Macedonia with Thessaloniki and Skopje.

During the initial stages of the Crusade of Varna in 1443, it was occupied by Hungarian forces for a short time in 1443, and the Bulgarian population celebrated a mass Saint Sofia Church. Following the defeat of the crusader forces in 1444, the city&#x27;s Christians faced persecution. In 1530 Sofia became the capital of the Ottoman province (beylerbeylik) of Rumelia for about three centuries. During that time Sofia was the largest import-export-base in modern-day Bulgaria for the caravan trade with the Republic of Ragusa. In the 15th and 16th century, Sofia was expanded by Ottoman building activity. Public investments in infrastructure, education and local economy brought greater diversity to the city. Amongst others, the population consisted of Muslims, Bulgarian and Greek speaking Orthodox Christians, Armenians, Georgians, Catholic Ragusans, Jews (Romaniote, Ashkenazi and Sephardi), and Romani people. The 16th century was marked by a wave of persecutions against the Bulgarian Christians, a total of nine became New Martyrs in Sofia and were sainted by the Orthodox Church, including George the New (1515), Sophronius of Sofia (1515), George the Newest (1530), Nicholas of Sofia (1555) and Terapontius of Sofia (1555).

When it comes to the cityscape, 16th century sources mention eight Friday mosques, three public libraries, numerous schools, 12 churches, three synagogues, and the largest bedesten (market) of the Balkans. Additionally, there were fountains and &quot;hammams&quot; (bathhouses). Most prominent churches such as Saint Sofia and Saint George were converted into mosques, and a number of new ones were constructed, including Banya Bashi Mosque built by the Ottoman architect Mimar Sinan. In total there were 11 big and over 100 small mosques by the 17th century. In 1610 the Vatican established the See of Sofia for Catholics of Rumelia, which existed until 1715 when most Catholics had emigrated. There was an important uprising against Ottoman rule in Sofia, Samokov and Western Bulgaria in 1737.

Sofia entered a period of economic and political decline in the 17th century, accelerated during the period of anarchy in the Ottoman Balkans of the late 18th and early 19th century, when local Ottoman warlords ravaged the countryside. 1831 Ottoman population statistics show that 42% of the Christians were non-taxpayers in the kaza of Sofia and the amount of middle-class and poor Christians were equal. Since the 18th century the &quot;beylerbeys&quot; of Rumelia often stayed in Bitola, which became the official capital of the province in 1826. Sofia remained the seat of a sanjak (district). By the 19th century the Bulgarian population had two schools and seven churches, contributing to the Bulgarian National Revival. In 1858 Nedelya Petkova created the first Bulgarian school for women in the city. In 1867 was inaugurated the first &quot;chitalishte&quot; in Sofia – a Bulgarian cultural institution. In 1870 the Bulgarian revolutionary Vasil Levski established a revolutionary committee in the city and in the neighbouring villages. Following his capture in 1873, Vasil Levski was transferred and hanged in Sofia by the Ottomans.

===Modern and contemporary history===
During the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78, Suleiman Pasha threatened to burn the city in defence, but the foreign diplomats Leandre Legay, Vito Positano, Rabbi Gabriel Almosnino and Josef Valdhart refused to leave the city thus saving it. Many Bulgarian residents of Sofia armed themselves and sided with the Russian forces. Sofia was relieved (see Battle of Sofia) from Ottoman rule by Russian forces under Gen. Iosif Gurko on 4 January 1878. It was proposed as a capital by Marin Drinov and was accepted as such on 3 April 1879. By the time of its liberation, the population of the city was 11,649.

Most mosques in Sofia were destroyed in that war, seven of them destroyed in one night in December 1878 when a thunderstorm masked the noise of the explosions arranged by Russian military engineers. Following the war, the great majority of the Muslim population left Sofia.

For a few decades after the liberation, Sofia experienced large population growth, mainly by migration from other regions of the Principality (Kingdom since 1908) of Bulgaria, and from the still Ottoman Macedonia and Thrace.

In 1900, the first electric lightbulb in the city was turned on.

In the Second Balkan War, Bulgaria was fighting alone practically all of its neighbouring countries. When the Romanian Army entered Vrazhdebna in 1913, then a village from Sofia, now a suburb, this prompted the Tsardom of Bulgaria to capitulate. During the war, Sofia was flown by the Romanian Air Corps, which engaged on photoreconnaissance operations and threw propaganda pamphlets to the city. Thus, Sofia became the first capital on the world to be overflown by enemy aircraft.

During the Second World War, Bulgaria declared war on the US and UK on 13 December 1941 and in late 1943 and early 1944 the US and UK Air forces conducted bombings over Sofia. As a consequence of the bombings thousands of buildings were destroyed or damaged including the Capital Library and thousands of books. In 1944 Sofia and the rest of Bulgaria was occupied by the Soviet Red Army and within days of the Soviet invasion Bulgaria declared war on Nazi Germany.

In 1945, the communist Fatherland Front took power. The transformations of Bulgaria into the People&#x27;s Republic of Bulgaria in 1946 and into the Republic of Bulgaria in 1990 marked significant changes in the city&#x27;s appearance. The population of Sofia expanded rapidly due to migration from rural regions. New residential areas were built in the outskirts of the city, like Druzhba, Mladost and Lyulin.

During the Communist Party rule, a number of the city&#x27;s most emblematic streets and squares were renamed for ideological reasons, with the original names restored after 1989.

The Georgi Dimitrov Mausoleum, where Dimitrov&#x27;s body had been preserved in a similar way to the Lenin mausoleum, was demolished in 1999.

==Cityscape==
In Sofia there are 607,473 dwellings and 101,696 buildings. According to modern records, 39,551 dwellings were constructed until 1949, 119,943 between 1950 and 1969, 287,191 between 1970 and 1989, 57,916 in the 90s and 102,623 between 2000 and 2011. Until 1949, 13,114 buildings were constructed and between 10,000 and 20,000 in each following decade. Sofia&#x27;s architecture combines a wide range of architectural styles, some of which are aesthetically incompatible. These vary from Christian Roman architecture and medieval Bulgarian fortresses to Neoclassicism and prefabricated Socialist-era apartment blocks, as well as newer glass buildings and international architecture. A number of ancient Roman, Byzantine and medieval Bulgarian buildings are preserved in the centre of the city. These include the 4th century Rotunda of St. George, the walls of the Serdica fortress and the partially preserved Amphitheatre of Serdica.

After the Liberation War, knyaz Alexander Battenberg invited architects from Austria-Hungary to shape the new capital&#x27;s architectural appearance.

Among the architects invited to work in Bulgaria were Friedrich Grünanger, Adolf Václav Kolář, and Viktor Rumpelmayer, who designed the most important public buildings needed by the newly re-established Bulgarian government, as well as numerous houses for the country&#x27;s elite. Later, many foreign-educated Bulgarian architects also contributed. The architecture of Sofia&#x27;s centre is thus a combination of Neo-Baroque, Neo-Rococo, Neo-Renaissance and Neoclassicism, with the Vienna Secession also later playing an important part, but it is most typically Central European.

After World War II and the establishment of a Communist government in Bulgaria in 1944, the architectural style was substantially altered. Stalinist Gothic public buildings emerged in the centre, notably the spacious government complex around The Largo, Vasil Levski Stadium, the Cyril and Methodius National Library and others. As the city grew outwards, the then-new neighbourhoods were dominated by many concrete tower blocks, prefabricated panel apartment buildings and examples of Brutalist architecture.

After the abolition of Communism in 1989, Sofia witnessed the construction of whole business districts and neighbourhoods, as well as modern skyscraper-like glass-fronted office buildings, but also top-class residential neighbourhoods. The Capital Fort Business Centre is the first skyscraper in Bulgaria, with its 36 floors. However, the end of the old administration and centrally planned system also paved the way for chaotic and unrestrained construction, which continues today.


===Green areas===

The city has an extensive green belt. Some of the neighbourhoods constructed after 2000 are densely built up and lack green spaces. There are four principal parks – Borisova gradina in the city centre and the &quot;Southern&quot;, &quot;Western&quot; and &quot;Northern&quot; parks. Several smaller parks, among which the Vazrazhdane Park, Zaimov Park, City Garden and the Doctors&#x27; Garden, are located in central Sofia. The Vitosha Nature Park (the oldest national park in the Balkans) includes most of Vitosha mountain and covers an area of , with roughly half of it lying within the municipality of Sofia. Vitosha mountain is a popular hiking destination due to its proximity and ease of access via car and public transport. Two functioning cable cars provide year long access from the outskirts of the city. The mountain offers favourable skiing conditions during the winter. During the 1970s and the 1980s multiple ski slopes of varying difficulty were made available. Skiing equipment can be rented and skiing lessons are available. However, due to the bad communication between the private offshore company that runs the resort and Sofia municipality, most of the ski areas have been left to decay in the last 10 years, so that only one chairlift and one slope work.

==Government and law==
===Local government===
Sofia Municipality is identical to Sofia City Province, which is distinct from Sofia Province, which surrounds but does not include the capital itself. Besides the city proper, the 24 districts of Sofia Municipality encompass three other towns and 34 villages. Districts and settlements have their own mayor who is elected in a popular election. The assembly members are chosen every four years. The common head of Sofia Municipality and all the 38 settlements is the mayor of Sofia. The mayor Vasil Terziev is serving his first term, having won the 2023 election as the nominee of the PP-DB coalition and the local Save Sofia party. After winning the first round of the election without receiving the majority of votes, Terziev entered a tight runoff against BSP candidate Vanya Grigorova, which he won with 175,044 votes, compared to Grigorova’s 170,258.

===National government===
Sofia is the seat of the executive (Council of Ministers), legislative (National Assembly) and judiciary (Supreme Court and Constitutional Court) bodies of Bulgaria, as well as all government agencies, ministries, the National Bank, and the delegation of the European Commission. The President, along with the Council of Ministers, is located on Independence Square, also known as The Largo or &quot;The Triangle of Power&quot;. One of the three buildings in the architectural ensemble, the former Bulgarian Communist Party headquarters, is due to become the seat of the Parliament. A refurbishment project is due to be completed in mid-2019, while the old National Assembly building will become a museum or will only host ceremonial political events.


Under Bulgaria&#x27;s centralised political system, Sofia concentrates much of the political and financial resources of the country. It is the only city in Bulgaria to host three electoral constituencies: the 23rd, 24th and 25th Multi-member Constituencies, which together field 42 mandates in the 240-member National Assembly.

=== Crime ===
With a murder rate of 1.7/per 100.000 people () Sofia is a relatively safe capital city. Nevertheless, in the 21st century, crimes, including Bulgarian mafia killings, caused problems in the city, where authorities had difficulties convicting the actors, which had caused the European Commission to warn the Bulgarian government that the country would not be able to join the EU unless it curbed crime (Bulgaria eventually joined in 2007). Many of the most severe crimes are contract killings that are connected to organised crime, but these had dropped in recent years after several arrests of gang members. Corruption in Bulgaria also affects Sofia&#x27;s authorities. According to the director of Sofia District Police Directorate, the largest share of the crimes are thefts, making up 62.4% of all crimes in the capital city. Increasing are frauds, drug-related crimes, petty theft and vandalism. According to a survey, almost a third of Sofia&#x27;s residents say that they never feel safe in the Bulgarian capital, while 20% always feel safe. , the consumer-reported perceived crime risk on the Numbeo database was &quot;high&quot; for theft and vandalism and &quot;low&quot; for violent crimes; safety while walking during daylight was rated &quot;very high&quot;, and &quot;moderate&quot; during the night. With 1,600 prisoners, the incarceration rate is above 0.1%; however, roughly 70% of all prisoners are part of the Romani minority.

==Culture==
===Arts and entertainment===
Sofia concentrates the majority of Bulgaria&#x27;s leading performing arts troupes. Theatre is by far the most popular form of performing art, and theatrical venues are among the most visited, second only to cinemas. There were 3,162 theatric performances with 570,568 people attending in 2014. The Ivan Vazov National Theatre, which performs mainly classical plays and is situated in the very centre of the city, is the most prominent theatre. The National Opera and Ballet of Bulgaria is a combined opera and ballet collective established in 1891. Regular performances began in 1909. Some of Bulgaria&#x27;s most famous operatic singers, such as Nicolai Ghiaurov and Ghena Dimitrova, made their first appearances on the stage of the National Opera and Ballet.

Cinema is the most popular form of entertainment: there were more than 141,000 film shows with a total attendance exceeding 2,700,000 in 2014. Over the past two decades, numerous independent cinemas have closed and most shows are in shopping centre multiplexes. &quot;Odeon&quot; (not part of the Odeon Cinemas chain) shows exclusively European and independent American films, as well as 20th century classics. The Boyana Film studios was at the centre of a once-thriving domestic film industry, which declined significantly after 1990. Nu Image acquired the studios to upgrade them into Nu Boyana Film Studios, used to shoot scenes for a number of action movies like &quot;The Expendables 2&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;London Has Fallen&quot;.

Bulgaria&#x27;s largest art museums are located in the central areas of the city. Since 2015, the National Art Gallery, located in the former royal palace, the National Gallery for Foreign Art (NGFA) and the Museum of Contemporary Art – Sofia Arsenal were merged to form the National Gallery. Its largest branch is Kvadrat 500, located on the NFGA premises, where some 2,000 works are on display in twenty eight exhibition halls. The collections encompass diverse cultural items, from Ashanti Empire sculptures and Buddhist art to Dutch Golden Age painting, works by Albrecht Dürer, Jean-Baptiste Greuze and Auguste Rodin. The crypt of the Alexander Nevsky cathedral is another branch of the National Gallery. It holds a collection of Eastern Orthodox icons from the 9th to the 19th century.

The National History Museum, located in Boyana, it has a vast collection of more than 650,000 historical items dating from Prehistory to the modern era, although only 10,000 of them are permanently displayed due to the lack of space. Smaller collections of historical items are displayed in the National Archaeological Museum, a former mosque located between the edifices of the National Bank and the Presidency. Two natural sciences museums—the Natural History Museum and Earth and Man—display minerals, animal species (alive and taxidermic) and rare materials. The Ethnographic Museum and the Museum of Military History hold large collections of Bulgarian folk costumes and armaments, respectively. The Polytechnical Museum has more than 1,000 technological items on display. The SS. Cyril and Methodius National Library, the foremost information repository in the country, holds some 1,800,000 books and more than 7,000,000 documents, manuscripts, maps and other items. 
The city houses many cultural institutes such as the Russian Cultural Institute, the Polish Cultural Institute, the Hungarian Institute, the Czech and the Slovak Cultural Institutes, the Italian Cultural Institute, Confucius Institute, Institut Français, Goethe Institut, British Council and Instituto Cervantes which regularly organise temporary expositions of visual, sound and literary works by artists from their respective countries.

Some of the biggest telecommunications companies, TV and radio stations, newspapers, magazines, and web portals are based in Sofia, including the Bulgarian National Television, bTV and Nova TV. Top-circulation newspapers include &quot;24 Chasa&quot; and &quot;Trud&quot;.

The Boyana Church, a UNESCO World Heritage site, contains realistic frescoes, depicting more than 240 human images and a total 89 scenes, were painted. With their vital, humanistic realism they are a Renaissance phenomenon at its culmination phase in the context of the common-European art.

===Tourism===
Sofia is one of the most visited tourist destinations in Bulgaria alongside coastal and mountain resorts. Among its highlights is the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, one of the symbols of Bulgaria, constructed in the late 19th century. It occupies an area of and can hold 10,000 people.

The city center contains many remains of ancient Serdica that have been excavated and are on public display, including &quot;Complex Ancient Serdica&quot;, eastern gate, western gate, city walls, thermal baths, 4th c. church of St. George Rotunda, amphitheatre of Serdica, the tombs and basilicas under the basilica of St. Sophia.

Vitosha Boulevard, also called &quot;Vitoshka&quot;, is a pedestrian zone with numerous cafés, restaurants, fashion boutiques, and luxury goods stores. Sofia&#x27;s geographic location, in the foothills of the weekend retreat Vitosha mountain, further adds to the city&#x27;s specific atmosphere.

==Sports==

A large number of sports clubs are based in the city. During the Communist era, most sports clubs concentrated on all-round sporting development, therefore CSKA, Levski, Lokomotiv, and Slavia are dominant not only in football, but in many other team sports as well. Basketball and volleyball also have strong traditions in Sofia. A notable local basketball team is twice European Champions Cup finalist Lukoil Akademik. The Bulgarian Volleyball Federation is the world&#x27;s second-oldest, and it was an exhibition tournament organised by the BVF in Sofia that convinced the International Olympic Committee to include volleyball as an olympic sport in 1957. Tennis is increasingly popular in the city. There are some ten tennis court complexes within the city including the one founded by former WTA top-five athlete Magdalena Maleeva.

Sofia applied to host the Winter Olympic Games in 1992 and in 1994, coming second and third respectively. The city was also an applicant for the 2014 Winter Olympics, but was not selected as candidate. In addition, Sofia hosted EuroBasket 1957 and the 1961 and 1977 Summer Universiades, as well as the 1983 and 1989 winter editions. In 2012, it hosted the FIVB World League finals.

The city is home to a number of large sports venues, including the 43,000-seat Vasil Levski National Stadium which hosts international football matches, as well as Balgarska Armia Stadium, Georgi Asparuhov Stadium and Lokomotiv Stadium, the main venues for outdoor musical concerts. Arena Sofia holds many indoor events and has a capacity of up to 19,000 people depending on its use. The venue was inaugurated on 30 July 2011, and the first event it hosted was a friendly volleyball match between Bulgaria and Serbia. There are two ice skating complexes — the Winter Sports Palace with a capacity of 4,600 and the Slavia Winter Stadium with a capacity of 2,000, both containing two rinks each. A velodrome with 5,000 seats in the city&#x27;s central park is undergoing renovation. There are also various other sports complexes in the city which belong to institutions other than football clubs, such as those of the National Sports Academy, the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, or those of different universities. There are more than fifteen swimming complexes in the city, most of them outdoor. Nearly all of these were constructed as competition venues and therefore have seating facilities for several hundred people.

There are two golf courses just to the east of Sofia — in Elin Pelin (St Sofia club) and in Ihtiman (Air Sofia club), and a horseriding club (St George club).
Sofia was designated as European Capital of Sport in 2018. The decision was announced in November 2014 by the Evaluation Committee of ACES Europe, on the grounds that &quot;the city is a good example of sport for all, as means to improve healthy lifestyle, integration and education, which are the basis of the initiative&quot;.

According to 2018 data, the city has a population of 1,400,384 and the whole Sofia Capital Municipality of 1,500,120. The first census carried out in February 1878 by the Russian Army recorded a population of 11,694 inhabitants including 6,560 Bulgarians, 3,538 Jews, 839 Turks, and 737 Romani.

The ratio of women per 1,000 men was 1,102. The birth rate per 1000 people was 12.3 per mile and steadily increasing in the last 5 years, the death rate reaching 12.1 per mile and decreasing. The natural growth rate during 2009 was 0.2 per mile, the first positive growth rate in nearly 20 years. The considerable immigration to the capital from poorer regions of the country, as well as urbanisation, are among the other reasons for the increase in Sofia&#x27;s population. The infant mortality rate was 5.6 per 1,000, down from 18.9 in 1980. According to the 2011 census, people aged 20–24 years are the most numerous group, numbering 133,170 individuals and accounting for 11% of the total 1,202,761 people. The median age is 38 though.

The largest group are occupied in trading, followed by those in the manufacturing industry. Within the municipality, three-quarters, or 965,328 people are recorded as having access to television at home and 836,435 (64.8%) as having internet. Out of 464,865 homes – 432,847 have connection to the communal sanitary sewer, while 2,732 do not have any. Of these 864 do not have any water supply and 688 have other than communal.

Sofia was declared the national capital in 1879. One year later, in 1880, it was the fifth-largest city in the country after Plovdiv, Varna, Ruse and Shumen. Plovdiv remained the most populous Bulgarian town until 1892 when Sofia took the lead. The city is the hot spot of internal migration, the capital population is increasing and is around 17% of the national, thus a small number of people with local roots remain today, they dominate the surrounding rural suburbs and are called Shopi. Shopi speak the Western Bulgarian dialects.

==Economy==

Sofia is ranked as Beta- global city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. It is the economic hub of Bulgaria and home to most major Bulgarian and international companies operating in the country, as well as the Bulgarian National Bank and the Bulgarian Stock Exchange. The city is ranked 62nd among financial centres worldwide. In 2015, Sofia was ranked 30th out of 300 global cities in terms of combined growth in employment and real gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, the highest one amongst cities in Southeast Europe. The real GDP (PPP) per capita growth at the time was 2.5% and the employment went up by 3.4% to 962,400. In 2015, Forbes listed Sofia as one of the top 10 places in the world to launch a startup business, because of the low corporate tax (10%), the fast internet connection speeds available – one of the fastest in the world, and the presence of several investment funds, including Eleven Startup Accelerator, LAUNCHub and Neveq.

The city&#x27;s GDP (PPS) per capita stood at €29,600 ($33,760) in 2015, one of the highest in Southeast Europe and well above other cities in the country. The total nominal GDP in 2018 was 38.5 billion leva ($22.4 billion), or 33,437 leva ($19,454) per capita, and average monthly wages in March 2020 were $1,071, the highest nationally. Services dominate the economy, accounting for 88.6% of the gross value added, followed by industry 11.3% and agriculture 0.1%.

Historically, after World War II and the era of industrialisation under socialism, the city and its surrounding areas expanded rapidly and became the most heavily industrialised region of the country, with numerous factories producing steel, pig iron, machinery, industrial equipment, electronics, trams, chemicals, textiles, and food. The influx of workers from other parts of the country became so intense that a restriction policy was imposed, and residing in the capital was only possible after obtaining Sofianite citizenship. However, after the political changes in 1989, this kind of citizenship was removed.

The most dynamic sectors include Information technology (IT) and manufacturing. Sofia is a regional IT hub, ranking second among the Top 10 fastest growing tech centers in Europe in terms of annual growth of active members. The sector employs about 50,000 professionals, 30% of them involved in programming, and contributes for 14% of the city&#x27;s exports. The IT sector is highly diverse and includes both multinational corporations, local companies and startups. Multinationals with major research, development, innovation and engineering centers in Sofia include the second largest global IT center of Coca-Cola, Ubisoft, Hewlett-Packard, VMware, Robert Bosch GmbH, Financial Times, Experian, etc. Several office and tech clusters have been established across the city, including Business Park Sofia, Sofia Tech Park, Capital Fort and others.

Manufacturing has registered a strong recovery since 2012, increasing the exports three-fold and the employment by 52% accounting for over 70,000 jobs. Supported by the city&#x27;s R&amp;D expertise, Sofia is shifting to high value-added manufacturing including electrical equipment, precision mechanics, pharmaceuticals. There are 16 industrial and logistics parks in Sofia, some sprawling to towns in neighbouring Sofia Province, such as Bozhurishte, Kostinbrod and Elin Pelin. Manufacturing companies include Woodward, Inc., producing airframe and industrial turbomachinery systems, Festo, producing microsensors, Visteon, development and engineering of instrument clusters, LCD displays and domain controllers, , producing micro-electronic semiconductor solutions in the automotive sector, Sopharma, producing pharmaceuticals, the largest Lufthansa Technik maintenance facilities outside Germany etc.

==Transport and infrastructure==

With its developing infrastructure and strategic location, Sofia is a major hub for international railway and automobile transport. Three of the ten Pan-European Transport Corridors cross the city: IV, VIII, and X. All major types of transport (except water) are represented in the city.

The Central Railway Station is the primary hub for domestic and international rail transport, carried out by Bulgarian State Railways (BDZ), the national rail company headquartered in the city. It is one of the main stations along BDZ Line 1, and a hub of Lines 2, 5, and 13. Line 1 provides a connection to Plovdiv, the second-largest city in Bulgaria, while Line 2 is the longest national railway and connects Sofia and Varna, the largest coastal city. Lines 5 and 13 are shorter and provide connections to Kulata and Bankya, respectively. Overall, Sofia has of railway lines.

Sofia Airport handled 7,922,702 passengers in 2024.

Public transport is well-developed with bus (), tram (), and trolleybus () lines running in all areas of the city. The Sofia Metro became operational in January 1998 with only 5 stations and currently has four lines and 47 stations. , the system has of track. Six new stations were opened in 2009, two more in April 2012, and eleven more in August 2012. In 2015 seven new stations were opened and the underground extended to Vasil Levski Sofia Airport on its Northern branch and to Business Park Sofia on its Southern branch. In July 2016 the Vitosha Metro Station was opened on the M2 main line. A third line was opened in August 2020 and re-organisation of the previous lines lead to a 4th line being created. This line will complete the proposed underground system of three lines with about of lines. The master plan for the Sofia Metro includes three lines with a total of 63 stations. Until the late 2010s route taxis (marshrutka) provided an efficient and popular means of transport by being faster than public transport, but cheaper than taxis. Their use declined with the expansion of the metro and they were gradually phased out. There are around 13,000 taxi cabs operating in the city. Additionally, all-electric vehicles are available through carsharing company Spark, which is set to increase its fleet to 300 cars by mid-2019.

Private automobile ownership has grown rapidly in the 1990s; more than 1,000,000 cars were registered in Sofia after 2002. The city has the 4th-highest number of automobiles per capita in the European Union at 546.4 vehicles per 1,000 people. The municipality was known for minor and cosmetic repairs and many streets are in a poor condition. This is noticeably changing in the past years. There are different boulevards and streets in the city with a higher amount of traffic than others. These include Tsarigradsko shose, Cherni Vrah, Bulgaria, Slivnitsa, and Todor Aleksandrov boulevards, as well as the city&#x27;s ring road. Consequently, traffic and air pollution problems have become more severe and receive regular criticism in local media. The extension of the underground system is hoped to alleviate the city&#x27;s immense traffic problems.

Sofia has an extensive district heating system that draws on four combined heat and power (CHP) plants and boiler stations. Virtually the entire city (900,000 households and 5,900 companies) is centrally heated, using residual heat from electricity generation (3,000 MW) and gas- and oil-fired heating furnaces; total heat capacity is 4,640 MW. The heat distribution piping network is long and comprises 14,000 substations and 10,000 heated buildings.

==Education and science==
Much of Bulgaria&#x27;s educational capacity is concentrated in Sofia. There are 221 general, 11 special and seven arts or sports schools, 56 vocational gymnasiums and colleges, and four independent colleges. The city also hosts 23 of Bulgaria&#x27;s 51 higher education establishments and more than 105,000 university students. The American College of Sofia, a private secondary school with roots in a school founded by American missionaries in 1860, is among the oldest American educational institutions outside of the United States.

A number of secondary language schools provide education in a selected foreign language. These include the First English Language School, 91st German Language School, 164th Spanish Language School, and the Lycée Français. These are among the most sought-after secondary schools, along with Vladislav the Grammarian 73rd Secondary School and the High School of Mathematics, which topped the 2018 preference list for high school candidates.

Higher education includes four of the five highest-ranking national universities – Sofia University (SU), the Technical University of Sofia, New Bulgarian University, and the Medical University of Sofia. Sofia University was founded in 1888. More than 20,000 students study in its 16 faculties. A number of research and cultural departments operate within SU, including its own publishing house, botanical gardens, a space research centre, a quantum electronics department, and a Confucius Institute. Rakovski Defence and Staff College, the National Academy of Arts, the University of Architecture, Civil Engineering and Geodesy, the University of National and World Economy, and the University of Mining and Geology are other major higher education establishments in the city.

Other institutions of national significance, such as the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences (BAS) and the SS. Cyril and Methodius National Library, are located in Sofia. BAS is the centrepiece of scientific research in Bulgaria, employing more than 4,500 scientists in various institutes. Its Institute of Nuclear Research and Nuclear Energy will operate the largest cyclotron in the country. All five of Bulgaria&#x27;s supercomputers and supercomputing clusters are located in Sofia as well. Three of those are operated by the BAS; one by Sofia Tech Park and one by the Faculty of Physics at Sofia University.

<text>St. George&#x27;s (Grenadian Creole French: &quot;Sen Jòj&quot;) is the capital of Grenada. The city is surrounded by a hillside of an old volcano crater and is located on a horseshoe-shaped harbour.

St. George&#x27;s is a popular Caribbean tourist destination. The town has developed in recent years, while preserving its history, culture, and natural environment. The parish in which St George&#x27;s is located, is the home of St. George’s University School of Medicine and Maurice Bishop International Airport. The main exports are cocoa bean (cacao), nutmeg, and mace spice.

It has a moderate tropical climate that ensures the success of spice production. Nutmeg is a key crop, followed by spices such as cocoa, mace, cloves, vanilla, cinnamon and ginger.

== History ==
 
St. George&#x27;s was founded by the French in 1650 when &quot;La Grenade&quot; (Grenada) was colonised by Jacques Dyel du Parquet, the governor of Martinique. The French began their colonisation with a series of skirmishes that virtually exterminated the island&#x27;s native Carib population.

In 1666, a wooden fortification was constructed by French colonists on a promontory overlooking Grenada&#x27;s natural harbour and named &quot;Fort Royale&quot;. In 1705, work started on a new star fort on the same site, with four stone-built bastions, to the design of Jean de Giou de Caylus, the Chief Engineer of the &quot;Islands of America&quot; the French West Indies. It was completed in 1710.

Meanwhile, the original colonial settlement at the eastern edge of the harbour called &quot;Saint Louis&quot; after King Louis IX of France, later known as Port Louis, was found to be subject to flooding and malaria, so a new town was constructed called &quot;Ville de Fort Royal&quot; (&quot;Fort Royal Town&quot;). When the island was ceded to Great Britain by the Treaty of Paris in 1763, the new administration renamed it Saint George&#x27;s Town, after the patron saint of England and &quot;Fort Royal&quot; was renamed Fort George, after King George III. On 1 November 1775 there was a fire in the town of St. George&#x27;s known as the great fire of St George&#x27;s. After the great fire of 1771, most of the boarding houses on Granby Street were moved to Gouyave.

Following the withdrawal of Bridgetown, Barbados, in the mid-1880s, St. George&#x27;s went on to become the replacement capital of the former colony of the British Windward Islands.

The Tikal was the first art cater shop in Grenada and it was opened in December 1959. Grenada achieved independence from Britain in 1974. Following a leftist coup in 1983, the island was invaded by U. S. troops and a pro-USA government was reinstated. In 2004, St. George&#x27;s and the rest of Grenada was severely battered by Hurricane Ivan. The hurricane left significant destruction across the island and crippled much of the island&#x27;s infrastructure. It was estimated that some 90% of the island&#x27;s homes had sustained damage and the nutmeg trees, which are key to Grenada&#x27;s economy, were devastated. A year later with the help of international donors (Canada, the United States, China, Venezuela, Trinidad &amp; Tobago, and the European Union) Grenada had experienced a significant turn around in rebuilding efforts. By 2007, Grenada had participated as planned in the hosting of the 2007 Cricket World Cup. Now St. George&#x27;s is one of the top 10 Yacht destinations.

== Culture ==
Carnival takes place the second week in August. This festival celebrates the emancipation of slaves. The Sunday night celebrations continue into the early morning hours on Monday. On Monday a carnival pageant is held on stage at Queen&#x27;s Park, where costumes, themes and calypso queens are judged. On Tuesday, St. George&#x27;s vibrates to the sounds of the calypso steel bands as they parade through the streets.

== Climate ==
St. George&#x27;s has a humid tropical marine climate but has the influences of a tropical rainforest climate, with a wet season (June to November) and a noticeably dry season (December to May). St. George&#x27;s sees frequent thunderstorms and occasional hurricanes from easterlies, while winter is marginally cooler and somewhat drier. The feeling of heat is exacerbated from the strong equatorial UV rays and high humidity all year. 
==Spices==

=== Nutmeg &amp; mace ===
Nutmeg and mace come from the fruit of the aromatic Myristica fragrans tree. The tree was introduced on 3 March 1967 to the Spice Island. The Nutmeg Tree is an evergreen with dark green leaves and small yellow flowers, and grows up to 12 meters tall. It starts bearing fruit after seven or eight years and continues to do so for up to 40 years. The fruit looks like an apricot and when ripe, it splits open to reveal a walnut-sized seed. The seed coverings are lacy, red-orange strips, which are made into mace powder; the seed itself is ground down into nutmeg powder. It is used extensively for cooking to enhance the flavor of cakes, soups, desserts, drinks and sauces.

=== Cinnamon ===
This comes from the inner bark of the cinnamon tree (Cinnamonum verum). Whole or ground, it is a popular household spice internationally. It is used to flavor beverages and cakes.

=== Clove ===
This dried flavored flower bud, whole or ground (Syzygium aromaticum) is used at home to season hams, sausages, meats, mincemeat pies, fish, turtle preserves and pickles.

=== Sugar cane ===
From June to December, cuttings from the tops of cane are laid in holes about deep by then covered with soil. As the cane grows taller, fertiliser is used. Between planting and harvesting, bananas, corn, peas, potatoes, and other crops are cultivated. January to May, the ripe cane are cut and delivered to the mill to be ground. Boiling and clarifying the cane juice is the next operation. The juice is strained after grinding and then taken to the clarifying copper to be boiled. (Wood coal is the main source fuel). Lime is added to speed up the operation. The liquid sugar is put into coolers for about 14 hours. The molasses is then drained off and taken to the still house to be made into rum.

== Main sites ==
=== St. Margaret&#x27;s Falls ===
So named because it passes by seven of Grand Etang&#x27;s mountain waterfalls, which are nestled in the emerald vegetation of the rain forest. The trail takes about three hours, even for experienced hikers.

=== Roman Catholic cathedral ===
The tower of St. George&#x27;s Cathedral was built in 1818. The interior of the church is painted in bright colours.

=== Anglican church ===
St. George&#x27;s Anglican Church was built in 1825, and a clock was later added in 1904 which plays the Westminster chimes on the hour. The church laid in ruin for a decade following heavy damage from Hurricane Ivan in 2004, when it continued to be used informally by locals for both prayer as well as school classes. Following several years of reconstruction work since the mid-2010s, the building returned to its function as a church.

=== Fort George ===
Located on the promontory to the west of the harbour is Fort George. Built in 1705 by the French, many of the buildings are now used by the police. One of the rooms has been converted to a gym and another to a sort of sewing room. Much of the fort is still intact and open to visitors.

However, the buildings are very dilapidated, from a combination of hurricane damage and neglect, and there is little or no information within the fort itself. There&#x27;s a good view from the battlements. There is a $2.00 per person fee to visit the Fort.

=== Grenada National Museum ===
The Grenada National Museum is housed in French barracks, which date from 1704, and which later served as a prison. The building was also used as the island&#x27;s first hotel. The museum displays a variety of historical items including Carib and Arawak artefacts, sugar processing machines and equipment, whaling industry items, and Josephine Bonaparte&#x27;s marble bath.

=== Other sites ===
* National Cricket Stadium
* St. Georges fresh produce marketplace
* Grande Anse beach, shopping centres, hotels
* Maurice Bishop International Airport (Point(e) Saline)
* Parliament Building, also known as York House, houses the House of Representatives, the Senate, and the Supreme Court

<doc id="57648" wikidata="Q1867" url="?curid=57648" title="Taipei">
<text>Taipei (; ), officially Taipei City, is the capital and a special municipality of Taiwan. Located in Northern Taiwan, Taipei City is an enclave of the municipality of New Taipei City that sits about southwest of the northern port city of Keelung. Most of the city rests on the Taipei Basin, an ancient lakebed. The basin is bounded by the relatively narrow valleys of the Keelung and Xindian rivers, which join to form the Tamsui River along the city&#x27;s western border.

The municipality of Taipei is home to an estimated population of 2,494,813 (March 2023), forming the core part of the Taipei–Keelung metropolitan area, also known as &quot;Greater Taipei&quot;, which includes the nearby cities of New Taipei and Keelung with a population of 7,047,559, the 40th most-populous urban area in the world—roughly one-third of Taiwanese citizens live in the metro areas. The name &quot;Taipei&quot; can refer either to the whole metropolitan area or just the municipality alone. Taipei has been the political center of the island since 1887, when it first became the seat of Taiwan Province by the Qing dynasty until 1895 and again from 1945 to 1956 by the Republic of China (ROC) government, with an interregnum from 1895 to 1945 as the seat of the Government-General of Taiwan during the Japanese rule. The city has been the national seat of the ROC central government since 1949, and it became the nation&#x27;s first special municipality (then known as Yuan-controlled municipality) on 1 July 1967, upgrading from provincial city status.

Taipei is the economic, political, educational and cultural center of Taiwan. It has been rated an &quot;Alpha − City&quot; by GaWC. Taipei also forms a major part of a high-tech industrial area. Railways, highways, airports and bus lines connect Taipei with all parts of the island. The city is served by two airports – Songshan and Taoyuan. The municipality is home to architectural and cultural landmarks, including Taipei 101 (which was formerly the tallest building in the world), Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, Dalongdong Baoan Temple, Hsing Tian Kong, Lungshan Temple of Manka, National Palace Museum, Presidential Office Building, Taipei Guest House and Zhinan Temple. Shopping districts including Ximending as well as several night markets dispersed throughout the city. Natural features include Maokong, Yangmingshan and hot springs.

In English-language news reports, the name &quot;Taipei&quot; often serves as a synecdoche referring to the central government that controls the Taiwan Area. Due to the ambiguous political status of Taiwan internationally, the term &quot;Chinese Taipei&quot; is also frequently used as a synonym for the entire country, as when Taiwan&#x27;s governmental representatives participate in international organizations or when Taiwan&#x27;s athletes compete in international sporting events, including the Olympics.

==Names==
The spellings &quot;Taipei&quot; and &quot;Tʻai-pei&quot; derive from the Wade–Giles romanization &quot;Tʻai²-pei³&quot; which means &quot;the North of Taiwan&quot; in Chinese. The name could be also romanized as &quot;Táiběi&quot; according to Hanyu Pinyin and Tongyong Pinyin.

The city has also been known as &quot;Tai-pak&quot; (derived from Taiwanese Hokkien) and &quot;Taipeh&quot;.

During the Japanese rule from 1895 to 1945, Taipei was known as &quot;Taihoku&quot;, which is the pronunciation of the Chinese characters (Kanji: ) for Taipei in Japanese.

==History==


Prior to the significant influx of Han Chinese colonists, the region of Taipei Basin was mainly inhabited by the plains aborigines called Ketagalan. The number of Han colonists gradually increased in the early 18th century under Qing dynasty rule after the government began permitting development in the area. In 1875, the northern part of the island was incorporated into the new Taipeh Prefecture.

It was formerly established as Taipeh-fu and was the temporary capital of the island in 1887 when it was declared a province (Fukien-Taiwan Province). Taipeh was formally made the provincial capital in 1894. The romanized transcription of Taipeh was changed to Taihoku in 1895 when the Empire of Japan annexed Taiwan, based on the Japanese reading of the two characters. The writing in Chinese characters remained unaltered. Under Japanese rule, the city was administered under Taihoku Prefecture. Taiwan&#x27;s Japanese rulers embarked on an extensive program of advanced urban planning that featured extensive railroad links. A number of Taipei landmarks and cultural institutions date from this period.

Following the surrender of Japan to the Allies during 1945, effective control of Taiwan was handed to the Republic of China (ROC). After facing defeat from Communist forces, the ruling Kuomintang relocated the ROC government to Taiwan and declared Taipei the provisional capital of the ROC in December 1949. Taiwan&#x27;s Kuomintang rulers regarded the city as the capital of Taiwan Province and their control as mandated by General Order No. 1.

In 1990, Taipei provided the backdrop for the Wild Lily student rallies that moved Taiwanese society from one-party rule to multi-party democracy by 1996. The city has served as the seat of Taiwan&#x27;s democratically elected national government ever since.

===Early settlers–Qing dynasty===
Prior to the 18th century, the region known as the Taipei Basin was home to Ketagalan tribes. Han Chinese colonists from Dabu County, Yongding County, Anxi and Tong&#x27;an of Southern Fujian began to settle in the Taipei Basin in 1709.

In the late 19th century, the Taipei area, where the major Han Chinese settlements in northern Taiwan and one of the designated overseas trade ports, Tamsui, were located, gained economic importance due to the booming overseas trade, especially that of tea export. In 1875, the northern part of Taiwan was separated from Taiwan Prefecture and incorporated into the new Taipeh Prefecture as a new administrative entity of the Qing dynasty. Having been established adjoining the flourishing townships of Bangka, Dalongdong, and Twatutia, the new prefectural capital was known as &quot;Chengnei&quot; (), &quot;the inner city&quot;, and government buildings were erected there. From 1875 until the beginning of Japanese rule in 1895, Taipei was part of Tamsui County of Taipeh Prefecture and the prefectural capital.

In 1885, as work commenced to govern the island as a province, Taipeh was thus temporarily designated as a provincial capital. The city officially became the capital in 1894. Nowadays, all that remains from the historical period is the north gate. The west gate and city walls were demolished by the Japanese while the south gate, little south gate, and east gate were extensively modified by the Kuomintang and have lost much of their original character.

===Empire of Japan===

As settlement for losing the First Sino-Japanese War, China ceded the island of Taiwan to the Empire of Japan in 1895 as part of the Treaty of Shimonoseki. After the Japanese takeover, Taipei, romanized into English as Taihoku following the Japanese language pronunciation, was retained as the capital. It subsequently emerged as the political center of the Japanese Colonial Government. During that time the city acquired the characteristics of an administrative center, including many new public buildings and housing for civil servants. Much of the architecture of Taipei dates from the period of Japanese rule, including the Presidential Office Building which was the Office of the Governor-General of Taiwan.

During Japanese rule, Taihoku was incorporated in 1920 as part of Taihoku Prefecture. It included Bangka, Twatutia, and among other small settlements. The eastern village of was annexed into Taihoku City in 1938. Taihoku and surrounding areas were bombed by Allied forces on several occasions. The largest of these Allied air raids, the Taihoku Air Raid, took place on 31 May 1945.

===Post-WW2 under ROC===


Upon the Japanese defeat following the nuclear bomb destruction of Hiroshima and its consequent surrender in August 1945, the Kuomintang (Chinese Nationalist Party) assumed control of Taiwan. Subsequently, Taipei was established as a provincial city and a temporary Office of the Taiwan Province Administrative Governor was established in it. In 1947 the Kuomintang (KMT) government under Chiang Kai-shek declared island-wide martial law in Taiwan as a result of the 28 February Incident, which began with incidents in Taipei but led to an island-wide crackdown on the local population by forces loyal to Chiang. Two years later, on 7 December 1949, Chiang and the Kuomintang forces were forced to flee mainland China after the defeat by Communist revolutionaries. The KMT-led national government that fled to Taiwan declared Taipei to be the provisional capital of a continuing Republic of China.

Taipei expanded greatly in the decades after 1949, and as approved on 30 December 1966, by the Executive Yuan, Taipei was declared a special municipality on 1 July 1967. In the following year, Taipei City expanded again by annexing Shilin, Beitou, Neihu, Nangang, Jingmei, and Muzha. At that time, the city&#x27;s total area increased fourfold by absorbing several outlying towns and villages and the population increased to 1.56 million people.

The city&#x27;s population, which had reached one million in the early 1960s, also expanded rapidly after 1967, exceeding two million by the mid-1970s. Although growth within the city itself gradually slowed thereafter — its population had become relatively stable by the mid-1990s – Taipei remained one of the world&#x27;s most densely populated urban areas, and the population continued to increase in the region surrounding the city, notably along the corridor between Taipei and Keelung.

In 1990, Taipei&#x27;s 16 districts were consolidated into the current 12 districts. Mass democracy rallies that year in the plaza around Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall led to an island-wide transition to multi-party democracy, where legislators are chosen via regularly scheduled popular elections, during the presidency of Lee Teng-Hui.

==Geography==
Taipei City is located in the Taipei Basin in northern Taiwan. It is bordered by the Xindian River on the south and the Tamsui River on the west. The generally low-lying terrain of the central areas on the western side of the municipality slopes upward to the south and east and especially to the north, where it reaches the -tall Qixing Mountain, the highest (dormant) volcano in Taiwan in Yangmingshan National Park. The northern districts of Shilin and Beitou extend north of the Keelung River and are bordered by Yangmingshan National Park. The Taipei city limits cover an area of , ranking sixteenth of twenty-five among all counties and cities in Taiwan.

Two peaks, Qixing Mountain and Mt. Datun, rise to the northeast of the city. Qixing Mountain is located on the Tatun Volcanic Group; its -high main peak renders it the tallest mountain at the rim of the Taipei Basin; -high Mt. Datun is a close runner up. These former volcanoes make up the western section of Yangmingshan National Park, extending from Mt. Datun northward to Mt. Caigongkeng (). Located on a broad saddle between two mountains, the area also contains the marshy Datun Pond.

To the southeast of the city lie the Songshan Hills and the Qingshui Ravine, which form a barrier of lush woods.

===Climate===
Taipei has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfa&quot;). Summers are long-lasting, very hot and humid, and accompanied by occasional heavy rainstorms and typhoons; while winters are short, generally warm and generally very foggy due to the northeasterly winds from the vast Siberian High being intensified by the pooling of this cooler air in the Taipei Basin. As in the rest of Northern Taiwan, daytime temperatures of Taipei can often peak above during a warm winter day, while they can dip below that same level during afternoon showers and thunderstorms in the summer. Occasional cold fronts during the winter months can drop the daily temperature by , though temperatures rarely drop below . Extreme temperatures ranged from on 13 February 1901 to on 24 July 2020, while snow has never been recorded in the city besides on mountains located within the city limit such as Yangmingshan. Due to Taiwan&#x27;s location in the Pacific Ocean, it is affected by the Pacific typhoon season, which occurs between June and October.
===Air quality===
In comparison to other Asian cities, Taipei has &quot;excellent&quot; capabilities for managing air quality in the city. Its rainy climate, location near the coast, and strong environmental regulations have prevented air pollution from becoming a substantial health issue, at least compared to cities in southeast Asia and industrial China. However, smog is extremely common and there is poor visibility throughout the city after rainless days.

Motor vehicle engine exhaust, particularly from motor scooters, is a source of air pollution in Taipei. There are higher levels of fine particulate matter and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the mornings because of less air movement; sunlight reduces some pollution.

==Cityscape==

==Demographics==


While Taipei City is home to 2,524,393 people (2022), the greater metropolitan area has a population of 7,047,559 people. Even though the population of the city has been decreasing in recent years, the population of adjacent New Taipei has been increasing. The population loss, while rapid in its early years, was slowed by lower density development and campaigns designed to increase the birthrate in the city in the 2010s. As a result, the population rose 2010–2015.

Due to Taipei&#x27;s geography and location in the Taipei Basin as well as differing times of settlement and differing degrees of economic development of its districts, Taipei&#x27;s population is not evenly distributed. The districts of Daan, Songshan, and Datong are the most densely populated. These districts, along with adjacent communities such as Yonghe and Zhonghe, contain some of the most densely populated neighborhoods in the world.

In 2008, the crude birth rate stood at 7.88%, while the mortality rate stood at 5.94%. A decreasing and rapidly aging population is an important issue for the city. By the end of 2009, one in ten people in Taipei was over 65 years of age. Residents who had obtained a college education or higher accounted for 43.48% of the population, and the literacy rate stood at 99.18%.

Like the rest of Taiwan, Taipei is composed of four major ethnic subgroups: Hoklos, Waishengren, Hakkas, and aborigines. Although Hoklos and Waishengren form the majority of the population of the city, in recent decades many Hakkas have moved into the city. The aboriginal population in the city stands at 16,713 at the end of 2018 (&lt;1%), concentrated mostly in the suburban districts. Foreigners (mainly from Indonesia, the Philippines, and Japan) numbered 71,858 at the end of 2022.
==Economy==

As Taiwan&#x27;s business, financial, and technology hub, Taipei has been at the center of rapid economic development in the country and has now become one of the global cities in technology and electronics. This development is part of the so-called Taiwan Economic Miracle which has seen dramatic growth in the city following foreign direct investment in the 1960s. Taiwan is now a creditor economy, holding one of the world&#x27;s largest foreign exchange reserves of over US$403 billion as of December 2012.

Despite the Asian financial crisis, the economy continues to expand at about 5% per year, with virtually full employment and low inflation. The city&#x27;s GDP stand at US$327 billion in 2014. , the nominal GDP per capita in Taipei city is 5th highest in East Asia, behind Tokyo, Singapore, Osaka, and Hong Kong, but ahead of Seoul, as well as London and Paris, according to &quot;The Economist&quot;. GDP per capita based on Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) in Taipei in 2015 was US$44,173, behind that of Singapore (US$90,151 in 2016 from the IMF) and Hong Kong (US$58,322 in 2016 from the IMF; also based on PPP). The &quot;Financial Times&quot; ranked Taipei highly in economic potential (2nd, behind Tokyo) and business friendliness (4th) in 2015. The city is home to 30 billionaires, the 16th most in the world, ahead of many global cities such as Los Angeles and Sydney. Business Insider also ranks Taipei the 5th most high-tech city globally, the highest in Asia, in 2017. While the IESE Cities in Motion Index 2017 ranks Taipei as the smartest technology city globally.

Taipei&#x27;s main development fields include the information and communications technology (hardware and software), biotechnology, general merchandizing (wholesale/retail), financial services, and MICE industries. Most of the country&#x27;s major firms are based there including Acer Computers, Asus, CTBC Bank, Fubon Financial Holding, Tatung Company, D-Link, and others. 5 Global Fortune 500 companies are headquartered in Taipei. The city also attracts many multi-national corporations, international financial institutions, foreign consulates, and business organizations to set up base there. Thus, Taipei has nearly 3,500 registered foreign businesses and attracts over 50% of the total foreign investment in Taiwan. Foreign companies with offices or regional headquarters in Taipei include Google, Microsoft, IBM, Intel, HSBC, Citibank, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, JP Morgan, PwC, and many others. Most financial and foreign firms like to reside in the central business district of Taipei, the Xinyi Special District: Citi, JP Morgan, DBS Bank, Cathay Life Insurance, Shin Kong Commercial Bank, and Hua Nan Bank have all established skyscrapers in the area. Meanwhile, technology and electronics companies are often co-located in the Neihu Technology Park or the Nankang Software Park. The startup and innovation scene in Taipei is also very vibrant. In 2018 alone, Microsoft announced plans to invest US$34 million to create an artificial intelligence R&amp;D center in Taipei, while Google announced it will hire 300 people and train 5,000 more in artificial intelligence for machines. Taipei is Google&#x27;s biggest engineering site in Asia. IBM also announced in 2018 that it will develop a cloud research lab and expand its R&amp;D center in Taipei with eyes on artificial intelligence, blockchain technology, and cloud computing. According to the 2016 Global Entrepreneurship Development Index, Taipei&#x27;s entrepreneurial spirit ranks 6th worldwide and 1st in Asia. Taipei has more than 400 startups and numerous incubation centers, accelerators, venture capitals, and angel investors. The city&#x27;s startup ecosystem is valued at US$580 million by Startup Genome in 2018.

Tourism is a small but significant component of the local economy with international visitors totaling almost 3 million in 2008. Taipei has many top tourist attractions and contributes a significant amount to the US$6.8 billion tourism industry in Taiwan.

==Culture==
===Tourism===

Tourism is a major part of Taipei&#x27;s economy. In 2013, over 6.3 million overseas visitors visited Taipei, making the city the 15th most visited globally. The influx of visitors contributed US$10.8 billion to the city&#x27;s economy in 2013, the 9th highest in the world and the most of any city in the Chinese-speaking world.

====Commemorative sites and museums====




The National Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall is a monument, landmark and tourist attraction that was erected in memory of General Chiang Kai-shek, former President of the Republic of China. The structure stands at the east end of Memorial Hall Square, site of the National Concert Hall and National Theater and their adjacent parks as well as the memorial. The landmarks of Liberty Square stand within sight of Taiwan&#x27;s Presidential Office Building in Taipei&#x27;s Zhongzheng District.
The National Taiwan Museum sits nearby in what is now 228 Peace Memorial Park and has worn its present name since 1999. The museum is Taiwan&#x27;s oldest, founded on 24 October 1908 by Taiwan&#x27;s Japanese colonial government (1895–1945) as the Taiwan Governor&#x27;s Museum. It was launched with a collection of 10,000 items to celebrate the opening of the island&#x27;s North–South Railway. In 1915 a new museum building opened its doors in what is now 228 Peace Memorial Park. This structure and the adjacent governor&#x27;s office (now Presidential Office Building), served as the two most recognizable public buildings in Taiwan during its period of Japanese rule.

The National Palace Museum is a vast art gallery and museum built around a permanent collection centered on ancient Chinese artifacts. It should not be confused with the Palace Museum in Beijing (which it is named after); both institutions trace their origins to the same institution. The collections were divided in the 1940s as a result of the Chinese Civil War. The National Palace Museum in Taipei now boasts a truly international collection while housing one of the world&#x27;s largest collections of artifacts from ancient China.

The Shung Ye Museum of Formosan Aborigines stands just across the road from the National Palace Museum. The museum offers displays of art and historical items by Taiwanese aborigines along with a range of multimedia displays.

The Taipei Fine Arts Museum was established in 1983 as the first museum in Taiwan dedicated to modern art. The museum is housed in a building designed for the purpose that takes inspiration from Japanese designs. Most art in the collection is by Taiwanese artists since 1940. Over 3,000 art works are organized into 13 groups.

The National Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall near Taipei 101 in Xinyi District is named in honor of a founding father of the Republic of China, Sun Yat-sen. The hall, completed on 16 May 1972, originally featured exhibits that depicted revolutionary events in the Republican period of China. Today it functions as multi-purpose social, educational, concert and cultural center for Taiwan&#x27;s citizens.
In 2001 a new museum opened as Museum of Contemporary Art Taipei. The museum is housed in a building that formerly housed Taipei City government offices.

====Taipei 101====
Taipei 101 is a 101-floor landmark skyscraper that claimed the title of world&#x27;s tallest building when it opened in 2004, a title it held for six years before the Burj Khalifa in Dubai was completed. Designed by C.Y. Lee &amp; Partners and constructed by KTRT Joint Venture, Taipei 101 measures from ground to top, making it the first skyscraper in the world to break the half-kilometer mark in height. Built to withstand typhoon winds and earthquake tremors, its design incorporates many engineering innovations and has won numerous international awards. Today, the Taipei 101 remains one of the tallest skyscrapers in the world and holds LEED&#x27;s certification as the world&#x27;s largest &quot;green&quot; building. Its shopping mall and its indoor and outdoor observatories draws visitors from all over the world. Taipei 101&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Eve fireworks display is a regular feature of international broadcasts.

====Performing arts====
The National Theater and Concert Hall stand at Taipei&#x27;s Liberty Square and host events by foreign and domestic performers. Other leading concert venues include Zhongshan Hall at Ximending and the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall near Taipei 101.

A new venue, the Taipei Performing Arts Center opened in 2022. The venue is near the Shilin Night Market and houses three theaters for events with multi-week runs. The architectural design, by Rem Koolhaas and OMA, was determined in 2009 in an international competition. The same design process is also in place for a new Taipei Center for Popular Music and Taipei City Museum.

====Shopping and recreation====

Taipei is known for its many night markets, which include the Shilin Night Market in the Shilin District. The surrounding streets by Shilin Night Market are extremely crowded during the evening, usually opening late afternoon and operating well past midnight. Most night markets feature individual stalls selling a mixture of food, clothing, and consumer goods.

Ximending has been an area for shopping and entertainment since the 1930s. Historic structures include a concert hall, a historic cinema, and the Red House Theater. Modern structures house karaoke businesses, art film cinemas, wide-release movie cinemas, electronic stores, and a wide variety of restaurants and fashion clothing stores. The pedestrian area is especially popular with teens and has been called the &quot;Harajuku&quot; of Taipei.

The newly developed Xinyi District is popular with tourists and locals alike for its many entertainment and shopping venues, as well as being the home of Taipei 101, a prime tourist attraction. Malls in the area include the sprawling Shin Kong Mitsukoshi complex, Breeze Center, Bellavita, Taipei 101 mall, Eslite Bookstore&#x27;s flagship store (which includes a boutique mall), The Living Mall, ATT shopping mall, and the Vieshow Cinemas (formerly known as Warner Village). The Xinyi district also serves as the center of Taipei&#x27;s active nightlife, with several popular lounge bars and nightclubs concentrated in a relatively small area around the Neo19, ATT 4 FUN and Taipei 101 buildings.

The thriving shopping area around Taipei Main Station includes the Taipei Underground Market and the original Shin Kong Mitsukoshi department store at Shin Kong Life Tower. Other popular shopping destinations include the Zhongshan Metro Mall, Dihua Street and the Guang Hua Digital Plaza. The Miramar Entertainment Park is known for its large Ferris wheel and IMAX theater.

Taipei maintains an extensive system of parks, green spaces, and nature preserves. Parks and forestry areas of note in and around the city include Yangmingshan National Park, Taipei Zoo and Da-an Forest Park. Located north of the city center, Yangmingshan National Park is visited for its cherry blossoms, hot springs, and sulfur deposits. It is the home of writer Lin Yutang, the summer residence of Chiang Kai-shek, residences of foreign diplomats, the Chinese Culture University, the meeting place of the now defunct National Assembly of the Republic of China, and the Kuomintang Party Archives. The Taipei Zoo was founded in 1914 and covers an area of 165 hectares for animal sanctuary.

Bitan is known for boating and water sports. Tamsui is a popular sea-side resort town. Ocean beaches are accessible in several directions from Taipei.

====Temples====
Taipei has a variety of temples dedicating to Deities from Chinese folk religion, Taoism and Chinese Buddhism. The Bangka Lungshan Temple (), built in 1738 and located in the Wanhua District, demonstrates an example of architecture with southern Chinese influences commonly seen on older buildings in Taiwan. Qingshui Temple () built in 1787 and Qingshan Temple () together with Lungshan Temple are the three most prominent landmark temples in Bangka or Wanhua District.

Other temples include Baoan Temple () located in historic Dalongdong, a national historical site, and Xia Hai City God Temple (), located in the old Dadaocheng community, constructed with architecture similar to temples in southern Fujian. The Taipei Confucius Temple () traces its history back to 1879 during the Qing dynasty and also incorporates southern Fujian-style architecture. Ciyou Temple () in Songshan District, Guandu Temple () in Beitou District, Hsing Tian Kong () in Zhongshan District and Zhinan Temple () in Wenshan District are also popular temples for locals and tourists. Xinsheng South Road is known as the &quot;Road to Heaven&quot; due to its high concentration of temples, churches, and other houses of worship.

The Shandao Temple () built in 1929 and located in Zhongzheng District, is the largest Buddhist temple in Taipei. Fo Guang Shan has a modern temple known as Fo Guang Shan Taipei Vihara () in Xinyi District, while Dharma Drum Mountain owns the Degui Academy (), an education center in Zhongzheng District and the Nung Chan Monastery () in Beitou District. Linji Huguo Chan Temple () in Zhongshan District was commenced in 1900 and completed in 1911, it is one of the very few Japanese style Buddhist Temples that was well-preserved in Taiwan.

Besides large temples, small outdoor shrines to local deities are very common and are commonly found next to roads as well as in parks and neighborhoods. Many homes and businesses may also set up small shrines of candles, figurines, and offerings. Some restaurants, for example, may set up a small shrine to the Kitchen God for success in a restaurant business.

===Festivals and events===

Many yearly festivals are held in Taipei. In recent years some festivals, such as the Double Ten Day fireworks and concerts, are increasingly hosted on a rotating basis by a number of cities around Taiwan.

When New Year&#x27;s Eve arrives on the solar calendar, thousands of people converge on Taipei&#x27;s Xinyi District for parades, outdoor concerts by popular artists, street shows, round-the clock nightlife. The high point is the countdown to midnight, when Taipei 101 assumes the role of the world&#x27;s largest fireworks platform.

The Taipei Lantern Festival concludes the Lunar New Year holiday. The timing of the city&#x27;s lantern exhibit coincides with the national festival in Pingxi, when thousands of fire lanterns are released into the sky. The city&#x27;s lantern exhibit rotates among different downtown locales from year to year, including Liberty Square, Taipei 101, and Zhongshan Hall in Ximending.

On Double Ten Day, patriotic celebrations are held in front of the Presidential Office Building. Other annual festivals include Ancestors Day (Tomb-Sweeping Day), the Dragon Boat Festival, the Zhong Yuan Festival, and the Mid-Autumn Festival (Mooncake Festival). Qing Shan King Sacrificial Ceremony () is a century-old grand festival that is held annually in Wanhua District.

Taipei regularly hosts its share of international events. The city recently hosted the 2009 Summer Deaflympics. This event was followed by the Taipei International Flora Exposition, a garden festival hosted from November 2010 to April 2011. The Floral Expo was the first of its kind to take place in Taiwan and only the seventh hosted in Asia; the expo admitted 110,000 visitors on 27 February 2011.

==Government==

Taipei City is a special municipality which is directly under the Executive Yuan (Central Government). The mayor of Taipei City was an appointed position since Taipei&#x27;s conversion to a centrally administered municipality in 1967 until the first public election was held in 1994. The position has a four-year term and is elected by direct popular vote. The first elected mayor was Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic Progressive Party. Ma Ying-jeou took office in 1998 for two terms, before handing it over to Hau Lung-pin who won the 2006 mayoral election on 9 December 2006. Both Chen Shui-bian and Ma Ying-Jeou went on to become President of the Republic of China. 
The incumbent mayor, Chiang Wan-an of Kuomintang, took office on 25 December 2022.

Based on the outcomes of previous elections in the past decade, the vote of the overall constituency of Taipei City shows a slight inclination towards the pro-KMT camp (the Pan-Blue Coalition); however, the pro-DPP camp (the Pan-Green Coalition) also has considerable support.

Ketagalan Boulevard, where the Presidential Office Building and other government structures are situated, is often the site of mass gatherings such as inauguration and national holiday parades, receptions for visiting dignitaries, political demonstrations, and public festivals.

===Garbage recycling===
Taipei City strongly promotes garbage recycling, with such success that other countries have sent teams to study the recycling system. After the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) established a program in 1998 combining the efforts of communities, a financial resource named the Recycling Fund was made available to recycling companies and waste collectors. The EPA also introduced garbage recycling trucks, in effort to raise community recycling awareness, that broadcast classical music (specifically Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Für Elise&quot; and Tekla Bądarzewska-Baranowska&#x27;s &quot;A Maiden&#x27;s Prayer&quot;) to announce its arrival to the community. Manufacturers, vendors and importers of recyclable waste pay fees to the Fund, which uses the money to set firm prices for recyclables and subsidize local recycling efforts. Between 1998 and 2008, the recycling rate increased from 6 percent to 32 percent. This improvement enabled the government of Taipei to demonstrate its recycling system to the world at the Shanghai World Expo 2010.

===Administrative divisions===
Taipei City is divided up into 12 administrative districts (). Each district is further divided up into urban villages (), which are further sub-divided up into neighborhoods (). Xinyi District is the seat of the municipality where the Taipei City Government headquarters is located.
===City planning===
The city is characterized by straight roads and public buildings of grand Western architectural styles. The city is built on a square grid configuration; however, these blocks are huge by international standards with sides. The area in between these blocks is infilled with lanes and alleys, which provide access to quieter residential or mixed-use development. Other than a citywide speed limit, there is little uniform planning within this &quot;hidden&quot; area; therefore, lanes (perpendicular to streets) and alleys (parallel with streets, or, conceptually, perpendicular to lanes) spill out from the main controlled-access highways. These minor roads are not always perpendicular and sometimes cut through the block diagonally.

Although development began in the western districts of the city (still considered the cultural heart of Taipei) due to trade, the eastern districts have become the focus of recent development projects. Many of the western districts have become targets of urban renewal initiatives.

==Transportation==

Public transport accounts for a substantial portion of transportation trips in Taipei. According to a 2022 government survey, 34.9% of transportation trips were taken on public transit in Taipei, higher than any other locality in the country. Private transport consists of motor scooters, private cars, taxi cabs and bicycles. Private transport trips represented 41.6% of trips taken in Taipei in 2022, the lowest in Taiwan.

Taipei Main Station serves as the comprehensive hub for the subway, bus, conventional rail, and high-speed rail. A contactless smartcard, known as EasyCard, can be used for all modes of public transit as well as several retail outlets. It contains credits that are deducted each time a ride is taken. The EasyCard is read via MIFARE panels on buses and in MRT stations, and it does not need to be removed from one&#x27;s wallet or purse.

===Metro===

Taipei&#x27;s public transport system, the Taipei Metro (commonly referred to as the MRT), incorporates a metro and light rail system based on advanced VAL and Bombardier technology. There are currently six metro lines that are organized and labeled in three ways: by color, line number and depot station name. In addition to the rapid transit system itself, the Taipei Metro also includes several public facilities such as the Maokong Gondola, underground shopping malls, parks, and public squares. Modifications to existing railway lines to integrate them into the metro system are underway.

In 2017 a rapid transit line was opened to connect Taipei with Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport and Zhongli District. The new line is part of the new Taoyuan Metro system.

On 31 January 2020, Hitachi Rail Corporation officially commissioned Phase 1 of the Circular line which took place at Shisizhang station. The Circular line is a 15.4 km driverless rail system. The Circular line offered free rides beginning in February 2020 for passengers to test the route.

===Rail===

Beginning in 1983, surface rail lines in the city were moved underground as part of the Taipei Railway Underground Project. The Taiwan High Speed Rail system opened in 2007. The bullet trains connect Taipei with the west coast cities of New Taipei, Taoyuan, Hsinchu, Taichung, Chiayi, and Tainan before terminating at Zuoying (Kaohsiung) at speeds that cut travel times by 60% or more from what they normally are on a bus or conventional train. The Taiwan Railways Administration also runs passenger and freight services throughout the entire island.

===Bus===

An extensive city bus system serves metropolitan areas not covered by the metro, with exclusive bus lanes to facilitate transportation. Riders of the city metro system are able to use the EasyCard for discounted fares on buses, and vice versa. A unique feature of the Taipei bus system is the joint venture of private transportation companies that operate the system&#x27;s routes while sharing the fare system. This route is in sharp contrast to bus systems in the U.S. which are mostly public entities. Several major intercity bus terminals are located throughout the city, including the Taipei Bus Station and Taipei City Hall Bus Station.
===Airports===

Most scheduled international flights are served by Taoyuan International Airport in nearby Taoyuan City. Songshan Airport, at the heart of the city in the Songshan District, serves domestic flights and scheduled flights to Haneda Airport in Tokyo, Gimpo International Airport in Seoul, and about 15 destinations in the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Songshan Airport is accessible by the Taipei Metro Neihu Line; Taoyuan International Airport is accessible by the Taoyuan Airport MRT.

===Ticketing===
In 1994, following the rapid development of Taipei, a white paper for transport policies expressed the strong objective of creating a transport system for the people of Taipei to accommodate the burgeoning city&#x27;s needs. In 1999, they chose Mitac consortium, which Thales-Transportation Systems is part of. Thales was then selected again in 2005 to deploy an upgrade of Taipei&#x27;s public transport network with an end-to-end and fully contactless automatic fare collection solution that integrates 116 metro stations, 5,000 buses and 92 car parks.

==Education==
Taipei is home to the campuses of 24 universities and Academia Sinica, Taiwan&#x27;s national academy which supports the Taiwan International Graduate Program:

National Taiwan University (NTU or &quot;Tai-Da&quot;) was established in 1928 during the period of Japanese colonial rule. NTU has produced many political and social leaders in Taiwan. Both pan-blue and pan-green movements in Taiwan are rooted on the NTU campus. The university has six campuses in the greater Taipei region (including New Taipei) and two additional campuses in Nantou County. The university governs farms, forests, and hospitals for educational and research purposes. The main campus is in Taipei&#x27;s Da-An district, where most department buildings and all the administrative buildings are located. The College of Law and the College of Medicine are located near the Presidential Office Building. The National Taiwan University Hospital is a leading international center of medical research.

National Taiwan Normal University (NTNU or &quot;Shi-Da&quot;) likewise traces its origins to the Japanese colonial period. Founded as Taihoku College in 1922 and organized as a teacher training institution by the Kuomintang in 1946, NTNU has since developed into a comprehensive international university. The university boasts especially strong programs in the humanities and international education. Worldwide it is perhaps best known as home of the Mandarin Training Center, a program that offers Mandarin language training each year to over a thousand students from scores of countries throughout the world. The main campus, in Taipei&#x27;s Daan district near MRT Guting Station, is known for its historic architecture. The Shida market area surrounding this campus takes its name from the school&#x27;s acronym.

==Sports==

Wei Chuan Dragons of Taiwan&#x27;s Chinese Professional Baseball League is a professional baseball team based in Taipei. The Taipei Highwealth team of the Popcorn League is also based in Taipei, co-sponsored by the Taipei City Government and Highwealth Construction.

<text>Tehran (; , &quot;Tehrân&quot;) is the capital and largest city of Iran. In addition to serving as the capital of Tehran province, the city is the administrative center for Tehran County and its Central District. With a population of around 9.8 million in the city as of 2025, and 16.8 million in the metropolitan area, Tehran is the most populous city in Iran and Western Asia, the second-largest metropolitan area in the Middle East after Cairo, and the 24th most populous metropolitan area in the world. Greater Tehran includes several municipalities, including, Karaj, Eslamshahr, Shahriar, Qods, Malard, Golestan, Pakdasht, Qarchak, Nasimshahr, Parand, Pardis, Andisheh and Fardis.

In the classical antiquity, part of the territory of present-day Tehran was occupied by Rhages (now Ray), a prominent Median city almost entirely destroyed in the medieval Arab, Turkic, and Mongol invasions. Modern Ray was absorbed into the metropolitan area of Greater Tehran.

Tehran was first chosen as the capital of Iran by Agha Mohammad Khan of the Qajar dynasty in 1786, because of its proximity to Iran&#x27;s territories in the Caucasus, then separated from Iran in the Russo-Iranian Wars, to avoid the vying factions of the previously ruling Iranian dynasties. The capital has been moved several times throughout history, however, and Tehran became the 32nd capital of Iran. Large-scale construction works began in the 1920s, and Tehran became a destination for mass migrations from all over Iran since the 20th century.

Tehran is home to many historical sites, including the World Heritage Site Golestan Palace of Qajar dynasty and Sa&#x27;dabad, Niavaran and Marmar Palace of Pahlavi dynasty. Tehran&#x27;s landmarks include the Azadi Tower, a memorial built in 1971 to mark the 2,500th anniversary of the Persian Empire, the Milad Tower, the world&#x27;s sixth-tallest self-supporting tower, completed in 2007, another famous landmark in Tehran is the Tabiat Bridge, completed in 2014.

Most of the population are Persian, with roughly 99% of them speaking the Persian language, alongside other ethnolinguistic groups in the city which became Persianised and assimilated.

Tehran is served by Imam Khomeini International Airport, alongside the domestic Mehrabad Airport, a central railway station, Tehran Metro, a bus rapid transit system, trolleybuses, and a large network of highways.

Plans to relocate the capital from Tehran to another area due to air pollution and earthquakes have not been approved so far. A 2016 survey of 230 cities across the globe by Mercer ranked Tehran 203rd for quality of life. According to the Global Destinations Cities Index in 2016, Tehran is among the top ten fastest growing destinations. In 2016, the Tehran City Council declared 6 October to be Tehran Day, celebrating the date in 1907 when the city officially became the capital of Iran.

== Etymology ==
Various theories on the origin of the name Tehran have been put forward.

Iranian linguist Ahmad Kasravi, in an article &quot;Shemiran-Tehran&quot;, suggested that Tehran and Kehran mean &quot;the warm place&quot;, and &quot;Shemiran&quot; means &quot;the cool place&quot;. He listed cities with the same base and suffix and studied the components of the word in ancient Iranian languages, and came to the conclusion that Tehran and Kehran meant the same thing in different Iranian language families, as the constant &quot;t&quot; and &quot;k&quot; are close to each other in such languages. He also provided evidence that cities named &quot;Shemiran&quot; were colder than those named &quot;Tehran&quot; or &quot;Kehran&quot;. He considered other theories not considering the ancient history of Iranian languages such as &quot;Tirgan&quot; theory and &quot;Tahran&quot; theory folk etymology.

Another theory is that &quot;Tehran&quot; derives from Tiran/Tirgan, &quot;the abode of Tir&quot;, the Zoroastrian equivalent of Hermes. The ancient Parthian town of Tiran had a neighbour, Mehran (&quot;abode of Mehr/Mithra&quot;, the Zoroastrian sun/justice angel). Both of these were mere villages in the suburbs of the great city of Ray/Rhages. Mehran still exists as a residential district in Greater Tehran, as well as Ray, which forms the southern suburbs of Tehran. 

The official City of Tehran website says that &quot;Tehran&quot; comes from the Persian words &quot;Tah&quot; meaning &quot;end&quot;, or &quot;bottom&quot;, and &quot;Ran&quot; meaning &quot;[mountain] slope&quot;—literally, the bottom of the mountain (ته کوه), referring to Tehran&#x27;s position at the foot of the Alborz mountains.

===Spelling===
In English, it is also spelt &quot;Teheran&quot;, with both variants being used in books since at least 1800, and &quot;Teheran&quot; being the dominant form from after WWII until shortly before the Islamic Revolution.

== History ==
Archaeological remains from the ancient city of Ray suggest that settlement in Tehran dates back over 6,000 years.

=== Classical era ===
Tehran is in the historical Media region of ( ) in northwestern Iran. By the time of the Median Empire, part of present-day Tehran was a suburb of the prominent Median city of Rhages ( ). In the Avesta&#x27;s &quot;Videvdat&quot; (i, 15), Rhages is mentioned as the 12th sacred place created by Ohrmazd. In Old Persian inscriptions, Rhages appears as a province (Bistun 2, 10–18). From Rhages, Darius I sent reinforcements to his father Hystaspes, who was putting down a rebellion in Parthia (Bistun 3, 1–10). Some Middle Persian texts give Rhages as the birthplace of Zoroaster, although modern historians generally place the birth of Zoroaster in Khorasan province.

Mount Damavand, the highest peak of Iran, which is located near Tehran, is an important location in Ferdowsi&#x27;s &quot;Šāhnāme&quot;, an Iranian epic poem based on the ancient legends of Iran. It appears in the epics as the homeland of the protoplast Keyumars, the birthplace of King Manuchehr, the place where King Fereydun bound the dragon fiend Aždahāk (Bivarasp), and the place where Arash shot his arrow.

=== Medieval period ===
In 641, during the reign of the Sasanian Empire, Yazdgerd III issued his last appeal to the nation from Rhages, before fleeing to Khorasan. Rhages was dominated by the Parthian House of Mihran, and Siyavakhsh—the son of Mehran, the son of Bahram Chobin—who resisted the seventh-century Muslim invasion of Iran. Because of this resistance, when the Arabs captured Rhages, they ordered the town destroyed and rebuilt anew by traitor aristocrat Farrukhzad.

In the ninth century, Tehran was a well-known village, but less so than the city of Rhages, flourishing nearby. Rhages was described in detail by tenth-century Muslim geographers. Despite the interest that Arabian Baghdad displayed in Rhages, the number of Arabs in the city remained insignificant and the population mainly consisted of Iranians of all classes.

The Oghuz Turks invaded Rhages in 1035, and again in 1042, but the city was recovered under the Seljuks and the Khwarezmians. Medieval writer Najm od Din Razi declared the population of Rhages about 500,000 before the Mongol invasion. In the 13th century, the Mongols invaded Rhages, laid the city to ruins, and massacred many of its inhabitants. Others escaped to Tehran.

In July 1404, Castilian ambassador Ruy González de Clavijo visited Tehran on a journey to Samarkand, the capital of Turco-Mongol conqueror Timur, the ruler of Iran at the time. He described it in his diary as an unwalled region.

=== Early modern era ===
Italian traveler Pietro della Valle passed through Tehran overnight in 1618, and in his memoirs called the city &quot;Taheran&quot;. English traveler Thomas Herbert entered Tehran in 1627, and mentioned it as &quot;Tyroan&quot;. Herbert stated that the city had about 3,000 houses.
In the early 18th century, Karim Khan of the Zand dynasty ordered a palace and a government office built in Tehran, possibly to declare the city his capital; but he later moved his government to Shiraz. Eventually, Qajar king Agha Mohammad Khan chose Tehran as the capital of Iran in 1786.

Agha Mohammad Khan&#x27;s choice of his capital was based on a similar concern for the control of both northern and southern Iran. He was aware of the loyalties of the inhabitants of former capitals Isfahan and Shiraz to the Safavid and Zand dynasties respectively, and was wary of the power of the local notables in these cities. Thus, he probably viewed Tehran&#x27;s lack of a substantial urban structure as a blessing, because it minimized the chances of resistance to his rule by the notables and by the general public. Moreover, he had to remain within close reach of Azerbaijan and Iran&#x27;s integral northern and southern Caucasian territories—at that time not yet irrevocably lost per the treaties of Golestan and Turkmenchay to the neighboring Russian Empire—which would follow in the course of the 19th century.

After 50 years of Qajar rule, the city still barely had more than 80,000 inhabitants. Up until the 1870s, Tehran consisted of a walled citadel, a roofed bazaar, and the three main neighborhoods of Udlajan, Chale-Meydan, and Sangelaj, where the majority resided.

During the long reign of Naser al-Din Shah (1848-1896), Tehran witnessed Iran&#x27;s first institute of higher learning, bank, railway line and museum. The city expanded rapidly through multiple development plans The first development plan of Tehran in 1855 emphasized traditional spatial structure. The second, under the supervision of Dar ol Fonun in 1878, included new city walls, in the form of a perfect octagon with an area of 19 square kilometers, mimicking the Renaissance cities of Europe. Tehran was 19.79 square kilometers, and had expanded more than fourfold.

=== Late modern era ===

Growing awareness of civil rights resulted in the Constitutional Revolution and the first constitution of Iran in 1906. On 2 June 1907, the parliament passed a law on local governance known as the &quot;Baladie&quot; (municipal law), providing a detailed outline of issues such as the role of councils within the city, the members&#x27; qualifications, the election process, and the requirements to be entitled to vote. The then-Qajar monarch Mohammad Ali Shah abolished the constitution and bombarded the parliament with the help of the Russian-controlled Cossack Brigade on 23 June 1908. That was followed by the capture of the city by the revolutionary forces of Ali-Qoli Khan (Sardar Asad II) and Mohammad Vali Khan (Sepahsalar e Tonekaboni) on 13 July 1909. As a result, the monarch was exiled and replaced by his son Ahmad, and the parliament was re-established.

==== World War I ====
During the Persian campaign, Russian forces that were occupying the northwest of Iran marched around Qazvin and approached Tehran, caused a crisis and the dissolution of parliament. Ahmad Shah Qajar and his entourage decided to leave Tehran and move the capital to another place, sparking fears of rebellion in other cities.

During the Battle of Robat Karim, Iranian forces led by Heydar Latifiyan prevented the Russians from taking Tehran, despite the latter winning the battle. This also allowed government functions to be moved to Qom and then to Isfahan, while the monarchy remained in Tehran.

==== Pahlavi rule ====

After World War I, the constituent assembly elected Reza Shah of the Pahlavi dynasty as the new monarch, who immediately suspended the Baladie law of 1907, replacing the decentralized and autonomous city councils with centralist approaches to governance and planning.

From the 1920s to the 1930s, under the rule of Reza Shah, the city was essentially rebuilt from scratch. Several old buildings, including parts of the Golestan Palace, Tekye Dowlat, and Tupkhane Square, were replaced with modern buildings influenced by classical Iranian architecture, particularly the buildings of the National Bank, the police headquarters, the telegraph office, and the military academy.

Changes to the urban fabric began with the street-widening act of 1933, which served as a framework for changes in all other cities. The Grand Bazaar was divided in half and many historic buildings were demolished and replaced by wide straight avenues, and the traditional texture of the city was replaced with intersecting cruciform streets that created large roundabouts in major public spaces such as the bazaar.

As an attempt to create a network for easy transportation within the city, the old citadel and city walls were demolished in 1937, replaced by wide streets cutting through the urban fabric. The new city map of Tehran in 1937 was heavily influenced by modernist planning patterns of zoning and gridiron networks.

During World War II, Soviet and British troops entered the city. In 1943, Tehran was the site of the Tehran Conference, attended by U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin, and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill.

The establishment of the planning organization of Iran in 1948 resulted in the first socioeconomic development plan to cover from 1949 to 1955. These plans not only failed to slow the unbalanced growth of Tehran but with the 1962 land reforms that Reza Shah&#x27;s son and successor Mohammad Reza Shah named the &quot;White Revolution&quot;, Tehran&#x27;s chaotic growth was further accentuated.

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Tehran developed rapidly under Mohammad Reza Shah. Modern buildings altered the face of Tehran and ambitious projects were planned for the following decades. To resolve the problem of social exclusion, the first comprehensive plan was approved in 1968. The consortium of Iranian architect Abd-ol-Aziz Farmanfarmaian and the American firm of Victor Gruen Associates identified the main problems blighting the city as high-density suburbs, air and water pollution, inefficient infrastructure, unemployment, and rural-urban migration. Eventually, the whole plan was marginalized by the 1979 Revolution and the subsequent Iran–Iraq War.
Tehran&#x27;s most famous landmark, the Azadi Tower, was built by the order of the Shah in 1971. It was designed by Hossein Amanat, an architect whose design won a competition, combining elements of classical Sassanian architecture with post-classical Iranian architecture. Formerly known as the &quot;Shahyad Tower&quot;, it was built to commemorate the 2,500th anniversary of the Imperial State of Iran.

===Islamic Republic===
During the Iran–Iraq War in 1980 to 1988, Tehran was repeatedly targeted by airstrikes and Scud missile attacks.

The 435-meter-high Milad Tower, one of the proposed development projects of pre-revolutionary Iran, was completed in 2007, and has become a famous landmark of Tehran. Tabiat Bridge, a 270-meter pedestrian overpass that was designed by award-winning architect Leila Araghian, was completed in 2014.

== Demographics ==


===Population===
The city of Tehran had a population of 7,711,230 in 2,286,787 households at the time of the 2006 National Census. The following census in 2011 counted 8,154,051 people in 2,624,511 households. The 2016 census measured the population of the city as 8,693,706 people in 2,911,065 households.

===Language and ethnicity===
With its cosmopolitan atmosphere, Tehran is home to diverse ethnic and linguistic groups from all over the country. The present-day dominant language of Tehran is the Tehrani variety of the Persian language, and the majority of people in Tehran identify themselves as Persians. However, before, the native language of the Tehran–Ray region was not Persian, which is linguistically Southwest Iranian and originates in Fars, but a now extinct Northwestern Iranian language.

Iranian Azeris form the second-largest ethnic group of the city, comprising about 10-15% of the total population, while ethnic Mazanderanis are the third-largest, comprising about 5% of the total population. Tehran&#x27;s other ethnic communities include Kurds, Armenians, Georgians, Bakhtyaris, Talysh, Baloch, Assyrians, Arabs, Jews, and Circassians.

According to a 2010 census conducted by the Sociology Department of the University of Tehran, in many districts of Tehran across various socio-economic classes in proportion to population sizes of each district and socio-economic class, 63% of the people were born in Tehran, 98% knew Persian, 75% identified themselves as ethnic Persian, and 13% had some degree of proficiency in a European language.

Tehran saw a drastic change in its ethnic-social composition in the early 1980s. After the political, social, and economic consequences of the 1979 Revolution and the years that followed, a number of Iranian citizens, mostly Tehranis, left Iran. The majority of Iranian emigrations have left for the United States, Germany, Sweden, and Canada.

With the start of the Iran–Iraq War (1980–1988), the second wave of inhabitants fled the city, especially during the Iraqi air offensives on the capital. With most major powers backing Iraq at the time, economic isolation gave yet more reason for many inhabitants to leave the city (and the country). Having left all they had and having struggled to adapt to a new country and build a life, most of them never came back when the war was over. During the war, Tehran also received a great number of migrants from the west and the southwest of the country bordering Iraq.

The unstable situation and the war in neighbouring Afghanistan and Iraq prompted a rush of refugees into the country who arrived in millions, with Tehran being a magnet for many seeking work, who subsequently helped the city to recover from war wounds, working for a far lower pay than local construction workers. Many of these refugees are being repatriated with the assistance of the UNHCR, but there are still sizable groups of Afghan and Iraqi refugees in Tehran who are reluctant to leave, being pessimistic about the situation in their own countries. Afghan refugees are mostly Dari-speaking Tajik and Hazara, speaking a variety of Persian, and Iraqi refugees are mainly Mesopotamian Arabic-speakers who are often of Iranian and Persian ethnic heritage.

=== Religion ===

The majority of Tehranis are officially Twelver Shia Muslims, which has also been the state religion since the 16th-century Safavid conversion. Other religious communities in the city include followers of the Sunni and Mystic branches of Islam, various Christian denominations, Judaism, Zoroastrianism, and the Baháʼí Faith.

In the 2016 &quot;Tehran Survey&quot;, when residents of Tehran were asked about the importance of religion in their life, 53.5% considered it to be &quot;very important / important&quot;, 31.1% to be &quot;rather important&quot;, 10.5% to be &quot;not very important&quot; and 4.8% to be &quot;not at all important.&quot;

There are many religious centres scattered around the city, from old to newly built centres, including mosques, churches, synagogues, and Zoroastrian fire temples. The city also has a very small third-generation Indian Sikh community with a local gurdwara that was visited by the Indian Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh in 2012.
== Geography ==

=== Location and subdivisions ===

The metropolis of Tehran is divided into 22 municipal districts, each with its own administrative center. Of the 22 municipal districts, 20 are located in Tehran County&#x27;s Central District, while districts 1 and 20 are respectively located in the counties of Shemiranat and Ray.


Northern Tehran is the wealthiest part of the city, consisting of various districts such as Zafaraniyeh, Jordan, Elahiyeh, Pasdaran, Kamranieh, Ajodanieh, Farmanieh, Darrous, Niavaran, Jamaran, Aghdasieh, Mahmoodieh, Velenjak, Qeytarieh, Ozgol and Ekhtiarieh. While the center of the city houses government ministries and headquarters, commercial centers are located further north.

=== Climate ===

Most of Tehran has a cold semi-arid climate (&quot;BSk&quot;, according to the Köppen climate classification). The climate is &quot;BSh&quot; (hot semi-arid) in the region of the Mehrabad International Airport and cold semi-arid in higher areas, with a borderline Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csa&quot;) in the northern area of the city, with hot, dry summers and cool, rainy winters. Tehran&#x27;s climate is largely defined by its geographic location, with the towering Alborz mountains to its north and the country&#x27;s central desert to the south.

As the city has a large area, with significant differences in elevation among various districts, the weather is often cooler in the hilly north than in the flat southern part of Tehran. For instance, the Valiasr Street runs from Tehran&#x27;s railway station at elevation above sea level in the south of the city to Tajrish Square at 1712.6 m (5612.3 ft) elevation above sea level in the north. However, the elevation can even rise up to at the end of Velenjak in northern Tehran. The sparse texture, the existence of old gardens, orchards, green spaces along the highways and the lack of industrial activities in the north of the city have helped the air in the northern areas to be 2 to 3 degrees Celsius cooler than the southern areas of the city.

The main direction of the prevailing wind in Tehran is northwest to southeast. Other air currents that blow in the area of Tehran are:

# Tochal breeze: With the rapid cooling of the Alborz mountain range at night, a local high-pressure center is formed on Mount Tochal, and this cold current flows down the mountain due to its weight and high pressure; Thus, a gentle breeze blows into the city from the north at night.
# Southern and southeastern regional winds: these winds blow from the desert plains in the hot months of the year.
# Western winds: These winds are among the planetary winds that affect the city of Tehran more or less throughout the year and can be called the prevailing wind.

Air currents have a great effect on Tehran&#x27;s weather. The prevailing wind blowing from the west causes the west of the city to always be exposed to fresh air; Although this wind brings smoke and pollution from the western industrial areas, its strong wind can take the polluted air out of the city of Tehran.

In most years, winter provides half of Tehran&#x27;s total annual rainfall. March is the rainiest month of the year and about one-fifth of the annual rainfall occurs in it. Summer is also the least rainy season and September is the driest month of the year in Tehran. The average annual rainfall of the city is sometimes very different in the north and south regions. There are between 205 and 213 days of clear to partly cloudy weather in Tehran.

One of the most intense rains in Tehran happened on 21 April 1962 and this rain lasted for 10 hours. Meteorology also announced that the amount of rainfall on that one day in Tehran was equivalent to six years.

Summer is hot and dry with little rain, but relative humidity is generally low. Average high temperatures are between and during summer months, and it can sometimes rise up to during heat waves. Average low temperatures in summer are between and , and it can occasionally drop to below   in the mountainous north of the city at night.

Winter is cold and occasionally snowy, with an average of 12.3 snow days annually in central Tehran and more than 23.7 snow days annually in northern Tehran. During the winter months, average high temperatures are between and and average low temperatures are between and , and it can occasionally drop to below   during cold waves.

Most of the annual precipitation occurs from late autumn to mid-spring. March is the wettest month with an average precipitation of . The hottest month is July, with a mean minimum temperature of and a mean maximum temperature of , and the coldest is January, with a mean minimum temperature of and a mean maximum temperature of .

The highest recorded temperature was on 3 July 1958 and the lowest recorded temperature was on 8 January 1969.


In February 2005, heavy snow covered all parts of the city. Snow depth was recorded as in the southern part of the city and in the northern part of city. One newspaper reported that it had been the worst weather in 34 years. Ten thousand bulldozers and 13,000 municipal workers were deployed to keep the main roads open.

On 5 and 6 January 2008, a wave of heavy snow and low temperatures covered the city in a thick layer of snow and ice, forcing the Council of Ministers to officially declare a state of emergency and close down the capital from 6 January through 7 January.

On 3 February 2014, Tehran received heavy snowfall, specifically in the northern parts of the city, with a depth of . In one week of successive snowfalls, roads were made impassable in some areas, with the temperature ranging from   to  .

On 3 June 2014, a severe thunderstorm with powerful microbursts created a haboob, engulfing the city in sand and dust and causing five deaths, with more than 57 injured. This event also knocked down numerous trees and power lines. It struck between 5:00 and 6:00 p.m., dropping temperatures from   to   within an hour. The dramatic temperature drop was accompanied by wind gusts reaching nearly  .

=== Environmental issues ===
A plan to move the capital has been discussed many times in prior years, due mainly to the environmental issues of the region. Tehran is one of the world&#x27;s most polluted cities and is also located near two major fault lines.

The city suffers from severe air pollution, 80% of it due to cars. The remaining 20% is due to industrial pollution. Other estimates suggest that motorcycles alone account for 30% of air and 50% of noise pollution in Tehran. Tehran is also considered one of the strongest sources of greenhouse gas emissions in the Middle East. Enhanced concentration of carbon dioxide over the city (that are likely originated from the anthropogenic urban sources in the city) is easily detectable from satellite observations throughout the year.

In 2010, the government announced that &quot;for security and administrative reasons, the plan to move the capital from Tehran has been finalized.&quot; There are plans to relocate 163 state firms and several universities from Tehran to avoid damages from a potential earthquake.

The officials are engaged in a battle to reduce air pollution. It has, for instance, encouraged taxis and buses to convert from petrol engines to engines that run on compressed natural gas. Furthermore, the government has set up a &quot;Traffic Zone&quot; covering the city centre during peak traffic hours. Entering and driving inside this zone is only allowed with a special permit.

There have also been plans to raise people&#x27;s awareness of the hazards of pollution. One method that is being employed is the installation of Pollution Indicator Boards all around the city to monitor the level of particulate matter (PM2.5/PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and carbon monoxide (CO).

== Economy ==
Tehran is the economic centre of Iran. About 30% of Iran&#x27;s public-sector workforce and 45% of its large industrial firms are located in the city, and almost half of these workers are employed by the government. Most of the remainder of workers are factory workers, shopkeepers, laborers, and transport workers.

Few foreign companies operate in Tehran, due to the government&#x27;s complex international relations. But prior to the 1979 Revolution, many foreign companies were active in Iran. Tehran&#x27;s present-day modern industries include the manufacturing of automobiles, electronics and electrical equipment, weaponry, textiles, sugar, cement, and chemical products. It is also a leading centre for the sale of carpets and furniture. The oil refining companies of Pars Oil, Speedy, and Behran are based in Tehran.

Tehran relies heavily on private cars, buses, motorcycles, and taxis, and is one of the most car-dependent cities in the world. The Tehran Stock Exchange, which is a full member of the World Federation of Exchanges (WFE) and a founding member of the Federation of Euro-Asian Stock Exchanges, has been one of the world&#x27;s best-performing stock exchanges in recent years.

=== Fashion industry ===
Design, manufacturing, distribution, marketing, retail, advertising and other sectors of the fashion industry in Tehran have been able to grow significantly according to the needs of the country. In particular, a large number of male and female models are working in Tehran&#x27;s fashion advertising and promotion sections. Despite the lack of adequate laws to support models, payments to female models have been considered high. Also, modeling of children is usually prohibited in Tehran. Clothing manufacturers are closely related to other fashion sectors in Tehran. For example, the manufacturers of women&#x27;s boots and bodysuits have strengthened their exports and branding in other countries by using this connection.

=== Shopping ===

Tehran has a wide range of shopping centers, and is home to over 60 modern shopping malls. The city has a number of commercial districts, including those located at Valiasr, Davudie, and Zaferanie. The largest old bazaars of Tehran are the Grand Bazaar and the Bazaar of Tajrish. Iran Mall is the largest mall in the world in area.

Most of the international branded stores and upper-class shops are in the northern and western parts of the city. Tehran&#x27;s retail business is growing with several newly built malls and shopping centres.

Tehran is a center for the production of women&#x27;s clothing in Iran. Shoe (Mostly women&#x27;s boots) manufacturing companies in Tehran can be reached in the malls.

=== Tourism ===
Tehran, as one of the main tourist destinations in Iran, has a wealth of cultural attractions. It is home to royal complexes of Golestan, Saadabad and Niavaran, which were built under the reign of the country&#x27;s last two monarchies.

There are several historic, artistic, and scientific museums in Tehran, including the
* National Museum
* Malek Museum
* Cinema Museum at Ferdows Garden
* Abgineh Museum
* Museum of the Qasr Prison
* Carpet Museum
* Reverse Glass Painting Museum (vitray art)
* Safir Office Machines Museum
Also the Museum of Contemporary Art, which hosts works of famous artists such as Van Gogh, Pablo Picasso, and Andy Warhol. The Iranian Imperial Crown Jewels, one of the largest jewel collections in the world, are also on display at Tehran&#x27;s National Jewelry Museum.

A number of cultural and trade exhibitions take place in Tehran, which are mainly operated by the country&#x27;s International Exhibitions Company. Tehran&#x27;s annual International Book Fair is known to the international publishing world as one of the most important publishing events in Asia.

== Infrastructure ==

=== Highways and streets ===
Following the Islamic Revolution in 1979, the political system changed from constitutional monarchy to Islamic republic. Then the construction of political power in the country needed to change so that new spectrums of political power decision-making centers emerged in Iran. Motives, desires and actions of these new political power decision-making centers in Iran, made them rename streets and public places throughout the country, especially Tehran. For example Shahyad square changed to Azadi square and Pahlavi street changed to Valiasr street.

The metropolis of Tehran is equipped with a large network of highways and interchanges.

=== Cars ===

According to the head of Tehran Municipality&#x27;s Environment and Sustainable Development Office, Tehran was designed to have a capacity of about 300,000 cars, but more than five million cars are on the roads. The automotive industry has recently developed, but international sanctions influence the production processes periodically.

According to local media, Tehran has more than 200,000 taxis plying the roads daily, with several types of taxi available in the city. Airport taxis have a higher cost per kilometer as opposed to regular green and yellow taxis in the city.

=== Buses ===
Buses have served the city since the 1920s. Tehran&#x27;s transport system includes conventional buses, trolleybuses, and bus rapid transit (BRT). The city&#x27;s four major bus stations include the South Terminal, the East Terminal, the West Terminal, and the northcentral Beyhaghi Terminal.

The trolleybus system was opened in 1992, using a fleet of 65 articulated trolleybuses built by Czech Republic&#x27;s Škoda. This was the first trolleybus system in Iran. In 2005, trolleybuses were operating on five routes, all starting at Imam Hossein Square. Two routes running northeastwards operated almost entirely in a segregated busway located in the middle of the wide carriageway along Damavand Street, stopping only at purpose-built stops located about every 500 metres along the routes, effectively making these routes trolleybus-BRT (but they were not called such). The other three trolleybus routes ran south and operated in mixed traffic. Both route sections were served by limited-stop services and local (making all stops) services. A 3.2-kilometer extension from Shoosh Square to Rah Ahan Square was opened in March 2010. Visitors in 2014 found that the trolleybus system had closed, apparently sometime in 2013. However, it reopened in March 2016, operating on a single 1.8-km route between Meydan-e-Khorasan (Khorasan Square) and Bozorgrah-e-Be&#x27;sat. Around 30 vehicles had been refurbished and returned to service. Extensions were planned.

Tehran&#x27;s bus rapid transit (BRT) was officially inaugurated in 2008. It has 10 lines with some 215 stations in different areas of the city. , the BRT system had a network of , transporting 1.8 million passengers on a daily basis.

=== Railway and subway ===
Tehran has a central railway station that connects services round the clock to various cities in the country, along with a Tehran–Europe train line also running.

The feasibility study and conceptual planning of the construction of Tehran&#x27;s subway system were started in the 1970s. The first two of the eight projected metro lines were opened in 2001.
=== Airport ===

Tehran is served by the international airports of Mehrabad and Imam Khomeini. Mehrabad Airport, an old airport in western Tehran that doubles as a military base, is mainly used for domestic and charter flights. Imam Khomeini Airport, located south of the city, handles the main international flights.

=== Parks and green spaces ===

There are over 2,100 parks within the metropolis of Tehran, with one of the oldest being Jamshidie Park, which was first established as a private garden for Qajar prince Jamshid Davallu, and was then dedicated to the last empress of Iran, Farah Pahlavi. The total green space within Tehran stretches over 12,600 hectares, covering over 20 percent of the city&#x27;s area. The Parks and Green Spaces Organization of Tehran was established in 1960, and is responsible for the protection of the urban nature present in the city.

Tehran&#x27;s Birds Garden is the largest bird park in Iran. There is also a zoo located on the Tehran–Karaj Expressway, housing over 290 species within an area of about five hectares.

In 2009, the Ab-o-Atash Park (&quot;Water and Fire park&quot;) was founded. Its main features are an open water fountain area for cooling in the hot climate, fire towers, and an amphitheatre.

=== Energy ===
==== Water ====

Greater Tehran with its population of more than 13 million is supplied by surface water from the Lar dam on the Lar River in the Northeast of the city, the Latyan dam on the Jajrood River in the North, the Karaj River in the Northwest, as well as by groundwater in the vicinity of the city.

The city experiences stark water supply inequalities: impoverished districts struggle with inadequate water provision and hazardous water quality, while affluent areas are largely exempt from these hardships.

==== Solar energy ====

Solar panels have been installed in Tehran&#x27;s Pardisan Park for green electricity production, said Masoumeh Ebtekar, head of the Department of Environment.

According to the national energy roadmap, the government plans to promote green technology to increase the nominal capacity of power plants from 74 gigawatts to over 120 gigawatts by the end of 2025.

== Education ==
Tehran is the largest and most important educational center in Iran. There are a total of nearly 50 major colleges and universities in Greater Tehran.

Since the establishment of Dar ol Fonun by the order of Amir Kabir in the mid-19th century, Tehran has amassed a large number of institutions of higher education. Some of these institutions have played crucial roles in the unfolding of Iranian political events. Samuel M. Jordan, whom Jordan Avenue in Tehran was named after, was one of the founding pioneers of the American College of Tehran, which was one of the first modern high schools in the Middle East.

Among major educational institutions located in Tehran, Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic), University of Tehran, Sharif University of Technology, and Tehran University of Medical Sciences are the most prestigious. Other major universities located in Tehran include Tehran University of Art, Allameh Tabatabaei University, K. N. Toosi University of Technology, Shahid Beheshti University (Melli University), Kharazmi University, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Islamic Azad University, International Institute of Earthquake Engineering and Seismology, Iran&#x27;s Polymer and Petrochemical Institute, Shahed University, and Tarbiat Modarres University. Sharif University of Technology, Amirkabir University of Technology, Iran University of Science and Technology and K. N. Toosi University of Technology also located in Tehran is nationally well known for taking in the top undergraduate Engineering and Science students; and internationally recognized for training competent undergraduate students. It has probably the highest percentage of graduates who seek higher education abroad.

Tehran is also home to Iran&#x27;s largest military academy, and several religious schools and seminaries.

== Culture ==

The culture of Tehran concerns the arts, music, museums, festivals, many Persian entertainments and sports activities in Tehran, the capital city of Iran. Iranian festivals are held in Tehran along with regional and western festivals. Nowruz, Chaharshanbe Suri, Sizdah Be-dar, Yaldā Night, Valentine&#x27;s Day and Halloween have been popular festivals in recent decades.

=== Architecture ===

The oldest surviving architectural monuments of Tehran are from the Qajar and Pahlavi eras. In Greater Tehran, monuments dating back to the Seljuk era remain as well; notably the Toqrol Tower in Ray. Rashkan Castle, dating back to the ancient Parthian Empire, of which some artifacts are housed at the National Museum; and the Bahram fire temple, which remains since the Sassanian Empire.

Tehran only had a small population until the late 18th century but began to take a more considerable role in Iranian society after it was chosen as the capital city. Despite the regular occurrence of earthquakes during the Qajar period and after, some historic buildings remain from that era.

Tehran is Iran&#x27;s primate city, and is considered to have the most modernized infrastructure in the country. However, the gentrification of old neighbourhoods and the demolition of buildings of cultural significance have caused concerns.

Previously a low-rise city due to seismic activity in the region, modern high-rise developments in Tehran have been built in recent decades in order to service its growing population. There have been no major quakes in Tehran since 1830.

Tehran International Tower is the tallest skyscraper in Iran. It is 54-stories tall and located in the northern district of Yusef Abad.

The Azadi Tower, a memorial built under the reign of the Pahlavi dynasty, has long been the most famous symbol of Tehran. Originally constructed in commemoration of the 2,500th year of the foundation of the Imperial State of Iran, it combines elements of the architecture of the Achaemenid and Sassanid eras with post-classical Iranian architecture. The Milad Tower, which is the sixth tallest tower and the 24th-tallest freestanding structure in the world, is the city&#x27;s other famous landmark tower. Leila Araghian&#x27;s Tabiat Bridge, the largest pedestrian overpass in Tehran, was completed in 2014 and is also considered a landmark.

=== Fashion and clothing ===

The city has produced many notable Iranian design houses and clothing companies. Fashion events are also held in some areas of the city. Many famous Iranian models were born in Tehran, including Nazanin Afshin-Jam, Cameron Alborzian, Sahar Biniaz, Elnaaz Norouzi, Shermine Shahrivar and Sadaf Taherian.

Women of Tehran widely used over-the-knee and leather boots after 2000s.

=== Theater ===

Under the reign of the Qajars, Tehran was home to the royal theatre of Tekye Dowlat, located to the southeast of the Golestan Palace, in which traditional and religious performances were observed. It was eventually demolished and replaced with a bank building in 1947, following the reforms during the reign of Reza Shah.

Before the 1979 Revolution, the Iranian national stage had become the most famous performing scene for known international artists and troupes in the Middle East, with the Vahdat Hall, formerly known as Rudaki Hall, constructed to function as the national stage for opera and ballet. The hall was inaugurated in October 1967 and named after prominent Persian poet Rudaki. It is home to the Tehran Symphony Orchestra, the Tehran Opera Orchestra, and the Iranian National Ballet Company.

The City Theater of Tehran, one of Iran&#x27;s biggest theatre complexes, which contains several performance halls, was opened in 1972. It was built at the initiative and presidency of empress Farah Pahlavi, and was designed by architect Ali Sardar Afkhami, constructed within five years.

One of the gathering centers of cabarets in old Tehran was Laleh-Zar Street. Famous Persian cabarets were active in the city until 1979. They also introduced many domestic artists. In common language, cabaret was sometimes called &quot;home of dance&quot; or &quot;dancing place&quot;.

The annual events of Fajr Theater Festival and Tehran Puppet Theater Festival take place in Tehran.

=== Cinema ===
The first movie theater in Tehran was established by Mirza Ebrahim Khan in 1904. Until the early 1930s, there were 15 theaters in Tehran province and 11 in other provinces.

In present-day Tehran, most of the movie theatres are located downtown. The complexes of Kourosh Cinema, Mellat Gallery and Cineplex, Azadi Cinema, and Cinema Farhang are among the most popular cinema complexes in Tehran.

Several film festivals are held in Tehran, including Fajr Film Festival, Children and Youth Film Festival, House of Cinema Festival, Mobile Film and Photo Festival, Nahal Festival, Roshd Film Festival, Tehran Animation Festival, Tehran Short Film Festival, and Urban Film Festival.

=== Music and dance ===
There are a variety of concert halls in Tehran. An organization like the Roudaki Culture and Art Foundation has five different venues where more than 500 concerts take place this year. Vahdat Hall, Roudaki Hall, Ferdowsi Hall, Hafez Hall and Azadi Theater are the top five venues in Tehran, where classical, pop, traditional, rock or solo concerts take place.

Erotic dancers were active and trained in Tehran until the 1979 revolution. But after this date, due to the policies of the new government, these activities were completely banned.

=== Sports ===

Football and volleyball are the city&#x27;s most popular sports, while wrestling, basketball, and futsal are also major parts of the city&#x27;s sporting culture. Ice hockey and rugby are also popular in Tehran.

12 ski resorts operate in Iran, the most famous being Tochal, Dizin, and Shemshak, all within one to three hours from the city of Tehran.

Tochal&#x27;s resort is the world&#x27;s fifth-highest ski resort at over above sea level at its highest point. It is also the world&#x27;s nearest ski resort to a capital city. The resort was opened in 1976, shortly before the 1979 Revolution. It is equipped with an gondola lift that covers a huge vertical distance. There are two parallel chair ski lifts in Tochal that reach high near Tochal&#x27;s peak (at ), rising higher than the gondola&#x27;s seventh station, which is higher than any of the European ski resorts. From the Tochal peak, there are views of the Alborz range, including the Mount Damavand, a dormant volcano.

Tehran is the site of the national stadium of Azadi, the biggest stadium by capacity in West Asia, where many of the top matches of Iran&#x27;s Premier League are held. The stadium is a part of the Azadi Sport Complex, which was originally built to host the 7th Asian Games in September 1974. This was the first time the Asian Games were hosted in West Asia. Tehran played host to 3,010 athletes from 25 countries/NOCs, which was at the time the highest number of participants since the inception of the Games. That followed hosting the 6th AFC Asian Cup in June 1976, and then the first West Asian Games in November 1997. The success of the games led to the creation of the West Asian Games Federation (WAGF), and the intention of hosting the games every two years. The city had also hosted the final of the 1968 AFC Asian Cup. Several FIVB Volleyball World League courses have also been hosted in Tehran.

=== Food ===

There are many restaurants and cafes in Tehran, both modern and classic, serving both Iranian and cosmopolitan cuisine. Pizzerias, sandwich bars, and kebab shops make up the majority of food shops in Tehran.

=== Graffiti ===

Many styles of graffiti are seen in Tehran. Some are political and revolutionary slogans painted by governmental organizations, and some are works of art by ordinary citizens, representing their views on both social and political issues. However, unsanctioned street art is forbidden in Iran, and such works are usually short-lived.

During the 2009 Iranian presidential election protests, many graffiti works were created by people supporting the Green Movement. They were removed from the walls by the paramilitary Basij forces.

In recent years, Tehran Municipality has been using graffiti in order to beautify the city. Several graffiti festivals have also taken place in Tehran, including the one organized by the Tehran University of Art in October 2014.

<text>In mathematics, more specifically ring theory, the Jacobson radical of a ring &quot;R&quot; is the ideal consisting of those elements in &quot;R&quot; that annihilate all simple right &quot;R&quot;-modules. It happens that substituting &quot;left&quot; in place of &quot;right&quot; in the definition yields the same ideal, and so the notion is left–right symmetric. The Jacobson radical of a ring is frequently denoted by J(&quot;R&quot;) or rad(&quot;R&quot;); the former notation will be preferred in this article, because it avoids confusion with other radicals of a ring. The Jacobson radical is named after Nathan Jacobson, who was the first to study it for arbitrary rings in .

The Jacobson radical of a ring has numerous internal characterizations, including a few definitions that successfully extend the notion to non-unital rings. The radical of a module extends the definition of the Jacobson radical to include modules. The Jacobson radical plays a prominent role in many ring- and module-theoretic results, such as Nakayama&#x27;s lemma.

== Definitions ==
There are multiple equivalent definitions and characterizations of the Jacobson radical, but it is useful to consider the definitions based on if the ring is commutative or not.

=== Commutative case ===
In the commutative case, the Jacobson radical of a commutative ring &quot;R&quot; is defined as the intersection of all maximal ideals formula_1. If we denote as the set of all maximal ideals in &quot;R&quot; thenformula_2This definition can be used for explicit calculations in a number of simple cases, such as for local rings , which have a unique maximal ideal, Artinian rings, and products thereof. See the examples section for explicit computations.

=== Noncommutative/general case ===
For a general ring with unity &quot;R&quot;, the Jacobson radical J(&quot;R&quot;) is defined as the ideal of all elements such that whenever &quot;M&quot; is a simple &quot;R&quot;-module. That is,
formula_3
This is equivalent to the definition in the commutative case for a commutative ring &quot;R&quot; because the simple modules over a commutative ring are of the form for some maximal ideal , and the annihilators of in &quot;R&quot; are precisely the elements of formula_1, i.e. .

== Motivation ==
Understanding the Jacobson radical lies in a few different cases: namely its applications and the resulting geometric interpretations, and its algebraic interpretations.

=== Geometric applications ===

Although Jacobson originally introduced his radical as a technique for building a theory of radicals for arbitrary rings, one of the motivating reasons for why the Jacobson radical is considered in the commutative case is because of its appearance in Nakayama&#x27;s lemma. This lemma is a technical tool for studying finitely generated modules over commutative rings that has an easy geometric interpretation: If we have a vector bundle over a topological space &quot;X&quot;, and pick a point , then any basis of &quot;E&quot;|&quot;p&quot; can be extended to a basis of sections of for some neighborhood .

Another application is in the case of finitely generated commutative rings of the form formula_5 for some base ring &quot;k&quot; (such as a field, or the ring of integers). In this case the nilradical and the Jacobson radical coincide. This means we could interpret the Jacobson radical as a measure for how far the ideal &quot;I&quot; defining the ring &quot;R&quot; is from defining the ring of functions on an algebraic variety because of the Hilbert Nullstellensatz theorem. This is because algebraic varieties cannot have a ring of functions with infinitesimals: this is a structure that is only considered in scheme theory.

=== Equivalent characterizations ===
The Jacobson radical of a ring has various internal and external characterizations. The following equivalences appear in many noncommutative algebra texts such as , , and .

The following are equivalent characterizations of the Jacobson radical in rings with unity (characterizations for rings without unity are given immediately afterward):

* J(&quot;R&quot;) equals the intersection of all maximal right ideals of the ring. The equivalence coming from the fact that for all maximal right ideals &quot;M&quot;, is a simple right &quot;R&quot;-module, and that in fact all simple right &quot;R&quot;-modules are isomorphic to one of this type via the map from &quot;R&quot; to &quot;S&quot; given by for any generator &quot;x&quot; of &quot;S&quot;. It is also true that J(&quot;R&quot;) equals the intersection of all maximal left ideals within the ring. These characterizations are internal to the ring, since one only needs to find the maximal right ideals of the ring. For example, if a ring is local, and has a unique maximal &quot;right ideal&quot;, then this unique maximal right ideal is exactly J(&quot;R&quot;). Maximal ideals are in a sense easier to look for than annihilators of modules. This characterization is deficient, however, because it does not prove useful when working computationally with J(&quot;R&quot;). The left-right symmetry of these two definitions is remarkable and has various interesting consequences. This symmetry stands in contrast to the lack of symmetry in the socles of &quot;R&quot;, for it may happen that soc(&quot;R&quot;&quot;R&quot;) is not equal to soc(&quot;R&quot;&quot;R&quot;). If &quot;R&quot; is a non-commutative ring, J(&quot;R&quot;) is not necessarily equal to the intersection of all maximal &quot;two-sided&quot; ideals of &quot;R&quot;. For instance, if &quot;V&quot; is a countable direct sum of copies of a field &quot;k&quot; and (the ring of endomorphisms of &quot;V&quot; as a &quot;k&quot;-module), then because &quot;R&quot; is known to be von Neumann regular, but there is exactly one maximal double-sided ideal in &quot;R&quot; consisting of endomorphisms with finite-dimensional image.
* J(&quot;R&quot;) equals the sum of all superfluous right ideals (or symmetrically, the sum of all superfluous left ideals) of &quot;R&quot;. Comparing this with the previous definition, the sum of superfluous right ideals equals the intersection of maximal right ideals. This phenomenon is reflected dually for the right socle of &quot;R&quot;; soc(&quot;R&quot;&quot;R&quot;) is both the sum of minimal right ideals and the intersection of essential right ideals. In fact, these two relationships hold for the radicals and socles of modules in general.
* As defined in the introduction, J(&quot;R&quot;) equals the intersection of all annihilators of simple right &quot;R&quot;-modules, however it is also true that it is the intersection of annihilators of simple left modules. An ideal that is the annihilator of a simple module is known as a primitive ideal, and so a reformulation of this states that the Jacobson radical is the intersection of all primitive ideals. This characterization is useful when studying modules over rings. For instance, if &quot;U&quot; is a right &quot;R&quot;-module, and &quot;V&quot; is a maximal submodule of &quot;U&quot;, is contained in &quot;V&quot;, where denotes all products of elements of J(&quot;R&quot;) (the &quot;scalars&quot;) with elements in &quot;U&quot;, on the right. This follows from the fact that the quotient module is simple and hence annihilated by J(&quot;R&quot;).
* J(&quot;R&quot;) is the unique right ideal of &quot;R&quot; maximal with the property that every element is right quasiregular (or equivalently left quasiregular). This characterization of the Jacobson radical is useful both computationally and in aiding intuition. Furthermore, this characterization is useful in studying modules over a ring. Nakayama&#x27;s lemma is perhaps the most well-known instance of this. Although every element of the J(&quot;R&quot;) is necessarily quasiregular, not every quasiregular element is necessarily a member of J(&quot;R&quot;).
* While not every quasiregular element is in J(&quot;R&quot;), it can be shown that &quot;y&quot; is in J(&quot;R&quot;) if and only if &quot;xy&quot; is left quasiregular for all &quot;x&quot; in &quot;R&quot;.
* J(&quot;R&quot;) is the set of elements &quot;x&quot; in &quot;R&quot; such that every element of is a unit: . In fact, is in the Jacobson radical if and only if is invertible for any , if and only if is invertible for any . This means &quot;xy&quot; and &quot;yx&quot; behave similarly to a nilpotent element &quot;z&quot; with and .

For rings without unity it is possible to have ; however, the equation still holds. The following are equivalent characterizations of J(&quot;R&quot;) for rings without unity:
* The notion of left quasiregularity can be generalized in the following way. Call an element &quot;a&quot; in &quot;R&quot; left &quot;generalized quasiregular&quot; if there exists &quot;c&quot; in &quot;R&quot; such that . Then J(&quot;R&quot;) consists of every element &quot;a&quot; for which &quot;ra&quot; is left generalized quasiregular for all &quot;r&quot; in &quot;R&quot;. It can be checked that this definition coincides with the previous quasiregular definition for rings with unity.
* For a ring without unity, the definition of a left simple module &quot;M&quot; is amended by adding the condition that . With this understanding, J(&quot;R&quot;) may be defined as the intersection of all annihilators of simple left &quot;R&quot; modules, or just &quot;R&quot; if there are no simple left &quot;R&quot; modules. Rings without unity with no simple modules do exist, in which case , and the ring is called a radical ring. By using the generalized quasiregular characterization of the radical, it is clear that if one finds a ring with J(&quot;R&quot;) nonzero, then J(&quot;R&quot;) is a radical ring when considered as a ring without unity.

== Examples ==

=== Commutative examples ===
* For the ring of integers Z its Jacobson radical is the zero ideal, so , because it is given by the intersection of every ideal generated by a prime number (&quot;p&quot;). Since , and we are taking an infinite intersection with no common elements besides 0 between all maximal ideals, we have the computation.
* For a local ring the Jacobson radical is simply . This is an important case because of its use in applying Nakayama&#x27;s lemma. In particular, it implies if we have an algebraic vector bundle over a scheme or algebraic variety &quot;X&quot;, and we fix a basis of &quot;E&quot;|&quot;p&quot; for some point , then this basis lifts to a set of generators for all sections for some neighborhood &quot;U&quot; of &quot;p&quot;.
* If &quot;k&quot; is a field and is a ring of formal power series, then J(&quot;R&quot;) consists of those power series whose constant term is zero, i.e. the power series in the ideal .
* In the case of an Artinian rings, such as , the Jacobson radical is .
* The previous example could be extended to the ring , giving .
* The Jacobson radical of the ring Z/12Z is 6Z/12Z, which is the intersection of the maximal ideals 2Z/12Z and 3Z/12Z.
* Consider the ring , where the second is the localization of by the prime ideal . Then, the Jacobson radical is trivial because the maximal ideals are generated by an element of the form for .

=== Noncommutative examples ===
* Rings for which J(&quot;R&quot;) is are called semiprimitive rings, or sometimes &quot;Jacobson semisimple rings&quot;. The Jacobson radical of any field, any von Neumann regular ring and any left or right primitive ring is . The Jacobson radical of the integers is .
* If &quot;K&quot; is a field and &quot;R&quot; is the ring of all upper triangular &quot;n&quot;-by-&quot;n&quot; matrices with entries in &quot;K&quot;, then J(&quot;R&quot;) consists of all upper triangular matrices with zeros on the main diagonal.
* Start with a finite, acyclic quiver Γ and a field &quot;K&quot; and consider the quiver algebra &quot;K&quot;Γ (as described in the article &quot;Quiver&quot;). The Jacobson radical of this ring is generated by all the paths in Γ of length ≥ 1.
* The Jacobson radical of a C*-algebra is . This follows from the Gelfand–Naimark theorem and the fact that for a C*-algebra, a topologically irreducible *-representation on a Hilbert space is algebraically irreducible, so that its kernel is a primitive ideal in the purely algebraic sense (see &quot;Spectrum of a C*-algebra&quot;).

== Properties ==
* If &quot;R&quot; is unital and is not the trivial ring , the Jacobson radical is always distinct from &quot;R&quot; since rings with unity always have maximal right ideals. However, some important theorems and conjectures in ring theory consider the case when – &quot;If &quot;R&quot; is a nil ring (that is, each of its elements is nilpotent), is the polynomial ring &quot;R&quot;[&quot;x&quot;] equal to its Jacobson radical?&quot; is equivalent to the open Köthe conjecture.
* For any ideal &quot;I&quot; contained in J(&quot;R&quot;), .
* In particular, the Jacobson radical of the ring is zero. Rings with zero Jacobson radical are called semiprimitive rings. 
* A ring is semisimple if and only if it is Artinian and its Jacobson radical is zero.
* If is a surjective ring homomorphism, then .
* If &quot;R&quot; is a ring with unity and &quot;M&quot; is a finitely generated left &quot;R&quot;-module with , then (Nakayama&#x27;s lemma).
* J(&quot;R&quot;) contains all central nilpotent elements, but contains no idempotent elements except for 0.
* J(&quot;R&quot;) contains every nil ideal of &quot;R&quot;. If &quot;R&quot; is left or right Artinian, then J(&quot;R&quot;) is a nilpotent ideal.This can actually be made stronger: If is a composition series for the right &quot;R&quot;-module &quot;R&quot; (such a series is sure to exist if &quot;R&quot; is right Artinian, and there is a similar left composition series if &quot;R&quot; is left Artinian), then .Note, however, that in general the Jacobson radical need not consist of only the nilpotent elements of the ring.
* If &quot;R&quot; is commutative and finitely generated as an algebra over either a field or Z, then J(&quot;R&quot;) is equal to the nilradical of &quot;R&quot;.
* The Jacobson radical of a (unital) ring is its largest superfluous right (equivalently, left) ideal.

<text>Thimphu (; ) is the capital and largest city of Bhutan. It is situated in the western central part of Bhutan, and the surrounding valley is one of Bhutan&#x27;s &quot;dzongkhags&quot;, the Thimphu District. The ancient capital city of Punakha was replaced by Thimphu as capital in 1955, and in 1961 Thimphu was declared as the capital of the Kingdom of Bhutan by the 3rd Druk Gyalpo Jigme Dorji Wangchuck.

The city extends in a north–south direction on the west bank of the valley formed by the Wang Chhu, which flows out into India as the Raidāk River. Thimphu is the sixth highest capital in the world by altitude and ranges in altitude from to . Unusually for a capital city, Thimphu does not have its own airport, instead it relies on the Paro Airport, acessible by road away.

Thimphu, as the political and economic center of Bhutan, has a dominant agriculture and livestock base, which contributes to 45% of the country&#x27;s GNP. Tourism, though a contributor to the economy, is strictly regulated, maintaining a balance between the traditional, development and modernization. Thimphu contains most of the important political buildings in Bhutan, including the National Assembly of the newly-formed parliamentary democracy and Dechencholing Palace, the official residence of the King, located to the north of the city. Thimphu is coordinated by the &quot;Thimphu Structure Plan, 2002-2027&quot;, an urban development plan with the objective of protecting the fragile ecology of the valley. Some of this development was undertaken with financial assistance from the World Bank and Asian Development Bank.

The culture of Bhutan is fully reflected in Thimphu in literature, religion, customs, and national dress code, the monastic practices of the monasteries, music, and dance, and in the media. Tshechu is an important festival when mask dances, popularly known as Cham dances, are performed in the courtyards of the Tashichho Dzong in Thimphu. It is a four-day festival held every year in September or October, on dates corresponding to the Bhutanese calendar.

==History==
Before 1960, Thimphu consisted of a group of hamlets scattered across the valley including Motithang, Changangkha, Changlimithang, Langchupakha, and Taba, some of which constitute districts of the city today (see below for district details). In 1885, a battle was held at what is now the Changlimithang sports ground in Thimphu. The decisive victory opened the way for Ugyen Wangchuck, the first King of Bhutan, to virtually control the whole country. Since this time the sports ground has been of major importance to the city; football, cricket matches and archery competitions take place there. The modern Changlimithang Stadium was built on the site in 1974. Under the Wangchuck dynasty, the country enjoyed peace and progress under successive reformist monarchs. The third king, Jigme Dorji Wangchuck, reformed the old pseudo-feudal systems by abolishing serfdom, redistributing land, and reforming taxation. He also introduced many executive, legislative, and judiciary reforms. Reforms continued and in 1952 the decision was made to shift the capital from the ancient capital of Punakha to Thimphu. The fourth king, Jigme Singye Wangchuck, opened the country for development and India provided the needed impetus in this process with financial and other forms of assistance. In 1961, Thimphu officially became the capital of Bhutan.

Bhutan joined the Colombo Plan in 1962, the Universal Postal Union in 1969 and became a member of the United Nations in 1971. The presence of diplomatic missions and international funding organizations in Thimphu resulted in rapid expansion of Thimphu as a metropolis.

The fourth king, who had established the National Assembly in 1953, devolved all executive powers to a council of ministers elected by the people in 1998. He introduced a system of voting no confidence in the king, which empowered the parliament to remove the monarch. The National Constitution Committee in Thimphu started drafting the Constitution of the Kingdom of Bhutan in 2001. In 2005, the fourth king of Bhutan announced his decision to hand over the reins of his kingdom to his son Prince Jigme Khesar Namgyal Wangchuk. The coronation of the king was held in Thimphu at the refurbished Changlimithang Stadium and coincided with the centenary of the establishment of the House of Wangchuck. In 2008, this paved way for the transition from absolute monarchic rule to a parliamentary democratic constitutional monarchy, with Thimphu as the headquarters of the new government, with the national defined objective of achieving &quot;Gross National Happiness&quot; (GNH) concomitant with the growth of Gross National Product (GNP).

==Geography and climate==

Thimphu is situated in the constricted, linear valley of the Raidāk River, which is also known as the Thimphu River (&quot;Thim Chuu or Wangchhu&quot;). While the surrounding hills are in an altitudinal range of (warm temperate climate between and cold temperate zone between ), the city itself has an altitude range varying between and . It is these two variations in altitude and climate which determine the habitable zones and vegetation typology for the valley. The valley, however, is thinly-forested and is spread out to the north and west. At the southern end of the city, the Lungten Zampa bridge connects the east and west banks of the Wang Chuu which flows through the heart of city.

The Raidāk River raises in the snow fields at an altitude of about . It has many tributaries that flow from the Himalayan peaks that largely dictate the topography of the Thimphu valley. The Thimphu valley, so formed, is delimited by a steep eastern ridge that rises from the riverbed and a valley formation with gradually sloping topography, extending from Dechencholing and Simtokha, on the western banks of the Raidāk. The north–south orientation of the hill ranges of the valley means that they are exposed to moist monsoon winds which engulf the inner Himalayas and its lower valleys. However, the windward and leeward sides of the hill ranges have different vegetation patterns depending on the varying rainfall incidence in the two sides. Thimphu Valley, lying in the leeward side of the mountains, is comparatively dry and contains a different type of vegetation as compared to the windward side. Hence, the coniferous vegetation in the valley is attributed to this phenomenon. Punakha, the old capital of Bhutan, is on the windward side with broad-leaved trees dominating the topography.

The city experiences a southwest monsoon-influenced subtropical highland climate (&quot;Cwb&quot;). The southwest monsoon rainfall occurs during mid-April to September. Lightning and thunder often precedes rainfall in the region with cumulonimbus clouds and light showers dominating the weather. Continuous rainfall for several days occurs resulting in landslides and blockage of roads. Streams and rivers swell up carrying huge amounts of debris from forests. Deep puddles, thick mud, and landslides along roads form barriers to transportation. Cold winds, low temperatures at night, and moderate temperatures during the day, cloudiness, light showers and snowfall mark winter weather in this zone. Fog causes poor visibility, which poses a threat to vehicular traffic in the city. As spring approaches, the landscape is marked by violent winds and relatively dry and clear skies.


==Demographics==

According to the census of 31 May 2005, the population of the city was 79,185 with a density of , with 92,929 over an area of in the entire district; the corresponding figure projected in 2010 for the district was 104,200. In 2011, the city&#x27;s population was about 91,000.

===City planning===
Thimphu was selected to be the capital of Bhutan in 1952 but was not officially established as capital of Bhutan until 1961. It was then a hamlet of a few houses built, around the Tashichhoe Dzong. The city has expanded slowly over the years along river banks and on high ground. Lower plains along the river have also been occupied. It was only after the country was opened for foreign visitors that it grew rapidly. Thimphu is now a major city with all civic amenities such as well planned wide roads with traffic police controlling the traffic, banks, hotels and restaurants, institutions of arts, culture, media, sports and also the traditional dzongs, monasteries and chortens. Consequently, a boom in property value in Thimphu has been reported.

The residential area of the city constitutes 38.3% of the total area. In the non-residential area, 9.3% of the city consists of administrative buildings, 4% of commercial establishments, 10.1% is taken up by health, educational or institutional structures, 2% by industrial establishments and 3.8% by security. The remaining 32.5% of the city constitutes dispersed open spaces with vacant lands, which need to be preserved in any future planning and expansion.

The Thimphu Structure Plan is a modern urban development plan for the Thimphu city, evolved in 1998, with the objective of protecting the fragile ecology of the valley, including its rivers and forests. This planning was necessitated due to growth of automobiles and pressure on the public health infrastructure in the town centre, restrictions imposed on plot coverage and building heights. The plan was approved by the Council of Ministers in 2003. An elected body, the Thimphu Municipal Corporation, is implementing the plan, drawn up by the American architect Christopher Charles Benninger. This plan is estimated to cost more than $1 billion when completed. Funds for implementation of the plan are being provided by the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. There are some disputed areas between land owners and stakeholders, which has resulted in the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank requesting the Ministry of Works and Human Settlement (MOWHS) to resolve the issues through a process of the agreement, before further funds are released.

The clear planning concepts that have been established within the &#x27;Structured Plan&#x27; are: the Tashichheo Dzong, Wang Chuu and the streams, Green Hills and their Forest cover, monasteries, temples, chortens and prayer flags, the urban core, urban villages and the urban corridor. The southern entrance of the city at Simtokha Dzong anchors the city limits with the Northern and Western limits of the Wang Chuu Valley.

Under a development plan for 2027, much of the city will be car-free pedestrian zones filled with arcaded walkways, plazas, courtyards, cafes, and exhibitions, with automobile traffic confined to the edges of the city. Parks and footpaths will be developed along riverfronts, and no construction will be allowed within of a river or stream. City planners also announced that the rule that buildings be constructed to reflect traditional Bhutanese architecture, which was often violated in the past, would be enforced more strictly. Many of the economic activities that take place in the city, along with military and police infrastructure, would be moved. It is expected that by this time, the city&#x27;s population will have increased to 162,000.

===Urban expansion===

Over the last 50 years, since its establishment as the capital of Bhutan, Thimphu has witnessed expansion, initially at a slow pace, then rapidly after the country was opened up to the outside world after the coronation of the fourth King, Jigme Singye Wangchuck. Broadly, the city&#x27;s natural systems are under three categories: natural (forest, bush cover, river, and watersheds), agricultural (orchards, rice paddies, grazing lands) and recreational (public open space, parks, stadium).

The urban expansion has seen a structured development plan for 2027. The buildings will continue to be built to retain ancient Bhutanese culture and architectural styles but with a measured and modulated blend of modern development, meeting requirements of national and civic administration and all basic civic amenities such as roads, water supply and drainage, hospitals, schools and colleges, electricity, media centres and so forth. The monuments or buildings of note are the sprawling Tashichho Dzong, built like a fortress, which is the centre of Bhutanese administration as well as monastic centre, the Memorial Chorten, Thimphu and the National Assembly of the newly formed parliamentary democracy within the monarchic rule. The Palace of the King located to the north of the city, called the Dechencholing Palace, the official residence of the King, is an impressive structure that provides a grand aerial view of the city.

Rapid expansion following the pattern of rural exodus has resulted in considerable rebuilding in the city centre and mushrooming of suburban development elsewhere. Norzin Lam, the recently upgraded main thoroughfare, is lined with shops, restaurants, retail arcades and public buildings.

Within the core area of the city, there is a mix of apartment blocks, small family homes and family-owned stores. By regulation, all buildings are required to be designed in traditional style with Buddhist paintings and motifs. A lively weekend market near the river supplies meat, vegetables and tourist items. Most of the city&#x27;s limited light industry is located south of the main bridge. Thimphu has a growing number of commercial services and offices, which provide for ever-growing local needs.

==Architecture==
The traditional architectural monuments in Thimphu, as in the rest of Bhutan, are of typical Bhutanese architecture of monasteries, dzongs (most striking fortress type structures), chortens, gateways, Lhakhangs, other sacred places and royal palaces, which are the most distinctive architectural forms of Bhutan. Prayer Flags, Mani Walls and Prayer Wheels present a propitious setting throughout the urban agglomerate of Thimphu. The most prominent architecturally elegant, traditional Bhutanese building structures in Thimphu are the Tashichho Dzong, Drubthob Goemba (now the Zilluka nunnery), Tango Goempa or Cheri Goempa, the Memorial Chorten, Thimphu, Dechen Phodrang, and Changangkha Lhakhang, all vintage monuments with rich history.

These are further sanctified by the recent additions to the architectural excellence of buildings, a fusion of the traditional and modern architecture which are mostly post 1962, after Thimphu became the Capital of Bhutan and opened up for tourism under various Five Year Developmental Plans. The buildings under this category are the National Institute for Zorig Chusum, National Library, National Assembly cum SAARC Building, National Institute for Traditional Medicine, National Textile Museum, Voluntary Artists Studio, Royal Academy of Performing Arts, Telecom Tower and many more. The residential buildings in Thimphu have also undergone change in their construction methods without sacrificing the traditional Bhutanese designs said to be &quot;reminiscent of Swiss Chalets.&quot;

;Tashichhoe Dzong

The most prominent landmark in Thimphu is the Tashichho Dzong (&quot;Fortress of the Glorious Religion&quot;) located on the west bank of the Wang Chuu. The imposing white washed structure, as seen now, has undergone several renovations over the centuries following fires and earthquakes. Subsequent to introduction of the Drukpa Kargyu lineage by Lama Phajo and Zhabdrung acquiring the Dzong in 1641, the Dzong was renamed as Tashichho Dzong. During this time the practice of using a Dzong both as a religious centre for lamas and administrative centre for civic administration was introduced. Apart from the throne room and offices of the King of Bhutan, as an administrative building, it houses the Central Secretariat, the offices of the ministries of Home Affairs and Finance. The National Assembly, which used to be located in the Dzong, is now in a separate building called the SAARC building.

; Simtokha Dzong
Simtokha Dzong, known as &quot;Sangak Zabdhon Phodrang&quot; (Palace of the Profound Meaning of Secret Mantras), is said to be the oldest surviving fortress-cum-monastery in Bhutan. Established in 1629 by Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal, it was attacked several times in the 17th century but survived and was refurbished repeatedly. It is a small dzong (only square with gate on the southern direction), located about to the south of Thimphu. It now houses a Dzongkha language learning institutes.

; Dechen Phodrang Monastery
Dechen Phrodrang means &quot;Palace of Great Bliss&quot;. It is a Buddhist monastery located to the north of Thimphu. The Dzong located at the end of Gaden Lam was originally the site of Thimphu&#x27;s original Tashichhoe Dzong. In 1971, it was converted into a monastic school with 450 student monks enrolled for eight-year courses. It has a staff of 15. The monastery contains a number of important historical Bhutanese artifacts including 12th century paintings monitored by UNESCO and a noted statue of Namgyal on the upper floor. In the downstairs chapel, there is a central Sakyamuni Buddha.

; Dechencholing Palace
Dechencholing Palace (, Wylie: &quot;bde chen chos gling&quot;) is located to the northern end of the Thimphu valley on the east bank of the Thimphu Chuu. It was the residence of the late Royal Grandmother, popularly known as Gayum Phuntsho Choden Wangchuck. King Jigme Singye Wangchuck was born here on 11 November 1955, but makes his residence at the Samteling Palace (Royal Cottage).

;Tango Monastery

The Tango Monastery is located to the north of Thimphu near Cheri Mountain. It was founded by Lama Gyalwa Lhanampa in the 13th century and built in its present form by Tenzin Rabgye, the 4th Temporal Ruler in 1688. According to local legend, the location of this monastery is the holy place where Avalokiteshvara revealed himself as &quot;the self-emanated form of the Wrathful Hayagriva&quot;. The location had been prophesied in Tibet. In 1616, the Tibetan Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal meditated in its cave. The self-emanated form of the wrathful Hayagriva is deified in the monastery. It belongs to the Drukpa Kagyu School of Buddhism in Bhutan. The word &#x27;Tango&#x27; in Bhutanese language means &quot;horse head&quot;. This name conforms to the main deity Hayagriva (local name &quot;Tandin&quot;) deified in the monastery.

Tango Monastery is built in the dzong fashion, and has a curved (semi-circular) outside wall and prominent main tower with recesses. It covers the caves where originally meditation and miracles were performed by saints from the 12th century onwards. Behind the series of prayer wheels are engraved slates. Inside the courtyard is a gallery, illustrating the leaders of the Drukpa Kagyupa lineage.

;Cheri Monastery

Cheri Monastery, also called Chagri Dorjeden Monastery, was established in 1620 by Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal; the first monastery established by him at a young age of 27. Zhabdrung spent three years in strict retreat at Chagri and resided there for many periods throughout the rest of his life. It was at Chagri in 1623 that he established the first Drukpa Kagyu monastic order in Bhutan. The monastery, which is now a major teaching and retreat centre of the Southern Drukpa Kagyu order, is located at the northern end of Thimphu Valley, about from the capital. It sits on a hill above the end of the road at Dodeyna and it takes about an hour&#x27;s walk up the steep hill to reach the monastery from there. According to Bhutanese religious histories, the place was first visited by Padmasambhava in the 8th century. In the 13th century, it was visited by Phajo Drugom Zhigpo, the Tibetan Lama who first established the Drukpa Kagyu tradition in Bhutan. There is a silver chorten inside the monastery that enshrines the ashes of Zhabdrung&#x27;s father.

;Buddha Dordenma
The Buddha Dordenma is a bronze statue, a &#x27;Vajra Throne&#x27; Buddha, that is under construction amidst the ruins of Kuensel Phodrang, overlooking Thimphu city, about above the Wang Chuu river bed. This location was the palace of Sherab Wangchuck, the 13th Desi Druk. It is a gigantic Shakyamuni Buddha statue under construction. The statue will house over one lakh (one hundred thousand) smaller Buddha statues, each of which, like the Buddha Dordenma itself, will be made of bronze and gilded in gold. Upon completion, it will be one of the largest Buddha rupas in the world, at a height of . The statue alone is being built at a cost of US$47 million, by Aerosun Corporation of Nanjing, China, while the total cost of the Buddha Dordenma Project is well over US$100 million. The interior will accommodate 100,000 and 25,000 gilded Buddhas respectively. It is planned to be completed by October 2010. Apart from commemorating the centennial of the Bhutanese monarchy, it fulfils two prophecies. In the 20th century, the renowned yogi Sonam Zangpo prophesied that a large statue of either Padmasambhava, Buddha or of a phurba would be built in the region &quot;to bestow blessings, peace and happiness on the whole world&quot;. Additionally the statue is mentioned in the ancient terma of Guru Padmasambhava himself, said to date from approximately the 8th century, and recovered some 800 years ago by terton Pema Lingpa.

;Memorial Chorten

The Memorial Chorten, also known as the &#x27;Thimphu Chorten&#x27;, is a chorten in Thimphu located on Doeboom Lam in the southern-central part of the city near the main roundabout and Indian Military Hospital. The chorten that dominates the skyline of Thimphu was built in 1974 to honour the 3rd King of Bhutan, Jigme Dorji Wangchuck (1928–1972). This prominent landmark in the city has golden spires and bells. In 2008, it underwent extensive renovation. This chorten is popularly known as &quot;the most visible religious landmark in Bhutan&quot;. It was consecrated by the Late Dudjom Rimpoche. This chorten is unlike other chortens as it does not enshrine the mortal remains of the late King. Only the King&#x27;s photo in a ceremonial dress adorns a hall in the ground floor. The King, when he was alive, wanted to build &quot;a chorten to represent the mind of the Buddha&quot;. It is designed as a Tibetan style chorten, also called as the Jangchup Chorten, patterned on the design of a classical stupa, with a pyramidal pillar crowned by a crescent of Moon and Sun. The feature that is distinct here is the outward flaring of the rounded part to give the shape of a vase, rather than a dome shape. The chorten depicts larger than life size images of tantric deities, with some 36 of them in erotic poses.

===Other attractions===
There are several other attractions in Thimphu such as the National Post Office, the Clock Tower Square and the Motithang Takin Preserve (an erstwhile Zoo).

;National Post Office and the Bhutan Postal Museum
The National Post Office, located in the north wing of the large General Post Office building on the Dremton Lam (Drentoen Lam), is where the famous Bhutan&#x27;s Philatelic Bureau sells stamps and souvenir sheets of Bhutan stamps. In view of their colourful presentation and limited issue, stamp collectors all over the world know that Bhutan is the first country to diversify and export quality stamps; particularly, 3D stamps are collectors items. The Bhutan Postal Museum opened its doors in November 2015 and is housed on the groundfloor of the General Post Office building.

;Clock Tower Square

The Clock Tower Square is a recently renovated square surrounded by shops and restaurants. Fountains and traditional Bhutanese Mani or prayer wheels make the place more comfortable. On one side, the luxurious Druk Hotel is situated. Various programmes and activities are held here. It was also the check point for the SAARC Car Rally.

;Motithang Takin Preserve

The Motithang Takin Preserve in Thimphu is a wildlife reserve area for Bhutan takin, the National Animal of Bhutan. Originally a mini-zoo, it was converted into a preserve when it was discovered that the animals refrained from inhabiting the surrounding forest even when set free. The reason for declaring the takin as a National Animal of Bhutan on 25 November 2005 (&quot;Budorcas taxicolor&quot;) is attributed to a legend of the animal&#x27;s creation in Bhutan in the 15th century by Lama Drukpa Kunley. The King of Bhutan believed that it was improper for a Buddhist country to confine animals for religious and environmental reasons, so he ordered the closure of the mini-zoo and the release of the animals into the forest. However, the Takin remained rooted to the town and were seen straying in the streets of Thimphu in search of fodder. Hence, an exclusive preserve was created for them to live freely.

==Economy==
Thimphu is the political and economic centre of Bhutan and the location of the central government. 

A morning market is held on the central square during weekends. These are the only days when the residents of Thimphu can buy fresh fruit and vegetables. The inhabitants rely on the supermarkets for other provisions throughout the week. The market also sells yak butter, cheese, wooden bowls and fabrics. A number of cheap souvenirs from Nepal are also sold at the market. Behind the open market, several shops sell Chinese and Bangladeshi crockery, appliances, shoes, silks and carpets. For many years merchants would come to the central square from all over Bhutan and market their goods and would sleep in the open air. However, in 1986, platforms were erected and in 1989 covered market halls were built over the platforms. A special building for meat products was constructed on the north side of the market. In 2006, the handicrafts section was moved to the new stalls on the other side of the new bridge, built in the traditional style in 2005.

The Loden Foundation, Bhutan&#x27;s first registered charity, has been based in Thimphu since 2007. It is run by a board of trustees composed of prominent citizens, and the foundation has a working team in the United Kingdom (UK). The organisation was established to support education and promote learning and entrepreneurship in Bhutan and other Himalayan areas and to promote Bhutanese culture and religion in other parts of the world.

===Tourism===
Initially, when Bhutan was opened up for tourism in 1974, the Government-owned Tourism Corporation was set up in Thimphu to encourage and organise individual and group tours to destinations of cultural importance in Bhutan, concentrating on Buddhism, weaving, birds, nature and trekking, and any special package. This organization was privatised in 1994 and named as Bhutan Tourism Development Corporation. The corporation also owns and manages hotels and tourist lodges at all major tourist centres in Bhutan. It has its own fleet of cars and also interpreters in several international languages to cater to tourists from various countries.
Thimphu does not have a vibrant night life but the number of nightclubs and pool rooms for young people is growing quickly.
The main street, Norzim Lam, contains a number of shops and small hotels and restaurants. The Bhutan Textile Museum, the National Library, the Chang Lam Plaza and the sports field are buildings of note around this street area. Near the main square is a clock, decorated with dragons, which is now an open-air theatre site and art and craft stores and the Tashi supermarket. In the building in front of the old cinema there is a Chinese restaurant and trekking stores.

The Drentoen Lam street is located off the main street and contains the post office and bank and administrative buildings and several music stores. Doebum Lam road runs parallel to the main Norzim Lam and also contains the Chamber of Commerce, Department of Tourism and the Ministry of Trade buildings and the odd bakery. In 2006, a new shopping district opened between Doebum Lam and Norzim Lam which includes the Zangdopelri shopping complex, the Phuntsho Pelri Hotel and Seasons, an Italian restaurant.

==Government and civic administration==
As the capital of Bhutan, most of the important political institutions in the country are based in Thimphu, including the embassies and the National Assembly of Bhutan. The National Assembly has 47 members, who were elected in the first ever general elections on March 24, 2008. Jigme Thinley&#x27;s Druk Phuensum Tshogpa Party won a landslide victory, securing 45 seats. The People&#x27;s Democratic Party won the other two, but its leader Sangay Ngedup lost the election in his constituency.

===Civic administration===

The Civic Administration of Thimphu city is the responsibility of the Thimphu Municipal Corporation (TMC). 
It was established in 1995 through a royal decree. It became an autonomous corporation in 1999, following the enactment of the Municipal Act of 1999. Its headquarters is at the Lungtenzampa zone of Thimphu. The corporation is headed by a mayor (Dasho Nima Wangdi) who is called &quot;Thrompon&quot; in the Bhutanese language. The mayor is appointed by the Ministry of Works and Human Settlement (MoWHS). 
An executive committee comprising 17 members governs the corporation; 8 members are elected from 6 zones and 7 members are nominated from government organizations and meet nearly every 6 weeks. However, its capacity to deal with the problems is hindered by lack of adequate staff (without any proportionate increase in staff strength to deal with its large jurisdiction) and its expenditure far outstrips the revenue earned. In order to provide cost effective services, the Corporation (as the regulating body) has contemplated privatization of public services, particularly water supply, solid waste, sewerage and parking.

===Civic amenities===
Thimphu metropolitan area has all the basic amenities. Further additions and improvements have been planned and are under implementation, as part of the ‘Thimphu Structured Plan’. Water Supply, sanitation and health care have been fully addressed.

====Water supply and sanitation====

Service-oriented municipal corporations have been established in the two biggest urban centres in Bhutan namely, Thimphu and Phuentsholing. Thimphu Municipal Corporation (TMC) is the service organization that has the mandate for executing urban water supply and sanitation programmes in Thimphu city. TMC is an autonomous ‘Civic Body’ under the municipal charter granted in 2003, as per the Bhutan Municipal Act of 1999. However, the overall responsibility to formulate strategies and policies for human settlement in the country rests with the Ministry of Works and Human Settlement of the central government, as the nodal agency, with its subordinate Department of Urban Development and Engineering Services made responsible for executing urban water supply and sanitation programmes.

Access to potable water is available to 90% of the population in Thimphu, though water supply is intermittent, attributed to leakage and high consumer demand.

Conventional piped sewerage with lagoon treatment has been installed in the core areas of Thimphu with coverage of about 70%. However, the urban sanitation issues that have been flagged for action are: to ensure provision of flush toilets or latrines with proper septic tanks and soak pits in all new houses; dismantling VIP latrines and long drop toilets; to provide piped sewerage and wastewater treatment plants in all urban areas, allocation of funds for piped sewerage and treatment plant and awareness campaign on basic sanitation.

Thimphu also has an organised waste collection and disposal system. However, the quantum of waste generation in the city, which has about 6,982 households and 1,000 institutions, was projected to double in the period 2000–2010. At present, the solid waste disposal is at the sanitary landfill site, which may become inadequate soon. This problem is intended to be addressed by minimizing waste generation and adopting proper waste segregation methods.

==Law and order==

Law and order in Thimphu and in the country as a whole are the responsibility of the Royal Bhutan Police (RBP), a national police branch of the armed forces, established in Thimphu in September 1965 when 555 personnel were reassigned from the Royal Bhutan Army. The organization is responsible for law and order, traffic control, and crime prevention. In 1988, a fingerprint bureau was established in Thimphu, for which a female second lieutenant received specialized training. Bhutan became a member of Interpol on 19 September 2005; since then, Interpol has maintained a National Central Bureau at RBP headquarters in Thimphu.

The RBP is headed by a chief of police who is under the control of the Ministry of Home and Cultural Affairs. He is assisted by a deputy chief of police. The headquarters of the RBP is located in the capital city of Thimphu and is divided into three branches directly under the chief of police. The RBP has grouped districts into &quot;ranges,&quot; which are under the administrative control of range police officers. A district police officer heads the police force in a district. There are a number of police stations, outposts, and checkpoints in a district; the highest-ranking officer is usually designated the officer in charge of that particular area. Thimphu district and the city fall under Range I. Recruits are trained at the police training centres in Zilnon, Namgyeling–Thimphu, Jigmeling–Gelephu, and Tashigatshel–Chukha.

==Health care==
Basic health facilities are provided free of any charge to all citizens in Bhutan. There are no private practitioners operating any clinics anywhere in Thimphu or Bhutan. Every citizen is treated free of any charge including foreign tourists needing medical care. The health care centre established in Thimphu is the National Referral Hospital. &#x27;Traditional Medicine&#x27; is also in vogue and the &quot;Institute of Traditional Medicine&quot; has been set up in Thimphu to promote this widely practiced herbal medical cure in rural areas of Bhutan.

;National Referral Hospital
The National Referral Hospital (full name &quot;Jigme Dorji Wangchuck National Referral Hospital&quot;) in Thimphu was established in 1972 and is the main hospital in Bhutan. The National Referral Hospital provides free basic medical treatment as well as advanced surgeries and emergency services to citizens from all over the country. The hospital provides sophisticated health evaluation and management services in the country and has facilities of CT and MRI diagnosis equipment and improved lab services. The hospital has a library with many textbooks. The hospital is one of five medical service centres within Thimphu. The others are: two Indian hospitals (DANTAK hospital at Semtokha and IMTRAT hospital in the main town), the BHU in Dechencholing and the Outreach Clinic in Motithang.

;Institute of Traditional Medicine
The Institute of Traditional Medicine was set up in 1979 with assistance from World Health Organization (WHO) to develop and popularise Bhutanese herbal medicine, which has been used by the rural people in Bhutan for many centuries. The institute is located on a hill promontory above the Thimpu town. It is a semi-wooden structure built colourfully like a &quot;Manor House&quot;. Traditionally, Bhutanese medicine has been influenced by traditional Tibetan medicine and also some aspects of Indian medicine, particularly the &quot;Three Humors of bile, wind and phlegm&quot; that &quot;dictates the state of our physical and spiritual health.&quot; The institute is well manned by scientists who claim that they have now developed a &quot;mixture of five herbs that could &quot;possess spermogenitic powers&quot; (a kind of a herbal viagra), which is under testing before development and marketing on a commercial basis. The main herb used is stated to be Cordyceps sinensis (caterpillar fungus), whose productive buds are available in the hills of Bhutan.

=== Lama Shenphen Zangpo ===
Lama Shenphen is a monk, author and social worker in Thimphu, who has worked with troubled youth since 1998. He was born in Swansea, United Kingdom, but spent more than 28 years practicing and studying Buddhism in Taiwan and Japan. He also teaches meditation and organizes drug outreach programs from the popular Ambient Cafe, on Norzin Lam, the main street of Thimphu.

In 2015, lama Shephen was awarded the National order of merit, Gold, by His Majesty the King in recognition for his contribution in mentoring Bhutanese youth.

==Culture==
The culture of Bhutan is fully reflected in the capital city in respect of literature, religion, customs, and national dress code, the monastic practices, music, dance, literature and in the media. Modernity has been blended without sacrificing on the traditional Buddhist ethos.

; Literature
Ancient literature of Bhutan is preserved in the National Library. The script used in Bhutanese literature is in the Bhutanese script (though evolved from Tibetan script) known as &quot;jo yig&quot; developed in the 16th century. The printing process of these books on handmade paper and its binding are display items at the National Library. Modern literature is still evolving and a religious biography of women titled &quot;delog&quot; is a popular religious work. There are many writers who write in English now, mostly short stories and collection of folk tales of Bhutan; a popular author is Kunzang Choeden.

;Royal Academy of Performing Arts
The Royal Academy of Performing Arts (RAPA), located in Thimphu, was established at the initiative of late King, Jigme Dorji Wangchuck in 1954, with the basic objective of preserving and promoting performing arts traditions of Bhutan. In 1967, it was institutionalised as an academy and the Royal Dance troupe was its creation. The institution provides training in national dance forms of Bhutan such as mask dances and also preserves the folk dance heritage. The professional dancers of the academy hold performances during the annual Thimphu Tsechu dance festival that is held in the premises of the Tashichhoe Dzong. Performances lasting for one hour are also arranged on specially requested occasions. The present activities at the academy are being reorganised with further expansion of its programs, including curriculum development for teaching.

;National Library
Established in 1967, built in the style of a traditional temple, the National Library houses many ancient Dzonghka and Tibetan texts. It has been planned as &quot;a major scriptural repository and research facility dedicated to the preservation and promotion of the rich literary, cultural and religious heritage&quot; of Bhutan. The building is very lavishly decorated and is said to represent the finest vibrant Bhutanese architecture. On the ground floor of this building, among the highly prized collections, there is a book reported to be the heaviest in the world, weighing , known as &quot;Bhutan:a Visual Odyssey Across the Last Himalayan Kingdom &quot;. Traditional books and historic manuscripts written in Tibetan style, on handmade paper bound between wooden flats and tied together are also preserved here. The library also houses an old printing press that was used for printing books and prayer flags. The library is also circumambulated by devotees as a mark of worship by the devout as it enshrines holy books and images of Bhutan&#x27;s famous people such as the Zhabdrung, Namgyal, Pema Linga and Guru Rinpoche. Also on display here are a model of the Punakha Dzong and the Chorten architecture.

;Music

The music of Bhutan has traditional genres such as zhungdra and boedra. The influence of Drukpa Buddhism and Buddhist music on Bhutanese culture is important. Many folk songs and chanting styles are derived from Drukpa music. In the 17th century, during the reign of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal (1594–1652) great blossoming of folk music and dance (cham) took place. Instruments dating to this time include the lingm (flute), dramnyen (lute) and chiwang(fiddle). &quot;Ynagchen&quot; is an instrument made from hollow wood with 72 strings that are &quot;struck with two bamboo sticks.&quot; Rigsar music has become popular in Thimphu and Bhutan and is performed on electric piano and synthesiser. It is, however, a fusion of traditional Bhutanese and Tibetan tunes and is also influenced by Hindi music. The music albums are produced by many popular Bhutanese male and female singers not only in Rigsar music but also in traditional folk songs and religious songs. Four music CDs of religious folk music, called the &#x27;Tibetan Buddhist Rites&#x27; released by the monasteries with a recording sung by a &quot;manip&quot; (a traveling ascetic) that reminisces the arrival of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal in Bhutan in the 17th century is popular.

To promote music in Bhutan, two music schools have been established in Thimphu, namely, the Kilu Music School and the recently established the Himalayan School of Music. The Kilu Music School, established in March 2005, is the first of its kind in Thimpu where students are taught the essentials of music such as: to practice their music reading and writing skills, and to improve their listening skills.

Kheng Sonam Dorji of Kaktong village of Zhemgang District, is a renowned and committed musician, vocalist, and composer who resides in Thimphu. He plays several instruments native to Bhutan and India. He learnt &quot;drangyen&quot; under the elders of Bhutanese folk tradition. His contributions to Bhutanese culture include a string of hit Rigsar (Bhutanese pop) albums and the sound tracks of the popular Bhutanese film, &quot;Travellers and Magicians (2004)&quot;. He also participated at the Smithsonian&#x27;s Festival of American Folklife (2008).

;Cinema
Films made in Bhutan are very few. Quality of films produced is in a stage of improvement. National Film awards are presented in functions held in Thimphu to encourage Bhutanese film making. The only cinema hall in Thimphu, the Luger Cinema Hall, screens Bhutanese and Hindi movies; occasionally English/foreign-language movies are also screened here.

;Thimphu Tsechu Festival

Mask dances, popularly known as Cham dances, are performed in the courtyards of the Tashichhoe Dzong in Thimphu during the four-day Tsechu festival, held every year during Autumn (September/October) on dates corresponding to the Bhutanese calendar. Tsechu means &quot;tenth&quot;, so the festival is held on the 10th day of Bhutanese month. It is a religious folk dance form of Drukpa Buddhism, which was established in 1670. Tsechus are a series of dances performed by monks and also trained dance troupes to honour the deeds of Padmasambahva alias Guru Rinpoche. They are also social events when people turn up in their best attire, with women particularly bejeweled, and large numbers witness the ritual dances and also absorb the religious teachings on Buddhism. It is performed in each district in Bhutan at different periods; the Thimphu Tsechu and the Paro Tsechu are the most popular. The Thimphu Tsechu, held for four days is usually attended by the royal family and the Chief Abbot of Bhutan and other government officials. The opening day and concluding days are important and each day has a set programme. These colourfully costumed, masked dances (performed mostly by monks) typically are moral vignettes, or based on incidents from the life of the 9th century Nyingmapa teacher Padmasambhava and other saints.

;Nightlife
A nightlife has begun to develop in Thimphu. Nightclubs have begun to spring up in the city. Thimphu&#x27;s nightclubs have a reputation for high-quality ambience, entertainment, food, and music, and have hosted prominent Western celebrities.

===Arts and crafts===

The arts and crafts of Bhutan that represents the exclusive &quot;spirit and identity of the Himalayan kingdom’ is defined as the art of &quot;Zorig Chosum&quot;, which means the &quot;thirteen arts and crafts of Bhutan&quot;. The arts and crafts produced in Thimphu and other places in Bhutan include textiles, paintings, sculptures, paper making, wood carving, sword making and blacksmithing, boot making, bamboo craft, bow and arrow making and jewelry.:

; National Institute of Zorig Chusum
The National Institute of Zorig Chusum is the centre for Bhutanese Art education. It was set up by the Government of Bhutan with the sole objective of preserving the rich culture and tradition of Bhutan and training students in all traditional art forms. Painting is the main theme of the institute, which provides 4–6 years of training in Bhutanese traditional art forms. The curricula cover a comprehensive course of drawing, painting, wood carving, embroidery, and carving of statues. Images of Buddha are a popular painting done here.

; Handicrafts emporiums

There is a large government run emporium close to the National Institute of Zorig Chusum, which deals with exquisite handicrafts, traditional arts and jewelry; &quot;Gho&quot; and &quot;Kira&quot;, the national dress of Bhutanese men and women, are available in this emporium. The town has many other privately owned emporiums which deal with thangkas, paintings, masks, brassware, antique jewellery, painted lama tables known as &quot;choektse&quot;, drums, Tibetan violins and so forth. Zangma Handicrafts Emporium, in particular, sells handicrafts made in the Institute of Zorig Chusum.
; Folk Heritage Museum

Folk Heritage Museum in Kawajangsa, Thimphu is built on the lines of a traditional Bhutanese farm house with more than 100-year-old vintage furniture. It is built as a three storied structure with rammed mud walls and wooden doors, windows and roof covered with slates. It reveals much about Bhutanese rural life. 
; Voluntary Artists Studio
Located in an innocuous building, the Voluntary Artist Studio&#x27;s objective is to encourage traditional and contemporary art forms among the youth of Thimphu who are keen to imbibe these art forms. The works of these young artists are also available on sale in the &#x27;Art Shop Gallery&#x27; of the studio.

; National Textile Museum
The National Textile Museum in Thimphu displays various Bhutanese textiles that are extensive and rich in traditional culture. It also exhibits colourful and rare kiras and ghos (traditional Bhutanese dress, kira for women and gho for men).

==Religion==

Vajrayana Buddhism is the state religion and the dominant ethnic group is Drukpa of Kagyu Buddhism, while in southern Bhutan Hindus of Nepali ethnicity are dominant. The main monastic body with membership of 1,160 monks is headed by a chief abbot (presently Je Khenpo) who spends six months in Tashichhoe Dzong in Thimphu and the other six months in Punakha. A Council of Ecclesiastical Affairs, under the chairmanship of the chief abbot, is located in Thimphu, which is responsible for the management of the National Memorial Chorten in Thimphu, and all Buddhist meditation centres, schools of Buddhist studies and also central and district monastic bodies. The day-to-day affairs of the council are under the charge of the chief abbot.

==Education==

It was only in the 1960s that roads were built in Bhutan and Thimphu when the Third King of Bhutan took the initiative after receiving education in it. Prior to that, education was limited to monastic teachings in monasteries, except for a few privileged people who went to Darjeeling to receive western-type education. Dzongkha is compulsory in all schools. Schools are co-educational and education is not compulsory but school education is virtually free. Now, education has spread to all parts of the country. Thimphu has several educational institutions from schooling level to the college level in several disciplines. There are more private schools in Thimphu than in any other place in Bhutan, which are all under the control of the Department of Education. The National Training Authority administers three technical institutes.

The Royal University of Bhutan (known as the RUB) located in the city was established in 2003.
This university includes several colleges including the Institute for Language and Culture Studies (ILCS) which provides training to undergraduate students in national language, culture and traditions of Bhutan at Simtokha Dzong. Students who graduate from this school primarily become Dzongkha teachers. Also included is the Royal Institute of Health Sciences (RIHS), which provides training to nurses and technicians, and the Royal Institute of Management (RIM) which provides training in administrative and financial management to mid-level manager. Aside from the government run colleges, private schools and colleges have also been set up in Thimphu and other regions of the country.

With World Bank funding, an IT Park is proposed in an area of , in of land at Babesa, within Thimphu&#x27;s municipal limits. This facility shall have an incubation centre, shared technology centre and data centre without any manufacturing facility. It is a joint venture project of Thimphu Tech Park Pvt. Ltd., of Assetz Property Group Pvt. Ltd., of Singapore and Druk Holding &amp; Investments Ltd of Bhutan.

==Transport==

===Roads===
The layout and position of the city roads in Thimphu are dictated by its unique topography. Most premier roads, typically wide, are aligned in a north–south direction, parallel to the river; the most important artery is the Norzin Lam (&quot;Lam&quot; - road/street). Branch roads wind along the hill slopes leading to residential areas. Footpaths are also well laid with access to the commercial areas and the Wang Chu River. However, its entry point is at a narrow location from the south crossed by a wooden bridge. South of the bridge is the road to Paro, Punakha, Wangdue Phodrang, Tongsa and further to the east and north. The expressway which has been built has had a large impact on development, shifting land values, decreasing transportation costs, and increasing potential growth opportunity in the southern part of the valley.

Bhutan Transport Corporation runs a regular bus service from Siliguri (which along with nearby New Jalpaiguri station are the nearest railheads) in India. It takes about four hours to reach Phuentsholing. From there, buses ply to Thimphu every day. Taxis can also be hired.

The unique aspect of Thimphu roads and the traffic control over the road network is that it is one of the two national capitals in the world that does not have traffic lights (the other is Ngerulmud, Palau). Local authorities had installed a set of lights but before they became operational the lights were removed. Instead of traffic lights, the city takes pride in its traffic police that directs the oncoming traffic with their dance-like movement of their arms and hands. City Bus services operate throughout the day. There are plans to introduce tram services in the city.

===Air===

Thimphu is served by the only international airport of Bhutan, Paro Airport, which is about away by road. Druk Air had its headquarters in Thimphu but now there is only a branch office. Druk Air is one of only two airlines flying into Bhutan excluding charter flights by Buddha Air and is a lifeline with the outside world for the Bhutanese people, also supporting emerging inbound tourism and export markets. The airline has in recent times been criticised for its unreliability, particularly from the Bhutanese tourism industry which is still in its infancy, and regards the very company upon which it relies as its biggest threat. Tashi Air is a more recent private airline in the country, commencing operations in 2011.

==Sports==
The Bhutan Olympic Committee was created in November 1983 with the King of Bhutan as its president, with its headquarters in Thimphu. Following this recognition, Bhutan participated for the first time in the 1984 Olympic Games held in Los Angeles when three men and three women archers represented Bhutan. For each Olympic Summer Games since 1984, Bhutan has fielded male and female archers. They have never competed in the Winter Games; they also have never won an Olympic medal.

Archery (&quot;datse&quot;) is the national sport of Bhutan, which is played not only with traditional bows and arrows but also with modern archery techniques at the Changlimithang Sports and Archery Stadium in Thimphu. Archery is central to the cultural identity of the nation and as a result all tournaments are started with a ceremony. Women come to witness the sports in their colourful best attire and cheer their favorite teams. Men stand close to the target and taunt the players, if targets are missed. The targets are spaced at intervals. Teams which win the tournaments celebrate with their supporters by singing and performing a dance jig. Archery is organized nationally within the Bhutan Archery Federation.
Since monks are not permitted to participate in archery they indulge in another popular sports called the &quot;daygo&quot; - a stone throwing sport, which involves throwing flat circular stone like a discus. Another shot put type game known as &quot;pungdo&quot; is popular and is also played with big and heavy stones. One more typical Bhutanese game is the dart game, known locally as &quot;Khuru&quot;, which is played with short targets. The darts used in the game are made of a wood block set with a nail with fins of chicken feather.

Many modern sports are also played in the national stadium in Thimphu, in addition to locally popular sports mentioned earlier. The sports activities in vogue are football, basketball, golf, &quot;Kwon do&quot; (Bhutan earned a gold medal in this game in the South Asia Federation Games in 2004), squash, golf (popular among the elite middle class) and in recent years cricket. Thimphu has 12 cricket teams and two small golf courses; one near the India House and the other between the Tashichhoe Dzong and the National Library, known as the Royal Thimphu Golf Course (a nine-hole course), established at the initiative of King Jigme Dorji Wangchuk in 1971.

;Changlimithang Stadium

Changlimithang Stadium, a multi-purpose stadium in Thimphu, is the National Stadium. The stadium that was built in 1974 to celebrate the Coronation of the fourth Druk Gyalpo, King Jigme Singye Wangchuck in 1974. It had a capacity to hold 10,000 spectators. However, it was completely refurbished in 2007 to accommodate 25,000 spectators for the Centenary of Wangchuk dynasty rule in Bhutan and also the Coronation Celebrations of the fifth king of Bhutan, Jigme Khesar Namgyal Wangchuck, held on November 6, 2008. It now covers an area of about . This was also the location where national celebrations were held from the time of the third King of Bhutan. Historicity of the Changlimithang ground is traced to the 1885 battle that established the political supremacy of Gongsar Ugyen Wangchuck, Bhutan&#x27;s first king. Adjacent to the main stadium are the football ground, the cricket field and archery range. Numerous archery tournaments are held here with both the imported compound bows and traditional bamboo bows. The main stadium is used for multipurpose sports and other functions. A documentary film known as &quot;The Other Final&quot; was filmed based on a special football match arranged by FIFA that was played between the 202nd placed (out of 203 worldwide) Bhutan and 203rd-ranked Montserrat.

==Media==

The Bhutan Broadcasting Service was established in 1973 as a radio service, broadcasting on short wave nationally, and on the FM band, in Thimphu. It is run by the Government of Bhutan. The service started television broadcasts and satellite channels in 1999, during the coronation of the fourth king of Bhutan. Bhutan was then the last country in the world to introduce television. As part of the King&#x27;s modernization program, cable television was introduced shortly after. In 2002, there were 42 TV channels under two cable operators.

&quot;Kuensel&quot; was first started in Thimphu as a government bulletin in 1965, and then became a national weekly in 1986 and was the only newspaper in Bhutan until 2006 when two other newspapers, namely the &quot;Bhutan Times&quot; and &quot;Bhutan Observer&quot;, were introduced. &quot;Kuensel&quot;, which was initially government-owned, became an autonomous corporation incorporating the Royal Government Press, in 1992. It publishes the newspaper &quot;Kuensel&quot; in English, Nepali and Dzongkha (Bhutanese) languages.

Radio Valley FM. 99.9, a new private radio station, has started broadcasting in Thimphu. This is in addition to the older stations of BBS and Kuzoo FM.

<doc id="57659" wikidata="Q3572" url="?curid=57659" title="Tunis">
<text>Tunis (, &quot;&quot;) is the capital and largest city of Tunisia. The greater metropolitan area of Tunis, often referred to as &quot;Grand Tunis&quot;, has about 2,700,000 inhabitants. , it is the third-largest city in the Maghreb region (after Casablanca and Algiers) and the eleventh-largest in the Arab world.

Situated on the Gulf of Tunis, behind the Lake of Tunis and the port of La Goulette (Ḥalq il-Wād), the city extends along the coastal plain and the hills that surround it. At its core lies the Medina, a World Heritage Site. East of the Medina, through the Sea Gate (also known as the &quot;Bab el Bhar&quot; and the &quot;Porte de France&quot;), begins the modern part of the city called &quot;Ville Nouvelle&quot;, traversed by the grand Avenue Habib Bourguiba (often referred to by media and travel guides as &quot;the Tunisian Champs-Élysées&quot;), where the colonial-era buildings provide a clear contrast to smaller, older structures. Further east by the sea lie the suburbs of Carthage, La Marsa, and Sidi Bou Said.

As the capital of the country, Tunis is the focus of Tunisian political and administrative life and also the center of the country&#x27;s commercial and cultural activities.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Tunis&quot; is the transcription of the Arabic name which can be pronounced as &quot;Tūnus&quot;, &quot;Tūnas&quot;, or &quot;Tūnis&quot;. All three variations were mentioned by the 12th-century Arab geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi in his &quot;Mu&#x27;jam al-Bûldan&quot; (&quot;Dictionary of Countries&quot;).

Different explanations exist for the origin of the name &quot;Tunis&quot;. Some scholars relate it to the Carthaginian goddess &quot;Tanith&quot; (&#x27;Tanit or Tanut), as many ancient cities were named after patron deities. Some scholars claim that it originated from &quot;Tynes&quot;, which was mentioned by Diodorus Siculus and Polybius in the course of descriptions of a location resembling present-day Al-Kasbah, Tunis&#x27;s old Berber village.

Another possibility is that it was derived from the Berber verbal root &quot;ens&quot; which means &quot;to lie down&quot; or &quot;to pass the night&quot;. The term &quot;Tunis&quot; can possibly mean &quot;camp at night&quot;, &quot;camp&quot;, or &quot;stop&quot;, or may have referred to as &quot;the last stop before Carthage&quot; by people who were journeying to Carthage by land. There are also some mentions in ancient Roman sources of such names of nearby towns as &quot;Tuniza&quot; (now El Kala), &quot;Thunusuda&quot; (now Sidi-Meskin), &quot;Thinissut&quot; (now Bir Bouregba), and &quot;Thunisa&quot; (now Ras Jebel). As all of these Berber villages were situated on Roman roads, they undoubtedly served as rest-stations or stops.

==History==
===Carthage and early settlements===

The historical study of Carthage is problematic. Because its culture and records were destroyed by the Romans at the end of the Third Punic War, very few Carthaginian primary historical sources survive. While there are a few ancient translations of Punic texts into Greek and Latin, as well as inscriptions on monuments and buildings discovered in Northwest Africa, the main sources are Greek and Roman historians, including Livy, Polybius, Appian, Cornelius Nepos, Silius Italicus, Plutarch, Dio Cassius, and Herodotus. These writers belonged to peoples in competition, and often in conflict, with Carthage. Greek cities contended with Carthage over Sicily, and the Romans fought three wars against Carthage. Not surprisingly, their accounts of Carthage are extremely hostile; while there are a few Greek authors who took a favourable view, these works have been lost. The area was originally a Berber settlement. The existence of settlements in and around the area of Tunis is attested by sources dating from the 4th century BC. Situated on a hill, its location served as an excellent point from which the comings and goings of naval and caravan traffic to and from Carthage could be observed. It was one of the first towns in the region to fall under Carthaginian control, and in the centuries that followed the settlement was mentioned in the military histories associated with Carthage. Thus, during Agathocles&#x27; expedition, which landed at Cape Bon in 310 BC, the town changed hands on various occasions.

During the Mercenary War, it is possible that the town served as a center for the native population of the area, and that its population was mainly composed of peasants, fishermen, and craftsmen. Compared to the ancient ruins of Carthage, the town&#x27;s ancient ruins are not as large. According to Strabo, it was destroyed by the Romans in 146 BC during the Third Punic War. Both the town and Carthage were destroyed; the former, however, was rebuilt first under the rule of Augustus and became an important town under Roman control and the center of a booming agricultural industry. The township is mentioned as &quot;Thuni&quot; in the Tabula Peutingeriana. In the system of Roman roads for the Roman province of Africa, the town had the title of (&quot;way station, resting place&quot;). The borough, increasingly Romanized, was also eventually Christianized and became the seat of a bishop. However, it remained modestly sized compared to Carthage during this time.

===Foundation and early Islamic period===

In the late 7th century, the Arab Muslims conquered the region, and in 698 a commune and a mosque were established at the outskirts of the ancient ruins, founded by Hassan ibn al-Nu&#x27;man, which would become the city of Tunis and the Zaytuna Mosque. The Medina of Tunis, the oldest section of the city, dates from this period, during which the region was conquered by the Umayyad Caliphate. The city had the natural advantage of coastal access, via the Mediterranean, to the major ports of southern Europe. Early on, Tunis played a military role; the Umayyads recognized the strategic importance of its proximity to the Strait of Sicily, with a dockyard built upon the founding of the city by order of Caliph Abd al-Malik. From the beginning of the 8th century, Tunis was the &quot;chef-lieu&quot; of the area: it became the Umayyad, and later the Abbasids&#x27; naval base in the western Mediterranean Sea, and took on considerable military importance. Under the Aghlabids, the city gained significance and benefited from economic improvements and became one of the most important in the caliphate, and was briefly the national capital from the end of the reign of Ibrahim II, from 902 until 909, when control over Ifriqiya was handed to the newly founded Fatimid Caliphate.

Local opposition to the authorities began to intensify in September 945, when Kharijite insurgents occupied Tunis, resulting in general pillaging. With the rise of the Fatimid-viceregal Zirid dynasty the Sunni population tolerated Shi&#x27;ite rule less and less, and carried out massacres against the Shi&#x27;ite community. In 1048 the Zirid ruler Al-Muizz ibn Badis rejected his city&#x27;s obedience to the Fatimids and re-established Sunni rites throughout all of Ifriqiya. This decision infuriated the Fatimid Caliph Al-Mustansir Billah. To punish the Zirids, he unleashed the Banu Hilal Arab tribe on Ifriqiya; a large part of the country was set to the torch, the Zirid capital Kairouan was razed in 1057, and only a few coastal towns, including Tunis and Mahdia, escaped destruction.

Exposed to violence from the hostile tribes that settled around the city, the population of Tunis repudiated the authority of the Zirids and swore allegiance to the Hammadid prince El Nacer ibn Alennas, who was based in Béjaïa, in 1059. The governor appointed by Béjaïa, having reestablished order in the country, did not hesitate to free himself from the Hammadids to found the Khurasanid dynasty with Tunis as its capital. This small independent kingdom picked up the threads of trade and commerce with other nations and brought the region back to peace and prosperity.

===New capital of Tunisia===
In 1159, the Almohad &#x27;Abd al-Mu&#x27;min took Tunis, overthrew the last Khurasanid leader, and installed a new government in the kasbah of Tunis. The Almohad conquest marked the beginning of the dominance of the city in Tunisia. Having previously played a minor role behind Kairouan and Mahdia, Tunis was promoted to the rank of provincial capital.

In 1228, Governor Abu Zakariya seized power and, a year later, took the title of Emir and founded the Hafsid dynasty. The city became the capital of a Hafsid kingdom stretching towards Tripoli and Fez. Walls were built to protect the emerging principal town of the kingdom, surrounding the medina, the kasbah, and the new suburbs of Tunis. In 1270 the city was taken briefly by Louis IX of France, who was hoping to convert the Hafsid sovereign to Christianity. King Louis easily captured Carthage, but his army soon fell victim to an outbreak of dysentery. Louis himself died before the walls of the capital and his army were forced out. At the same time, driven by the reconquest of Spain, the first Andalusian Muslims and Jews arrived in Tunis and would become of importance to the economic prosperity of the Hafsid capital and the development of its intellectual life.

During the Almohad and Hafsid periods, Tunis was one of the richest and grandest cities in the Islamic world, with a population of about 100,000. Like the Almohads, the Hafsids maintained Christian mercenaries who lived in a neighbourhood closed off with a gate near the Hafsid palace complex. They worshipped in a church dedicated to Saint Francis of Assisi which visitors described as &quot;very beautiful and great&quot; and which was allowed to ring the bell, a practice forbidden by the so-called Pact of Umar and a privilege not granted to the Genoese and Venetian merchants who maintained chapels in their merchant quarters. When Jean Adorno visited Tunis in 1470, he described these Christians as assimilated culturally and linguistically into Tunisian society, though they remained Christians and would sing in Latin during mass.

During this period, one of the famous travelers to Tunis was Ibn Battuta. In his travel account, when Ibn Battuta and his group arrived in Tunis, the population of the city came out to meet him and the other members of his party. They all greeted them and were very curious, many were asking questions, however, no one in Tunis personally greeted Ibn Battuta, greatly upsetting him. He felt very lonely and could not hold back the tears coming from his eyes. This went on for a while until one of the pilgrims realized he was upset, he went up and greeted and talked to Ibn Battuta until he entered the city. At the time, the Sultan of Tunis was Abu Yahya and during Ibn Battuta&#x27;s stay, the Festival of the Breaking of the Fast was taking place. The people in the city assembled in large numbers to celebrate the festival, in extravagant and most luxurious outfits. Abu Yahya arrived on horseback, where all of his relatives joined him. After the performance, the people returned to their homes.

===Spanish occupation and Ottoman control===
The Ottoman Empire took nominal control of Tunis in 1534 when Hayreddin Barbarossa captured it from the Hafsid Sultan Mulai Hassan, who fled to the court of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Spain. Charles, suffering losses from the corsairs operating out of Djerba, Tunis, and Algiers, agreed to reinstate Mulai Hassan in exchange for his acceptance of Spanish suzerainty. A naval expedition led by Charles himself was dispatched in 1535, and the city was recaptured. The victory against the corsairs is recorded in a tapestry at the Royal Palace of Madrid. The Spanish governor of La Goulette, Luys Peres Varga, fortified the island of Chikly in the lake of Tunis to strengthen the city&#x27;s defenses between 1546 and 1550. 
The Ottoman Uluç Ali Reis, at the head of an army of janissaries and Kabyles, retook Tunis in 1569. However, following the Battle of Lepanto in 1571, the Spanish under John of Austria succeeded in retaking the city and re-establishing the Hafsid sovereign in October 1573. Following these conflicts, the city finally fell into Ottoman hands in August 1574. Having become an Ottoman province governed by a Pasha who was appointed by the Sultan based in Constantinople, the country attained a degree of autonomy. After 1591, the Ottoman governors (Beys) were relatively independent, and both piracy and trade continued to flourish. Under the rule of deys and beys, the capital sprang into new life. Its population grew by additions from various ethnicities, among which were Moorish refugees from Spain, and economic activities diversified. To traditional industry and trade with distant lands was added the activity of the Barbary pirates, then in their golden age. Profits obtained from the trade in Christian slaves allowed the rulers to build sumptuous structures that revived the architectural heritage of the Middle Ages.

In April 1655 the English admiral Robert Blake was sent to the Mediterranean to extract compensation from states that had been attacking English shipping. Only the Bey of Tunis refused to comply, with the result that Blake&#x27;s fifteen ships attacked the Bey&#x27;s arsenal at Porto Farina (Ghar el Melh), destroying nine Algerian ships and two shore batteries, the first time in naval warfare that shore batteries had been eliminated without landing men ashore.

At the beginning of the 18th century, Tunisia entered into a new period in its history with the advent of the Husainid dynasty. Successive Husainid rulers made great progress in developing the city and its buildings. During this period, the city prospered as a center of commerce. Taking advantage of divisions within the ruling house, Algerians captured Tunis in 1756 and put the country under supervision. Hammouda Bey faced bombardment by the Venetian fleet, and the city experienced a rebellion in 1811. Under the reign of Hussein Bey II, naval defeats by the British (1826) and French (1827) saw the French become increasingly active in the city and in the economy.

Various sources estimate the 19th-century population to have ranged from 90,000 to 110,000 inhabitants. During the later 19th century, Tunis became increasingly populated by Europeans, particularly the French, and immigration dramatically increased the size of the city. This resulted in the first demolition of the old city walls, from 1860, to accommodate growth in the suburbs. The city spilled outside the area of the earlier town and the banks of the lake, and the new districts were modernized with running water (1860), lighting gas (1872), roads, waste collection (1873), and communication with adjacent suburbs and the city center. The crafts and traditional trades declined somewhat, as the newcomers increased trade with Europe, introducing the first modern industries and new forms of urban life.

===Development under the French protectorate===

The creation of the French protectorate in 1881 was a turning point in Tunis&#x27;s history, leading to rapid redevelopment of the city in the span of two to three decades. The city quickly spread out of its fortifications: it divided into a traditional Arab-populated old city, and a new city populated by immigrants, with a different structure from that of the traditional medina. Tunis also benefited from the French construction of a water supply, natural gas and electricity networks, public transport services, and other public infrastructure.

Under French rule, a substantial number of Europeans settled (like the Tunisian Italians); half of the population was European in origin. The city expanded and created new boulevards and neighborhoods.

Tunis was quiet during the First World War. After the war, the city faced new transformations as the modern portion grew in importance and extended its network of boulevards and streets in all directions. In addition, a series of satellite cities emerged on the urban rim and encroached on the municipality of Tunis proper. In the economic sphere, commercial activities expanded and diversified as modern industries continued to grow, while traditional industry continued to decline.

During World War II, Tunis was held by Axis forces from November 1942 to May 1943. It was their last base in Africa, as they retreated towards Sicily after being surrounded by Allied forces from Algeria to the west and from Libya to the east. 
On 7 May 1943, at about 15:30 in the afternoon, Tunis fell to troops of British 1st Army and the U.S. 1st Army, which had defeated the German 5th Panzer Army guarding the city. At midday on 20 May 1943, the Allies held a victory parade on Avenue Maréchal Galliéni, and Avenue Jules Ferry, to signal the end of fighting in North Africa.

Having succeeded in driving the Axis powers out of Tunisia, the Allies used Tunis as a base of operations from which to stage amphibious assaults first against the island of Pantelleria, and then Sicily, and finally the mainland of Italy.

===Growth since independence===
After independence in 1956, Tunis consolidated its role as the capital, first with the establishment of a constitution stating that the Chamber of Deputies and the Presidency of the Republic must have their headquarters in Tunis and its suburbs. In a very short time, the colonial city transformed rapidly. As the city has grown and native Tunisians gradually began to replace the extensive European population, the conflict between the Arab city and the European city has gradually decreased with the arabization of the population.

Because of population pressure and the rate of migration to the capital, the city continued to grow, even with the creation of new districts in the suburbs. Old buildings have gradually been renovated and upgraded. New buildings have come to influence the urban landscape. At the same time, an active policy of industrialization is developing the municipal economy. The Medina of Tunis has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1979.

The Arab League represents 22 Arab nations. It transferred its headquarters to Tunis in 1979 because of Egypt&#x27;s peace with Israel. The Arab League returned to Egypt in 1990.

The Palestine Liberation Organization also had its headquarters in Tunis, from 1982 to 2003. In 1985, the PLO&#x27;s headquarters was bombed by Israeli Air Force F-15s, killing approximately 60 people.

=== 21st century ===
Many protests took place during the Arab Spring of 2011–12.

On 18 March 2015, two gunmen attacked the Bardo National Museum and held hostages. Twenty civilians and one policeman were killed in the attack, while around 50 others were injured. Five Japanese, two Colombians, and visitors from Italy, Poland, and Spain were among the dead. Both gunmen were killed by Tunisian police. The incident has been treated as a terrorist attack.

==Geography==

Tunis is located in north-eastern Tunisia on the Lake of Tunis, and is connected to the Mediterranean sea&#x27;s Gulf of Tunis by a canal which terminates at the port of La Goulette/Halq al Wadi. The ancient city of Carthage is located just north of Tunis along the coastal part. The city lies on a similar latitude as the southernmost points of Europe.

The city of Tunis is built on a hill slope down to the lake of Tunis. These hills contain places such as Notre-Dame de Tunis, Ras Tabia, La Rabta, La Kasbah, Montfleury, and La Manoubia with altitudes just above . The city is located at the crossroads of a narrow strip of land between Lake Tunis and Séjoumi. The isthmus between them is what geologists call the &quot;Tunis dome&quot;, which includes hills of limestone and sediments. It forms a natural bridge and since ancient times several major roads linking to Egypt and elsewhere in Tunisia have branched out from it. The roads also connect with Carthage, emphasizing its political and economic importance not only in Tunisia but more widely in North Africa and the Mediterranean Sea in ancient times.

The Greater Tunis area has an area of , 10% of which are urbanized, the rest being shared between bodies of water ( of lakes or lagoons) and agricultural or natural land (). However, urban growth, which is estimated to be increasing by 500 hectares per year, is gradually changing the landscape with urban sprawl.

=== Suburbs ===
After World War II, suburbs began to rapidly spring up on the outskirts of Tunis. These form a large percentage of the population of the Tunis metropolitan area. It grew from 27% of the total population in 1956, to 37% in 1975 and 50% in 2006.

=== Climate ===
Tunis has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BSh&quot;) bordering a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csa&quot;), characterized by hot and dry, prolonged summers and mild winters with moderate rainfall. The local climate is also affected somewhat by the latitude of the city, the moderating influence of the Mediterranean sea, and the terrain of the hills.

Winter is the wettest season of the year, when more than a third of the annual rainfall falls during this period, raining on average every two or three days. The sun may still increase the temperature from in the morning to in the afternoon on average during the winter. Frosts are rare. The lowest temperature of was recorded on 18 January 1979. In spring, rainfall declines by half. The sunshine becomes dominant in May when it reaches 10 hours a day on average. In March temperatures may vary between , and between in May. However, it is common for temperatures to soar even as early as April with record temperatures reaching . In summer, rain is almost completely absent and the sunlight is at a maximum.

The average temperatures in the summer months of June, July, August, and September are very high. Sea breezes may mitigate the heat, but sometimes the sirocco winds reverse the trend. Occasional thunderstorms in the afternoon can develop quickly, especially after the periods of extremely hot weather. They usually do not produce precipitation (see dry thunderstorm), but may be accompanied by a brief shower. The highest temperature of was recorded at Tunis-Carthage International Airport on July 24, 2023. In autumn, it begins to rain, often with short thunderstorms, which can sometimes cause flash floods or even flood some parts of the city. The month of November marks a break in the general heat with average temperatures ranging from .

==Politics==

===Capital===
Tunis has been the capital of Tunisia since 1159. Under Articles 43 and 24 of the Constitution of 1959, Tunis and its suburbs host the national institutions: the Presidential Palace, which is known as Carthage Palace, residence of the President of Tunisia, the Chamber of Deputies and the Chamber of Advisors and parliament, the Constitutional Council and the main judicial institutions and public bodies. The revised Tunisian Constitution of 2014 similarly provides that the National Assembly is to sit in Tunis (article 51) and that the Presidency is based there (article 73).

===Municipality===

====Institutions====

Following the municipal elections of 6 May 2018, Ennahdha obtained 21 seats out of 60. Nidaa Tounes came second with 17 seats. On 3 July 2018, the head of the Ennahdha list Souad Abderrahim was elected by the council as the new mayor of the capital.

Before 2011, unlike other mayors in Tunisia, the mayor of Tunis was appointed by decree of the President of the Republic from among the members of the City Council.

==== Budget ====
The 2008 budget adopted by the City Council is structured as follows: 61.61 million dinars for operations and 32,516 million dinars for investment. It reflects the improved financial situation of the municipality, the year 2007 was a year registering a surplus in resources that allowed the settlement of debts of the municipality and the strengthening of its credibility with respect its suppliers and public and private partners.

Revenues are generated by the proceeds of taxes on buildings and vacant lots, fees for the rental of municipal property, income from the operation of the public, advertising, and that the fact that the municipality has capital shares in some companies. On the expenditure side, provision is made for the consolidation of hygiene and cleanliness, the state of the environment and urban design, infrastructure maintenance, rehabilitation and renovation of facilities, and strengthening the logistics and means of work and transport.

====Administrative divisions====
The city of Tunis, whose size has increased significantly during the second half of the 20th century, now extends beyond the Tunis Governorate into parts of the governorates of Ben Arous, Ariana and Manouba.

The municipality of Tunis is divided into 15 municipal districts: These include El Bab Bhar, Bab Souika, Cité El Khadra, Jelloud Jebel El Kabaria, El Menzah, El Ouardia, Ettahrir, Ezzouhour, Hraïria, Medina, El Omrane, El Omrane Higher Séjoumi and Sidi El-Bashir.

==Demography==

In the years following independence, the population of the metropolitan area continued to grow: by 21.1% from 1956 to 1966 and by 28.5% from 1966 to 1975 (55.6% between 1956 and 1975). This steady growth was accompanied by changes that affected the nature of the settlement of the capital. Decolonization led to the exodus of some European minorities whose numbers dwindled every year. The gaps created by their departure were filled by Tunisians who emigrated to Tunis from other parts of the country.

The population of the city of Tunis exceeds 2,000,000 inhabitants. After independence, the Tunisian government implemented a plan to cope with the population growth of the city and country, a system of family planning, to attempt to lower the rate of population growth. However, between 1994 and 2004, the population of the governorate of Tunis grew more than 1.03% per annum. It represents, in the 2004 census, 9.9% of the total population of Tunisia. As in the rest of Tunisia, literacy in the region of Tunis evolved rapidly during the second half of the 20th century and has reached a level slightly higher than the national average. The education level is only exceeded by the neighboring governorate of Ariana which has many institutions of education.

== Economy ==
===Overview===

Products include textiles, carpets, and olive oil. Tourism also provides a significant portion of the city&#x27;s income.

Because of the concentration of political authority (headquarters of the central government, presidency, parliament, ministries, and central government) and culture (festivals and mainstream media), Tunis is the only nationally ranking metropolis. Tunis is the heartland of the Tunisian economy and is the industrial and economic hub of the country, home to a third of Tunisian companies—including almost all the head offices of companies with more than fifty employees, with the exception of the Compagnie des Phosphates de Gafsa, headquartered in Gafsa—and produces a third of the national gross domestic product.

Tunis attracts foreign investors (33% of companies, 26% of investments and 27% of employment), excluding several areas due to economic imbalances. According to the Mercer 2017 Cost of Living Rankings, Tunis has the lowest cost of living for expatriates in the world. The urban unemployment rate of university graduates is increasing and the illiteracy rate remains high among the elderly (27% of women and 12% of men). The number of people living below the poverty line, falling at the national level, remains higher in urban areas. In addition, unemployment is high in young people aged 18 to 24, with one in three unemployed as compared to one in six at the national level. In Greater Tunis, the proportion of young unemployed is at 35%.

Gulf finance house or GFH has invested $10 billion in order for the construction of Tunis financial harbor, which will transform Tunisia as the gateway to Africa from Europe. The project hopes to boost the economy of Tunisia as well as increase the number of tourists visiting Tunisia annually. The project is going through planning.

=== Sectors ===
The economic structure of Tunis, as well as that of the country, is overwhelmingly tertiary industry. The city is the largest financial center in the country hosting the headquarters of 65% of financial companies – while the industrial sectors are gradually declining in importance. However the secondary industry is still very represented and Tunis hosts 85% of industrial establishments in the four governorates, with a trend towards the spread of specialized industrial zones in the suburbs.

Primary industry such as agriculture, however, is active in specialized agricultural areas in the suburbs, particularly in the wine and olive oil industries. The generally flat terrain and the two main rivers in Tunisia, the Medjerda to the north and the Milian to the south, the soils are fertile. Tunis has several large plains, the most productive are in Ariana and La Soukra (north), the plain of Manouba (west) and the plain of Mornag (south). In addition, groundwater is easily accessible through the drilling of deep wells, providing water for the different agriculture crops. The soils are heavy and contain limestone in the north but are lighter and sandy containing clay in the south. There is much diversification in the municipality of Tunis, with Durum grown in Manouba, Olives and olive oil in Ariana and Mornag, wine (Mornag), and fruit, vegetable and legumes are grown in all regions.

== Architecture and landscape ==
===Urban landscape===

The Medina, built on a gentle hill slope on the way down to the Lake of Tunis, is the historical heart of the city and home to many monuments, including palaces, such as the Dar Ben Abdallah and Dar Hussein, the mausoleum of Tourbet el Bey and many mosques such as the Al-Zaytuna Mosque. Some of the fortifications around it have now largely disappeared, and it is flanked by the two suburbs of Bab Souika to the north and Bab El Jazira to the south. Located near the Bab Souika, the neighborhood of Halfaouine gained international attention through the film &#x27;Halfaouine Child of the Terraces&#x27;.
But east of the original nucleus, first with the construction of the French Consulate, the modern city was built gradually with the introduction of the French protectorate at the end of the 19th century, on open land between the city and the lake. The axis to the structure of this part of the city is the Avenue Habib Bourguiba, designed by the French to be a Tunisian form of Champs-Élysées in Paris with its cafes, major hotels, shops, and cultural venues. On both sides of the tree lined avenue, north and south, the city was extended in various districts, with the northern end welcoming residential and business districts while the south receives industrial districts and poorer peoples.
South-east of the Avenue Bourguiba the district of La Petite Sicile (Little Sicily) is adjacent to the old port area and takes its name from its original population of workers from Italy. It is now the subject of a redevelopment project including the construction of twin towers. North of the Avenue Bourguiba is the district of La Fayette, which is still home to the Great Synagogue of Tunis and the Habib Thameur Gardens, built on the site of an ancient Jewish cemetery that lay outside the walls. Also to the north is the long Avenue Mohamed V, which leads to the Boulevard of 7 November through the neighborhood of the big banks where there are hotels and Abu Nawas Lake and finally to the Belvedere area around the place Pasteur. This is where the Belvedere Park lies, the largest in the city, and home to a zoo and the Pasteur Institute founded by Adrien Loir in 1893. Continuing to the north are the most exclusive neighborhoods of Mutuelleville which house the French Lycée Pierre-Mendès-France, the Sheraton Hotel, and some embassies.
Still further north of the Belvedere Park, behind the Boulevard of 7 November are the neighborhoods of El Menzah and El Manar now reaching the peaks of the hills overlooking the north of the town. They support a range of residential and commercial buildings. To the west of the park lies the district of El Omrane which holds the main Muslim cemetery in the capital and the warehouses of public transport. Heading east is the Tunis-Carthage International Airport and the neighborhoods of Borgel, giving his name to the existing Jewish and Christian cemeteries in the capital, and the neighborhood of Montplaisir. Beyond that, several kilometers north-east, on the road to La Marsa, the Berges du Lac was built on land reclaimed from the north shore of the lake near the airport, which has held offices of Tunisian and foreign companies, many embassies as well as shops.

Southwest of the Medina, on the crest of the hills across the Isthmus of Tunis, is the Montfleury district then on down to the foothills of Séjoumi, the poor neighbourhood of Mellassine. Northwest of the latter, north of the National Route 3 leading to the west, is the city of Ezzouhour (formerly El Kharrouba), which spans more than and is divided into five sections. It is still surrounded by farmland and vegetables are grown which supply many of the souks in the region.

The south of Tunis is made up of disadvantaged neighbourhoods, especially due to the strong industry in this part of the metropolis. These include Jebel Jelloud, located in the southeast of Tunis, which concentrates on the heavy industry of cement production, the treatment plant of phosphate s, etc. The main cemetery in Tunis, the Djellaz Cemetery, dominates this part of town, perched on the slopes of a rocky outcrop.

=== Médina ===

The medina of Tunis has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1979. The Medina contains some 700 monuments, including palaces, mosques, mausoleums, madrasas, and fountains dating from the Almohad and the Hafsid periods. These ancient buildings include:

* The Aghlabid Al-Zaytouna Mosque (&quot;Mosque of the Olive&quot;) built in 723 by Ubayd Allah ibn al-Habhab to celebrate the new capital.
* The Dar El Bey, or Bey&#x27;s Palace, comprises architecture and decoration from many different styles and periods and is believed to stand on the remains of a Roman theatre as well as the 10th-century palace of Ziadib-Allah II al Aghlab.

With an area of 270 hectares (over 29 hectares for the Kasbah) and more than 100,000 people, the Medina comprises one-tenth of the population of Tunis. The planning of the Medina of Tunis has the distinction of not grid lines or formal geometric compositions. However, studies were undertaken in the 1930s with the arrival of the first anthropologists who found that the space of the Medina is not random: the houses are based on a socio-cultural code according to the types of complex human relations.

Domestic architecture (palaces and townhouses), official and civilian (libraries and administrations), religious (mosques and zaouïas), and services (commercial and fondouks) are located in the Medina. The notion of public space is ambiguous in the case of Medina where the streets are seen as an extension of the houses and subject to social tags. The concept of ownership is low however and souks often spill out onto public roads. Today, each district has its culture, and rivalries can be strong.

The northern end supports the football club of Esperance Sportive de Tunis while at the other end is the rival Club Africain. The Medina also has a social sectorization: with the neighborhood of Tourbet el Bey and the Kasbah district being aristocratic, with a population of judges and politicians, while the streets of Pacha often being military and bourgeois.

Founded in 698 is the Al-Zaytuna Mosque and the surrounding area which developed throughout the Middle Ages, dividing Tunis into a main town in two suburbs, in the north (Bab Souika) and the south (Bab El Jazira). The area became the capital of a powerful kingdom during the Hafsid era and was considered a religious and intellectual home and economic center for the Middle East, Africa, and Europe. A great fusion of influences can be seen blending Andalusian styles with eastern influences, and Roman or Byzantine columns, and typical Arab architecture, characterized by the archways.
The architectural heritage is also omnipresent in the homes of individuals and small palace officials as well as in the palace of the sovereign of Kasbah. Although some palaces and houses date back to the Middle Ages, a greater number of prestigious houses were built in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries such as Dar Othman (early 17th century), Dar Ben Abdallah (18th century), Dar Hussein, Dar Cherif and other houses. The main palace beys are those of La Marsa, Bardo, and Ksar Said. If we add the mosques and oratories (about 200), the madrasahs (El Bachia, Slimania, El Achouria, Bir El Ahjar, Ennakhla, etc..), The zaouias (Mahrez Sidi Sidi Ali Azouz, Sidi Abdel Kader, etc.) and Tourbet El Fellari, Tourbet Aziza Othman and Tourbet El Bey the number of monuments in Tunis approaches 600. Unlike Algiers, Palermo and Naples, its historical heart has never suffered from major natural disasters or urban radical interventions. The main conflicts and potentially destructive human behavior has been experienced in the city occurred relatively recently following the country&#x27;s independence which is why it made into a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1979. At the beginning of the 21st century, the Medina is one of the best-preserved urban locations in the Arab world.

Furthermore, along the boulevards, the contribution of the architectural period 1850–1950 can be felt in the buildings, such as the government buildings of the nine ministries and the headquarters of the municipality of Tunis.

===Other landmarks===
* The Bardo Museum was originally a 13th-century Hafsid palace, located in the (then) suburbs of Tunis. It contains a major collection of Roman empires and other antiquities of interest from Ancient Greece, Tunisia, and the Arab period.
* The ruins of Carthage are nearby, along the coast to the northeast, with many ancient ruins.

====Souks====
The souks are a network of covered streets lined with shops and traders and artisans ordered by specialty. Clothing merchants, perfumers, fruit sellers, booksellers, and wool merchants have goods at the souks, while fishmongers, blacksmiths, and potters tend to be relegated to the periphery of the markets.

North of the Al-Zaytuna Mosque is the Souk El Attarine, built in the early 18th century. It is known for its essences and perfumes. From this souk, there is a street leading to the Souk Ech-Chaouachine (chachia). The main company that operates it is one of the oldest in the country and they are generally descendants of Andalusian immigrants expelled from Spain. Attached to El Attarine are two other souks: the first, which runs along the western coast of the Al-Zaytuna Mosque, is the Souk El Kmach which is noted for its fabrics, and the second, the Souk El Berka, which was built in the 17th century and houses embroiderers and jewelers. Given the valuable items it sells, it is the only souk whose doors are closed and guarded during the night. In the middle, there is a square where the former slave market stood until the middle of the 19th century.

Souk El Berka leads to Souk El Leffa, a souk that sells many carpets, blankets, and other weavings, and extends with the Souk Es Sarragine, built in the early 18th century and specializing in leather. At the periphery are the souks Et Trouk, El Blat, El Blaghgia, El Kébabgia, En Nhas (copper), Es Sabbaghine (dyeing) and El Grana that sell clothing and blankets and was occupied by Jewish merchants.

====Walls and gates====
From the early days of its founding, Tunis has been considered an important military base. The Arab geographer El Yacoubi has written that in the 9th century Tunis was surrounded by a wall of brick and clay except for the side of the sea where it was stone. Bab El-Jazeera, perhaps the oldest gate of the south wall, opened onto the southern road. Bab Cartagena gave access to Carthage, important for bringing in construction materials needed for the city. Bab Souika (initially known as Bab El Saqqayin) had a strategic role to keep the roads to Bizerte, Béja and Le Kef. Bab Menara (initially known as Bab El Artha) opened onto the medina and onto the suburb of El Haoua. As for El Bab Bhar, it allowed access to some funduqs where Christian merchants lived in Tunis.

With the development of the capital under the reign of the Hafsids, two emerging suburbs grew outside the walls; Bab El Jazira in the south and Bab Souika to the north. In the early 14th century, Hafsid Darba Abû al-Muhammad al-Mustansir Lihyânî ordered the construction of a second chamber including the Medina and two suburbs outside. Six new gates were built including Bab El Khadra, Bab Saadoun, Bab El Allouj (initially called Bab Er-Rehiba), Khalid or Bab Bab Sidi Abdallah Cherif, Bab El Fellah and Bab Alioua. In the Ottoman period, four new gates were established: Bab Laassal, Bab Sidi Abdesselam, Bab El Bab Gorjani, and Sidi Kacem. The city retains some of these gates including Bab El Khadra, Bab El Bhar, and Bab Jedid but some of the earlier ones have long disappeared.

=== Places of worship ===

Among the places of worship, they are predominantly Muslim mosques. There are also Christian churches and temples : Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Tunis (Catholic Church), Protestant churches, Evangelical Churches.

As in the rest of Tunisia, a very large majority of the population of Tunis (around 99%) is Sunni Muslim. The capital is home to a large number of mosques in various architectural styles, signs of construction of their respective eras. 
The main and oldest of them is the Al-Zaytuna Mosque, founded in 689 and built in 732 and is in the heart of the Medina. Practicing the Maliki rite as the vast majority of Tunisia&#x27;s Mosques. It was completely rebuilt in 864 and is a prestigious place of worship, and was long an important place of culture and knowledge with the University of Ez-Zitouna on the premises until the independence of Tunisia. It still hosts the main ceremonies marking the dates on the Muslim calendar and is regularly attended by the president.
The medina contains most of the major mosques in the capital which were built before the advent of the French protectorate. The mosque in the Kasbah, was founded in 1230. Practicing the Hanafi rite since 1584, it is recognisable mainly by the dome as well as its minaret, similar to the Koutoubia in Marrakesh and is the highest in the city. Ksar Mosque, also of the Hanafi rite, is located in front of Dar Hussein (Bab Menara) and was built in the 12th century. The Hammouda Pasha Mosque, built in 1655, is the second mosque built by the Hanafi rite in Tunis. Youssef Dey Mosque operated primarily as a public speaking venue before becoming a real mosque in 1631. The Sidi Mahrez Mosque is the largest mosque Hanafi mosque in terms of area but not the tallest. Built in 1692, it resembles the Ottoman Süleymaniye Mosque in Istanbul. The Saheb Ettabaâ Mosque, built between 1808 and 1814 was the last mosque built by the Tunis Husseinites before the French occupation.
The presence of modern churches in Tunis is also testimony to the French presence for half a century. Tunis is the seat of the Diocese of Tunis, with the seat located at the Cathedral of St Vincent de Paul, The church was built in 1897 on the site of the old Christian cemetery of Saint-Antoine. This includes a network of Catholic buildings, including the Church of St. Joan of Arc, but also with the Protestant Reformed Church and the Anglican church Saint-Georges.

Greeks used to enjoy an important presence in the city since ancient times. Tunis is the headquarters of the Greek Orthodox Holy Archdiocese of Carthage with jurisdiction over Algeria, Mauritania, Morocco, and Tunisia. It belongs to the Patriarchate of Alexandria and All Africa, and its cathedral, small school, and other buildings are in Central Tunis.
In total, there are three Greek Orthodox and two Russian Orthodox parishes in Tunisia. The Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria also maintains jurisdiction in Tunisia.
The small Orthodox community is centred around the Greek Orthodox Church (1862), managed by the Greek Embassy and the Russian Orthodox Church (1957), reflecting the presence in Tunisia of a small colony of Russian immigrants.

Judaism, meanwhile, enjoys a long tradition of presence in the city despite the emigration of a large part of the community after independence. Among the places of worship are Beit Yaacouv Synagogue and especially the Great Synagogue of Tunis, built at the end of the 1940s to replace the former Great Synagogue which was demolished as part of the Jewish redevelopment area, the Hara.

===Parks and greenery===
Tunis has some large parks, many of which were installed at the end of the 19th century by the authorities of the French protectorate. The largest Park, Belvédère Park, which was founded in 1892, overlooks Lake Tunis. It is the oldest public park in the country and is built in the landscape style common to France. The park covers an area of more than one hundred hectares across roads that can be explored on foot or by car. It is also home to Tunis Zoo, which houses African fauna, and the Museum of Modern Art.

Habib Thameur garden in Tunis has a central pond and flower beds. The Gorjani garden is an English garden located southwest of the city, which notably takes an irregular form, partly due to the steep topography of the land.

==Culture==

===Museums===

Located in an old beylical palace (the palace of the Bey of Tunis since the end of the 18th century), the Bardo National Museum is the most important archaeological museum in the Maghreb, and has one of the richest Roman mosaic collections in the world. Its collections developed rapidly because of numerous archaeological discoveries in the surrounding territory.

In 1964, the Dar Ben Abdallah, a palace probably dating back to the 18th century, became the seat of the capital&#x27;s Museum of Arts and Popular Traditions. In its exposition halls, it holds numerous traditional items, witnesses of the everyday lives of families of the Medina quarter.

The Museum of the National Movement is situated in Dar Maâkal Az-Zaïm, which was the residence of nationalist Habib Bourguiba for the entirety of the fight for independence. After the advent of independence, a museum was built there to relate the details of the national struggle between 1938 and 1952.

The National Military Museum, opened in 1989 in the suburbs west of the city, holds a collection of 23,000 weapons, 13,000 of which date back to the 19th century, and some of which were used by the Tunisian troops during the Crimean War.

=== Music ===
Tunis holds some of the most prestigious musical institutions in the country. The Rachidia was founded in 1934 to safeguard Arab music, and in particular to promote Tunisian and malouf music. The group is made up of 22 members, both instrumental players and choral musicians.

The Musical Troupe of the City of Tunis was created in 1954 by Salah El Mahdi. In 1955 he placed his student Mohamed Saâda in charge of the ensemble, which at that time included the best artists, and later merged with the ensemble of Radio Tunis. This group contributed to the rise to stardom of numerous Tunisian singers, including Oulaya.

The Association of Arab Orchestra of the City of Tunis began its activities at the end of April 1982, as a workshop linked to the cultural center of the city. It worked on promoting Arab music, on music education and training, and on cooperation with various partners both in Tunisia and abroad. The Tunisian Symphony Orchestra, created in 1969 by the Minister of Culture, has also produced monthly concerts at the Municipal Theater and in various cultural spaces in the city.

===Performing arts===

Tunis is a center of Tunisian culture. The Théâtre municipal de Tunis, opened on 20 November 1902, showcases opera, ballet, symphonic concerts, drama, etc. On the stage of this theater, many performances are regularly given by Tunisian, Arabic, and international actors. The National Theatre of Tunisia is an important public enterprise in Tunis, and since 1988 been located in the Khaznadar palace (dating from the middle of the 19th century and situated in the Halfaouine quarter), renamed &quot;Theater Palace.&quot; In 1993, it also took possession of the former movie theater Le Paris, with a 350-person seating capacity. During each &quot;cultural season&quot; (from October 1 to 30 June) the theater holds over 80 events. The Al Hamra theater was the second theater to be opened in Tunis, situated on El Jazira Road. Al Hamra was one of the most famous theaters in the capital during the 1930s and 1940s. After being closed for fifteen years, it was turned into a small theater in 1986, and since 2001 has housed the first Arab-African center for theater training and research. One should also note the El Teatro and Étoile du Nord theater groups.
Other arts are also represented in the capital. The National Center of the Arts established the puppet theatre in 1976. The National School of Circus Arts was founded following a meeting between the Director of the National Theater and the Director General of the National Center for Arts of Châlons-en-Champagne (France) in 1998. In addition, various small theatres and cultural centers are scattered throughout the city and display various artistic performances.

===Film===
Film producers and cinema have long been present in the city of Tunis. The first animated film was shown in Tunis by the Lumiere brothers as early as 1896. The first screenings were held the following year and the first cinema, the Omnia Pathé, opened in October 1908. The first film club opened in Tunis in 1946 and the Globe, in 1965. The Carthage Film Festival is the oldest established film festival in Africa, running biennially until 2014 and annually thereafter.

In 1990, Ferid Boughedir shot the notable film &quot;Halfaouine Child of the Terraces&quot; in Halfaouine district. The films &quot;The English Patient&quot; (1996) and &quot;The Last Days of Pompeii&quot; (2003) were also shot in studios in Tunis.

===Festivals===
The city holds several festivals each year, of which the largest is the International Festival of Carthage which takes place in July and August. Founded in 1964, much of the festival is held in Carthage in an old amphitheater with a capacity of 7,500 seats. It hosts the performances of singers, musicians, actors, dancers, and films on display on outdoor screens.

==Education==

Tunis and its suburbs have many of the major Tunisian universities including the University of Tunis, Tunisia Private University, University of Ez-Zitouna, the University of Tunis – El Manar, the University of Carthage and the Manouba University. It therefore has the highest concentration of students in Tunisia, with a student population of 75,597 .
There are also a number of other post-secondary institutions, such as the National School of Engineers of Tunis, the National School of Science, the Graduate School of Communications of Tunis, and the Higher Institute of Technological Studies in Communications of Tunis. In addition, private training institutes include the Open University of Tunis, the Central University Private Business Administration and Technology, the Graduate School of Private Engineering and Technology, and the North African Institute of Economics and Technology.

Among the high schools in the capital, the best-known are the Lycée de la Rue du Pacha (founded 1900), Lycée Bab El Khadhra, Lycée de la Rue de Russie, Lycée Bourguiba (formerly Lycée Carnot de Tunis), and the Lycée Alaoui. Until independence, Sadiki College (founded 1875) and Khaldounia (founded 1896) were also among the most recognized. A legacy of the French presence in the country remains, and the city retains many French schools, the most important being the Lycée Pierre Mendes-France at Mutuelleville.

Students can pursue language studies at small private schools such as Sidi Bou Said Centre for Languages (Centre Sidi Bou Said de Langues et d&#x27;Informatique) in the picturesque Tunis suburb of Sidi Bou Said, next to the Sidi Bou Said TGM station that specializes in Arabic, offering classes in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), classical Arabic, Tunisian Arabic and the various dialects of North Africa, the Gulf and the Levant.

===Libraries===

Tunis has some of the most important libraries in Tunisia including the National Library of Tunisia which was first installed in 1924 in the Medina, in a building built in 1810 by Hammouda Bey to serve as barracks for troops and then a jail. The library moved to its current location on Boulevard 9 April in 1938. The new building contains a reading room, conference room, laboratories, an exhibition gallery, a block of technical and administrative services, a restaurant, parking, and green space areas.

Housed in a former home of a Hafsid scholar, the library of the Khaldounia was founded in 1896 along with the creation of the educational institution. After independence and following the consolidation of programs of education, the association ceased operations but the library is now linked to the National Library, which provides for its management.

Built in the 17th century, the Dar Ben Achour also contains a library. Acquired in the late 1970s by the municipality of Tunis, the house was restored in 1983 into a library.

==In the arts==
An engraving of a painting by Charles Bentley entitled was published in Fisher&#x27;s Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1838 with a poetical illustration by Letitia Elizabeth Landon that comments on the potential the city has for development.

==Transport==

=== Public transport ===

The growing metropolitan area is served by an extensive network of public transportation including buses, an above-ground light rail system (le Metro), as well a regional train line (the TGM) that links the city center to its closest northern suburbs. Multi-lane autoroutes surround the city and serve the increasing number of privately owned cars one encounters in Tunisia.

The Tunis area is served by the métro léger (Ar.: المترو الخفيف لمدينة تونس) and TGM (Tunis-Goulette-Marsa), as well as bus services, and is linked to other places in Tunisia by SNCFT, the national railways. The important transport authorities are the Société des Transports de Tunis (STT) and the Ministry of Transport (Airports)

The city has, as of the beginning of the 21st century, a public transportation system developed under the management of the Société des transports de Tunis (STT). In addition to some 200 bus routes, the first light rail line opened in 1985. The Métro léger de Tunis network has extended gradually since then to reach the suburbs. The capital is also linked to its northern suburbs by the railway line that crosses the lake, dividing the lake into two.
New mass transit was planned for Greater Tunis in 2009. This was the RTS (rapid rail network), the local equivalent of the Paris RER, which was to carry tens of thousands of travellers from the distant suburbs of Tunis to the centre by using either existing tracks or new tracks yet to be built.
The plan was for lines based on certain criteria such as population density and the lack of coverage for a given area. Among the priority lines were: Tunis-Borj Cédria (23 km) where modernization and electrification are already planned; Tunis-Mohamedia-Fouchana (19.4 km); Tunis-Manouba-Mnihla (19.2 km); Tunis-Ezzouhour-Sidi Hassine Séjoumi (13.9 km). In addition, the TGM will be integrated into the light-rail network and a new line built around Ayn Zaghouan and Bhar Lazrag (8.4 km). Such an operation would require the upgrading of the docks&#x27; TGM stations so that they become suitable for light rail trains. Among other projects are a line to the city of Ennasr (8.4 km) and the extension of the Tunis-Ettadhamen to Mnihla (1.7 km). For its part, the south light-rail line was extended in November 2008 to El Mourouj with a length of . The total length of the network will eventually be in the range of .

===Infrastructure===

Tunis is served by Tunis-Carthage International Airport, located northeast of downtown, which began operating in 1940 under the name of Tunis El Aouina.

After independence, in the 1960s, the National Board of Seaports, which supports all ports in the country, modernized the infrastructure of the port of Tunis. In the 21st Century, the port of Tunis underwent further transformation with a marina as part of the redevelopment district of La Petite Sicile.
Tunis is the starting point from which the main roads and all highways that serve different parts of the country of Tunis originate. This city has a high density of traffic because vehicle ownership is rising at 7.5% per year. The capital is home to approximately 40% of the cars in Tunisia, with 700,000 cars on average used in the city per day. In this context, major road infrastructure (bridges, interchanges, roads, etc..) was initiated in the late 1990s to decongest the main areas of the capital. The main roads to other Tunisian cities include: Autoroute A1, Tunis-Sfax; Autoroute A3, Tunis-Oued Zarga; and Autoroute A4, Tunis-Bizerte. Also, as part of the major infrastructure project, the city&#x27;s traffic lights were increased from 5,000 to 7,500.

==Sport==

At the beginning of the 20th century, a number of sports institutions were established in Tunis, particularly in school and college settings. In 1905 the Muslim Association of Tunisia brought together students from Lycée Alaoui and Sadiki College to organize gymnastics. A regional gymnastics competition was held in Tunis in 1912 with the participation of thousands of French gymnasts.

Football made its appearance in the capital on 15 September 1904, followed by the formal creation of the country&#x27;s first league, the Racing Club Tunis, on 11 May 1905. It took some time to run properly, but it soon organized meetings between the teams in schools. The first took place on 9 June 1907, between teams from Lycée Alaoui and Lycée Carnot (1–1).

Football is not the only discipline to emerge. Between 1928 and 1955 the city hosted nine rounds of the Grand Prix of Tunis, where notable drivers such as Marcel Lehoux, Achille Varzi, Tazio Nuvolari and Rudolf Caracciola took part. The Grand Prix of Tunis has re-emerged since 2000. The city has also held the Mediterranean Games twice, in 1967 and 2001, and the international tennis tournament, the Tunis Open, which is included in the ATP Challenger Series. The 2005 World Championship final for men in team handball was played in Tunis.

In total, the governorate of Tunis registered 24,095 licenses for various clubs in the municipal area in 2007. Regarding international basketball, the city hosted the FIBA Africa Championship 1965 and the FIBA Africa Championship 1987.

The Esperance Sportive de Tunis (EST), Club Africain (CA), and Stade Tunisien are the major sports clubs in the city. A symbolic class difference is present between the EST&#x27;s and the CA&#x27;s supporters, despite their playing at the same stadium. The EST is supported by the majority of the masses, while the CA, a poorer club, is supported by the others.

The first true sports facilities were managed under the French protectorate, as illustrated by the development of the Ksar Said racecourse and construction of the Stade Chedli Zouiten in the neighborhood of Belvedere, which had long been the main stadium in the capital before being supplanted by the Olympic stadium, Stade El Menzah, where EST and CA play their football today. The Olympic stadium and village area were built to accommodate the Mediterranean Games in 1967. A 60,000-seat stadium was also built in Radès for the Mediterranean Games in 2001 at an estimated cost of 170 million dinars, with nearly half of the loans financed by South Korean businessmen. The Olympic Village was financed by an investment estimated at 50 million dinars. In 2008, the government announced the start of construction of a large sports complex that will include several sports academies, a 20,000-seat stadium, and a swimming centre. Known as Tunis Sports City, it will expand around the lake of Tunis, on the road to La Marsa.

<doc id="57664" wikidata="Q23800" url="?curid=57664" title="Valletta">
<text>Valletta ( ; , ) is the capital city of Malta and one of its 68 council areas. Located between the Grand Harbour to the east and Marsamxett Harbour to the west, its population as of 2021 was 5,157. As Malta’s capital city, it is a commercial centre for shopping, bars, dining, and café life. It is also the southernmost capital of Europe, and at just , it is the European Union&#x27;s smallest capital city.

Valletta&#x27;s 16th-century buildings were constructed by the Knights Hospitaller. The city was named after the Frenchman Jean Parisot de Valette, who succeeded in defending the island against an Ottoman invasion during the Great Siege of Malta. The city is Baroque in character, with elements of Mannerist, Neo-Classical and Modern architecture, though the Second World War left major scars on the city, particularly the destruction of the Royal Opera House. The city was officially recognised as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1980. The city has 320 monuments, all within an area of 0.55 square kilometres (0.21 sq mi), making it one of the most concentrated historic areas in the world. Sometimes called an &quot;open-air museum&quot;, Valletta was chosen as the European Capital of Culture in 2018. Valletta was also listed as the sunniest city in Europe in 2016.

The city is noted for its fortifications, consisting of bastions, curtains and cavaliers, along with the beauty of its Baroque palaces, gardens and churches.

==History==
The peninsula was previously called &quot;Xagħret Mewwija&quot; (Mu&#x27; awiya – Meuia; named during the Arab period) or Ħal Newwija. Mewwija refers to a sheltered place. Some authors state that the extreme end of the peninsula was known as Xebb ir-Ras (Sheb point), of which name origins from the lighthouse on site. A family which surely owned land became known as &quot;Sceberras&quot;, now a Maltese surname as Sciberras. At one point the entire peninsula became known as Sceberras.

Recent scholarly studies have however shown that the Xeberras phrase is of Punic origin and means &#x27;the headland&#x27; and &#x27;the middle peninsula&#x27; as it actually is.

===Order of Saint John===

The building of a city on the Sciberras Peninsula had been proposed by the Order of Saint John as early as 1524. Back then, the only building on the peninsula was a small watchtower dedicated to Erasmus of Formia (Saint Elmo), which had been built in 1488.

In 1552, the Aragonite watchtower was demolished and the larger Fort Saint Elmo was built in its place.

In the Great Siege of 1565, Fort Saint Elmo fell to the Ottomans, but the Order eventually won the siege with the help of Sicilian reinforcements. The victorious Grand Master, Jean de Valette, immediately set out to build a new fortified city on the Sciberras Peninsula to fortify the Order&#x27;s position in Malta and bind the Knights to the island. The city took his name and was called &quot;La Valletta&quot;.

The Grand Master asked the European kings and princes for help, receiving a lot of assistance due to the increased fame of the Order after their victory in the Great Siege. Pope Pius V sent his military architect, Francesco Laparelli, to design the new city, while Philip II of Spain sent substantial monetary aid. The foundation stone of the city was laid by Grand Master de Valette on 28 March 1566. He placed the first stone in what later became Our Lady of Victories Church.

In his book &quot;Dell&#x27;Istoria della Sacra Religione et Illustrissima Militia di San Giovanni Gierosolimitano&quot; (), written between 1594 and 1602, Giacomo Bosio writes that when the cornerstone of Valletta was placed, a group of Maltese elders said: &quot;&quot;Iegi zimen en fel wardia col sceber raba iesue uquie&quot; (Which in modern Maltese reads, &quot;Jiġi żmien li fil-Wardija [l-Għolja Sciberras] kull xiber raba&#x27; jiswa uqija&quot;&quot;, and in English, &quot;There will come a time when every piece of land on Sciberras Hill will be worth its weight in gold&quot;).

De Valette died from a stroke on 21 August 1568 at age 74 and never saw the completion of his city. Originally interred in the church of Our Lady of the Victories, his remains now rest in St. John&#x27;s Co-Cathedral among the tombs of other Grand Masters of the Knights of Malta.

Francesco Laparelli was the city&#x27;s principal designer and his plan departed from medieval Maltese architecture, which exhibited irregular winding streets and alleys. He designed the new city on a rectangular grid plan, and without any &quot;collacchio&quot; (an area restricted for important buildings). The streets were designed to be wide and straight, beginning centrally from the City Gate and ending at Fort Saint Elmo (which was rebuilt) overlooking the Mediterranean; certain bastions were built high. His assistant was the Maltese architect Girolamo Cassar, who later oversaw the construction of the city himself after Laparelli&#x27;s death in 1570.

The &quot;Ufficio delle Case&quot; regulated the building of the city as a planning authority.

The city of Valletta was mostly completed by the early 1570s, and it became the capital on 18 March 1571 when Grand Master Pierre de Monte moved from his seat at Fort St Angelo in Birgu to the Grandmaster&#x27;s Palace in Valletta.

Seven Auberges were built for the Order&#x27;s Langues, and these were complete by the 1580s. An eighth Auberge, Auberge de Bavière, was later added in the 18th century.

In Antoine de Paule&#x27;s reign, it was decided to build more fortifications to protect Valletta, and these were named the Floriana Lines after the architect who designed them, Pietro Paolo Floriani of Macerata. During António Manoel de Vilhena&#x27;s reign, a town began to form between the walls of Valletta and the Floriana Lines, and this evolved from a suburb of Valletta to Floriana, a town in its own right.

In 1634, a gunpowder factory explosion killed 22 people in Valletta. In 1749, Muslim slaves plotted to kill Grandmaster Pinto and take over Valletta, but the revolt was suppressed before it even started due to their plans leaking out to the Order. Later on in his reign, Pinto embellished the city with Baroque architecture, and many important buildings such as Auberge de Castille were remodeled or completely rebuilt in the new architectural style.

In 1775, during the reign of Ximenes, an unsuccessful revolt known as the Rising of the Priests occurred in which Fort Saint Elmo and Saint James Cavalier were captured by rebels, but the revolt was eventually suppressed.

===French occupation and British rule===
In 1798, the French invaded the island and expelled the Order. After the Maltese rebelled, French troops continued to occupy Valletta and the surrounding harbour area, until they capitulated to the British in September 1800. In the early 19th century, the British Civil Commissioner, Henry Pigot, agreed to demolish the majority of the city&#x27;s fortifications. The demolition was again proposed in the 1870s and 1880s, but it was never carried out and the fortifications have survived largely intact.

Eventually building projects in Valletta resumed under British rule. These projects included widening gates, demolishing and rebuilding structures, widening newer houses over the years, and installing civic projects. The Malta Railway, which linked Valletta to Mdina, was officially opened in 1883. It was closed down in 1931 after buses became a popular means of transport.

In 1939, Valletta was abandoned as the headquarters of the Royal Navy Mediterranean Fleet due to its proximity to Italy and the city became a flash point during the subsequent two-year long Siege of Malta. German and Italian air raids throughout the Second World War caused much destruction in Valletta and the rest of the harbor area. The Royal Opera House, constructed at the city entrance in the 19th century, was one of the buildings lost to the raids.

===Contemporary===
In 1980, the 24th Chess Olympiad took place in Valletta.

The entire city of Valletta has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1980, along with Megalithic Temples of Malta and the Hypogeum of Ħal-Saflieni. On 11 November 2015, Valletta hosted the Valletta Summit on Migration in which European and African leaders discussed the European migrant crisis. After that, on 27 November 2015, the city also hosted part of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2015.

Valletta was the European Capital of Culture in 2018.

==Government==


===Local government===
The Valletta Local Council was established by the Local Councils Act of 1993, along with the other local councils of Malta. The first election was held on 20 November 1993. Other elections were held in 1996, 1999, 2002, 2005, 2008, 2013, 2017.
The present local council was elected in 2019.
The local council is housed in a building in South Street. 

The following people have served as Mayors of Valletta:
*Hector Bruno (1993–1999) (PN)
*Paul Borg Olivier (1999–2008) (PN)
*Alexei Dingli (2008–2019) (PN) 
*Christian Micallef (2019) (PN) 
*Alfred Zammit (2019–) (PL) 

===National government===
Valletta is the capital city of Malta, and is the country&#x27;s administrative and commercial hub. The Parliament of Malta has been housed at the Parliament House near the city&#x27;s entrance since 2015: it was previously housed at the Grandmaster&#x27;s Palace in the city centre. The latter palace still houses the Office of the President of Malta, while the Auberge de Castille houses the Office of the Prime Minister of Malta. The courthouse and many government departments are also located in Valletta.

==Geography==

The Valletta peninsula has two natural harbours, Marsamxett and the Grand Harbour. The Grand Harbour is Malta&#x27;s major port, with unloading quays at nearby Marsa. A cruise-liner terminal is located along the old seawall of the Valletta Waterfront that Portuguese Grandmaster Manuel Pinto da Fonseca built.

===Climate===

Valletta features a Mediterranean climate (Köppen &quot;Csa&quot;) with very mild, wet winters and warm to hot, slightly long, dry summers, with an average annual temperature above during the day and . Valletta experiences a lack of precipitation during the summer months and most of the precipitation happens during the winter months. Winter temperatures are moderated by the surrounding sea, as a result, the city has very mild winters and a long seasonal lag. The official climate recording station in Malta is at Luqa Airport, which is a few miles inland from Valletta. Average high temperatures range from around in January to about in August, while average low temperatures range from around in January to in August.

==Cityscape==

The architecture of Valletta&#x27;s streets and piazzas ranges from mid-16th century Baroque to Modernism. The city is the island&#x27;s principal cultural center and has a unique collection of churches, palaces and museums and act as one of the city&#x27;s main visitor attractions. When Benjamin Disraeli, future British Prime Minister, visited the city in 1830, he described it as &quot;a city of palaces built by gentlemen for gentlemen,&quot; and remarked that &quot;Valletta equals in its noble architecture, if it does not excel, any capital in Europe,&quot; and in other letters called it &quot;comparable to Venice and Cádiz&quot; and &quot;full of palaces worthy of Palladio.&quot;

Buildings of historic importance include St John&#x27;s Co-Cathedral, formerly the Conventual Church of the Knights of Malta. It has the only signed work and largest painting by Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio. The Auberge de Castille et Leon, formerly the official seat of the Knights of Malta of the Langue of Castille, Léon and Portugal, is now the office of the Prime Minister of Malta. The Grandmaster&#x27;s Palace, built between 1571 and 1574 and formerly the seat of the Grand Master of the Knights of Malta, used to house the Maltese Parliament, now situated in a purpose-built structure at the entrance to the city, and now houses the offices of the President of Malta.

Admiralty House is a Baroque palace dating to the late 1570s. It was the official residence of the Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet during the British era from the 1820s onwards. From 1974 until 2016, it was the site of the National Museum of Fine Arts.

The Manoel Theatre () was constructed in just ten months in 1731, by order of Grand Master António Manoel de Vilhena, and is one of the oldest working theatres in Europe. The Mediterranean Conference Centre was formerly the Sacra Infermeria. Built in 1574, it was one of Europe&#x27;s most renowned hospitals during the Renaissance. The fortifications of the port, built by the Knights as a magnificent series of bastions, demi-bastions, cavaliers and curtains, approximately high, all contribute to the unique architectural quality of the city.

===Neighbourhoods===
Valletta contains a number of unofficial neighbourhoods, including:

*Strada Rjali – the main thoroughfare, Triq ir-Repubblika
*l-Arċipierku – an area close to the Sacra Infermeria. Its name possibly derives from &quot;archipelago&quot; since it contains a number of lanes which break up the area into many &quot;islands&quot; of houses, or from &quot;archi-borgo&quot; since the area is located just outside Fort Saint Elmo.
*il-Baviera – an area around the English Curtain, bounded by Old Bakery, Archbishop, Marsamxett and St. Sebastian Streets. It is named after Auberge de Bavière.
*il-Biċċerija – an area close to il-Baviera, named after the slaughterhouse which was formerly located there.
*il-Kamrata – an area close to the Sacra Infermeria. It is named after the Camerata, a spiritual retreat which was demolished in the 19th century and replaced by social housing.
*Deux Balles () – an area close to il-Baviera. The name probably originates from the French occupation.
*il-Fossa – an area close to the Jews&#x27; Sally Port and Fort Saint Elmo. It is regarded as the worst maintained area of Valletta.
*Manderaggio () – an area behind Manderaggio Curtain, bounded by St. Mark, St. Lucia, St. Patrick and Marsamxett Streets. This was meant to be a small harbour (mandracchio) but it was never completed, and a slum area developed instead. The slums were demolished in the 1950s and were rebuilt as housing estates.

==Economy==
Eurostat estimates the labour force in 2015 for the greater Valletta area at around 91,000 people. This corresponds to a share of just under 50 percent of Malta. As in Malta as a whole, tourism is an important economic sector. The most important tourist zone is the area surrounding the Grand Harbour. For the cruise industry, after several years of planning, work began in 2002 to build the Valletta Waterfront Project, a cruise terminal, in the Grand Harbour. There is also a publishing house in Valletta, Allied Newspapers Ltd., a media company. This company publishes the two market-leading newspapers, &quot;Times of Malta&quot; and &quot;The Sunday Times of Malta&quot;.

==Education==
The Valletta Campus of the University of Malta is situated in the Old University Building. It serves as an extension of the Msida Campus, especially offering international masters programmes.

A church school, &quot;St. Albert the Great&quot;, is also situated in Valletta. The Headmaster is Alternattiva Demokratika politician Mario Mallia.

==Culture==

Valletta was designated European Capital of Culture for 2018. The year was inaugurated with an event called Erba&#x27; Pjazez (Four Squares), with shows focused in 4 plazas in the city – Triton Square, St. George&#x27;s Square, St. John&#x27;s Square, and Castille Square – along with other shows in other points. This was followed by the unveiling of a public art installation, Kif Jgħid il-Malti (Maltese Sayings), which featured a number of Maltese language proverb figured in gypsum, in order to engage linguistic heritage.

===Saint James Cavalier===
Saint James Cavalier, originally a raised gun platform, was converted into a Centre of Creativity in the year 2000 as part of Malta&#x27;s Millennium Project. It now houses a small theatre, a cinema, music rooms and art galleries. Various exhibitions are regularly held there. It has welcomed over a million visitors since opening.

===Music===
The Valletta International Baroque Festival is held every year in January. Jazz music in Malta was introduced in the Strait Street area, frequented by Allied sailors during both World Wars. Malta&#x27;s Jazz Festival took place here. Strait Street is also known as &quot;The Gut&quot;. This area is undergoing a programme of regeneration. The city&#x27;s dual band clubs are the &quot;King&#x27;s Own Band Club&quot; () and &quot;La Valette National Philharmonic Society&quot; ().

===Carnival===
Valletta is the scene of the Maltese Carnival, held in February each year, leading up to Lent. There were no carnival trucks in 2020 or 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, but trucks returned in 2022.

In 1823 the Valletta carnival was the scene of a human crush tragedy in which at least 110 boys perished.

===Feasts===
* The feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel is celebrated on 16 July
* Saint Paul&#x27;s feast is celebrated on 10 February
* Saint Dominic&#x27;s feast is celebrated in Valletta on 4 August or before
* The feast of Saint Augustine is celebrated on the third Sunday after Easter
* The city&#x27;s residents also conduct an annual procession in honour of St. Rita

===In literature and the arts===
* The poetical illustrations (painted by T. C. Dibden, engraved by J. Tingle) and (painted by Samuel Prout, engraved by J, Carter) by Letitia Elizabeth Landon were both published in &quot;Fisher&#x27;s Drawing Room Scrap Book&quot;, 1837. A further poem illustrates a painting of the procession in the Strada St Giovanni painted by Samuel Prout and engraved by E. Challis is in &quot;Fisher&#x27;s Drawing Room Scrap Book&quot;, 1838.

==Twin towns – sister cities==
Valletta is twinned with:
* Palermo, Italy
* Pisa, Italy
* Cortona, Italy, since August 26, 2022
* Rhodes, Greece
* Byblos, Lebanon
* Piran, Slovenia

==Transport==

Malta International Airport is from the city in the town of Luqa. Malta&#x27;s public transport system, which uses buses, operates mostly on routes to or from Valletta, with their central terminus just outside the city gate. Traffic within the city itself is restricted, with some principal roads being completely pedestrian areas. In 2006, a park and ride system was implemented in order to increase the availability of parking spaces in the city. People can leave their vehicles in a nearby Floriana car park and transfer to a van for the rest of the trip.

In 2007, a congestion pricing scheme was implemented to reduce long-term parking and traffic while promoting business in the city. An ANPR-based automated system takes photos of vehicles as they enter and exit the charging zone and vehicle owners are billed according to the duration of their stay.

Valletta is served by a fleet of electric taxis which transport riders from 10 points in Valletta to any destination in the city.

As of 2021, an underground Malta Metro is being planned, with a projected total cost of €6.2 billion, centred on the Valletta urban area.

Virtu Ferries offer passenger and goods services to Pozzallo and Catania, Sicily.

<text>Richard Christopher Wakeman (born 18 May 1949) is an English keyboardist and composer best known as a member of the progressive rock band Yes across five tenures between 1971 and 2004, and for his prolific solo career. AllMusic describes Wakeman as a &quot;classically trained keyboardist extraordinaire who plied his trade with Yes and developed his own brand of live spectacular in a solo act.&quot;

Born and raised in West London, Wakeman quit his studies at the Royal College of Music in 1969 to become a full-time session musician. His early sessions included &quot;Space Oddity&quot;, among other tracks, for David Bowie, and songs by Elton John, Marc Bolan, Cat Stevens, and Lou Reed. In 1970, Wakeman joined the folk rock group the Strawbs, during which his virtuosity gained national press coverage. He left in 1971 to join Yes, with whom he played on some of their most influential albums across two stints until 1980. During this time Wakeman began a solo career in 1973 and became an iconic and prominent figure in progressive rock. His highest-selling and most acclaimed albums are his first three: &quot;The Six Wives of Henry VIII&quot; (1973), the UK number-one &quot;Journey to the Centre of the Earth&quot; (1974), and &quot;The Myths and Legends of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table&quot; (1975), all concept albums. In 1974, he formed his band the English Rock Ensemble, with which he toured worldwide and continues to perform, and went on to score his first major film, &quot;Lisztomania&quot; (1975).

Wakeman had uneven success in the next two decades following a change in musical fashion and financial issues from two divorces. His most popular album was the conceptual rocker &quot;1984&quot; (1981), which was followed by the minor pop hit single &quot;Glory Boys&quot; from &quot;Silent Nights&quot; (1985). He expanded into other areas such as hosting the television show &quot;GasTank&quot;, composing for television and film, forming record labels, and producing his first new-age, ambient, and Christian music with &quot;Country Airs&quot; (1986) and &quot;The Gospels&quot; (1987), respectively. In 1989, he reunited with former Yes bandmates for Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe, which led to his third period in the group until 1992. Wakeman&#x27;s most significant album of the 1990s was &quot;Return to the Centre of the Earth&quot; (1999), his first UK top 40 album in 18 years, and his piano album &quot;Piano Portraits&quot; (2017) produced his first UK top 10 album since 1975. Starting in 2009, Wakeman revisited his three hit albums of the 1970s by performing them live with new and expanded arrangements. From 2016 to 2020, Wakeman was a member of Yes Featuring Jon Anderson, Trevor Rabin, Rick Wakeman. He continues to record albums and perform concerts worldwide in various capacities. His most recent album was &quot;Yessonata&quot;, released October 2024.

Wakeman&#x27;s discography includes over 100 solo albums spanning a range of musical styles. He has also gained notoriety for his appearances on the television programs &quot;Live at Jongleurs&quot;, &quot;Countdown&quot;, &quot;Grumpy Old Men&quot;, and &quot;Watchdog&quot;, and for his radio show on Planet Rock that aired from 2005 to 2010. Wakeman has written an autobiography and two memoirs. In 2017, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Yes. He was awarded a CBE for his services to music and broadcasting in 2021.

==Early life==
Richard Christopher Wakeman was born in Perivale, Middlesex on 18 May 1949. The only child of Cyril and Mildred Wakeman (née Eastment), the three lived in Wood End Gardens in nearby Northolt. Cyril worked at a building suppliers which he joined as an office boy at age fourteen, and worked his way up to become one of its directors. He was a pianist in Ted Heath&#x27;s big band while he was in the British Army. Mildred worked at a removals firm. Wakeman attended Drayton Manor Grammar School in Hanwell, in 1959. The family spent their summer holidays in Exmouth.

As a youngster Wakeman heard his parents, uncle, and aunts play the piano and sing songs from his upstairs bedroom, which made him want to take up the instrument. His father took him to a concert performance of Sergei Prokofiev &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot;, which greatly influenced him and has since named Prokofiev as a musical hero. At seven, Wakeman began weekly piano lessons with Dorothy Symes paid for by his father, who spent almost half of his income on tuition. Lessons with Symes lasted for eleven years; she recalled Wakeman &quot;passed everything with a distinction&quot;, was an &quot;enjoyable pupil to teach, full of fun and with a good sense of humour&quot;, but lacked discipline when it came to practising. Wakeman&#x27;s first ever recital was &quot;See a Monkey on a Stick&quot;, a piece of thirteen notes that he performed on stage in adult life. In 1960, Symes entered Wakeman in his first music competition and he went on to win many awards, certificates, and cups in contests around London. Wakeman&#x27;s first keyboard was a reed organ from Woolworths that he said cost £4. At twelve he took up the clarinet. In his teenage years, he learned to play the church organ, became a Sunday school teacher, and chose to be baptised at eighteen.

Wakeman described himself at school as &quot;a horror ... I worked hard in the first year, then eased up&quot;. In 1961, during his time at Drayton Manor school, Wakeman played in his first band, the trad jazz outfit Brother Wakeman and the Clergymen, with a uniform of the school shirt put on the wrong way round. In 1963, at fourteen, Wakeman joined the Atlantic Blues, a local blues group that secured a year&#x27;s residency at a mental health rehabilitation club in Neasden. Two years later, Wakeman passed his O Levels in English, maths, art and music, and went on to study music, art, and British constitution at A-level. In 1966, he joined the Concordes, later known as the Concorde Quartet, playing dance and pop songs at local events with his cousin Alan Wakeman on saxophone and clarinet. Wakeman used the money earned from their gigs to buy a Hohner Pianet, his first electronic keyboard.

That year he also formed a dance band called the Green Dolphin Trio, spending a year&#x27;s residency at a social club in Alperton, and Curdled Milk, a joke on &quot;Strange Brew&quot; by Cream, to play at the annual school dance. The band were unpaid after Wakeman lost control of his car and drove across the headmaster&#x27;s rose garden at the front of the school, thereby forfeiting their performance fee to pay for the damage. In 1967, Wakeman began a tenure with the Ronnie Smith Band, a dance group based at the Top Rank ballroom in Watford. He was sacked in the following year for not taking the dance music seriously enough, but was soon reinstated at the ballroom in Reading. Here he met singer Ashley Holt, who later sang on many of Wakeman&#x27;s future albums and tours. Around this time, Wakeman frequented the Red Lion pub in Brentford where he took part in jam sessions with several known musicians including John Entwistle, James Royal, Nick Simper, and Mitch Mitchell.
In 1968, Wakeman acquired a scholarship at the Royal College of Music in London with the intention of becoming a concert pianist. To enter he needed to pass eight music exams to earn his A-level in the subject, which required him, as his mother remembered, &quot;to do two years&#x27; work in ten months&quot;. He put in the effort following a ten shilling bet with his music teacher who believed he would not succeed, and refusing his father&#x27;s offer to work with him at the building suppliers. Wakeman entered the college on a performer&#x27;s course with the piano as his first study, clarinet his second, and orchestration and modern music his third, but quickly found out that &quot;everyone else there was at least as good as me; and a lot of them much better&quot;, and switched to a teacher&#x27;s course. His orchestration professor, Philip Cannon, had a long-lasting influence on his compositional skills.

He adopted a more relaxed attitude to his studies, spending much of his time drinking in pubs and hanging out with the staff at the Musical Bargain Centre, a music shop in Ealing. Wakeman&#x27;s first booking as a session musician, and his first time in a recording studio, occurred when guitarist Chas Cronk entered the shop in need of an organist and brass arranger for members of the Ike &amp; Tina Turner Revue. The shop owner suggested Wakeman, who attended the session at Olympic Studios where he met producers Denny Cordell, Gus Dudgeon, and Tony Visconti, and engineer Keith Grant. Cordell was impressed with Wakeman&#x27;s skills and offered him more session work for artists at Regal Zonophone Records. Wakeman accepted the additional income to compensate the small grant he had received to study, and began skipping classes in favour of the more lucrative sessions which was frowned upon at the college. After a year Wakeman dropped out with the encouragement from his clarinet professor Basil Tschaikov.

==Career==
===1969–1971: Session work, the Strawbs, and joining Yes===

Wakeman became a full-time session musician, performing and arranging music for other musicians, films, and television and radio jingles as often as eighteen times in a week. He estimated to have participated in around 2,000 sessions in his career. His ability to produce what was needed in a short time led to his nickname, One Take Wakeman. Among his first sessions were playing on &quot;Battersea Power Station&quot; by Junior&#x27;s Eyes and, in June 1969, the Mellotron on &quot;Space Oddity&quot; by David Bowie for a £9 fee after Dudgeon needed a player, as neither knew much about the instrument. Wakeman went on to play on several tracks on Bowie&#x27;s second album, &quot;David Bowie&quot;, and organ and piano on American singer Tucker Zimmerman&#x27;s only single, &quot;Red Wind&quot;. 

In one session, Visconti had Wakeman play a single bass note on the piano at the end of &quot;Walk on Guilded Splinters&quot; by Marsha Hunt, so he could be paid the session fee. In 1970, Wakeman performed on &quot;Seasons&quot; by Magna Carta, and records by Brotherhood of Man, Paper Bubble, Shawn Phillips, and White Plains. He took part in a one-off recording with Visconti and Marc Bolan that was released as a single under the pseudonym Dib Cochran and the Earwigs. After a short return stint in the Ronnie Smith group, Wakeman spotted an advertisement in the &quot;Melody Maker&quot; for an organist in the Spinning Wheel, a pub band at The Greyhound in Chadwell Heath, for seven nights a week. He got the job and moved there with his first wife. Around this time Simper invited Wakeman to join his new band, Warhorse, but he lacked commitment and had difficulty adapting to their hard rock sound. He left before their first demo was recorded.

Wakeman&#x27;s prominence rose during his tenure with the folk rock group the Strawbs. He had played the piano as a session musician on &quot;Dragonfly&quot; (1970), which was the first album released with Wakeman&#x27;s name on its credits. During his stint in the Spinning Wheel, Strawbs frontman Dave Cousins invited him to join the band in March 1970. The group went to Paris to perform at a rock circus with various bands backing the circus acts. During one show, and unbeknownst to Wakeman, he pushed Salvador Dalí off the stage as he made a special guest appearance during his piano solo: &quot;I didn&#x27;t know who he was. I thought, &#x27;Silly old sod, coming on the stage waving his stick&#x27;.&quot; The Strawbs&#x27; first major concert, on 11 July 1970 at London&#x27;s Queen Elizabeth Hall, was recorded and released as &quot;Just a Collection of Antiques and Curios&quot;, both of which brought Wakeman&#x27;s virtuosity into the national spotlight. &quot;Where is This Dream of Your Youth&quot; features an extended organ solo and &quot;Temperament of Mind&quot;, a solo piano piece that developed from improvisations when the band would lose power, received a standing ovation. Wakeman was featured on the front page of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; for the first time, calling him &quot;tomorrow&#x27;s superstar&quot; and &quot;pop find of 1970&quot;. Also in July 1970, Wakeman launched a folk music night at the White Hart pub in Acton called the Booze Droop. It failed to make an impact and Wakeman owed the landlord money, so Bowie agreed to perform an acoustic set for £5 to help raise funds. The gig had around 12 attendees, as people thought the advertisements for the gig were a joke.

The income that Wakeman earned in sessions and the Strawbs allowed him to buy a home in West Harrow. Despite being paid well, Wakeman soon became disillusioned with session work because he was not involved in the songwriting. He bought a Minimoog synthesiser at half price from actor Jack Wild, who thought that it was defective because it only played one note at a time. Wakeman was involved in several notable sessions in 1971. He arranged and played the piano on &quot;Morning Has Broken&quot; by Cat Stevens, but was omitted from the credits and for many years was not paid. Stevens later apologised and had the record company pay Wakeman for the error, which was donated to one of Stevens&#x27; schools. Wakeman played the Hammond organ on &quot;Madman Across the Water&quot; by Elton John, and was a feature artist on &quot;Orange&quot; by Al Stewart. Bowie invited Wakeman to his home and played the outline of some songs for him on a guitar to learn, which Wakeman later called &quot;the finest selection of songs I have ever heard in one sitting in my entire life&quot;. The result was &quot;Changes&quot;, &quot;Oh! You Pretty Things&quot;, and &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; for Bowie&#x27;s album &quot;Hunky Dory&quot;, which feature Wakeman on piano. He later reflected: &quot;David was incredibly influential to me. I learned more about how to work in a studio from David than anybody. He was tremendous in that respect.&quot; Wakeman played a series of piano glissandos on &quot;Get It On&quot; for T. Rex, after frontman Marc Bolan offered him the session as he was desperate to pay his rent for the week. In late 1971, an album of covers with Wakeman on the piano, the John Schroeder orchestra, and an unknown female vocalist was released as &quot;Piano Vibrations&quot;. His name is omitted from the cover and liner notes, and was paid £36 for the four sessions it took to record it.

The Strawbs&#x27; album &quot;From the Witchwood&quot; (1971) marked the growing differences between Wakeman and the rest of the band as he prioritised session work and contributed little to the music. He struggled to cover his mortgage and bills with money earned from the group, and started to consider other career options. In July 1971, Bowie invited Wakeman to join his new backing band, the Spiders from Mars, on the same day that bassist Chris Squire of the progressive rock group Yes offered him the chance to join the band, after Tony Kaye had been asked to leave following his resistance to learn instruments other than the piano and organ. Wakeman agreed to meet Yes as they rehearsed for their fourth album, &quot;Fragile&quot; (1971), and during his first session with the band, &quot;Heart of the Sunrise&quot; and &quot;Roundabout&quot;, two of the band&#x27;s iconic songs, were put together. Wakeman decided that Yes presented more favourable opportunities and declined Bowie&#x27;s offer; his arrival into the band in August 1971 made the front page news in &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, his second cover feature in a year. With Yes his earnings rose from £18 to £50 to a week.

===1971–1974: First Yes run, &quot;The Six Wives of Henry VIII&quot;, and &quot;Journey to the Centre of the Earth&quot;===
&quot;Fragile&quot; was recorded in five weeks so the band could resume touring and help finance a new set of keyboards for Wakeman. The album features a solo track written by each member; Wakeman&#x27;s track, &quot;Cans and Brahms&quot;, is an adaptation of the third movement of Symphony No. 4 by Johannes Brahms played on electronic keyboards. He called it &quot;dreadful&quot; as contractual disputes between Atlantic Records, who had signed Yes, and A&amp;M prevented him from writing his own composition. Wakeman said he was never credited for his contributions on &quot;Fragile&quot;, including piano sections on &quot;Heart of the Sunrise&quot; and &quot;South Side of the Sky&quot;, despite being told that management would sort the issue. He enjoyed the music too much to cause further rifts. &quot;Fragile&quot; reached the top ten in the UK and the US, and the Fragile Tour marked Wakeman&#x27;s first visit to North America. During the tour he signed a five-album deal with A&amp;M Records as a solo artist. The commercial success of &quot;Fragile&quot; allowed Wakeman to buy a new home in Gerrards Cross and start a car collection, which he rented out through his new business, the Fragile Carriage Company.

In the 1972 &quot;Melody Maker&quot; readers&#x27; poll, Wakeman ranked second in the Top Keyboardist category behind Keith Emerson. That same year, Yes followed &quot;Fragile&quot; with &quot;Close to the Edge&quot;, which is considered a landmark progressive rock album and features Wakeman playing a church organ and harpsichord. He is credited on the final track, &quot;Siberian Khatru&quot;. Wakeman picked the album as &quot;one of the finest moments of Yes&#x27; career.&quot; The Close to the Edge Tour marked the first time Wakeman wore a cape on stage after a fan offered his own for one of the band members to wear. He then had his own made; the first was made of sequins and cost US$300. The concert film &quot;Yessongs&quot;, filmed in 1972 at the Rainbow Theatre, featured his solo spot in the show. Also that month at the venue, Wakeman was a guest musician at the Who&#x27;s orchestral performances of &quot;Tommy&quot;. He also developed music for the 1972 film, &quot;Zee and Co.&quot;

In January 1973, Wakeman released his debut solo album, &quot;The Six Wives of Henry VIII&quot;. It was recorded in 1972 during gaps in touring and recording with Yes, and features members of the band, the Strawbs, and other guest musicians. The album is instrumental with its concept based on Wakeman&#x27;s musical interpretations of the characteristics of the six wives of Henry VIII. The album was previewed with Wakeman performing excerpts on the BBC television show, &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test&quot;. Much of the television audience that night planned to watch &quot;Blue Movie&quot;, a controversial film by Andy Warhol, but it was temporarily banned from being broadcast. Wakeman explained: &quot;It seems most of them, rather than watch repeats, switched over to &quot;Whistle Test&quot; and saw my preview of &quot;Henry&quot; ... and suddenly it seemed as if the whole country had discovered my music ... it was a tremendous break.&quot; The album reached No. 7 in the UK and No. 30 in the US, and &quot;Time&quot; named the record one of the best albums of the year. At the &quot;Melody Maker&quot; readers poll awards in September 1973, Wakeman came out first in the top keyboardist category.
Yes&#x27;s double concept album &quot;Tales from Topographic Oceans&quot; was released in November 1973, containing four side long pieces based on ideas from Hindu scriptures in &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot; by Paramahansa Yogananda. Wakeman had doubts about its esoteric concept, and felt a lot of its music was too experimental which required further rehearsal. He distanced himself from the group, and spent time in the bar at Morgan Studios and played on &quot;Sabbra Caddabra&quot; on &quot;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath&quot; by Black Sabbath in the adjacent studio. Yes toured the album for six months, playing the album in its entirety which Wakeman also disagreed with. He openly criticised the album to the press, and his growing frustrations culminated in an incident whereby he ate a curry on stage during a show in Manchester. In 2006, Wakeman clarified that his total dislike of the album is &quot;not entirely true&quot; and recognises some &quot;very, very nice musical moments&quot;, but &quot;we had too much for a single album but not enough for a double, so we padded it out and the padding is awful&quot;.

During the &quot;Topographic Oceans&quot; tour Wakeman recorded his new 40-minute work &quot;Journey to the Centre of the Earth&quot;, based on Jules Verne&#x27;s same-titled science-fiction novel. He came up with the idea in 1971, but shelved the project until &quot;The Six Wives of Henry VIII&quot; was complete. After working on the music with Lou Reizner, David Measham, Wil Malone, and Danny Beckerman, which features an orchestra, choir, and a rock band, Wakeman chose to record the piece in concert due to the high costs of a studio. To help finance the project, he sold some of his cars and &quot;mortgage[d himself] up to the hilt&quot;, all of which cost around £40,000. Two concerts were held at London&#x27;s Royal Festival Hall on 18 January 1974 with the London Symphony Orchestra, the English Chamber Choir, actor David Hemmings as narrator, and a five-piece band formed of musicians that Wakeman played with in a west London pub: vocalists Ashley Holt and Gary Pickford-Hopkins, drummer Barney James, bassist Roger Newell, and guitarist Mike Egan. A&amp;M wanted to use better known musicians, but Wakeman wanted the album to be known for its music rather than the performers. After cutting the album A&amp;M refused to sell it, but as Wakeman was under contract with its US division, a cassette was sent to co-founder Jerry Moss who liked it and ordered its worldwide release.

After touring &quot;Topographic Oceans&quot;, Wakeman retreated to his Devonshire home. He heard early ideas for Yes&#x27;s next album, felt he could no longer contribute to the style of music they were making, and confirmed his departure from the band on his twenty-fifth birthday. Later that day, A&amp;M informed him that &quot;Journey&quot; had entered the UK charts at No. 1, a first for the label. &quot;Journey&quot; also reached No. 3 in the US, and earned Wakeman a Grammy and Ivor Novello Award nomination. The album has sold an estimated 14 million copies worldwide. On 27 July 1974, Wakeman headlined the Crystal Palace Garden Party concert, performing selections from &quot;Six Wives&quot; and &quot;Journey&quot; in its entirety. By this time, his excessive smoking and alcohol consumption, a lack of sleep five days prior to the show, and a wrist injury from a fall, took a toll on his health, and he needed morphine injections to get through the performance. Soon after the show, he suffered a minor heart attack.

===1974–1980: &quot;King Arthur&quot;, &quot;No Earthly Connection&quot;, and second Yes run===
During his recovery at Wexham Park Hospital, Wakeman started to write new music for his next album, &quot;The Myths and Legends of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table&quot;. Despite being advised to reduce his workload and temper his excessive lifestyle, Wakeman made plans to record and tour and continued to smoke and drink. In September and October 1974, he completed his debut North American tour, performing &quot;Journey to the Centre of the Earth&quot; plus selections from &quot;Six Wives&quot; with the National Philharmonic Orchestra, the Choir of America, and his rock band named The English Rock Ensemble. Under doctors&#x27; orders, Wakeman was required to pass a heart monitor test before each performance. The tour continued to Japan, Australia, and New Zealand, finishing in March 1975.
Recording for &quot;King Arthur&quot; finished in January 1975, and features the New World Orchestra, English Chamber Choir, and the Nottingham Festival Vocal Group. Its a concept album based on King Arthur and its related characters and stories. Following its release in March 1975, the album went to No. 2 in the UK and No. 21 in the US, and earned gold certifications in Brazil, Japan, and Australia. The album was promoted with three sold-out shows at Wembley Arena with Wakeman performing with an orchestra, choir, and his rock band to a total of 27,000 people. As the arena floor was already set up as an ice rink for a different attraction, Wakeman chose to present the show as an ice pageant with fourteen ice skaters and the musicians&#x27; stage placed in the round and decorated as a castle. The shows, though well received and a contributory factor to the album&#x27;s commercial success, were expensive to produce. In 2009, the concerts were listed in ranked 79th on VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Shocking Moments in Rock and Roll&quot; program. By 2008, the album had sold an estimated 12 million copies worldwide.

From 1979 to 2005 (excluding 2001), and from 2019 onwards, the BBC configured &quot;Arthur&quot; to be the opening theme of its electoral Broadcast in the United Kingdom.

Wakeman toured &quot;King Arthur&quot; with an augmented formation of the English Rock Ensemble for three months from October 1975, across North and South America. The stage production was scaled back in comparison to his previous tours, featuring only his rock band with a two-piece wind section. The line-up was Wakeman&#x27;s first with new drummer Tony Fernandez, who would perform on many of his future albums and tours. In 1975, Wakeman composed the soundtrack for &quot;Lisztomania&quot;, a biography film about composer Franz Liszt written and directed by Ken Russell. Wakeman appears in the film as Thor, the god of thunder. A few years later, he recalled the album in a more negative light as &quot;there was hardly anything of mine on it in the end&quot;, and criticised its mixing and production. &quot;No Earthly Connection&quot; (1976) was recorded in France and features Wakeman and his English Rock Ensemble. Initially it was to be about mythological gods, but its lyrical subject matter changed after he witnessed a flying object one night which inspired him to read up on the origins of man and mysterious phenomena such as the Bermuda Triangle, Stonehenge, and the pyramids. Wakeman wrote the album without playing any of its music beforehand, and summarised it in the liner notes: &quot;A futuristic, autobiographical look at music, the part it plays in our pre-earth, human and after life&quot;. Upon its release in April 1976, the album went to No. 9 in the UK and No. 67 in the US. Wakeman toured the album worldwide, which featured a scaled down stage production compared to his previous tours.

By the summer of 1976, Wakeman fell into financial trouble after touring had met its minimal expectations and its expenses had exceeded its profits, and had to come up with £350,000 &quot;in a matter of weeks&quot;. He sold his Rolls-Royces, ended his Fragile car service company, and disbanded the English Rock Ensemble, and saw further relief when A&amp;M agreed to pay royalties in advance. At the suggestion of Wakeman&#x27;s manager, Brian Lane, Wakeman rehearsed with Bill Bruford and John Wetton for six weeks with the plan to form a new band, but the story broke in &quot;Melody Maker&quot; which effectively caused the group to split. Wakeman took up work recording the soundtrack to &quot;White Rock&quot;, a documentary film about the 1976 Winter Olympics directed by Tony Maylam. The film premiered in February 1977 as a double bill with &quot;&quot;. The track &quot;After the Ball&quot; was one that Wakeman forgot to write; he proceeded to play it as a completely improvised single take, rather than confessing to the producers. In 1977, the press named Wakeman as one of the acts on A&amp;M Records who threatened to leave if the label signed the controversial punk band the Sex Pistols. He denied any involvement and said it was a publicity stunt derived by A&amp;M to drop the band. Wakeman was a key figure in getting American punk band The Tubes their first record deal, having suggested to George Daly that he contact A&amp;M executive Kip Cohen, who signed the group.

Wakeman&#x27;s fortunes changed when he was invited to join Yes in Montreux, Switzerland, as they were working on new songs for &quot;Going for the One&quot; (1977), in November 1976. Keyboardist Patrick Moraz had left during the early stages in part due to the &quot;enormous psychological pressures within the group&quot;. Upon hearing the band&#x27;s new material of more accessible and concise songs, Wakeman agreed to play on the album as a session musician and joined the band in Montreux. Wakeman subsequently agreed to rejoin the band full-time, but noticed the new edition of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; had printed the headline &quot;Wakeman rejoins Yes&quot; hours after he agreed. He then learned that Lane had informed the press of his return without consulting him. Wakeman described &quot;Going for the One&quot; as &quot;the album Yes should have made instead of &quot;Topographic Oceans&quot;&quot;, and considered the 15-minute track &quot;Awaken&quot; as one of the group&#x27;s best. &quot;Tormato&quot; (1978) features Wakeman playing a Birotron, a tape replay keyboard that used 8-track tape cartridges and contributed funds to its development. He is reported to have given the album its name by throwing a tomato at a showing of the art used for the album&#x27;s cover.

Wakeman&#x27;s final albums for A&amp;M were released in the late 1970s. &quot;Rick Wakeman&#x27;s Criminal Record&quot; (1977) is an instrumental rock album (apart from humorous vocals from Bill Oddie) similar to &quot;The Six Wives of Henry VIII&quot; but loosely based on criminality, and features Yes bandmates Chris Squire on bass and Alan White on drums, with Frank Ricotti on percussion. The album went to No. 25 in the UK and No. 128 in the US. The track &quot;Birdman of Alcatraz&quot; was used as the theme music to the BBC drama series &quot;My Son, My Son&quot; and subsequently released as a single. &quot;Rhapsodies&quot; (1979) was recorded in Montreux and released as a double album, with Wakeman playing shorter tracks of varied musical styles. It features Bruce Lynch, Frank Gibson Jr., and Tony Visconti as guest musicians. It also peaked at No. 25 in the UK. After touring with Yes in 1979, and failed attempts at making a new album with the band in Paris and London, Wakeman and Anderson left the group in early 1980.

===1980–1988: Albums for Charisma and President Records and venture into New-age and Christian music===
In 1980, after a four-year hiatus, Wakeman reformed the English Rock Ensemble for a European tour. Later that year he came close to forming a band with drummer Carl Palmer, bassist John Wetton, and guitarist Trevor Rabin, but opted out &quot;on a matter of principle&quot; as the record company was prepared to sign them without hearing any of the group&#x27;s music. He looked back at this moment: &quot;I basically sealed my financial fate, and things went downhill fast.&quot; His father&#x27;s death in November 1980 prompted him to leave Switzerland and return to the UK, which led to a record deal with Charisma Records to avoid bankruptcy. For several months of 1980 Wakeman was homeless due to his financial difficulties and second divorce, and resorted to sleeping on benches in Kensington Gardens until a former roadie let him sleep at his house.

Wakeman&#x27;s first album for Charisma was &quot;1984&quot;, a concept rock album based on George Orwell&#x27;s same-titled dystopian novel, with a band including Steve Barnacle on bass, Gary Barnacle on saxophone, and Frank Ricotti on drums. The album features tracks with Chaka Khan, Jon Anderson, Kenny Lynch, and Tim Rice on lead vocals, who also wrote the lyrics. &quot;1984&quot; was released in June 1981 and reached number 24 in the UK. Plans to have the album adapted into a musical were cancelled after lawyers from Orwell&#x27;s estate blocked its development. In July 1981, Wakeman performed &quot;Journey to the Centre of the Earth&quot; for two shows in Durban, South Africa. This was followed by a world tour until the end of 1981, with a line-up of Holt, Fernandez, Tim Stone on guitar, Steve Barnacle on bass, and Cori Josiah on vocals. The tour became problematic due to growing friction within the band. In the same year, Wakeman recorded the soundtrack to the slasher horror film &quot;The Burning&quot; in New York City.
Wakeman&#x27;s next album was &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Prophet&quot;, a humorous spoof on the pop duo the Buggles released in 1982 on his own label, Moon Records. Initially titled &quot;Maybe &#x27;80&quot;, it was recorded in Switzerland in 1979 but remained unreleased until he secured the rights for it following an appearance at the MIDEM music festival. A single from the album, &quot;I&#x27;m So Straight I&#x27;m a Weirdo&quot;, featuring Wakeman on lead vocals, was released in 1980. Wakeman hosted the Channel 4 music show &quot;Gastank&quot; with Tony Ashton that aired in January and February 1983. He then released a second album for Charisma, &quot;Cost of Living&quot;, a mixture of instrumental and rock tracks with Rice on vocals, which failed to impact the chart and &quot;did nothing&quot; to improve his finances. By this time, Wakeman was &quot;managerless, penniless and homeless&quot;. In February 1983, he and Carter moved to Camberley, Surrey after the birth of their daughter Jemma. Wakeman took up work by recording the soundtrack to the official 1982 FIFA World Cup documentary film &quot;G&#x27;olé!&quot;, which was released around the same time as &quot;Cost of Living&quot; which hampered potential sales. He wrote the soundtrack for the film &quot;She&quot; with assistance from Justin Hayward and Maggie Bell, and his second Russell feature, &quot;Crimes of Passion&quot;, with Bell on vocals, Fernandez on drums, and past Strawbs bandmate Chas Cronk on bass. Wakeman based the music around the themes of Symphony No. 9 by Antonín Dvořák. Wakeman also spent early 1983 writing the score to the ballet &quot;Killing Games&quot;, but problems during its development led to the project being shelved, along with a potential double album of its music. In early 1984, Wakeman contributed three songs to the soundtrack of &quot;B.C. Rock&quot;.

In 1984, Wakeman signed with the independent label President Records in an association that would last until 2007, for which he would produce almost 40 albums. The first was &quot;Silent Nights&quot;, Wakeman&#x27;s first solo album in over two years, featuring Fernandez, Cronk, and Rick Fenn on guitar and released in 1985. The single &quot;Glory Boys&quot; became a minor pop hit in the UK. In March 1985, Wakeman finished work on his part of the soundtrack to the comedy film &quot;Playing for Keeps&quot;, which was followed by a tour of the UK, North America, and Australia to promote &quot;Silent Nights&quot;. It was his first full-scale tour in four years, and his first shows in the US in over five. A live album from the UK leg was released as &quot;Live at Hammersmith&quot;. The tour left Wakeman &quot;seriously in debt&quot;, and he was forced to remortgage his Camberley home. In September 1985, during the tour&#x27;s Australian leg, Wakeman fell ill from his alcoholism and has been teetotal since. Also in 1985, a single of Wakeman&#x27;s theme tunes for the television shows &quot;Lytton&#x27;s Diary&quot; and &quot;Database&quot; was released. By this time he had also composed music for the BBC show &quot;Paddles Up&quot; and the Channel 4 documentary &quot;Supercat&quot;. Wakeman reunited with David Bowie to play the piano on his 1986 single &quot;Absolute Beginners&quot;.
The latter half of the 1980s saw Wakeman venture into new musical genres. In 1986, he released his first album of new age music titled &quot;Country Airs&quot;, formed of solo piano tracks inspired by walks in the countryside. It was a record he never had wanted to make, but was in need of money and accepted a £5,000 advance from Coda Records to record it. It reached number one on the UK new age chart. Wakeman followed this with a tour of the Far East, and soundtrack work for &quot;Hero&quot;, the film to the 1986 World Cup. In 1987, Wakeman joined the rock band Sky as a guest musician for an Australian tour. His association with new age music continued as the host of a weekly new age radio show on Capital Radio, and the release of &quot;The Family Album&quot;, with a track dedicated to each of his family members and pets. The original pressing included music Wakeman had composed for the BBC television film &quot;The Day After the Fair&quot; and the feature documentary &quot;Mackintosh&quot;. Also in 1987, Wakeman put out his first Christian music album titled &quot;The Gospels&quot;, a double album based on the four Gospels that features tenor vocalist Ramon Remedios, actor Robert Powell as narrator, and the Eton College Chapel Choir. The music was originally written for a 1985 concert as part of a fund raising event for a church before it was expanded into a full album. Wakeman played the album with Remedios and his band at the Royal Albert Hall in London and in the following year, in Caesarea, Israel that was broadcast internationally on television. He returned to rock with &quot;Time Machine&quot;, loosely based on the science fiction novel by H. G. Wells and features Roy Wood and Tracy Ackerman as guest vocalists. Released in 1988, Wakeman intended to record it with an orchestra and choir and put on a star-studded ice show, but the idea was cancelled due to lack of funds.

In March 1988, in a move to improve their finances, Wakeman and Carter sold their Camberley home and moved to Peel on the Isle of Man. A coach house on the site of their home was converted into a recording studio that Wakeman named Bajonor Studios, named after the first letters of his family. The 24-track studio was built as Wakeman had lost several opportunities to score films due to the high cost of renting large, professional studios, so he built his own as a compromise. Wakeman recorded there from 1990 until 2001. The new age-themed &quot;Aspirant Sunset&quot;, released in 1990, was the first, and marks the first album with his longtime recording engineer Stuart Sawney. Wakeman donated 50p from every sale of his &quot;Aspirant&quot; album trilogy to CPRE, The Countryside Charity. Wakeman befriended fellow Isle of Man resident Norman Wisdom, and the two made an album together.

===1988–1997: ABWH, third and fourth Yes runs, &quot;Phantom Power&quot;, and &quot;The Piano Album&quot;===
In late 1988, Wakeman got together with former Yes bandmates Jon Anderson, Bill Bruford, and Steve Howe to form a new group, Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe. The band originated when Anderson had become increasingly frustrated with Yes&#x27;s commercial direction, and left the band to make music that reflected the band&#x27;s 1970s sound. Their self-titled album was released in 1989, and the tour marked Wakeman&#x27;s first major US tour in ten years. Tracks originally put down for a second album were added to an in-progress Yes album and released as &quot;Union&quot; in 1991, which transformed Yes into an eight-piece formation with Wakeman sharing keyboards with original Yes member Tony Kaye. Wakeman has openly stated his dislike for &quot;Union&quot;, partly due to the fact that session musicians were brought in to re-write and perform parts that he and Howe had already put down. However, he later chose the Union Tour tour of 1991–1992 as his favourite with Yes, where he formed a strong friendship with their 1980s guitarist and singer-songwriter Trevor Rabin. Wakeman confirmed his exit from the group in 1993 following managerial disputes with the band&#x27;s and his own.

Wakeman continued with his solo career in parallel; in 1990 he revived his English Rock Ensemble with Holt, Fernandez, and Paton for a European tour and recorded a new rock score for a colourised re-release of &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, featuring Chrissie Hammond on vocals, put out as &quot;Phantom Power&quot; in 1991. He embarked on two UK tours supporting his two &quot;The Classical Connection&quot; albums with himself and Paton in a stripped back stage production. In the first half of the 1990s, Wakeman performed and released music in aid of ASSIST, a California-based Christian organisation founded by journalist Dan Wooding, author of Wakeman&#x27;s biography. The pair reconnected in 1989, and their first venture was &quot;In the Beginning&quot;, an album of atmospheric music with Biblical readings read by Wakeman&#x27;s then-wife Nina. Wakeman donated the album&#x27;s entire proceedings to ASSIST. In 1994, Wakeman completed the Simply Acoustic Tour, a series of solo piano concerts in the US in aid of ASSIST. Recordings from shows in Virginia and the Calvary Chapel in Costa Mesa, California was released on &quot;The Piano Album&quot; in 1995. The latter show was attended by 8,000 people. Wakeman formed Hope Records to release this new Christian music, and decided to use the royalty payments to fund the production of more albums for the label.
In October 1992, Wakeman embarked on a world tour with a four-piece group of Fernandez, guitarist and bassist Alan Thomson, and his son Adam Wakeman on additional keyboards. The tour lasted until 1994, and was organised as Wakeman wished to tour with a second keyboardist to &quot;free [him] up to do more things&quot; on stage. The tour marked the release of &quot;Wakeman with Wakeman&quot;, an album of keyboard compositions written and performed by the pair. They released &quot;No Expense Spared&quot; in 1993, &quot;Romance of the Victorian Age&quot; in 1994, and &quot;Vignettes&quot; in 1996. In 1993, Wakeman&#x27;s financial situation took an unexpected turn when he was demanded to pay almost £70,000 to the Inland Revenue for interest charges and unpaid penalties related to tax he had paid for the preceding six years. He later wrote: &quot;With help from Brian Lane&#x27;s office and Yes&#x27;s accountants, in my signing away all publishing income from everything I had ever written ... Twenty-two years&#x27; work had vanished in the three seconds it had taken to sign my name.&quot; Wakeman credits his 1993 appearance on the evening talk show &quot;Danny Baker After All&quot; as a turning point in his television career, after he told a story about being arrested in Moscow for smuggling a KGB uniform out of the country.

In mid-1995, Wakeman became involved with Phillip Gandey&#x27;s family circus entertainment project Cirque Surreal, writing and recording &quot;timeless&quot; pieces to enhance the show&#x27;s various characters. The show was initially held at the Brighton Festival, and Wakeman went out to perform it live with his band at other venues, including the Cheltenham Festival. Around the same time, Wakeman scored the soundtrack to &quot;Bullet to Beijing&quot;, a made-for-television film starring Michael Caine and Jason Connery. He also scored its sequel, &quot;Midnight in Saint Petersburg&quot;. Also in 1995, Wakeman played Mellotron on two songs of Ozzy Osbourne&#x27;s album &quot;Ozzmosis&quot;, &quot;Perry Mason&quot; and &quot;I Just Want You&quot;.

In the summer of 1995, Wakeman agreed to return to Yes which marked his fourth time in the group and the return of the &quot;classic&quot; line-up. They worked on new studio material and performed live shows in 1996 which was released on &quot;Keys to Ascension&quot; (1996) and &quot;Keys to Ascension 2&quot; (1997). In March 1997, Wakeman staged the North American premiere of &quot;The New Gospels&quot; for five dates after it was reworked and extended into a two-hour oratorio with a 30-piece choir, in 1994. The concerts were free with donations to ASSIST. Wakeman left Yes in May 1997 before he could tour with them, due to scheduling conflicts and lack of coordination between the artists&#x27; management. In June 1997, Wakeman became the host of the stand-up comedy television show &quot;Live at Jongleurs&quot;. Later in 1997, his 20-minute choral piece &quot;Noah&quot;, written for the English Chamber Choir, premiered in London. Wakeman performed the piece with the choir once more in 2011.

===1998–2008: &quot;Return to the Centre of the Earth&quot;, English Rock Ensemble revival, and final Yes run===
In 1998, he started work on &quot;Return to the Centre of the Earth&quot;, a sequel album to commemorate the 25th anniversary of &quot;Journey to the Centre of the Earth&quot;. The idea first came to Wakeman in 1991 during a tour of Italy, which led to discussions about the project with Atlantic Records that year about a re-recording of the original album with new equipment and arrangements, but the idea was rejected. It was revived in 1996 when Wakeman received offers from three record companies willing to fund and release a new &quot;epic&quot; album. After a deal with EMI Classics was made, a story based on three unnamed travellers and their attempt to follow the original route was finalised, and recording began in 1998 with a band, the London Symphony Orchestra, the English Chamber Choir, Patrick Stewart as the narrator, and guest performances from Trevor Rabin, Ozzy Osbourne, and Bonnie Tyler. Released in 1999, the album went to number 34 in the UK, Wakeman&#x27;s first album to enter the chart in 12 years. Recording was temporarily disrupted because of Wakeman&#x27;s health. In December 1998, Wakeman was featured on an episode of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;.

Wakeman accepted an invitation to revive his English Rock Ensemble for a South American tour in September 2000, following a renewed interest in progressive rock there. The band featured a new line-up of Fernandez, Damian Wilson on vocals, Adam Wakeman on keyboards, Ant Glynne on guitar, and Lee Pomeroy on bass. Wakeman was particularly pleased with his playing, calling it his &quot;best in a long time.&quot; The group returned in April 2001, followed by several European dates. Later that year, Wakeman entered discussions with Keith Emerson regarding a potential music project, but the idea was shelved. In 2001, Wakeman performed in his first pantomime role as Abanazar in a production of &quot;Aladdin&quot; in Truro, for the Christmas season. He made a cameo appearance in the 2002 thriller horror film &quot;Alone&quot; as a hospital patient. In 2003, Wakeman starred in the BBC television show &quot;Grumpy Old Men&quot;, and stayed on as a regular until the show ended in 2006. The show increased his national profile and made him a regular in the after dinner speech circuit.

In April 2002, Wakeman rejoined Yes for the fifth and final time, and said it took eight months to get the necessary paperwork to make it happen. The band toured worldwide with the Full Circle Tour and 35th Anniversary Tours, which ran from 2002 to 2004. Wakeman described the band&#x27;s playing during his return: &quot;It was far and away the best the band had ever been ... there was no staleness, there was a lot of freshness.&quot; The only new studio material worked on during this time were bonus tracks on &quot;The Ultimate Yes: 35th Anniversary Collection&quot;. After the 2004 tour Yes entered a four-year hiatus, during which Wakeman retired from large scale tours following ongoing health problems. When the band regrouped in 2008, Wakeman&#x27;s son Oliver replaced him on keyboards.

In April 2005, Wakeman and his band performed three shows in Havana, Cuba, including an outdoor show attended by an estimated 10,000 people. They came about after Wakeman was offered to perform there to support a charitable foundation that supports a children&#x27;s cancer hospital. The first two shows were filmed and released as &quot;Made in Cuba&quot;, proceeds from which were given to the hospital. Cuban leader Fidel Castro greeted Wakeman, thanking him for his humanitarian support. Wakeman received some criticism following the visit, which upset him personally and made him consider retiring from live performance. He addressed the false accusations on his website, clarifying that the visit was not staged for political reasons. Wakeman later revealed that Castro gave him some earth surrounding Che Guevara&#x27;s grave.

In June 2006, Wakeman toured the US with a solo piano tour. This was followed by a performance of &quot;Return to the Centre of the Earth&quot; with his band, orchestra, and choir in Quebec, Canada. The show featured Jon Anderson as a guest performer, which led to the pair touring the UK together as Anderson/Wakeman. Wakeman scored the 2007 documentary film &quot;In Search of the Great Beast 666&quot;, about the life of occultist Aleister Crowley. He toured the UK in 2007 with a new production, the Grumpy Old Picture Show. Inspired by his appearances on &quot;Grumpy Old Men&quot;, the show combined live performances and stories with visual accompaniments including old photos and pre-recorded sketches. The initial run of 14 dates were so successful, Wakeman completed a further 24 dates in the following year.

===2009–present: Revisiting classic 1970s albums, Yes feat. ARW, and piano albums===
In May 2009, Wakeman performed his debut album &quot;The Six Wives of Henry VIII&quot; in its entirety for the first time at Hampton Court Palace, as part of the 500th anniversary celebrations of Henry VIII&#x27;s accession to the throne. He had originally asked to perform there in 1973, but was declined until he was invited 36 years later. The shows were released on CD and DVD as &quot;The Six Wives of Henry VIII Live at Hampton Court Palace&quot;. In 2010, Wakeman was awarded the Spirit of Prog Award at the annual Classic Rock Roll of Honour Awards.
In 2012, Wakeman recorded a new and extended version of &quot;Journey to the Centre of the Earth&quot;, following the discovery of the original conductor&#x27;s score three years prior which was considered lost. As the original album was shortened to fit a single LP, Wakeman re-recorded the album with the previously cut parts which expanded the work to 54 minutes. It features his English Rock Ensemble, the Orion Orchestra and English Chamber Choir conducted by Guy Protheroe, and narration by actor Peter Egan. In April and May 2014, Wakeman performed the expanded album on a 14-date UK tour to commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the original. The re-recording of &quot;Journey&quot; became the catalyst for a new and expanded version of &quot;King Arthur&quot;, following a request from a South American concert promoter, for which Wakeman wrote new music based on additional Arthurian legends. The re-record version runs for 88 minutes, and features actor Ian Lavender as narrator. It was Wakeman&#x27;s first album produced via online direct-to-fan support, and released on 19 June 2016, the same day that Wakeman performed it live at London&#x27;s O2 Arena for the Stone Free Festival.

In 2013, Wakeman played on &quot;The Theory of Everything&quot; by Ayreon. In August 2013, Wakeman performed 12 solo piano shows as part of the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. In June 2015 he announced Wakemanfest, a three-day music festival at the Gliderdrome in Boston, Lincolnshire that October, featuring performances from himself and the English Rock Ensemble, the Strawbs, The Cadbury Sisters, and Chrissie Hammond. It was postponed, in addition to a piano tour of Scandinavia following the festival, after Wakeman had an undisclosed &quot;serious health scare&quot; and took time off at the suggestion of his management and family. In January 2016, Wakeman reunited with former Yes bandmates Jon Anderson and Trevor Rabin and the three announced the formation of their new band, Anderson Rabin Wakeman, later renamed Yes Featuring Jon Anderson, Trevor Rabin, Rick Wakeman. The three toured from 2016 to 2018, performing Yes music across the band&#x27;s history.

In January 2016, Wakeman performed a piano version of &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; live on BBC Radio 2 as a tribute following the death of his longtime friend David Bowie. The strong reception from listeners and viewers of the YouTube video led Wakeman to release a single of the track with a piano version of &quot;Space Oddity&quot; and an original song, &quot;Always Together&quot;, in aid of Macmillan Cancer Support. The reception from the single and YouTube video inspired Wakeman to produce a solo piano album of tracks that he had played on in his career, plus original tunes and adaptations of classical pieces. &quot;Piano Portraits&quot; was released in January 2017 and peaked at No. 7 in the UK, Wakeman&#x27;s highest-charting album since 1975. It also reached gold certification from the British Phonographic Institute. In 2018, Wakeman released a follow-up, &quot;Piano Odyssey&quot;, this time with some orchestral arrangements. Like its predecessor, the album reached No. 7 in the UK. He concluded the series of piano albums with &quot;Christmas Portraits&quot;, a Christmas-themed piano album, in 2019. In September and October 2019, Wakeman embarked on his first solo tour of the US in 13 years, playing piano shows.

In June 2020, Wakeman returned to his progressive rock roots with &quot;The Red Planet&quot;, an instrumental album inspired by Mars and featuring his English Rock Ensemble. In March 2023, Wakeman released &quot;A Gallery of the Imagination&quot;, featuring tracks of varied styles including songs and instrumentals.

In February 2023, Wakeman and his band performed two shows at the London Palladium featuring &quot;The Six Wives of Henry VIII&quot;, &quot;Journey to the Centre of the Earth&quot; and &quot;King Arthur&quot; performed in their entirety, plus a selection of songs he performed with Yes. The shows were released as a live album. In February 2024, he toured the UK with the &quot;Journey to the Centre of the Earth&quot; and Yes sets, followed by the start of his Final One Man Solo Tour of North America. The tour featured the debut of his 30-minute piano composition &quot;Yessonata&quot;, featuring various themes and melodies from Yes songs that he had originally played on. In November 2024 a 20-minute recorded version of &quot;Yessonata&quot; was released as an album of the same name, paired with a piano suite of similar length based on themes from &quot;King Arthur&quot;. Wakeman composed an orchestral piece as a tribute to the life and achievements of primatologist and climate campaigner Jane Goodall for the 2024 Starmus Festival, which he performed with himself on piano.

==Instruments==

By the end of 1972, Wakeman&#x27;s typical keyboard setup included piano, electric piano, Mellotron, Hammond organ, and Minimoog synthesizer, and had played a pipe organ and harpsichord on record. He went on to use many later models of synthesizers including the Polymoog and the short-lived Birotron, which he helped fund in its development. Because of the advent of digital keyboards at that time, and expensive components used in the instruments&#x27; manufacture, the Birotron was never a commercial or technical success and only 35 were produced. In recent years, Wakeman has used various Korg models, a Yamaha Montage, and the Memotron, a digital version of the original Mellotron.

An urban legend claims that Wakeman got so frustrated with one Mellotron that he poured petrol on it and set fire to it, which he said in 2010 was only &quot;semi-true&quot;, and had become an exaggerated story over time. He clarified that some were so far beyond repair they were taken apart and burnt, but he kept the frames. A double Mellotron that he had made was stolen which reappeared in America.

In addition to keyboards, Wakeman still owns the soprano saxophone that he used at the Royal College of Music, and can play some rhythm and bass guitar.

==Recognition and influence==
In his foreword for Wakeman&#x27;s 1979 biography, Elton John named &quot;The Six Wives of Henry VIII&quot; as one of his favourite albums. He noted Wakeman&#x27;s &quot;brilliant&quot; technique and wrote that his &quot;mastery of electronic instruments only adds to his abilities&quot;. In 2011, MusicRadar included Wakeman among &quot;The 27 greatest keyboard players of all time&quot;. In 2019, readers of &quot;Prog&quot; voted him the second greatest progressive rock keyboard player, with the magazine stating, &quot;Wakeman&#x27;s time with Yes helped define prog as we know it, being filled with timeless brilliance [...] The man&#x27;s style is fluent, and underlines a love of many genres, all cohesively brought into focus.&quot; In 2024, Neil McCormick of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; ranked him as the second greatest keyboard player of all time.

Keyboardists who have cited Wakeman as an influence included Dave Greenfield of the Stranglers and Mark Kelly of Marillion, who cited Wakeman as his primary influence.

==Personal life==
===Family===
Wakeman has been married four times and has six children. At the age of 20, he married Rosaline Woolford on 28 March 1970 and had two sons, Oliver and Adam. They divorced in 1977. Wakeman then married Swiss-born Danielle Corminboeuf, a recording studio secretary, in January 1980 in the West Indies and lived with her in Montreux. They had one son, before they divorced in late 1980. In 1981, Wakeman met former Page 3 model Nina Carter and had a daughter, before they married in November 1984 and had a son. The couple separated in 2000 and divorced in 2004.

In 2004, Wakeman revealed that he had had an extramarital affair with American-born designer Denise Gandrup, who first met Wakeman in 1972 and made several of his capes. After they split in 1981, they reconnected in 1985 and had one daughter. Wakeman felt it best to keep the relationship and child secret to protect his family, but continued to financially support his daughter.

In December 2011, Wakeman married journalist Rachel Kaufman.

===Health===
Wakeman has faced a number of health issues. In his twenties he suffered three heart attacks due to his unhealthy lifestyle of smoking and heavy drinking. The first two were minor and he was told they may have gone unnoticed. The third occurred soon after a performance of &quot;Journey to the Centre of the Earth&quot; at Crystal Palace Park in July 1974. Wakeman stopped smoking in 1979.

In September 1984, Wakeman was fined £155 and banned from driving for one year for speeding and being over the drink drive limit. In 1985, Wakeman&#x27;s drinking led to cirrhosis of the liver and alcoholic hepatitis, and he has been teetotal since. In 1998, Wakeman collapsed on a golf course and was rushed to hospital, where he was diagnosed with double pneumonia, pleurisy, and showed signs of Legionnaire&#x27;s disease. He was placed in an induced coma, and at one point his doctors gave him 24 hours to live. Wakeman has had a vasectomy.

In 2016 Wakeman announced he had type-2 diabetes. In 2023 he said his performing was affected by macular degeneration in his left eye and arthritis in his hands and feet. Wakeman has never used drugs, and believes that had he taken them he would have done so to excess and died.

===Other activities===
In the 1970s, Wakeman met Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother and bought Tropical Saint, a racehorse that belonged to her. After it died, he bought Balinloning, a small horse that he had in care for a year and entered in races. In 1979, he became a director of Brentford F.C., a post which he held for a year. In 1983, he became chairman of Camberley Town F.C.; he quit in 1987 due to his busy work schedule, but remained active as an honorary vice-president. In 2009, he became a patron of Tech Music Schools. Wakeman is an honorary president of the Classic Rock Society, formed in Rotherham in 1991. He was one of the board of directors of the Performing Artists&#x27; Media Rights Association (PAMRA), a non-profit organisation committed to promoting musicians&#x27; rights and income.

Wakeman had a renewal of his Christian faith which began at around the time of his 1984 marriage to Carter.

In the 1990s, Wakeman bought a house in Los Cristianos, Tenerife.

In 1988, Wakeman was elected into the Lord&#x27;s Taverners cricket charity, and was chairman of the Isle of Man branch with his wife in the early 1990s. He took up golf in the 1980s after becoming teetotal, and has since taken part in many charity tournaments. From 1995 until at least 2012, the Rick Wakeman Celebrity Classic golf tournament took place at Burhill Golf Club in Surrey, raising funds in aid of the children&#x27;s charity Sparks. In 2017, Wakeman was made an ambassador to the animal welfare charity Animals Asia Foundation, of which he has supported since 2013.

In 1993 Wakeman was invited to play the piano at the inauguration of US President Bill Clinton. He declined due to unavailability.

In October 1997, Wakeman received a Golden Badge Award from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors (BASCA), given for outstanding contributions to the British music and entertainment industry. In 2008, Wakeman gave a class to students of the London College of Music and later that year, received an honorary professorship from the college for his contributions to music. In 2012, Wakeman received an honorary fellowship of the Royal College of Music in a ceremony presented by HRH The Prince of Wales, the college&#x27;s president. In 2022, he received the Musicians&#x27; Company Honorary Fellowship at the Royal College. Wakeman was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2021 Birthday Honours for services to music and broadcasting. He is a Freeman of the City of London, and a liveryman of the Worshipful Company of Glovers.

In September 2005 Wakeman began a weekly three-hour radio show on Planet Rock called &quot;Rick&#x27;s Place&quot;, broadcasting Saturday mornings. The show ended in December 2010. 
In late 2020, Wakeman launched &quot;Rick&#x27;s Plaice&quot;, a subscription-based video series based on the format of his former Planet Rock show.

In 2007 Wakeman became a Freemason, joining the Chelsea Lodge No. 3098 which is made up of entertainers. His father was a member of the Brent Valley Lodge No. 3940, and the support that Wakeman and his mother received from his friends at the Lodge following his death was a catalyst for Wakeman to learn more about Freemasonry. In 2019, Wakeman was elected as an honorary member of his late father&#x27;s Lodge. In 2011, Wakeman joined the Knights Templar fraternity, and is also a member of the Vaudeville Lodge. In 2014 he was installed as the 110th Worshipful Master of the Chelsea Lodge. He was and elected as the 125th King Rat in the showbusiness fraternity and charity organisation, the Grand Order of Water Rats. Wakeman was the first person to hold both titles. He hosted the Grumpy Old Rockstar&#x27;s Chelsea Lodge Ladies Festival in the following year. Wakeman appears in his Masonic apron in the 2017 documentary series &quot;Inside the Freemasons&quot;.

In a 2010 interview, Wakeman was critical of Wikipedia, saying it has too many inaccuracies and mistakes, and that he would love to see it &quot;closed down&quot;.

In June 2017 he was the castaway for the BBC Radio 4 programme &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;. His favourite piece was Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Anvil Chorus&quot; and his book choice was &quot;Principles of Orchestration&quot; by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, which his orchestration professor at the Royal College had introduced to him.

Wakeman&#x27;s agent for TV and media work is entertainer Roger De Courcey, best known for performing with his puppet Nookie Bear.

Wakeman has been a supporter of the Conservative Party, saying he was &quot;unique in [Yes] as a card-carrying Conservative&quot;.

<doc id="57669" wikidata="Q3935" url="?curid=57669" title="Windhoek">
<text>Windhoek (; ; ) is the capital and largest city of Namibia. It is located in central Namibia in the Khomas Highland plateau area, at around above sea level, almost exactly at the country&#x27;s geographical centre. The population of Windhoek, was 486,169 in 2023, is constantly growing due to a continued migration from other regions in Namibia.

Windhoek is the social, economic, political, and cultural centre of the country. Nearly every Namibian national enterprise, governmental body, educational and cultural institution is headquartered there.

The city developed at the site of a permanent hot spring known to the local pastoral tribes. It developed rapidly after Jonker Afrikaner, Captain of the Orlam, settled there in 1840 and built a stone church for his community. In the decades following, multiple wars and armed hostilities resulted in the neglect and destruction of the new settlement. Windhoek was founded a second time in 1890 by Imperial German Army Major Curt von François, when the territory was colonised by the German Empire.

==History==
===Etymology===
Theories vary on how the city got its modern name of Windhoek. Most believe it is derived from the Afrikaans words &quot;wind&quot; (meaning wind) and &quot;hoek&quot; (meaning corner). Another theory suggests that Captain Jonker Afrikaner named Windhoek after the Winterhoek Mountains at Tulbagh in South Africa, where his ancestors had lived. The first known mention of the name &quot;Windhoek&quot; was in a letter from Jonker Afrikaner to Joseph Tindall, dated 12 August 1844.

===Early settlement===
In 1840 Jonker Afrikaner established an Orlam settlement at Windhoek. He and his followers stayed near one of the main hot springs, located in the present-day Klein Windhoek suburb. He built a stone church that held 500 people; it was also used as a school. Two Rhenish missionaries, Carl Hugo Hahn and Franz Heinrich Kleinschmidt, started working there in late 1842. Two years later they were driven out by two Methodist Wesleyans, Richard Haddy and Joseph Tindall. Gardens were laid out and for a while Windhoek prospered. A series of wars between the Nama and Herero tribes eventually destroyed the settlement. After a long absence, Hahn visited Windhoek again in 1873 and was dismayed to see that nothing remained of the town&#x27;s former prosperity. In June 1885, a Swiss botanist found only jackals and starving guinea fowl amongst neglected fruit trees.

===Colonial era===

A request by merchants from Lüderitzbucht resulted in the declaration in 1884 of a German protectorate over what was called German South West Africa (&quot;Deutsch-Südwestafrika&quot;), now Namibia. The borders of the German colony were determined in 1890 and Germany sent a protective corps, the &quot;Schutztruppe&quot; under Major Curt von François, to maintain order. Von François stationed his garrison at Windhoek, which was strategically situated as a buffer between the warring Nama and Herero peoples. The twelve strong springs provided water for the cultivation of produce and grains.

Colonial Windhoek was founded on 18 October 1890, when von François fixed the foundation stone of the fort, which is now known as the Alte Feste (Old Fortress). After 1907, development accelerated as indigenous people migrated from the countryside to the growing town to seek work. More European settlers arrived from Germany and South Africa. Businesses were erected on Kaiser Street (presently Independence Avenue), and along the dominant mountain ridge over the city. At this time, Windhoek&#x27;s three castles, Heinitzburg, Sanderburg, and Schwerinsburg, were built.

===South African administration after World War I===
The German colonial era came to an end after the end of World War I but South West Africa, and with it Windhoek, had already fallen in 1915. Until the end of the war, the city was administered by a South African military government, and no further development occurred. In 1920, after the Treaty of Versailles, the territory was placed under a League of Nations Class C mandate and again administered by South Africa.

After World War II, more capital became available to improve the area&#x27;s economy. After 1955, large public projects were undertaken, such as the building of new schools and hospitals, tarring of the city&#x27;s roads (a project begun in 1928 with Kaiser Street), and the building of dams and pipelines to stabilise the water supply. The city introduced the world&#x27;s first potable re-use plant in 1958, treating recycled sewage and sending it directly into the town&#x27;s water supply. On 1 October 1966, the then Administrator of South West Africa granted Windhoek the coat of arms, which was registered on 2 October 1970 with the South African Bureau of Heraldry. Initially a stylized aloe was the principal emblem, but this was amended to a natural aloe (&quot;Aloe littoralis&quot;) on 15 September 1972. The Coat of Arms is described as &quot;A Windhoek aloe with a raceme of three flowers on an island. Crest: A mural crown Or. Motto: SUUM CUIQUE (&quot;To each their own&quot;)&quot;.

Windhoek formally received its town privileges on 18 October 1965 on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the second foundation of the town by von François.

In 1971, the Namibian general contract workers started from Windhoek with the goal of abolishing the contract labour system, opposing apartheid, and promoting Namibia&#x27;s independence.

===Since Namibian independence===
Since independence in 1990, Windhoek has remained the national capital, as well as the provincial capital of the central Khomas Region. Since independence and the end of warfare, the city has had accelerated growth and development.

==Economy ==
The city is the administrative, commercial, and industrial centre of Namibia. A 1992/93 study estimated that Windhoek provides over half of Namibia&#x27;s non-agricultural employment, with its national share of employment in utilities being 96%, in transport and communication 94%, finance and business services 82%. Due to its relative size Windhoek is, even more than many other national capital cities, the social, economic, and cultural centre of the country. The University of Namibia is based in the city, as well as nearly every national enterprise, including the country&#x27;s only theatre, all ministry head offices, and all major media and financial entities. The governmental budget of the city of Windhoek nearly equals those of all other Namibian local authorities combined. Of the 3,300 US$-millionaires in Namibia, 1,400 live in Windhoek.

The Windhoek Correctional Facility is the largest of Namibia&#x27;s seven major prisons.

==Transport==

===Road===
Windhoek&#x27;s three main access roads from Rehoboth, Gobabis, and Okahandja are paved, and are designed to be able to withstand the largest possible flood to be expected in fifty years. Sealed roads can carry traffic moving at and should last for 20 years.

In 1928, Kaiserstraße, now Independence Avenue, was the first paved road in Windhoek. Ten years later the next one, Gobabis road, now Sam Nujoma Drive, was also paved. Today, out of approximately of Namibia&#x27;s total road network, about is sealed.

In 2014, The Roads Authority planned to upgrade the Windhoek-Okahandja road to a dual carriageway. It would cost about N$1 billion and was expected to be completed in 2021. Later on, they also planned to upgrade the Windhoek and Hosea Kutako International Airport to a dual carriageway. This was expected to be completed in 2022.

As everywhere in Namibia, public transport is scarce and transportation across town is largely done by taxi; there were 6,492 registered taxis in 2013.

===Air===
Windhoek is served by two airports, with the closest one being Eros Airport, located south of the city centre for smaller craft, and the other being Hosea Kutako International Airport, east of the city. A number of foreign airlines operate to and from Windhoek. Air charters and helicopter and fixed-wing aircraft rentals are also available.

Hosea Kutako International Airport handles over 800,000 passengers a year. It has one runway without capacity limitations. The other international airport is located in Walvis Bay, with domestic airports at Lüderitz, Oranjemund, and Ondangwa.

Eros Airport is the busiest airport in Namibia in terms of takeoffs and landings. This city airport handles approximately 150 to 200 movements per day, amounting to roughly 50,000 per year. In 2004, the airport served 141,605 passengers, the majority of which are light aircraft. Primarily, limitations such as runway length, noise, and air space congestion have kept Eros from developing into a larger airport. Most of Namibia&#x27;s charter operators have Eros as their base.

===Rail===

Windhoek is connected by rail to:

*Okahandja (north)
*Rehoboth (south)
*Gobabis (east)

==Geography==
Expanding the town area has – apart from financial restrictions – proven to be challenging due to its geographical location. In southern, eastern and western directions, Windhoek is surrounded by rocky, mountainous areas, which make land development costly. The southern side is not suitable for industrial development because of the presence of underground aquifers. This leaves the vast Brakwater area north of town the only feasible place for Windhoek&#x27;s expansion.

Windhoek&#x27;s city council has plans to dramatically expand the city&#x27;s boundaries such that the town area will cover . Windhoek would become the third-largest city in the world by area, after Tianjin and Istanbul, although its population density is only 63 inhabitants per square kilometre.

In many of Windhoek&#x27;s townships residents live in shacks. In 2020 the city had a total of 41,900 of these informal housing structures, accommodating close to 100,000 inhabitants.
===Climate===
Windhoek has over 300 sunny days per year. It experiences a hot semi-arid climate (&quot;BSh&quot;) according to Köppen climate classification as the annual average temperature is above . The temperature throughout the year would be called mild, due to altitude influence. The annual average high and low temperature range is . The coldest month is July, with an average temperature of , while the hottest month is December, with average temperature . Due to its location near the Kalahari Desert, the city receives 3,605 hours of sunshine. Precipitation is abundant during the summer season, and minimal during the winter season. The average annual precipitation is , with lows of in the 2018/19 rainy season, and in 1929/30.
===Demographics===
In 1971, there were roughly 26,000 whites living in Windhoek, outnumbering the black population of 24,000. About one third of white residents at the time, at least 9,000 individuals, were German speakers. Windhoek&#x27;s population stands at over 325,858 (65% black; 18% other; 17% white), and is growing 4% annually in part due to informal settlements that have even higher growth rates of nearly 10% a year. In public life, Afrikaans, and to a lesser extent German, are still used as lingua francas even though the government only uses English. Currently Windhoek has a population of 431,000 as of 2020.

==Politics==
===Local authority elections===
Windhoek is the only self-governed settlement in Khomas Region. It is governed by a multi-party municipal council that has fifteen seats. The council meets monthly; its decisions are taken collectively.

SWAPO won the 2015 local authority election and gained twelve seats, by having 37,533 votes. Three opposition parties gained one seat each: The Popular Democratic Movement (PDM), formerly DTA, with 4,171 votes, the National Unity Democratic Organisation (NUDO) with 1,453 votes, and the Rally for Democracy and Progress (RDP) with 1,422 votes. SWAPO also won the 2020 local authority election but lost the majority control over the town council. It obtained 20,250 votes and gained five seats. The Independent Patriots for Change (IPC), an opposition party formed in August 2020, obtained 14,028 votes and gained four seats. Two seats each went to the local branch of the Affirmative Repositioning movement (8,501 votes) and the Landless People&#x27;s Movement (LPM, a new party registered in 2018, 7,365 votes). PDM (5,411 votes) and NUDO (1,455 votes) obtained one seat each.

<doc id="57671" wikidata="Q3808" url="?curid=57671" title="Yaoundé">
<text>Yaoundé (; , ) is the capital city of Cameroon. It has a population of more than 2.8 million which makes it the second-largest city in the country after the port city Douala. It lies in the Centre Region of the nation at an elevation of about 750 metres (2,500 ft) above sea level.

The outpost of Epsumb or Jeundo was founded between the Nyong and Sanaga rivers at the northern edge of the area&#x27;s forests in 1887 by German explorers as a trading base for rubber and ivory. A military garrison was built in 1895 which enabled further colonization. After Imperial Germany&#x27;s defeat in World War I, France held eastern Cameroon as a mandate, and Yaoundé was chosen to become the capital of the colony in 1922.

Douala remained the more important settlement, but Yaoundé saw rapid growth and continued as the seat of government for the Republic of Cameroon upon its independence in 1960. Most of Yaoundé&#x27;s economy is still centred on the administrative structure but major industries in Yaoundé include tobacco, dairy products, beer, clay, glass goods and timber. The city has many striking monuments and buildings, such as the Presidential Palace and Palais des Congrès.

==History==
The earliest inhabitants of Cameroon were likely the Bakas (pygmies). They still inhabit the forests of the south and east regions. Bantu speakers originating in the Cameroonian highlands were among the first groups to move out before other invaders. During the late 1770s and early 1800s, the Fulani—a pastoral Islamic people of the western Sahel—conquered most of what is now northern Cameroon, subjugating or displacing its largely non-Muslim inhabitants.

The outpost of Epsumb or Jeundo was founded between the Nyong and Sanaga rivers at the northern edge of the area&#x27;s forests in 1887, 1888, or February 1889 by the German explorers Lt. Richard Kund and Hans Tappenbeck by the agreement of the chiefs of Ela Esono. From December 1889 to May 1895, it was occupied by the German botanist Georg August Zenker as an agricultural research station named Jaunde after the local Yaunde or Ewondo people. His settlement served as a base for the area&#x27;s rubber and ivory trade, purchasing these from the natives in exchange for imported clothing and iron. It was also known in English as Yaunde Station. Major Dominik&#x27;s establishment of a military garrison at the site in 1895 permitted a Pallotine mission and religious school at nearby Mvolyé (now a suburb).

During World War I, Jaunde was occupied by Belgian troops from the Congo. After Imperial Germany&#x27;s defeat in that war, France held eastern Cameroon as a mandate of the League of Nations and Yaoundé was chosen to become the capital of the colony in 1922.
Douala long remained the more important settlement, but Yaoundé saw rapid growth after 1957 due to the cocoa crisis and unrest along the coast. It continued as the seat of government for the Republic of Cameroon upon its independence.

==Economy==
Most of Yaoundé&#x27;s economy is centred on the administrative structure of the civil service and the diplomatic services. Owing to these high-profile central structures, Yaounde has a higher standard of living and security than the rest of Cameroon.

Major industries in Yaoundé include tobacco, dairy products, beer, clay, glass goods and timber. It is also a regional distribution centre for coffee, cocoa, copra, sugar cane and rubber.

Local residents engage in urban agriculture. The city is estimated to have &quot;50,000 pigs and over a million chickens.&quot;

In 2010, under Mayor Jean Claude Adjessa Melingui, Yaoundé began a flood reduction project, the Yaoundé City Sanitation Master Plan, to deal with &quot;severe floods [that] disrupted the city 15 to 20 times a year, affecting as many as 100,000 people at a time.&quot; After four years, the frequency of flooding had been reduced from fifteen to three times a year, and cases of water-borne diseases such as typhoid and malaria were reduced by almost half. Although Melingui died in 2013, local officials are continuing his efforts to transform the city. Ongoing improvements to sanitation infrastructure are being carried out under a &quot;$152 million plan, largely financed by loans, primarily from the African Development Bank and the French Development Agency&quot;, slated for completion in 2017.

Despite the security issues and humanitarian crises that have plagued the central African nation, its economy remains stable. In fact, there is diversification of its productive economic activities, with the services sector contributing about half of the total domestic production. However, like many African countries, Cameroon has long suffered from corruption, which dominates almost all the sectors, particularly in the capital city. Oil, gas and mining revenues are rarely reported, which implies massive graft. In addition, there is weak protection of real and intellectual property, and the judicial system is vulnerable to political manipulation.

According to Yaoundé City Council data, over 130 floods struck the city between 1980 and 2014, causing massive loss of life and economic damage. However, there has been a reduction of flooding in the city since the establishment of a sanitation master plan to address the issue. Another measure was to relocate people living along the drainage routes and in low-lying flood zones.

== Architecture ==
The city centre houses government offices, some hotels, and the central market. The Bastos district, with most homes owned by Cameroonians, is home to foreign embassies and the expatriate European, American and other continental communities (drawn mainly from the diplomatic corps). The presidential palace and compound are in the Etoudi district.

Also found in Yaoundé are:
* the Reunification Monument
* the Sport Palace (&quot;Palais des Sports&quot;)
* Palais des Congrès

There is a small zoo in the Mvog-Betsi neighbourhood. Yaoundé has a small assortment of Pubs, nightclubs and restaurants.
A distance outside Yaoundé is the NGO Ape Action Africa, which rescues and rehabilitates Great Apes threatened with extinction by the illegal bushmeat and deforestation trades.

== Culture ==
* the Cameroon Art Museum (located in a former Benedictine monastery)
* the Cameroon National Museum (located in the former presidential palace)
* the Blackitude Museum
* the Afhemi Museum
* The Yaoundé Municipal Lake
* The Mvog-Betsi Zoo-Botanic Park
* The Congress Centre in Tsinga

== Places of worship ==

The places of worship in the city are predominantly Christian churches: Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Yaoundé (Catholic Church), Christian Missionary Fellowship International and Associated Churches (Pentecostal), Evangelical Church of Cameroon (World Communion of Reformed Churches), Presbyterian Church in Cameroon (World Communion of Reformed Churches), Union of Baptist Churches in Cameroon (Baptist World Alliance), Full Gospel Mission Cameroon (Assemblies of God). There are also Muslim mosques.

==Climate==
Yaoundé features a tropical wet and dry climate (Aw), and it is thermally equatorial rather than tropical, with a narrow range of monthly temperatures throughout the year. However, primarily due to the altitude, temperatures are not quite as hot as one would expect for a city located near the equator. Yaoundé features a lengthy wet season, covering a ten-month span between March and November. However, there is a noticeable decrease in precipitation within the wet season, seen during the month of July, almost giving the city the appearance of having two separate rainy seasons; this is because the city is only slightly north of the equator. It is primarily due to the relative lull in precipitation during this month that Yaoundé features a tropical wet and dry climate, as opposed to a tropical monsoon climate.

==Transport==
Two trans-African automobile routes pass through Yaoundé:
* Tripoli-Cape Town Highway 

* Lagos-Mombasa Highway

Many bus companies operate from the city; particularly in the Nsam and Mvan districts. Frequent buses run on the road between Yaoundé and Douala, which has witnessed several fatal accidents. Travel time by road between Douala and Yaounde is approximately 3 hours. Traffic in the city can be heavy during weekdays, but is very light during the weekends. Yaoundé has made significant progress in infrastructure, especially road construction.

Yaoundé Nsimalen International Airport is a major civilian hub, while nearby Yaoundé Airport is used by the military.

Train lines run west to the port city of Douala and north to N&#x27;Gaoundéré.

==Education==
Cameroon is a bilingual country, where English and French are both official languages; therefore in the city there is a coexistence of French educational system schools, where the degree giving access to university is the Baccalaureate, and all the education is in French, and the English educational system schools, where the degree giving access to university is the GCE Advanced level.

There are three American schools in Cameroon, the American School of Yaounde (ASOY) and Rain Forest International School (RFIS), and the American School of Douala (ASD). There is also one Turkish School, The Amity College/School.

Yaoundé is the site of several universities: the University of Yaoundé II (on a campus outside of town), the Protestant University of Central Africa (UPAC) and the Catholic University of Central Africa (UCAC). Several of the nation&#x27;s professional schools are also located in Yaounde (Higher Teacher&#x27;s training college, École Militaire InterArmes du Cameroun) as well as various schools for Engineers (Polytech), Doctors (CUSS), Nurses and Diplomats.

== Healthcare ==
The largest hospital is the Central Hospital of Yaoundé (&quot;Hôpital Central de Yaoundé&quot;) with 650 beds. Yaoundé General Hospital (&quot;Hôpital Général de Yaoundé&quot; – HGY) had 302 beds when it was built in 1985. Other hospitals are the Yaoundé Gynaecology, Obstetrics and Pediatrics Hospital (&quot;Hôpital Gynéco-Obstétrique et Pédiatrique de Yaoundé&quot; – HGOPY) and the University Hospital Center of Yaoundé (&quot;Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Yaoundé&quot; – CHU).

==Sports==
The national football team plays some of its home matches in the Ahmadou Ahidjo stadium and the football clubs Canon Yaoundé, Impôts FC and Tonnerre Yaoundé are all based in the city. The Grand Prix Chantal Biya, a men&#x27;s road bicycle racing event on the UCI Africa Tour, starts and finishes in Yaoundé.

Yaoundé is also the base for the National Institute of Youth and Sport (INJS); this school trains government workers who will be in charge of sport all across the country during their career.

Joel Embiid, center for the Philadelphia 76ers, and Luc Mbah a Moute, who was a forward for the Los Angeles Clippers are from Yaoundé, as are Samuel Umtiti, a footballer for the national team of France and FC Barcelona, Breel Embolo, a footballer for AS Monaco FC and Vincent Aboubakar, a footballer for Porto.

<doc id="57677" wikidata="Q312327" url="?curid=57677" title="Nobuo Uematsu">
<text>is a Japanese composer and keyboardist best known for his contributions to the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; video game series by Square Enix. A self-taught musician, he began playing the piano at the age of twelve, with English singer-songwriter Elton John as one of his biggest influences in pursuing a musical career.

Uematsu joined Square in 1986, where he first met &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; creator Hironobu Sakaguchi. The two later worked together on many games at the company, most notably in the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series. After nearly two decades with Square, Uematsu left in 2004 to create his own production company and music label, Dog Ear Records. He has since composed music as a freelancer for other games, including ones developed by Square Enix and Sakaguchi&#x27;s studio Mistwalker.

Many soundtracks and arranged albums of Uematsu&#x27;s game scores have been released. Pieces from his video game works have been performed in various &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; concerts, where he has worked with conductor Arnie Roth and Game Concerts producer Thomas Böcker on several of these performances. Uematsu was also the keyboardist in The Black Mages in the 2000s, which played various hard rock versions of his &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; compositions. He has since performed with the Earthbound Papas, which he formed as the successor to The Black Mages in 2011. Uematsu has made several listings in Britain&#x27;s Classic FM Hall of Fame, with the station referring to him as the Beethoven of game music.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Uematsu was born in Kōchi, Kōchi, Japan. A self-taught musician, he began to play the piano when he was twelve years old, and did not take any formal piano lessons. He has an older sister who also played the piano. After graduating from Kanagawa University with a degree in English, Uematsu played the keyboard in several amateur bands and composed music for television commercials. When Uematsu was working at a music rental shop in Tokyo, a Square employee asked if he would be interested in creating music for some of the titles they were working on. Although he agreed, Uematsu at the time considered it a side job, and he did not think it would become a full-time career. He said it was a way to make some money on the side, while also keeping his part-time job at the music rental shop.

===Square (1986–2004)===
Uematsu joined Square in 1986, with his first work being a few tracks for &quot;Cruise Chaser Blassty&quot;. He met game designer Hironobu Sakaguchi shortly after, who asked him if he wanted to create music for some of his games, to which Uematsu agreed. For the next year, he created music for a number of games which did not achieve widespread success, such as &quot;King&#x27;s Knight&quot;, &quot;3-D WorldRunner&quot;, and &quot;Rad Racer&quot;. In 1987, Uematsu and Sakaguchi collaborated on what was originally to be Sakaguchi&#x27;s last contribution for Square, &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;. &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; popularity sparked Uematsu&#x27;s career in video game music, and he would go on to compose music for over 30 titles, most prominently the subsequent games in the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series. He scored the first installment in the &quot;SaGa&quot; series, &quot;The Final Fantasy Legend&quot;, in 1989. For the second game in the series, &quot;Final Fantasy Legend II&quot; he was assisted by Kenji Ito. In late 1994, Uematsu was asked to finish the soundtrack for &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; after Yasunori Mitsuda contracted peptic ulcers. In 1996, he co-composed the soundtrack to &quot;Front Mission: Gun Hazard&quot;, and created the entire score for &quot;Dynami Tracer&quot;. He also created music for three of the games in the &quot;Hanjuku Hero&quot; series.

Outside of video games, he has composed the main theme for the 2000 animated film &quot;Ah! My Goddess: The Movie&quot; and co-composed the 2001 anime &quot;Final Fantasy: Unlimited&quot; with Shirō Hamaguchi. He also inspired the &quot;Ten Plants&quot; concept albums, and released a solo album in 1994, titled &quot;Phantasmagoria&quot;. Feeling gradually more dissatisfied and uninspired, Uematsu requested the assistance of composers Masashi Hamauzu and Junya Nakano for the score to &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; in 2001. This marked the first time that Uematsu did not compose an entire main-series &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; soundtrack. For &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; from 2002, he was joined by Naoshi Mizuta, who composed the majority of the soundtrack, and Kumi Tanioka; Uematsu was responsible for only eleven tracks. In 2002, fellow Square colleagues Kenichiro Fukui and Tsuyoshi Sekito asked Uematsu to join them in forming a rock band that focused on reinterpreting and expanding on Uematsu&#x27;s compositions. He declined their offer at first because he was too busy with work; however, after agreeing to perform with Fukui and Sekito in a live performance as a keyboardist, he decided to join them in making a band. Another employee at Square, Mr. Matsushita, chose the name The Black Mages for their band. In 2003, Keiji Kawamori, Arata Hanyuda, and Michio Okamiya also joined the band. The Black Mages released three studio albums and performed at several concerts.

===Freelancer (2004–present)===
Uematsu left Square Enix in 2004 and formed his own production company, Smile Please. He later founded the music production company and record label Dog Ear Records in 2006. The reason for Uematsu&#x27;s departure was that the company moved their office from Meguro to Shinjuku, Tokyo and he was not comfortable with the new location. He also stated that he had reached an age where he should gradually take his life into his own hands. He does, however, continue to compose music as a freelancer for Square Enix. In 2005, Uematsu and several members of The Black Mages created the score for the CGI film &quot;Final Fantasy VII Advent Children&quot;. Uematsu composed only the main theme for &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot; (2006); he was originally offered the job of creating the full score, but Hitoshi Sakimoto was eventually assigned as the main composer instead. Uematsu was also initially going to create the theme song for &quot;Final Fantasy XIII&quot; (2010). However, after being assigned the task of creating the entire score of &quot;Final Fantasy XIV&quot;, Uematsu decided to hand the job over to Hamauzu.

Uematsu also works closely with Sakaguchi&#x27;s development studio Mistwalker, and has composed for &quot;Blue Dragon&quot; (2006), &quot;Lost Odyssey&quot; (2007), &quot;&quot; (2008); &quot;The Last Story&quot; (2011); and &quot;Terra Battle&quot; (2014). He also wrote music for the cancelled game &quot;Cry On&quot;. Uematsu created the main theme for &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot; in 2008. He then composed the music for the 2009 anime &quot;Guin Saga&quot;; this marked the first time he provided a full score for an animated series. Uematsu has contributed music and story to e-books, such as &quot;Blik-0 1946&quot;.

Uematsu appeared five times in the top 20 of the annual Classic FM Hall of Fame. In 2012, &quot;Aerith&#x27;s Theme&quot;, written by Uematsu for &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, was voted into the number 16 position in the annual Classic FM (UK) &quot;Hall of Fame&quot; top 300 chart. This was accompanied by &quot;Dancing Mad&quot; and &quot;To Zanarkand&quot;. It was the first time that a piece of music written for a video game had appeared in the chart. In 2013, music from the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series received even greater support and was voted into the third position on the Classic FM Hall of Fame. Uematsu and his &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; music subsequently appeared at number seven in 2014, number nine in 2015, and number 17 in 2016.

In September 2018, Uematsu announced that he would take a hiatus in order to recover from work fatigue, which led to him being hospitalized. He composed the main theme for 2020&#x27;s &quot;Final Fantasy VII Remake&quot;, &quot;Hollow&quot;. Sakaguchi said that Uematsu&#x27;s work on 2021&#x27;s &quot;Fantasian&quot; could be his last major game score due to health issues. In a video posted to the &quot;Fantasian&quot; Twitter account on October 15, 2024, Uematsu announced that this was his last project as a video game composer. This was later clarified on his Twitter account that he was not retiring from video game music entirely, but rather scaling back his involvement. He explained that while he would no longer take on full game soundtracks due to the time commitment, he would still be open to composing individual pieces, such as theme songs.

==Concerts==
Uematsu&#x27;s video game compositions have been performed in numerous concerts, and various &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; concerts have also been held. Outside Japan, Uematsu&#x27;s &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; music was performed live for the first time at the first event of the 2003 Symphonic Game Music Concert in Leipzig, Germany. Other events of the &quot;Symphonic Game Music Concerts&quot; featuring &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; music were held in 2004, 2006, and 2007. The concert in 2004 featured a world premiere of &quot;Those Who Fight&quot; from &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;. Japanese pianist Seiji Honda was invited to perform the arrangement together with the orchestra. Another world premiere was &quot;Dancing Mad&quot; from &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;, performed by orchestra, choir, and pipe organ. The event in 2007 included &quot;Distant Worlds&quot; from &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot;, performed by Japanese opera soprano Izumi Masuda.

A series of successful concert performances were held in Japan, including a &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; concert series titled Tour de Japon. The first stateside concert, Dear Friends – Music from Final Fantasy, took place on May 10, 2004, at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, California, and was performed by the Los Angeles Philharmonic orchestra and the Los Angeles Master Chorale. It was conducted by Fort Worth Symphony Orchestra director Miguel Harth-Bedoya. Due to a positive reception, a concert series for North America followed. On May 16, 2005, a follow-up concert called More Friends: Music from Final Fantasy was performed in Los Angeles at the Gibson Amphitheatre; the concert was conducted by Arnie Roth.

Uematsu&#x27;s &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; music was presented in the concert Voices – Music from Final Fantasy, which took place on February 18, 2006, at the Pacifico Yokohama convention center. Star guests included Emiko Shiratori, Rikki, Izumi Masuda, and Angela Aki. The concert focused on the songs from the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series and was conducted by Arnie Roth. Uematsu and several of his fellow composers were in attendance at the world premiere of Play! A Video Game Symphony in Chicago in May 2006; he composed the opening fanfare for the concert.

Uematsu&#x27;s first orchestral work written for the concert hall, Merregnon: Heart of Ice, premiered on February 29, 2024, in Ludwigshafen, Germany, performed by the Staatsphilharmonie Rheinland-Pfalz under Eckehard Stier.

==Works==


==Musical style and influences==
The style of Uematsu&#x27;s compositions is diverse, ranging from stately classical symphonic pieces and heavy metal to new-age and hyper-percussive techno-electronica. For example, in &quot;Lost Odyssey&quot;, the score ranges from classical orchestral arrangements to contemporary jazz and techno tracks. Uematsu has stated that he is a big fan of Celtic and Irish music, and some of his work contains elements from these musical styles. Uematsu&#x27;s &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; scores vary from upbeat, to dark and angry, to melancholic in nature. For instance, the music of &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot; is dark and gloomy, while the soundtrack to &quot;Final Fantasy IX&quot; is more carefree and upbeat. His &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; music has been described as being able to convey the true emotion of a scene; an example is &quot;Aerith&#x27;s Theme&quot; from &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;. In an interview with the &quot;Nichi Bei Times&quot;, Uematsu said &quot;I don&#x27;t really self-consciously compose music for Japan or for the world, but I do think there is something in my more melancholy pieces that has a distinctly Japanese quality.&quot; He has been named one of the &quot;Innovators&quot; in &quot;Time&quot; &quot;Time 100: The Next Wave — Music&quot; feature. He has also been called the &quot;John Williams of the video game world&quot; and been credited for &quot;increasing the appreciation and awareness&quot; of video game music.

Many of Uematsu&#x27;s musical influences come from the United Kingdom and the United States. He cites Elton John as his biggest musical influence, and he has stated that he wanted to be like him. Other major inspirations include the Beatles, Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, Simon &amp; Garfunkel, and progressive rock bands. In the classical genre, he cites Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky as a great influence. Uematsu has said that 1970s bands, such as Pink Floyd and King Crimson, influenced his &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; compositions. The lyrics for the piece &quot;One-Winged Angel&quot; from &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; were taken from the medieval poetry on which Carl Orff based his cantata &quot;Carmina Burana&quot;, specifically the songs &quot;Estuans Interius&quot;, &quot;O Fortuna&quot;, &quot;Veni, Veni, Venias&quot; and &quot;Ave Formosissima&quot;. In turn, Uematsu has had a major influence on video game music and beyond the video game industry as well. For example, &quot;Liberi Fatali&quot; from &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot; was played during the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens during the women&#x27;s synchronized swimming event. From the same game, &quot;Eyes on Me&quot;, featuring Chinese pop singer Faye Wong, sold a record 400,000 copies and was the first song from a video game to win an award at the Japan Gold Disc Awards, where it won &quot;Song of the Year (International)&quot; in 2000. Uematsu said that he gets more inspiration from walking his dog than from listening to other music.

==Personal life==
Uematsu resides in Tokyo with his wife, Reiko, whom he met during college. They have a summer cabin in Yamanakako, Yamanashi. In his spare time, he enjoys watching professional wrestling, drinking beer, and bicycling. Uematsu has said he originally wanted to become a professional wrestler, mentioning it was a career dream when he was younger.

<text>The culture of the Netherlands is diverse, reflecting regional differences as well as the foreign influences built up by centuries of the Dutch people&#x27;s mercantile and explorative spirit. The Netherlands and its people have long played an important role as centre of cultural liberalism and tolerance. The Dutch Golden Age is popularly regarded as its zenith.

==Language==
The official language of the Netherlands is Dutch, spoken by almost all people in the Netherlands. Dutch is also spoken and official in Aruba, Brussels, Curaçao, Flanders, Sint Maarten and Suriname. It is a West Germanic, Low Franconian language that originated in the Early Middle Ages (c. 470) and was standardized in the 16th century. Frisian is also a recognized language and it is used by the government in the province of Friesland. Several dialects of Low Saxon (&quot;Nedersaksisch&quot; in Dutch) are spoken in much of the north and east and are recognized by the Netherlands as regional languages according to the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. Another Dutch dialect granted the status of regional language is Limburgish, which is spoken in the south-eastern province of Limburg. However, both Dutch Low Saxon and Limburgish spread across the Dutch-German border and belong to a common Dutch-Low German dialect continuum.

There is a tradition of learning foreign languages in the Netherlands: about 89% of the total population have a good knowledge of English, 70% of German, 29% of French and 5% of Spanish.

==Religion==

Between the Celtic and Germanic peoples and later the Roman conquerors a cultural exchange took place. An adaptation of polytheistic religions and each other&#x27;s myths took place among the various tribes, coming from the Germanic, Celtic and later Roman mythology. From the 4th to the 6th century AD The Great Migration took place, in which the small Celtic-Germanic-Roman tribes in the Low Countries were gradually supplanted by three major Germanic tribes: the Franks, the Frisians and the Saxons. Around 500 the Franks, initially residing between the Rhine and the Somme embraced Christianity under the auspices of King Clovis I. However, it would take at least until AD 1000 before all the pagans were actually Christianized and the Frisian and Saxon religions became extinct, although elements were incorporated into the local Christian religion. The following centuries Catholic Christianity was the only mainstream religion in the Netherlands. The rebellious Netherlands that had united in the Union of Utrecht (1579) declared their independence from Spain in 1581, during the Eighty Years&#x27; War; Spain finally accepted this in 1648. The Dutch revolt was partially religiously motivated: during the Reformation many of the Dutch had adopted Lutheran, Anabaptist, Calvinist or Mennonite forms of Protestantism. These religious movements were suppressed by the Spanish, who supported the Counter Reformation. After independence the Netherlands adopted Calvinism as a quasi-state religion (although never formally), but practiced a degree of religious tolerance towards non-Calvinists.

Until late into the 20th century, the predominant religion in the Netherlands was Christianity. Although religious diversity remains, there has been a decline in religious adherence. In 2006, 34% of the Dutch population identified as Christian, decreasing till in 2015 almost 25% of the population adhered to one of the Christian faiths (11.7% Roman Catholic, 8.6% PKN, 4.2% other small Christian denominations), 5% is Muslim and 2% adheres to Hinduism or Buddhism, based on independent in-depth interviewing by Radboud University and Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. Approximately 67.8% of the population in 2015 has no religious affiliation, up from 61% in 2006, 53% in 1996, 43% 1979 and 33% in 1966. The Sociaal en Cultureel Planbureau (Social and Cultural Planning Agency, SCP) expects the number of non-affiliated Dutch to be at 72% in 2020.

A large majority of the Dutch population believes that religion should not have a determining role to play in politics and education. Religion is also decreasingly seen as a social binder, and is generally considered a personal matter which should not be propagated in public. The Dutch constitution guarantees freedom of education, which means that all schools that adhere to general quality criteria receive the same government funding. This includes schools based on religious principles by religious groups (especially Roman Catholic and various Protestant). Three political parties in the Dutch parliament, (CDA, and two small parties, ChristianUnion and SGP) are based upon the Christian belief. Several Christian religious holidays are national holidays (Christmas, Easter, Pentecost and the Ascension of Jesus). In the late 19th century atheism began to rise as secularism, liberalism and socialism grew; in the 1960s and 1970s Protestantism and Catholicism notably began to decline. There is one major exception: Islam, which grew considerably as the result of immigration. Since the year 2000, there has been raised awareness of religion, mainly due to Muslim extremism. Islam is not part of the Dutch identity, culture or tradition. In 2013 a Catholic became Queen consort.

From a December 2014 survey by the VU University Amsterdam it was concluded that for the first time there are more atheists (25%) than theists (17%) in the Netherlands. The majority of the population being agnostic (31%) or ietsists (27%). Atheism, agnosticism and Christian atheism are on the rise and are widely accepted and considered to be non-controversial. Among those who adhere to Christianity, there are high percentages of atheists, agnostics and ietsism, since affiliation with a Christian denomination is also used in a way of cultural identification in the different parts of the Netherlands. In 2015, a vast majority of the inhabitants of the Netherlands (82%) said they had never or almost never visited a church, and 59% stated that they had never been to a church of any kind. Of all the people questioned, 24% saw themselves as atheist, which is an increase of 11% compared to the previous study done in 2006. The expected rise of spirituality (ietsism) has come to a halt according to research in 2015. In 2006 40% of respondents considered themselves spiritual, in 2015 this has dropped to 31%. The number who believed in the existence of a higher power fell from 36% to 28% over the same period.

Christianity is currently the largest religion in the Netherlands. The provinces of North Brabant and Limburg have historically been strongly Roman Catholic, and some of their people might still consider the Catholic Church as a base for their cultural identity. Protestantism in the Netherlands consists of a number of churches within various traditions. The largest of these is the Protestant Church in the Netherlands (PKN), a United church which is Reformed and Lutheran in orientation. It was formed in 2004 as a merger of the Dutch Reformed Church, the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands and a smaller Lutheran Church. Several orthodox Reformed and liberal churches did not merge into the PKN. Although in the Netherlands as a whole Christianity has become a minority, the Netherlands contains a Bible Belt from Zeeland to the northern parts of the province Overijssel, in which Protestant (particularly Reformed) beliefs remain strong, and even has majorities in municipal councils.

Islam is the second-largest religion in the state. In 2012, there were about 825,000 Muslims in the Netherlands (5% of the population). Muslim numbers increased from the 1960s as a consequence of large numbers of migrant workers. These included migrants from former Dutch colonies, such as Surinam and Indonesia, but mainly migrant workers from Turkey and Morocco. During the 1990s, Muslim refugees arrived from countries like Bosnia and Herzegovina, Iran, Iraq, Somalia, and Afghanistan.

Other religions account for some 6% of the Dutch people. Hinduism is a minority religion in the Netherlands, with around 215,000 adherents (slightly over 1% of the population). Most of these are Indo-Surinamese. There are also sizable populations of Hindu immigrants from India and Sri Lanka, and some Western adherents of Hinduism-oriented new religious movements such as Hare Krishnas. The Netherlands has an estimated 250,000 Buddhists or people strongly attracted to this religion, mainly ethnic Dutch people. There are about 45,000 Jews in the Netherlands.

==Art and media==

=== Art ===
Dutch Golden Age painting was among the most acclaimed in the world at the time, during the 17th century. There was an enormous output of painting, so much so that prices declined seriously during the period. From the 1620s, Dutch painting broke decisively from the Baroque style typified by Rubens in neighbouring Flanders into a more realistic style of depiction, very much concerned with the real world. Types of paintings included historical paintings, portraiture, landscapes and cityscapes, still lifes and genre paintings. In the last four of these categories, Dutch painters established styles upon which art in Europe depended for the next two centuries. Paintings often had a moralistic subtext. The Golden Age never really recovered from the French invasion of 1672, although there was a twilight period lasting until about 1710.

Dutch painters, especially in the northern provinces, tried to evoke emotions in the spectator by letting him/her be a bystander to a scene of profound intimacy. Portrait painting thrived in the Netherlands in the 17th century. A great many portraits were commissioned by wealthy individuals. Group portraits similarly were often ordered by prominent members of a city&#x27;s civilian guard, by boards of trustees and regents, and the like. Often group portraits were paid for by each portrayed person individually. The key example to this is The Night Watch by Rembrandt. The amount paid determined each person&#x27;s place in the picture, either head to toe in full regalia in the foreground or face only in the back of the group. Sometimes all group members paid an equal sum, which was likely to lead to quarrels when some members gained a more prominent place in the picture than others. Allegories, in which painted objects conveyed symbolic meaning about the subject, were often applied. Many genre paintings, which seemingly only depicted everyday life, actually illustrated Dutch proverbs and sayings, or conveyed a moralistic message, the meaning of which is not always easy to decipher nowadays. Favourite topics in Dutch landscapes were the dunes along the western seacoast, rivers with their broad adjoining meadows where cattle grazed, often a silhouette of a city in the distance.
The Hague School were around at the start of the 19th century. They showed all that is gravest or brightest in the landscape of Holland, all that is heaviest or clearest in its atmosphere. Amsterdam Impressionism was current during the middle of the Nineteenth century at about the same time as French Impressionism. The painters put their impressions onto canvas with rapid, visible strokes of the brush. They focused on depicting the everyday life of the city. Late nineteenth-century Amsterdam was a bustling centre of art and literature. Vincent van Gogh was a post-Impressionist painter whose work, notable for its rough beauty, emotional honesty and bold color, had a far-reaching influence on 20th-century art. In the 20th century, the Netherlands produced many fine painters and artists including (but not limited to): Roelof Frankot, Salomon Garf, Pyke Koch and many more. Around 1905-1910 pointillism was flourishing. Between 1911 and 1914 all the latest art movements arrived in the Netherlands one after another including cubism, futurism and expressionism. After World War I, De Stijl (&quot;the style&quot;) was led by Piet Mondrian and promoted a pure art, consisting only of vertical and horizontal lines, and the use of primary colours.

===Architecture===


The Dutch Golden Age roughly spanned the 17th century. Due to the thriving economy, cities expanded greatly. New town halls and storehouses were built, and many new canals were dug out in and around various cities such as Delft, Leiden and Amsterdam for defence and transport purposes. Many wealthy merchants had a new house built along these canals. These houses were generally very narrow and had ornamented façades that befitted their new status. The reason they were narrow was because a house was taxed on the width of the façade. The architecture of the first republic in Northern Europe was marked by sobriety and restraint, and was meant to reflect democratic values by quoting extensively from classical antiquity. In general, architecture in the Low Countries, both in the Counter-Reformation-influenced south and Protestant-dominated north, remained strongly invested in northern Italian Renaissance and Mannerist forms that predated the Roman High Baroque style of Borromini and Bernini. Instead, the more austere form practiced in the Dutch Republic was well suited to major building patterns: palaces for the House of Orange and new civic buildings, uninfluenced by the Counter-Reformation style that made some headway in Antwerp. At the end of the 19th century there was a remarkable neo-Gothic stream or Gothic Revival both in church and in public architecture, notably by the Roman Catholic Pierre Cuypers, who was inspired by the Frenchman Viollet le Duc. The Amsterdam Rijksmuseum (1876–1885) and Amsterdam Centraal Station (1881–1889) belong to his main buildings.
During the 20th century Dutch architects played a leading role in the development of modern architecture. Out of the early 20th century rationalist architecture of Berlage, architect of the Beurs van Berlage, three separate groups developed during the 1920s, each with their own view on which direction modern architecture should take. Expressionist architects like M. de Klerk and P.J. Kramer in Amsterdam (&quot;See Amsterdam School&quot;). Functionalist architects (&quot;Nieuwe Zakelijkheid&quot; or &quot;Nieuwe Bouwen&quot;) like Mart Stam, L. C. van der Vlugt, Willem Marinus Dudok and Johannes Duiker had good ties with the international modernist group CIAM. A third group came out of the De Stijl movement, among them J. J. P. Oud and Gerrit Rietveld. Both architects later built in a functionalist style. During the 1950s and 1960s a new generation of architects like Aldo van Eyck, J.B. Bakema and Herman Hertzberger, known as the ‘Forum generation’ (named after a magazine titled &quot;Forum&quot;) formed a connection with international groups like Team 10. From the &#x27;80s to the present Rem Koolhaas and his Office for Metropolitan Architecture (OMA) became one of the leading world architects. With him, formed a new generation of Dutch architects working in a modernist tradition.

===Comic strips===

The Dutch have a distinct comic book tradition as well. Although there is an abundance of Flemish, Franco-Belgian, and US comics, they also created their own. Examples are Secret agent 327 and Storm, written by Martin Lodewijk and Jack, Jacky and the Juniors by Jan Kruis, as well as cartoons with a more literary style, like Viking series &quot;Eric de Noorman&quot; by Hans G. Kresse and &quot;Tom Poes &amp; Heer Bommel&quot; (Tom Puss/Oliver B. Bumble) created by Marten Toonder. The nations love of football also translated into comics, like Roel Dijkstra and &quot;F.C. Knudde&quot;.

Children&#x27;s comic book series Miffy (Dutch: &quot;Nijntje&quot;) by Dick Bruna has been published in over 50 languages, and predates the similarly drawn Hello Kitty by over ten years.

===Music and dance===

The Netherlands has diverse musical traditions, ranging from folk and dance to classical music and ballet. Traditional Dutch music is a genre known as levenslied, meaning &#x27;song of life&#x27;, to an extent comparable to French chanson or German schlager. These songs typically have a simple melody and rhythm, and a straightforward structure of couplets and refrains. Themes can be light, but are often sentimental and include love, death and loneliness. Traditional musical instruments such as the accordion and the barrel organ are a staple of levenslied music, though in recent years, many artists also use synthesizers and guitars. Artists in this genre include Jan Smit, Frans Bauer and the late André Hazes.

More than most other non-English speaking European countries, the Netherlands has remained closely in tune with US and British trends since the 1950s. Contemporary Dutch rock and pop music (Nederpop) originated in the 1960s, heavily influenced by popular music from the USA and Britain. In the 1960s and 1970s, the lyrics were mostly in English, and some tracks were instrumental. Bands such as Shocking Blue, (the) Golden Earring and Focus enjoyed international success. As of the 1980s, more and more pop musicians started working in the Dutch language, partly inspired by the huge success of the band Doe Maar. Today, Dutch rock and pop music thrives in both languages, with some artists recording in both. Current symphonic metal bands Epica and Within Temptation, as well as jazz/pop singer Caro Emerald are having some international success. Contemporary local icons include rock singer Anouk, country pop singer Ilse DeLange, rock band Kane and Dutch-language duo Nick &amp; Simon.

Early 1990s Dutch and Belgian house music came together in Eurodance project 2 Unlimited. Selling 18 million records, the two singers in the band are the most successful Dutch music artists to this day. Tracks like &quot;Get Ready for This&quot; are still popular themes of U.S. sports events, like the NHL. In the mid 1990s Dutch language rap and hip hop (&quot;Nederhop&quot;) also came to maturation and has become popular in the Netherlands and Belgium. In the 21st century, artists with North African, Caribbean and Middle Eastern origins have profoundly influenced this genre.

Since the 1990s, Dutch electronic dance music (EDM) has conquered the world in many forms, from trance, techno and gabber to hardstyle. Some of the world&#x27;s best dance music DJs hail from the Netherlands, including Armin van Buuren, Tiësto, Hardwell, Martin Garrix and Afrojack; the first four of which have been ranked as best in the world by DJ Mag Top 100 DJs. The Amsterdam dance event (ADE) is the world&#x27;s leading electronic music conference and the biggest club festival for the many electronic subgenres on the planet. These artists also contribute significantly to the mainstream pop music played over the airwaves all around the world, as they frequently collaborate and produce for many notable artists.

In classical music, Jan Sweelinck ranks as the Netherlands&#x27; most famous composer, with Louis Andriessen amongst the best-known living Dutch classical composers. Celebrated Dutch conductors, past and present, include Willem Mengelberg, Eduard van Beinum, Bernard Haitink, Jac van Steen and Jaap van Zweden. Notable violinists are Janine Jansen and André Rieu. The latter, together with his Johann Strauss Orchestra, has taken classical and waltz music on worldwide concert tours, the size and revenue of which are otherwise only seen from the world&#x27;s biggest rock and pop music acts. Acclaimed harpist Lavinia Meijer in 2012 released an album of works by Philip Glass that she transcribed for harp, with the approval of the composer. The Concertgebouw (completed in 1888) in Amsterdam is home to the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, considered one of the world&#x27;s finest orchestras and on occasion voted the best of all.

Aruba and the five main islands of the Netherlands Antilles are part of the Lesser Antilles island chain. Their music is a mixture of native, African and Dutch elements, and is closely connected with trends from neighbouring islands like Barbados, Martinique, Trinidad and Tobago and Guadeloupe, as well as the mainland former Dutch possession of Suriname, which has exported kaseko music to great success on the islands. Curaçao and Bonaire likely have the most active and well-known music scenes. Curaçao is known for a kind of music called tumba, which is named after the conga drums that accompany it.

===Cabaret===
The Dutch also have their own distinct version of cabaret, with overarching themes and aimed at provoking thought, and sometimes sentiment, as well as laughs. This is exemplified in performers such as Wim Kan and Toon Hermans in the 1960s and 1970s and later diversified into a rich culture with artists such as Youp van &#x27;t Hek, Freek de Jonge, Herman van Veen, Theo Maassen, Claudia de Breij, Dolf Jansen, Brigitte Kaandorp, Hans Teeuwen and Herman Finkers.

===Film===

Some Dutch films – mainly by director Paul Verhoeven – have received international distribution and recognition, such as &quot;Turkish Delight&quot; (&quot;&quot;Turks Fruit&quot;) (1973), &quot;Soldier of Orange&quot; (&quot;Soldaat van Oranje&quot;) (1975), &quot;Spetters&quot; (1980) and &quot;The Fourth Man&quot; (&quot;De Vierde Man&quot;&quot;) (1983). Verhoeven then went on to direct big Hollywood films like &quot;RoboCop&quot; and &quot;Basic Instinct&quot;, and returned with Dutch film &quot;Black Book&quot; in 2006.

Other well-known Dutch film directors are Jan de Bont (&quot;Speed&quot;), Dick Maas (&quot;De Lift&quot;), Fons Rademakers (&quot;The Assault&quot;), documentary maker Bert Haanstra and Joris Ivens. Film director Theo van Gogh achieved international notoriety in 2004 when he was murdered in the streets of Amsterdam.

Internationally successful Dutch actors include Famke Janssen (X-Men films), Carice van Houten (&quot;Game of Thrones&quot;), Rutger Hauer (&quot;Blade Runner&quot;), Jeroen Krabbé and Derek de Lint.

===Radio and television===
The Netherlands has a well-developed radio and television market, with both multiple commercial and non-commercial broadcasters. Imported TV programmes, as well as interviews with responses in a foreign language, are virtually always shown with the original sound, and subtitled. The only exception are shows for children.

TV exports from the Netherlands mostly take the form of specific formats and franchises, most notably through internationally active TV production conglomerate Endemol, founded by Dutch media tycoons John de Mol and Joop van den Ende. Headquartered in Amsterdam, Endemol has around 90 companies in over 30 countries. Endemol and its subsidiaries create and run reality, talent, and game show franchises worldwide, including &quot;Big Brother, Deal or No Deal, 1 vs. 100 and The Voice.&quot;

Two of the biggest annual Dutch radio events are 3FM Serious Request and the Top 2000 — both multi-day round-the-clock national broadcasting events in the month of December, supported by other media. They both have over half of the population of the Netherlands listening to the broadcasts each year.

Serious Request is a Red Cross fundraiser, held the week before Christmas on pop music station 3FM, and has grown to become an international franchise adopted by eight other countries.

The &quot;Top 2000&quot; is an integral broadcast of the 2,000 most popular songs of all time on station Radio 2 from noon 25 December Christmas Day through midnight of New Year&#x27;s Eve.

==Lifestyle==
===Spatial management===
The Netherlands is densely populated and just under one-third of its territory lies below sea level and has to be defended from nature. This has led to a rational and collective approach to spatial planning, and particularly to water management.

In urban planning, this is seen in:
* the retention in some cities of the public ownership of most land through the ground rent (&quot;erfpacht&quot;) system, which facilitates comprehensive development and socialises increases in land prices;
* the widespread provision of social housing through housing associations, mixed with private ownership;
* rational mobility, including a dense railway network and, since the 1970s, the world&#x27;s best cycling infrastructure. Almost everybody cycles as a matter of course, and cycling has a modal share of 27% of all trips (urban and rural) nationwide.

The Dutch also minimise ostentatious displays of status and wealth difference, and have a low power distance. They accept the need to follow rules, but combine this with tolerance of difference and respect for privacy.

As the country&#x27;s watery geography dictates, the Netherlands has a strong nautical culture.

===Traditions===
A prime traditional festivity in the Netherlands is Sint Nicolaas or &quot;Sinterklaas&quot;. It is celebrated on the evening before Sinterklaas&#x27; birthday on 5 December, especially in families with little children. Sinterklaas has a companion known as Zwarte Piet, which in recent years has come under scrutiny in light of accusations of racist caricatures. In the United States the original figure of Dutch &quot;Sinterklaas&quot; has merged with &quot;Father Christmas&quot; into Santa Claus. In the Netherlands, gift-bringing at Christmas has in recent decades gained some popularity too, although Sinterklaas is much more popular..

The national holiday is celebrated on 27 April with King&#x27;s Day (&quot;Koningsdag&quot;) in honour of the King&#x27;s birthday. The day is moved up to Saturday if it would otherwise happen on a Sunday. The day is known for its nationwide &quot;vrijmarkt&quot; (&quot;free market&quot;), at which many Dutch sell their secondhand items. It is also an opportunity for &quot;orange madness&quot; or &quot;oranjegekte&quot;, for the national colour, when the normally strait-laced Dutch let down their hair, often dyed orange for the occasion.

World Animal Day has been observed since 1929, primarily by the children of the Netherlands. It is as well known as Mother&#x27;s and Father&#x27;s Day.
A widespread tradition is that of serving &quot;beschuit met muisjes&quot; when people come to visit a new-born baby and its mother. &quot;Beschuit&quot; is a typical Dutch type of biscuit, &quot;muisjes&quot; are sugared anise seeds. Blue &quot;muisjes&quot; are used for a baby boy, and pink &quot;muisjes&quot; are used for a baby girl.

More regional traditions include the huge Easter Fires or celebrating Sint Maarten on the evening of 11 November when children go door to door with paper lanterns and candles, and sing songs in return for a treat. This holiday is celebrated in some parts of Groningen, North Holland and the southern and middle part of Limburg and to a lesser extent in South Holland and Zeeland. This celebration marks the beginning of the dark period before Christmas and the long days of winter. The same thing happens on 6 January with Epiphany in some areas in the Catholic south of the Netherlands. In the past, home-made lanterns were used, made from a hollowed out sugar beet. In North Brabant, Limburg and some other parts of the Netherlands people celebrate Carnaval similar to the carnival of the German Rhineland and Belgium Flanders.

===Cuisine===
Dutch cuisine is characterized by its somewhat limited diversity; however, it varies greatly from region to region. The southern regions of the Netherlands, for example, share dishes with Flanders and vice versa. The Southern Dutch cuisine is the only Dutch culinary region which developed an haute cuisine, as it is influenced by both German cuisine and French cuisine, and it forms the base of most traditional Dutch restaurants. Dutch food is traditionally characterized by the high consumption of vegetables when compared to the consumption of meat. Dairy products are also eaten to great extent, Dutch cheeses are world-renowned with famous cheeses such as Gouda, Edam and Leiden. Dutch pastry is extremely rich and is eaten in great quantities. When it comes to alcoholic beverages wine has long been absent in Dutch cuisine (but this is changing during the last decades); traditionally there are many brands of beer and strong alcoholic spirits such as jenever and brandewijn.
The Dutch have all sorts of pastry and cookies (the word &quot;cookie&quot; is in fact derived from Dutch), many of them filled with marzipan, almond and chocolate. A truly huge amount of different pies and cakes can be found, most notably in the southern provinces, especially the so-called Limburgish &quot;vlaai&quot;.

===Sports===

Football is the most popular sport in the Netherlands. Notable Dutch football teams and clubs include: Amsterdamsche Football club Ajax in 1900, Feyenoord Rotterdam in 1908 and PSV Eindhoven in 1913.

Another almost national sport is speedskating. It is common for Northern Dutch children to learn how to skate at an early age. Long distance skating and all-round tournaments are the most popular and most successful areas for the Dutch. In the history of the world championships the champion of the 10 km has always been a Dutchman. Notable athletes are Sven Kramer, Rintje Ritsma and Ard Schenk.

Also popular are swimming, field hockey, judo and cycling. 

A typical Dutch sport is &quot;korfball&quot;, a mixed sport played by girls and boys. It&#x27;s invented in the Netherlands, but now it&#x27;s also played in countries such as Belgium, Germany and Japan. At the IKF Korfball World Championship the Dutch team has won in all cases except once.

<text>Project Pluto was a United States government program to develop nuclear-powered ramjet engines for use in cruise missiles. Two experimental engines were tested at the Nevada Test Site (NTS) in 1961 and 1964 respectively.

On 1 January 1957, the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission selected the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory to study the feasibility of applying heat from a nuclear reactor to power a ramjet engine for a Supersonic Low Altitude Missile. This would have many advantages over other contemporary nuclear weapons delivery systems: operating at Mach 3, or around , and flying as low as , it would be invulnerable to interception by contemporary air defenses, carry more nuclear warheads with greater nuclear weapon yield, deliver them with greater accuracy than was possible with intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBMs) at the time and, unlike them, could be recalled.

This research became known as Project Pluto, and was directed by Theodore Charles (Ted) Merkle, leader of the laboratory&#x27;s R Division. Originally carried out at Livermore, California, testing was moved to new facilities constructed for $1.2 million (equivalent to $ million in ) on at NTS Site 401, also known as Jackass Flats. The test reactors were moved about on a railroad car that could be controlled remotely. The need to maintain supersonic speed at low altitude and in all kinds of weather meant that the reactor had to survive high temperatures and intense radiation. Ceramic nuclear fuel elements were used that contained highly enriched uranium oxide fuel and beryllium oxide neutron moderator.

After a series of preliminary tests to verify the integrity of the components under conditions of strain and vibration, Tory II-A, the world&#x27;s first nuclear ramjet engine, was run at full power (46 MW) on 14 May 1961. A larger, fully-functional ramjet engine was then developed called Tory II-C. This was run at full power (461 MW) on 20 May 1964, thereby demonstrating the feasibility of a nuclear-powered ramjet engine. Despite these and other successful tests, ICBM technology developed quicker than expected, and this reduced the need for cruise missiles. By the early 1960s, there was greater sensitivity about the dangers of radioactive emissions in the atmosphere, and devising an appropriate test plan for the necessary flight tests was difficult. On 1 July 1964, seven years and six months after it was started, Project Pluto was canceled.

==Origins==
During the 1950s, the United States Air Force (USAF) considered the use of nuclear powered aircraft and missiles as part of its Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion project, which was coordinated by the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion Office. Research into missiles was coordinated by its Missile Projects Branch. The concept of using a nuclear reactor to provide a heat source for a ramjet was explored by Frank E. Rom and Eldon W. Sams at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics Lewis Research Center in 1954 and 1955. The principle behind the nuclear ramjet was relatively simple: motion of the vehicle pushed air in through the front of the vehicle (the ram effect). If a nuclear reactor heated the air, the hot air expanded at high speed out through a nozzle at the back, providing thrust.

At the time, the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) was conducting studies of the use of a nuclear rocket as an upper stage of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) on behalf of the USAF. The AEC farmed this work out to its two rival atomic weapons laboratories, the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory (LASL) in Los Alamos, New Mexico, and the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory at Livermore, California. By late 1956 improvements in nuclear weapon design had reduced the need for a nuclear upper stage, and the development effort was concentrated at LASL, where it became known as Project Rover.

On 1 January 1957, the USAF and the AEC selected the Livermore Laboratory to study the design of a nuclear reactor to power ramjet engines. This research became known as Project Pluto. It was directed by Theodore C. (Ted) Merkle, leader of the Laboratory&#x27;s R Division.

== Development ==

The proposed use for nuclear-powered ramjets would be to power a cruise missile, called SLAM, for Supersonic Low Altitude Missile. It would have many advantages over other nuclear weapons delivery systems. It was estimated that the reactor would weigh between , permitting a payload of over . Operating at Mach 3, or around and flying as low as , it would be invulnerable to interception by contemporary air defenses. It could carry more nuclear warheads than the sixteen aboard a Polaris ballistic missile submarine, they could be larger, with nuclear weapon yields of up to , and delivered with greater accuracy. Moreover, unlike an ICBM, it could be recalled.

It was estimated that the unit cost of each missile would be less than $5 million (equivalent to $ million in ), making them much cheaper than a Boeing B-52 Stratofortress bomber. Operating costs would also be low, as keeping them in readiness would be cheaper than a submarine or bomber, and comparable with a missile silo-based ICBM. Range would not be unlimited, but would be determined by the fuel load. Merkle calculated that a MW-day of energy would burn about one gram of highly enriched uranium. A 490 MW reactor with 50 kilograms of uranium would therefore burn 1 percent of its fuel each day. Assuming that an accumulation of neutron poisons could be avoided, the missile could fly for several days. The success of the project depended upon a series of technological advances in metallurgy and materials science. Pneumatic motors necessary to control the reactor in flight had to operate while red-hot and in the presence of intense ionizing radiation. The need to maintain supersonic speed at low altitude and in all kinds of weather meant that the missile would have to fly though much denser air. In turn, this meant that it would encounter much greater air resistance and have to generate more power to overcome it. The reactor, code-named &quot;Tory&quot;, would therefore have to survive high temperatures that would melt the metals used in most jet and rocket engines. 
The solution arrived at was to use ceramic fuel elements. The core of the reactor would be made of beryllium oxide (), the only available neutron moderator material that could withstand the high temperatures required. Over 80 percent of the fueled tubes were long; the rest varied in length so as to achieve the correct column length and arrangement. The tubes consisted of a BeO matrix with a grain size between in diameter containing a solid solution of urania (), zirconia () and yttria (). The Tory II-A reactor used a uranium-beryllia mixture, but by the time Tory II-C was built zirconia and yttria was added in a 1.06:1:1 ratio of urania:zirconia:yttria. The zirconia and yttria stabilized the urania against phase transition to triuranium octoxide () at temperatures around . The fuel particles of the urania-zirconia-yttria mixture (known as &quot;horseradish&quot;) were mostly from in size, although some were smaller or larger. The uranium was in the form of oralloy: uranium enriched to 93.2 percent uranium-235.

The tubes had a hexagonal cross-section measuring from one flat side to the opposite, with a 7.5-millimeter diameter hole in the center. They were closely packed to form a honeycomb pattern. The metal tie rods were made of René 41 and Hastelloy R235 and were cooled so they did not exceed . The ceramic tubes surrounding the tie rods (known as guard tubes) were unfueled and had smaller diameter holes. The core was surrounded by neutron reflectors on all sides.The forward reflector was thick and the aft reflector thick. Both were composed of BeO tubes. The side reflector consisted of of BeO tubes around which was of nickel shims. The reactor was controlled through the movement of hafnium control rods that moved axially within the tie rods. Twelve of the rods, known as shim rods, were located about from the central axis of the core, while two were located closer to the reflector; one was a vernier rod and the other as a safety rod. Normally the movement of the rods was restricted to but in the event of a scram they could be moved in 1.5 seconds. The shim rods were moved by four actuators, each of which handled three shim rods. The shim rods were long and in diameter, with a travel.

The contract to manufacture the fuel elements was awarded to the Coors Porcelain Company. The process of making horseradish involved mixing BeO powder with oralloy uranyl nitrate, yttrium nitrate and zirconium nitrate to form a slurry which was coprecipitated by adding ammonium nitrate. Because the process involved oralloy, criticality safety required a long, narrow geometry for the mix tanks. The mixture was filtered, dried and calcined at . It was then blended with a binding mixture containing polyvinyl alcohol, methyl cellulose and water and extruded through a die at to form the tubes. The tubes were dried, the binder was burned out by heating to , and they were fired in hydrogen at to densify them. The maximum permissible effect on reactivity due to impurities in the tubes was 2 to 3 percent. In practice it was only 0.5 percent.

== Test facilities ==
Tests were conducted at new facilities constructed for $1.2 million (equivalent to $ million in ) on of Jackass Flats at the AEC&#x27;s Nevada Test Site (NTS), known as Site 401. The facilities there were shared with Project Rover. The complex included of roads, critical-assembly building, control building, assembly and shop buildings, and utilities.
An aggregate mine was purchased to supply the concrete for the walls of the disassembly building, Building 2201, which were thick. Building 2201 was designed to allow radioactive components to be adjusted, dissembled or replaced remotely. Operations in the main disassembly bay could be viewed through lead glass viewing windows. &quot;Hot&quot; cells adjacent to the disassembly bay were used to monitor the control rod actuators. Vaults within each cell were equipped with remote manipulators.

All controls were located in the central control room, which was air conditioned with a positive pressure so air always flowed towards the disassembly bay and the hot cells, and the used air from them was passed through filters. The main disassembly bay and the hot cells were accessible through openings that were normally covered with lead plates. There were showers and a radiation safety room for workers. Building 2201 also contained a maintenance shop, darkroom, offices, and equipment storage rooms. Scientists monitored the tests remotely via a television hook up from a tin shed located at a safe distance that had a fallout shelter stocked with two weeks&#x27; supply of food and water in the event of a major catastrophe.

Some of oil well casing was necessary to store the approximately of compressed air at used to simulate ramjet flight conditions for Pluto. Three giant compressors were borrowed from the Naval Submarine Base New London in Groton, Connecticut that could replenish the farm in five days. A five-minute, full-power test involved of air being forced over 14 million diameter steel balls that were held in four steel tanks which were heated to .

Because the test reactors were highly radioactive once they were started, they were transported to and from the test site on railroad cars. The &quot;Jackass and Western Railroad&quot;, as it was light-heartedly described, was said to be the world&#x27;s shortest and slowest railroad. There were two locomotives, the remotely controlled electric L-1, and the diesel/electric L-2, which was manually controlled but had radiation shielding around the cab. The former was normally used; the latter was as a backup. The Cold Assembly Bay (Room 101) in Building 2201 was used for storage and assembly of components of the reactor test vehicle. It also contained a maintenance service pit and battery charger for the locomotives.

== Tory II-A==
In 1957, the Livermore Laboratory began working on a prototype reactor called Tory II-A to test the proposed design. It was initially intended to build two Tory II-A test reactors, which were designated IIA-1 and IIA-2; ultimately only one was built. Its purpose was to test the design under conditions similar to that in a ramjet engine. To save time, money, and reduce its complexity, Tory II-A had a diameter about a third of that required for the engine, a much smaller diameter than the final design. To allow it to still reach criticality with reduced fuel, the core was surrounded by a thick nuclear graphite neutron reflector.

The Tory II-A design process was completed by early 1960. During the summer and early fall of that year, the core was assembled at Livermore inside a special fixture in a shielded containment building. It reached criticality on 7 October with the control vanes rotated 90° from the full shutdown position. A test was then carried out with the cooling passages of the core and neutron reflector filled with water. Instead of the predicted increase in reactivity, there was a drop, and the reactor could not go critical at all. The water was replaced with heavy water, but it was barely able to reach criticality. It was therefore concluded that additional fuel would be required to attain the required margin for error when more components were installed.
The reactor was shipped to the Nevada Test Site for a series of dry runs and zero- or low-power tests. Another layer of fuel elements was added. The reactor was mounted on the test vehicle and, with heavy water for coolant, reached criticality during a test run on 9 December, with the control vanes at 65°. It was estimated that without the heavy water, 71° would have been required. Boron rods were then inserted into the six central tie tubes. This lowered the reactivity of the core, and the vanes had to be turned to 132° before criticality was achieved. Oralloy foils were placed in the core tubes, and the reactor was run at 150 W for ten minutes.

The next set of tests involved blowing air through the reactor while it was subcritical to test the integrity of the components under conditions of strain and vibration. On 17 and 18 December, air flow rates of for 30 seconds. During what was intended to be the final qualification test on 11 January 1961, with an air flow rate of and a core temperature of , the clamp holding the exit nozzle to the air duct on the test vehicle broke, and the nozzle flew through the air. Following this mishap, it was decided to conduct a test of radio-controlled disconnection and removal of the reactor from the test vehicle. During this test the electrically controlled coupler between the locomotive and the test vehicle suddenly opened, and the test vehicle careered down the track and violently struck the concrete face of the test pad bunker at the end. The test vehicle was extensively damaged, and had to be stripped down and rebuilt. All the reactor components had to be checked for cracks.

With repairs completed, the Tory II-A was returned to the test pad for another series of tests. It was found that without cooling water, the reactor reached criticality with the control vanes at 75°; with heavy water for coolant it was reached with them at 67°. With hot air flowing through the reactor, the core temperature was raised to , then to , and finally to . It was then operated at 10 KW for 60 seconds at . A final test was conducted on 3 May, with an air flow rate of , a core temperature of and no incidents.

Tory II-A was operated at its designed value on 14 May, when it reached a power output of 46 MW with a core temperature of . Three high power test runs were conducted on 28 September, 5 October and 6 October. These reached power levels of 144, 166 and 162 MW with core temperatures of respectively. With the tests conducted successfully, the reactor was dissembled between December 1961 and September 1962.

== Tory II-C ==
Tory II-A tested the reactor design and the integrity of the fuel elements under a simulation of operational conditions. Livermore now produced a second reactor, Tory II-C, which would be a fully functional engine for a ramjet missile. Issues that had been ignored in the design of Tory II-A had to be resolved in that of Tory II-C. The new design was complete by August 1962. The Tory II-C reactor was cylindrical in shape, long and in diameter. It contained about 293,000 fueled and 16,000 unfueled beryllium oxide tubes, which occupied 55 percent of its volume. The fuel loading varied through the reactor to achieve the right power profile. In operation, the core generated .

The checkout of the test facilities for Tory II-C testing commenced on 17 November 1962. The facilities were incomplete when this testing began, so many of the tests were in support of the construction program. These tests fell into four categories: testing of the air supply system; testing of the other facilities components; qualification of the test vehicle; and operator training. The facilities checkout ended on 5 March 1964, by which time 82 tests had been carried out.

Before attempting a high power reactor test, five major tests were performed. The first test, conducted on 23 March, was a subcritical test of the twelve hand-inserted and six electrically-activated auxiliary shutdown rods. The purpose of the test was to verify that the operational rods could be removed safely so long as the auxiliary rods were in place. This would mean that staff would not have to be removed from the test bunker area during checkout. The test was conducted as if it were a critical one, with all personnel evacuated from the test area and the test managed remotely from the control room. The test verified the predictions made at Livermore; the operational rods could be withdrawn safely. A cold critical test was then conducted the following day to verify that the instrumentation was working correctly.
Hot zero-power tests were conducted on 9 and 23 April. These involved testing the core under air flow conditions approaching those of a full power run. The test plan for the first test called for running air at at a rate of for 60 seconds. The test was aborted and the shim rods scrammed (shut down the reactor) when vibration exceeded a pre-set level. It turned out that the vibration of the core was not the problem: it was the transducers used to measure vibration that were not operating properly. Loose connections were repaired, and a second test scheduled. This time it was planned to operate successively at . This was done, and there was no vibration. The test also qualified the thermocouples used to monitor the core&#x27;s temperature. 

The next step was to conduct a low power test with air at on 7 May. As the air flow was reaching its maximum, shim actuator B2 became noisy and was placed on hold. Then, soon after the maximum was reached, actuator A1 detected a loss of air pressure and scrammed. Actuators A2 and B1 began moving to compensate for the loss of reactivity. A manual scram was then ordered, although in hindsight this was unnecessary. The problem with B2 was traced to a faulty wire, and the problem with A1 to a faulty pressure switch. Since there were no outstanding problems, the decision was taken to proceed with an intermediate power test on 12 May. This test aimed to simulate the conditions of a Mach 2.8 flight at . The reactor was taken to critical and the power increased to 750 kW. Air flow was then increased to at an average temperature of . The core reached . The test was concluded after an hour and 45 minutes.

The stage was now set for a full power test on 20 May 1964. This would simulate a Mach 2.8 flight on a hot day at sea level. The reactor was started and power raised to 700 kW. Air was introduced at and then raised to . The reactor power was then increased to around 76 MW, at which point the core temperature was . All systems were functioning normally, so the airflow was increased to and power increased until the core temperature reached , at which point the power output was around 461 MW. The reactor was run for five minutes, after which a manual scram was initiated, and the airflow reduced to for two minutes. The whole test took about an hour. Inspection of the reactor afterwards was done without disassembly. No blockages or anomalies were detected. The control rods were all in place, and there was no evidence of damage or corrosion.

== Termination==
Despite the successful tests, the Department of Defense, the sponsor of the Pluto project, had second thoughts. ICBM technology had developed more quickly than expected, reducing the need for such highly capable cruise missiles. The were concerns about whether something so noisy, hot and radioactive could go undetected, and it would be dangerous to anyone and anything in its path. An ICBM traveled to its target faster and was less vulnerable to interception by Soviet air defenses. The main advantage of the SLAM was its ability to carry a larger payload, but the value of this was diminished by improvements in nuclear weapon design that made them smaller and lighter, and the subsequent development of multiple warhead capability in ICBMs.

The other major problem with the SLAM concept was the environmental damage caused by radioactive emissions during flight, and the disposal of the reactor at the end of the mission. Merkle estimated that about 100 grams of fission products would be produced, of which he expected a few grams to be released and dispersed over a wide area. Atmospheric nuclear testing was still ongoing in the early 1960s, so the radioactive emissions were not considered to be a major problem by comparison. Although small compared to that produced by a nuclear explosion, it was a problem for testing. The noise level was estimated to be a deafening 150 decibels. There was also the possibility of the missile going out of control.

The idea of testing it over Nevada was quickly discarded. It was proposed to conduct test flights in the vicinity of Wake Island, flying a figure-eight course. The reactor would then be dumped into the Pacific Ocean where it was deep. By the early 1960s there was increasing public awareness of the undesirable environmental impacts of radioactive contamination of the atmosphere and the ocean, and the radioactive emissions from the missile were considered unacceptable wherever the tests were conducted.

The AEC requested $8 million (equivalent to $ million in ) in fiscal year 1965 for continued tests of Tory II-C and the development of Tory III, an improved version. In April 1964, the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy recommended that $1.5 million be cut from this request. This provided continued funding for Tory II-C, but not for the development of Tory III. The Department of Defense&#x27;s Director of Research and Engineering, Harold Brown, favored the continuation of Project Pluto at a low level of funding to progress the technology. This was rejected by the House Appropriations Committee; the technology had been demonstrated by the successful Tory II-C tests, and if there was no longer a military requirement for it, there was no reason to continue funding. It therefore cut another $5.5 million from the funding request, leaving only $1 million for &quot;mothballing&quot; the project.

On 1 July 1964, seven years and six months after it was started, Project Pluto was canceled. Merkle hosted a celebratory dinner at a nearby country club for project participants where SLAM tie tacks and bottles of &quot;Pluto&quot; mineral water were given away as souvenirs. At its peak, Project Pluto had employed around 350 people at Livermore and 100 at Site 401, and the total amount spent had been about $260 million (equivalent to $ billion in ).

== Cleanup ==

The Tory II-C reactor was not disassembled after the high-power test and remained at Jackass Flats until 1976, when it was dissembled at the Engine Maintenance, Assembly, and Disassembly (E-MAD) building there. In 1971 and 1972, Building 2201 was used by the Fuel Repackaging Operations Project. Fuel elements from the Tory II reactors were removed from the hot cells in Building 2201 and taken to Area 6, from whence they were shipped to the Idaho National Laboratory. Building 2201 was used in the 1970s and 1980s to house the Hydrogen Content Test Facility. Starting in 1986, the Sandia National Laboratory used it for a series of classified projects related to nuclear weapons, and in 1998 an unidentified organization used it for a classified project. Building 2201 was cleaned and decontaminated between 2007 and 2009 to make it safe for future demolition. In September 2013, it was reported that it had been demolished.

<doc id="57685" wikidata="Q10590700" url="?curid=57685" title="Music history">
<text>Music history, sometimes called historical musicology, is a highly diverse subfield of the broader discipline of musicology that studies music from a historical point of view. In theory, &quot;music history&quot; could refer to the study of the history of any type or genre of music (e.g., the history of Nigerian music or the history of rock); in practice, these research topics are often categorized as part of ethnomusicology or cultural studies, whether or not they are ethnographically based. The terms &quot;music history&quot; and &quot;historical musicology&quot; usually refer to the history of the notated music of Western elites, sometimes called &quot;art music&quot; (by analogy to art history, which tends to focus on elite art).

The methods of music history include source studies (esp. manuscript studies), paleography, philology (especially textual criticism), style criticism, historiography (the choice of historical method), musical analysis, and iconography. The application of musical analysis to further these goals is often a part of music history, though pure analysis or the development of new tools of music analysis is more likely to be seen in the field of music theory. Some of the intellectual products of music historians include peer-reviewed articles in journals, university press-published music history books, university textbooks, new editions of musical works, biographies of composers and other musicians, studies of the relationship between words and music, and reflections upon the role of music in society.

==Pedagogy==
Although most performers of classical and traditional instruments receive some instruction in music history, whether this is the history of art music, pop, or rock and roll, etc. These from their music teachers throughout their lessons and high school classes, the majority of formal music history courses are offered at the post-secondary (college or university) level. In Canada, some music students receive training prior to undergraduate studies because examinations in music history (as well as music theory) are required to complete Royal Conservatory of Music certification at the Grade 9 level and higher.

Most medium and large institutions will offer music appreciation courses for non-music majors and music history courses for music majors. The two types of courses will usually differ in length (one to two semesters vs. two to four), breadth (many music appreciation courses begin at the late Baroque or classical eras and might omit music after WWII while courses for music majors traditionally span the period from the Middle Ages to the current era), and depth. Both types of courseoach on a narrower subject while introducing more of the tools of research in music history. The range of possible topics is virtually limitless. Some examples might be &quot;Music during World War I,&quot; &quot;Medieval and Renaissance instrumental music,&quot; &quot;Music and politics,&quot; &quot;Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, or Women and music.&quot;

The methods and tools of music history are nearly as many as its subjects and therefore make a strict categorization impossible. However, a few trends and approaches can be outlined here. Like in any other historical discipline, most research in music history can be roughly divided into two categories: the establishing of factual and correct data and the interpretation of data. Most historical research does not fall into one category solely, but rather employs a combination of methods from both categories. The act of establishing factual data can never be fully separate from the act of interpretation.

Archival work may be conducted to find connections to music or musicians in a collection of documents of broader interests (e.g., Vatican pay records, letters to a patroness of the arts) or to more systematically study a collection of documents related to a musician. In some cases, where records, scores, and letters have been digitized, archival work can be done online. One example of a composer for whom archival materials can be examined online is the Arnold Schoenberg Center.

Performance practice draws on many of the tools of historical musicology to answer the specific question of how music was performed in various places at various times in the past. Scholars investigate questions such as which instruments or voices were used to perform a given work, what tempos (or tempo changes) were used, and how (or if) ornaments were used. Although performance practice was previously confined to early music from the Baroque era, since the 1990s, research in performance practice has examined other historical eras, such as how early Classical era piano concerti were performed, how the early history of recording affected the use of vibrato in classical music, or which instruments were used in Klezmer music.

Biographical studies of composers can give us a better sense of the chronology of compositions, influences on style and works, and provide important background to the interpretation (by performers or listeners) of works. Thus biography can form one part of the larger study of the cultural significance, underlying program, or agenda of a work; a study which gained increasing importance in the 1980s and early 1990s.

Sociological studies focus on the function of music in society as well as its meaning for individuals and society as a whole. Researchers emphasizing the social importance of music (including classical music) are sometimes called New musicologists. They may examine the intersection of music and music-making with issues such as race, class, gender, sexuality (e.g. LGBTQ), and disability, among other approaches.

Semiotic studies are most conventionally the province of music analysts rather than historians. However, crucial to the practice of musical semiotics – the interpretation of meaning in a work or style – is its situation in a historical context. The interpretative work of scholars such as Kofi Agawu and Lawrence Kramer fall between the analytic and the music historical.

==History==

===Before 1898===
The first studies of Western musical history date back to the middle of the 18th century. G.B. Martini published a three volume history titled &quot;Storia della musica&quot; (&quot;History of Music&quot;) between 1757 and 1781. Martin Gerbert published a two volume history of sacred music titled &quot;De cantu de musica sacra&quot; in 1774. Gerbert followed this work with a three volume work &quot;Scriptores ecclesiastici de musica sacra&quot; containing significant writings on sacred music from the 3rd century onwards in 1784.

===1800–1950===

In the 20th century, the work of Johannes Wolf and others developed studies in Medieval music and early Renaissance music. Wolf&#x27;s writings on the history of musical notation are considered to be particularly notable by musicologists. Historical musicology has played a critical role in renewed interest in Baroque music as well as medieval and Renaissance music. In particular, the authentic performance movement owes much to historical musicological scholarship. Towards the middle of the 20th century, musicology (and its largest subfield of historical musicology) expanded significantly as a field of study. Concurrently the number of musicological and music journals increased to create further outlets for the publication of research. The domination of German language scholarship ebbed as significant journals sprang up throughout the West, especially America.

==Critiques==

=== Exclusion of disciplines and musics ===
In its most narrow definition, historical musicology is the music history of Western culture. Such a definition arbitrarily excludes disciplines other than history, cultures other than Western, and forms of music other than &quot;classical&quot; (&quot;art&quot;, &quot;serious&quot;, &quot;high culture&quot;) or notated (&quot;artificial&quot;) – implying that the omitted disciplines, cultures, and musical styles/genres are somehow inferior. A somewhat broader definition incorporating all musical humanities is still problematic, because it arbitrarily excludes the relevant (natural) sciences (acoustics, psychology, physiology, neurosciences, information and computer sciences, empirical sociology and aesthetics) as well as musical practice. The musicological sub-disciplines of music theory and music analysis have likewise historically been rather uneasily separated from the most narrow definition of historical musicology.

Within historical musicology, scholars have been reluctant to adopt postmodern and critical approaches that are common elsewhere in the humanities. According to Susan McClary (2000, p. 1285) the discipline of &quot;music lags behind the other arts; it picks up ideas from other media just when they have become outmoded.&quot; Only in the 1990s did historical musicologists, preceded by feminist musicologists in the late 1980s, begin to address issues such as gender, sexualities, bodies, emotions, and subjectivities which dominated the humanities for twenty years before (ibid, p. 10). In McClary&#x27;s words (1991, p. 5), &quot;It almost seems that musicology managed miraculously to pass directly from pre- to postfeminism without ever having to change – or even examine – its ways.&quot; Furthermore, in their discussion on musicology and rock music, Susan McClary and Robert Walser also address a key struggle within the discipline: how musicology has often &quot;dismisse[d] questions of socio-musical interaction out of hand, that part of classical music&#x27;s greatness is ascribed to its autonomy from society.&quot; (1988, p. 283)

=== Exclusion of popular music ===
According to Richard Middleton, the strongest criticism of (historical) musicology has been that it generally ignores popular music. Though musicological study of popular music has vastly increased in quantity recently, Middleton&#x27;s assertion in 1990—that most major &quot;works of musicology, theoretical or historical, act as though popular music did not exist&quot;—holds true. Academic and conservatory training typically only peripherally addresses this broad spectrum of musics, and many (historical) musicologists who are &quot;both contemptuous and condescending are looking for types of production, musical form, and listening which they associate with a &quot;different&quot; kind of music...&#x27;classical music&#x27;...and they generally find popular music lacking&quot;

He cites three main aspects of this problem (p. 104–6). The terminology of historical musicology is &quot;slanted by the needs and history of a particular music (&#x27;classical music&#x27;).&quot; He acknowledges that &quot;there is a rich vocabulary for certain areas [harmony, tonality, certain part-writing and forms], important in musicology&#x27;s typical corpus&quot;; yet he points out that there is &quot;an impoverished vocabulary for other areas [rhythm, pitch nuance and gradation, and timbre], which are less well developed&quot; in Classical music. Middleton argues that a number of &quot;terms are ideologically loaded&quot; in that &quot;they always involve selective, and often unconsciously formulated, conceptions of what music &quot;is&quot;.&quot;

As well, he claims that historical musicology uses &quot;a methodology slanted by the characteristics of notation,&quot; &#x27;notational centricity&#x27; (Tagg 1979, p. 28–32). As a result, &quot;musicological methods tend to foreground those musical parameters which can be easily notated&quot; such as pitch relationships or the relationship between words and music. On the other hand, historical musicology tends to &quot;neglect or have difficulty with parameters which are not easily notated&quot;, such as tone colour or non-Western rhythms. In addition, he claims that the &quot;notation-centric training&quot; of Western music schools &quot;induces particular forms of &quot;listening&quot;, and these then tend to be applied to &quot;all&quot; sorts of music, appropriately or not&quot;. As a result, Western music students trained in historical musicology may listen to a funk or Latin song that is very rhythmically complex, but then dismiss it as a low-level musical work because it has a very simple melody and only uses two or five chords.

Notational centricity also encourages &quot;reification: the score comes to be seen as &#x27;the music&#x27;, or perhaps the music in an ideal form.&quot; As such, music that does not use a written score, such as jazz, blues, or folk, can become demoted to a lower level of status. As well, historical musicology has &quot;an ideology slanted by the origins and development of a particular body of music and its aesthetic...It arose at a specific moment, in a specific context – nineteenth-century Europe, especially Germany – and in close association with that movement in the musical &quot;practice&quot; of the period which was codifying the very repertory then taken by musicology as the centre of its attention.&quot; These terminological, methodological, and ideological problems affect even works sympathetic to popular music. However, it is not &quot;that musicology &quot;cannot&quot; understand popular music, or that students of popular music should abandon musicology.&quot; (Middleton, p. 104).

<text>Homestar Runner is an American comedy animated web series and website created by Mike and Matt Chapman, known collectively as The Brothers Chaps. The series centers on the adventures of a large and diverse cast of characters, headed by the titular character, Homestar Runner. It uses a blend of surreal humor, self-parody, satire, and references to popular culture, in particular video games, classic television, and popular music.

Homestar Runner originated in 1996 as a book written by Mike Chapman and Craig Zobel, intended as a parody of children&#x27;s literature. While learning Macromedia Flash, Mike and his brother Matt expanded the concept into a website, which was launched on New Year&#x27;s Day 2000. While the site originally centered on the title character, the &quot;Strong Bad Email&quot; cartoon skits quickly became the site&#x27;s most popular and prominent feature, with Strong Bad, initially the series&#x27; main antagonist, becoming a breakout character. Since 2000, the site has grown to encompass a variety of cartoons and web games featuring Homestar, Strong Bad, and numerous other characters.

At the peak of its popularity, the site was one of the most-visited sites with collections of Flash cartoons on the web, spreading via word of mouth. The site sustains itself through merchandise sales and has never featured advertisements. The Brothers Chaps have turned down offers to make a television series.

After a four-year hiatus beginning in 2010, Homestar Runner returned with a new Holiday Toon on April 1, 2014, for April Fools&#x27; Day. Afterwards, co-creator Matt Chapman announced plans to give the site semi-regular updates. Since global support for Flash ended on December 31, 2020, homestarrunner.com has maintained a fully functional website through the Flash emulator Ruffle. More cartoons have since been released on the website and its YouTube channel on an occasional basis, usually to celebrate holidays.

==History==

===1996–2000: Development===
&quot;Homestar Runner&quot; was created in Atlanta in 1996 by University of Georgia students Mike Chapman and friend Craig Zobel, who wrote the original picture book, &quot;The Homestar Runner Enters the Strongest Man in the World Contest&quot;, while working summer jobs surrounding the 1996 Summer Olympics.

Matt described the origin of the name &quot;Homestar Runner&quot; as an in-joke between themselves and James Huggins, a childhood friend of the Chapman brothers while growing up in Dunwoody, Georgia.

When Mike and Craig were in a bookstore and made a remark about how &quot;awful&quot; the children&#x27;s books were, the idea to write their own children&#x27;s book occurred to them. They spent around two hours designing the look of Homestar Runner, Pom Pom, Strong Bad, and The Cheat, and completed the book within a day. They only printed about five to ten copies to share with friends, and had no intention to publish it. However, they had no idea that their father had sent out the book as a manuscript for submission to about 80 different publishers, but they only got rejection letters back, if anything. The pair began to work on a sequel, &quot;Homestar Runner Goes for the Gold&quot;, which would have introduced Strong Bad&#x27;s brothers, Strong Mad and Strong Sad, but was eventually abandoned. They later used the Super NES video game &quot;Mario Paint&quot; to create the first cartoon featuring the characters.

===2000–2009: Launch and initial popularity===
Around 1999, Mike recognized how popular Flash animation was taking off, and he and his younger brother Matt Chapman started to learn Flash on their own. Looking for something on which to practice, they found inspiration in the old &quot;children&#x27;s&quot; book. Their initial cartoons were launched on their dedicated website, homestarrunner.com, by 2000. Mike animated the cartoons, Matt provided the voices of the male characters, and Mike&#x27;s girlfriend (now wife) Missy Palmer provided the voice of Marzipan.

They initially started off with shorts that featured competitions between Homestar Runner as a heroic character and Strong Bad as the villain, but these did not really capture viewers. Mike and Matt came up with the idea of animating the scenes between competitions; Matt stated &quot;that was the stuff that was funnier, the stuff happening between the plot points, which is hilarious because we hadn&#x27;t even established a routine of making cartoons about competitions, we&#x27;d made like one&quot;. From May 2000 to February 2001, the website and cartoons started out with different art styles. In February 2001, it gained a new look, which has largely remained consistent to the present with minor changes.

The site grew slowly at first and primarily through word-of-mouth. They were able to sell a &quot;few dozen&quot; T-shirts by 2001. Mike moved back to New York in mid-2001 and he and Matt started crafting the first Strong Bad Email &quot;some kinda robot&quot;, intending this to be a weekly feature. The Strong Bad Email series proved very popular, generating significant interest in the site; when the brothers were late in publishing a new Strong Bad Email, they received angry emails asking where the new short was, which Matt said was &quot;a cool feeling to know you&#x27;re as important as a cup of coffee or morning crossword to some folks&quot;. Their father suggested Matt quit his full-time job to devote time to creating more Homestar Runner shorts. With the number of visitors to the site growing, by January 2003 the site had outgrown its original web host, Yahoo. Merchandise sales paid for all of the costs of running the website as well as living costs of the creators, whose retired parents managed many of the business aspects.

The brothers considered the period between 2002–2005 to be their most creative and successful, exploring various different media for the shorts and having a large quantity of merchandise. Matt considered a day in February 2004 to be the highlight of the series, having received a demo tape from They Might Be Giants for a song to use in a Strong Bad Email short and a life-sized replica of Tom Servo from &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; producer Jim Mallon on the same day. They also reflected on how Homestar Runner had been a common point of reference over which newly formed couples bonded and how Joss Whedon incorporated references to Homestar Runner into his television shows &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot; as further signs of success.

===2009−2014: Hiatus===
Through 2010, Homestar Runner remained financially viable for the brothers through sales of related merchandise. Both brothers were married by 2010 and had their children to care for, and they recognized that they would need to find other jobs to support their respective families. When Matt had a second daughter, the two agreed to put the series on hiatus, knowing they would want to come back to it but could not guarantee a time frame. Mike also noted that they had spent nearly ten years delivering a weekly cartoon, and believed that, creatively, they needed a break. The success of Homestar Runner led to Matt and Mike getting writing jobs for television animated series &quot;Yo Gabba Gabba!&quot;, &quot;Gravity Falls&quot;, &quot;The Aquabats! Super Show!&quot;, and &quot;Wander Over Yonder&quot;.

During this hiatus, the brothers released a small number of Homestar Runner cartoons, including ones for 2010&#x27;s April Fools&#x27; Day and Decemberween holidays. They also made a special video featuring Homestar and Strong Bad for the 2013 San Diego Comic-Con to introduce a panel regarding the history of W00tstock.

===2014–present: Return===
Matt, after completing work on &quot;Gravity Falls&quot;, moved back to Atlanta in 2014 where Mike was living, and the two agreed that they now had the opportunity to return to &quot;Homestar Runner&quot; on a semi-regular basis. Their first short in nearly four years, posted on April 1, 2014, poked fun at how they had not updated the site in years. Matt confirmed their commitment to continue the series in July 2014. Since then, the site has featured occasional updates, usually for holidays. Until 2017, this was mostly due to the brothers&#x27; involvement in developing the Disney XD animated show &quot;Two More Eggs&quot;.

With the impending discontinuation of Adobe Flash in December 2020, most new &quot;Homestar Runner&quot; animations were released directly as videos to YouTube; the brothers also worked to transfer the older Flash content into video format for archival purposes. Prior to Flash&#x27;s discontinuation, the Internet Archive included Homestar Runner content in its collection of Flash animations and games. The content is directly viewable in modern browsers through the Ruffle Flash emulator. The &quot;Homestar Runner&quot; website itself was also updated to use Ruffle, restoring much of its original functionality.

==Characters==

Homestar Runner cartoons typically center on Homestar Runner, Strong Bad, and the other ten main characters: The Cheat, Marzipan, Coach Z, Bubs, Strong Sad, Strong Mad, Pom Pom, the King of Town, the Poopsmith, and Homsar. The Brothers Chaps have described them as “dumb animal characters”. These characters all live in the fictional town of Free Country, USA. Each character has multiple alternate versions of themselves, such as &quot;Old-Timey&quot; and &quot;20X6&quot; versions.

==Cartoons==

&quot;Homestar Runner&quot; features several spin-off series from the main &quot;shorts&quot; and &quot;big toons&quot;, including the most well-known, Strong Bad Email.

=== Strong Bad Email ===
Strong Bad Emails (also known as &quot;sbemails&quot;) is a series featuring Strong Bad answering emails from fans. Since starting in August 2001, the initially brief episodes have grown in length and scope, introducing numerous spin-offs, characters, and inside jokes, such as Homsar, Trogdor, Senor Cardgage, 20X6, the Teen Girl Squad shorts, and Homestar Runner Emails (also known as &quot;hremails&quot;). The format, however, has remained largely unchanged. Each episode typically begins with Strong Bad singing a short song to himself while booting up his computer to check fan emails. Starting a reply, he typically mocks the sender&#x27;s name, spelling, and grammar, and rarely answers questions directly. While early episodes focused mostly on Strong Bad sitting at the computer with occasional cutaways, the cutaways would become more elaborate over time, allowing for more complex story lines to develop, growing tangentially from the initial email. Each episode closes with Strong Bad finishing his reply, closing the episode with a link to email Strong Bad appearing via &quot;The Paper&quot;, a dot matrix printer at the top of the screen. In later episodes, it is replaced with the &quot;New Paper&quot;, an inkjet printer; then with the &quot;Compé-per&quot;, a pop-up balloon; and finally with a CGI version of the original Paper, which instead promotes Strong Bad&#x27;s Twitter account. As of April 1, 2022, 209 Strong Bad Emails have been released on the website (with another six exclusive to DVD releases), separable into distinct eras by Strong Bad&#x27;s different computers; the Tandy 400, the Compy 386, the Lappy 486, the Compé, and his current computer, the Lappier.

=== Holiday Specials ===
Prior to the 2010 hiatus, holiday specials were a regular feature of the site, released to coincide with popular holidays, specifically Halloween and Decemberween (a fictional holiday similar to Christmas also celebrated on December 25). Halloween shorts typically feature the main characters celebrating a traditional aspect of the holiday (such as ghost stories, trick-or-treating or pumpkin carving) in costume, often making obscure pop culture references. The site also usually releases a separate Halloween video where Strong Bad views a slideshow and mocks and/or appraises photos sent in by real life fans of their Halloween costumes and props modeled after &quot;Homestar Runner&quot; characters and other elements. Similarly, Decemberween cartoons typically satirize Christmas traditions such as gift-giving and carol-singing. The fact that it takes place on the same day as Christmas has been presented as just a coincidence, having been stated that Decemberween takes place &quot;55 days after Halloween&quot;. April Fools&#x27; Day features various gags, such as turning the site into a paid subscription service, or turning it upside down.

Other holidays celebrated include New Year&#x27;s Day, &quot;The Big Game&quot; (around the time of the Super Bowl), St. Valentine&#x27;s Day, Mother&#x27;s Day, &quot;Senorial Day&quot; (a parody of Memorial Day featuring the character Senor Cardgage), Flag Day, Independence Day, Labor Day (occasionally referred to as &quot;Labor Dabor&quot;), Thanksgiving, and Easter.

===Teen Girl Squad===
Teen Girl Squad is a crudely drawn comic strip narrated by Strong Bad, using a falsetto voice. The series was a spin off of Strong Bad Email #53, &quot;comic&quot;, in which Strong Bad is asked to make a comic strip of a girl and her friends. The comic features four archetypal teenage girls, &quot;Cheerleader&quot;, &quot;So and So&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s Her Face&quot; and &quot;The Ugly One&quot;, and satirizes high school life, teen movies, and television. Each episode follows the girls in typical high school situations, often leading to their gruesome deaths. A spinoff of this series is &quot;4 Gregs&quot;, which follows four of the squad&#x27;s nerdy classmates, all named Greg.

===Marzipan&#x27;s Answering Machine===
Marzipan&#x27;s Answering Machine is a series of cartoons with almost no animation. It features messages from the other characters, being played on the answering machine belonging to the character Marzipan. In early episodes, the episode number ended in .0 (for example, Marzipan&#x27;s Answering Machine Version 5.0), but since Marzipan changed to a new answering machine, the number ends in .2 (for example, Marzipan&#x27;s Answering Machine Version 15.2). In every episode, Strong Bad prank calls Marzipan, badly pretending to be someone else, such as &quot;Detective Everybody&quot;, &quot;Safety Dan&quot;, and sometimes other characters. Although the animation is usually just a picture of the answering machine, sometimes there are short animated segments featuring the characters. As of April 1, 2016, there are 17 Marzipan&#x27;s Answering Machines.

===Puppet Stuff===
These are live action shorts in which the regular characters are depicted by puppets. These may be skits, or musical performances with They Might Be Giants. Many Puppet Stuff videos feature the characters interacting with children, often related to The Brothers Chaps. One spin-off series, &quot;Biz Cas Fri&quot;, depicts Homestar and Strong Bad&#x27;s interactions from his office cubicle at work. The first Biz Cas Fri video arguably first coined the term &quot;Doge&quot;.

===Powered By The Cheat===
In-universe, “Powered By The Cheat” videos are short cartoons made by the character of The Cheat, and are often music videos done for other characters. During these segments, Matt Chapman does the animation and Mike Chapman provides the voices, a switching of their usual roles. As a result, the cartoons are deliberately poorly animated.

=== Alternate Universes ===
Over time, many alternate versions of the Homestar Runner world and characters would appear, parodying other cartoons and animation styles. Many of these feature in their own cartoons. The many alternate universes would later cross over in some cartoons, such as the 150th Strong Bad Email, &quot;alternate universe&quot;.

Old-Timey cartoons take place in an old-time setting, with most of the characters being Old-Timey counterparts of the &quot;Homestar Runner&quot; characters. These cartoons are in black and white with a film grain effect and scratchy audio quality. They parody the distinctive style of animated cartoons during the 1920s and 1930s (à la Steamboat Willie), and can be seen as perhaps deliberately unfunny, to make a slanted joke about such old-style cartoons.

&quot;20X6&quot; (pronounced &quot;twenty exty-six&quot;), a parody of the Mega Man and EarthBound games&#x27; &quot;year 200X&quot;, originated from Strong Bad Email #57, &quot;japanese cartoon&quot;, an email asking Strong Bad what he would look like if he were in a Japanese anime. The main character, Stinkoman, is an anime version of Strong Bad with blue hair, a shiny body and robot boots. He is always looking for a fight, asking various characters he interacts with to engage him in a &quot;challenge&quot; (&quot;Are you asking for a challenge?&quot;). There is also a game, &quot;Stinkoman 20X6&quot;, which is heavily based on the Mega Man series.

&quot;Cheat Commandos&quot; is a parody of &quot;G.I. Joe&quot; that features a cast of characters that are the same species as The Cheat. Most are based on G.I. Joe characters, or characters from other 1980s cartoons. The cartoon is constantly advertising its products in the cartoons by such methods as referring to the areas they are in as &quot;playsets&quot;, a convoy truck as an &quot;action figure storage vehicle&quot;, and by ending each cartoon with the phrase &quot;Buy all our playsets and toys!&quot;, sung in a patriotic way. It also parodies the G.I. Joe cartoons&#x27; use of public service announcements, referring to nonsensical things like &quot;peer-2-teen choice behaviors&quot;. Some cartoons feature the character Crack Stuntman, the fictional voice actor for the Cheat Commandos character Gunhaver.

==Other media==

=== Music ===
The Homestar Runner site frequently features songs and videos within their animated shorts or as stand-alone entities. These are primarily sung and performed either by the characters or by fictitious artists serving as parodies of various genres. Real-life musicians They Might Be Giants have collaborated multiple times with the Homestar Runner site. In 2004, the Homestar Runner characters were featured in the music video to their song Experimental Film. Additionally, they have performed multiple times with a puppet of Homestar Runner. They have also collaborated on several other shorts, including Strong Bad Email #200, &quot;email thunder&quot;.

In Strong Bad Email #58, &quot;dragon&quot;, Strong Bad is asked to draw a dragon, creating Trogdor, the Burninator (stylized as TROGDOR, the BURNİNATOR), and performing his heavy metal theme song. Trogdor&#x27;s popularity saw the character appear on merchandise such as T-shirts, hoodies, and posters, with an extended version of the song appearing on the CD &quot;Strong Bad Sings&quot;.

In 2002, a fictional hair metal band, Limozeen, was introduced as a parody of 1980s bands such as Skid Row, White Lion and Poison; with songs including &quot;Because, It&#x27;s Midnite&quot; and &quot;Nite Mamas&quot;. On March 17, 2008, &quot;Limozeen&quot; (actually the Atlanta indie band Y-O-U along with Matt Chapman on vocals) performed a live show in Atlanta, Georgia, and again on November 8, 2008, opening for indie pop band of Montreal. A college rock band called Sloshy (with the logo stylized in lower case and rotated 180 degrees, with the &quot;o&quot; being a different color, as &quot;ʎɥsoןs&quot;) was introduced in 2007. Sloshy features songs in the musical vein of Pavement such as &quot;We Don&#x27;t Really Even Care About You&quot; and &quot;The B-est of B-Sides&quot;. Other fictitious artists include Scandinavian death metal parody Taranchula (although performing more in a thrash metal/sludge metal style); rapper Peacey P, with a rapping style resembling that of Snoop Dogg; and the self-absorbed R&amp;B artist Tenerence Love, a parody of Barry White and such artists.

===Browser games===
Beyond cartoons, &quot;Homestar Runner&quot; offers a variety of online games. Early games such as the Homestar Soundboard, &quot;Homestar Talker&quot;, and Lite-Brite emulator &quot;Astro-Lite 2600&quot; are basic web toys featuring the characters, and can now be found on the &quot;Old Games&quot; section of the site. Over time, more recent games have diversified and become more complex, with many being released as products of &quot;Videlectrix&quot;, a game company within the world of Homestar Runner and a side project of The Brothers Chaps, spoofing games of the 1980s. Often the games would originate as video games played by the characters in the cartoon, such as &quot;Secret Collect&quot;, &quot;StrongBadZone&quot;, and &quot;Strong Bad&#x27;s RhinoFeeder&quot;, all parodies of early Atari and arcade games, originating in the Strong Bad Email &quot;video games&quot;.

&quot;TROGDOR!&quot; which previously appeared in the &quot;Arcade Game&quot; short, features the titular dragon Trogdor the Burninator attempting to burn all the cottages on each stage without being slain by knights. A spin-off of &quot;TROGDOR!&quot;, called &quot;Peasant&#x27;s Quest&quot;, is an adventure game featuring Rather Dashing, a young peasant in short pants. After he finds his cottage burned to the ground, he vows to kill the destroyer of his cottage, Trogdor. The game uses a system that is a near-replica of Sierra Entertainment&#x27;s Adventure Game Interpreter, used in &quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot;, &quot;Space Quest&quot; and several other early Sierra titles. This system is something like text adventure games yet it has simple visuals. &quot;Stinkoman 20X6&quot; is a Mega Man-style platform game featuring the characters and world of anime parody 20X6. Nine levels were added to the game over the course of 2005, while the tenth and final level was not released until December 2020, days before Flash would no longer be supported by browsers.

The &quot;Thy Dungeonman&quot; series are parodies of text adventure games originating from Strong Bad Email #94, &quot;video games&quot;. In each game, your goal is to &quot;get ye flask&quot;. Though the game purports to be set in the medieval era, the text is actually rendered in mock Early Modern English, in the style of William Shakespeare. &quot;Thy Dungeonman&quot; has two sequels: &quot;Thy Dungeonman II&quot;, which expands on the features of the original game and can only be found on the Videlectrix site, and &quot;Thy Dungeonman III&quot; which adds basic graphics and can be found on the Homestar Runner site. &quot;Ye Flask&quot; and &quot;You can&#x27;t get ye flask&quot; have become catch-phrases in the Homestar Runner universe, eventually spawning a T-shirt in the Homestar Runner store.

In 2007, the website produced Wii versions of some of the games on the site, for the Wii internet browser. When played on a computer, they use the mouse only.

Two point-and-click adventure game titles by the Brothers Chaps made in Unity have been released to Steam and Itch.io, &quot;Halloween Hide &amp; Seek&quot; and &quot;Dangeresque: The Roomisode Triungulate&quot;, an expanded remake of the original &quot;Dangeresque: Roomisode 1&quot; web game that adds two new episodes.

===Strong Bad&#x27;s Cool Game for Attractive People===

On April 10, 2008, an episodic licensed game based on the series centering around Strong Bad titled &quot;Strong Bad&#x27;s Cool Game for Attractive People&quot; (abbreviated as &quot;SBCG4AP&quot;) was announced for the Wii&#x27;s WiiWare service and Microsoft Windows, developed by Telltale Games in partnership with Videlectrix. The first episode, &quot;Homestar Ruiner&quot;, premiered on August 11, 2008 on Telltale Games&#x27; website and in North America on Nintendo&#x27;s WiiWare service on August 11, 2008. It was also released in Europe and Australia the following Friday (August 15, 2008). The second episode, &quot;Strong Badia the Free&quot;, was released on September 15 on the WiiWare service in North America and on the Telltale Games&#x27; website, and in the PAL region on October 3. The third episode, &quot;Baddest of the Bands&quot;, was released on Telltale Games&#x27; website and the WiiWare service in North America on October 27, and to the PAL region on November 21. The fourth episode, &quot;Dangeresque 3: The Criminal Projective&quot;, was released on Telltale Games&#x27; website and WiiWare in North America on November 17, and in the PAL region on December 5. The fifth and final episode, &quot;8-Bit is Enough&quot;, was released to North America on December 15 and in the PAL region on January 2, 2009. In 2010, it was decided that Telltale games would release &quot;SBCG4AP&quot; for the Mac operating system after a vote on the Telltale Games website.

===Poker Night at the Inventory===

Strong Bad appears as one of the computer-controlled opponents in Telltale&#x27;s &quot;Poker Night at the Inventory&quot;, using the same model from SBCG4AP. Players can unlock in-game card sets and table designs based on Homestar Runner. Additionally, Strong Bad will occasionally bet Dangeresque Too&#x27;s sunglasses in place of in-game cash; defeating him after doing so will unlock the glasses as an equippable cosmetic item for the Demoman in &quot;Team Fortress 2&quot;. The game was released for PC and Mac on November 22, 2010.

===Trogdor!! The Board Game===
&quot;Trogdor!! The Board Game&quot; is a board game made by The Brothers Chaps in collaboration with James Ernest. The campaign was put on Kickstarter on Tuesday, July 17, 2018, with a goal of $75,000, which was surpassed in the first few hours. The campaign ended on Wednesday, August 15, 2018, with a total of $1,421,903 (nearly 20 times the goal) and 23,338 backers. In 2022, an expansion pack titled &quot;Majicks &amp; &#x27;Mergencies Expando Deck&quot; was released, adding new cards and gameplay elements. Extra copies are sold in the website&#x27;s store.

Trogdor!! is described as a cooperative puzzle area control game in which the players work together to burninate all of the game tiles, thatched-roof cottages, and peasants. Every player controls Trogdor, assuming the role of one of the twelve &quot;Keepers of Trogdor&quot;. Each Keeper has unique powers and items, both decided by cards. The game is for one to six players, and play time is 30 minutes with variable levels of difficulty the players can set. The recommended age is 14+. It comes with a mini-game titled &quot;Stack &#x27;Em To The Heavens&quot; in which you stack the meeples in different ways. An album titled &quot;Trogdor!! The Board Game Rulebook EP&quot;, was made to explain the rules of the game.

===Unofficial email worm===
An email worm named Lacon, which featured Homestar Runner characters, was created and distributed by someone going by the name of DimenZion in 2003. It affected 32-bit Windows computers on the 10th of each month, emailing copies of itself to contacts in the computer&#x27;s address book, and also adding various .exe files to the hard drive. Its final payload showed a Homestar Runner Flash animation called &quot;The System is Down&quot; in a browser window.

== Impact ==

=== Collaborations with other artists ===

The Brothers Chaps have partnered up with rock band They Might Be Giants and supplied animation for a music video of their song &quot;Experimental Film&quot;. The creators of &quot;Homestar Runner&quot; spent time with the band and wrote songs that have been released on the website as &quot;Puppet Jam&quot;, a spin-off of &quot;Puppet Stuff&quot;, where Puppet Homestar sings with TMBG. TMBG also wrote the music for Strong Bad Email #99, &quot;different town&quot;, and the band wrote and vocalized the intro song of the 200th Strong Bad Email. Another group, The Skate Party, helped The Brothers Chaps create &quot;The Cheat Theme Song&quot;. The band Y-O-U helped with the Strong Bad Sings and Other Type Hits CD, as well as songs on the strongbad_email.exe DVDs. The Brothers Chaps also employed the services of Paul and Storm of the a cappella band Da Vinci&#x27;s Notebook to create a theme song for the Old-Timey version of The Cheat, called &quot;Ballad of The Sneak&quot;; the duo later wrote the theme tune for the &quot;Stinkoman 20X6&quot; game. Matt Chapman provided guest vocals as Strong Bad on The Aquabats&#x27; &quot;Pink Pants!&quot; from their 2011 album, &quot;Hi-Five Soup!&quot;. Strong Bad&#x27;s voice also appears on Shellac&#x27;s &quot;Genuine Lulabelle&quot; off the album &quot;Excellent Italian Greyhound&quot; from 2007.

Discussing how he and his sibling decide which projects to work on, Mike Chapman said, &quot;We learned how to politely say no to things that were going to affect our lives negatively. If it&#x27;s going to be fun, if we&#x27;re going to enjoy doing it, and if the end project is going to be something we want to have happen, we say yes.&quot;

===Reception===
In 2003, the site received several million hits a month and almost a thousand emails a day. According to Matt Chapman, the site did no advertising, but grew on word of mouth and endorsements. &quot;Certain bands, like fairly popular bands and stuff would link us on their site and, you know we were Shockwave site of the day a couple of times over the years.&quot; &quot;Homestar Runner&quot; popularity, coupled with its positive critical response, has led to the website receiving widespread coverage. &quot;Homestar Runner&quot; has been featured in &quot;Wired&quot;, &quot;National Review&quot;, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, &quot;Total Gamer&quot;, G4, and NPR&#x27;s &quot;All Things Considered&quot;.

A review published in &quot;National Review&quot; characterized the site&#x27;s humor as having &quot;the innocence of slapstick with sharp satire of American popular culture&quot; — humor that &quot;tends to be cultural, not political.&quot;

The site-generated music has enjoyed surprising popularity, such that two songs, &quot;Trogdor&quot; by the character Strong Bad and &quot;Because, It&#x27;s Midnite&quot; by Limozeen, have been included in the successful &quot;Guitar Hero II&quot; and &quot;Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s&quot; video games, respectively.

<text>Anxiety disorders are a group of mental disorders characterized by significant and uncontrollable feelings of anxiety and fear such that a person&#x27;s social, occupational, and personal functions are significantly impaired. Anxiety may cause physical and cognitive symptoms, such as restlessness, irritability, easy fatigue, difficulty concentrating, increased heart rate, chest pain, abdominal pain, and a variety of other symptoms that may vary based on the individual.

In casual discourse, the words &quot;anxiety&quot; and &quot;fear&quot; are often used interchangeably. In clinical usage, they have distinct meanings; anxiety is clinically defined as an unpleasant emotional state for which the cause is either not readily identified or perceived to be uncontrollable or unavoidable, whereas fear is clinically defined as an emotional and physiological response to a recognized external threat. The umbrella term &#x27;anxiety disorder&#x27; refers to a number of specific disorders that include fears (phobias) and/or anxiety symptoms.

There are several types of anxiety disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder, hypochondriasis, specific phobia, social anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, panic disorder, and selective mutism. Individual disorders can be diagnosed using the specific and unique symptoms, triggering events, and timing. A medical professional must evaluate a person before diagnosing them with an anxiety disorder to ensure that their anxiety cannot be attributed to another medical illness or mental disorder. It is possible for an individual to have more than one anxiety disorder during their life or to have more than one anxiety disorder at the same time. Comorbid mental disorders or substance use disorders are common in those with anxiety. Comorbid depression (lifetime prevalence) is seen in 20-70% of those with social anxiety disorder, 50% of those with panic disorder and 43% of those with general anxiety disorder. The 12 month prevalence of alcohol or substance use disorders in those with anxiety disorders is 16.5%.

Worldwide, anxiety disorders are the second most common type of mental disorders after depressive disorders. Anxiety disorders affect nearly 30% of adults at some point in their lives, with an estimated 4% of the global population currently experiencing an anxiety disorder. However, anxiety disorders are treatable, and a number of effective treatments are available. Most people are able to lead normal, productive lives with some form of treatment.

==Types==
=== Generalized anxiety disorder ===

Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a common disorder characterized by long-lasting anxiety that is not focused on any one object or situation. Those with generalized anxiety disorder experience non-specific persistent fear and worry and become overly concerned with everyday matters. Generalized anxiety disorder is &quot;characterized by chronic excessive worry accompanied by three or more of the following symptoms: restlessness, fatigue, concentration problems, irritability, muscle tension, and sleep disturbance&quot;. Generalized anxiety disorder is the most common anxiety disorder to affect older adults. Anxiety can be a symptom of a medical or substance use disorder problem, and medical professionals must be aware of this. A diagnosis of GAD is made when a person has been excessively worried about an everyday problem for six months or more. These stresses can include family life, work, social life, or their own health. A person may find that they have problems making daily decisions and remembering commitments as a result of a lack of concentration and/or preoccupation with worry. A symptom can be a strained appearance, with increased sweating from the hands, feet, and axillae, along with tearfulness, which can suggest depression. Before a diagnosis of anxiety disorder is made, physicians must rule out drug-induced anxiety and other medical causes.

In children, GAD may be associated with headaches, restlessness, abdominal pain, and heart palpitations. Typically, it begins around eight to nine years of age.

===Specific phobias===
The largest category of anxiety disorders is that of specific phobias, which includes all cases in which fear and anxiety are triggered by a specific stimulus or situation. Between 5% and 12% of the population worldwide has specific phobias. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, a phobia is an intense fear of or aversion to specific objects or situations. Individuals with a phobia typically anticipate terrifying consequences from encountering the object of their fear, which can be anything from an animal to a location to a bodily fluid to a particular situation. Common phobias are flying, blood, water, highway driving, and tunnels. When people are exposed to their phobia, they may experience trembling, shortness of breath, or rapid heartbeat. People with specific phobias often go to extreme lengths to avoid encountering their phobia. People with specific phobias understand that their fear is not proportional to the actual potential danger, but they can still become overwhelmed by it.

===Panic disorder===

With panic disorder, a person has brief attacks of intense terror and apprehension, often marked by trembling, shaking, confusion, dizziness, or difficulty breathing. These panic attacks are defined by the APA as fear or discomfort that abruptly arises and peaks in less than ten minutes but can last for several hours. Attacks can be triggered by stress, irrational thoughts, general fear, fear of the unknown, or even when engaging in exercise. However, sometimes the trigger is unclear, and attacks can arise without warning. To help prevent an attack, one can avoid the trigger. This can mean avoiding places, people, types of behaviors, or certain situations that have been known to cause a panic attack. This being said, not all attacks can be prevented.

In addition to recurrent and unexpected panic attacks, a diagnosis of panic disorder requires that said attacks have chronic consequences: either worry over the attacks&#x27; potential implications, persistent fear of future attacks, or significant changes in behavior related to the attacks. As such, those with panic disorder experience symptoms even outside of specific panic episodes. Often, normal changes in heartbeat are noticed, leading them to think something is wrong with their heart or they are about to have another panic attack. In some cases, a heightened awareness (hypervigilance) of body functioning occurs during panic attacks, wherein any perceived physiological change is interpreted as a possible life-threatening illness (i.e., extreme hypochondriasis).

Panic disorder is commonly comorbid with anxiety due to the consistent fight or flight response that one’s brain is being put under at such a high repetitive rate. Another one of the very big leading causes of someone developing a panic disorder has a lot to do with one’s childhood. The article provides knowledge on a positive trend in children who experience abuse and have low self-esteem to later on develop disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder. 

===Agoraphobia===

Agoraphobia is a specific anxiety disorder wherein an individual is afraid of being in a place or situation where escape is difficult or embarrassing or where help may be unavailable. Agoraphobia is strongly linked with panic disorder and is often precipitated by the fear of having a panic attack. A common manifestation involves needing to be in constant view of a door or other escape route. In addition to the fears themselves, the term agoraphobia is often used to refer to avoidance behaviors that individuals often develop. For example, following a panic attack while driving, someone with agoraphobia may develop anxiety over driving and will therefore avoid driving. These avoidance behaviors can have serious consequences and often reinforce the fear they are caused by. In a severe case of agoraphobia, the person may never leave their home.

===Social anxiety disorder===

Social anxiety disorder (SAD), also known as social phobia, describes an intense fear and avoidance of negative public scrutiny, public embarrassment, humiliation, or social interaction. This fear can be specific to particular social situations (such as public speaking) or it can be experienced in most or all social situations. Roughly 7% of American adults have social anxiety disorder, and more than 75% of people experience their first symptoms in their childhood or early teenage years. Social anxiety often manifests specific physical symptoms, including blushing, sweating, rapid heart rate, and difficulty speaking. As with all phobic disorders, those with social anxiety often attempt to avoid the source of their anxiety; in the case of social anxiety, this is particularly problematic, and in severe cases, it can lead to complete social isolation.

Children are also affected by social anxiety disorder, although their associated symptoms are different from those of teenagers and adults. They may experience difficulty processing or retrieving information, sleep deprivation, disruptive behaviors in class, and irregular class participation.

Social physique anxiety (SPA) is a sub-type of social anxiety involving concern over the evaluation of one&#x27;s body by others. SPA is common among adolescents, especially females.

===Post-traumatic stress disorder===

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was once an anxiety disorder (now moved to &quot;trauma- and stressor-related disorders&quot; in the DSM-V) that results from a traumatic experience. PTSD affects approximately 3.5% of U.S. adults every year, and an estimated one in eleven people will be diagnosed with PTSD in their lifetime. Post-traumatic stress can result from an extreme situation, such as combat, natural disaster, rape, hostage situations, child abuse, bullying, or even a serious accident. It can also result from long-term (chronic) exposure to a severe stressor— for example, soldiers who endure individual battles but cannot cope with continuous combat. Common symptoms include hypervigilance, flashbacks, avoidant behaviors, anxiety, anger, and depression. In addition, individuals may experience sleep disturbances. People who have PTSD often try to detach themselves from their friends and family and have difficulty maintaining these close relationships. There are a number of treatments that form the basis of the care plan for those with PTSD; such treatments include cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), prolonged exposure therapy, stress inoculation therapy, medication, psychotherapy, and support from family and friends.

Post-traumatic stress disorder research began with US military veterans of the Vietnam War, as well as natural and non-natural disaster victims. Studies have found the degree of exposure to a disaster to be the best predictor of PTSD.

===Separation anxiety disorder===

Separation anxiety disorder (SepAD) is the feeling of excessive and inappropriate levels of anxiety over being separated from a person or place. Separation anxiety is a normal part of development in babies or children, and it is only when this feeling is excessive or inappropriate that it can be considered a disorder. Separation anxiety disorder affects roughly 7% of adults and 4% of children, but childhood cases tend to be more severe; in some instances, even a brief separation can produce panic. Treating a child earlier may prevent problems. This may include training the parents and family on how to deal with it. Often, the parents will reinforce the anxiety because they do not know how to properly work through it with the child. In addition to parent training and family therapy, medication, such as SSRIs, can be used to treat separation anxiety.

===Obsessive–compulsive disorder===

Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is not an anxiety disorder in the DSM-5 or the ICD-11. However, it was classified as such in older versions of the DSM-IV and ICD-10. OCD manifests in the form of obsessions (distressing, persistent, and intrusive thoughts or images) and compulsions (urges to repeatedly perform specific acts or rituals) that are not caused by drugs or physical disorders and which cause anxiety or distress plus (more or less important) functional disabilities. OCD affects roughly 1–2% of adults (somewhat more women than men) and under 3% of children and adolescents.

A person with OCD knows that the symptoms are unreasonable and struggles against both the thoughts and the behavior. Their symptoms could be related to external events they fear, such as their home burning down because they forgot to turn off the stove, or they could worry that they will behave inappropriately. The compulsive rituals are personal rules they follow to relieve discomfort, such as needing to verify that the stove is turned off a specific number of times before leaving the house.

It is not certain why some people have OCD, but behavioral, cognitive, genetic, and neurobiological factors may be involved. Risk factors include family history, being single, being of a higher socioeconomic class, or not being in paid employment. Of those with OCD, about 20% of people will overcome it, and symptoms will at least reduce over time for most people (a further 50%).

===Selective mutism===

Selective mutism (SM) is a disorder in which a person who is normally capable of speech does not speak in specific situations or to specific people. Selective mutism usually co-exists with shyness or social anxiety. People with selective mutism stay silent even when the consequences of their silence include shame, social ostracism, or even punishment. Selective mutism affects about 0.8% of people at some point in their lives.

Testing for selective mutism is important because doctors must determine if it is an issue associated with the child&#x27;s hearing or movements associated with the jaw or tongue and if the child can understand when others are speaking to them. Generally, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the recommended approach for treating selective mutism, but prospective long-term outcome studies are lacking.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of anxiety disorders is made by symptoms, triggers, and a person&#x27;s personal and family histories. There are no objective biomarkers or laboratory tests that can diagnose anxiety. It is important for a medical professional to evaluate a person for other medical and mental causes of prolonged anxiety because treatments will vary considerably.

Numerous questionnaires have been developed for clinical use and can be used for an objective scoring system. Symptoms may vary between each sub-type of generalized anxiety disorder. Generally, symptoms must be present for at least six months, occur more days than not, and significantly impair a person&#x27;s ability to function in daily life. Symptoms may include: feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge; worrying excessively; difficulty concentrating; restlessness; and irritability.

Questionnaires developed for clinical use include the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7), the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), the Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale, and the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale. Other questionnaires combine anxiety and depression measurements, such as the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ), and the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS). Examples of specific anxiety questionnaires include the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS), the Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS), the Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN), the Social Phobia Scale (SPS), and the Social Anxiety Questionnaire (SAQ-A30).

The GAD-7 has a sensitivity of 57-94% and a specificity of 82-88% in the diagnosis of general anxiety disorder. All screening questionnaires, if positive, should be followed by clinical interview including assessment of impairment and distress, avoidance behaviors, symptom history and persistence to definitively diagnose an anxiety disorder. Some organizations support routinely screening all adults for anxiety disorders, with the US Preventative Services Task Force recommending screening for all adults younger than 65.

===Differential diagnosis===

Anxiety disorders differ from developmentally normal fear or anxiety by being excessive or persisting beyond developmentally appropriate periods. They differ from transient fear or anxiety, often stress-induced, by being persistent (e.g., typically lasting 6 months or more), although the criterion for duration is intended as a general guide with allowance for some degree of flexibility and is sometimes of shorter duration in children.

The diagnosis of an anxiety disorder requires first ruling out an underlying medical cause. Diseases that may present similar to an anxiety disorder include certain endocrine diseases (hypo- and hyperthyroidism, hyperprolactinemia), metabolic disorders (diabetes), deficiency states (low levels of vitamin D, B2, B12, folic acid), gastrointestinal diseases (celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, inflammatory bowel disease), heart diseases, blood diseases (anemia), and brain degenerative diseases (Parkinson&#x27;s disease, dementia, multiple sclerosis, Huntington&#x27;s disease).

Several drugs can also cause or worsen anxiety, whether through intoxication, withdrawal, or chronic use. These include alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, sedatives (including prescription benzodiazepines), opioids (including prescription painkillers and illicit drugs like heroin), stimulants (such as caffeine, cocaine, and amphetamines), hallucinogens, and inhalants.

==Prevention==
Focus is increasing on the prevention of anxiety disorders. There is tentative evidence to support the use of cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness therapy. A 2013 review found no effective measures to prevent GAD in adults. A 2017 review found that psychological and educational interventions had a small benefit for the prevention of anxiety. Research indicates that predictors of the emergence of anxiety disorders partly differ from the factors that predict their persistence.

A big factor that goes into anxiety disorder prevention starts in childhood. Based on the cited article, parents have a big part in whether or not their child will develop anxiety in their future. Specific interventions have been tested to educate parents with young children on how to care and prevent a disorder like anxiety from becoming a bigger issue in their child’s teen to adult life. The study also shared that since it is such a new intervention that there is not much information on long term results, however it does seem to be looking in a positive direction. 

== Perception and discrimination ==

=== Stigma ===
People with an anxiety disorder may be challenged by prejudices and stereotypes held by other people, most likely as a result of misconceptions around anxiety and anxiety disorders. Misconceptions found in a data analysis from the National Survey of Mental Health Literacy and Stigma include: (1) many people believe anxiety is not a real medical illness; and (2) many people believe that people with anxiety could turn it off if they wanted to. For people experiencing the physical and mental symptoms of an anxiety disorder, stigma and negative social perception can make an individual less likely to seek treatment.

Prejudice that some people with mental illness turn against themselves is called self-stigma.

There is no explicit evidence for the exact cause of stigma towards anxiety. Stigma can be divided by social scale, into the macro, intermediate, and micro levels. The macro-level marks society as a whole with the influence of mass media. The intermediate level includes healthcare professionals and their perspectives. The micro-level details the individual&#x27;s contributions to the process through self-stigmatization.

It has become very prevalent that many college students undergo some sort of mental disorder in their early adulthood. Anxiety has become one of the main ones that has grown in prevalence over time. This is due to many issues such as different social pressures, school, career worries, etc. This has not only affected a lot of the youth in today’s world but their overall quality of life. However, it is important to bring this issue to light since there is such a negative stigma when it comes to mental health; but rather than ignoring it and letting the issue grow exponentially larger, it is important to recognize ways that it can be lessened for future generations. 

Stigma can be described in three conceptual ways: cognitive, emotional, and behavioral. This allows for differentiation between stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination.

==Treatment==
Treatment options include psychotherapy, medications and lifestyle changes. There is no clear evidence as to whether psychotherapy or medication is more effective; the specific medication decision can be made by a doctor and patient with consideration for the patient&#x27;s specific circumstances and symptoms. If, while on treatment with a chosen medication, the person&#x27;s anxiety does not improve, another medication may be offered. Specific treatments will vary by sub-type of anxiety disorder, a person&#x27;s other medical conditions, and medications.

===Psychological techniques===
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is effective for anxiety disorders and is a first-line treatment. CBT is the most widely studied and preferred form of psychotherapy for anxiety disorders. CBT appears to be equally effective when carried out via the internet compared to sessions completed face-to-face. There are specific CBT curriculums or strategies for the specific type of anxiety disorder. CBT has similar effectiveness to pharmacotherapy and in a meta analysis, CBT was associated with medium to large benefit effect sizes for GAD, panic disorder and social anxiety disorder. CBT has low dropout rates and its positive effects have been shown to be maintained at least for 12 months. CBT is sometimes given as once weekly sessions for 8–20 weeks, but regimens vary widely. Booster sessions may need to be restarted for patients who have a relapse of symptoms.

Exposure and response prevention (ERP) has been found effective for treating OCD.

Mindfulness-based programs also appear to be effective for managing anxiety disorders. It is unclear if meditation has an effect on anxiety, and transcendental meditation appears to be no different from other types of meditation.

A 2015 Cochrane review of Morita therapy for anxiety disorder in adults found not enough evidence to draw a conclusion.

===Medications===
First-line choices for medications include SSRIs or SNRIs to treat generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder or panic disorder. For adults, there is no good evidence supporting which specific medication in the SSRI or SNRI class is best for treating anxiety, so cost often drives drug choice. Fluvoxamine is effective in treating a range of anxiety disorders in children and adolescents.
 Fluoxetine, sertraline, and paroxetine can also help with some forms of anxiety in children and adolescents. If the chosen medicine is effective, it is recommended that it be continued for at least a year to potentiate the risk of a relapse.

Benzodiazepines are a second line option for the pharmacologic treatment of anxiety. Benzodiazepines are associated with moderate to high effect sizes with regard to symptom relief and they have an onset usually within 1 week. Clonazepam has a longer half life and may possibly be used as once per day dosing. Benzodiazepines may also be used with SNRIs or SSRIs to initially reduce anxiety symptoms, and they may potentially be continued long term. Benzodiazepines are not a first line pharmacologic treatment of anxiety disorders and they carry risks of physical dependence, psychological dependence, overdose death (especially when combined with opioids), misuse, cognitive impairment, falls and motor vehicle crashes.

Buspirone and pregabalin are second-line treatments for people who do not respond to SSRIs or SNRIs. Pregabalin and gabapentin are effective in treating some anxiety disorders, but there is concern regarding their off-label use due to the lack of strong scientific evidence for their efficacy in multiple conditions and their proven side effects.

Medications need to be used with care among older adults, who are more likely to have side effects because of coexisting physical disorders. Adherence problems are more likely among older people, who may have difficulty understanding, seeing, or remembering instructions.

In general, medications are not seen as helpful for specific phobias, but benzodiazepines are sometimes used to help resolve acute episodes. In 2007, data were sparse for the efficacy of any drug.

===Lifestyle and diet===
Lifestyle changes include exercise, for which there is moderate evidence for some improvement, regularizing sleep patterns, reducing caffeine intake, and stopping smoking. Stopping smoking has benefits for anxiety as great as or greater than those of medications. A meta-analysis found 2000 mg/day or more of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as fish oil, tended to reduce anxiety in placebo-controlled and uncontrolled studies, particularly in people with more significant symptoms.

===Cannabis===
, there is little evidence for the use of cannabis in treating anxiety disorders.

===Treatments for children ===
Both therapy and a number of medications have been found to be useful for treating childhood anxiety disorders. Therapy is generally preferred to medication.

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a good first-line therapy approach. Studies have gathered substantial evidence for treatments that are not CBT-based as effective forms of treatment, expanding treatment options for those who do not respond to CBT. Although studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of CBT for anxiety disorders in children and adolescents, evidence that it is more effective than treatment as usual, medication, or wait list controls is inconclusive. Like adults, children may undergo psychotherapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, or counseling. Family therapy is a form of treatment in which the child meets with a therapist together with the primary guardians and siblings. Each family member may attend individual therapy, but family therapy is typically a form of group therapy. Art and play therapy are also used. Art therapy is most commonly used when the child will not or cannot verbally communicate due to trauma or a disability in which they are nonverbal. Participating in art activities allows the child to express what they otherwise may not be able to communicate to others. In play therapy, the child is allowed to play however they please as a therapist observes them. The therapist may intercede from time to time with a question, comment, or suggestion. This is often most effective when the family of the child plays a role in the treatment.

==Epidemiology==
Globally, as of 2010, approximately 273 million (4.5% of the population) had an anxiety disorder. It is more common in females (5.2%) than males (2.8%).

In Europe, Africa, and Asia, lifetime rates of anxiety disorders are between 9 and 16%, and yearly rates are between 4 and 7%. In the United States, the lifetime prevalence of anxiety disorders is about 29%, and between 11 and 18% of adults have the condition in a given year. This difference is affected by the range of ways in which different cultures interpret anxiety symptoms and what they consider to be normative behavior. In general, anxiety disorders represent the most prevalent psychiatric condition in the United States, outside of substance use disorder.

Like adults, children can experience anxiety disorders; between 10 and 20 percent of all children will develop a full-fledged anxiety disorder prior to the age of 18, making anxiety the most common mental health issue in young people. Anxiety disorders in children are often more challenging to identify than their adult counterparts, owing to the difficulty many parents face in discerning them from normal childhood fears. Likewise, anxiety in children is sometimes misdiagnosed as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or, due to the tendency of children to interpret their emotions physically (as stomachaches, headaches, etc.), anxiety disorders may initially be confused with physical ailments.

Anxiety in children has a variety of causes; sometimes anxiety is rooted in biology and may be a product of another existing condition, such as autism spectrum disorder. Gifted children are also often more prone to excessive anxiety than non-gifted children. Other cases of anxiety arise from the child having experienced a traumatic event of some kind, and in some cases, the cause of the child&#x27;s anxiety cannot be pinpointed.

Anxiety in children tends to manifest along age-appropriate themes, such as fear of going to school (not related to bullying) or not performing well enough at school, fear of social rejection, fear of something happening to loved ones, etc. What separates disordered anxiety from normal childhood anxiety is the duration and intensity of the fears involved.

According to 2011 study, people who high in hypercompetitive traits are at increased risk of both anxiety and depression.

<text>Fixed-odds betting is a form of gambling where individuals place bets on the outcome of an event, such as sports matches or horse races, at predetermined odds. In fixed-odds betting, the odds are fixed and determined at the time of placing the bet. These odds reflect the likelihood of a particular outcome occurring. If the bettor&#x27;s prediction is correct, they receive a payout based on the fixed odds. This means that the potential winnings are known at the time of placing the bet, regardless of any changes in the odds leading up to the event.

Fixed-odds gambling involves placing bets on events with predetermined odds. Bookmakers aim to create an overground, where the sum of probabilities quoted for all possible outcomes exceeds 100%, ensuring profit. Imbalanced books can occur, leading to higher or lower payouts than expected. The advent of the internet and betting exchanges has led to opportunities for fixed-odds arbitrage actions and Dutch books.

When a bet has a positive expected value, it is said to be getting &quot;the best of it.&quot; In contrast, &quot;laying odds&quot; refers to a bet in which more is risked than can be won, and rational bettors only engage in this type of bet if the chances of an adverse outcome are low enough. &quot;Lay betting&quot; is when a bettor bets against a specific outcome, effectively taking on the role of a bookmaker.

Odds can be expressed in various formats, including fractional, decimal, and moneyline. Fractional odds are used primarily in the United Kingdom and Ireland, while decimal odds are favored in Continental Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. Moneyline odds are used in the United States. Converting between these formats requires specific calculations depending on the type of odds used.

==Calculating fixed odds==
It is customary with fixed-odds gambling to know the odds at the time of the placement of the wager (the &quot;live price&quot;), but the category also includes wagers whose price is determined only when the race or game starts (the &quot;starting prices&quot;). It is ideal for bookmakers to price/mark up a book such that the net outcome will always be in their favour: the sum of the probabilities quoted for all possible outcomes will be in excess of 100%. The excess over 100% (or overround) represents profit to the bookmaker in the event of a balanced/even book. In the more usual case of an imbalanced book, the bookmaker may have to pay out more winnings than what is staked or may earn more than mathematically expected. An imbalanced book may arise since there is no way for a bookmaker to know the true probabilities for the outcome of competitions left to human effort or to predict the bets that will be attracted from others by fixed odds compiled on the basis personal view and knowledge.

With the advent of Internet and bet exchange betting, the possibility of fixed-odds arbitrage actions and Dutch books against bookmakers and exchanges has expanded significantly. Betting exchanges in particular act like a stock exchange, allowing the odds to be set in the course of trading between individual bettors, usually leading to quoted odds that are reasonably close to the &quot;true odds&quot;.

===&quot;The best of it&quot;===
In making a bet where the expected value is positive, one is said to be getting &quot;the best of it&quot;. For example, if one were to bet $1 at 10 to 1 odds (one could win $10) on the outcome of a coin flip, one would be getting &quot;the best of it&quot; and should always make the bet (assuming a rational and risk-neutral attitude with linear utility curves and have no preferences implying loss aversion or the like). However, if someone offered odds of 10 to 1 that a card chosen at random from a regular 52 card deck would be the ace of spades, one would be getting &quot;the worst of it&quot; because the chance is only 1 in 52 that the ace will be chosen.

In an entry for &quot;L&#x27;Encyclopédie&quot; (the Enlightenment-era &quot;French Encyclopedia&quot;), Denis Diderot cites a similar example in which two players, Player A and Player B, wager over a game of dice that involves rolling two six-sided dice. Player A wins if the dice add up to 12, of which there is only one possible case. Player B wins if the dice fall in any other combination, of which there are 35 possibilities. It is mathematically disadvantageous to make a bet if one gets &quot;the worst of it&quot;. Accordingly, for the bet to be &quot;fair&quot;, the amount each player could potentially lose or gain from the wager should be adjusted, depending on the odds of their success.

===Laying odds===
When making a bet in which one must put more at risk than one can win, one is &quot;&quot;. Rational bettors will do so only if the actual chances of an adverse outcome are low enough that the expected outcome even after deduction of taxes and any transaction costs is favorable to the person placing the bet. For example, if one bets $1,000 that it will rain tomorrow and can win only $200 but can lose the entire $1,000, one is laying odds that will rain tomorrow. Laying odds is reflected in the expression &quot;[I would] &quot; – with which the speaker is expressing a willingness to risk losing something of value in exchange for something worthless, because winning that bet is a certainty.

===Lay betting===
&quot;Lay betting&quot; is a bet that something will &quot;not happen&quot;, so &quot;laying $50 on a horse&quot; is betting the horse will &quot;not&quot; win. Bookmakers sell bets based on the odds of a specific outcome, but lay betting allows the bettor (in some English-speaking countries, the &quot;punter&quot;) to reverse roles with the bookmaker, using odds to sell the opposite outcome to the bookmaker. In this context, &quot;lay&quot; is used in the sense of &quot;layman&quot;, i.e., a bet sold by someone who does not sell bets professionally. 

==Types of odds offered==
There are three widely used means of quoting odds:

===Fractional odds===
Favoured by bookmakers in the United Kingdom and Ireland and common in horse racing, fractional odds quote the net total that will be paid out to the winning bettor relative to the stake. The term &quot;fractional odds&quot; is something of a misnomer, especially when visually reinforced by using a slash (as opposed to, &quot;e.g.&quot;, a colon or the word &quot;to&quot; or &quot;on&quot;) to separate a potential gain from the amount that a bettor must wager in order to receive it upon a win, because the &quot;fraction&quot; in question represents not the odds of winning or even the reciprocal of the odds of winning but rather the fraction (for any odds longer than &quot;even money&quot; or chances of winning less than 50%, an improper fraction) of the amount at stake that the upside outcome represents. This fraction may be derived by subtracting 1 from the reciprocal of the chances of winning; for any odds longer than &quot;even money,&quot; this fraction will be an improper one. Odds of 4:1 (&quot;four-to-one&quot; or less commonly &quot;four-to-one &quot;against&quot;&quot;) would imply that the bettor stands to make a £400 profit on a £100 stake. If the odds are 1:4 (read &quot;one-to-four&quot;, or alternatively &quot;four-to-one &quot;on&quot;&quot; or &quot;four-to-one &quot;in favor&quot;&quot;), the bettor stands to make £25 on a £100 stake. In either case, &quot;against&quot; or &quot;on&quot;, should he win, the bettor always receives his original stake back, so if the odds are 4:1 the bettor receives a total of £500 (£400 plus the original £100). Odds of 1/1 are known as &quot;evens&quot; or &quot;even money&quot;.

Not all fractional odds are traditionally read using the lowest common denominator. Perhaps most unusual is that odds of 10:3 are read as &quot;one-hundred-to-thirty&quot;.

Fractional odds are also known as &quot;British odds&quot;, &quot;UK odds&quot;, or, in that country, &quot;traditional odds&quot;.

===Decimal odds===
Favoured in Continental Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Canada, decimal odds differ from fractional odds by taking into account that the bettor must first part with their stake to make a bet; the figure quoted, therefore, is the winning amount that would be paid out to the bettor. Therefore, the decimal odds of an outcome are equivalent to one plus the decimal value of the fractional odds; in the absence of built-in house advantage to cover overhead, profit margins, or (for an illegal enterprise) compensation for the fact that both chances of prosecution and penalties in the event of conviction tend to be higher for bookmakers than for clients, the decimal odds associated with a given outcome would be the decimal expression of the reciprocal of what the offering party assesses to be the outcome&#x27;s chance of occurring. Thus, even odds 1/1 are quoted in decimal odds as 2. The 4/1 fractional odds discussed above are quoted as 5, while the 1/4 odds are quoted as 1.25. It is considered to be ideal for parlay betting because the odds to be paid out are simply the product of the odds for each outcome wagered on.

Decimal odds are also known as &quot;European odds&quot;, &quot;digital odds&quot; or &quot;continental odds&quot; and tend to be favoured by betting exchanges because they are the easiest to work with for trading, in this case the purchase and sale of upside and downside risk.

===Moneyline odds===
Moneyline odds are favoured by United States bookmakers and as such, are sometimes called &quot;American odds&quot;. There are two possibilities: the figure quote can be either positive or negative. Moneyline refers to odds on the straight-up outcome of a game with no consideration to a point spread.

;Positive figures
:If the figure quoted is positive, the odds are quoting how much money will be won on a $100 wager (done if the odds are better than even). Fractional odds of 4/1 would be quoted as +400, while fractional odds of 1/4 cannot be quoted as a positive figure.

;Negative figures
:If the figure quoted is negative, the moneyline odds are quoting how much money must be wagered to win $100 (this is done if the odds are worse than even). Fractional odds of 1/4 would be quoted as −400 while fractional odds of 4/1 cannot be quoted as a negative figure.

;Even odds
:Even odds are quoted as +100 or −100. Some but not all bookmakers display the positive symbol.

== Odds conversion ==
To convert fractional odds to decimal, take the fractional number, convert it to decimal by doing the division, and then add 1. For example, the 4-to-1 fractional odds shown above is the same as 5 in decimal odds, while 1-to-4 would be quoted as 1.25.

The method for converting moneyline to decimal odds depends on whether the moneyline value is positive or negative. If the moneyline is positive, it is divided by 100 and add 1. Thus, +400 moneyline is the same as 5.0 in decimal odds. If the moneyline is negative, 100 is divided by the absolute moneyline amount (the minus signed is removed), and then 1 is added. For example, −400 moneyline is 100/400 + 1, or 1.25, in decimal odds.
