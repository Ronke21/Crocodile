<text>The Adirondack Mountains ( ) are a massif of mountains in Northeastern New York which form a circular dome approximately wide and covering about . The region contains more than 100 peaks, including Mount Marcy, which is the highest point in New York at . The Adirondack High Peaks, a traditional list of 46 peaks over , are popular hiking destinations. There are over 200 named lakes with the number of smaller lakes, ponds, and other bodies of water reaching over 3,000. Among the named lakes around the mountains are Lake George, Lake Placid, and Lake Tear of the Clouds. The region has over of river.

Although the mountains are formed from ancient rocks more than 1 billion years old, geologically, the mountains are relatively young and were created during recent periods of glaciation. Because of this, the Adirondacks have been referred to as &quot;new mountains from old rocks.&quot; It is theorized that there is a hotspot beneath the region, which causes continued uplift at the rate of annually.

The Adirondack mountain range has such unusual characteristics compared to the area around it that it is divided into its own province within the Appalachian Highlands physiographic division. It is bounded by three other provinces: the St. Lawrence (Champlain) on the north, northeast; the Appalachian Plateau to the south, southwest; and the Valley and Ridge to the southeast.

The entire region lies within Adirondack Park, a New York state protected area of over . The park was established in 1892 by the state legislature to protect the region&#x27;s natural resources and to provide recreational opportunities for the public. It covers over 20 percent of New York state&#x27;s land area.

== Etymology ==
The word Adirondack is thought to come from the Mohawk word meaning &quot;eaters of trees&quot;. The earliest written use of the name was in 1635 by Harmen Meyndertsz van den Bogaert in his Mohawk to Dutch glossary, found in his &quot;Journey into Mohawk Country&quot;. He spelled it &quot;Adirondakx&quot; and said that it stood for Frenchmen, meaning the Algonquians who allied with the French. Another early use of the name, spelled &quot;Rontaks&quot;, was in 1729 by French missionary Joseph-François Lafitau. He explained that the word was used by the Iroquois as a derogatory term for groups of Algonquians who did not practice agriculture and therefore sometimes had to eat tree bark to survive harsh winters.

The Mohawks had no written language, so Europeans used various phonetic spellings of the word, including &quot;Achkokx&quot;, &quot;Rondaxe&quot;, and &quot;Adirondax.&quot; Such words were strongly associated with the region, but they were not yet considered a place name; an English map from 1761 labels the area simply &quot;Deer Hunting Country&quot;. In 1838, the mountains were named &quot;Adirondacks&quot; by Ebenezer Emmons, the State Geologist for the northern New York State Geological District.

== History ==

The first humans to live in the Adirondacks were Paleo-Indians who arrived around the 14th millennium BC following the end of the Last Glacial Period. The earliest migrants arrived from the St. Lawrence River Valley to the north, and settled along the shores of the Champlain Sea. During the Archaic Period (8000–1000 BC) this semi-nomadic hunter-gatherer Laurentian culture inhabited the Adirondacks; evidence of their presence includes a projectile point of red-brown chert found in 2007 at the edge of Tupper Lake.

During an interval of roughly 11,000 years following the end of the Last Glacial Period, the climate of the Adirondacks gradually warmed, with the area&#x27;s tundra being replaced by forests that were now able to grow. During the transition between the Archaic and Woodland (1000 BCAD 1000) periods, multiple different groups replaced the Laurentian culture—including the Sylvan Lake, River, Middlesex, Point Peninsula, and Owasco cultures. By the time of the Owasco culture , maize and beans were being cultivated in the uplands of the Adirondacks.

The first Iroquoian peoples, the Mohawk (or Kanyengehaga) and the Oneida (or Oneyotdehaga), arrived in the Adirondack region between 4,000 and 1,200 years ago. Both groups claimed the Adirondack Mountains as hunting grounds. According to Haudenosaunee historian Rick Hill, the region was considered a &#x27;Dish with One Spoon,&#x27; symbolizing shared hunting resources between the groups. A group of Algonquian people, known as the Mahicans, also occupied the region, particularly the Hudson River Valley.

These were the groups that the first European explorers of the area encountered. European presence in the area began with a battle between Samuel de Champlain and a group of Mohawks, in what is now Ticonderoga in 1609. The Jesuit missionary Isaac Jogues became the first recorded European to travel through the center of the Adirondacks, as the captive of a Mohawk hunting party, in 1642.

The early European perception of the Adirondacks was of a vast, inhospitable wilderness. One map of the area from 1771 shows the region as a blank space in the northeastern corner of New York. In 1784, Thomas Pownhall wrote that the Native Americans referred to the area as &quot;the Dismal Wilderness, or the Habitation of Winter,&quot; and that the area was &quot;either not much known to them, or, if known, very wisely by them kept from the Knowledge of the Europeans.&quot; He clearly had the impression that native people did not live within the Adirondack mountains.

Because local Iroquoian and Algonquian tribes had been decimated first by smallpox and measles in the 1600s, then by wars with encroaching European settlers, there likely were very few people living in the region by the time Pownhall wrote his description. It is only relatively recently that numerous archaeological finds have definitively shown that Native Americans were indeed very present in the Adirondacks before European contact, hunting, making pottery, and practicing agriculture.

The European impression of a wild region devoid of human connection set up a narrative about wilderness that would persist through the next 200-some years of the region&#x27;s history. While society&#x27;s perception of the Adirondacks&#x27; value changed, they were always seen as a land of natural resources and physical beauty, not of human history. First the area was an inhospitable tangle, then a lucrative store of lumber. After the American Revolutionary War, New York State gained ownership of most of the land in the region.

Needing money to discharge war debts, the government sold nearly all the original public acreage about 7 million acres for pennies an acre. Lumbermen were welcomed to the interior, with few restraints, resulting in massive deforestation. Later, the wilderness character of the region became popular with the rise of the Romantic movement, and the Adirondacks became a destination for those wishing to escape the evils of city life. Rising concern over water quality and deforestation led to the creation of the Adirondack Park in 1885. In 1989, part of the Adirondack region was designated by UNESCO as the Champlain-Adirondack Biosphere Reserve.

== Geology ==

The rocks of the Adirondack mountains originated about two billion years ago as 50,000 feet (ca. 15,240 m) thick sediments at the bottom of a sea located near the equator. Because of plate tectonics these collided with Laurentia (the precursor of modern North America) in a mountain building episode known as the Grenville orogeny. During this time the sedimentary rock was changed into metamorphic rock. It is these Proterozoic minerals and lithologies that make up the core of the massif. Minerals of interest include:
* wollastonite, mined near Harrisville
* magnetite and hematite, formerly mined at the Benson Mines, Lyon Mountain, Mineville, Tahawus, and Witherbee.
* graphite, mined near Hague and Ticonderoga.
* garnet, mined at the Barton Mine, north of Gore Mountain.
* anorthosite, visible in road cuts on the New York State Route 3 between Saranac Lake and Tupper Lake.
* marble
* zinc: The Balmat-Edwards district on the northwest flank of the massif also in St. Lawrence County was a major zinc ore deposit
* titanium was mined at Tahawus.

The Adirondacks are uplifted by a hot spot in the Canadian Shield in contrast to other mountain ranges in New York which are a part of the Appalachian chain (not to be confused with the cultural region of Appalachia).

Around 600 million years ago, as Laurentia drifted away from Baltica (European Craton), the area began to be pulled apart forming the Iapetus Ocean. Faults developed, running north to northeast which formed valleys and deep lakes. Examples visible today include the grabens Lake George and Schroon Lake. By this time the Grenville mountains had been eroded away and the area was covered by a shallow sea. Several thousand feet of sediment accumulated on the sea bed. Trilobites were the principal life-form of the sea bed, and fossil tracks can be seen in the Potsdam sandstone floor of the Paul Smiths Visitor Interpretive Center.

About 10 million years ago, the region began to be uplifted. It has been lifted about 7000 feet (ca. 2,134 meters) and is continuing at about 2 millimeters per year, which is greater than the rate of denudation. The cause of the uplift is unknown, but geologists theorize that it is caused by a hot spot in the Earth&#x27;s crust. A recent study has revealed a column of seismically slow materials about 50–80 km deep beneath the Adirondack Mountains, which was interpreted to be the upwelling asthenosphere contributing to the uplift of the mountains. The occurrence of earthquake swarms near the center of the massif at Blue Mountain Lake may be evidence of this. Some of the earthquakes have exceeded 5 on the Richter magnitude scale.

Starting about 2.5 million years ago, a cycle of Pleistocene glacial and interglacial periods began which covered the area in ice. During the most recent episode, the Laurentide Ice Sheet covered most of northern North America between about 95,000 and c. 20,000 years ago. After this the climate warmed, but it took nearly 10,000 years for a 10,000 feet (ca. 3,048 m) thick layer of ice to completely melt. Evidence of this period includes:
* Eskers: the Rainbow Lake esker bisects the eponymous lake and extends discontinuously for 85 miles (ca. 137 km). Another long discontinuous esker extends from Mountain Pond through Keese Mill, passing between Upper St. Regis Lake and the Spectacle Ponds, and continuing to Ochre, Fish, and Lydia Ponds in the St. Regis Canoe Area. A 150-foot-high esker bisects the Five Ponds Wilderness Area.
* Glacial erratics: there is a large one at the Newcomb Visitor Information Center next to the Rich Lake Trail.
* Kames
* Moraines
* The cirques that characterize the Whiteface Mountain.
* Outwash plains: St. Regis Canoe Area is an outwash plain pitted with kettle holes.

Soils in the area are generally thin, sandy, acidic, and infertile, having developed since the glacial retreat.

== Climate ==
The climate is strongly continental, with high humidity and precipitation year-round. The Adirondacks typically experience pleasantly warm, rainy weather in the summer (June–August), with temperatures in the range of , cooler than the rest of New York State due to the higher elevation. Summer evenings in the Adirondacks are chilly, with temperatures ranging on average between . Winters (December–March) are long, cold, snowy and harsh, with temperatures ranging from . Winter nights are frigid, with temperatures between . Spring (April–May) and fall (September–November) are short transitional seasons. 
== Ecology ==

The Adirondack Mountains form the southernmost part of the Eastern forest-boreal transition ecoregion. They are heavily forested, and contain one of the southernmost distributions of the taiga ecotype in North America. The forests of the Adirondacks include spruce, pine and deciduous trees. Lumbering, once an important industry, has been much restricted by the creation of state forest preserve.

The mountains include many wetlands, of which there are three kinds:
* swamps, any wetland including trees and shrubs.
* marshes, wetlands with water stagnation. These may support bullfrogs, spring peepers, spotted salamanders, great blue herons, American bitterns, and painted turtles. Pickerel weed often forms large colonies.
* bogs, characterized by plants like sphagnum moss, orchids, and pitcher plants.

Breeding birds include northern forest specialists not found anywhere else in the state, such as boreal chickadees, Canada jays, spruce grouse, black-backed woodpeckers, common loons and crossbills. Mammals include raccoons, beavers, river otters, bobcats, moose, black bears, and coyotes. Extirpated or extinct mammals that formerly roamed the Adirondacks include the eastern cougar, eastern elk, wolverine, caribou, eastern wolf, and the Canada lynx. Attempted reintroductions of elk and lynx in the 20th century failed for numerous reasons, including poaching, vehicle collisions, and conservation incompetence.

Nearly 60 percent of the park is covered with northern hardwood forest. Above , conditions are too poor for hardwoods to thrive, and the trees become mixed with or replaced by balsam fir and red spruce. Above black spruce replace red. Higher still, only trees short enough to be covered in snow during the winter can survive.

A small area on the highest peaks exists above the tree line and has an alpine climate. These areas are covered by plants which occupied a large lowland tundra following the most recent period of glaciation. The amount of area covered by this ecosystem changes from year to year due to local climate changes, and has been estimated to only cover between . The alpine ecosystem is considered extremely fragile, and was damaged by hikers prior to a 1970s campaign by the Adirondack Mountain Club to preserve it.

<doc id="54985" wikidata="Q49001" url="?curid=54985" title="Whoopi Goldberg">
<text>Caryn Elaine Johnson (born November 13, 1955), known professionally as Whoopi Goldberg (), is an American actor, comedian, author, and television personality. The recipient of numerous accolades, she is one of few people to receive an Emmy Award, Grammy Award, Academy Award, and Tony Award, collectively known as the EGOT. In 2001, she received the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor.

Goldberg began her career on stage in 1983 with her one-woman show, &quot;Spook Show&quot;, which transferred to Broadway under the title &quot;Whoopi Goldberg&quot;, running from 1984 to 1985. She won a Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album for the recording of the show. Her film breakthrough came in 1985 with her role as Celie, a mistreated woman in the Deep South, in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s period drama film &quot;The Color Purple&quot;, for which she won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama. For her role as an eccentric psychic in the romantic fantasy film &quot;Ghost&quot; (1990), she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress and a second Golden Globe Award. She starred in the comedy &quot;Sister Act&quot; (1992) and its sequel &quot;Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit&quot; (1993), becoming the highest-paid actress at the time. She also acted in &quot;Jumpin&#x27; Jack Flash&quot; (1986), &quot;Clara&#x27;s Heart&quot; (1988), &quot;Soapdish&quot; (1991), &quot;Ghosts of Mississippi&quot; (1996), and &quot;Till&quot; (2022). She also voiced roles in &quot;The Lion King&quot; (1994) and &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; (2010).

On stage, Goldberg has starred in the Broadway revivals of Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s musical &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum&quot; and August Wilson&#x27;s play &quot;Ma Rainey&#x27;s Black Bottom&quot;. She won a Tony Award as a producer of the musical &quot;Thoroughly Modern Millie&quot;. In 2011 she received her third Tony Award nomination for the stage adaptation of &quot;Sister Act&quot; (2011). On television, Goldberg portrayed Guinan in the science fiction series &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; (1988–1993), and &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot; (2022). Since 2007, she has co-hosted and moderated the daytime talk show &quot;The View&quot;, for which she won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Talk Show Host. She has hosted the Academy Awards ceremony four times.

==Early life==
Caryn Elaine Johnson was born in Manhattan, New York City, on November 13, 1955, the daughter of Emma Johnson (née Harris), a nurse and teacher, and Robert James Johnson Jr., a Baptist clergyman. She was raised in a public housing project, the Chelsea-Elliot Houses, in New York City.

Goldberg described her mother as a &quot;stern, strong, and wise woman&quot; who raised her as a single mother with her brother Clyde ( – 2015). She attended a local Catholic school, St Columba&#x27;s. Her more recent forebears migrated north from Faceville, Georgia; Palatka, Florida; and Virginia. She dropped out of Washington Irving High School.

She has stated that her stage forename (&quot;Whoopi&quot;) was taken from a whoopee cushion: &quot;When you&#x27;re performing on stage, you never really have time to go into the bathroom and close the door. So if you get a little gassy, you&#x27;ve got to let it go. So people used to say to me, &#x27;You&#x27;re like a whoopee cushion.&#x27; And that&#x27;s where the name came from.&quot;

About her stage surname, she claimed in 2011, &quot;My mother did not name me Whoopi, but Goldberg is my name—it&#x27;s part of my family, part of my heritage, just like being black,&quot; and &quot;I just know I am Jewish. I practice nothing. I don&#x27;t go to temple, but I do remember the holidays.&quot; She has stated that &quot;people would say &#x27;Come on, are you Jewish?&#x27; And I always say &#x27;Would you ask me that if I was white? I bet not.&#x27;&quot; One account suggests that her mother, Emma Johnson, thought the family&#x27;s original surname was &quot;not Jewish enough&quot; for her daughter to become a star. Goldberg has said that her family is &quot;Jewish, Buddhist, Baptist, and Catholic.&quot;

Researcher Henry Louis Gates Jr. found that all of Goldberg&#x27;s traceable ancestors were black, that she had no known German or Jewish ancestry, and that none of her ancestors were named Goldberg. Results of a DNA test, revealed in the 2006 PBS documentary &quot;African American Lives&quot;, traced part of her ancestry to the Papel and Bayote people of modern-day Guinea-Bissau of West Africa. The show identified her great-great-grandparents as William and Elsie Washington, who had acquired property in northern Florida in 1873, and mentions they were among a very small number of black people who became landowners through homesteading in the years following the Civil War. The show also mentions that her grandparents were living in Harlem, and that her grandfather was working as a Pullman porter.

According to an anecdote told by Nichelle Nichols in &quot;Trekkies&quot; (1997), a young Goldberg was watching &quot;Star Trek&quot;, and on seeing Nichols&#x27; character Uhura, exclaimed, &quot;Momma! There&#x27;s a black lady on television and she ain&#x27;t no maid!&quot; This spawned Goldberg&#x27;s lifelong &quot;Star Trek&quot; fandom. Goldberg lobbied for and was eventually cast in a recurring guest starring role as Guinan on &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;.

In the 1970s, Goldberg moved to San Diego, California, where she became a waitress, then to Berkeley, where she worked odd jobs, including as a bank teller, a mortuary cosmetologist, and a bricklayer. She joined the avant-garde theater troupe the Blake Street Hawkeyes and gave comedy and acting classes; Courtney Love was one of her acting students. Goldberg was also in a number of theater productions. In 1978, she witnessed a midair collision of two planes in San Diego, causing her to develop a fear of flying and post-traumatic stress disorder.

==Career==
===1980–1985: Early work and breakthrough ===
Goldberg trained under acting teacher Uta Hagen at the HB Studio in New York City. She first appeared onscreen in &quot;&quot; (1982), an avant-garde ensemble feature by San Francisco filmmaker William Farley.

In 1983 and 1984, she &quot;first came to national prominence with her one-woman show&quot; in which she portrayed Moms Mabley, &quot;Moms&quot;, first performed in Berkeley, California, and then at the Victoria Theatre in San Francisco; the Oakland Museum of California preserves a poster advertising the show.

She created &quot;The Spook Show&quot;, a one-woman show composed of different character monologues in 1983. Director Mike Nichols &quot;discovered&quot; her when he saw her perform. In an interview, he recalled that he &quot;burst into tears&quot;, and that he and Goldberg &quot;fell into each other&#x27;s arms&quot; when they first met backstage. Goldberg considered Nichols her mentor. Nichols helped her transfer the show to Broadway, where it was retitled &quot;Whoopi Goldberg&quot;. The show ran from October 24, 1984, to March 10, 1985, and was taped and broadcast by HBO as &quot;Whoopi Goldberg: Direct from Broadway.&quot; The recording of the special was awarded the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album, making Goldberg the first Black female comedian to win the Grammy.

Goldberg&#x27;s Broadway performance caught the eye of director Steven Spielberg while she performed in The Belly Room at The Comedy Store. Spielberg gave her the lead role in his film &quot;The Color Purple&quot;, based on the novel by Alice Walker. It was released in late 1985, and was a critical and commercial success. Film critic Roger Ebert described Goldberg&#x27;s performance as &quot;one of the most amazing debut performances in movie history&quot;. It was nominated for 11 Academy Awards, including a nomination for Goldberg as Best Actress. She won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama for her portrayal of Celie, becoming the first Black actress to win in this category.

=== 1986–1999: Film stardom ===

Between 1985 and 1988, Goldberg was the busiest female star, making seven films. She starred in Penny Marshall&#x27;s directorial debut &quot;Jumpin&#x27; Jack Flash&quot; (1986) and began a relationship with David Claessen, a director of photography on the set; they married later that year. The film was a modest success, and during the next two years, three additional motion pictures featured Goldberg: &quot;Burglar&quot; (1987), &quot;Fatal Beauty&quot; (1987), and &quot;The Telephone&quot; (1988). Though they were not as successful, Goldberg garnered awards from the NAACP Image Awards. Goldberg and Claessen divorced after the poor box office performance of &quot;The Telephone&quot;, in which she was contracted to perform. She tried unsuccessfully to sue the film&#x27;s producers. &quot;Clara&#x27;s Heart&quot; (1988) did poorly at the box office, though her own performance was critically acclaimed.

As the 1980s concluded, she hosted numerous HBO specials of &quot;Comic Relief&quot; with fellow comedians Robin Williams and Billy Crystal. In January 1990, Goldberg starred with Jean Stapleton in the situation comedy &quot;Bagdad Cafe&quot; (inspired by the 1987 film of the same name). The sitcom ran for two seasons on CBS. Simultaneously, she starred in &quot;The Long Walk Home&quot;, portraying a woman in the US civil rights movement. She played a psychic in the film &quot;Ghost&quot; (1990) and became the first black woman to win the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress in nearly 50 years, and the second black woman to win an Academy Award for acting (the first being Hattie McDaniel for &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; in 1940). She also won the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role and the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture. &quot;Premiere&quot; named her character Oda Mae Brown in its list of Top 100 best film characters.

Goldberg starred in &quot;Soapdish&quot; (1991) and had a recurring role on &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; between 1988 and 1993 as Guinan, a character she reprised in two &quot;Star Trek&quot; films. She made a cameo in the Traveling Wilburys 1991 music video &quot;Wilbury Twist&quot;. On May 29, 1992, the film &quot;Sister Act&quot; was released. It grossed well over US$200 million (equivalent to $ million in ), and Goldberg was nominated for a Golden Globe Award. That year, she starred in &quot;The Player&quot; and &quot;Sarafina!&quot;. She also hosted the 34th Annual Grammy Awards, receiving praise from the &quot;Sun-Sentinel&quot;″s Deborah Wilker for bringing to life what Wilker considered &quot;stodgy and stale&quot; ceremonies. During the next year, Goldberg hosted a late-night talk show, &quot;The Whoopi Goldberg Show&quot;, and starred in two more films: &quot;Made in America&quot; and &quot;Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit&quot;. With an estimated salary of $7–12 million for &quot;Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit&quot; (1993), she was the highest-paid actress at the time. From 1994 to 1995, she appeared in &quot;Corrina, Corrina&quot;, &quot;The Lion King&quot; (voice), &quot;Theodore Rex&quot;, &quot;The Little Rascals&quot;, &quot;The Pagemaster&quot; (voice), &quot;Boys on the Side&quot;, and &quot;Moonlight and Valentino&quot;, and guest-starred on &quot;Muppets Tonight&quot; in 1996.
In 1994, Goldberg became the first black woman to host the Academy Awards ceremony starting with the 66th Oscar telecast. She hosted it again in 1996, 1999, and 2002, and has been regarded as one of the show&#x27;s best hosts. Goldberg starred in four motion pictures in 1996: &quot;Bogus&quot; (with Gérard Depardieu and Haley Joel Osment), &quot;Eddie&quot;, &quot;The Associate&quot; (with Dianne Wiest), and &quot;Ghosts of Mississippi&quot; (with Alec Baldwin and James Woods). During the filming of &quot;Eddie&quot;, she began dating co-star Frank Langella, a relationship that lasted until early 2000. In October 1997, she and ghostwriter Daniel Paisner cowrote &quot;Book&quot;, a collection featuring Goldberg&#x27;s insights and opinions. Also in 1996, Goldberg replaced Nathan Lane as Pseudolus in the Broadway revival of Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s musical comedy &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum&quot;. Greg Evans of &quot;Variety&quot; regarded her &quot;thoroughly modern style&quot; as &quot;a welcome invitation to a new audience that could find this 1962 musical as dated as ancient Rome&quot;. &quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s Chip Crews deemed Goldberg &quot;a pip and a pro&quot;, and that she &quot;ultimately [...] steers the show past its rough spots&quot;.

From 1998 to 2001, Goldberg took supporting roles in &quot;How Stella Got Her Groove Back&quot; with Angela Bassett, &quot;Girl, Interrupted&quot; with Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie, &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;, and &quot;Rat Race&quot; with an all-star ensemble cast. She starred in the ABC-TV versions of &quot;Cinderella&quot;, &quot;A Knight in Camelot&quot;, and &quot;Call Me Claus&quot;. In 1998 she gained a new audience when she became the &quot;Center Square&quot; on &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;, hosted by Tom Bergeron. She also served as executive producer, for which she was nominated for four Emmy Awards. She left the series in 2002. In 1999, she voiced Ransome in the British animated children&#x27;s show &quot;Foxbusters&quot; by Cosgrove Hall Films. AC Nielsen EDI ranked her as the actress appearing in the most theatrical films in the 1990s, with 29 films grossing $1.3 billion in the U.S. and Canada (equivalent to $ billion in ).

===2000–2019: Established actor ===

In 2001, Goldberg hosted the documentary short &quot;The Making of A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot; and later portrayed Death in &quot;Monkeybone&quot;. In 2003, she returned to television in &quot;Whoopi&quot;, which was canceled after one season. On her 46th birthday, she was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. She also appeared alongside Samuel L. Jackson and Angela Bassett in the HBO documentary &quot;Unchained Memories&quot; (2003), narrating slave narratives. During the next two years, she became a spokeswoman for Slim Fast and produced two television series: Lifetime&#x27;s original drama &quot;Strong Medicine&quot;, which ran six seasons; and &quot;Whoopi&#x27;s Littleburg&quot;, a children&#x27;s television series on Nickelodeon. In 2002, Goldberg completed the EGOT (Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony Awards) when she received the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Class Special as a producer of &quot;Beyond Tara: The Extraordinary Life of Hattie McDaniel&quot; and the Tony Award for Best Musical for producing &quot;Thoroughly Modern Millie&quot;. She is the first Black woman to be an EGOT recipient. Goldberg returned to the stage in 2003, starring as blues singer Ma Rainey in the Broadway revival of August Wilson&#x27;s historical drama &quot;Ma Rainey&#x27;s Black Bottom&quot; at the Royale Theatre. She was also one of the show&#x27;s producers.

Goldberg was involved in controversy at a fundraiser for John Kerry at Radio City Music Hall in New York in July 2004 when she made a sexual joke about President George W. Bush by waving a bottle of wine, pointed toward her pubic area, and said, &quot;We should keep &quot;Bush&quot; where he belongs, and not in the White House.&quot; As result, Slim-Fast dropped her from their ad campaign. Later that year, she revived her one-woman show at the Lyceum Theatre on Broadway in honor of its 20th anniversary; Charles Isherwood of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the opening night performance an &quot;intermittently funny but sluggish evening of comic portraiture&quot;. Goldberg made guest appearances on &quot;Everybody Hates Chris&quot; as elderly character Louise Clarkson.

From August 2006 to March 2008, Goldberg hosted &quot;Wake Up with Whoopi&quot;, a nationally syndicated morning radio talk and entertainment program. In October 2007, Goldberg announced on the air that she was going to retire from acting because she was no longer sent scripts, saying, &quot;You know, there&#x27;s no room for the very talented Whoopi. There&#x27;s no room right now in the marketplace of cinema&quot;. On December 13, 2008, she guest starred on &quot;The Naked Brothers Band&quot;, a Nickelodeon rock- mockumentary television series. Before the episode premiered, on February 18, 2008, the band performed on &quot;The View&quot; and the band members were interviewed by Goldberg and Sherri Shepherd. That same year, Goldberg hosted 62nd Tony Awards.
In 2010, she starred in the Tyler Perry movie &quot;For Colored Girls&quot;, alongside Janet Jackson, Phylicia Rashad, Thandie Newton, Loretta Devine, Anika Noni Rose, Kimberly Elise, Kerry Washington, and Macy Gray. The film received generally good reviews from critics and grossed over $38 million worldwide. The same year, she voiced Stretch in the Disney/Pixar animated movie &quot;Toy Story 3&quot;. The movie received critical acclaim and grossed $1.067 billion worldwide. Goldberg had a recurring role on the television series &quot;Glee&quot; during its third and fourth seasons as Carmen Tibideaux, a renowned Broadway performer and opera singer and the dean at a fictional performing arts college NYADA (New York Academy of the Dramatic Arts). In 2011, she had a cameo in &quot;The Muppets&quot;. In 2012, Goldberg guest starred as Jane Marsh, Sue Heck&#x27;s guidance counselor on &quot;The Middle&quot;. She voiced the Magic Mirror on Disney XD&#x27;s &quot;The 7D&quot;. In 2014, she also portrayed a character in the superhero film &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; (2014). She also appeared as herself in Chris Rock&#x27;s &quot;Top Five&quot; and starred in the romantic comedy film &quot;Big Stone Gap&quot;.

In 2016, Goldberg executive produced a reality television series called &quot;Strut&quot;, based on transgender models from the modeling agency Slay Model Management in Los Angeles. The series aired on Oxygen. In 2017, she voiced Ursula, the Sea Witch and Uma&#x27;s mother, in the TV movie &quot;Descendants 2&quot;. In 2018, she starred in the Tyler Perry&#x27;s film &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Fool&quot;, alongside Tiffany Haddish, Omari Hardwick, Mehcad Brooks, Amber Riley, and Tika Sumpter. That same year, she also starred in the comedy-drama film &quot;Furlough&quot;, alongside Tessa Thompson, Melissa Leo, and Anna Paquin. In 2019, Goldberg&#x27;s voice was used for the role of the Giant&#x27;s Wife in the Hollywood Bowl production of &quot;Into the Woods&quot;.

===2020–present===

In an appearance on &quot;The View&quot; on January 22, 2020, Patrick Stewart invited Goldberg to reprise her role as Guinan during the second season of &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;. She immediately accepted his offer. Goldberg also starred in &quot;The Stand&quot;, a CBS All Access miniseries based on the 1978 novel of the same name by Stephen King, portraying Mother Abagail, a 108-year-old woman. In 2020, it was announced Goldberg was set to return in &quot;Sister Act 3&quot; with Tyler Perry producing. The film is slated to debut on Disney+.

Goldberg also stars in the biographical film &quot;Till&quot; (2021), written and directed by Chinonye Chukwu, which she also produced. The film focuses on abduction and lynching of Emmett Till with Goldberg playing Till&#x27;s grandmother, Alma Carthan. The film debuted at the 60th New York Film Festival. Goldberg guest starred on the Disney Channel show &quot;Amphibia&quot; as the character Mother Olms. In 2023, she appeared in a cameo role in the musical film &quot;The Color Purple&quot; playing a midwife.

Goldberg returned to the stage playing Miss Hannigan in the musical &quot;Annie&quot; as part of a limited engagement at The Theater at Madison Square Garden from December 4, 2024 to January 5, 2025. &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised Goldberg&#x27;s performance describing her as a &quot;holiday gift&quot; adding, &quot;In a just sweet enough production with a strong cast, the &quot;View&quot; host delivers a performance that reaffirms her savvy as a comic actor.&quot; Patrick Ryan of &quot;USA Today&quot; agreed writing, &quot;[She] is perfectly prickly and altogether hilarious in her first stage acting role in more than 15 years&quot;.

== Other ventures ==

=== Activism and philanthropy ===
In 2006, Goldberg appeared during the 20th anniversary of &quot;Comic Relief&quot;. Goldberg is an advocate for human rights, moderating a panel at the Alliance of Youth Movements Summit on how social networks can be used to fight violent extremism in 2008, and also moderating a panel at the UN on human rights, children and armed conflict, terrorism, and reconciliation in 2009. On an episode of &quot;The View&quot; that aired on May 9, 2012, Goldberg stated she is a member of the National Rifle Association of America.

On April 1, 2010, Goldberg joined Cyndi Lauper in the launch of her Give a Damn campaign to bring a wider awareness of discrimination of the LGBT community and to invite straight people to ally with the gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender community. Her high-profile support for LGBT rights and AIDS activism dates from the 1987 March on Washington, in which she participated. In May 2017, she spoke in support of transgender rights at the 28th GLAAD Media Awards.

Goldberg is on the Board of Selectors of Jefferson Awards for Public Service. She also serves on the National Council Advisory Board of the National Museum of American Illustration.

On January 24, 2021, Goldberg appeared with Tom Everett Scott as guests on the &quot;AmAIRican Grabbuddies&quot; marathon fundraising episode of &quot;The George Lucas Talk Show&quot;, where she spoke of her time working on &quot;Snow Buddies&quot; and raised money for the ASPCA.

===Entrepreneurship===
Goldberg co-founded Whoopi &amp; Maya, a company that made medical cannabis products for women seeking relief from menstrual cramps. Goldberg says she was inspired to go into business by &quot;a lifetime of difficult periods and the fact that cannabis was literally the only thing that gave me relief&quot;. The company was launched in April 2016 but announced in February 2020 that it was ceasing operations. In 2021, Goldberg announced the launch of a new line of cannabis products, &quot;Emma &amp; Clyde&quot;, named for her late mother and brother.

===Media appearances===

Goldberg performed the role of Califia, the Queen of the Island of California, for a theater presentation called &quot;Golden Dreams&quot; at Disney California Adventure Park, the second gate at the Disneyland Resort, in 2000. The show, which explains the history of the Golden State (California), opened on February 8, 2001, with the rest of the park. &quot;Golden Dreams&quot; closed in September 2008 to make way for the upcoming Little Mermaid ride planned for DCA. In 2001, Goldberg co-hosted the 50th Anniversary of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;.

In July 2006, Goldberg became the main host of the Universal Studios Hollywood Studio Tour, in which she appears multiple times in video clips shown to the guests on monitors placed on the trams.

She made a guest appearance on the situation comedy &quot;30 Rock&quot; during the series&#x27; fourth season, in which she played herself, counseling Tracy Jordan on winning the &quot;EGOT&quot;, the coveted combination of Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony Awards. On July 14, 2008, Goldberg announced on &quot;The View&quot; that from July 29 to September 7, she would perform in the Broadway musical &quot;Xanadu&quot;. On November 13, 2008, Goldberg&#x27;s birthday, she announced live on &quot;The View&quot; that she would be producing, along with Stage Entertainment, the premiere of &quot;Sister Act: The Musical&quot; at the London Palladium.

She gave a short message at the beginning of the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2008 wishing all the participants good luck, and stressing the importance of UNICEF, the official charity of the Junior Eurovision Song Contest. Since its launch in 2008, Goldberg has been a contributor for wowOwow.com, a new website for women to talk culture, politics, and gossip.

Goldberg has been a frequent guest narrator at Disney&#x27;s Candlelight Processional at Walt Disney World. She made a guest appearance in Michael Jackson&#x27;s short film for the song &quot;Liberian Girl&quot;. She also appeared on the seventh season of the cooking reality series &quot;Hell&#x27;s Kitchen&quot; as a special guest. On January 14, 2010, Goldberg made a one-night-only appearance at the Minskoff Theatre to perform in the mega-hit musical &quot;The Lion King&quot;. That same year, she attended the Life Ball in Austria.

Goldberg made her West End debut as the Mother Superior in a musical version of &quot;Sister Act&quot; for a limited engagement set for August 10–31, 2010, but prematurely left the cast on August 27 to be with her family; her mother had had a severe stroke. However, she later returned to the cast for five performances. The show closed on October 30, 2010.

===&quot;The View&quot;===

On September 4, 2007, Goldberg became the new moderator and co-host of &quot;The View&quot;, replacing Rosie O&#x27;Donnell. Goldberg&#x27;s debut as moderator drew 3.4 million viewers, 1 million fewer than O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s debut ratings. However, after 2 weeks, &quot;The View&quot; was averaging 3.5 million total viewers under Goldberg, a 7-percent increase from 3.3 million under O&#x27;Donnell the previous season.

Goldberg has made controversial comments on the program on several occasions. One of her first appearances involved defending Michael Vick&#x27;s participation in dogfighting as a result of &quot;cultural upbringing&quot;. In 2009, she opined that Roman Polanski&#x27;s rape conviction of a thirteen-year-old in 1977 was not &quot;rape-rape&quot;. She later clarified that she had intended to distinguish between statutory rape and forcible rape. The following year, in response to alleged comments by Mel Gibson considered racist, she said: &quot;I don&#x27;t like what he did here, but I know Mel and I know he&#x27;s not a racist&quot;.

In 2015, Goldberg was initially a defender of Bill Cosby from the rape allegations made against him, questioning why Cosby had never been arrested or tried for them. She later changed her stance, stating that &quot;all of the information that&#x27;s out there kinda points to &#x27;guilt&#x27;.&quot; After learning that the statute of limitations on these allegations had expired and thus Cosby could not be tried, she also stated her support for removing the statute of limitations for rape.

On January 31, 2022, Goldberg drew widespread criticism for stating on the show that the Holocaust was not based on race but &quot;about man&#x27;s inhumanity to man&quot;, telling her co-hosts: &quot;This is white people doing it to white people, so y&#x27;all going to fight amongst yourselves.&quot; She apologized on Twitter later that day. She maintained that the Nazis&#x27; issue was with ethnicity and not race on &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot; that same day, which drew further criticism. Goldberg issued another apology on air the following day. She was subsequently suspended from &quot;The View&quot; for two weeks over the comments.

== Artistry ==
Goldberg has stated that her influences are Richard Pryor, George Carlin, Moms Mabley, Lenny Bruce, Joan Rivers, Eddie Murphy, Bill Cosby, Sidney Poitier, and Harry Belafonte.

==Personal life==
Goldberg has been married three times. She was married to drug counselor Alvin Martin from 1973 to 1979; to cinematographer David Claessen from 1986 to 1988; and to union organizer Lyle Trachtenberg from 1994 to 1995. She has had live-in relationships with actor Frank Langella and playwright David Schein. Her other ex-boyfriends include businessman Michael Visbal, orthodontist Jeffrey Cohen, camera operator Edward Gold, and actors Timothy Dalton and Ted Danson. Danson controversially appeared in blackface during his 1993 Friars Club roast; Goldberg wrote some of his jokes for the event and defended Danson after a media furor.

She has stated that she has no plans to marry again: &quot;Some people are not meant to be married and I am not meant to. I&#x27;m sure it is wonderful for lots of people.&quot; In a 2011 interview with Piers Morgan, she explained that she was never in love with the men she married and commented: &quot;You have to really be committed to them...I don&#x27;t have that commitment. I&#x27;m committed to my family.&quot;

On May 9, 1973, Goldberg gave birth to a daughter, Alexandrea Martin, who also became an actress and producer. Through her daughter, Goldberg has three grandchildren and a great-granddaughter. On August 29, 2010, Goldberg&#x27;s mother, Emma Johnson, died after having a stroke. She left London at the time, where she had been performing in the musical &quot;Sister Act&quot;, but returned to perform on October 22, 2010. In 2015, Goldberg&#x27;s brother Clyde died of a brain aneurysm.

In 1991, Goldberg spoke out about her abortion in &quot;The Choices We Made: Twenty-Five Women and Men Speak Out About Abortion&quot;. In that book, she spoke about using a coat hanger to terminate a pregnancy at age 14. She said she had had six or seven abortions by the age of 25 and that birth control pills failed to stop several of her pregnancies. After the 2022 Kansas abortion referendum, Goldberg claimed that God would support abortion rights because he gave women freedom of choice.

Goldberg has stated that she was once a &quot;functioning&quot; drug addict. She has stated that she smoked marijuana before accepting the Best Supporting Actress award for &quot;Ghost&quot; in 1991.

Goldberg has dyslexia. She has lived in Llewellyn Park, a neighborhood in West Orange, New Jersey, saying she moved there to be able to be outside in private. She maintains an additional summer residence on the coast of Sardinia. She has expressed a preference for defining herself by the gender-neutral term &quot;actor&quot; rather than &quot;actress&quot;, saying: &quot;An actress can only play a woman. I&#x27;m an actor–I can play anything.&quot; In March 2019, Goldberg revealed that she had been battling pneumonia and sepsis, which caused her to take a leave of absence from &quot;The View&quot;.

On a season 9 episode of &quot;Finding Your Roots&quot;, featuring Pro Football Hall of Fame tight end Tony Gonzalez, it was revealed Goldberg and Gonzalez are distant cousins.

== Acting credits and awards ==

Having acted in over 150 films, Goldberg is one of the 19 people to achieve the EGOT, having won the four major American awards for professional entertainers: an Emmy (Television), a Grammy (Music), an Oscar (Film), and a Tony (Theater). She is the first black woman to have achieved all four awards.

Goldberg has received two Academy Award nominations, for &quot;The Color Purple&quot; and &quot;Ghost&quot;, winning for &quot;Ghost&quot;.

For &quot;Ghost&quot;, she also won a BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role in 1991.

She won a Grammy Award for Best Comedy Recording in 1985 for &quot;Whoopi Goldberg: Direct from Broadway&quot;, becoming only the second solo woman performer—not part of a duo or team—at the time to receive the award, and the first African-American woman. Goldberg is one of only three single women performers to receive that award. She won a Tony Award in 2002 as a producer of the Broadway musical &quot;Thoroughly Modern Millie&quot;. She has received eight Daytime Emmy nominations, winning two. She has received nine Primetime Emmy nominations. In 2009, Goldberg won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Talk Show Host for her work on &quot;The View&quot;. She shared the award with her then co-hosts Joy Behar, Sherri Shepherd, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, and Barbara Walters.

Goldberg is the recipient of the 1985 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding One-Person Show for her solo performance on Broadway. She has won three People&#x27;s Choice Awards.

She was the three-time (and inaugural) winner of the Kids&#x27; Choice Award for Favorite Movie Actress. In 2001, she became the first African-American female to receive the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor.

In 1990, Goldberg was officially named an honorary member of the Harlem Globetrotters exhibition basketball team by the members. In 1999, she received the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation Vanguard Award for her continued work in supporting the gay and lesbian community, as well as the Women in Film Crystal Award for outstanding women who, through their endurance and the excellence of their work, have helped to expand the role of women within the entertainment industry. In July 2010, the Ride of Fame honored Goldberg with a double-decker tour bus in New York City for her life&#x27;s achievements. In 2017, Goldberg was named a Disney Legend for her contributions to the Walt Disney Company.

<doc id="54989" wikidata="Q678410" url="?curid=54989" title="Marillion">
<text>Marillion are a British neo prog band, formed in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, in 1979. They emerged from the post-punk music scene in Britain and existed as a bridge between the styles of punk rock and classic progressive rock, becoming the most commercially successful neo-prog band of the 1980s.

Marillion released their debut single &quot;Market Square Heroes&quot; in 1982, followed by their first album &quot;Script for a Jester&#x27;s Tear&quot; in 1983. They have released 20 studio albums in total. The band achieved eight Top 10 UK albums between 1983 and 1994, including a No. 1 album in 1985 with &quot;Misplaced Childhood&quot;. The album also produced two UK Top 10 singles in &quot;Kayleigh&quot; (No. 2) and &quot;Lavender&quot; (No. 5), while the follow-up album, 1987&#x27;s &quot;Clutching at Straws&quot;, included another UK Top 10 single &quot;Incommunicado&quot; (No. 6). &quot;Clutching at Straws&quot; was the band&#x27;s last studio album with original lead singer Fish, who left for a solo career in late 1988. Altogether, during the Fish era, Marillion scored 11 Top 40 hits on the UK Singles Chart. &quot;Kayleigh&quot; also entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the United States.

In early 1989, Marillion announced Steve Hogarth as their new lead singer. The first album with him, &quot;Seasons End&quot;, was another Top 10 hit, and albums continued to chart well until their departure from EMI Records, following the release of their 1996 live album &quot;Made Again&quot;, and the dissipation of the band&#x27;s mainstream popularity in the late 1990s; save for a resurgence in the mid- to late-2000s, they have essentially been a cult act since then. Since the arrival of Hogarth, Marillion have achieved a further 12 Top 40 hit singles in the UK, including 2004&#x27;s &quot;You&#x27;re Gone&quot; from the album &quot;Marbles&quot;, which charted at No. 7 and is the biggest hit of the Hogarth era. In 2016, the album &quot;Fuck Everyone and Run (F E A R)&quot; returned them to the UK Albums Chart Top 10 for the first time since 1994&#x27;s &quot;Brave&quot;. Their most recent album, 2022&#x27;s &quot;An Hour Before It&#x27;s Dark&quot;, entered the UK Albums Chart at No. 2, their highest chart position since &quot;Clutching at Straws&quot; in 1987. Marillion continue to tour internationally, becoming ranked 38th in &quot;Classic Rock&quot;&#x27;s &quot;50 Best Live Acts of All Time&quot; in 2008. 

Despite unpopularity in the mainstream media and a consistently unfashionable status within the British music industry, Marillion have maintained a very loyal international fanbase, becoming widely acknowledged as playing a pioneering role in the development of crowdfunding and fan-funded music. They have sold over 15 million albums worldwide.

==History==
===The Fish era===
====Formation and early years (1978–1982)====

In 1977, drummer Mick Pointer joined Electric Gypsy, which also included Doug Irvine on bass, Alan King on vocals and Andy Glass (later of Solstice) on guitar. Pointer and Irvine left to form their own band, Silmarillion, named after J.R.R. Tolkien&#x27;s book &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, in late 1978. They played one London show as an instrumental band with Neil Cockle (keys) and Martin Jenner (guitar). 1979 saw a new line-up of Mick Pointer, Steve Rothery (guitar), Doug Irvine (bass/vocals) and Brian Jelliman (keys). They played their first concert at Berkhamsted Civic Centre, Hertfordshire, on 1 March 1980. According to Pointer, it was at this stage that the name was shortened to Marillion.

Other sources have that the band name was shortened to Marillion in 1981 to avoid potential copyright conflicts, at the same time as singer Fish and bassist William &#x27;Diz&#x27; Minnitt replaced original bassist/vocalist Doug Irvine following an audition at Leyland Farm Studios in Buckinghamshire on 2 January 1981. The line-up of Rothery, Pointer, Jelliman, Fish, and Minnitt performed their first gig at the Red Lion Pub at 35 Market Square in Bicester on 14 March 1981. Many years after his departure from Marillion, Irvine eventually joined the band Steam Shed.

By the end of 1981, Mark Kelly had replaced Jelliman on keyboards, with Pete Trewavas replacing Minnitt on bass in 1982. Minnitt later formed Pride of Passion and went on to perform with Zealey and Moore.

Marillion&#x27;s first recordings were two demos recorded in March and the summer of 1980, before Fish and Minnitt joined the band. Two versions of the Spring demo circulate amongst collectors; the first has four tracks; &quot;The Haunting of Gill House&quot;, &quot;Herne the Hunter&quot;, an untitled track known as &quot;Scott&#x27;s Porridge&quot;, and &quot;Alice&quot;. The second version has an instrumental version of &quot;Alice&quot; in place of &quot;Scott&#x27;s Porridge&quot;. All tracks are instrumental apart from &quot;Alice&quot;, with vocals by Doug Irvine. The summer demo has three tracks; &quot;Close&quot; (parts of which were later rewritten into &quot;The Web&quot;, &quot;He Knows You Know&quot; and &quot;Chelsea Monday&quot;), &quot;Lady Fantasy&quot; (an original based on an earlier Electric Gypsy song), and another version of &quot;Alice&quot;. Both were recorded at The Enid&#x27;s studio in Hertfordshire. Following Irvine&#x27;s departure and replacement by Fish and Minnitt, the band recorded another demo tape, produced by Les Payne, in July 1981 that included early versions of &quot;He Knows You Know&quot;, &quot;Garden Party&quot;, and &quot;Charting the Single&quot;.

The group attracted attention with a radio session for the &quot;Friday Rock Show&quot;. They were subsequently signed by EMI Records. They released their first single, &quot;Market Square Heroes&quot;, in 1982, with the 17-minute epic &quot;Grendel&quot; on the B-side of the 12&quot; version. Following the single, the band released their first full-length album in 1983.

====&quot;Script for a Jester&#x27;s Tear&quot; and &quot;Fugazi&quot; (1983–1984)====

The music on their debut album, &quot;Script for a Jester&#x27;s Tear&quot;, was born out of the intensive performances of the previous years. Featuring a dark progressive rock sound, the album was a commercial success, peaking at No. 7 on the UK album chart and producing the singles &quot;He Knows You Know&quot; (No. 35) and &quot;Garden Party&quot; (No. 16). Although they were accused of being Genesis soundalikes, the album reached the Platinum certification and has been credited with giving a second life to progressive rock bands from the previous era.

In April 1983, following the UK tour to promote &quot;Script for a Jester&#x27;s Tear&quot;, Mick Pointer was dismissed due to Fish&#x27;s dissatisfaction with what he later described as the drummer&#x27;s &quot;awful&quot; timing and failure to develop as a musician with the rest of the band. Over the next six months, three drummers passed through the band - original Camel drummer Andy Ward, followed by John &#x27;Martyr&#x27; Marter, followed by Jonathan Mover - before Ian Mosley, who had played for acts including Darryl Way&#x27;s Wolf, Trace, Gordon Giltrap, and Steve Hackett, was secured in October 1983. The second album &quot;Fugazi&quot;, released in early 1984, was written during this period of upheaval in the band&#x27;s lineup, with the recording beset by production problems. Despite this, the album built upon the success of &quot;Script for a Jester&#x27;s Tear&quot;, with a more streamlined hard rock sound. It improved on the chart placing of its predecessor by reaching the Top 5 and produced the singles &quot;Punch and Judy&quot; (No. 29) and &quot;Assassing&quot; (No. 22).

In November 1984, Marillion released their first live album, &quot;Real to Reel&quot;, featuring songs from &quot;Fugazi&quot; and &quot;Script for a Jester&#x27;s Tear&quot;, as well as &quot;Cinderella Search&quot; (B-side to &quot;Assassing&quot;) and the debut single &quot;Market Square Heroes&quot;, which had not been available on album until that point. &quot;Real to Reel&quot; entered the UK album charts at No. 8.

====&quot;Misplaced Childhood&quot; and international success (1985–1986)====

Their third and commercially most successful studio album was &quot;Misplaced Childhood&quot;, which had a more mainstream sound. The lead single from the album, &quot;Kayleigh&quot;, received major promotion by EMI and gained heavy rotation on BBC Radio 1 and Independent Local Radio stations as well as television appearances, bringing the band to the attention of a much wider audience. &quot;Kayleigh&quot; reached No. 2 in the UK and &quot;Lavender&quot; reached No. 5; these remain the only singles by the band to enter the Top 5.

Following the exposure given to &quot;Kayleigh&quot; and its subsequent chart success, the album became their only No. 1 in the UK, knocking Bryan Ferry&#x27;s &quot;Boys and Girls&quot; off the top spot and holding off a challenge from Sting, whose first solo album, &quot;The Dream of the Blue Turtles&quot;, entered the chart in the same week. The third single from the album, &quot;Heart of Lothian&quot;, became another Top 30 hit for the band, reaching No. 29. The album came sixth in &quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Albums of the Year&quot; in 1985. &quot;Kayleigh&quot; also gave Marillion its sole entry on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, reaching No. 74. In the summer of 1986, the band played to their biggest ever audience as special guests to Queen at a festival in Germany attended by a crowd of over 150,000 people. They were also offered the &quot;Highlander&quot; soundtrack but turned it down because of their world tour, a missed opportunity which Rothery later said he regretted.

====&quot;Clutching at Straws&quot; and the departure of Fish (1987–1988)====
The fourth studio album, &quot;Clutching at Straws&quot;, shed some of its predecessor&#x27;s pop stylings and retreated into a darker exploration of excess, alcoholism, and life on the road, representing the strains of constant touring that would result in the departure of Fish to pursue a solo career. It did continue the group&#x27;s commercial success, however; lead single &quot;Incommunicado&quot; charted at No. 6 in the UK, gaining the band an appearance on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, and the album entered the UK album chart at No. 2. &quot;Sugar Mice&quot; and &quot;Warm Wet Circles&quot; also became hit singles, both reaching No. 22. Fish has also stated in interviews since that he believes this was the best album he made with the band. The album came sixth in &quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Albums of the Year&quot; in 1987, equalling the ranking given to &quot;Misplaced Childhood&quot;. It was also included in &quot;Q&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;50 Best Recordings of the Year&quot;. Fish made the decision to leave the group after this tour, explaining his reasons for departing in a 2003 interview:

&quot;By 1987 we were over-playing live because the manager was on 20 per cent of the gross. He was making a fantastic amount of money while we were working our asses off. Then I found a bit of paper proposing an American tour. At the end of the day the band would have needed a £14,000 loan from EMI as tour support to do it. That was when I knew that, if I stayed with the band, I&#x27;d probably end up a raging alcoholic and be found overdosed and dying in a big house in Oxford with Irish wolfhounds at the bottom of my bed.&quot; 

Fish gave the band a choice to continue with either him or the manager, John Arnison. They sided with the manager and Fish left for a solo career. His last live performance with Marillion was at Craigtoun Country Park on 23 July 1988. The band&#x27;s second live album, &quot;The Thieving Magpie&quot;, was released in late 1988, marking the end of an era.

====Aftermath====
Owing to lengthy legal battles, informal contact between Fish and the other four band members apparently did not resume until 1999. Fish would disclose in the liner notes to the remastered edition of &quot;Clutching at Straws&quot; that he and his former bandmates had met up, discussed the demise of the band and renewed their friendship. They had come to the consensus that an excessive touring schedule and too much pressure from the band&#x27;s management led to the rift.

Although reportedly now on good personal terms, both camps had always made it very clear that the oft-speculated-upon reunion would never happen. When Fish headlined the &#x27;Hobble on the Cobbles&#x27; free concert in Aylesbury&#x27;s Market Square on 26 August 2007, the attraction of playing their debut single in its spiritual home proved strong enough to overcome any lingering bad feeling between the former bandmates, and Kelly, Mosley, Rothery, and Trewavas replaced Fish&#x27;s backing band for an emotional encore of &quot;Market Square Heroes&quot;.

In a press interview following the event, Fish denied this would lead to a full reunion, saying that: &quot;Hogarth does a great job with the band. We forged different paths over the 19 years.&quot;

===The Steve Hogarth era===
====&quot;Seasons End&quot; and &quot;Holidays in Eden&quot; (1989–1992)====
After the split, the band found Steve Hogarth, the former keyboardist and vocalist of the Europeans and the duo How We Live. Hogarth first sang with the band in Pete Trewavas&#x27; garage on 24 January 1989, and the first public pictures together were released in &quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine issue 230 on 18 March 1989. Hogarth was a significant contrast to Fish, coming from a new wave musical background instead of progressive rock, and possessing a very different vocal style, image and stage presence. He had also never owned a Marillion album before joining the band.

The group had already recorded some demos of the next studio album, which was eventually titled &quot;Seasons End&quot;, just prior to the split. With Fish taking his lyrics with him, Hogarth set to work crafting new words to existing songs, collaborating with lyricist and author John Helmer. The demo sessions of the songs from &quot;Seasons End&quot; with Fish vocals and lyrics can be found on the bonus disc of the remastered version of &quot;Clutching at Straws&quot;, while those lyrics found their way into various Fish solo albums, such as his first album &quot;Vigil in a Wilderness of Mirrors&quot;, some snippets on his second album &quot;Internal Exile&quot;, and even a line or two found its way to his third album &quot;Suits&quot;.

The first time Marillion would appear in public with Steve Hogarth as the new singer was under the banner of Low Fat Yoghurts, at the Crooked Billet pub in Stoke Row, on 8 June 1989. Only about 100 fans attended that Crooked Billet show, while considerably more attended Hogarth&#x27;s official introduction to fans at the recording of the promo video for &quot;Hooks in You&quot; at London&#x27;s Brixton Academy on 1 August that year. Hogarth&#x27;s first proper concert with Marillion was at the Palais des Sports in Besançon, France on 5 October following the release of &quot;Seasons End&quot;. The band ended 1989 with their traditional Christmas show at London&#x27;s Hammersmith Odeon, and kicked off 1990 with the beginning of the &quot;Seasons End&quot; world tour, in front of 180,000 people at Hollywood Rock Festival in Rio de Janeiro in January, then rolling through Canada and North America before returning to Europe. The tour would prove to be the longest that Hogarth has thus far undertaken with Marillion. The tour ended in the UK in July, with a sold out show at Wembley Arena, highlighting how successful the shift from Fish to the new frontman Hogarth had been.

Hogarth&#x27;s second album with the band, &quot;Holidays in Eden&quot;, was the first he wrote in partnership with the band from the beginning, and includes the song &quot;Dry Land&quot;, which Hogarth had written and recorded with his earlier duo, How We Live. As quoted from Steve Hogarth, &quot;&quot;Holidays in Eden&quot; was to become Marillion&#x27;s &quot;pop&quot;est album ever, and was greeted with delight by many, and dismay by some of the hardcore fans&quot;. EMI also wanted Marillon to deliver three hit singles from the album.

Marillion returned to their pseudonym Low Fat Yoghurts in December 1990 to preview their forthcoming album at the Moles club in Bath, Somerset. &quot;Holidays in Eden&quot; wouldn&#x27;t be released until June 1991, and was followed by a headlining appearance at the second and final Cumbria Rock Festival at Derwent Park in Workington 13 July 1991. The Cumbria appearance kick-started another lengthy world tour that would see the band course through the UK, before venturing through Europe and returning to the UK for some Christmas shows. At the beginning of 1992 the band built their own recording and rehearsal studio, The Racket Club, in Buckinghamshire. March and April 1992 saw Marillion back touring Canada and America, before returning to the UK for an exclusive and intimate 10th Anniversary show at London&#x27;s Borderline for members of their The Web fan club on 9 May 1992, followed by another European tour in August.

Marillion returned to the UK to headline Wembley Arena, for what would ultimately be the final time for the band, on 5 September 1992. The 1992 tour wound up in Baltimore, USA on 23 October. 1992 also saw the release of a 10th anniversary compilation album, &quot;A Singles Collection: Six of One, Half A Dozen of the Other&quot;, so-titled as it included six tracks from the Fish era and six from the two albums with Hogarth. It also included two new recordings, &quot;I Will Walk on Water&quot; and a cover of Rare Bird&#x27;s &quot;Sympathy&quot;. &quot;Sympathy&quot; was also released as a single and it reached No. 17 in the UK charts, the first time the band had been inside the singles Top 20 since &quot;Incommunicado&quot;. Marillion would play only one live show in 1993, a fan club gig at Tivoli Theatre in Utrecht on 19 June, as a duo with only Hogarth and Trewavas. The band spent most of 1993 recording what would become one of the most significant albums of their history.

====&quot;Brave&quot;, &quot;Afraid of Sunlight&quot; and split with EMI Records (1993–1995)====
&quot;Brave&quot; was released on 7 February 1994. A dark and richly complex concept album inspired by a true news story, it took the band 18 months to write and record and marked the start of their longtime relationship with producer Dave Meegan. 

Some of the material had been aired at that sole 1993 show in Utrecht, and was also previewed at low-key gigs in the Netherlands, Italy, and Germany before Marillion kicked off the &quot;Brave&quot; world tour at Liverpool&#x27;s Royal Court Theatre on 20 February 1994. The &quot;Brave&quot; tour was another lengthy one, and the band undertook the move to perform the whole of their new album in its entirety (as they had done with &quot;Misplaced Childhood&quot; just under a decade earlier). However, this meant the inevitable relegating of some Fish-era songs from the set. After a series of summer shows in Japan, the &quot;Brave&quot; tour wound its way down to Mexico in September. An independent film based on the album, which featured the band, was also released in February 1995. The film was directed by Richard Stanley.

The band&#x27;s next album, &quot;Afraid of Sunlight&quot;, was released June 1995. It would be Marillion&#x27;s last studio album with EMI Records. It received limited promotion, no mainstream radio airplay and the sales were disappointing for the band. Despite this, it was one of their most critically acclaimed albums and was included in &quot;Q&quot;&#x27;s 50 Best Albums of 1995. A particularly notable track on the album is &quot;Out of This World&quot;, a song about Donald Campbell, who died while trying to set a speed record on water. The song inspired an effort to recover both Campbell&#x27;s body and the &quot;Bluebird K7&quot;, the boat which Campbell crashed in, from the water. The recovery was finally undertaken in 2001, and both Steve Hogarth and Steve Rothery were invited. In 1998, Steve Hogarth said he considered &quot;Afraid of Sunlight&quot; the best album he made with the band.

On 2 August 1995, Marillion began their &quot;Afraid of Sunlight&quot; tour in USA at the Bayou in Washington DC. They returned to the UK and Europe before ending the tour in Krakow, Poland on 21 November 1995.

====&quot;This Strange Engine&quot;, &quot;Radiation&quot; and &quot;marillion.com&quot; (1996–1999)====
The band&#x27;s independent status was confirmed with signing a deal to the UK-based Castle. The first album to be released through Castle was the band&#x27;s third live album (the first with Hogarth) &quot;Made Again&quot;. Not only did it release Marillion from its obligations with EMI (as the fifth album in a five-album deal), as well as paying off the debts without creating new ones, it marked a certain symmetry with the first seven years of the band. Mark Kelly noted: &quot;Our first four studio albums were followed by a double live album that signalled the end of a chapter. Now, after another four studio albums, followed by a live album, we move from EMI.&quot; Featuring &quot;Brave&quot; in its entirety, &quot;Made Again&quot; was released 25 March 1996 as the final EMI-era Marillion release in the UK, with Castle handling the release in mainland Europe and the US. The release was followed by a brief tour with four dates in Europe at the end of April.

In the months prior, Rothery, Hogarth and Mosley used the break from Marillion to record separate solo projects. Mosley&#x27;s project, IRIS, with French guitarist Sylvian Gouvernaire and Trewavas, released &quot;Crossing the Desert,&quot; on 22 April 1996. Rothery&#x27;s project with the female singer Hannah Stobart, drummer Paul Craddick (from Enchant) and Trewavas, called The Wishing Tree, released their album &quot;Carnival of Souls&quot; in September 1996. Hogarth released his solo album &quot;Ice Cream Genius&quot; in February 1997.

&quot;This Strange Engine&quot; was the following Marillion album released in April 1997 in the UK, and in October in the US, with limited promotion from their new label Castle. Marillion could not afford to make tour stops in the United States. Their dedicated US fan base decided to solve the problem by raising some $60,000 themselves online to give to the band to come to the US. The band&#x27;s loyal fanbase (combined with the Internet) would eventually become vital to their existence. Following the completion of the extensive 1997 tour (including Marillion&#x27;s one-thousandth gig, on 27 October at the Amsterdam Paradiso), the band returned to their own studio, The Racket Club, in November. During 1997 to 1999, EMI issued 2-CD remastered editions of Marillion&#x27;s first eight studio albums (&quot;Script for a Jester&#x27;s Tear&quot; through &quot;Afraid of Sunlight&quot;), each with a second CD of non-album tracks and other archival recordings.

The band&#x27;s tenth album, &quot;Radiation,&quot; released on 21 September 1998, saw them taking a different approach and was received by fans with mixed reactions. The short &quot;Radiation&quot; tour, with only dates in the UK and mainland Europe, ended on 18 November 1998 at the Élysée Montmartre in Paris.

&quot;marillion.com&quot; was the follow-up, released on 18 October 1999, and showed progression in a new musical direction. However, the band were still unhappy with their record label situation. Under the terms of the deal, this was to be the third and final album distributed on the Castle label. The &quot;Dot Com&quot; tour, again with dates only in the UK and mainland Europe, started on 13 October at the MCM Cafe in Paris, and ended with a special Christmas show for the Web fanclubs worldwide in Aachen, Germany on 5 December 1999. For the whole of 2000, the band were writing the next album at the Racket Club and in November 2000 they played 2 Charity gigs at Bass Museum in Burton-on-Trent, before playing some more Christmas shows for their European fan clubs. Marillion needed a new strategy, and following the release of three albums via Castle, they came up with a novel approach for their next album.

====&quot;Anoraknophobia&quot; and &quot;Marbles&quot; (2000–2006)====
The band decided that they would try a radical experiment by asking their fans if they would help fund the recording of the next album by pre-ordering it before recording even started. The result was 12,674 pre-orders, which raised enough money to record and release &quot;Anoraknophobia&quot; in the beginning of May 2001. As a &#x27;thank-you&#x27; gesture to the fans who pre-ordered it, their names were credited in the sleeve notes and the pre-order &quot;Special Edition&quot; came in a deluxe 48-page hard-bound case with an extra enhanced CD. The band was able to strike a deal with EMI to also help distribute the album. This allowed Marillion to retain all the rights to their music while enjoying commercial distribution. The band went on tour which started in May 2001. A second leg of the tour (with a setlist largely decided by a poll of the fans) reached places that had never been played before, such as in the Azores at Ponta Delgada 22 September 2001. A US Tour was still not a possibility. A four-part BBC documentary &#x27;The Future Just Happened&#x27; aired in the UK on BBC2 in the Summer 2001. Featured in Episode 3 was Marillion&#x27;s revolutionary internet pre-order campaign for &quot;Anoraknophobia&quot;. The band released its fourth live album, entitled &quot;Anorak in the UK&quot;, in 2002.

April 2002 marked a new era of Marillion fandom. The band decided to book out a holiday camp and invite their fanbase to enjoy three entire days of Marillion with three concerts, signing sessions, and more. The hallmark of the weekend was the first night which hosts the entire rendition of an album of Marillion&#x27;s choice. The Marillion weekends began at Pontin&#x27;s Holiday Park, Brean Sands in the West Country, to which fans would fly in from all over the world. In March 2003 they continued and held the Marillion weekend at Butlin&#x27;s Minehead.

The success of &quot;Anoraknophobia&quot; allowed the band to start recording their next album, but they decided to leverage their fanbase once again to help raise money towards marketing and promotion of a new album. The band put up the album for pre-order in mid-production. This time fans responded by pre-ordering 18,000 copies.

&quot;Marbles&quot; was released at the end of April 2004 with a 2-CD version that was only available at Marillion&#x27;s website. The pre-order version (known as the Deluxe Campaign Edition) of &quot;Marbles&quot; was packaged as a 128-page hard-bound book, packed in a rigid slip case. Those who purchased the Deluxe Campaign Edition by the end of 31 December 2003 were directly helping the Campaign Fund, and as a &quot;Thank You&quot; their name was printed in the album credits (like with the previous album, &quot;Anoraknophobia&quot;).
 The band&#x27;s management organised the biggest promotional schedule since they had left EMI and Steve Hogarth secured interviews with prominent broadcasters on BBC Radio, including Matthew Wright, Bob Harris, Stuart Maconie, Simon Mayo and Mark Lawson. &quot;Marbles&quot; also became the band&#x27;s most critically acclaimed album since &quot;Afraid of Sunlight&quot;, prompting many positive reviews in the press. The band released &quot;You&#x27;re Gone&quot; as the lead single from the album. Aware that it was unlikely to gain much mainstream radio airplay, the band released the single in three separate formats and encouraged fans to buy a copy of each to get the single into the UK Top Ten. The single reached No. 7, making it the first Marillion song to reach the UK Top 10 since &quot;Incommunicado&quot; in 1987 and the band&#x27;s first Top 40 entry since &quot;Beautiful&quot; in 1995. The second single from the album, &quot;Don&#x27;t Hurt Yourself&quot;, reached No. 16. Following this, they released a download-only single, &quot;The Damage (live)&quot;, recorded at the band&#x27;s sell-out gig at the London Astoria. All of this succeeded in putting the band back in the public consciousness, making the campaign a success. In September 2004, Marillion returned for shows in Mexico, USA and ended in Canada Quebec City on 13 October 2004.

Marillion continued to tour throughout 2005, playing several summer festivals and embarking on acoustic tours of both Europe and the United States, followed up by the &quot;Not Quite Christmas Tour&quot; of Europe throughout the end of 2005.

A new DVD, &quot;Colours and Sound&quot;, was released in February 2006, documenting the creation, promotion, release, and subsequent European tour in support of the album &quot;Marbles&quot;.

====&quot;Somewhere Else&quot; and &quot;Happiness is the Road&quot; (2007–2008)====
In February 2007, the Marillion weekend was held abroad for the first time in the Netherlands at Center Parcs, Port Zélande.

April 2007 saw Marillion release their fourteenth studio album &quot;Somewhere Else&quot;, their first album in 10 years to make the UK Top 30. The success of the album was further underscored by that of the download-only single &quot;See it Like a Baby&quot;, making UK No. 45 (March 2007) and the traditional CD release of &quot;Thankyou Whoever You Are&quot; / &quot;Most Toys&quot;, which made UK No. 15 and No. 6 in the Netherlands during June 2007. The &quot;Somewhere Else&quot; tour started in Gibraltar 14 April 2007, and they also played in some places they had never been before like Bratislava.

In July 2008, the band posted a contest for fans to create a music video for the soon-to-be released single &quot;Whatever is Wrong with You&quot;, and post it on YouTube. The winner would win £5,000.

&quot;Happiness Is the Road&quot;, released in October 2008, again featured a pre-order Deluxe Edition with a list of the fans who bought in advance, and a more straightforward regular release. It is another double album, with one disc based on a concept and the second containing the other songs that are not a part of the theme. Before the album&#x27;s release, on 9 September 2008, Marillion pre-released their album via p2p networks themselves. Upon attempting to play the downloaded files, users were shown a video from the band explaining why they had taken this route. Downloaders were then able to opt to purchase the album at a user-defined price or select to receive DRM-free files for free, in exchange for an email address. The band explained that although they do not support piracy, they realised their music would inevitably be distributed online anyway, and wanted to attempt to engage with p2p users and make the best of the situation.

==== &quot;Less is More&quot; and &quot;Sounds That Can&#x27;t Be Made&quot; (2009–2014) ====
In April 2009, they took their Marillion weekend to Montreal for the first time.

The band&#x27;s sixteenth studio album (released 2 October 2009) was an acoustic album featuring new arrangements of previously released tracks (except one, the new track &quot;It&#x27;s Not Your Fault&quot;) entitled &quot;Less Is More&quot;. In October Marillion started an acoustic European tour which ended with a show in Istanbul 4 March 2010.

Their seventeenth studio album, titled &quot;Sounds That Can&#x27;t Be Made&quot;, was released in September 2012. Two versions of the album were released: A two-disc Deluxe Edition that included a DVD with &#x27;making-of&#x27; features and sound-check recordings and a single CD jewel case version. The Deluxe Edition also included a 128-page book that incorporated lyrics, artwork and, as was the case with &quot;Anoraknophobia&quot;, &quot;Marbles&quot; and &quot;Happiness is the Road&quot;, the names of people who pre-ordered the album. Parts of the album were recorded at Peter Gabriel&#x27;s Real World Studios in 2011.

Marillion were awarded &quot;Band of the Year&quot; at the annual Progressive Music Awards in 2013.

==== &quot;Fuck Everyone And Run (F E A R)&quot; and &quot;An Hour Before It&#x27;s Dark&quot; (2015–present) ====
In September 2015, Marillion announced that they were working on a new album, provisionally titled &quot;M18&quot; and later confirmed as &quot;Fuck Everyone And Run (F E A R)&quot;. As with several of their previous releases, the recording of the album was to be funded by fan pre-orders, this time through direct-to-fan website PledgeMusic. The album was released on 23 September 2016 debuting at No. 4 in the official UK charts of 30 September 2016, their highest placing since &quot;Clutching at Straws&quot; nearly three decades earlier. In November 2016, they announced their first ever show at the Royal Albert Hall in London, in October 2017. The gig sold out in just 4 minutes and was filmed for DVD release. They also won &quot;UK Band of the Year&quot; at the 2017 Progressive Music Awards.

In May 2017, Marillion took their Marillion Weekend to Santiago, Chile for the first time. In February 2018 Marillion returned to tour in the US and also played shows in Japan in September. In March 2018, the film of the Royal Albert Hall gig was premiered at cinemas around the UK, before the DVD launch, with the band attending the showing in London. On 6 April the concert was released as &quot;All One Tonight – Live at the Royal Albert Hall&quot;.

In March 2018, Hogarth was involved with fellow musician Howard Jones in helping to unveil a memorial to David Bowie, which is situated close to Aylesbury&#x27;s Market Square. The memorial was the inspiration of promoter David Stopps, who booked Bowie to appear at the Friars Aylesbury where he debuted his Ziggy Stardust persona. The bulk of the funds for the memorial were raised at a gig held at the Waterside Theatre in Aylesbury on the evening of the unveiling which Marillion headlined, alongside Jones, John Otway and the Dung Beatles, all of whom have close association to Aylesbury and in particular, the Friars.

In early 2019, Marillion entered the studio with the intention to record songs from their catalogue with friends from the orchestra who played with the band at the Royal Albert Hall shows in 2017. &quot;With Friends from the Orchestra&quot; was recorded at The Racket Club and Peter Gabriel&#x27;s Real World Studios and features reimagined versions of songs accompanied by the In Praise of Folly String Quartet with Sam Morris on French horn and Emma Halnan on flute. The album was released 29 November 2019. In November and December 2019, the orchestra followed Marillion on tour in the UK, returning for two nights at the Royal Albert Hall, and they also played shows in the Netherlands, France, Italy and Germany.

On 3 August 2021, Marillion announced their new pre-order campaign for a new studio album, entitled &quot;An Hour Before It&#x27;s Dark&quot;. The album was released on 4 March 2022.

In 2021, Marillion asked their fans to insure their 10-date Light at the End of the Tunnel Tour in November. Manager Lucy Jordache said: &quot;We&#x27;re asking our fans to pledge money that will be held in escrow and if it all goes Covid free, it will be returned to them at the end of the tour. But if we do have to cancel, then their money will be used to pay the band&#x27;s unavoidable expenses.&quot; The band had already invested more than £150,000 on preparations, but risked losing it all if just one member tested positive for COVID-19 and was forced to isolate. The tour was a success, and the donations were refunded to the fans who were named &quot;Lightsavers&quot;.

== Line-up, influences and sound changes ==

Marillion&#x27;s music has changed stylistically throughout their career. The band themselves stated that each new album tends to represent a reaction to the preceding one, and for this reason their output is difficult to &#x27;pigeonhole&#x27;. Although the band has featured two very distinct and different vocalists, the core instrumental line-up of Steve Rothery (lead guitar, and the sole &#x27;pre-Fish&#x27; original member), Pete Trewavas (bass), Mark Kelly (keyboards) and Ian Mosley (drums) has been unchanged since 1984.

Their 1980s sound (with Fish on vocals) was guitar and keyboard-led neo-prog. They have been described at their outset as &quot;a bridge between punk and classic progressive rock&quot;. Guitarist Steve Rothery wrote most of the music during the period Fish was in the band. Iron Maiden guitarist Janick Gers commented, &quot;What I love so much about Marillion is that they could be very strong and powerful and have very quiet passages, but the powerful stuff was really edgy and heavy... I just thought he (Fish) wrote good lyrics, and they wrote good music, and it fit together effortlessly.&quot;

They were often compared unfavourably by critics during the Fish era with the Peter Gabriel era of Genesis, although the band had many other influences. Fish was influenced by a wide range of artists and his favourite albums were by artists such as Van der Graaf Generator, Joni Mitchell, the Who, Pink Floyd, John Martyn, Yes, Lowell George, Led Zeppelin, Roy Harper, the Faces, the Beatles and Supertramp. Rothery&#x27;s main influences were Jimi Hendrix, Carlos Santana, David Gilmour, Andrew Latimer of Camel, Steve Hackett, Jeff Beck and Joni Mitchell, with Gordon Giltrap also an early influence on the development of his playing style. Kelly&#x27;s biggest inspiration was Yes keyboardist Rick Wakeman, and Trewavas&#x27; favourite bass player was Paul McCartney. Original drummer Mick Pointer was a huge fan of Neil Peart&#x27;s drumming in his favourite band, Rush.

During the Steve Hogarth era, their sound has been compared, on various albums, to more contemporary acts such as U2, Radiohead, Coldplay, Muse, Talk Talk, Elbow, and Massive Attack. In 2016, Hogarth himself was quoted as describing the band: &quot;If Pink Floyd and Radiohead had a love child that was in touch with their feminine side, they would be us.&quot; According to an interview with Rothery in 2016, many of their later albums with Hogarth had been written by jamming.

==In the media==

The chief music critic of &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Alexis Petridis, has described Marillion as &quot;perennially unfashionable prog-rockers&quot;. On the subject of joining the band in 1989, Steve Hogarth said in a 2001 interview: &quot;At about the same time, Matt Johnson of The The asked me to play piano on his tour. I always say I had to make a choice between the most hip band in the world, and the least.&quot; In the same conversation, he said: &quot;We&#x27;re just tired of the opinions of people who haven&#x27;t heard anything we&#x27;ve done in ten years. A lot of what&#x27;s spread about this band is laughable.&quot;

Much of the band&#x27;s enduring and unfashionable reputation stems from their emergence in the early 1980s as the most commercially successful band of the neo-prog movement, an unexpected revival of the progressive rock musical style that had fallen out of critical favour in the mid-1970s. Some early critics were quick to dismiss the band as clones of Peter Gabriel-era Genesis due to musical similarities, such as their extended songs, a prominent and Mellotron-influenced keyboard sound, vivid and fantastical lyrics and the equally vivid and fantastical artwork by Mark Wilkinson used for the sleeves of their albums and singles. Lead singer Fish was also often compared with Gabriel due to his early vocal style and theatrical stage performances, which in the early years included wearing face paint.

As Jon Wilde summarised in &quot;Melody Maker&quot; in 1989: At the end of a strange year for pop music, Marillion appeared in November 1982 with &quot;Market Square Heroes&quot;. There were many strange things about 1982, but Marillion were the strangest of them all. For six years, they stood out of time. Marillion were the unhippest group going. As punk was becoming a distant echo, they appeared with a sound and an attitude that gazed back longingly to the age of Seventies pomp. When compared to Yes, Genesis and ELP, they would take it as a compliment. The Eighties have seen some odd phenomena. But none quite as odd as Marillion. Along the way, as if by glorious fluke, they turned out some singles that everybody quietly liked – &quot;Garden Party&quot;, &quot;Punch and Judy&quot; and &quot;Incommunicado&quot;. By this time, Marillion did not need the support of the hip-conscious. They were massive. Perhaps the oddest thing about Marillion was that they became one of the biggest groups of the decade. They might have been an anomaly but they were monstrously effective.

The band&#x27;s unfashionable reputation and image has often been mentioned in the media, even in otherwise positive reviews. In &quot;Q&quot; in 1987, David Hepworth wrote: &quot;Marillion may represent the inelegant, unglamorous, public bar end of the current Rock Renaissance but they are no less part of it for that. &quot;Clutching at Straws&quot; suggests that they may be finally coming in from the cold.&quot; In the same magazine in 1995, Dave Henderson wrote: &quot;It&#x27;s not yet possible to be sacked for showing an affinity for Marillion, but has there ever been a band with a larger stigma attached?&quot; He also argued that if the album &quot;Afraid of Sunlight&quot; &quot;had been made by a new, no baggage-of-the-past combo, it would be greeted with open arms, hailed as virtual genius.&quot; In &quot;Record Collector&quot; in 2002, Tim Jones argued they were &quot;one of the most unfairly berated bands in Britain&quot; and &quot;one of its best live rock acts.&quot; In 2004, &quot;Classic Rock&quot;&#x27;s Jon Hotten wrote: &quot;That genre thing has been a bugbear of Marillion&#x27;s, but it no longer seems relevant. What are Radiohead if not a progressive band?&quot; and said Marillion were &quot;making strong, singular music with the courage of their convictions, and we should treasure them more than we do.&quot; In the &quot;Q&quot; &amp; &quot;Mojo&quot; Classic Special Edition &quot;Pink Floyd &amp; The Story of Prog Rock&quot;, an article on Marillion written by Mick Wall described them as &quot;probably the most misunderstood band in the world&quot;.

In 2007, Stephen Dalton of &quot;The Times&quot; stated: The band have just released their 14th album, &quot;Somewhere Else&quot;, which is really rather good. Containing tracks that shimmer like Coldplay, ache like Radiohead and thunder like Muse, it is better than 80 per cent of this month&#x27;s releases. But you are unlikely to hear Marillion on British radio, read about them in the music press or see them play a major festival. This is largely because Marillion have – how can we put this kindly? – an image problem. Their music is still perceived as bloated, bombastic mullet-haired prog-rock, even by people who have never heard it. In fairness, they did once release an album called &quot;Script for a Jester&#x27;s Tear&quot;. But, come on, we all had bad hair days in the 1980s.

Despite publishing a very good review for their 1995 album &quot;Afraid of Sunlight&quot; and including it in their 50 Best Albums of 1995, &quot;Q&quot; refused to interview the band or write a feature on them. Steve Hogarth later said: &quot;How can they say, this is an amazing record... no, we don&#x27;t want to talk to you? It&#x27;s hard to take when they say, here&#x27;s a very average record... we&#x27;ll put you on the front cover.&quot;

In 2001, the television critic of &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Gareth McLean, used his review of the Michael Lewis BBC Two documentary, &quot;&quot;, to concentrate on launching a scathing attack on the band, whose appearance only constituted one segment of the programme. He described them as &quot;once dodgy and now completely rubbish&quot; and he characterised their fans as &quot;slightly simple folks&quot;. He also dismissed the band&#x27;s efforts to continue their career without a label by dealing directly with their fans on the Internet, writing: &quot;One suspects that their decision occurred round about the time that the record industry decided to shun Marillion.&quot;

Rachel Cooke, a writer for &quot;The Observer&quot; and &quot;New Statesman&quot;, has repeatedly referred negatively to the band and insulted their fans in her articles.

In an interview in 2000, Hogarth expressed regret about the band retaining their name after he joined: If we had known when I joined Marillion what we know now, we&#x27;d have changed the name and been a new band. It was a mistake to keep the name, because what it represented in the mid-Eighties is a millstone we now carry. If we&#x27;d changed it, I think we would have been better off. We would have been judged for our music. It&#x27;s such a grave injustice that the media constantly calls us a &#x27;dinosaur prog band&#x27;. They only say that out of ignorance because they haven&#x27;t listened to anything we&#x27;ve done for the last 15 bloody years. If you hear anything we&#x27;ve done in the last five or six years, that description is totally irrelevant... It&#x27;s a massive frustration that no-one will play our stuff. If we send our single to Radio 1 they say: &#x27;Sorry, we don&#x27;t play music by bands who are over so-many years old... and here&#x27;s the new U2 single.&#x27; I suppose it&#x27;s something everyone has to cope with – every band are remembered for their big hit single, irrespective of how much they change over the years. But you can only transcend that by continuing to have hits. It&#x27;s Catch 22. You know, at some stage, someone has to notice that we&#x27;re doing interesting things. Someday someone will take a retrospective look at us and be surprised.

The 2013 film &quot;Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa&quot; includes a joke reference to a former drummer of the band. The band were quoted: &quot;We know Marillion are seen as &#x27;uncool&#x27; but we were delighted to be a part of it.&quot;

==Crowdfunding pioneers==
Marillion are widely considered to have been one of the first mainstream acts to have fully recognised and tapped the potential for commercial musicians to interact with their fans via the internet, starting in around 1996, and are nowadays often characterised as a rock &amp; roll &#x27;Web Cottage Industry&#x27;. The history of the band&#x27;s use of the Internet is described by Michael Lewis in the book &quot;&quot; as an example of how the Internet is shifting power away from established elites, such as multinational record labels and record producers.

The band are renowned for having an extremely dedicated following (often self-termed &#x27;Freaks&#x27;), with some fans regularly travelling significant distances to attend single gigs, driven in large part by the close fan base involvement which the band cultivate via their website, podcasts, biennial conventions and regular fanclub publications. The release of their 2001 album &quot;Anoraknophobia&quot;, which was funded by their fans through advance orders instead of by the band signing to a record company, gained significant attention and was called &quot;a unique funding campaign&quot; by the BBC. Writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Alexis Petridis described Marillion as &quot;the undisputed pioneers&quot; of fan-funded music.

<text>The Mantoux test or Mendel–Mantoux test (also known as the Mantoux screening test, tuberculin sensitivity test, Pirquet test, or PPD test for purified protein derivative) is a tool for screening for tuberculosis (TB) and for tuberculosis diagnosis. It is one of the major tuberculin skin tests used around the world, largely replacing multiple-puncture tests such as the tine test. The Heaf test, a form of tine test, was used until 2005 in the UK, when it was replaced by the Mantoux test. The Mantoux test is endorsed by the American Thoracic Society and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It was also used in the USSR and is now prevalent in most of the post-Soviet states, although Soviet mantoux produced many false positives due to children&#x27;s allergic reaction.

==History==


Tuberculin is a glycerol extract of the tubercle bacillus. Purified protein derivative (PPD) tuberculin is a precipitate of species-nonspecific molecules obtained from filtrates of sterilized, concentrated cultures. The tuberculin reaction was first described by Robert Koch in 1890. The test was first developed and described by the German physician Felix Mendel in 1908. It is named after Charles Mantoux, a French physician who built on the work of Koch and Clemens von Pirquet to create his test in 1907. However, the test was unreliable due to impurities in tuberculin which tended to cause false results.

Esmond R. Long and Florence B. Seibert identified the active agent in tuberculin as a protein. Seibert then spent a number of years developing methods for separating and purifying the protein from &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot;, obtaining purified protein derivative (PPD) and enabling the creation of a reliable test for tuberculosis. Her first publication on the purification of tuberculin appeared in 1934. By the 1940s, Seibert&#x27;s PPD was the international standard for tuberculin tests. In 1939, Russian M.A. Linnikova created a modified version of PPD. In 1954, the Soviet Union started mass production of PPD-L, named after Linnikova.

==Procedure==
In the Mantoux test, a standard dose of 5 tuberculin units (TU – 0.1 ml), according to the CDC, or 2 TU of Statens Serum Institute (SSI) tuberculin RT23 in 0.1 ml solution, according to the National Health Service, is injected intradermally (between the layers of dermis) on the flexor surface of the left forearm, mid-way between elbow and wrist. The injection should be made with a tuberculin syringe, with the needle bevel facing upward. When placed correctly, injection should produce a pale wheal of the skin, 6 to 10 mm in diameter. The result of the test is read after 48–96 hours, ideally after 72 hours/3rd day. This procedure is termed the &#x27;Mantoux technique&#x27;. A person who has been exposed to the bacteria would be expected to mount an immune response in the area of skin containing the bacterial proteins. This response is a classic example of &#x27;delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction&#x27; (DTH), a type IV of hypersensitivities. T cells and myeloid cells are attracted to the site of reaction in 1–3 days and generate local inflammation. The reaction is read by measuring the diameter of induration (palpable raised, hardened area) across the forearm (perpendicular to the long axis) in millimeters. If there is no induration, the result should be recorded as &quot;0 mm&quot;. Erythema (redness) should not be measured. In the Pirquet version of the test tuberculin is applied to the skin via scarification.

==Classification of tuberculin reaction==
The results of this test must be interpreted carefully. The person&#x27;s medical risk factors determine at which increment (5 mm, 10 mm, or 15 mm) of induration the result is considered positive. A positive result indicates TB exposure.
* 5 mm or more is positive in
** An HIV-positive person
** Persons with recent contacts with a TB patient
** Persons with nodular or fibrotic changes on chest X-ray consistent with old healed TB
** Patients with organ transplants, and other immunosuppressed patients
* 10 mm or more is positive in
** Recent arrivals (less than five years) from high-prevalence countries
** Injection drug users
** Residents and employees of high-risk congregate settings (e.g., prisons, nursing homes, hospitals, homeless shelters, etc.)
** Mycobacteriology lab personnel
** Persons with clinical conditions that place them at high risk (e.g., diabetes, prolonged corticosteroid therapy, leukemia, end-stage renal disease, chronic malabsorption syndromes, low body weight, etc.)
** Children less than four years of age, or children and adolescents exposed to adults in high-risk categories
* 15 mm or more is positive in
** Persons with no known risk factors for TB

A tuberculin test conversion is defined as an increase of 10 mm or more within a two-year period, regardless of age. Alternative criteria include increases of 6, 12, 15 or 18 mm.

==False positive result==
TST (tuberculin skin test) positive is measured by size of induration. The size of the induration considered to be a positive result depends on risk factors. For example, a low-risk patient must have a larger induration for a positive result than a high-risk patient. High-risk groups include recent contacts, those with HIV, those with chest radiograph with fibrotic changes, organ transplant recipients, and those with immunosuppression.

A meta-analysis in 2014 found that the Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccine reduced infections by 19–27% and reduced progression to active tuberculosis by 71%. The Ohio Department of Health states that it give 80% of children protection against tuberculous meningitis and miliary tuberculosis. Therefore, a positive TST/PPD in a person who has received BCG vaccine is interpreted as latent TB infection (LTBI).
Due to the test&#x27;s low specificity, most positive reactions in low-risk individuals are false positives. A false positive result may be caused by nontuberculous mycobacteria or previous administration of BCG vaccine. Vaccination with BCG may result in a false-positive result for many years after vaccination.

False positives can also occur when the injected area is touched, causing swelling and itching. If the swelling is less than 5 mm, it is possibly due to error by the healthcare personnel causing inflammation to the area.

Another source of false positive results can be allergic reaction or hypersensitivity. Although rare (about 0.08 reported reactions per million doses of tuberculin), these reactions can be dangerous and precautions should be taken by having epinephrin available.

==False negative result==
Reaction to the PPD or tuberculin test is suppressed by the following conditions:
* Recent TB infection (less than 8–10 weeks)
* Infectious mononucleosis
* Live virus vaccine – The test should not be carried out within 3 weeks of live virus vaccination (e. g. MMR vaccine or Sabin vaccine).
* Sarcoidosis
* Hodgkin&#x27;s disease
* Corticosteroid therapy/steroid use
* Malnutrition
* Immunological compromise – Those on immuno-suppressive treatment or those with HIV and low CD4 T cell counts, frequently show negative results from the PPD test.
This is because the immune system needs to be functional to mount a response to the protein derivative injected under the skin. A false negative result may occur in a person who has been recently infected with TB, but whose immune system hasn&#x27;t yet reacted to the bacteria.
* Upper respiratory virus infection
In case a second tuberculin test is necessary it should be carried out in the other arm to avoid hypersensitising the skin.

==BCG vaccine and the Mantoux test==
The role of Mantoux testing in people who have been vaccinated is disputed. The US recommends that tuberculin skin testing is not contraindicated for BCG-vaccinated persons, and prior BCG vaccination should not influence the interpretation of the test. The UK recommends that interferon-γ testing should be used to help interpret positive Mantoux tests of over 5 mm, and repeated tuberculin skin testing must not be done in people who have had BCG vaccinations. In general, the US recommendation may result in a larger number of people being falsely diagnosed with latent tuberculosis, while the UK approach has an increased chance of missing patients with latent tuberculosis who should be treated.

According to the US guidelines, latent tuberculosis infection diagnosis and treatment is considered for any BCG-vaccinated person whose skin test is 10 mm or greater, if any of these circumstances are present:
* Was in contact with another person with infectious TB
* Was born or has lived in a high TB prevalence country
* Is continually exposed to populations where TB prevalence is high

==Anergy testing==
In cases of anergy, a lack of reaction by the body&#x27;s defence mechanisms when it comes into contact with foreign substances, the tuberculin reaction will occur weakly, thus compromising the value of Mantoux testing. For example, anergy is present in AIDS, a disease which strongly depresses the immune system. Therefore, anergy testing is advised in cases where there is suspicion that anergy is present. However, routine anergy skin testing is not recommended.

==Two-step testing==
Some people who have been infected with TB may have a negative reaction when tested years after infection, as the immune system response may gradually wane. This initial skin test, though negative, may stimulate (boost) the body&#x27;s ability to react to tuberculin in future tests. Thus, a positive reaction to a subsequent test may be misinterpreted as a new infection, when in fact it is the result of the boosted reaction to an old infection.

Use of two-step testing is recommended for initial skin testing of adults who will be retested periodically (e.g., health care workers). This ensures any future positive tests can be interpreted as being caused by a new infection, rather than simply a reaction to an old infection.
* The first test is read 48–72 hours after injection.
** If the first test is positive, consider the person infected.
** If the first test is negative, give a second test one to three weeks after the first injection.
* The second test is read 48–72 hours after injection.
** If the second test is positive, consider the person infected in the distant past.
** If the second test is negative, consider the person uninfected.

A person who is diagnosed as &quot;infected in the distant past&quot; on two-step testing is called a &quot;tuberculin reactor&quot;.

The US recommendation that prior BCG vaccination be ignored results in almost universal false diagnosis of tuberculosis infection in people who have had BCG (mostly foreign nationals).

==The latest interpretation for Mantoux test results==
According to the guidelines published by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2005, the results are re-categorized into 3 parts based on their previous or baseline outcomes:
* Baseline test: ≥10 mm is positive (either first or second step); 0 to 9 mm is negative
* Serial testing without known exposure: Increase of ≥10 mm is positive
* Known exposure:
** ≥5 mm is positive in patients with baseline of 0 mm
** ≥10 mm is positive in patients with negative baseline or previous screening result of &gt;0 mm

==Recent developments==
In addition to tuberculin skin tests such as (principally) the Mantoux test, interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs) have become common in clinical use in the 2010s. In some contexts they are used instead of TSTs, whereas in other contexts TSTs and IGRAs both continue to be useful.

The QuantiFERON-TB Gold blood test measures the patient&#x27;s immune reactivity to the TB bacterium, and is useful for initial and serial testing of persons with an increased risk of latent or active tuberculosis infection. Guidelines for its use were released by the CDC in December 2005. QuantiFERON-TB Gold is FDA-approved in the United States, has CE Mark approval in Europe and has been approved by the MHLW in Japan. The interferon gamma release assay is the preferred method for patients who have had immunosuppression and are about to start biological therapies.

T-SPOT.TB is another IGRA; it uses the ELISPOT method.

==Heaf test==
The Heaf tuberculin skin test was used in the United Kingdom, but discontinued in 2005. The equivalent Mantoux test positive levels done with 10 TU (0.1 ml at 100 TU/ml, 1:1000) are
* &lt;5 mm induration (Heaf 0–1)
* 5–15 mm induration (Heaf 2)
* &gt;15 mm induration (Heaf 3–4)

<doc id="54996" wikidata="Q594013" url="?curid=54996" title="Prader–Willi syndrome">
<text>Prader–Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic disorder caused by a loss of function of specific genes on chromosome 15. In newborns, symptoms include weak muscles, poor feeding, and slow development. Beginning in childhood, those affected become constantly hungry, which often leads to obesity and type 2 diabetes. Mild to moderate intellectual impairment and behavioral problems are also typical of the disorder. Often, affected individuals have a narrow forehead, small hands and feet, short height, and light skin and hair. Most are unable to have children.
About 74% of cases occur when part of the father&#x27;s chromosome 15 is deleted. In another 25% of cases, the affected person has two copies of the maternal chromosome 15 from the mother and lacks the paternal copy. As parts of the chromosome from the mother are turned off through imprinting, they end up with no working copies of certain genes. PWS is not generally inherited, but rather the genetic changes happen during the formation of the egg, sperm, or in early development. No risk factors are known for the disorder. Those who have one child with PWS have less than a 1% chance of the next child being affected. A similar mechanism occurs in Angelman syndrome, except the defective chromosome 15 is from the mother, or two copies are from the father.
Prader–Willi syndrome has no cure. Treatment may improve outcomes, especially if carried out early. In newborns, feeding difficulties may be supported with feeding tubes. Strict food supervision is typically required, starting around the age of three, in combination with an exercise program. Growth hormone therapy also improves outcomes. Counseling and medications may help with some behavioral problems. Group homes are often necessary in adulthood.
PWS affects between 1 in 10,000 to 30,000 people worldwide. The condition is named after Swiss physicians Andrea Prader and Heinrich Willi who, together with Alexis Labhart, described it in detail in 1956. An earlier description was made in 1887 by British physician John Langdon Down.

== Signs and symptoms ==
PWS symptoms can range from poor muscle tone during infancy to behavioral problems in early childhood. Some symptoms often found in infants, besides poor muscle tone, are a lack of eye coordination; almond-shaped eyes; thin upper lip; and, due to poor muscle tone, lack of a strong sucking reflex. Their cries are weak, and they have difficulty waking up.

More aspects seen in a clinical overview include hypotonia and abnormal neurologic function, hypogonadism, developmental and cognitive delays, hyperphagia and obesity, short stature, and behavioral and psychiatric disturbances.

The following features and signs are indicators of PWS, although not all will be present:

=== In-utero and birth ===
=== Childhood ===
=== Adulthood ===
=== Physical appearance ===
=== Neurocognitive ===
Individuals with PWS are at risk of learning and attention difficulties. Curfs and Fryns (1992) conducted research into the varying degrees of learning disability found in PWS.

Cassidy found that 40% of individuals with PWS have borderline/low average intelligence, a figure higher than the 32% found in Curfs and Fryns&#x27; study. However, both studies suggest that most individuals (50–65%) fall within the mild/borderline/low average intelligence range.

Children with PWS show an unusual cognitive profile. They are often strong in visual organization and perception, including reading and vocabulary, but their spoken language (sometimes affected by hypernasality) is generally poorer than their comprehension. A marked skill in completing jigsaw puzzles has been noted, but this may be an artifact of increased practice.

Auditory information processing and sequential processing are relatively poor, as are arithmetic and writing skills, visual and auditory short-term memory, and auditory attention span. These sometimes improve with age, but deficits in these areas remain throughout adulthood.

PWS may be associated with psychosis.

=== Behavioral ===
PWS is frequently associated with a constant insatiable appetite, which persists no matter how much the patient eats, often resulting in morbid obesity. Caregivers need to strictly limit the patients&#x27; access to food, usually by installing locks on refrigerators and on all closets and cabinets where food is stored. It is the most common genetic cause of morbid obesity in children. Currently, no consensus exists as to the cause for this symptom, although genetic abnormalities in chromosome 15 disrupt the normal functioning of the hypothalamus. Given that the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus regulates many basic processes, including appetite, a link may well exist. In the hypothalamus, nerve cells that produce oxytocin, a hormone thought to contribute to satiety, are believed to be abnormal in people with PWS.

People with PWS have high ghrelin levels, which are thought to contribute directly to the increased appetite, hyperphagia and obesity seen in this syndrome. Cassidy states the need for a clear delineation of behavioral expectations, the reinforcement of behavioural limits, and the establishment of regular routines.

The main mental-health difficulties experienced by people with PWS include compulsive behaviour (usually manifested in skin picking) and anxiety. Psychiatric symptoms, for example, hallucinations, paranoia and depression, have been described in some cases and affect about 5–10% of young adults. Patients are also often extremely stubborn and prone to anger. Psychiatric and behavioural problems are the most common cause of hospitalization.

Typically 70–90% of affected individuals develop behavioral patterns in early childhood. Aspects of these patterns can include stubbornness, temper tantrums, controlling and manipulative behavior, difficulty with change in routine and compulsive-like behaviors.

=== Endocrine ===
Several aspects of PWS support the concept of a growth hormone deficiency. Specifically, individuals with PWS are obese with short stature, abnormal body composition, reduced fat-free mass, reduced lean body mass and total energy expenditure, and decreased bone density. PWS is characterized by hypogonadism. This is manifested as undescended testes in males and benign premature adrenarche in females. Testes may descend with time or can be managed with surgery or testosterone replacement. Adrenarche may be treated with hormone replacement therapy.

=== Ophthalmologic ===
PWS is commonly associated with development of strabismus. In one study, over 50% of patients had strabismus, mainly esotropia.

Some individuals (often those with deletions) may have hypopigmented fundi due to OCA2 haploinsufficiency.

== Genetics ==

PWS is related to an epigenetic phenomenon known as imprinting. Normally, a fetus inherits an imprinted maternal copy of PW genes and a functional paternal copy of PW genes. Due to imprinting, the maternally inherited copies of these genes are virtually silent, and the fetus therefore relies on the expression of the paternal copies of the genes. In PWS, however, there is mutation/deletion of the paternal copies of PW genes, leaving the fetus with no functioning PW genes. The PW genes are the &quot;SNRPN&quot; and &quot;NDN&quot; genes, along with clusters of snoRNAs: SNORD64, SNORD107, SNORD108 and two copies of SNORD109, 29 copies of SNORD116 (HBII-85) and 48 copies of SNORD115 (HBII-52). These genes are located on chromosome 15 located in the region 15q11-13. This so-called PWS/AS region in the paternal chromosome 15 may be lost by one of several genetic mechanisms, which in the majority of instances occurs through chance mutation. Other, less common mechanisms include uniparental disomy, sporadic mutations, chromosome translocations, and gene deletions.

Region 15q11-13 is implicated in both PWS and Angelman syndrome (AS). While PWS results from the loss of PW genes within this region on the paternal chromosome, loss of a different gene (&quot;UBE3A&quot;) within the same region on the maternal chromosome causes AS. PWS and AS represent the first reported instances of disorders related to imprinting in humans.

The risk to the sibling of an affected child of having PWS depends upon the genetic mechanism which caused the disorder. The risk to siblings is &lt;1% if the affected child has a gene deletion or uniparental disomy, up to 50% if the affected child has a mutation of the imprinting control region, and up to 25% if a parental chromosomal translocation is present. Prenatal testing is possible for any of the known genetic mechanisms.

A microdeletion in one family of the snoRNA HBII-52 has excluded it from playing a major role in the disease.

Studies of human and mouse model systems have shown deletion of the 29 copies of the C/D box snoRNA SNORD116 (HBII-85) to be the primary cause of PWS.

== Diagnosis ==
It is traditionally characterized by hypotonia, short stature, hyperphagia, obesity, behavioral issues (specifically obsessive–compulsive disorder-like behaviors), small hands and feet, hypogonadism, and mild intellectual disability. However, with early diagnosis and early treatment (such as with growth hormone therapy), the prognosis for persons with PWS is beginning to change. Like autism, PWS is a spectrum disorder and symptoms can range from mild to severe and may change throughout the person&#x27;s lifetime. Various organ systems are affected.

Traditionally, PWS was diagnosed by clinical presentation. Currently, the syndrome is diagnosed through genetic testing; testing is recommended for newborns with pronounced hypotonia. Early diagnosis of PWS allows for early intervention and the early prescription of growth hormone. Daily recombinant growth hormone (GH) injections are indicated for children with PWS. GH supports linear growth and increased muscle mass, and may lessen food preoccupation and weight gain.

The mainstay of diagnosis is genetic testing, specifically DNA-based methylation testing to detect the absence of the paternally contributed PWS/AS region on chromosome 15q11-q13. Such testing detects over 97% of cases. Methylation-specific testing is important to confirm the diagnosis of PWS in all individuals, but especially those who are too young to manifest sufficient features to make the diagnosis on clinical grounds or in those individuals who have atypical findings.

PWS is often misdiagnosed due to its unfamiliarity in the medical community. Sometimes it is misdiagnosed as Down syndrome, simply because of the relative frequency of Down syndrome compared to PWS.

== Treatment ==
While PWS has no cure, several treatments are available to lessen the condition&#x27;s symptoms. During infancy, subjects should undergo therapies to improve muscle strength. Speech and occupational therapy are also indicated. During the school years, children benefit from a highly structured learning environment and extra help. The largest problem associated with the syndrome is severe obesity. Access to food must be strictly supervised and limited, usually by installing locks on all food-storage places including refrigerators. Physical activity in individuals with PWS for all ages is needed to optimize strength and promote a healthy lifestyle.

An intranasal formulation of betahistine dihydrochloride received orphan drug designation from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of obesity associated with Prader–Willi syndrome.

Prescription of daily recombinant GH injections are indicated for children with PWS. GH supports linear growth and increased muscle mass, and may lessen food preoccupation and weight gain.

Because of severe obesity, obstructive sleep apnea is a common sequela, and a positive airway pressure machine is often needed. A person who has been diagnosed with PWS may have to undergo surgical procedures. One surgery that has proven to be unsuccessful for treating the obesity is gastric bypass.

Behavior and psychiatric problems should be detected early for the best results. These issues are best when treated with parental education and training. Sometimes medication is introduced as well. Serotonin agonists have been most effective in lessening temper tantrums and improving compulsivity.

==Epidemiology==
PWS affects one in 10,000 to one in 25,000 newborns. More than 400,000 people live with PWS.

== Society and culture ==
Despite its rarity, PWS has been often referenced in popular culture, partly due to curiosity surrounding the insatiable appetite and the obesity symptomatic of the syndrome.

Katie Price&#x27;s son Harvey is one well-known person with PWS.

The syndrome has been depicted and documented several times in television. A fictional individual with PWS featured in the episode &quot;Dog Eat Dog&quot; of the television series &quot;&quot;, which aired in the US on 24 November 2005. In July 2007, Channel 4 aired a 2006 documentary called &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop Eating&quot;, surrounding the everyday lives of two people with PWS, Joe and Tamara. In a 2010 episode of &quot;Extreme Makeover: Home Edition,&quot; Sheryl Crow helped Ty Pennington rebuild a home for a family whose youngest son, Ethan Starkweather, was living with the syndrome. In a 2012 episode of &quot;Mystery Diagnosis&quot; on the Discovery Health channel, Conor Heybach, who has Prader–Willi syndrome, shared how he was diagnosed with it.

<doc id="54997" wikidata="Q10949994" url="?curid=54997" title="Scotia">
<text>Scotia is a Latin placename derived from &quot;Scoti&quot;, a Latin name for the Gaels, first attested in the late 3rd century. The Romans referred to Ireland as &quot;Scotia&quot; around 500 A.D. From the 9th century on, its meaning gradually shifted, so that it came to mean only the part of Britain lying north of the Firth of Forth: the Kingdom of Scotland. By the later Middle Ages it had become the fixed Latin term for what in English is called Scotland.

==Etymology and derivations==
The name of &quot;Scotland&quot; is derived from the Latin &quot;Scotia&quot;. The word &quot;Scoti&quot; (or &quot;Scotti&quot;) was first used by the Romans. It is found in Latin texts from the 4th century describing an Irish group that raided Roman Britain. It came to be applied to all Gaels. It is not believed that any Gaelic groups called themselves &quot;Scoti&quot; in ancient times, except when writing in Latin. Old Irish documents use the term &quot;Scot&quot; (plural &quot;Scuit&quot;) going back as far as the 9th century; for example, in the glossary of Cormac mac Cuilennáin.

Oman derived it from &quot;Scuit&quot; (modern Gaelic &quot;&quot;), meaning someone cut off. He believed it referred to bands of outcast Gaelic raiders, suggesting that the Scots were to the Gaels what the Vikings were to the Norse.

The 19th-century author Aonghas MacCoinnich of Glasgow proposed that &quot;Scoti&quot; was derived from a Gaelic ethnonym (proposed by MacCoinnich) &quot;Sgaothaich&quot; from &quot;sgaoth&quot; &quot;swarm&quot;, plus the derivational suffix &quot;-ach&quot; (plural &quot;-aich&quot;). However, this proposal to date has not been met with any response in mainstream place-name studies.
Pope Leo X (1513–1521) decreed that the use of the name Scotia be confined to referring to land that is now Scotland.

Virtually all names for Scotland are based on the &quot;Scotia&quot; root (cf. Dutch &quot;Schotland&quot;, French &quot;Écosse&quot;, Czech &quot;Skotsko&quot;, Zulu &quot;IsiKotilandi&quot;, Māori &quot;Koterana&quot;, Hakka &quot;Sû-kak-làn&quot;, Quechua &quot;Iskusya&quot;, Turkish &quot;İskoçya&quot; etc.), either directly or via intermediate languages. The only exceptions are the Celtic languages, where the names are based on the Alba root; e.g., Manx &quot;Nalbin&quot;, Welsh &quot;Yr Alban&quot;, Irish &quot;Albain.&quot;

==Medieval usage==

Scotia translates to &quot;Land of the Scots&quot;. It was a way of saying &quot;Land of the Gaels&quot; (compare &quot;Angli&quot; and &quot;Anglia&quot;; &quot;Franci&quot; and &quot;Francia&quot;; &quot;Romani&quot; and &quot;Romania&quot;; etc). It was initially used as a name for Ireland, originally with ethnic connotations, for example in Adomnán&#x27;s &quot;Life of Columba&quot;, or by Isidore of Seville, who wrote in 580 CE that &quot;Scotia and Hibernia are the same country&quot; (Isidore, lib. xii. c. 6). This is how it was used, for instance, by King Robert I of Scotland (Robert the Bruce) and Domhnall Ua Néill during the Scottish Wars of Independence, when Ireland was called &quot;Scotia Maior&quot; (greater Scotia) and Scotland &quot;Scotia Minor&quot; (lesser Scotia).

After the 11th century, &quot;Scotia&quot; was used mostly for the kingdom of Alba, or Scotland, and in this way became the fixed designation. As a translation of &quot;Alba&quot;, &quot;Scotia&quot; could mean both the whole kingdom belonging to the King of Scots, or just Scotland north of the Forth.

Pope Leo X of the Roman Catholic Church eventually granted Scotland exclusive right over the word, and this led to Anglo-Scottish takeovers of continental Gaelic monasteries (e.g., the &quot;Schottenklöster&quot;).

==In Irish sources==

One of the oldest sources recorded was from medieval Monarchy. In the year 1005, after Brian Boru was crowned king, he adopted the title Imperator Scotorum, &quot;Emperor of the Scoti&quot; suggesting he saw himself as the overlord of all Scotia and Gaels. The title was however adopted and not formally provided. 

Within Irish Mythology, Geoffrey Keating&#x27;s &quot;Foras Feasa ar Éirinn&quot;, Ireland&#x27;s &quot;ninth name was Scotia; and it is the sons of Míleadh who gave that name to it, from their mother, whose name was Scota, daughter of Pharao Nectonibus; or it is why they called it Scotia, because that they are themselves the Scottish race from Scythia&quot;. According to the Middle Irish language synthetic history &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot;, she was the daughter of Pharaoh Necho II of Egypt. Other sources say that Scota was the daughter of Pharaoh Neferhotep I of Egypt and his wife Senebsen, and was the wife of Míl, that is Milesius, and the mother of Éber Donn and Érimón. Míl had given Neferhotep military aid against ancient Ethiopia and was given Scota in marriage as a reward for his services. Writing in 1571, Edmund Campion named the pharaoh Amenophis; Keating named him Cincris.

==Other uses==
In geography, the term is also used for the following:
* the Canadian province of Nova Scotia (New Scotland)
* the village of Scotia in New York State
* the Scotia-Glenville High School in New York State named after a Scottish settler
* the Scotia Sea between Antarctica and South America
* the Scotia Plate, a tectonic plate located to the south of South America

The term also is used/for the following purposes;
* to describe a piece of wood millwork that is used at the base of columns and in stair construction
* Scotiabank, a trade name for the Bank of Nova Scotia
* (rarely) as a feminine first name
* Pride Scotia, Scotland&#x27;s national LGBT pride festival, involving a march and a community based festival held in June

<text>Bunge Global SA (&quot;BUN-ghee&quot;) is a global agribusiness and food company, incorporated in Geneva, Switzerland and headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, United States. 

As well as being an international soybean exporter, it is also involved in food processing, grain trading, and fertilizer. It competes with Archer Daniels Midland, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus. The company has approximately 32,000 employees in 40 countries.

== History ==
===Formation and listing===

Bunge was founded in 1818 by Johann Peter Gottlieb Bunge in Amsterdam, it was relocated to Antwerp by Edouard Bunge in 1859. Edouard&#x27;s brother; Ernest Bunge, took the Bunge name to Argentina in 1884, and in 1905 the business extended to Brazil and later on to the United States. The company was converted into the Bermuda-registered Bunge International in 1994, retaining the Bunge y Born name only in Argentina. Bunge remained a privately held company of 180 shareholders (including the longtime controlling family interests) and divested itself in 1998 of almost all its retail foods interests in favor of a greater role in international agribusiness and commodity markets; by then the company&#x27;s gross annual turnover had reached US$13 billion. Bunge ultimately went public on the New York Stock Exchange in 2001, becoming Bunge Limited.

In 1994, the Bermuda-registered Bunge International was created as the main company in which the families had shares. There were around 180 shareholders—the main families were Hirsch, Bunge, Born, Engels, and De La Tour. This replaced the older structure in which individual shareholders had stakes in all the different Bunge companies. Now only in Argentina does the Bunge y Born name still exist.
In 2001, under the leadership of Alberto Weisser, Bunge was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Through their three businesses—agribusiness, fertilizer, and food products—they have established a leading global presence in the farm-to-consumer food chain. Bunge is the world&#x27;s largest oilseed processor, the world&#x27;s number one seller of bottled vegetable oil to consumers and the largest producer and supplier of fertilizers to farmers in South America.

===Acquisitions===
In 2002, Bunge acquired Cereol, parent of oilseed companies Central Soya and CanAmera Foods. In 2008, Bunge acquired Walter Rau, a margarine company, from Germany. In 2009, Bunge acquired the margarine business from Raisio Group, maker of functional food ingredients. In 2017, Bunge announced intentions to acquire a 70% stake in IOI Loders Croklaan for $946 million from Malaysian palm oil producer IOI Corp Berhad.

=== Brazilian sourcing protests ===

In 2012, Bunge came under criticism from NGO Survival International for sourcing its sugarcane from the ancestral land of the Guaraní people in Brazil. It has been reported by the tribe that crop production has brought pesticides and machinery that has damaged their health, as well as restricting them to a small area that has prevented them from hunting and practicing their traditions. Also, in January 2003, opposition from the tribe had led to the killing of their chief Marcus Vernon by ranchers. In 2012, survivors were requesting Bunge follows the example of the company Raízen, which agreed to stop the sourcing of sugarcane from the area.

In May 2017, Glencore in Switzerland began pursuing the acquisition of Bunge. In early June 2017, Bunge hired advisers to help it fend off Glencore&#x27;s takeover interest. In January 2017, Archer Daniels Midland agreed to sell its crop risk services (insurance) unit to Validus Holdings for $127.5 million. On January 19, 2018, it was reported that Archer Daniels Midland had approached Bunge Ltd. about a takeover, with details &quot;unclear.&quot; At that point, Bunge had a market value of about $9.8 billion, and was still being pursued by Glencore.

In 2019, Bunge relocated its global headquarters from White Plains, New York, to the St Louis metropolitan area in 2020, where the company had its US headquarters.

In April 2020, Bunge announced it agreed to sell 35 U.S interior grain elevators to Zen-Noh Corporation. The completion of the sale was subject to regulatory approval and closed in December 2021. 

In 2021, Bunge was ranked 18th on FoodTalks&#x27; Global Top 40 Plant Protein Producers list. 

A 2023, Bloomberg Businessweek described Bunge&#x27;s food science pivot.

In 2023, a merger with Viterra was announced.

==Environmental record==

In 2006, the United States Environmental Protection Agency filed charges against Bunge company regarding pollution emissions. This involved twelve soybean processing plants and corn mills in eight states throughout the US. The lawsuit claimed Bunge violated the Clean Air Act by constructing major modifications that increased emissions. Bunge was required to implement engineering changes and pollution control projects, estimated to cost $12 million, to reduce emissions at the facilities by 2,200 tons a year. The settlement also called for Bunge to pay a cash penalty of $625,000 and to spend $1.25 million to fund community-based environmental projects selected by and to be supervised by the impacted states. 

== Biofuel production ==

In November 2005, Bunge created a Europe production joint venture biodiesel with French company KBBV and Diester Industrie. The new company received the name Diester Industrie International. The joint venture will produce biodiesel in Germany, Austria and Italy. The total capacity of the plants will reach 430 thousand tons biodiesel per year.

== Tax dodging ==
A noteworthy case of transfer mispricing came to light in 2011 in Argentina involving the world’s four largest grain traders: ADM, Bunge, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus Company. Argentina’s revenue and customs service began an investigation into the four companies when prices for agricultural commodities spiked in 2008 and yet very little profit for the four companies had been reported to the office. As a result of the investigation, it was alleged that the companies had submitted false declarations of sales and routed profits through tax havens or through their headquarters. In some cases, they were said to have used phantom firms to buy grain and had inflated costs in Argentina in order to reduce the recorded profits earned in the country. According to the country’s revenue and customs service, the outstanding taxes amounted to almost USD 1 billion. The companies involved have denied the allegations. To date, the Argentinian tax authorities have not replied to the Swiss NGO Public Eye’s request regarding the current state of the case. In its 2018 annual report to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Bunge mentioned provisions which suggest that the case is still ongoing: “[A]s of December 31, 2018, Bunge’s Argentine subsidiary had received income tax assessments relating to 2006 through 2009 of approximately 1,276 million Argentine pesos (approximately $34 million), plus applicable interest on the outstanding amount of approximately 4,246 million Argentine pesos (approximately $113 million]).”

<doc id="54999" wikidata="Q1331230" url="?curid=54999" title="Forbidden Planet">
<text>Forbidden Planet is a 1956 American science fiction film from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, produced by Nicholas Nayfack, and directed by Fred M. Wilcox from a script by Cyril Hume that was based on a film story by Allen Adler and Irving Block. It stars Walter Pidgeon, Anne Francis, and Leslie Nielsen. Shot in Eastmancolor and CinemaScope, this landmark film is considered one of the great science fiction films of the 1950s, a precursor of contemporary science fiction cinema. The characters and isolated setting have been compared to those in William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot;, and the plot contains certain happenings analogous to the play, leading many to consider it a loose adaptation.

&quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; pioneered several aspects of science fiction cinema. It was the first science fiction film to depict humans traveling in a man-made faster-than-light starship. It was also the first to be set entirely on a planet orbiting another star, far away from Earth and the Solar System. The Robby the Robot character is one of the first film robots that was more than just a mechanical &quot;tin can&quot; on legs; Robby displays a distinct personality and is an integral supporting character in the film. Outside science fiction, the film was groundbreaking as the first of any genre to use an entirely electronic musical score, courtesy of Bebe and Louis Barron.

&quot;Forbidden Planet&quot;″s effects team was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Special Effects at the 29th Academy Awards. Tony Magistrale describes it as one of the best examples of early techno-horror. In 2013, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==

In the 23rd century, after more than a year&#x27;s journey, the United Planets starship &quot;C-57D&quot; arrives at the distant planet Altair IV to determine the fate of the ship &quot;Bellerophon&quot;, sent there 20 years before. Dr. Edward Morbius, one of the original expedition&#x27;s scientists, warns the ship not to land for safety reasons, but Commander John J. Adams ignores his warning.

Adams and Lieutenants Jerry Farman and &quot;Doc&quot; Ostrow are met by Robby the Robot, who transports them to Morbius&#x27; residence. Morbius describes how all other members of their expedition had been killed, one by one, by an unseen &quot;planetary force&quot;, with the &quot;Bellerophon&quot; being vaporized as the last survivors tried to escape. Only Morbius, his wife (who Morbius claims later died of natural causes), and their daughter Altaira were somehow immune. Morbius offers to help the starship return home, but Adams says he must receive further instructions from Earth.
The next day, Adams finds Farman kissing Altaira. Furious, he rebukes Farman and criticizes Altaira for wearing revealing clothing. That night, an invisible intruder sabotages communications equipment aboard the starship. The next morning, Adams and Ostrow go to Morbius&#x27; residence to discuss the intrusion. While waiting, Adams happens upon Altaira swimming. After she dons a new, less revealing dress, Adams apologizes for his behavior toward her, and they kiss. They are suddenly attacked by Altaira&#x27;s pet tiger, and Adams is forced to disintegrate it with his blaster.

Morbius appears and tells Adams and Ostrow that he has been studying artifacts of the Krell, a highly advanced race that mysteriously perished in a single night 200,000 years before. One such device enhances the intellect, which Morbius had used. He barely survived, but his intellectual capacity had doubled. Another is a vast underground machine, still functioning, powered by 9,200 thermonuclear reactors. Adams tells Morbius he must share these discoveries with Earth, but Morbius refuses, saying, &quot;Humanity is not yet ready to receive such limitless power.&quot;

Adams erects a force field fence around the starship, but the unseen intruder easily passes through and brutally murders Chief Engineer Quinn, who was repairing the damaged communications equipment. Morbius warns Adams of his premonition of further deadly attacks. That night, the intruder is detected approaching. Its outline and features become visible when it enters the force field and blasters are fired at it, to little effect. The thing kills Farman and two other crewmen. When Morbius is awakened by Altaira&#x27;s screams, the creature suddenly vanishes.

Adams tries to persuade Altaira to leave. Ostrow sneaks away and uses the Krell intellect enhancer but is fatally injured. Before dying, he informs Adams that the underground machine&#x27;s purpose was to create anything by mere thought, anywhere on the planet. However, he tells Adams the Krell forgot one thing: &quot;Monsters from the id.&quot; The machine gave the Krell&#x27;s own subconscious desires free rein with unlimited power, causing their own extinction. Adams deduces that Morbius&#x27;s subconscious created the thing that both killed the original expedition members and attacked his crewmen; Morbius refuses to believe him.

Altaira tells Morbius that she is leaving Altair IV with Adams. Robby detects the creature approaching; Morbius commands Robby to kill it, but the robot knows it is Morbius and shuts down, being programmed to never kill a human. Adams, Altaira, and Morbius hide in the Krell lab, but the creature melts its way through the thick doors. Morbius finally accepts the truth and confronts and disowns his other self, but is fatally injured by the creature as it vanishes. Before he dies, he has Adams activate a planetary self-destruct system, warning them to be far away in deep space. At a safe distance, Adams, Altaira, Robby, and the surviving crew witness the obliteration of Altair IV. Adams reassures Altaira that in about a million years, the human race will stand where the Krell did. They embrace as &quot;C-57D&quot; heads back to Earth.

==Cast==
==Production==

The screenplay by Irving Block and Allen Adler, written in 1952, was originally titled &quot;Fatal Planet&quot;. The later screenplay draft by Cyril Hume renamed the film &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot;, because this was believed to have greater box-office appeal. Block and Adler&#x27;s drama took place in the year 1976 on the planet Mercury. An Earth expedition headed by John Grant is sent to the planet to retrieve Dr. Adams and his daughter Dorianne, who have been stranded there for twenty years. In this version, there is no Krell or a monster from the ID. The invisible ape-like beast simply appears to be a native of Mercury. Hume&#x27;s first story outline from November 1952 fleshed out and rewrote much of the original concept.

The film sets for &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; were constructed on a Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) sound stage at its Culver City film lot and were designed by Cedric Gibbons and Arthur Lonergan. The film was shot entirely indoors, with all the Altair IV exterior scenes simulated using sets, visual effects, and matte paintings. As the art director of the film, Lonergan took the liberty to build sets that were much larger than the budget allowed. The sets were already half done when the budget department found out and it was too late to do anything about it.

A full-size mock-up of roughly three-quarters of the starship was built to suggest its full width of 170 ft (51 m). The starship was surrounded by a huge, painted cyclorama featuring the desert landscape of Altair IV; this one set took up all of the available space in one of the Culver City sound stages. Principal photography took place from April 18 to late May 1955.

At a cost of roughly $125,000, Robby the Robot was very expensive for a film prop at this time; it represented almost 7% of the film&#x27;s $1.9 million budget and equates to at least $1 million in 2017 dollars. Both the electrically controlled passenger vehicle driven by Robby and the truck/tractor-crane off-loaded from the starship were also constructed especially for this film. Robby later starred in the science fiction film &quot;The Invisible Boy&quot; (1957) and appeared in many TV series and films.

The animated sequences of &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot;, especially the attack of the Id Monster, were created by veteran animator Joshua Meador, who was loaned to MGM by Walt Disney Productions. According to a &quot;Behind the Scenes&quot; featurette on the film&#x27;s DVD, a close look at the creature shows it to have a small goatee beard, suggesting its connection to Dr. Morbius, the only character with this physical feature. Unusually, the scene in which the Id Monster is finally revealed during its attack on the Earth ship was not created using traditional cel animation. Instead, Meador simply sketched each frame of the entire sequence in black pencil on animation stand translucent vellum paper; each page was then photographed in high contrast, so that only the major details remained visible. These images were then photographically reversed into negative and the resulting white line images were then tinted red, creating the effect of the Id Monster&#x27;s body remaining largely invisible, with only its major outlines illuminated by the energy from the force-field and blaster beams. The monster was considered so scary that in some states its image was edited out of the film so as to not frighten children. Meador was also responsible for the other visual effects, like the ray gun beams and disintegration scenes.

Although workprints of cinema films were normally destroyed, the workprint of &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; was not destroyed, and was discovered in 1977. There are differences in characterization, dialogue and scenes between the workprint and the release print.

==Reception==
&quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; had its world premiere at the Southeastern Science Fiction Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, on March 3 and 4, 1956. The film opened in more than 100 cities on March 23 in CinemaScope, Eastmancolor, and in some theaters, stereophonic sound, either by the magnetic or Perspecta processes.

At the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a rating of 94% based on 51 reviews from critics, averaging 8.20/10. Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that everyone who worked on the film certainly &quot;had a barrel of fun with it. And, if you&#x27;ve got an ounce of taste for crazy humor, you&#x27;ll have a barrel of fun, too.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; wrote: &quot;Imaginative gadgets galore, plus plenty of suspense and thrills, make the Nicholas Nayfack production a top offering in the space travel category.&quot; &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; called the film &quot;weird but fascinating and exciting&quot;, with &quot;highly imaginative&quot; production. Philip K. Scheuer of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that the film was &quot;more than another science-fiction movie, with the emphasis on fiction; it is a genuinely thought-through concept of the future, and the production MGM has bestowed on it gives new breadth and dimension to that time-worn phrase, &#x27;out of this world.&#x27;&quot; John McCarten of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; called the film &quot;a pleasant spoof of all the moonstruck nonsense the movies have been dishing up about what goes on among our neighbors out there in interstellar space.&quot; &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; of Britain praised the film as &quot;an enjoyably thorough-going space fantasy&quot;, adding, &quot;In tone the film adroitly combines naivete with sophistication, approaching its inter-planetary heroics with a cheerful consciousness of their absurdity that still allows for one or two genuinely weird and exciting moments, such as the monster&#x27;s first advance on the spaceship.&quot; The Philadelphia film critic Steve Friedman (&quot;Mr. Movie&quot;) told interviewers that &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; was his favorite film. He watched it 178 times.

According to MGM records, the film initially earned $1,530,000 in the U.S. and Canada and $1,235,000 elsewhere resulting in a profit of $210,000.

&quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; was re-released to film theaters during 1972 as one of MGM&#x27;s &quot;Kiddie Matinee&quot; features; it was missing about six minutes of film footage cut to ensure it received a G rating from the Motion Picture Association of America, including a 1950s-style muted scene of Anne Francis, which made it seem she swam without a bathing suit. Later video releases carry a G rating, although they are all the original theatrical version.

The American Film Institute nominated the film as one of its top-10 science fiction films. The score was nominated for AFI&#x27;s 100 Years of Film Scores.

==Home media==
&quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; was first released in the pan and scan format in 1981 on MGM VHS and Betamax videotape and on MGM laser disc and CED Videodisc; years later, in 1996, it was again re-issued by MGM/UA, but this time in widescreen VHS and laserdisc, both for the film&#x27;s 40th anniversary. The Criterion Collection later re-issued &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; in CinemaScope&#x27;s original 2.55:1 aspect ratio for the first time, on a deluxe laserdisc set with various extra features on a second disc. Warner Bros. next released the film on DVD in 1999 (MGM&#x27;s catalog of films has since remained under ownership of Turner Entertainment, currently a division of Warner Bros. Discovery). Warner&#x27;s release offered both cropped and widescreen picture formats on the same disc.
For the film&#x27;s 50th anniversary, the Ultimate Collector&#x27;s Edition was released on November 28, 2006, in an oversized red metal box, using the original film poster for its wraparound cover. Both DVD and high definition HD DVD formats were available in this deluxe package. Inside both premium packages were the films &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; and &quot;The Invisible Boy&quot;, &quot;The Thin Man&quot; episode &quot;Robot Client&quot; (&quot;Robby The Robot&quot;, one of the film&#x27;s co-stars, was also a guest star in both &quot;The Thin Man&quot; episode and &quot;The Invisible Boy&quot;) and a documentary &quot;Watch the Skies!: Science Fiction, The 1950s and Us&quot;. Also included were miniature lobby cards and an 8 cm (3-inch) toy replica of Robby the Robot. This was quickly followed by the release of the &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; 50th Anniversary edition in both standard DVD and HD DVD packaging. Both 50th anniversary formats were mastered by Warner Bros.-MGM techs from a fully restored, digital transfer of the film. A Blu-ray edition of &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; was released on September 7, 2010.

==Novelization==

Shortly before the film was released, a novelization appeared in hardcover and then later in mass-market paperback; it was written by W. J. Stuart (the pseudonym of mystery novelist Philip MacDonald), which chapters the novel into separate first person narrations by Dr. Ostrow, Commander Adams, and Dr. Morbius. The novel delves further into the mysteries of the vanished Krell and Morbius&#x27; relationship to them. In the novel, he repeatedly exposes himself to the Krell&#x27;s manifestation machine, which (as suggested in the film) boosts his brain power far beyond normal human intelligence. Unfortunately, Morbius retains enough of his imperfect human nature to be afflicted with hubris and a contempt for humanity. Not recognizing his own base primitive drives and limitations proves to be Morbius&#x27; downfall, as it had for the extinct Krell. While not stated explicitly in the film (although the basis for a deleted scene first included as an extra with the Criterion Collection&#x27;s LaserDisc set and included with both the later 50th anniversary DVD and current Blu-ray releases), the novelization compared Altaira&#x27;s ability to tame the tiger (until her sexual awakening with Commander Adams) to the medieval myth of a unicorn being tamable only by a virgin.

The novel also includes some elements never included in the film: For one, Adams, Farman, and Ostrow clandestinely observe Morbius&#x27; house overnight one evening, but see or hear nothing. When they leave they accidentally kill one of Altaira&#x27;s pet monkeys. When Dr. Ostrow later on dissects the dead animal he discovers that its internal structure precludes it from ever having been alive in the normal biological sense. The tiger, deer, and monkeys are all conscious creations by Dr. Morbius as companions (&quot;pets&quot;) for his daughter and only outwardly resemble their Earth counterparts. The novel also differs somewhat from the film in that it does not directly establish the great machine as the progenitor of the animals or monster; instead only attributes them to Morbius&#x27; elevated mental power. The Krell&#x27;s self-destruction can be interpreted by the reader as a cosmic punishment for misappropriating the life-creating power of God. This is why in the film&#x27;s ending, Commander Adams says in his speech to Altaira &quot;...we are, after all, not God&quot;. The novel ends with a postscript making a similar observation.

==Soundtrack==
&quot;Forbidden Planet&quot;″s innovative electronic music score (credited as &quot;electronic tonalities&quot; due to disputes with the musicians&#x27; union) was composed by Bebe and Louis Barron. The two were originally slated to contribute about twenty minutes of sound effects and electronic pieces, as avant-garde composer Harry Partch was also due to contribute music. When Partch left the project, the Barrons took over the entire soundtrack. MGM producer Dore Schary had been approached by them at a nightclub in Greenwich Village while on a family Christmas visit to New York City, where they asked if he was interested in listening to a demonstration of their electronic music. Schary told them he was returning to California the next morning, but to assuage their disappointment, he promised to give them a chance if they ever came to California. Assuming he had heard the last of them, he was surprised when they showed up in Hollywood a few weeks later. Keeping his promise, he listened to their music, and after a consultation with the head of MGM&#x27;s music department Johnny Green and the movie&#x27;s producer Nicholas Nayfack, he agreed to hire them. When they declined to have all their equipment transferred from New York to Hollywood for a three-month job, the studio agreed, and the movie became MGM&#x27;s first production to have its score produced outside of the studio lot. While the theremin had been used on the soundtracks of &quot;Spellbound&quot; (1945) and &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot; (1951), the Barrons are credited with creating the first completely electronic film score, preceding the development of analog synthesizers by Robert Moog and Don Buchla in the early 1960s.

Using ideas and procedures from the book &quot;&quot; (1948) by the mathematician and electrical engineer Norbert Wiener, Louis Barron constructed his own electronic circuits that he used to generate the score&#x27;s &quot;bleeps, blurps, whirs, whines, throbs, hums, and screeches&quot;, making heavy use of ring modulation. After recording the basic sounds, the Barrons further manipulated the sounds with reverberation, delay, filters, and tape manipulations (as employed in the piece &quot;Williams Mix&quot;, which they had assisted John Cage in realizing at their Greenwich Village studio).

Since Bebe and Louis Barron did not belong to the Musicians Union, their work could not be considered for an Academy Award in either the &quot;soundtrack&quot; or &quot;sound effects&quot; categories; this also necessitated the &quot;electronic tonalities&quot; credit. MGM declined to publish a soundtrack album at the time that &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; was released; however, film composer and conductor David Rose later published a 7-inch (18 cm) single of his original main title theme that he had recorded at the MGM studios in March 1956. Rose was originally hired to compose the musical score in 1955, but his main title theme was discarded when he was discharged from the project by Dore Schary in late December of that year. The film&#x27;s original theatrical trailer contains snippets of Rose&#x27;s score, the tapes of which he reportedly later destroyed.

The Barrons finally released their soundtrack in 1976 as an LP album for the film&#x27;s 20th anniversary; it was on their very own Planet Records label (later changed to Small Planet Records and distributed by GNP Crescendo Records). The LP premiered at MidAmeriCon, the 34th World Science Fiction Convention, held in Kansas City, Missouri, over the 1976 Labor Day weekend, as part of a 20th Anniversary celebration of &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; held at that Worldcon; the Barrons were there promoting their album&#x27;s first release, signing all the copies sold at the convention. They also introduced the first of three packed-house screenings that showed an MGM 35mm fine-grain vault print in original CinemaScope and stereophonic sound. A decade later, in 1986, their soundtrack was released on a music CD for the film&#x27;s 30th Anniversary, with a six-page color booklet containing images from &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot;, plus liner notes from the composers and Bill Malone.

A tribute to the film&#x27;s soundtrack was performed live in concert by Jack Dangers, and is available on disc one of the album &quot;Forbidden Planet Explored&quot;.

==Costumes and props==
The costumes worn by Anne Francis were designed by Helen Rose. Her miniskirts resulted in &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; being banned in Spain; it was not shown there until 1967. Other costumes were designed by Walter Plunkett.

Robby the Robot was operated at first by diminutive stuntman Frankie Darro. He was fired shortly after an early scene because of his having consumed a five-martini lunch prior to the scene being shot; he nearly fell over while attempting to walk while inside the expensive prop.

Many costume and prop items were reused in several different episodes of the television series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, most of which were filmed by Rod Serling&#x27;s Cayuga Productions at the MGM studio in Culver City, including Robby the Robot, the various &quot;C-57D&quot; models, the full-scale mock-up of the base of the ship (which featured in the episodes &quot;To Serve Man&quot; and &quot;On Thursday We Leave for Home&quot;), the blaster pistols and rifles, crew uniforms, and special effects shots.

In late September 2015, several screen-used items from &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; were offered in Profiles in History&#x27;s Hollywood Auction 74, including Walter Pidgeon&#x27;s &quot;Morbius&quot; costume, an illuminating blaster rifle, blaster pistol, a force field generator post, and an original Sascha Brastoff steel prehistoric fish sculpture seen outside Morbius&#x27; home; also offered were several lobby cards and publicity photos.
On November 2, 2017, the original Robby the Robot prop was offered for auction by Bonhams, and it earned US$5.3 million, including the buyer&#x27;s premium. It set a new record for TCM-Bonhams auctions, surpassing the US$4 million earned for a Maltese Falcon in 2013, making it the most valuable film prop ever sold at auction.

==In popular culture==
An Australian radio adaptation using the original electronic music and noted local actors was broadcast in June 1959 on &quot;The Caltex Radio Theatre&quot;.

In Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;The Tommyknockers&quot;, Altair-4 is frequently referenced as the home planet of the titular alien presence.

In the authorized biography of &quot;Star Trek&quot; creator Gene Roddenberry, biographer David Alexander notes that &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; was an inspiration for &quot;Star Trek&quot; and quotes a memo by Roddenberry in which he explicitly avoids copying the mechanics of &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot;&#x27;s spaceship, but hopes for it to &quot;stimulate our own thinking&quot; in regards to the production of the still-in-development &quot;Star Trek&quot; TV series. In the opening scene of the movie, the navigator says &quot;We&#x27;ll reach D.C. point at 1701&quot;. The registration number for the USS Enterprise is NCC-1701. There were many references to Altair IV in &quot;Star Trek&quot;. In a scene from &quot;Star Trek III: The Search For Spock&quot; (1984) Dr. McCoy visits a bar and orders &quot;Altair Water&quot;.

Elements of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;Planet of Evil&quot; were consciously based on &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot;.

In the novel &quot;Strata&quot; by Terry Pratchett the main characters get stranded on a disc world which is driven completely by underground machinery. Close to the end, an explicit reference is made: &quot;Didn&#x27;t you ever see &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot;? Human movie. They remade it five, six times&quot;.

&quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; and star Anne Francis are named alongside ten other classic science fiction films in the opening song &quot;Science Fiction Double Feature&quot; in the stage musical &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot; and its subsequent film adaptation.

The British musical &quot;Return to the Forbidden Planet&quot; was inspired by and loosely based on the MGM film, and won the Olivier Award for best musical of 1989/90.

A scene from the science fiction TV series &quot;Babylon 5&quot;, set on the Epsilon III Great Machine bridge, strongly resembles the Krell&#x27;s great machine. While this was not the intent of the show&#x27;s producer, the special effects crew, tasked with creating the imagery, stated that the Krell&#x27;s machine was a definite influence on their Epsilon III designs. Also, Season 2 episode 5 &quot;The Long Dark&quot; features an invisible creature, that when shot is made visible with very similar effects as the invisible creature from Forbidden Planet.

&quot;The Time Tunnel&quot; pilot episode featured a matte shot of huge underground buildings and people running across a walkway above a giant power generator, in homage to the scene of the Krell&#x27;s underground complex.

&quot;The Outer Limits&quot; episode &quot;The Man with the Power&quot; revisits the premise of a person&#x27;s subconscious manifesting as a destructive, murderous entity.

For the film&#x27;s 50th anniversary in 2006, DAW Books released an original mass-market paperback anthology of new science fiction short stories, &quot;Forbidden Planets&quot;, all of which were inspired by the film.

&quot;Out of the Silent Planet&quot;, a song on Iron Maiden&#x27;s album Brave New World, is based on &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot;.

&quot;&quot; DLC Old World Blues uses multiple references, including Doctor Mobius as a reference to Morbius in the film, the protectrons being modeled after Robby the Robot, and The Forbidden Dome being based on the film&#x27;s title.

In the first &quot;Mass Effect&quot; game, while examining the planets in the Gagarin system of the Armstrong Nebula, specifically on the planet&#x27;s Junthor survey feed, a reference is made to &quot;Monsters from the id&quot;.

Author George R. R. Martin cites &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; as his favorite science fiction film and states that he owns a working full-size Robby the Robot replica.

In the &quot;Firefly&quot; film &quot;Serenity&quot;, one of the vehicles they examine on the planet Miranda has &quot;C-57D&quot; stenciled on its side.

In the &quot;Columbo&quot; (TV series) episode &quot;Mind Over Mayhem&quot; (1974), a robot called &quot;MM7&quot; is featured. Its top half is almost identical to Robby the Robot as he appears in the 1956 film. Differences in the hands, chest panel, and a metal skirting replacing the legs suggest it is not the original film prop.

In the &quot;Castle&quot; episode &quot;Law &amp; Murder&quot; (2011) &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; is playing at the &quot;Angelika Film Center&quot;. Castle, who is a fan of the film, invites his daughter to go with him to see it, but she has made other plans. At the end of the episode, Beckett tells Castle she is going to see it, and by feigning ignorance (&quot;&quot;Forbidden Planet&quot;? Is...Is that the one with the robot?&quot;) Castle succeeds in getting Beckett to treat him to see the film.

Robby the Robot makes many cameo appearances in television and film. Examples include episodes of &quot;The Perry Como Show&quot;, &quot;Hazel&quot;, &quot;The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis&quot;, &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, &quot;The Banana Splits&quot;, &quot;Mork and Mindy&quot;, &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;, &quot;The Man from UNCLE&quot;, &quot;Ark II&quot;, &quot;Lost in Space&quot;, &quot;Space Academy&quot;, &quot;Project UFO&quot; and &quot;The Love Boat&quot;. Robby was also featured in the films &quot;Cherry 2000&quot;, &quot;Gremlins&quot;, &quot;The Invisible Boy&quot;, &quot;Invasion of the Neptune Men&quot;, &quot;Hollywood Boulevard&quot;, and &quot;Dünyayı Kurtaran Adam&quot;. He also has appeared on numerous magazine covers, record sleeves, and in some TV commercials.

==Remake==
New Line Cinema had developed a remake with James Cameron, Nelson Gidding, and Stirling Silliphant involved at different times. In 2007, DreamWorks set up the project with David Twohy set to direct. Warner Bros. re-acquired the rights the following year and on October 31, 2008, J. Michael Straczynski was announced as writing a remake, Joel Silver was to produce. Straczynski explained that the original had been his favorite science fiction film, and it gave Silver an idea for the new film that makes it &quot;not a remake&quot;, &quot;not a re-imagining&quot;, and &quot;not exactly a prequel&quot;. His vision for the film would not be retro, because when the original was made it was meant to be futuristic. Straczynski met with people working in astrophysics, planetary geology, and artificial intelligence to reinterpret the Krell back-story as a film trilogy. In March 2009, Straczynski reported that the project was abandoned, and that a new script was requested.

On November 15, 2024, Brian K. Vaughan was announced to be writing a new screenplay for the remake.

<text>The Quebec Act 1774 () was an act of the Parliament of Great Britain which set procedures of governance in the Province of Quebec. One of the principal components of the act was the expansion of the province&#x27;s territory to take over part of the Indian Reserve, including much of what is now southern Ontario, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin, and parts of Minnesota.

The act removed the reference to the Protestant faith from the oath of allegiance, and guaranteed free practice of Catholicism and restored the Church&#x27;s power to impose tithes. Additionally, it restored the use of the French civil law for matters of private law, except for the granting of unlimited freedom of testation in accordance with English common law; which was maintained for matters of public law, including administrative appeals, court procedure, and criminal prosecution.

In Quebec, English-speaking immigrants from the Thirteen Colonies fiercely objected to a variety of its provisions, which they saw as a removal of certain political freedoms. The act was one of the many catalysts that led to the American Revolution. Meanwhile, French-speaking Canadiens varied in their reaction, although the land-owning seigneurs and ecclesiastics were generally happy with its provisions.

In the Thirteen Colonies, the act had been passed in the same session of Parliament as a number of other acts designed as punishment for the Boston Tea Party and other protests, which the American Patriots collectively termed the Intolerable Acts or, in England, the Coercive Acts. Moreover, the act was seen by the colonists as a new model for administration, which would strip them of their self-elected assemblies, and appeared to void some of the colonies&#x27; land claims by granting most of the Ohio Country to the province of Quebec. The Americans also interpreted the Act as an &quot;establishment&quot; of Catholicism in the colony, as many Americans had participated in the French and Indian War, and they now saw the religious freedoms and land given to their former enemy as an affront.

== Background ==

Following the defeat of the Kingdom of France by the Kingdom of Great Britain in the Seven Years&#x27; War, the peace was formalized with the Treaty of Paris of 1763. Under the terms of the treaty, France ceded New France, specifically the French colony of Canada, to Britain as it was considered less valuable, since its only significant commercial product at the time was beaver pelts, choosing instead to keep the islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique for their valuable sugar production. This territory along the St. Lawrence River, called &quot;Canada&quot; by the French, was renamed Quebec by the British, after its capital city. Non-military administration of the territories acquired by the British in the war was defined in the Royal Proclamation of 1763. 

Under the terms of the peace treaty, Canadiens who chose not to leave became British subjects. In order for them to serve in public offices, they were required to swear an oath to the King that contained specific provisions rejecting the Catholic faith. Given that many of the predominantly Roman Catholic Canadiens were unwilling to take such an oath, this effectively prevented large numbers of Canadiens from participating in the local governments. 

With unrest, which was growing into the American Revolution, increasing in the colonies to the south, the British were worried that the Canadiens might also support the growing rebellion. At that time, Canadiens formed the vast majority of the settler population of the province of Quebec (more than 99%) and there was little immigration from Great Britain. To secure the allegiance of the approximately 90,000 Canadiens to the British crown, first Governor James Murray and later Governor Guy Carleton promoted the need for change. 

There was also a need to compromise between the conflicting demands of the Canadien subjects and those of newly arrived British subjects. These efforts by the colonial governors eventually resulted in the enactment of the &quot;Quebec Act, 1774&quot;.

== The act ==
*Territory: The boundaries of the province were defined by the act. In addition to the territory defined by the royal proclamation, the borders were expanded to include land that is now southern Ontario, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin and parts of Minnesota. This increased the size of the province threefold, restoring the territory of the French province of Canada.
* Religion: The Act allowed public office holders to practise the Roman Catholic faith, by replacing the oath sworn by officials from one sworn to Elizabeth I and her heirs, with one sworn to George III that had no reference to the Protestant faith. This enabled, for the first time, Canadiens to legally participate in the affairs of the provincial government without formally renouncing their faith. It also re-established the collection of tithes, which had been stopped under the previous administrative rules.
* Structure of government: The Act defined the structure of the provincial government. The governor was to be appointed by the Crown, and he was to govern with the assistance of a legislative council; there were no provisions for an elected legislative assembly.
* Law: The Royal Proclamation of 1763 had provided that English common law would apply for all purposes in the colony. The act restored the application of the former law of Canada for all matters respecting property and civil rights, while providing that English law would apply in matters of public law, criminal law and freedom of testation.
* Land use: The seigneurial system as a means of distributing land and managing its use was restored. This was the system by which the French had administered the province; the British had instituted a township system of land management in 1763.
* Name of the Act: as was the practice at that time, the act initially only had a long title: &quot;An Act for making more effectual Provision for the Government of the Province of Quebec in North America&quot;. The act was customarily referred to as the &quot;Quebec Act 1774&quot;. In 1898, the British Parliament authorised the use of a short title, the &quot;British North America (Quebec) Act 1774&quot;, but that short title was &quot;without prejudice to any other mode of citation&quot;. In its collection of constitutional enactments, the federal government has continued to refer to the act as the &quot;Quebec Act 1774&quot;.

===Participation of the Canadiens===
The internal communications of the British colonial government at Quebec suggest a relative failure of the purpose of the Quebec Act. On 4 February 1775, Governor Guy Carleton wrote to General Thomas Gage that he believed the Canadiens to be generally happy with the Act, yet he also added:

On June 7, after having received word of the Battles of Lexington and Concord, as well as the capture of Fort Ticonderoga and Benedict Arnold&#x27;s subsequent raid on Fort Saint-Jean, he wrote to Colonial Secretary Dartmouth:

Less than a month later, on 28 June 1775, Chief Justice William Hey wrote to the Lord Chancellor from Quebec:

On 21 September 1775, Lieutenant-Governor Cramahé, who governed at Quebec while Carleton was in Montreal, wrote to Dartmouth on the failure to rally the people after word arrived of the impending invasion from the colonies to the south:

=== Thirteen Colonies ===

The Quebec Act angered some Americans. Along with four punitive acts passed in the same parliamentary session (called the &quot;Coercive Acts&quot; in England), it was termed one of the Intolerable Acts by the Patriots, and contributed to the coming of the American Revolution.

Frontiersmen from Virginia and other colonies were already entering the areas that the act transferred to Quebec. Land development companies such as the Ohio Company had already been formed to acquire ownership of large tracts and sell land to settlers and trade with the Indians. Americans denounced the act for promoting the growth of &quot;Papism&quot; (Catholicism) and cutting back on their freedom and traditional rights. In particular, the colonial governments of New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia were angered by the unilateral assignment of the Ohio lands to Quebec, which had each been granted them in their royal charters. The George Rex protest flag was created in New York as a result.

Langston (2005) looked at press reaction in New England. Some colonial editors explained their views on how it reorganized Canadian governance, explaining how they felt it established direct rule by the Crown and limiting the reach of English law to criminal jurisprudence. Isaiah Thomas of the &quot;Massachusetts Spy&quot; drew links between the &quot;Quebec Act&quot; and legislation circumscribing American liberties, such as the &quot;Tea Act&quot; and the Coercive Acts. Editors shaped public opinion by writing editorials and reprinting opposition letters from both sides of the Atlantic. The First Continental Congress, which met from 5 September to 26 October 1774, addressed the inhabitants of Quebec, warning them of the perils of the supposedly arbitrary and tyrannical nature of Parliament.

The Quebec Act&#x27;s main significance in the Thirteen Colonies was that it angered the Patriots, and dismayed the Loyalists who supported the Crown, and helped to accelerate the confrontation that became the American Revolution. The act is listed as one of the rebels&#x27; 27 colonial grievances in the Declaration of Independence:

The First Continental Congress petitioned Parliament to repeal the Intolerable Acts, which Parliament declined to do. Instead, in February 1775 Parliament passed the Conciliatory Resolution in an attempt to curry favour with the angry colonists. This was too little, too late, as the war broke out before news of its passage could reach the colonies. Although the Continental Congress did eventually receive this proposal, they ultimately rejected it.

In Quebec, the 1774 act was effectively superseded by the Constitutional Act 1791, which partitioned Quebec into two new provinces, Upper and Lower Canada. 

The Quebec Act 1774 is an important predecessor to the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States by establishing religious freedom.

<text>The autonomous communities () are the first-level administrative divisions of Spain, created in accordance with the Spanish Constitution of 1978, with the aim of guaranteeing limited autonomy to the nationalities and regions that make up Spain.

There are 17 autonomous communities and two autonomous cities (Ceuta and Melilla) that are collectively known as &quot;autonomies&quot;. The two autonomous cities have the right to become autonomous communities.

The autonomous communities exercise their right to self-government within the limits set forth in the constitution and organic laws known as Statutes of Autonomy, which broadly define the powers that they assume.

Each statute sets out the devolved powers () for each community; typically those communities with stronger local nationalism have more powers, and this type of devolution has been called &quot;asymmetrical&quot; which is on the whole seen as advantageous, able to respond to diversity.

Despite the Constitution not setting a mandatory legislative chamber framework, all autonomous communities have chosen unicameralism. All such governments have legislative and executive branches of government but not judicial.

==Decentralisation model==

The Spanish model is generally considered by foreign political scientists and scholars as &quot;a federal system with certain peculiarities&quot;. However it is also described as a decentralised unitary country. While sovereignty is vested in the nation as a whole, represented in the central institutions of government, the nation has, to varying degrees, devolved power to the communities.

This unique framework of territorial administration has been labeled by the Constitutional Court as the &quot;State of Autonomous Communities&quot;, to avoid implying either a unitary or federal model. Some scholars have referred to the resulting system as a federal system in all but name, or a &quot;federation without federalism&quot;.

== List of autonomous communities ==
The official names of the autonomous communities can be in Spanish only (which applies to the majority of them), in the co-official language in the community only (as in the Valencian Community and the Balearic Islands), or in both Spanish and the co-official language (as in the Basque Country, Navarre and Galicia). Since 2006, Occitan—in its Aranese dialect—is also a co-official language in Catalonia, making it the only autonomous community whose name has three official variants (Spanish: &quot;Cataluña&quot;, Catalan: &quot;Catalunya&quot;, Occitan: &quot;Catalonha&quot;).

==History==
===Background===

Spain is a diverse country made up of several different regions with varying economic and social structures, as well as different languages and historical, political and cultural traditions. While the entire Spanish territory was united under one crown in 1479, this was not a process of national homogenization or amalgamation. The constituent territories—be they crowns, kingdoms, principalities or dominions—retained much of their former institutional existence, including limited legislative, judicial or fiscal autonomy. These territories also exhibited a variety of local customs, laws, languages and currencies until the mid 19th century.

From the 18th century onwards, the Bourbon kings and the government tried to establish a more centralized regime. Leading figures of the Spanish Enlightenment advocated for the building of a Spanish nation beyond the internal territorial boundaries. This culminated in 1833, when Spain was divided into 49 (now 50) provinces, which served mostly as transmission belts for policies developed in Madrid.

Spanish history since the late 19th century has been shaped by a dialectical struggle between Spanish nationalism and peripheral nationalisms, mostly in Catalonia and the Basque Country, and to a lesser degree in Galicia.

In a response to Catalan demands, limited autonomy was granted to the Commonwealth of Catalonia in 1914, only to be abolished in 1925. It was granted again in 1932 during the Second Spanish Republic, when the Generalitat, Catalonia&#x27;s mediaeval institution of government, was restored. The constitution of 1931 envisaged a territorial division for all Spain in &quot;autonomous regions&quot;, which was never fully attained—only Catalonia, the Basque Country and Galicia had approved &quot;Statutes of Autonomy&quot;—the process being thwarted by the Spanish Civil War that broke out in 1936, and the victory of the rebel Nationalist forces under Francisco Franco.

Franco&#x27;s dictatorial regime strongly believed that the only way of preserving the &quot;unity of the Spanish nation&quot; was by ruling Spain as a highly centralized state. Peripheral nationalism, along with communism and atheism, were regarded by his regime as the main threats. His attempts to fight separatism with heavy-handed but sporadic repression, and his often severe suppression of language and regional identities backfired: the demands for democracy became intertwined with demands for the recognition of a pluralistic vision of Spanish nationhood.

When Franco died in 1975, Spain entered into a phase of transition to democracy. The most difficult task of the newly democratically elected (the Spanish Parliament) in 1977 acting as a Constituent Assembly was to transition from Franco&#x27;s rigid centralism to a more decentralized model in a way that would satisfy the demands of the peripheral nationalists.

The Prime Minister of Spain, Adolfo Suárez, met with Josep Tarradellas, president of the Generalitat of Catalonia in exile. They agreed to restore the Generalitat and transfer limited powers while the constitution was still being written. Shortly after, the government allowed the creation of &quot;assemblies of members of parliament&quot; made up of deputies and senators of the different territories of Spain, so that they could constitute &quot;pre-autonomic regimes&quot; for their regions as well. 

The Fathers of the Constitution had to strike a balance between the opposing views of Spain—on the one hand, the centralist view inherited from monarchist and nationalist elements of Spanish society, and on the other hand federalism and a pluralistic view of Spain as a &quot;nation of nations&quot;; between a uniform decentralization of entities with the same powers and an asymmetrical structure that would distinguish the nationalities. Peripheral nationalist parties wanted a multinational state with a federal or confederal model, whereas the governing Union of the Democratic Centre (UCD) and the People&#x27;s Alliance (AP) wanted minimum decentralization; the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE) was sympathetic to a federal system.

In the end, the constitution, published and ratified in 1978, found a balance in recognizing the existence of &quot;nationalities and regions&quot; in Spain, within the &quot;indissoluble unity of the Spanish nation&quot;. In order to manage the tensions present in the Spanish transition to democracy, the drafters of the current Spanish constitution avoided giving labels such as &#x27;federal&#x27; to the territorial arrangements, while enshrining in the constitution the right to autonomy or self-government of the &quot;nationalities and regions&quot;, through a process of asymmetric devolution of power to the &quot;autonomous communities&quot; that were to be created.

===Constitution of 1978===

The starting point in the territorial organization of Spain was the second article of the constitution, which reads:

The constitution was rather ambiguous on how this was to take place. It does not define, detail, or impose the structure of the state; it does not tell the difference between &quot;nation&quot; and &quot;nationality&quot;; and it does not specify which are the &quot;nationalities&quot; and which are the &quot;regions&quot;, or the territories they comprise. Rather than imposing, it &quot;enables&quot; a process towards a decentralized structure based on the exercise that these &quot;nationalities and regions&quot; would make of the right to self-government that they were granted. As such, the outcome of this exercise was not predictable and its construction was deliberately open-ended; the constitution only created a process for an eventual devolution, but it was voluntary in nature: the &quot;nationalities and regions&quot; themselves had the option of choosing to attain self-government or not.

In order to exercise this right, the constitution established an open process whereby the &quot;nationalities and regions&quot; could be constituted as &quot;autonomous communities&quot;. First, it recognized the pre-existing 50 provinces of Spain, a territorial division of the liberal centralizing regime of the 19th century created for purely administrative purposes (it also recognized the municipalities that integrated the provinces). These provinces would serve as the building blocks and constituent parts of the autonomous communities. The constitution stipulated that the following could be constituted as autonomous communities:
* Two or more adjacent provinces with common historical, cultural and economic characteristics.
* Insular territories.
* A single province with a &quot;historical regional identity&quot;.

It also allowed for exceptions to the above criteria, in that the Spanish Parliament could:
* authorize, in the nation&#x27;s interest, the constitution of an autonomous community even if it was a single province without a historical regional identity (which allowed for example, the creation of the Community of Madrid, which had been part of the historical region of Castile–La Mancha); and to
* authorize or grant autonomy to entities or territories that were not provinces (which allowed for the creation of two autonomous cities, Spanish exclaves in North Africa).

The constitution also established two &quot;routes&quot; to accede to autonomy. The &quot;fast route&quot; or &quot;fast track&quot;, also called the &quot;exception&quot;, was established in article 151, and was implicitly reserved for the three &quot;historical nationalities&quot;—Catalonia, the Basque Country and Galicia, regions with strong regional identities—in that the very strict requirements to opt for this route were waived for those territories that had approved a &quot;Statute of Autonomy&quot; during the Second Spanish Republic (1931–1936). Otherwise, the constitution required the approval of three-fourths of the municipalities involved whose population would be at least the majority of the electoral census of each province, and required the ratification through a referendum with the affirmative vote of the absolute majority of the electoral census of each province (that is, of all registered citizens, not only of those who would vote).

While the constitution was still being drafted, and self-government seemed likely to be granted only to the &quot;historical nationalities&quot;, there was a popular outcry in Andalusia, demanding self-government as well, which led to the creation of a quicker process for that region, which eventually self-identified as a &quot;historical nationality&quot; as well. In the end, the right to self-government was extended to any other region that wanted it.

The &quot;slow route&quot; or &quot;slow track&quot;, also called the &quot;norm&quot;, was established in article 143. This route could be taken—via the first transitory disposition—by the &quot;pre-autonomic regimes&quot; that had been constituted in 1978, while the constitution was still being drafted, if approved by two-thirds of all municipalities involved whose population would sum up to at least the majority of the electoral census of each province or insular territory. These communities would assume limited powers () during a provisional period of 5 years, after which they could assume further powers, upon negotiation with the central government. However, the constitution did not explicitly establish an institutional framework for these communities. They could have established a parliamentary system like the &quot;historical nationalities&quot;, or they could have not assumed any legislative powers and simply established mechanisms for the administration of the powers they were granted.

The constitution also explicitly established that the institutional framework for these communities would be a parliamentary system, with a Legislative Assembly elected by universal suffrage, a cabinet or &quot;council of government&quot;, a president of such a council, elected by the Assembly, and a High Court of Justice. They were also granted a maximum level of devolved powers.

While the constitution did not establish how many autonomous communities were to be created, on 31 July 1981, Leopoldo Calvo-Sotelo, then the prime minister of Spain and Felipe González, leader of the opposition in Parliament, signed the &quot;First Autonomic Pacts&quot; (&quot;Primeros pactos autonómicos&quot; in Spanish), in which they agreed to the creation of 17 autonomous communities and two autonomous cities, with the same institutions of government, but different competences. By 1983, all 17 autonomous communities were constituted: Andalusia, Aragon, Asturias, the Balearic Islands, the Basque Country, the Canary Islands, Cantabria, Castile and León, Castile–La Mancha, Catalonia, the Community of Madrid, Extremadura, Galicia, La Rioja, Navarra, the Region of Murcia and the Valencian Community. The two autonomous cities, Ceuta and Melilla were constituted in 1995.

Once the autonomous communities were created, Article 145 prohibits the &quot;federation of autonomous communities&quot;. This was understood as any agreement between communities that would produce an alteration to the political and territorial equilibrium that would cause a confrontation between different blocks of communities, an action incompatible with the principle of solidarity and the unity of the nation.

The so-called &quot;additional&quot; and &quot;transitory&quot; dispositions of the constitution allowed for some exceptions to the above-mentioned framework. In terms of territorial organization, the fifth transitory disposition established that the cities of Ceuta and Melilla, Spanish exclaves located on the northern coast of Africa, could be constituted as &quot;autonomous communities&quot; if the absolute majority of the members of their city councils would agree on such a motion, and with the approval of the Spanish Parliament, which would exercise its prerogatives to grant autonomy to other entities besides provinces.

However one aspect of this asymmetry in powers between regions is a cause of friction, namely that the Basque-speaking areas (Basque Country and Navarra) can raise their own taxes and negotiate a transfer to Madrid to pay for common services and hence, unlike the other regions, do not contribute to fiscal equalisation across Spain. These two regions or communities are known as &quot;chartered&quot; territories,
In all other communities, all taxes are levied and collected by or for the central government and then redistributed among all.

===Autonomic pacts===
The Statutes of Autonomy of the Basque Country and Catalonia were sanctioned by the Spanish Parliament on 18 December 1979. The position of the party in government, the Union of the Democratic Centre (UCD), was that only the three &quot;historical nationalities&quot; would assume full powers, while the rest would accede to autonomy via article 143, assuming fewer powers and perhaps not even establishing institutions of government. This was firmly opposed by the representatives of Andalusia, who demanded for their region the maximum level of powers granted to the &quot;nationalities&quot;.

After a massive rally in support of autonomy, a referendum was organized for Andalusia to attain autonomy through the strict requirements of article 151, or the &quot;fast route&quot;—with UCD calling for abstention, and the main party in opposition in Parliament, the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE) calling for a vote in favour. These requirements were not met, as in one of the eight provinces, Almería, votes in favour — although the plurality — did not amount to half of the electoral census as required. Yet, in general, the results of the referendum had been clear and unequivocal.

After several months of discussion, the then prime minister of Spain, Adolfo Suárez and the leader of the opposition, Felipe González, reached an agreement to resolve the Andalusian issue, whereby the Parliament approved an amendment to the law that regulated referendums, and used a prerogative of article 144c of the constitution, both actions which combined would allow Andalusia to take the fast route. They also agreed that no other region would take the &quot;fast route&quot;, but that all regions would establish a parliamentary system with all institutions of government. This opened a phase that was dubbed as , &quot;coffee for all&quot;. This agreement was eventually put into writing in July 1981 in what has been called the &quot;first autonomic pacts&quot;.

These &quot;autonomic pacts&quot; filled in the gap left by the open character of the constitution. Among other things:
* They described the final outline of the territorial division of Spain, with the specific number and name of the autonomous communities to be created.
* They restricted the &quot;fast-route&quot; to the &quot;historical nationalities&quot; and Andalusia; all the rest had to take the &quot;slow-route&quot;.
* They established that all autonomous communities would have institutions of government within a parliamentary system.
* They set up a deadline for all the remaining communities to be constituted: 1 February 1983.

In the end, 17 autonomous communities were created:
* Andalusia, and the three &quot;historical nationalities&quot;—the Basque Country, Catalonia and Galicia—took the &quot;fast-route&quot; and immediately assumed the maximum set of powers allowed in the constitution; the rest took the &quot;slow route&quot;.
* Aragon, Castilla-La Mancha, Castile and León, Extremadura and the Valencian Community acceded to autonomy as communities integrated by two or more provinces with common historical, economic and cultural characteristics.
* The Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands acceded to autonomy as insular territories, the latter integrated by two provinces.
* Principality of Asturias, Cantabria, La Rioja and Murcia acceded to autonomy as single provinces with historical identity (also called &quot;uniprovincial&quot; autonomous communities).
* Navarre, as a single province, acceded to autonomy through the recognition, update and improvement of its historical and local &quot;law&quot; (charters; Spanish &quot;fueros&quot;), and as such, it is known as a &quot;chartered community&quot;.
* The province of Madrid, home to the national capital, was removed from Castilla-La Mancha (formerly New Castile), to which it previously belonged, and constituted as a single-province autonomous community in the &quot;national interest&quot;, the &quot;Community of Madrid&quot;.

Special provisions were made for the Valencian Community and the Canary Islands in that, although they took the &quot;slow route&quot;, through the subsequent approval of specific organic laws, they were to assume full autonomy in less than 5 years, since they had started a process towards the &quot;fast route&quot; prior to the approval of the &quot;autonomic pacts&quot;.

On the other hand, Cantabria and La Rioja, although originally part of Old Castile—and both originally included in the &quot;pre-autonomic regime&quot; of Castile and León—were granted autonomy as single provinces with historical identity, a move supported by the majority of their populations. The &quot;autonomic pacts&quot; give both Cantabria and La Rioja the option of being incorporated into Castile and León in the future, and required that the Statutes of Autonomy of all three communities include such a provision. León, a historical kingdom and historical region of Spain, once joined to Old Castile to form Castile and León, was denied secession to be constituted as an autonomous community on its own right.

During the second half of the 1980s, the central government seemed reluctant to transfer all powers to the &quot;slow route&quot; communities. After the five years set up by the constitution, all &quot;slow route&quot; communities demanded the maximum transfer guaranteed by the constitution. This led to what has been called the &quot;second autonomic pacts&quot; of 1992, between the then prime minister of Spain Felipe González from PSOE and the leader of the opposition, José María Aznar from the newly created People&#x27;s Party (PP) successor of the People&#x27;s Alliance party. Through these agreements new powers were transferred, with the reforms to many Statutes of Autonomy of the &quot;slow-route&quot; communities with the aim of equalizing them to the &quot;fast route&quot; communities. In 1995, the cities of Ceuta and Melilla were constituted as &quot;autonomous cities&quot; without legislative powers, but with an autonomous assembly not subordinated to any other province or community.

The creation of the autonomous communities was a diverse process, that started with the constitution, was normalized with the autonomic pacts and was completed with the Statutes of Autonomy. It is, however, an ongoing process; further devolution—or even the return of transferred powers—is always a possibility. This has been evidenced in the 2000s, at the beginning with a wave of approval of new Statutes of Autonomy for many communities, and more recently with many considering the recentralization of some powers in the wake of the economic and financial crisis of 2008. Nonetheless, Spain is now a decentralized country with a structure unlike any other, similar but not equal to a federation, even though in many respects the country can be compared to countries which are undeniably federal. The unique resulting system is referred to as &quot;Autonomous state&quot;, or more precisely &quot;State of Autonomies&quot;.

===Current state of affairs===

With the implementation of the Autonomous Communities, Spain went from being one of the most centralized countries in the OECD to being one of the most decentralized; in particular, it has been the country where the incomes and outcomes of the decentralized bodies (the Autonomous Communities) has grown the most, leading this rank in Europe by 2015 and being fifth among OECD countries in tax devolution (after Canada, Switzerland, the United States and Austria). By means of the State of Autonomies implemented after the Spanish Constitution of 1978, Spain has been quoted to be &quot;remarkable for the extent of the powers peacefully devolved over the past 30 years&quot; and &quot;an extraordinarily decentralized country&quot;, with the central government accounting for just 18% of public spending, 38% by the regional governments, 13% by the local councils, and the remaining 31% by the social security system.

In terms of personnel, by 2010 almost 1,350,000 people or 50.3% of the total civil servants in Spain were employed by the autonomous communities; city and provincial councils accounted for 23.6% and those employees working for the central administration (police and military included) represented 22.2% of the total.

== Movement for further autonomy ==

Peripheral nationalism continues to play a key role in Spanish politics. Some peripheral nationalists view that there is a vanishing practical distinction between the terms &quot;nationalities&quot; and &quot;regions&quot;, as more powers are transferred to all communities in roughly the same degree and as other communities have chosen to identify themselves as &quot;nationalities&quot;. In fact, it has been argued that the establishment of the State of Autonomies &quot;has led to the creation of &quot;new regional identities&quot;, and &quot;invented communities&quot;.
Many in Galicia, the Basque Country, and Catalonia view their communities as &quot;nations&quot;, not just &quot;nationalities&quot;, and Spain as a &quot;plurinational state&quot; or a &quot;nation of nations&quot;, and they have made demands for further devolution or secession.

=== Basque Country ===

In 2004 the Basque Parliament approved the Ibarretxe Plan, whereby the Basque Country would approve a new Statute of Autonomy containing key provisions such as shared sovereignty with Spain, full independence of the judiciary, and the right to self-determination, and assuming all powers except that of the Spanish nationality law, defense, and monetary policy. The plan was rejected by the Spanish Parliament in 2005 and the situation has remained largely stable in that front so far.

=== Catalonia ===

A particularly contentious point – especially in Catalonia – has been the one of fiscal tensions, with Catalan nationalists intensifying their demand for further financing during the 2010s. In this regard, the new rules for fiscal decentralisation in force since 2011 already make Spain one of the most decentralized countries in the world also in budgetary and fiscal matters, with the base for income tax split at 50/50 between the Spanish government and the regions (something unheard of in much bigger federal states such as Germany or the United States, which retain the income tax as an exclusively or primarily federal one). Besides, each region can also decide to set its own income tax bands and its own additional rates, higher or lower than the federal rates, with the corresponding income accruing to the region which no longer has to share it with other regions. This current level of fiscal decentralisation has been regarded by economists such as Thomas Piketty as troublesome since, in his view, &quot;challenges the very idea of solidarity within the country and comes down to playing the regions against each other, which is particularly problematic when the issue is one of income tax as this is supposed to enable the reduction of inequalities between the richest and the poorest, over and above regional or professional identities&quot;.

==== Catalan independence ====
The severe economic crisis in Spain that started in 2008 produced different reactions in the different communities. On one hand, some began to consider a return of some responsibilities to the central government while, on the other hand, in Catalonia debate on the fiscal deficit—&quot;Catalonia being one of the largest net contributors in taxes&quot;—led many to support secession. In September 2012, Artur Mas, then Catalonia&#x27;s president, requested from the central government a new &quot;fiscal agreement&quot;, with the possibility of giving his community powers of fiscal autonomy equal to those of the chartered communities, but prime minister Mariano Rajoy refused. Mas dissolved the Catalan Parliament, called for new elections, and promised to conduct a referendum on independence within the next four years.

Rajoy&#x27;s government declared that they would use all &quot;legal instruments&quot;—current legislation requires the central executive government or the Congress of Deputies to call for or sanction a binding referendum— to block any such attempt. The Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party and its counterpart in Catalonia proposed to reopen the debate on the territorial organization of Spain, changing the constitution to create a true federal system to &quot;better reflect the singularities&quot; of Catalonia, as well as to modify the current taxation system.

On Friday 27 October 2017 the Catalan Parliament voted on the independence of Catalonia; the result was 70 in favor, 10 against, 2 neither, with 53 representatives not present in protest. In the following days, the members of the Catalan government either fled or were imprisoned.

One scholar summarises the current situation as follows:

the autonomous state appears to have come full circle, with reproaches from all sides. According to some, it has not gone far enough and has failed to satisfy their aspirations for improved self-government. For others it has gone too far, fostering inefficiency or reprehensible linguistic policies.
=== Possible rearrangements ===
Besides the territorial disputes that Spain holds with the United Kingdom, Morocco and Portugal, some forces have campaigned for the redistribution of territories among communities:
* There are independence movements pleading for secession from Spain in Catalonia, the Basque Country and Navarre, Galicia and the Canary Islands.
* The Basque Statute of Autonomy and the provide a pathway for the integration of Navarre in the Basque autonomous community. The Parliament of Navarre has not entertained the possibility.
* The Treviño enclave (formed by the municipalities of Condado de Treviño and La Puebla de Arganzón) is part of the province of Burgos (in the autonomous community of Castile and León) but is surrounded by Álava (Basque autonomous community). There is a dispute in which the Castilian-Leonese government support the status quo and the Basque Government and much of the local population support integration in Álava and the Basque Country.
* Similarly, Valle de Villaverde is part of the autonomous community of Cantabria but surrounded by Biscay, in the Basque autonomous community. Lately local support for integration in the Basque Country has diminished.
* Leonesism pleads for the establishment of the autonomous community of León separating the provinces of León, Zamora and Salamanca (or in a restricted sense, just the province of León) from the rest of the provinces of the autonomous community of Castile and León, pursuant to the configuration of the former Region of León.
* The Ayuntamiento of La Línea de la Concepción has asked for permission to call a referendum on the secession of the municipality from the province of Cádiz in the autonomous community of Andalusia to become a standalone autonomous community, citing the special case of bordering Gibraltar.

==Constitutional and statutory framework==
The State of Autonomies, as established in Article 2 of the constitution, has been argued to be based on four principles: willingness to accede to autonomy, unity in diversity, autonomy but not sovereignty of the communities, and solidarity among them all. The structure of the autonomous communities is determined both by the devolution allowed by the constitution and the powers assumed in their respective Statutes of Autonomy. While the autonomic agreements and other laws have allowed for an &quot;equalization&quot; of all communities, differences still remain.

===The Statute of Autonomy===
The Statute of Autonomy is the basic institutional law of the autonomous community or city, recognized by the Spanish constitution in article 147. It is approved by a parliamentary assembly representing the community, and then approved by the , the Spanish Parliament, through an &quot;Organic Law&quot;, requiring the favourable vote of the absolute majority of the Congress of Deputies.

For communities that acceded to autonomy through the &quot;fast route&quot;, a referendum is required before it can be sanctioned by the Parliament. The Statutes of Autonomy must contain, at least, the name of the community, its territorial limits, the names, organization and seat of the institutions of government, the powers they assume and the principles for their bilingual policy, if applicable.

The constitution establishes that all powers not explicitly assumed by the State (the central government) in the constitution, can be assumed by the autonomous community in their Statutes of Autonomy; but also, all powers not explicitly assumed by the autonomous community in their Statutes of Autonomy are automatically assumed by the State. In case of conflict, the constitution prevails. In case of disagreement, any administration can bring the case before the Constitutional Court of Spain.

===Institutional organization===
All autonomous communities have a parliamentary system based on a division of powers comprising:
* A Legislative Assembly, whose members are elected by universal suffrage according to a system of proportional representation, in which all areas that integrate the territory are fairly represented
* A Council of Government, with executive and administrative powers, headed by a prime minister, whose official title is &quot;president&quot;, elected by the Legislative Assembly—usually the leader of the party or coalition with a majority in the Assembly—and nominated by the King of Spain
* A High Court of Justice, hierarchically under the Supreme Court of Spain
The majority of the communities have approved regional electoral laws within the limits set up by the laws for the entire country. Despite minor differences, all communities use proportional representation following the D&#x27;Hondt method; all members of regional parliaments are elected for four-year terms, but the president of the community has the faculty to dissolve the legislature and call for early elections. Nonetheless, in all communities except for the Basque Country, Catalonia, Galicia, and Andalusia, elections are held the last Sunday of May every four years, concurrent with municipal elections in all of Spain.

The names of the Council of Government and the Legislative Assembly vary between communities. In some autonomous communities, these institutions are restored historical bodies of government or representation of the previous kingdoms or regional entities within the Spanish Crown—like the Generalitat of Catalonia—while others are entirely new creations.

In some, both the executive and the legislature, though constituting two separate institutions, are collectively identified with a single specific name. A specific denomination may not refer to the same branch of government in all communities; for example, &quot;junta&quot; may refer to the executive office in some communities, to the legislature in others, or to the collective name of all branches of government in others.

Given the ambiguity in the constitution that did not specify which territories were nationalities and which were regions, other territories, besides the implicit three &quot;historical nationalities&quot;, have also chosen to identify themselves as nationalities, in accordance with their historical regional identity, such as Andalusia, Aragon, the Balearic Islands, the Canary Islands, and the Valencian Community.

The two autonomous cities have more limited powers than autonomous communities, but less limited than other municipalities. The executive is exercised by a president, who is also the mayor of the city. In the same way, limited legislative power is vested in a local assembly in which the deputies are also the city councillors.

===Legal powers===
The autonomic agreements of 1982 and 1992 tried to equalize powers () devolved to the 17 autonomous communities, within the limits of the constitution and the differences guaranteed by it. This has led to an &quot;asymmetrical homogeneity&quot;. In the words of the Constitutional Court of Spain in its ruling of 5 August 1983, the autonomous communities are characterized by their &quot;homogeneity and diversity...equal in their subordination to the constitutional order, in the principles of their representation in the Senate, in their legitimation before the Constitutional Court, and in that the differences between the distinct Statutes [of Autonomy] cannot imply economic or social privileges; however, they can be unequal with respect to the process to accede to autonomy and the concrete determination of the autonomic content of their Statute, and therefore, in their scope of powers. The autonomic regime is characterized by an equilibrium between homogeneity and diversity ... Without the former there will be no unity or integration in the state&#x27;s ensemble; without the latter, there would not be [a] true plurality and the capacity of self-government&quot;.
The asymmetrical devolution is a unique characteristic of the territorial structure of Spain, in that the autonomous communities have a different range of devolved powers. These were based on what has been called in Spanish as &quot;hechos diferenciales&quot;, &quot;differential facts&quot; or &quot;differential traits&quot;.

This expression refers to the idea that some communities have particular traits, with respect to Spain as a whole. In practice these traits are a native &quot;language proper to their own territories&quot; separate from Spanish, a particular financial regime or special civil rights expressed in a code, which generate a distinct political personality. These &quot;hechos diferenciales&quot; of their distinct political and historical personality are constitutionally and statutorily (i. e., in their Statutes of Autonomy) recognized in the exceptions granted to some of them and the additional powers they assume.

The powers to be exercised can be divided into three groups: exclusive to the State or central government, shared powers, and devolved powers exclusive to the communities. Article 149 states which powers are exclusive to the central government: international relations, defense, administration of justice, commercial, criminal, civil, and labour legislation, customs, general finances and state debt, public health, basic legislation, and general coordination. All autonomous communities have the power to manage their own finances in the way they see fit, and are responsible for the administration of education—school and universities—health and social services and cultural and urban development. Yet there are differences as stipulated in their Statutes and the constitution:
* Aragon, the Balearic Islands, the Basque Country, Catalonia, Galicia and the Valencian Community have a regional civil code
* Basque Country, Catalonia, and Navarre have their own police corps—the , the Mossos d&#x27;Esquadra and the Nafarroako Foruzaingoa, respectively; other communities have them too, but not fully developed (adscribed to the Spanish National Police) 
* The Canary Islands have a special financial regime in virtue of its location as an overseas territories, while the Basque Country and Navarre have a distinct financial regime called &quot;chartered regime&quot;
* The Balearic Islands, the Basque Country, Catalonia, Galicia, Navarre, and the Valencian Community have a co-official language and therefore a distinct linguistic regime

===Degree of financial autonomy===
How the communities are financed has been one of the most contentious aspects in their relationship with the central government. The constitution gave all communities significant control over spending, but the central government retained effective control of their revenue supply. That is, the central government is still charge of levying and collecting most taxes, which it then redistributes to the autonomous communities with the aim of producing &quot;fiscal equalization&quot;. This applies to all communities, with the exception of the Basque Country and Navarre.

This financial scheme is known as the &quot;common regime&quot;. In essence, fiscal equalization implies that richer communities become net contributors to the system, while poorer communities become net recipients. The two largest net contributors to the system are the Balearic Islands and the Community of Madrid, in percentage terms, or the Community of Madrid and Catalonia in absolute terms.

Central government funding is the main source of revenue for the communities of &quot;common regime&quot;. Redistribution, or transfer payments, are given to the communities of common regime to manage the responsibilities they have assumed. The amount they receive is based upon several calculations which include a consideration for population, land area, administrative units, dispersal of population, relative poverty, fiscal pressure and insularity. The central government is committed to returning a specific percentage of taxes to all communities with common regime, within the differences allowed for fiscal equalization. The communities of common regime have the ability to add a surcharge to the so-called &quot;ceded taxes&quot;—taxes set at the central level, but collected locally—and they can lower or raise personal income taxes up to a limit.

The Basque Country and Navarre were granted an exception in the fiscal and financial system through the first additional disposition of the constitution that recognizes their historical &quot;charters&quot; —hence they are known as &quot;communities of chartered regime&quot; or &quot;foral regime&quot;. Through their &quot;chartered regime&quot;, these communities are allowed to levy and collect all so-called &quot;contracted taxes&quot;, including income tax and corporate tax, and they have much more flexibility to lower or raise them. This &quot;chartered&quot; or &quot;foral&quot; contract entails true financial autonomy.

Since they collect almost all taxes, they send to the central government a pre-arranged amount known as &quot;cupo&quot;, &quot;quota&quot; or &quot;aportación&quot;, &quot;contribution&quot;, and the treaty whereby this system is recognized is known as &quot;concierto&quot;, &quot;treaty&quot;, or &quot;convenio&quot;, &quot;pact&quot;. Hence they are also said to have &quot;concierto económico&quot;, an &quot;economic treaty&quot;. Since they collect all taxes themselves and only send a prearranged amount to the central government for the powers exclusive to the State, they do not participate in &quot;fiscal equalization&quot;, in that they do not receive any money back.

===Spending===
As more responsibilities have been assumed by the autonomous communities in areas such as social welfare, health, and education, public expenditure patterns have seen a shift from the central government towards the communities since the 1980s. In the late 2000s, autonomous communities accounted for 35% of all public expenditure in Spain, a percentage that is even higher than that of states within a federation. With no legal constraints to balance budgets, and since the central government retains control over fiscal revenue in the communities of common regime, these are in a way encouraged to build up debt.

The Council on Fiscal and Financial Policy, which includes representatives of the central government and of the autonomous communities, has become one of the most efficient institutions of coordination in matters of public expenditures and revenue. Through the Council several agreements of financing have been agreed, as well as limits to the communities&#x27; public debt. The Organic Law of the Financing of Autonomous Communities of 1988 requires that the communities obtain the authorization of the central Ministry of Finance to issue public debt.

===Linguistic regimes===

The preamble to the constitution explicitly stated that it is the nation&#x27;s will to protect &quot;all Spaniards and the peoples of Spain in the exercise of human rights, their cultures and traditions, languages and institutions&quot;. This is a significant recognition not only in that it differed drastically from the restrictive linguistic policies during the Franco era, but also because part of the distinctiveness of the &quot;historical nationalities&quot; lies on their own regional languages. The nation is thus openly multilingual, in which Castilian—that is, Spanish—is the official language in all territories, but the &quot;other Spanish languages&quot; can also be official in their respective communities, in accordance with their Statutes of Autonomy.

Article 3 of the constitution ends up declaring that the &quot;richness of the distinct linguistic modalities of Spain represents a patrimony which will be the object of special respect and protection&quot;. Spanish remains the only official language of the State; other languages are only co-official with Spanish in the communities that have so regulated. In addition, knowledge of the Spanish language was declared a right and an obligation of all Spaniards.

Spanish legislation, most notably in the Statutes of Autonomy of the bilingual communities, use the term &quot;own language&quot;, or &quot;language proper to a community&quot;, to refer to a language other than Spanish that originated or had historical roots in that particular territory. The Statutes of Autonomy of the respective autonomous communities have declared Basque the language proper to the Basque Country and Navarre, Catalan the language proper to Catalonia, the Balearic Islands and the Valencian Community—where it is historically, traditionally and officially known as Valencian—and Galician to be the language proper to Galicia. There are other protected regional languages in other autonomous communities. As a percentage of total population in Spain, Basque is spoken by 2%, Catalan/Valencian by 17%, and Galician by 7% of all Spaniards. A 2016 Basque Government census revealed 700,000 fluent speakers in Spain (51,000 in Basque counties in France) and 1,185.000 total when passive speakers are included.

===Subdivisions===

===Powers exercised by the autonomous governments===
The powers of the autonomous communities are not homogeneous. Broadly the powers are divided into &quot;Exclusive&quot;, &quot;Shared&quot;, and &quot;Executive&quot; (&quot;partial&quot;). In some cases, the autonomous community may have exclusive responsibility for the administration of a policy area but may only have executive (i. e., carries out) powers as far as the policy itself is concerned, meaning it must enforce policy and laws decided at the national level.

<text>Andalucia is the fourth studio album by Los Angeles rock band Tito &amp; Tarantula, released in 2002. The album marked several line-up changes in the band, which had previously consisted of lead singer/rhythm guitarist Tito Larriva, lead guitarist Peter Atanasoff, and drummer Johnny &quot;Vatos&quot; Hernandez. This album featured the debut of lead guitarist Steven Hufsteter – who had previously played with Larriva in the Cruzados, bassist Io Perry, and keyboardist Marcus Praed.

The band toured promoting the album for several years. They also filmed a music video for the song &quot;California Girl&quot;. However, upon seeing how bad the footage of the video was, Perry threw up, Larriva threatened to quit, and Atanasoff was not seen around for days. So, to compensate, Larriva made his own video for the song using the eight dollars he had in his pocket. In the last 40 seconds of the song &quot;Effortless&quot;, Larriva, Atanasoff, and Perry can be heard laughing while they watch the &quot;California Girl&quot; music video.

The song &quot;La Flor De Mal&quot; is a cover of a Cruzados song that Larriva and Hufsteter wrote when they were in the Cruzados.

<text>The Battle of Tsushima (, &quot;Tsusimskoye srazheniye&quot;), also known in Japan as the , was the final naval battle of the Russo-Japanese War, fought on 27–28 May 1905 in the Tsushima Strait. A devastating defeat for the Imperial Russian Navy, the battle was the only decisive engagement ever fought between modern steel battleship fleets and the first in which wireless telegraphy (radio) played a critically important role. The battle was described by contemporary Sir George Clarke as &quot;by far the greatest and the most important naval event since Trafalgar&quot;.

The battle involved the Japanese Combined Fleet under Admiral Tōgō Heihachirō and the Russian Second Pacific Squadron under Admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky, which had sailed over seven months and from the Baltic Sea. The Russians hoped to reach Vladivostok and establish naval control of the Far East in order to relieve the Imperial Russian Army in Manchuria. The Russian fleet had a large advantage in the number of battleships, but was overall older and slower than the Japanese fleet, and outnumbered nearly three to one in total hulls. The Russians were sighted in the early morning on 27 May, and the battle began in the afternoon. Rozhestvensky was wounded and knocked unconscious in the initial action, and four of his battleships were sunk by sunset. At night, Japanese destroyers and torpedo boats attacked the remaining ships, and Admiral Nikolai Nebogatov surrendered in the morning of 28 May.

All 11 Russian battleships were lost, out of which seven were sunk and four captured. Only a few warships escaped, with one cruiser and two destroyers reaching Vladivostok, and two auxiliary cruisers as well as one transport escaping back to Madagascar. Three cruisers were interned at Manila by the United States until the war was over. Eight auxiliaries and one destroyer were disarmed and remanded at Shanghai by China. Russian casualties were high, with more than 5,000 dead and 6,000 captured. The Japanese, which had lost no heavy ships, had 117 dead.

The loss of almost every heavy warship of the Baltic Fleet forced Russia to sue for peace, and the Treaty of Portsmouth was signed in September 1905. In Japan, the battle was hailed as one of the greatest naval victories in Japanese history, and Admiral Tōgō was revered as a national hero. His flagship has been preserved as a museum ship in Yokosuka Harbour.

==Background==

===Conflict in the Far East===

On 8 February 1904, destroyers of the Imperial Japanese Navy launched a surprise attack on the Russian Far East Fleet anchored in Port Arthur; three ships – two battleships and a cruiser – were damaged in the attack. The Russo-Japanese war had thus begun. Japan&#x27;s first objective was to secure its lines of communication and supply to the Asian mainland, enabling it to conduct a ground war in Manchuria. To achieve this, it was necessary to neutralize Russian naval power in the Far East. At first, the Russian naval forces remained inactive and did not engage the Japanese, who staged unopposed landings in Korea. The Russians were revitalised by the arrival of Admiral Stepan Makarov and were able to achieve some degree of success against the Japanese, but on 13 April Makarov&#x27;s flagship, the battleship , struck a mine and sank; Makarov was among the dead. His successors failed to challenge the Japanese Navy, and the remaining six Russian battleships and five armoured cruisers were effectively bottled up in their base at Port Arthur.

By May, the Japanese had landed forces on the Liaodong Peninsula and in August began the siege of the naval station. On 9 August, Admiral Wilgelm Vitgeft, commander of the 1st Pacific Squadron, was ordered to sortie his fleet to Vladivostok, link up with the Squadron stationed there, and then engage the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) in a decisive battle. Both squadrons of the Russian Pacific Fleet would ultimately become dispersed during the Battle of the Yellow Sea, where Admiral Vitgeft was killed by a salvo strike from the on 10 August, and the Battle off Ulsan on 14 August 1904. What remained of Russian Pacific naval power would eventually be sunk in Port Arthur in December 1904.

===Departure===
With the inactivity of the First Pacific Squadron after the death of Admiral Makarov and the tightening of the Japanese noose around Port Arthur, the Russians considered sending part of their Baltic Fleet to the Far East. The plan was to relieve Port Arthur by sea, link up with the First Pacific Squadron, overwhelm the Imperial Japanese Navy, and then delay the Japanese advance into Manchuria until Russian reinforcements could arrive via the Trans-Siberian railroad and overwhelm the Japanese land forces there. As the situation in the Far East deteriorated, the Tsar (encouraged by his cousin Kaiser Wilhelm II), agreed to the formation of the &quot;Second Pacific Squadron&quot;. This would consist of five divisions of the Baltic Fleet, including 11 of its 13 battleships. The squadrons, including the later-formed &quot;Third Pacific Squadron&quot;, departed the Baltic ports of Reval (Tallinn) and Libau (Liepāja) on 15–16 October 1904 (Rozhestvensky fleet) and 2 February 1905 (Nebogatov fleet), and on 3 November 1904 (armoured cruisers and , auxiliary cruisers and &quot;Terek&quot;, destroyers &quot;Gromkiy&quot; and &quot;Grozniy&quot; under the command of Captain 1st rank Leonid Dobrotvorsky.), numbering 48 ships and auxiliaries.

===Dogger Bank===
The Rozhestvensky and von Fölkersahm squadrons sailed through Øresund strait into the North Sea. The Russians had received numerous fictitious reports of Japanese torpedo boats operating in the area and were on high alert. In the Dogger Bank incident, the Rozhestvensky squadron mistook a group of British fishing trawlers operating near the Dogger Bank at night for hostile Japanese ships. The fleet fired upon the small civilian vessels, killing several British fishermen; one trawler was sunk while another six were damaged. In confusion, the Russians even fired upon two of their own vessels, killing some of their own men. The firing continued for twenty minutes before Rozhestvensky ordered firing to cease; loss of life was limited by the fact that the Russian gunnery was highly inaccurate. The British were outraged by the incident and incredulous that the Russians could mistake a group of fishing trawlers for Japanese warships, thousands of kilometres from the nearest Japanese port. Britain almost entered the war in support of Japan, with whom it had an alliance (but was neutral in the war, as their mutual defense clause stipulated &quot;when either nation faced &#x27;more than one&#x27; adversaries in a war&quot;). The Royal Navy sortied and shadowed the Russian fleet until a diplomatic agreement was reached. France, which had hoped to eventually bring the British and Russians together in an anti-German bloc, intervened diplomatically to restrain Britain from declaring war. The Russians were forced to accept responsibility for the incident, compensate the fishermen, and disembark officers who were suspected of misconduct to give evidence to the enquiry.

===Routes===

The draught of the newer battleships, which had proven to be considerably greater than designed, preventing their passage through the Suez Canal caused the fleet to separate after leaving Tangier on 3 November 1904. The newer battleships, cruisers, fast auxiliaries and the destroyers for protection, proceeded around the Cape of Good Hope under the command of Admiral Rozhestvensky while the older battleships and cruisers made their way through the Suez Canal under the command of Admiral von Fölkersahm. They planned to rendezvous in Madagascar, and both sections of the fleet successfully completed this part of the voyage. The longer journey around Africa took a toll on the Russian crews under Rozhestvensky, &quot;who had never experienced such a different climate or such a long time at sea&quot; as &quot;conditions on the ships deteriorated, and disease and respiratory issues killed a number of sailors&quot;. The voyage took half a year in rough seas, with difficulty obtaining coal for refueling – as the warships could not legally enter the ports of neutral nations – and the morale of the crews plummeted. The Russians needed of coal and 30 to 40 re-coaling sessions to reach French Indochina (now Vietnam), and coal was provided by 60 colliers from the Hamburg-Amerika Line. By April and May 1905 the reunited fleet had anchored at Cam Ranh Bay in French Indochina.

The Russians had been ordered to break the blockade of Port Arthur, but the battleships in the port were sunk by the Japanese land artillery, and the heavily fortified city/port had already fallen on 2 January just after the Second Pacific Squadron arrived at Nossi Be, Madagascar, before the arrival of the Fölkersahm detachment. The objective was therefore shifted to linking up with the remaining Russian ships stationed in the port of Vladivostok, before bringing the Japanese fleet to battle.

==Prelude==
The Russians had three possible routes to enter the Sea of Japan and reach Vladivostok: the longer were the La Pérouse Strait and Tsugaru Strait, on either side of Hokkaido. Admiral Rozhestvensky did not reveal his choice even to his subordinates until 25 May, when it became apparent he chose Tsushima by ordering the fleet to head northeast after detaching transports &quot;Yaroslavl&quot;, &quot;Vladimir&quot;, &quot;Kuronia&quot;, &quot;Voronezh&quot;, &quot;Livonia&quot; and &quot;Meteor&quot; as well as auxiliary cruisers &quot;Rion&quot; and &quot;Dniepr&quot; with the instruction to go to the near-by neutral port of Shanghai. The Tsushima Strait is the body of water eastward of the Tsushima Island group, located midway between the Japanese island of Kyushu and the Korean Peninsula, the shortest and most direct route from Indochina. The other routes would have required the fleet to sail east around Japan. The Japanese Combined Fleet and the Russian Second and Third Pacific Squadrons, sent from the Baltic Sea now numbering 38, would fight in the straits between Korea and Japan near the Tsushima Islands.

Because of the journey, the Russian fleet was in a poor condition for battle. Apart from the four newest s, Admiral Nebogatov&#x27;s 3rd Pacific Fleet consisted of older and poorly maintained warships. Overall, the Japanese side had a maneuvrability advantage. The long voyage, combined with a lack of opportunity for maintenance, meant the Russian ships were heavily fouled, significantly reducing their speed. The Japanese 1st Battle Division could exceed and regularly maneuvred at 15 knots, but the Russian fleet included warships with the maximum speed of 14 to 15 knots (with new engines/boilers, normal load, and clean hull) and the auxiliaries of 10–12 knots, that limited the fleet speed to 9 knots.

Tōgō&#x27;s greatest advantage was that of experience, having five of the ten fleet commanders in the history of the Russian and Japanese navy with combat experience aboard modern warships on his side, while Rozhestvensky had none. The other five were all Russian admirals whom Tōgō had defeated and not present for this battle, including Oskar Starck, who had been relieved of his command following his humiliating defeat in the Battle of Port Arthur; Admiral Stepan Makarov, killed by a mine off Port Arthur; Wilgelm Vitgeft, who had been killed in the Battle of the Yellow Sea; and Admiral (Prince) Pavel Ukhtomsky who was relieved and recalled to Mukden by Viceroy Yevgeni Alekseyev after six battleships of the Pacific Squadron failed to reach Vladivostok as a result of the Battle of the Yellow Sea. Admiral Karl Jessen, who experienced the Battle off Ulsan, remained in Vladivostok.

Additionally, there were significant deficiencies in the Russian naval fleet&#x27;s equipment and training. Russian naval tests with their torpedoes exposed major technological failings.
==Battle==

===First contact===
Because the Russians wanted to slip undetected into Vladivostok, they approached Japanese waters in radio silence. They steered outside regular shipping channels to reduce the chance of detection. On the night of 26 May 1905 the Russian fleet approached the Tsushima Strait.

In the night, thick fog blanketed the straits, giving the Russians an advantage. At 02:45 on 27 May Japan Standard Time (JST), the Japanese auxiliary cruiser observed three lights on what appeared to be a vessel on the distant horizon and closed to investigate. These lights were from the Russian hospital ship &quot;Orel&quot;, which, in compliance with the rules of war, had continued to burn them. At 04:30, &quot;Shinano Maru&quot; approached the vessel, noting that she carried no guns and appeared to be an auxiliary. The &quot;Orel&quot; mistook the &quot;Shinano Maru&quot; for another Russian vessel and did not attempt to notify the fleet. Instead, she signaled to &quot;Shinano Maru&quot; in Russian code, which made no sense to the Japanese ship. The &quot;Shinano Maru&quot; then sighted the shapes of ten other Russian ships in the mist.

Wireless telegraphy played an important role from the start. At 04:55, Captain Narikawa of the &quot;Shinano Maru&quot; sent a message to the Combined Fleet command onboard &quot;Mikasa&quot; in Masampo that the &quot;Enemy is in grid 203&quot;. By 05:00, intercepted radio signals informed the Russians that they had been discovered and that Japanese scouting cruisers were shadowing them. Admiral Tōgō received the message at 05:05, and immediately began to prepare his battle fleet for a sortie.

===Beginning of the battle===
At 06:34, before departing with the Combined Fleet, Admiral Tōgō wired a confident message to the navy minister in Tokyo:

The final sentence of this telegram has become famous in Japanese military history, and has been quoted by former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe.

The entire Japanese fleet was put to sea, with Tōgō in his flagship &quot;Mikasa&quot; leading over 40 vessels to meet the Russians. Meanwhile, the shadowing Japanese scouting vessels sent wireless reports every few minutes as to the formation and course of the Russian fleet. There was mist which reduced visibility and the weather was poor. Wireless gave the Japanese an advantage; in his report on the battle, Admiral Tōgō noted the following:

At 13:40, both fleets sighted each other, ready to engage. At around 13:55, Tōgō ordered the hoisting of the Z flag, issuing a predetermined announcement to the entire fleet:

By 14:45, Tōgō had &quot;crossed the Russian T&quot;, enabling him to fire broadsides, while the Russians could reply only with their forward turrets.

===Daylight action===

The Russians sailed from south-southwest to north-northeast; &quot;continuing to a point of intersection which allowed only their bow guns to bear; enabling him [Tōgō] to throw most of the Russian batteries successively out of bearing.&quot; The Japanese fleet steamed from northeast to southwest, then Tōgō ordered the fleet to turn 180-degrees in sequence, which enabled his ships to take the same course as the Russians. Although Tōgō&#x27;s U-turn was successful, Russian gunnery had proven surprisingly good and the flagship &quot;Mikasa&quot; was hit 15 times in five minutes. Before the end of the engagement, she was struck 15 more times by large calibre shells. Rozhestvensky had only two alternatives, &quot;a charge direct, in line abreast&quot;, or to commence &quot;a formal pitched battle.&quot; He chose the latter, and at 14:08, the Japanese flagship &quot;Mikasa&quot; was hit at about 7,000 metres, with the Japanese replying at 6,400 meters. Superior Japanese gunnery then took its toll, with most of the Russian battleships being crippled.

Captain 2nd Rank Vladimir Semenoff, a Russian staff officer aboard the flagship , said &quot;It seemed impossible even to count the number of projectiles striking us. Shells seemed to be pouring upon us incessantly one after another. The steel plates and superstructure on the upper decks were torn to pieces, and the splinters caused many casualties. Iron ladders were crumpled up into rings, guns were literally hurled from their mountings. In addition to this, there was the unusually high temperature and liquid flame of the explosion, which seemed to spread over everything. I actually watched a steel plate catch fire from a burst.&quot;

Ninety minutes into the battle, the first warship to be sunk was the from Rozhestvensky&#x27;s 2nd Battleship division. This was the first time a modern armoured warship had been sunk by gunfire alone.

A direct hit on the &#x27;s magazines by the Japanese battleship &quot;Fuji&quot; caused her to explode, which sent smoke thousands of metres into the air and trapped all but one of her crew onboard as she sank. Rozhestvensky was knocked out of action by a shell fragment that struck his skull. In the evening, Rear Admiral Nikolai Nebogatov took over command of the Russian fleet. The Russians lost the battleships &quot;Knyaz Suvorov&quot;, &quot;Oslyabya&quot;, and &quot;Borodino&quot;. The Japanese ships suffered only light damage.

===Night attacks===
At night, around 20:00, 21 destroyers and 45 Japanese torpedo boats were thrown against the Russians. They were deployed initially from the north, east and west while being slightly visible, forcing the Russians, roughly in the order of cruisers, battleships and auxiliaries groups, to turn west. The Japanese were aggressive, continuing their attacks for three hours without a break; as a result, during the night there were a number of collisions between the small craft and Russian warships. The Russians were dispersed in small groups. By 23:00, it appeared that the Russians had vanished, but they revealed their positions to their pursuers by switching on their searchlights – ironically, the searchlights had been turned on to spot the attackers. The old battleship struck chained floating mines laid in front and was forced to stop in order not to push the chain forward, inviting other floating mines on the chain in on herself. She was consequently torpedoed four times and sunk. Out of a crew of 622, only three survived, one to be rescued by the Japanese and the other two by a British merchant ship.

The battleship was badly damaged by a torpedo in the stern and was scuttled the next day. Two old armoured cruisers – and – were badly damaged, the former by a torpedo hit to the bow, the latter by colliding with a Japanese destroyer. They were both scuttled by their crews the next morning off Tsushima Island, where they headed while taking on water. The night attacks placed a great strain on the Russians, as they lost two battleships and two armoured cruisers, while the Japanese lost only three torpedo boats.

===&quot;XGE&quot; signal and Russian surrender===
At 05:23 on 28 May, what remained of the Russian fleet was sighted heading northeast. Tōgō&#x27;s battleships proceeded to surround Nebogatov&#x27;s remaining squadron south of the island of Takeshima and commenced main battery fire at 12,000 meters. The then turned southeast and started to flee. Realising that his guns were outranged by at least one thousand metres, and the Japanese battleships had proven on the day before to be faster than his own so that he could not close the distance if he tried, Nebogatov ordered the four battleships remaining under his command to surrender. &quot;XGE&quot;, an international signal of surrender, was hoisted; however, the Japanese navy continued to fire as they did not have &quot;surrender&quot; in their code books and had to hastily find one that did. Still under heavy fire, Nebogatov then ordered a white tablecloth sent up the masthead, but Tōgō, having faced the difficult decision to sink a British transport ship full of Chinese soldiers during the First Sino-Japanese War as the commander of IJN cruiser , knew the signal meant a request for a truce or parley, not &#x27;surrender&#x27; in the legal definition, and that either meaning contradicted not stopping the ships.

His lieutenants found the codebook that included XGE signal and reported that stopping engines is a requirement for the signal and all the Russian ships were still moving, so he continued firing while the response flag signal &quot;STOP&quot; hoisted. Nebogatov then ordered St. Andrew&#x27;s Cross lowered and the Japanese national flag raised on the gaff and all engines stopped. Seeing the requirement for the signal met, Tōgō gave the cease-fire and accepted Nebogatov&#x27;s surrender. Nebogatov surrendered knowing that he could be shot for doing so. He said to his men:

As an example of the level of damage inflicted on a Russian battleship, was hit by five 12-inch, nine 8-inch, 39 six-inch and 21 smaller or unidentified shells. This damage caused her to list, and the engine ceased to operate when she was being taken by the Japanese navy to First Battle Division home port of Sasebo in Nagasaki after Tōgō accepted the surrender. Cruiser and then battleship had to tow &quot;Oryol&quot;, and their destination was changed to the closer Maizuru Naval Arsenal to avoid losing the prize of war. Her commander Captain Yung, who was seriously injured on 27 May, died in the night of the 29th onboard battleship &quot;Asahi&quot; en route.

===Capture of Rozhestvensky===
Russian destroyer &quot;Buyniy&quot;, after rescuing the squadron command including Admiral Rozhestvensky from the burning at 17:30 during the day battle on the 27th, found cruiser &quot;Donskoi&quot;, destroyers &quot;Byedoviy&quot; and &quot;Grozniy&quot; in convoy on the morning of 28 May. Rozhestvensky chose &quot;Byedoviy&quot; to move the fleet command officers and himself as &quot;Buyniy&quot; had serious damages and &quot;Donskoi&quot;, being an old ship, was very slow. (Later in the afternoon, &quot;Buyniy&quot; was sunk by gunfire from &quot;Donskoi&quot; after taking the crew aboard.) Leaving the struggling &quot;Buyniy&quot; and the slow &quot;Donskoi&quot; behind, &quot;Byedoviy&quot; and &quot;Grozniy&quot; headed for Vladivostok.

Japanese destroyers and had mechanical issues during the night battle on the 27th and had to fix the problems at the Port of Ulsan. Both destroyers finished their temporary repair work by the morning of the 28th and left the port together. They spotted the two Russian destroyers on the way to join the rest of the Combined Fleet and engaged at 15:25.

Destroyer &quot;Grozniy&quot; increased speed being chased by &quot;Kagerō&quot;, but &quot;Byedoviy&quot; slowed down and stopped in the face of firing and approaching &quot;Sazanami&quot; while raising a white flag. &quot;Grozniy&quot; was able to keep sufficient distance from &quot;Kagerō&quot;, exchanging just a few long-distance shots at about 18:30, before nightfall. She became one of the three warships reaching Vladivostok after surviving the battle.

The Combined Fleet command could not believe the news when cruiser , which rendezvoused &quot;Sazanami&quot; on the morning of the next day, sent a radio telegraph message about the capture of Admiral Rozhestvensky, as they were certain to have sunk &quot;Knyaz Suvorov&quot; and assumed the squadron commander went down with the flagship. But cruiser &quot;Akashi&quot;, accompanied by &quot;Sazanami&quot; and &quot;Kagerō&quot;, arrived at Sasebo port in the morning of 30 May with &quot;Byedoviy&quot; in tow, with not only the injured admiral but also the surviving members of the Russian fleet command onboard.

===Conclusion===

Until the evening of 28 May, isolated Russian ships were pursued by the Japanese until almost all were destroyed or captured. The cruiser , which escaped from the Japanese despite being present at Nebogatov&#x27;s surrender, was destroyed by her crew after running aground on the Siberian coast.

The wounded Admiral Rozhestvensky went to the Imperial Japanese Naval Hospital in Sasebo to recover from a head injury caused by shrapnel; there, the victorious Admiral Tōgō visited him personally in plain clothes, comforting him with kind words: &quot;Defeat is a common fate of a soldier. There is nothing to be ashamed of in it. The great point is whether we have performed our duty.&quot;

On 10 June 1905, Tsar Nicholas II sent a telegram:
 &quot;Tokyo. Adjutant General Rozhdestvensky. From the bottom of my heart I thank you and all the ranks of the squadron who honestly fulfilled their duty in battle, for their selfless service to Russia. Your feat was destined to be crowned with success, but your fatherland will always be proud of your selfless courage. I wish you a speedy recovery, and may God console you all.  Nikolai&quot;
Rozhestvensky and other officers were placed on trial in August 1905 after returning to Russia. Rozhestvensky claimed full responsibility for the fiasco and was sentenced to death, but the Tsar commuted his death sentence. Flag captains Clapier de Colongue (Second Pacific Squadron) and Cross (Third Pacific Squadron), Staff officers Filippinovsky, Leontieff, together with the commanders of the surrendered battleships, Captains Vladimir Smirnov (&quot;Nikolai I&quot;), Nikolai Lishin (&quot;Apraksin&quot;), Sergei Grogoryev (&quot;Senyavin&quot;), and the &quot;Byedoviy&quot; commander Nikolai Baranov were sentenced to 10 years in prison and dismissed from service (Nicholas II pardoned them on 1 May 1909). The executive officer of &quot;Oryol&quot; (who was in charge of the ship at the surrender) Captain 2nd rank K.L.Schwede and other officers were acquitted.

Admiral Nebogatov, who surrendered the fleet, was also sentenced to death, which was commuted to 10 years imprisonment and eventually pardoned by the Tsar. He was released from the Trubetskoy Bastion prison in Peter and Paul Fortress in May 1909.

Following this battle, the Imperial Japanese Navy grew to the third largest in the world after World War I. Tōgō Heihachirō was appointed to Order of Merit by King Edward VII on 21 February 1906, as one of the three first non-Dominion members, before he was enobled as Earl (Count) by Emperor Meiji in 1907. Later, he became the first Japanese cover person of Time magazine on 8 November 1926 issue.

==Contributing factors==
===Commander and crew experience===
Admiral Rozhestvensky faced a more combat-experienced battleship admiral in Tōgō Heihachirō. Admiral Tōgō had already killed two Russian admirals: Stepan Makarov outside of Port Arthur in the battleship &quot;Petropavlovsk&quot; in April 1904, then Wilgelm Vitgeft in his battleship in August of the same year. Before those two deaths, Tōgō had chased Admiral Oskar Starck, also flying his flag in the &quot;Petropavlovsk&quot;, off the battlefield.
Admiral Tōgō and his men had two battleship fleet action experiences, which amounted to over four hours of combat experience in battleship-to-battleship combat at Port Arthur and the Yellow Sea.
The Japanese fleets had practiced gunnery extensively since the beginning of the war, using sub-calibre practice guns mounted in their larger guns.

In contrast, underwent sea trials from 23 August to 13 September 1904 as a brand new ship upon her completion, and the new crew did not have much time for training before she set sail for the Pacific on 15 October 1904. &quot;Borodino&quot;″s sister ship, , started trials on 9 August, started trials the latest on 10 September 1904, leaving (the trials finished in October 1903) as the only ship actually ready for deployment. As the Imperial Russian Navy planned on building 10 &quot;Borodino&quot;-class battleships (5 were ultimately built) with the requirement for thousands of additional crewmen, the basic training, quality and experience of the crew and cadets were far lower than those onboard the battleships in the seasoned Pacific Fleet.
The Imperial Russian Admiralty Council (Адмиралтейств-совет) and the rest of the Admiralty were quite aware of this disadvantage, and opposed the September dispatch plan for the following reasons:
1. The Japanese navy has completed the battle preparations with all the crew having some combat experience.
2. The long voyage is mostly through extreme tropical weather, so a meaningful training is practically impossible on the way.
3. Therefore, the newly created Second Pacific Fleet should conduct training in the Baltic until the next spring while waiting for the rigging of another battleship, , and the purchase of Chilean and Argentine warships.

However, at the council in the imperial presence on 23 August 1904 held at the Peterhof Grand Palace, this opinion was overruled by Admiral Rozhestvensky (Commander in Chief of the Fleet), Navy Minister Avellan, and Tsar Nicholas II; for it was deemed impossible to re-arrange the massive coaling for the long voyage if the navy broke the contract that was already signed with Hamburg-American Steamship Line of Germany.

===Salvo firing director system===
Up to the Battle of the Yellow Sea on 10 August 1904, naval guns were controlled locally by a gunnery officer assigned to that gun or a turret. He specified the elevation and deflection figures, gave the firing order while keeping his eyes on the inclinometers indicating the rolling and pitching angles of the ship, received the fall of shot observation report from the spotter on the mast, calculated the new elevation and deflection to &#x27;walk&#x27; the shots in on the target for the next round, without much means to discern or measure the movements of his own ship and the target. He typically had a view on the horizon, but with the new 12-inch gun&#x27;s range extended to over , his vantage point was lower than desired.

In the months before the battle, the Chief Gunnery Officer of &quot;Asahi&quot;, Lieutenant Commander Katō Hiroharu, aided by a Royal Navy advisor who introduced him to the use of the early mechanical computer Dumaresq in fire control, introduced a system for centrally issuing the gun-laying and salvo-firing orders by voice. Using a central system allowed the spotter to identify a salvo of distant shell splashes much more effectively than trying to identify a single splash among the many in the confusion of fleet-to-fleet combat. Further, the spotter needed to keep track of just one firing at a time as opposed to multiple shots on multiple stopwatches, in addition to having to report to just one officer on the bridge. The &#x27;director&#x27; officer on the bridge had the advantage of having a higher vantage point than in the gun turrets, in addition to being steps away from the ship commander giving orders to change the course and the speed in response to the incoming reports on target movements.

This fire control director system was introduced to other ships in the fleet, and the training and practice on this system were carried out in the months waiting for the arrival of the Baltic Fleet while its progress was reported by the British intelligence from their naval stations at Gibraltar, Malta, Aden (Yemen), Cape of Good Hope, Trincomalee (Ceylon), Singapore and Hong Kong, among other locations.

As a result, Japanese fire was more accurate in the far range (), on top of the advantage they held in the shorter distances using the latest 1903 issue Barr and Stroud FA3 coincidence rangefinders of baselength , which had a range of , while the Russian battleships were equipped with &quot;Lugeol&quot; stadiametric rangefinders from the 1880s (except battleships &quot;Oslyabya&quot; and &quot;Navarin&quot;, which had the Barr and Stroud 1895 issue FA2 of baselength retrofitted), which only had a range of about .

===Wireless telegraphy===
The wireless telegraph (radio) had been invented during the last half of the 1890s, and by the turn of the century, nearly all major navies were adopting this improved communications technology. Tsushima was &quot;the first major sea battle in which wireless played any role whatsoever&quot;.

Lieutenant Akiyama Saneyuki (who was the key staff to Admiral Tōgō in formulating plans and directives before and during the battle as a Commander, who also went aboard &quot;Nikolai I&quot; to accompany Admiral Nebogatov to &quot;Mikasa&quot; for a formal meeting with Tōgō) had been sent to the United States as a naval attaché in 1897. He witnessed the capabilities of wireless telegraphy firsthand during the Spanish–American War, and sent several memos to the Navy General Staff urging that they push ahead as rapidly as possible to acquire the new technology. The IJN command became heavily interested in the technology; however, it found the Marconi wireless system, which was then operating with the Royal Navy, to be exceedingly expensive.

The Japanese therefore decided to create their own radio sets by setting up a wireless research committee under Professor Kimura Shunkichi, which eventually produced an acceptable system. In 1901, having attained radio transmissions of up to with the Type 34 (34th year of Meiji = 1901) set, the Navy formally adopted wireless telegraphy. Two years later, a laboratory, a factory, and the wireless telegraphy curriculum were set up at Imperial Japanese Navy Mines Training School in Yokosuka to produce the Type 36 (1903) wireless sets, and these were quickly installed on every major warship in the Combined Fleet by the time the war started.

Alexander Stepanovich Popov of the Naval Warfare Institute had built and demonstrated a wireless telegraphy set in 1900. However, technology improvement and production in the Russian empire lagged those of Germany, and &quot;System Slaby-Arco&quot;, originally made by Allgemeine Elektricitäts-Gesellschaft (AEG) and then produced in volume by its successor wireless-set maker Telefunken in Germany (by 1904, this system was in wide use by Kaiserliche Marine) was adopted by the Imperial Russian Navy. Although both sides had early wireless telegraphy, the Russians were using German sets tuned and maintained by German technicians half-way into the voyage, while the Japanese had the advantage of using their own equipment maintained and operated by their own navy specialists trained at the Yokosuka school.

===British support===

The United Kingdom assisted Japan by manufacturing guns and building battleships for the IJN. As the ally in the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, the UK also assisted Japan in intelligence, finance, technology, training and other aspects of the war against Russia. At the time, Britain owned and controlled more harbour facilities around the world – specifically shipyards and coaling stations – than Russia and its allies (France, and to some extent Germany) combined. The UK also obstructed, where possible, Russian attempts to purchase ships and coal. France openly allowed the Baltic Fleet warships into Tangier port before and after the Dogger Bank Incident; and the UK formally protested in the post-Dogger Bank negotiations, pointing out that the &#x27;Neutral&#x27; countries cannot accept warships of the fighting countries into their ports without enforcing internment, and if France is no longer neutral in the war, the UK is obligated to commence military action in support of Japan as required in the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. As a result, the rendezvous point for Rozestvensky and Fölkersahm squadrons was changed from the port of Diego Suarez to the waters around remote islands of Île Sainte-Marie and Nosy Be in Madagascar, and free access to the ports including Saigon and Ba Ngoi port in Cam Ranh Bay was denied for the fleet in French Indochina.

This support created a major logistics problem for around the world deployment of the Baltic Fleet to the Pacific in procuring coal and supplies on the way. At Nosy Be in Madagascar and at Camranh Bay, French Indochina, the fleet was forced to be anchored for about two months each, seriously degrading morale of the crew. By the time it reached the Sea of Japan, the hulls of all the ships in the fleet were heavily fouled in addition to carrying the extra coal otherwise not required on deck.

The Japanese ships, on the other hand, were well maintained in the ample time given by the intelligence. For example, battleship was under repair from November 1904 to April 1905 at Sasebo Naval Arsenal for two 12-inch guns lost and serious damage to the hull from striking a mine. They were divided into battle divisions of as much uniform speed and gun range so that a fleet would not suffer a bottleneck in speed, and the range of guns would not render some ships useless within a group in extended-range combat.

At the end of the Argentine-Chilean naval arms race in 1903, two Chilean-ordered and British-built battleships (then called &quot;Constitución&quot; and &quot;Libertad&quot;) and two Argentine-ordered, Italian-built cruisers (then called &quot;Bernardino Rivadavia&quot; and &quot;Mariano Moreno&quot;) were offered to Russia and the purchase was about to be finalized. Britain stepped in as the mediator of Pacts of May that ended the race, bought the Chilean battleships (which became and ), and brokered the sale of Argentine cruisers to Japan. This support not only limited the growth of the Imperial Russian Navy but also helped IJN in obtaining the Italian-built cruisers (IJN and ) with a strong armour design that enabled IJN to use them on the main line of battle along with the heavier-armoured battleships.

===High explosive and cordite===
The Japanese used mostly high-explosive shells filled with Shimose powder, which was a pure picric acid (as opposed to the French Melinite or the British Lyddite, which were picric acid mixed with collodion (French) or with dinitrobenzene and vaseline (British) for stability). Engineer Shimose Masachika (1860–1911) solved the instability problem of picric acid on contact with iron and other heavy metals by coating the inside of a shell with unpigmented Japanese lacquer and further sealing with wax. Because it was undiluted, Shimose powder had a stronger power in terms of detonation velocity and temperature than other high explosives at the time. These shells had a sensitive Ijuin fuse (named after Vice Admiral Ijuin Gorō) at the base as opposed to the tip of a shell that armed itself when the shell was spun by the rifling. These fuses were designed to explode on contact and wreck the upper structure of ships. The Japanese Navy imported cordite from Great Britain as the smokeless propellant for these Shimose shells, so that the smoke off the muzzle would not impede the visibility for the spotters.

In the early 1890s, Vice Admiral Stepan O. Makarov, then the Chief Inspector of Russian naval artillery, proposed a new 12-inch gun design, and assigned a junior officer, Semyon V. Panpushko, to research the use of picric acid as the explosive in the shell. However, Panpushko died in an accidental explosion in experiment due to the instability. Consequently, high explosive shells remained unreachable for the Russian Navy at the time of the Russo-Japanese War, and the navy continued to use the older armour-piercing rounds with guncotton (Nitrocellulose, Pyroxylin) bursting charges and the insensitive delayed-detonation fuses. They mostly used brown powder or black powder as the propellant, except &quot;Sissoi Veliky&quot; and the four &quot;Borodino&quot;-class ships that used smokeless gunpowder for the main 12-inch guns.

As a result, Japanese hits caused more damage to Russian ships than Russian hits on Japanese ships. Shimose blasts often set the superstructure, the paintwork and the large quantities of coal stored on the decks on fire, and the sight of the spotters on Russian ships was hindered by the large amount of smoke generated by the propellant on each uncoordinated firing. Moreover, the sensitivity difference of the fuse caused the Japanese off-the-target shells to explode upon falling on the water creating a much larger splash that sent destabilizing waves to Russian inclinometers, as opposed to the Russian shells not detonating upon falling on the water. This made an additional difference in the aforementioned shot accuracy by aiding the Japanese spotters to make an easier identification in fall of shot observation.

=== Gun range and rate of fire ===
The Makarov proposal resulted in Model 1895 12-inch gun that extended the range of the previous Model 1886 12-inch Krupp guns (installed on &quot;Imperator Nikolai I&quot; and &quot;Navarin&quot;) from 5–6 km to 11 km (at 15-degrees elevation) at the expense of significantly limited amount of explosives that can be contained in the shell. Reload time was also improved from 2–4 minutes previously to a rated 90 seconds, but in reality, it was 2.5–3 minutes. These guns were installed to &quot;Sissoi Veliky&quot; and the four &quot;Borodino&quot;-class ships.

The four Japanese battleships, &quot;Mikasa&quot;, &quot;Shikishima&quot;, &quot;Fuji&quot; and &quot;Asahi&quot;, had the latest Armstrong 12-inch 40-calibre naval gun designed and manufactured by Sir W.G. Armstrong &amp; Company ahead of its acceptance by the Royal Navy in the UK. These British-built 12-inch guns had a range of 15,000 yards (14 km) at 15-degrees elevation and the rate of fire at 60 seconds with a heavier shell. One of the reasons for the Royal Navy&#x27;s late adoption of this type of gun was the accidental shell explosions in the barrel Japanese battleships experienced up to the Battle of the Yellow Sea in August 1904, which were diagnosed and almost rectified by the Japanese Navy with the use of aforementioned Ijuin Fuse by the time of this battle.

The Russian fleet had 20 of the 1895-issue longer-range 12&quot; guns on five battleships compared to 16 of the Armstrong 12&quot; guns on four battleships for the Japanese. Statistically, this 20% advantage in the number of guns was much more than offset by the 60% disadvantage in the rate of fire difference of one shot in 2.5 minutes versus one minute. The range difference of 11 km versus 14 km translated into a flatter trajectory (smaller elevation and fall angle) for the Japanese shells, which resulted in a better hit rate for the Japanese shots when both sides had an equal distance facing each other in 11 km and shorter range.

The (imperial yacht) and two torpedo boat destroyers &quot;Grozniy&quot; and &quot;Braviy&quot; reached Vladivostok. Protected cruisers, , , and , escaped to the U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay in the Philippines, and were interned. Ammunition ship &quot;Koreya&quot;, transports &quot;Yaroslavl&quot;, &quot;Vladimir&quot;, &quot;Kuronia&quot;, &quot;Voronezh&quot;, &quot;Livonia&quot; and &quot;Meteor&quot; as well as ocean tug &quot;Svir&quot; went to Shanghai and eventually returned home. Destroyer &quot;Bodriy&quot; was interned in Shanghai. Transports &quot;Mercury&quot;, &quot;Tambov&quot;, &quot;Herman Lerke&quot;, &quot;Count Stroganov&quot; and repair ship &quot;Ksenia&quot; were sent home via Saigon. Auxiliary cruisers &quot;Rion&quot; and &quot;Dniepr&quot; eventually reached back home after some raiding activities in the Yellow Sea. Auxiliary cruisers &quot;Kuban&quot; and &quot;Terek&quot; were interned at Batavia in Dutch East Indies by the Netherlands. Auxiliary (merchant) cruiser &quot;Anadyr&quot; escaped to Madagascar. Hospital ships &quot;Orel&quot; and &quot;Kostroma&quot; were captured by the Japanese. &quot;Kostroma&quot; was released afterwards.



===Russian losses===
Russian personnel losses were 216 officers and 4,614 men killed; with 278 officers and 5,629 men taken as Prisoners Of War (POW). Interned in neutral ports were 79 officers and 1,783 men. Escaping to Vladivostok and Diego-Suarez were 62 officers and 1,165 men.

The battle was humiliating for Russia, which lost all its battleships and most of its cruisers and destroyers. The battle effectively ended the Russo-Japanese War in Japan&#x27;s favour. The Russians lost 4,380 killed and 5,917 captured with a further 1,862 interned. Two admirals, Rozhestvensky and Nebogatov, were captured by the Japanese Navy. The second in command of the fleet, Rear Admiral Dmitry Gustavovich von Fölkersahm, after suffering a cerebral hemorrhage on 16 April, died in the night of 24 May 1905 onboard battleship . Vice Admiral Oskar Enqvist fled to Manila onboard cruiser and was interned by the United States.

====Battleships====
The Russians lost eleven battleships, including three smaller coastal battleships, either sunk or captured by the Japanese, or scuttled by their crews to prevent capture. Four were lost to enemy action during the daylight battle on 27 May: , , and . was lost during the night action on 27–28 May, while the and were either scuttled or sunk the next day. Four other battleships, under Rear Admiral Nebogatov, were forced to surrender and would end up as prizes of war. This group consisted of only one modern battleship, , along with the old battleship and two small coastal battleships and .

====Cruisers====
The Russian Navy lost five of its nine cruisers during the battle, three more were interned by the Americans, with just one reaching Vladivostok. and were sunk the next day after the daylight battle. The cruiser fought against six Japanese cruisers on the 28th and barely survived with many officers and crew killed onboard, and was scuttled on 29 May 1905 due to heavy damage. &quot;Izumrud&quot; ran aground on the Siberian coast. Three Russian protected cruisers, , , and , escaped to the U.S. naval base at Manila in the then-American-controlled Philippines where they were interned by the United States. The armed yacht (classified as a cruiser) , alone was able to reach Vladivostok.

====Destroyers and auxiliaries====
Imperial Russia also lost six of its nine destroyers in the battle, had one interned by the Chinese, and the other two reached Vladivostok. &quot;Buyniy&quot; (&quot;Буйный&quot;), &quot;Bezuprechniy&quot; (&quot;Безупречный&quot;), &quot;Gromkiy&quot; (&quot;Громкий&quot;) and &quot;Blestyashchiy&quot; (&quot;Блестящий&quot;) were sunk on 27 May. &quot;Bistriy&quot; (&quot;Быстрый&quot;) was beached and destroyed by her crew the next day. &quot;Byedoviy&quot; (&quot;Бедовый&quot;) surrendered also on 28 May. Destroyer &quot;Bodriy&quot; (&quot;Бодрый&quot;) ran out of coal, and was interned in Shanghai. &quot;Grozniy&quot; (&quot;Грозный&quot;) and &quot;Braviy&quot; (&quot;Бравый&quot;) reached Vladivostok.

Of the auxiliaries, repair ship &quot;Kamchatka&quot;, auxiliary cruiser and ocean tug &quot;Rus&quot; were sunk on 27 May, auxiliary cruiser &quot;Irtysh&quot; was disabled, abandoned on 28 May, then sank on 29 May. Ammunition ship &quot;Koreya&quot; and ocean tug &quot;Svir&quot; reached Shanghai and returned home. After being ordered to separate from the fleet on 22 May, auxiliary cruisers &quot;Kuban&quot; and &quot;Terek&quot; were interned at Batavia in Dutch East Indies by the Netherlands on 9 June 1905 after raiding a British and a Danish steamer destined for Japan. Transports &quot;Yaroslavl&quot;, &quot;Vladimir&quot;, &quot;Kuronia&quot;, &quot;Voronezh&quot;, &quot;Livonia&quot; and &quot;Meteor&quot; were detached from the fleet on 25 May, reached Shanghai and returned home. Auxiliary cruisers &quot;Rion&quot; and &quot;Dniepr&quot; escorted the transports to Shanghai, engaged in commerce raiding activities in the Yellow Sea, and returned to Kronstadt on 31 July 1905. Transports &quot;Mercury&quot;, &quot;Tambov&quot;, &quot;Herman Lerke&quot;, &quot;Count Stroganov&quot; and repair ship &quot;Ksenia&quot;, which accompanied the Third Pacific Fleet to Cam Ranh Bay, had been sent home via Saigon. Merchant cruiser &quot;Anadyr&quot; escaped to Madagascar and then returned home. The hospital ships &quot;Orel&quot; and &quot;Kostroma&quot; were captured during the battle; &quot;Kostroma&quot; was released afterwards.

===Japanese losses===
The Japanese lost three torpedo boats (Nos. &quot;34&quot;, &quot;35&quot; and &quot;69&quot;). Personnel losses were 117 officers and men killed and 583 officers and men wounded.

===Political consequences===
Imperial Russia&#x27;s prestige was badly damaged and the defeat was a blow to the Romanov dynasty. Most of the Russian fleet was lost; the fast armed yacht &quot;Almaz&quot; (classified as a cruiser of the 2nd rank) and the destroyers &quot;Grozny&quot; and &quot;Bravy&quot; were the only Russian ships to reach Vladivostok. In &quot;The Guns of August&quot;, the American historian and author Barbara Tuchman argued that because Russia&#x27;s loss destabilized the balance of power in Europe, it emboldened the Central Powers and contributed to their decision to go to war in 1914.

The battle had a profound cultural and political impact on the world. It was the first defeat of a European power by an Asian nation in the modern era. It also heightened the alarm of &quot;The Yellow Peril&quot; as well as weakening the notion of white superiority that was prevalent in some Western countries. Mahatma Gandhi (India), Mustafa Kemal Atatürk (Turkey), Sun Yat-sen (China) and Jawaharlal Nehru (India) were amongst the future national leaders to celebrate this defeat of a colonial power. The victory established Japan as the sixth greatest naval power while the Russian navy declined to one barely stronger than that of Austria-Hungary.

In &quot;The Guinness Book of Decisive Battles&quot;, the British historian Geoffrey Regan argues that the victory bolstered Japan&#x27;s increasingly aggressive political and military establishment. According to Regan, the lopsided Japanese victory at Tsushima:...created a legend that was to haunt Japan&#x27;s leaders for forty years. A British admiral once said, &#x27;It takes three years to build a ship, but 300 years to build a tradition.&#x27; Japan thought that the victory had completed this task in a matter of a few years ... It had all been too easy. Looking at Tōgō&#x27;s victory over one of the world&#x27;s great powers convinced some Japanese military men that with more ships, and bigger and better ones, similar victories could be won throughout the Pacific. Perhaps no power could resist the Japanese navy, not even Britain and the United States.

Regan also believes the victory contributed to the Japanese road to later disaster, &quot;because the result was so misleading. Certainly the Japanese navy had performed well, but its opponents had been weak, and it was not invincible... Tōgō&#x27;s victory [helped] set Japan on a path that would eventually lead her&quot; to the Second World War.

Takano Isoroku, the future Japanese admiral Yamamoto Isoroku who would plan the attack on Pearl Harbor and command the Imperial Japanese Navy through much of the Second World War, served as a junior officer (aboard ) during the battle and was wounded and lost two fingers by an accidental explosion of an 8-inch shell in a forward gun. Had he lost a third, he would have been medically discharged from the IJN.

===Dreadnought arms race===

Prior to the Russo-Japanese War, countries constructed their battleships with mixed batteries of mainly 6-inch (152 mm), 8-inch (203 mm), 10-inch (254 mm) and 12-inch (305 mm) guns, with the intent that these battleships fight on the battle line in a close-quarter, decisive fleet action. The Battle of Tsushima conclusively demonstrated that faster battleships and big guns with longer ranges were superior to batteries of mixed-size guns.
Britain&#x27;s First Sea Lord, Admiral Jackie Fisher, reasoned that the Japanese victory at Tsushima confirmed the importance of large guns and speed for modern battleships. Captain William Pakenham of the British Royal Navy, who had been present aboard the Japanese battleship &quot;Asahi&quot; as an official observer during the Tsushima Battle, &quot;famously remarked...the effect of the fire of every gun is so much less than that of the next larger size, that when 12in guns are firing, shots from 10in pass unnoticed...everything in this war has tended to emphasize the vast importance to a ship, at every stage of her career, of carrying some of the heaviest and furthest shooting guns that can be got into her.&quot; In October 1905 the British started the construction of , which marked the beginning of a naval arms race between Britain and Germany in the years before 1914.

The battle also accelerated the naval arms race on a geopolitical level; though the Anglo-German naval arms race had begun in 1897, the collapse of Russian naval power in 1905 allowed Britain to send the bulk of its naval forces to other regions, reassured by the naval superiority of its ally Japan in the Far East. In turn, the presence of a larger British fleet in Europe meant that the Germans must build a proportionally larger fleet to maintain the same relative power, in accordance with Tirpitz&#x27;s fleet in being principle. The Royal Navy, in turn, must increase its fleet size to maintain the relative power as set out by its two-power standard. This positive feedback meant that any external increase in the regional naval power of one side – in this case, the British – would precipitate not just a proportional increase in naval power from the opposing side, but rather a &quot;mutual&quot; multi-stage build-up in naval power on both sides, before settling to a higher equilibrium. Ultimately, the Germans passed three of its five Fleet Acts after Tsushima within a span of 6 years.

Upon the breakout of World War I, the British and Germans were both aware of the potentially devastating consequences of a naval defeat on the scale of Tsushima. Britain needed its battle fleet to protect its empire, and the trade routes vital to its war effort. Winston Churchill, then First Lord of the Admiralty, described British Admiral John Jellicoe as &quot;the only man who on either side could lose the war in an afternoon.&quot; German naval commanders, for their part, understood the importance Kaiser Wilhelm II attached to his navy and the diplomatic prestige it carried. As a result of caution, the British and German fleets met in only one major action in World War I, the indecisive Battle of Jutland.

==On film==
The battle has been the main focus for two historical films in Japan. The first, 1969&#x27;s &quot;Battle of the Japan Sea&quot; (日本海大海戦, &quot;Nihonkai Daikaisen&quot;), directed by Seiji Maruyama, starring Toshiro Mifune as Admiral Tōgō, with music by Masaru Sato and special effects by Eiji Tsuburaya. It was dramatized again in 1983&#x27;s &quot;Battle Anthem&quot; (日本海大海戦・海ゆかば, &quot;Nihonkai DaikaisenUmi Yukaba&quot;) with Mifune reprising his role.

Another, more recent, depiction is episode 4, season 3 of the 2009–2011 NHK taiga drama series (lit. &quot;Clouds Above the Slope&quot;).

<text>The Abenaki (Abenaki: &quot;Wαpánahki&quot;) are Indigenous people of the Northeastern Woodlands of Canada and the United States. They are an Algonquian-speaking people and part of the Wabanaki Confederacy. The Eastern Abenaki language was predominantly spoken in Maine, while the Western Abenaki language was spoken in Quebec, Vermont, and New Hampshire.

While Abenaki peoples have shared cultural traits, they did not historically have a centralized government. They came together as a post-contact community after their original tribes were decimated by colonization, disease, and warfare.

==Names==
The word &quot;Abenaki&quot; and its syncope, &quot;Abnaki,&quot; are both derived from &quot;Wabanaki&quot;, or &quot;Wôbanakiak,&quot; meaning &quot;People of the Dawn Land&quot; in the Abenaki language. While the two terms are often confused, the Abenaki are one of several tribes in the Wabanaki Confederacy.

Alternate spellings include: &quot;Abnaki&quot;, &quot;Abinaki&quot;, &quot;Alnôbak&quot;, &quot;Abanakee&quot;, &quot;Abanaki&quot;, &quot;Abanaqui&quot;, &quot;Abanaquois&quot;, &quot;Abenaka&quot;, &quot;Abenake&quot;, &quot;Abenaki&quot;, &quot;Abenakias&quot;, &quot;Abenakiss&quot;, &quot;Abenakkis&quot;, &quot;Abenaque&quot;, &quot;Abenaqui&quot;, &quot;Abenaquioict&quot;, &quot;Abenaquiois&quot;, &quot;Abenaquioue&quot;, &quot;Abenati&quot;, &quot;Abeneaguis&quot;, &quot;Abenequa&quot;, &quot;Abenkai&quot;, &quot;Abenquois&quot;, &quot;Abernaqui&quot;, &quot;Abnaqui&quot;, &quot;Abnaquies&quot;, &quot;Abnaquois&quot;, &quot;Abnaquotii&quot;, &quot;Abasque&quot;, &quot;Abnekais&quot;, &quot;Abneki&quot;, &quot;Abonakies&quot;, &quot;Abonnekee&quot;.

&quot;Wôbanakiak&quot; is derived from &quot;wôban&quot; (&quot;dawn&quot; or &quot;east&quot;) and &quot;aki&quot; (&quot;land&quot;) (compare Proto-Algonquian &quot;*wa·pan&quot; and &quot;*axkyi&quot;) — the aboriginal name of the area broadly corresponding to New England and the Maritimes. It is sometimes used to refer to all the Algonquian-speaking peoples of the area—Western Abenaki, Eastern Abenaki, Wolastoqiyik-Passamaquoddy, and Mi&#x27;kmaq—as a single group.

The Abenaki people also call themselves &quot;Alnôbak&quot;, meaning &quot;Real People&quot; (c.f., Lenape language: &quot;Lenapek&quot;) and by the autonym &quot;Alnanbal,&quot; meaning &quot;men&quot;.

Historically, ethnologists have classified the Abenaki by geographic groups: &quot;Western Abenaki&quot; and &quot;Eastern Abenaki&quot;. Within these groups are the Abenaki bands:

==Western Abenaki==
* &quot;Androscoggin&quot; (also &quot;Arsigantegok&quot; &quot;Arrasaguntacook&quot;, &quot;Ersegontegog&quot;, &quot;Assagunticook&quot;, &quot;Anasaguntacook&quot;), lived along the St. Francis River in Québec. Principal village: St. Francis (Odanak). The people were referred to as &quot;St. Francis River Abenakis&quot;, and this term gradually was applied to all Western Abenaki.
* &quot;Cowasuck&quot; (also &quot;Cohass&quot;, &quot;Cohasiac&quot;, &quot;Koasek&quot;, &quot;Koasek&quot;, &quot;Coos&quot; – &quot;People of the Pines&quot;), lived in the upper Connecticut River Valley. Principal village: &quot;Cowass&quot;, near Newbury, Vermont.
* &quot;Missiquoi&quot; (also &quot;Masipskwoik&quot;, &quot;Mazipskikskoik&quot;, &quot;Missique&quot;, &quot;Misiskuoi&quot;, &quot;Missisco&quot;, &quot;Missiassik&quot; – &quot;People of the Flint&quot;), also known as the Sokoki. They lived in the Missisquoi Valley, from Lake Champlain to the headwaters. Principal village around Swanton, Vermont.

* &quot;Passamaquoddy&quot; (also &quot;Peskotomuhktati&quot;, &quot;Pestomuhkati&quot;), lived on the Passamaquoddy Bay coast and inland, between the St. John, St. Croix and Penobscot rivers, in present-day Maine and New Brunswick. Principal village: Machias. Now a separate federally recognized tribe.

==Location==
The homeland of the Abenaki, called &quot;Ndakinna&quot; (Our Land; alternately written as &quot;N&#x27;dakinna&quot; or &quot;N&#x27;Dakinna&quot;), previously extended across most of what is now northern New England, southern Quebec, and the southern Canadian Maritimes. The Eastern Abenaki population was concentrated in portions of New Brunswick and Maine east of New Hampshire&#x27;s White Mountains. The other major group, the Western Abenaki, lived in the Connecticut River valley in Vermont, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts. The Missiquoi lived along the eastern shore of Lake Champlain. The Pennacook lived along the Merrimack River in southern New Hampshire. The maritime Abenaki lived around the St. Croix and Wolastoq (Saint John River) Valleys near the boundary line between Maine and New Brunswick.

English colonial settlement in New England and frequent violence forced many Abenaki to migrate to Quebec. The Abenaki settled in the Sillery region of Quebec between 1676 and 1680, and subsequently, for about twenty years, lived on the banks of the Chaudière River near the falls, before settling in Odanak and Wôlinak in the early eighteenth century.

In those days, the Abenaki practiced a subsistence economy based on hunting, fishing, trapping, berry picking and on growing corn, beans, squash, potatoes and tobacco. They also produced baskets, made of ash and sweet grass, for picking wild berries, and boiled maple sap to make syrup. Basket weaving remains a traditional activity practiced by some tribal members.

During the Anglo-French wars, the Abenaki were allies of France, having been displaced from Ndakinna by immigrating English settlers. An anecdote from the period tells the story of a Wolastoqew war chief named Nescambuit (variant spellings include Assacumbuit), who killed more than 140 enemies of King Louis XIV of France and received the rank of knight. Not all Abenaki natives fought on the side of the French, however; many remained on their native lands in the northern colonies. Much of the trapping was done by the people and traded to the English colonists for durable goods. These contributions by Native American Abenaki peoples went largely unreported.

Two tribal communities formed in Canada, one once known as Saint-Francois-du-lac near Pierreville (now called Odanak, Abenaki for &quot;coming home&quot;), and the other near Bécancour (now known as Wôlinak) on the south shore of the St. Lawrence River, directly across the river from Trois-Rivières. These two Abenaki reserves continue to grow and develop. Since the year 2000, the total Abenaki population (on and off reserve) has doubled to 2,101 members in 2011. Approximately 400 Abenaki reside on these two reserves, which cover a total area of less than . The unrecognized majority are off-reserve members, living in various cities and towns across Canada and the United States.

There are about 3,200 Abenaki living in Vermont and New Hampshire, without reservations, chiefly around Lake Champlain. The remaining Abenaki people live in multi-racial towns and cities across Canada and the US, mainly in Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, and northern New England.

In December 2012, the Nulhegan Band of the Coosuk Abenaki Nation created a tribal forest in the town of Barton, Vermont. This forest was established with assistance from the Vermont Sierra Club and the Vermont Land Trust. It contains a hunting camp and maple sugaring facilities that are administered cooperatively by the Nulhegan. The forest contains . The Missiquoi Abenaki Tribe owns forest land in the town of Brunswick, Vermont, centered around the Brunswick Springs. These springs are believed to be a sacred Abenaki site.

==Language==
The Abenaki language is closely related to the Panawahpskek (Penobscot) language. Other neighboring Wabanaki tribes, the Pestomuhkati (Passamaquoddy), Wolastoqiyik (Maliseet), and Mi&#x27;kmaq, and other Eastern Algonquian languages share many linguistic similarities. It has come close to extinction as a spoken language. Tribal members are working to revive the Abenaki language at Odanak (means &quot;in the village&quot;), a First Nations Abenaki reserve near Pierreville, Quebec, and throughout New Hampshire, Vermont, and New York state.

The language is polysynthetic, meaning that a phrase or an entire sentence is expressed by a single word. For example, the word for &quot;white man&quot; &quot;awanoch&quot; is a combination of the words &quot;awani&quot; meaning &quot;who&quot; and &quot;uji&quot; meaning &quot;from&quot;. Thus, the word for &quot;white man&quot; literally translates to &quot;Who is this man and where does he come from?&quot;

==History==
There is archaeological evidence of indigenous people in what is today New Hampshire for at least 12,000 years.

In &quot;Reflections in Bullough&#x27;s Pond&quot;, historian Diana Muir argues that the Abenakis&#x27; neighbors, pre-contact Iroquois, were an imperialist, expansionist culture whose cultivation of the corn/beans/squash agricultural complex enabled them to support a large population. They made war primarily against neighboring Algonquian peoples, including the Abenaki. Muir uses archaeological data to argue that the Iroquois expansion onto Algonquian lands was checked by the Algonquian adoption of agriculture. This enabled them to support their own populations large enough to have sufficient warriors to defend against the threat of Iroquois conquest.

In 1614, Thomas Hunt captured 24 Abenaki people, including Squanto (Tisquantum) and took them to Spain, where they were sold into slavery. During the European colonization of North America, the land occupied by the Abenaki was in the area between the new colonies of England in Massachusetts and the French in Quebec. Since no party agreed to territorial boundaries, there was regular conflict among them. The Abenaki were traditionally allied with the French; during the reign of Louis XIV, Chief Assacumbuit was designated a member of the French nobility for his service.

Around 1669, the Abenaki started to emigrate to Quebec due to conflicts with English colonists and epidemics of new infectious diseases. The governor of New France allocated two seigneuries (large self-administered areas similar to feudal fiefs). The first, of what was later to become Indian reserves, was on the Saint Francis River and is now known as the &quot;Odanak&quot; Indian Reserve; the second was founded near Bécancour and is called the &quot;Wôlinak&quot; Indian Reserve.

===Abenaki wars===
When the Wampanoag under King Philip (Metacomet) fought the English colonists in New England in 1675 in King Philip&#x27;s War, the Abenaki joined the Wampanoag. For three years they fought along the Maine frontier in the First Abenaki War. The Abenaki pushed back the line of white settlement through devastating raids on scattered farmhouses and small villages. The war was settled by a peace treaty in 1678, with the Wampanoag more than decimated and many native survivors having been sold into slavery in Bermuda.

During Queen Anne&#x27;s War in 1702, the Abenaki were allied with the French; they raided numerous English colonial settlements in Maine, from Wells to Casco, killing about 300 settlers over ten years. They also occasionally raided into Massachusetts, for instance in Groton and Deerfield in 1704. The raids stopped when the war ended. Some captives were adopted into the Mohawk and Abenaki tribes; older captives were generally ransomed, and the colonies carried on a brisk trade.

The Third Abenaki War (1722–25), called the Dummer&#x27;s War or Father Rale&#x27;s War, erupted when the French Jesuit missionary Sébastien Rale (or Rasles, ~1657?-1724) encouraged the Abenaki to halt the spread of Yankee settlements. When the Massachusetts militia tried to seize Rale, the Abenaki raided the settlements at Brunswick, Arrowsick, and Merry-Meeting Bay. The Massachusetts government then declared war and bloody battles were fought at Norridgewock (1724), where Rale was killed, and at a daylong battle at the Indian village near present-day Fryeburg, Maine, on the upper Saco River (1725). Peace conferences at Boston and Casco Bay brought an end to the war. After Rale died, the Abenaki moved to a settlement on the St. Francis River.

The Abenaki from St. Francois continued to raid British settlements in their former homelands along the New England frontier during Father Le Loutre&#x27;s War (see Northeast Coast campaign (1750)) and the French and Indian War.

===Canada===
The development of tourism projects has allowed the Canadian Abenaki to develop a modern economy, while preserving their culture and traditions. For example, since 1960, the Odanak Historical Society has managed the first and one of the largest aboriginal museums in Quebec, a few miles from the Quebec-Montreal axis. Over 5,000 people visit the Abenaki Museum annually. Several Abenaki companies include: in Wôlinak, General Fiberglass Engineering employs a dozen natives, with annual sales exceeding C$3 million. Odanak is now active in transportation and distribution. Notable Abenaki from this area include the documentary filmmaker Alanis Obomsawin (National Film Board of Canada).

===United States===

====Maine: federally recognized tribes====
The Penobscot Indian Nation, Passamaquoddy people, and Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians have been federally recognized as tribes in the United States.

====Vermont: state-recognized tribes====
Nulhegan Band of the Coosuk Abenaki Nation, Koasek Abenaki Tribe, Elnu Abenaki Tribe, and the Missisquoi Abenaki Tribe are, as of 2011, all state-recognized tribes in the United States.

The Missisquoi Abenaki applied for federal recognition as an Indian tribe in the 1980s but failed to meet four of the seven criteria. The Bureau of Indian Affairs found that less than 1 percent of the Missisquoi&#x27;s 1,171 members could show descent from an Abenaki ancestor. The bureau&#x27;s report concluded that the petitioner is &quot;a collection of individuals of claimed but mostly undemonstrated Indian ancestry with little or no social or historical connection with each other before the early 1970s.&quot;

State recognition allows applicants to seek certain scholarship funds reserved for American Indians and to for members to market artwork as American Indian or Native American-made under the 1990 Indian Arts and Crafts Act.

In 2002, the State of Vermont reported that the Abenaki people have not had a &quot;continuous presence&quot; in the state and had migrated north to Quebec by the end of the 17th century. Facing annihilation, many Abenaki had begun emigrating to Canada, then under French control, around 1669.

=====&quot;Race-shifting&quot; controversy=====
The Abenaki Nation, based in Quebec, claim that those self-identifying as Abenaki in Vermont are settlers making false claims to Indigenous ancestry. While the Odanak and Wolinak Abenaki First Nations in Quebec initially believed claims from residents of Vermont who said they were Abenaki, the Odanak reversed their position in 2003, calling on the groups in Vermont to provide them with genealogical evidence of Indigenous ancestry.

Scholars have not been able to find credible evidence of the Vermont Abenaki&#x27;s claims of Indigenous ancestry. Anthropological research from the first half of the 20th century indicates that no Abenaki community actively existed in Vermont during that time period.

Researcher Darryl Leroux characterizes the Vermont Abenaki&#x27;s claims of Abenaki ancestry as &quot;race-shifting&quot;, arguing that genealogical and archival evidence shows that most members of the state-recognized tribes are descended from white French Canadians. Leroux found that only 2.2 percent of the Missisquoi Abenaki membership has Abenaki ancestry, with the rest of the organization&#x27;s root ancestors being primarily French Canadian and migrating to Vermont in the mid-19th century. The Abenaki Nation of Missisquoi&#x27;s shifting claims about its root ancestors as well as loose membership criteria are consistent with race-shifting patterns.

Leroux&#x27;s research prompted renewed calls by the Abenaki First Nations to reassess Vermont&#x27;s state recognition process.

====New Hampshire and minority recognition====
New Hampshire does not recognize any Abenaki tribes. It has no federally recognized tribes or state-recognized tribes; however, it established the New Hampshire Commission on Native American Affairs in 2010. The various Cowasuck, Abenaki and other Native and heritage groups are represented to the commission.

In 2021, a bill was introduced to the New Hampshire legislature to allow New Hampshire communities to rename locations in the Abenaki language. This bill did not pass.

==Culture==
There are a dozen variations of the name &quot;Abenaki&quot;, such as Abenaquiois, Abakivis, Quabenakionek, Wabenakies and others.

The Abenaki were described in the &quot;Jesuit Relations&quot; as not cannibals, and as docile, ingenious, temperate in the use of liquor, and not profane.

Abenaki lifeways were similar to those of Algonquian-speaking peoples of southern New England. They cultivated food crops and built villages on or near fertile river floodplains. They also hunted game, fished, and gathered wild plants and fungi.

Unlike the Haudenosaunee, the Abenaki were patrilineal. Each man had different hunting territories inherited through his father.

Most of the year, Abenaki lived in dispersed bands of extended families. Bands came together during the spring and summer at seasonal villages near rivers, or somewhere along the seacoast for planting and fishing. During the winter, the Abenaki lived in small groups further inland. These villages occasionally had to be fortified, depending on the alliances and enemies of other tribes or of Europeans near the village. Abenaki villages were quite small with an average number of 100 residents.

Most Abenaki crafted dome-shaped, bark-covered wigwams for housing, though a few preferred oval-shaped longhouses. During the winter, the Abenaki lined the inside of their conical wigwams with bear and deer skins for warmth.

===Gender, food, division of labor, and other cultural traits===
The Abenaki were a farming society that supplemented agriculture with hunting and gathering. Generally the men were the hunters. The women tended the fields and grew the crops. In their fields, they planted the crops in groups of &quot;sisters&quot;. The three sisters were grown together: the stalk of corn supported the beans, and squash or pumpkins provided ground cover and reduced weeds. The men would hunt bears, deer, fish, and birds.

The Abenaki were a patrilineal society, which was common among New England tribes. In this they differed from the six Iroquois tribes to the west in New York, and from many other North American Native tribes who had matrilineal societies.

Groups used the consensus method to make important decisions.

===Storytelling===
Storytelling is a major part of Abenaki culture. It is used not only as entertainment but also as a teaching method. The Abenaki view stories as having lives of their own and being aware of how they are used. Stories were used as a means of teaching children behavior. Children were not to be mistreated, and so instead of punishing the child, they would be told a story.

One of the stories is of Azban the Raccoon. This is a story about a proud raccoon that challenges a waterfall to a shouting contest. When the waterfall does not respond, Azban dives into the waterfall to try to outshout it; he is swept away because of his pride. This story would be used to show a child the pitfalls of pride.

===Mythology===
===Ethnobotany===
The Abenaki smash the flowers and leaves of &quot;Ranunculus acris&quot; and sniff them for headaches. They consume the fruit of &quot;Vaccinium myrtilloides&quot; as part of their traditional diet. They also use the fruit and the grains of &quot;Viburnum nudum var. cassinoides&quot; for food.

Many other plants are used for various healing and treatment modalities, including for the skin, as a disinfectant, as a cure-all, as a respiratory aid, for colds, coughs, fevers, grippe, gas, blood strengthening, headaches and other pains, rheumatism, demulcent, nasal inflammation, anthelmintic, for the eyes, abortifacent, for the bones, antihemorrhagic, as a sedative, anaphrodisiac, swellings, urinary aid, gastrointestinal aid, as a hemostat, pediatric aid (such as for teething), and other unspecified or general uses.

They use &quot;Hierochloe odorata&quot; (sweetgrass), &quot;Apocynum&quot; (dogbane), &quot;Betula papyrifera&quot; (paper birch), &quot;Fraxinus americana&quot; (white ash), &quot;Fraxinus nigra&quot; (black ash), &quot;Laportea canadensis&quot; (Canada nettle), a variety of &quot;Salix&quot; species, and &quot;Tilia americana&quot; (basswood, or American linden) var. &quot;Americana&quot; for making baskets, canoes, snowshoes, and whistles. They use &quot;Hierochloe odorata&quot; and willow to make containers, &quot;Betula papyrifera&quot; to create containers, moose calls and other utilitarian pieces, and the bark of &quot;Cornus sericea&quot; (red osier dogwood) ssp. sericea for smoking.

They also use &quot;Acer rubrum&quot;, &quot;Acornus calamus&quot;, an unknown &quot;Amelanchier&quot; species, &quot;Caltha palustris&quot;, &quot;Cardamine diphylla&quot;, &quot;Cornus canadensis&quot;, an unknown &quot;Crataegus&quot; species, &quot;Fragaria virginiana&quot;, &quot;Gaultheria procumbens&quot;, &quot;Osmunda cinnamomea&quot;, &quot;Phaseolus vulgaris&quot;, &quot;Photinia melanocarpa&quot;, &quot;Prunus virginiana&quot;, &quot;Rubus idaeus&quot; and another unknown &quot;Rubus&quot; species, &quot;Solanum tuberosum&quot;, &quot;Spiraea alba&quot; var. &quot;latifolia&quot;, &quot;Vaccinium angustifolium&quot;, and &quot;Zea mays&quot; as a tea, soup, jelly, sweetener, condiment, snack, or meal.

The Abenaki use the gum of &quot;Abies balsamea&quot; for slight itches and as an antiseptic ointment. They stuff the leaves, needles and wood into pillows as a panacea.

==Population and epidemics==
Before the Abenaki, except the Pennacook and Mi&#x27;kmaq, had contact with the European world, their population may have numbered as many as 40,000. Around 20,000 would have been Eastern Abenaki, another 10,000 would have been Western Abenaki, and the last 10,000 would have been Maritime Abenaki. Early contact with European fishermen resulted in two major epidemics that affected Abenaki during the 16th century. The first epidemic was an unknown sickness occurring sometime between 1564 and 1570, and the second one was typhus in 1586. Multiple epidemics arrived a decade prior to the English colonization of Massachusetts in 1620, when three separate sicknesses swept across New England and the Canadian Maritimes. Maine was hit very hard during the year of 1617, with a fatality rate of 75 per, and the population of the Eastern Abenaki fell to about 5,000. The more isolated Western Abenaki suffered fewer fatalities, losing about half of their original population of 10,000.

The new diseases continued to strike in epidemics, starting with smallpox in 1631, 1633, and 1639. Seven years later, an unknown epidemic struck, with influenza passing through the following year. Smallpox affected the Abenaki again in 1649, and diphtheria came through 10 years later. Smallpox struck in 1670, and influenza in 1675. Smallpox affected the Native Americans in 1677, 1679, 1687, along with measles, 1691, 1729, 1733, 1755, and finally in 1758.

The Abenaki population continued to decline, but in 1676, they took in thousands of refugees from many southern New England tribes displaced by settlement and King Philip&#x27;s War. Because of this, descendants of nearly every southern New England Algonquian tribe can be found among the Abenaki people. A century later, fewer than 1,000 Abenaki remained after the American Revolution.

In the 1990 US census, 1,549 people identified themselves as Abenaki. So did 2,544 people in the 2000 US census, with 6,012 people claiming Abenaki heritage. In 1991 Canadian Abenaki numbered 945; by 2006 they numbered 2,164.

==Fiction==

Lydia Maria Child wrote of the Abenaki in her short story, &quot;The Church in the Wilderness&quot; (1828). Several Abenaki characters and much about their 18th-century culture are featured in the Kenneth Roberts&#x27; novel &quot;Arundel&quot; (1930). The film &quot;Northwest Passage&quot; (1940) is based on a novel of the same name by Roberts.

The Abenaki are featured in Charles McCarry&#x27;s historical novel &quot;Bride of the Wilderness&quot; (1988), and James Archibald Houston&#x27;s novel &quot;Ghost Fox&quot; (1977), both of which are set in the eighteenth century; and in Jodi Picoult&#x27;s &quot;Second Glance&quot; (2003) and &quot;Lone Wolf&quot; (2012) novels, set in the contemporary world. Books for younger readers both have historical settings: Joseph Bruchac&#x27;s &quot;The Arrow Over the Door&quot; (1998) (grades 4–6) is set in 1777; and Beth Kanell&#x27;s young adult novel, &quot;The Darkness Under the Water&quot; (2008), concerns a young Abenaki-French Canadian girl during the time of the Vermont Eugenics Project, 1931–1936.

The first sentence in Norman Mailer&#x27;s novel &quot;Harlot&#x27;s Ghost&quot; makes reference to the Abenaki: &quot;On a late-winter evening in 1983, while driving through fog along the Maine coast, recollections of old campfires began to drift into the March mist, and I thought of the Abnaki Indians of the Algonquin tribe who dwelt near Bangor a thousand years ago.&quot;

==Non-fiction==
Letters and other non-fiction writing can be found in the anthology &quot;Dawnland Voices&quot;, edited by Siobhan Senier. Selections include letters from leader of the early praying town, Wamesit in Massachusetts Samuel Numphow, Sagamore Kancamagus, and writings on the Abenaki language by former chief of the reserve at Odanak in Quebec, Joseph Laurent, as well as many others.

Accounts of life with the Abenaki can be found in the captivity narratives written by women taken captive by the Abenaki from the early New England settlements: Mary Rowlandson (1682), Hannah Duston (1702); Elizabeth Hanson (1728); Susannah Willard Johnson (1754); and Jemima Howe (1792).

<doc id="55013" wikidata="Q180582" url="?curid=55013" title="Bauhaus (band)">
<text>Bauhaus are an English rock band formed in Northampton in 1978. Known for their dark image and gloomy sound, Bauhaus are one of the pioneers of gothic rock, although they mixed many genres, including dub, glam rock, psychedelia, and funk. The group consisted of Daniel Ash (guitar, saxophone), Peter Murphy (vocals, occasional instruments), Kevin Haskins (drums) and David J (bass).

The band formed under the name Bauhaus 1919, in reference to the first operating year of the German art school Bauhaus, but they shortened this name within a year of formation. Their 1979 debut single &quot;Bela Lugosi&#x27;s Dead&quot; is considered one of the harbingers of gothic rock music and has been influential on contemporary goth culture. Their debut album, &quot;In the Flat Field&quot;, is regarded as one of the first gothic rock records. Their 1981 second album &quot;Mask&quot; expanded their sound by incorporating a wider variety of instruments—such as keyboards, saxophone and acoustic guitar—and experimenting with funk-inspired rhythms on tracks like &quot;Kick in the Eye&quot;. Bauhaus went on to achieve mainstream success in the United Kingdom with their third album, &quot;The Sky&#x27;s Gone Out&quot;, which peaked at No. 3 on the UK Albums Chart in 1982. That same year, they also reached No. 15 on the Singles Chart with a standalone cover of David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot;, earning them an appearance on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. During recording sessions for their next album, Murphy fell ill and spent much of his time away from the studio, leaving the rest of the band to compensate for his absence. This created a rift between the singer and his bandmates, culminating in the group&#x27;s dissolution on 5 July 1983, one week before &quot;Burning from the Inside&quot; was released. Featuring the Top 30 UK single &quot;She&#x27;s in Parties&quot;, it would be their final studio album composed entirely of new material for a quarter of a century.

After Bauhaus&#x27; breakup, Murphy formed Dalis Car with bassist Mick Karn before beginning a solo career later on, while Ash and Haskins continued as Tones on Tail and, later, reunited with David J to form Love and Rockets. Murphy&#x27;s solo career enjoyed greater commercial success in the United States than Bauhaus, as did Love and Rockets. Bauhaus eventually reunited for a 1998 tour, again from 2005 to 2008, and in 2019 and 2022.

==History==

Daniel Ash, his friend David J. Haskins and Haskins&#x27; younger brother Kevin had played together in various bands since childhood such as Jam and Jackplug &amp; the Sockets, playing cover songs by the Rolling Stones and the Beatles. Ash initially tried unsuccessfully to convince his school friend Peter Murphy to join him in a band. According to Ash: &quot;Pete didn&#x27;t think about it at all, it wasn&#x27;t on his mind as such.&quot; Ash&#x27;s band the Craze performed several times around Northampton in 1978. When the Craze dissolved, Ash once again tried to convince Murphy to join him, simply because Ash thought that Murphy had the right look for a band. Murphy, who was working in a printing factory, agreed to try it, although he had never written any lyrics or music. During their first rehearsal, Murphy cowrote the song &quot;In the Flat Field&quot;.

Ash&#x27;s old bandmate Kevin Haskins joined as the drummer. Ash intentionally avoided inviting David J, the driving force in their previous bands, because he wanted a band that he could control. Instead, Chris Barber was recruited to play bass, and together the four musicians formed the band S.R. However, within a few weeks, Ash relented and replaced Barber with David J, who suggested the new name of Bauhaus 1919. David J had already agreed to tour American airbases with another band but decided that joining his friends&#x27; group was &quot;the right thing to do&quot;. With their lineup complete, the band played their first gig at the now demolished Cromwell pub in Wellingborough on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1978.

The band had chosen the name Bauhaus 1919, a reference to the German Bauhaus art movement of the 1920s, because of its &quot;stylistic implications and associations&quot;, according to David J. The band also chose the same typeface used on the Bauhaus college building in Dessau, Germany, as well as the Bauhaus emblem, designed by Oskar Schlemmer. Bauhaus associate Graham Bentley said that the group was unlike any Northampton band of the time, most of whom played predominantly cover songs. Bentley videotaped a performance by the group, which was sent to several record labels, in the hope of obtaining a contract. This approach was hindered partly because many record companies did not have home-video equipment, so the group opted to record a demo.

===&quot;Bela Lugosi&#x27;s Dead&quot; and 4AD===
====&quot;Bela Lugosi&#x27;s Dead&quot;====

After only six weeks as a band, Bauhaus entered the studio for the first time, meeting at Beck Studios in Wellingborough to record a demo. In rehearsal, the band experimented with echo and delay effects on the drums. The first of five tracks recorded during the session, &quot;Bela Lugosi&#x27;s Dead&quot;, exceeded nine minutes in length but was released as the group&#x27;s debut single in August 1979 on Small Wonder Records. The band was listed simply as Bauhaus, with the &quot;1919&quot; abandoned.

&quot;Bela Lugosi&#x27;s Dead&quot; was strongly influenced by the band&#x27;s interest in reggae and dub, styles in which the bass and the drums play prominent roles. The recording was completed on the first take. It was also the first time that Murphy had sung into a studio microphone, although he was sick with a cold when he recorded the song. Kevin Haskins&#x27; drumbeat was based on a bossa nova style. Daniel Ash explained the inception of the song: &quot;I was talking to David (J, bass) on the blower one night and told him I had this riff, using these trick chords that had a very haunting quality to it. He went: &#x27;It&#x27;s so weird you should say that because I&#x27;ve got these lyrics about Bela Lugosi, the actor who played a vampire. David J further elaborated: &quot;There was a season of old horror films on radio, and I was telling Daniel about how much I loved them. The one that had been on the night before was Dracula [1931]. I was saying how Bela Lugosi was the quintessential Dracula, the elegant depiction of the character.&quot; Ash elaborated about the chords: &quot;My riff has these mutant chords – they&#x27;re not even minor chords – but it&#x27;s rooted in an old Gary Glitter song, slowed right down. I didn&#x27;t realize that when I was doing it.&quot; Ash also explained how he was able to achieve the echo effects for the song: &quot;...David had this old HH echo unit, which would crap out on you all the time. We hooked up the guitar and snare drum to this echo unit and I was just sliding the HH amp thing to trigger all these echoes as the song went through.&quot; David J explained the song&#x27;s recording process: &quot;We didn&#x27;t really talk about what we were doing. Daniel started scratching away on the guitar, Kevin started his rhythm and there was this atmosphere building. I came in with those descending chords and Peter was just prowling up and down, slowly, like a big cat.&quot;
Murphy explained: &quot;We&#x27;d been talking about the erotic quality of vampire movies, even if they were the Hammer horror type. There was this conversation about the sexuality and eroticism of Dracula. Danny talked about his fascination with this and the occult connotations. So, we carried on that conversation and made it into a song.&quot; Murphy also elaborated: &quot;There&#x27;s an erotic, alluring element to the vampire. We didn&#x27;t want to write an ode to Bela Lugosi, ostensibly. The kitsch element was his name because he was the biggest icon, yet he was the most unlikely vampire-looking person. So there was that Brit angle to it, but it wasn&#x27;t at all negative. It was perfect. The idea of Bela Lugosi being dead or undead is classic.&quot; The band was initially nervous about the song&#x27;s excessive length, as it had caused several record labels to decline to issue the single. Haskins explained: &quot;Danny took an acetate around all the big companies–Virgin, EMI and the rest–and they all said similar things: &#x27;This is the sort of thing I listen to at home, but it&#x27;s not commercial.&#x27; Or: &#x27;It&#x27;s way too long. Can you edit it down to three minutes?&#x27; Even Beggars Banquet turned us down, which is ironic because we ended up on that label.&quot; However, Peter Stennet of Small Wonder Records agreed to release the single, favorably comparing it to the Velvet Underground&#x27;s single &quot;Sister Ray&quot;.

The single received a positive review in &quot;Sounds&quot; and stayed on the British independent charts for two years. It received crucial airplay on BBC Radio 1 and DJ John Peel&#x27;s evening show. The band recorded a session for Peel&#x27;s show, which was broadcast on 3 January 1980. Murphy recalled the session: &quot;We walked up to reception, passing Motörhead on their way out, and said, &#x27;Hello, we&#x27;re Bauhaus and we&#x27;re friends of John Peel. We&#x27;d like to go up please.&#x27; Somehow, we were allowed up there and we put the record in front of him. After we&#x27;d all introduced ourselves, he said on air, &#x27;We&#x27;ve got Bauhaus in the studio, they&#x27;re from Northampton and they have a new single out called &#x27;Bela Lugosi&#x27;s Dead&#x27;. It&#x27;s nine and a half minutes long and this will probably be the first and last time I&#x27;ll play this.&#x27; Then we left and went down to listen to it in the car. Apparently, the BBC switchboard was jammed with listeners wanting him to play it again.&quot; Of the additional tracks, &quot;Classic Rock&quot; wrote that, &quot;The rest of the material finds a band fumbling for direction, even touching on ska.&quot;

====&quot;In the Flat Field&quot;====
Despite the success of their signature song, the band left Small Wonder Records because of its lack of support for touring stemming from budget issues. Stennet stated: &quot;The trouble is we just can&#x27;t afford to send the bands on tour or anything like that, and a group needs that sort of support.&quot; Signing with the 4AD label, Bauhaus released two more singles, &quot;Dark Entries&quot; in January 1980 and &quot;Terror Couple Kill Colonel&quot; in June 1980, before issuing their first album &quot;In the Flat Field&quot; in October 1980. The album&#x27;s cover image, selected by David J, is a photograph titled &quot;Homage to Purvis de Chavannes&quot; by Duane Michals, an image of a naked man blowing a horn instrument. &quot;NME&quot; reviewer Andy Gill described it as &quot;Gothick-Romantick pseudo-decadence&quot; and dismissed the band as &quot;a hip Black Sabbath&quot;. Despite negative reviews, &quot;In the Flat Field&quot; topped the indie charts and spent one week at No. 72 on the UK Albums Chart. Although the band was satisfied with the album, they later admitted that it had failed to capture everything that they had wanted and that its intensity level was too high, but it was &quot;the purest statement of what [we] were like then&quot;. 
In August 1980, the band traveled to North America to play four dates in cities such as Toronto, Chicago and New York. One of Bauhaus&#x27; first US shows was in a venue called Space Place in Chicago, Illinois in September 1980, booked by Jim Nash and Dannie Flesher, the owners of the independent record label Wax Trax! Records. The band returned to England in October 1980 for a 20-date tour in England and in Europe to promote their first album. In December 1980, Bauhaus released a cover version of &quot;Telegram Sam&quot;, originally a hit by glam-rock pioneers T. Rex, as a single.

===Beggars Banquet and breakup===
====&quot;Mask&quot;====
Bauhaus&#x27; growing success outstripped 4AD&#x27;s resources, so the band moved to 4AD&#x27;s parent label, Beggars Banquet Records. Bauhaus released &quot;Kick in the Eye&quot; in March 1981 as its debut release on the label. The single reached No. 59 on the charts. The following single, &quot;The Passion of Lovers&quot;, peaked at No. 56 in July 1981. Murphy said, &quot;One of our loves is to make each single totally different from the last, not to be tied down by a style or sound.&quot; Bauhaus released their second album, &quot;Mask&quot;, in October 1981. The band employed more keyboards, and a variety of other instruments, to add to the diversity of the record. The front and back cover of the album was an impressionistic drawing created by Ash. In an unconventional move, the group shot a video for the album&#x27;s title track as a promotional tool for the band, rather than any specific song from the record, filmed in a hazardous and abandoned Victorian shoe factory in Northampton. David J explained the techniques, effects and his reaction regarding the content of the title track: &quot;I can still recall with crystal clarity overdubbing the echoed bass part and using a metal bottleneck to achieve the cascade effect that comes in at the point where Daniel&#x27;s acoustic twelve-string part starts. Hearing these sounds in ultra-sharp coke-intensified focus through headphones produced an ecstatic heart-bursting emotion on the edge of orgasmic release.&quot; The film crew consists of Chris Collins and Ken Lawrence of Standard Pictures. The video was made with a minuscule budget; the gear used in the video were powered off car batteries and roll film, and filmed in a hazardous and abandoned Victorian shoe factory in Northampton, which was just across the road from the main police station. David J explains how the band and film crew broke into the building to make the video: &quot;We snuck into this place about three in the morning and the lights kept going down at crucial moments so we&#x27;d have to wait and sit around in complete darkness...the place was dripping wet although it all added to the atmosphere.&quot; The video&#x27;s imagery and lighting borrowed heavily from German Expressionism. David J commented on the content of the music video: &quot;We improvised around the loose idea of a ritualistic resurrection, with Peter lain out like a corpse on a wooden slab. Each of us would administer some kind of shamanistic voodoo to assist in the raising of the dead. The place was freezing cold, dank, and dripping with filthy water. The lights kept going out, and we would be plunged into complete darkness until they were restored.&quot; When the scenes of the factory were finished, the group went to another location for filming. David J explained: &quot;Once we had filmed the scenes in the factory, we set off for a second location: the woods on the grounds of the Spencer family&#x27;s country estate – another illegal situation, and a potential threat to the monarchy. We did have fun that night! The finished film looked great: a fog-cloaked atmospheric drama that was redolent of a German Expressionist silent horror flick.&quot; David J also mentioned that the music video was more of an art piece than a traditional music video and commented that Chris Collins &quot;did a brilliant job of capturing the visual essence of the band.&quot; Chris Collins commented on the motive of the video: &quot;Foremost in our minds was to make something interesting, so somebody who&#x27;d never heard of Bauhaus before and suddenly saw that video might say, &quot;God, that&#x27;s really interesting, I want to know more about that&quot;. Ken Lawrence also explained the film&#x27;s intention: &quot;Every film about a band should show the strengths of that artist. So of course &quot;Mask&quot; is a promo because hopefully, it&#x27;s what Bauhaus are about. If you listen to their lyrics at all, if you know the way their music is structured – it&#x27;s thought provoking, it evokes mood and it&#x27;s very atmospheric music and that was our approach to making the film.&quot; It made only one appearance on British TV.

Around the same time, &quot;In keeping with our surrealist leaning...&quot;, the band also employed the &quot;exquisite corpse&quot; technique to an experimental film they made called &quot;Consequences&quot;, where each member was given an amount of time to film whatever they wished. It was shown on tour in place of a support band. The band toured broadly to promote the album by playing a 16-date tour of England and 13 dates in Europe.

====&quot;Spirit&quot; and &quot;The Sky&#x27;s Gone Out&quot;====

In July 1982, Bauhaus released the single &quot;Spirit&quot;, produced by Hugh Jones. This was unusual for the band because they typically produced their own music. Conflicts and compromises subsequently occurred in the studio. David J explained: &quot;It took ages and ages. Usually we recorded very quickly–we&#x27;d do an album in three weeks from start to finish–but that took about nine days, which for us was absurd. There was so much agonising over it more from the producer than us.&quot; The song used an acoustic guitar with a bossa nova drumbeat. According to Shirley, the song was about &quot;...a &#x27;fifth member&#x27; of the band–a spirit they felt occupied the stage, lifting them to a higher plane when they were playing well.&quot; The music video was originally intended to show a physical representation of the spirit, including &quot;a single dancer with a white face mask and body paint who would come onto the stage whilst the band performed the song and literally &#x27;lift&#x27; Peter and give him wings.&quot; However, the producers changed the spirit to a spectral female figure &quot;who would walk through the theatre along with a motley crew of clowns and jugglers.&quot; When the band returned from their tour of the United States, they disliked the music video and wanted to redo it. The record label refused, unwilling to provide more money for it, but the band insisted on changing the video. David J explained: &quot;So we raised the money ourselves out of our own bank balances and pooled our money and so we went in and re-edited it, trying to get it into some kind of shape. We did it. Delivered the master to Beggars Banquet. Next week–this was at the time of the video jukebox craze–we went into a pub and we see the original horrible version on the video. So we immediately rang Beggars Banquet and said; &#x27;What&#x27;s going on?&#x27; and they&#x27;d send out the wrong one and it had gone off to TV and everything.&quot; The single was intended to break into the Top 30 but only reached No. 42. The band was displeased with the single and rerecorded it in 1982 for their third album, &quot;The Sky&#x27;s Gone Out&quot;. Nico made a guest appearance when the band played a gig in Salford University for a cover performance of the Velvet Underground song, &quot;I&#x27;m Waiting for the Man&quot;.

The band wanted to produce their third LP, &quot;The Sky&#x27;s Gone Out&quot;, themselves, but arguments ensued in the studio among the band members over creative direction. The band members realised that they needed an objective perspective on their music, and producer Derek Tompkins was hired. Tompkins commented: &quot;I was, however, quite willing to act as an engineer provided the resident engineer was responsible for the engineering and I was only responsible for interpreting what they wanted to him and helping a bit creatively myself.&quot;

The band were booked into Rockfield Studios in Wales for one month to record the album but had little original material written beforehand. Murphy explained: &quot;The third LP was one of those unwritten albums that was done on the spot. An album of experimentation which was enjoyable to us because we didn&#x27;t have any songs and we didn&#x27;t feel like writing stuff and we said, &quot;OK that&#x27;s fine. If we don&#x27;t have any songs we&#x27;ll make the songwriting environment the studio.&quot; Although the sessions were successful, conflicts arose between the band and engineer, with Tompkins as the mediator. Although Tompkins did not understand the album&#x27;s music or lyrics, he &quot;always used to ask them what the song was about so I knew what mood I was aiming for&quot;. Some of the lyrics reflected the band&#x27;s personal feelings and experiences, such as &quot;All We Ever Wanted Was Everything&quot;. According to David J, the song &quot;evokes nostalgic memories of a time of innocence and naive yearning.&quot; David J praised Murphy&#x27;s vocals on the song as &quot;emoting the bittersweet sentiment so perfectly, every word ringing true.&quot;

That same year, Bauhaus scored their greatest hit with a cover of David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot;, which was recorded during a BBC session. The song was chosen by the band in response to critics who had accused them of copying Bowie&#x27;s sound. Ash explained: &quot;[W]e thought we&#x27;d do the opposite of what they&#x27;d expect and promptly release &#x27;Ziggy&#x27;.&quot; The song reached No. 15 on the British charts and earned the band an appearance on the television show &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. &quot;The Sky&#x27;s Gone Out&quot; also became the band&#x27;s greatest album success, peaking at No. 3. That same year, Bauhaus appeared in the horror film &quot;The Hunger&quot;, performing &quot;Bela Lugosi&#x27;s Dead&quot; during the opening credits. The final cut of the scene focused on Murphy; this, coupled with his modelling work in a popular ad campaign for Maxell, caused resentment among his bandmates.

====&quot;Burning from the Inside&quot;====

Prior to the recording of their fourth album, &quot;Burning from the Inside&quot; (1983), Murphy was stricken with pneumonia, which prevented him from contributing much to the album. Ash and David assumed control of the album and performed lead vocals on several tracks. The album&#x27;s song &quot;Who Killed Mister Moonlight&quot; was described by David J as a &quot;surrealistic ballad inspired in part by the murder of John Lennon&quot;. Also, the mysterious character of Mister Moonlight had a symbolic meaning, which was seen by the band &quot;as being representative of the dreamy, poetic aspect of Bauhaus&quot;. The album&#x27;s lead single &quot;She&#x27;s in Parties&quot; reached No. 26 on the charts and earned Bauhaus their third and final &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; appearance. Bauhaus then embarked on an international promotional tour for the album, with dates in Europe and the Far East. On the night before they were supposed to perform two shows at Hammersmith Palais in London, the group decided to disband.

The band played their farewell show on 5 July 1983 at the Hammersmith Palais. Fans had been warned by the band&#x27;s crew to not miss the show, without telling them it was the last. After a long encore, consisting of some of their early songs, David J left the stage with the words &quot;rest in peace&quot;. &quot;Burning from the Inside&quot; was released one week later. The album received largely positive reviews and reached No. 13 on the charts. Bauhaus released the single &quot;Sanity Assassin&quot; in limited quantities as a farewell gift to their fan-club members.

=== Post-Bauhaus careers and solo projects ===
During the band&#x27;s initial lifecycle, solo projects would be initiated at times. In 1981, while still a member of Bauhaus, David J started a solo project with Rene Halkett, an original student of the Bauhaus art school. This correspondence came about due to Halkett&#x27;s younger neighbor telling him of hearing about a group called Bauhaus on the John Peel Show on BBC radio. This intrigued Halkett and he soon wrote to Peel about getting in touch with the band. They eventually met, discussed poetry and decided to send David a cassette tape that contained Halkett reciting two of his poems, in hopes of enticing David to collaborate with him. After listening intensely to the tape, David decided to go to a recording studio where he created backing music for the tape. This collaboration resulted in a single called &quot;Armour/Nothing&quot; which was released by 4AD. According to David J regarding the correspondence, &quot;He wrote to John Peel when he was playing Bauhaus&#x27; first record, &#x27;Bela Lugosi&#x27;s Dead&#x27;, and Rene was then in his 70s and was an avid listener to John Peel&#x27;s show. He heard this and was intrigued that this band of young upstarts had usurped the name Bauhaus and he wrote to John Peel asking for more information. Peel sent me the letter and I was just amazed to be in contact with somebody from that time, so I wrote to Rene and we struck up this correspondence and in the end would meet up and I&#x27;d go down and visit him in his little cottage in Cornwall. We ended up making a record together, which was his poetry that I put to music. It was one of the first releases on 4AD. I would just go down and he would enthrall me with these stories of him appearing in these cabaret clubs in Weimar and dancing on the piano and letting off revolvers in the club and this whole sort of barbarous cabaret scene that he was intrinsically involved in. He met Bertolt Brecht and people like that, the surrealists came through and his teachers were Kandinsky and it was just amazing to have a friend from that time so that gave me a real insight, to actually be communicating with somebody that was there.&quot; Halkett commented on his contribution to the single: &quot;I felt that the two poems required something more than print because they depend on things which can only be expressed in musical signs... It (the single) falls between music and poetry and is not entirely either. With &quot;Nothing&quot;, David has written a perfect arrangement for what is a quite concentrated philosophical idea and it becomes so much more than the words...&quot; 

After Bauhaus disbanded, the members of the band began solo work. Murphy worked briefly with bassist Mick Karn of Japan in the band Dalis Car before embarking on a solo career with albums such as &quot;Should the World Fail to Fall Apart&quot; (1986), &quot;Love Hysteria&quot; (1988) and &quot;Deep&quot; (1989). Ash had already started Tones on Tail with Bauhaus roadie Glen Campling as a side project in 1982. After Bauhaus disbanded, Kevin Haskins joined the group and the trio released an album and several EPs but disbanded after a 1984 American tour. During this time, David J released two solo albums and collaborated with other musicians, recording two albums with the Jazz Butcher, and also with comics writer/spoken-word artist Alan Moore in the short-lived band the Sinister Ducks.

The former members of Bauhaus planned to reform and arranged a rehearsal, but Murphy failed to appear on the scheduled day. However, the other three band members rehearsed and were inspired by the chemistry that they developed as a trio, leading to the formation of Love and Rockets in 1985. Love and Rockets released several highly acclaimed albums and penetrated the American charts with &quot;So Alive&quot; in 1989. The band dissolved in 1999, briefly reunited for a festival tour in 2009 and then reunited in 2023. Both Ash and David J released solo albums during the Love and Rockets years, and Murphy contributed backing vocals to David J&#x27;s 1992 single &quot;Candy on the Cross&quot;.

=== Subsequent developments: reunions and a final album ===

Bauhaus reunited for the Resurrection Tour in 1998. Their stage show opened with &quot;Double Dare&quot; and Murphy singing to the audience on a television screen. The tour featured a new song, &quot;The Dog&#x27;s a Vapour&quot;, which was also included in the &quot;Heavy Metal 2000&quot; film soundtrack. A live album was recorded during the tour, &quot;Gotham&quot;, which was released the following year. It included a studio recording of Bauhaus&#x27; cover of the Dead Can Dance song &quot;Severance&quot;.

Bauhaus reunited again in 2005, playing the Coachella Festival in Indio, California. Their set opened with Murphy being lowered upside-down to the stage while singing &quot;Bela Lugosi&#x27;s Dead&quot;. Following Murphy&#x27;s 2005 tour, Bauhaus embarked on a full tour beginning in North America in Autumn 2005 and ending in Europe in February 2006. During the tour, Bauhaus covered Joy Division&#x27;s &quot;Transmission&quot;. The band also mentioned that they hoped to record new music. In May, they performed as the opening act during Nine Inch Nails&#x27; American tour.

In 2008, Bauhaus released their first new studio album since 1983, &quot;Go Away White&quot;, on the Cooking Vinyl label. However, it marked the band&#x27;s end, and the album had no promotional tour. Haskins later said: &quot;We were getting along really well, but there was an incident that occurred ... Some of us just felt that we didn&#x27;t want to carry on as a working unit.&quot; In early 2008, Murphy claimed that he &quot;was most satisfied with the bonding on an emotional level. It was good to be working together and to put the past behind us and it was very positive. The result was coming out really fast, so it was exciting and it was very enjoyable&quot;, but in the end, &quot;that rocky character worked and I think it was a bit right to finish it, really&quot;. David J commented on the breakup: &quot;You have a test tube, and you pour in one chemical, and you pour in another chemical, and something happens. It starts to bubble. Pour in another chemical, and it starts to bubble a bit more. You pour in a fourth chemical, and it bubbles really violently, and then explodes. That&#x27;s my answer&quot;.

In 2017, Ash and Haskins toured as Poptone with Haskins&#x27; daughter Diva Dompe on bass. The group performed songs by Bauhaus, Tones on Tail and Love and Rockets, along with cover songs. A live album recorded at various stops on the tour was released through PledgeMusic.

In 2018, Murphy and David J announced a tour of New Zealand, Australia and Europe to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Bauhaus, performing &quot;In the Flat Field&quot; in its entirety.

In September 2019, after a 13-year hiatus, Bauhaus announced a show at the 4,000-seat Hollywood Palladium with all original members on 3 November. A second show was added for the following night after all tickets for the first show sold quickly. A third date at the same venue was confirmed for 1 December.

In March 2022, Bauhaus released their first new song in 14 years with &quot;Drink the New Wine&quot;, which was recorded separately by all four members during the COVID-19 lockdown. The recording process used the exquisite corpse method whereby each artist adds to the piece without hearing what the others have done.

Bauhaus toured Europe and the West Coast of the United States in 2022. The band was due to tour the East Coast of the United States, but the tour was cancelled on 31 August as Murphy announced that he was entering rehab. On 19 April 2023, Ash confirmed that the Bauhaus reunion had ended, and the remaining remembers reformed Love and Rockets.

== Musical style and influences ==
===Influences===


According to David J, the bands Bauhaus related to in the post-punk scene were Joy Division, Pere Ubu, Devo, Gang of Four, Cabaret Voltaire, and the Pop Group. Among bands and singers who influenced Bauhaus, they cited Siouxsie and the Banshees, David Bowie, T-Rex, Roxy Music, Syd Barrett&#x27;s Pink Floyd, New York Dolls, Velvet Underground, Iggy Pop and the Stooges, the Doors, Alice Cooper, MC5, Ramones, the Sex Pistols, the Clash, the Residents, Captain Beefheart, Suicide, Kraftwerk, Neu!, Can, Faust, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Who, Bob Dylan, Tom Waits, Serge Gainsbourg, Lee Scratch Perry, King Tubby, Mikey Dread, Kurt Weill, Scott Walker, and Jacques Brel. Specific recordings that were influential on the band include the compilation album , Lou Reed&#x27;s albums Berlin and Transformer, the Bits and Pieces single by the Dave Clark Five and the Double Barrel single by Dave and Ansell Collins.

In terms of early influences from childhood, David J said that he was interested in jazz and its musicians such as Miles Davis, Charlie Parker and Thelonious Monk. He has also listed Television&#x27;s Marquee Moon as one of his all-time favorite albums. Peter Murphy cited Doris Day, Simon and Garfunkel, the Beatles, the Everly Brothers and his experiences from Mass in Catholic school as highly influential to his singing. He mentioned that the first 7-inch single he ever bought was &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; by the Beatles and also listed Brian Eno&#x27;s Music for Airports as one of his favorite albums. Daniel Ash was interested in music at a young age, first being impressed by the stomping of the Dave Clark Five&#x27;s &quot;Bits and Pieces&quot; song and later going through his older brother&#x27;s music collection of records from the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Faces and the Kinks. The first record he bought was Dave and Ansell Collins&#x27; &quot;Double Barrel&quot;. When Ash was asked about how he developed his playing style and guitar influences, he replied: &quot;My style of playing comes from a mixture of extreme laziness to learn proper scales/chords and a burning desire to sound original and new. Although I am a huge fan of Hendrix and Mick Ronson, Robert Fripp on Bowie tracks is also fab, and what about Earl Slick!&quot; Ash also mentioned his appreciation of bands such as the Only Ones, the Damned, Television, Richard Hell and the Voidoids and said that the Stooges&#x27; &quot;Raw Power&quot; as one of his all-time favorite records. Kevin Haskins at 14 years old went to see Led Zeppelin and the drummer&#x27;s (John Bonham) drum solo impressed him and called it &quot;amazing&quot;. However at the same time, he was depressed as well due to feeling inadequate about his own musical abilities and never reaching the skill of Bonham. He even had thoughts of giving up music altogether. However, the nascent punk scene and seeing bands such as the Sex Pistols and the Clash gave him the confidence he needed to pursue in music.

Around 1970, David J&#x27;s was intrigued by the ska music, Roots reggae and dub music coming out of Jamaica. He mentioned that reggae &quot;...was the first music that I was seriously into.&quot; It was from this exposure from these musical styles that made David J choose a bass guitar instead of a lead guitar. David explained: &quot;I loved [Dub]. It was so exciting because it was my first exposure to this other world really. Something subterranean, dark, sexually charged, violent and compelling. This dark music was played in these dark places and was just captivating. I realised very quickly that what was powerful about this sound was the bass. I recalled that when we got guitars, no-one wanted to be the bass player – we had various bands just a bunch of friends who wanted to play pop music and they all wanted to play lead guitar – so I went; &#x27;Well, I&#x27;ll play the bass&#x27;. I retained my six string guitar and just played the bottom four strings and just used to play along with the records and work out the bass lines. I just got into it and found it really satisfying and saved up and bought a bass guitar.&quot;

Given their mixture of reggae and punk rock, Murphy said that musically, they were &quot;more aligned to the Clash than anything else that was going around.&quot; When asked about the influence of reggae on Bauhaus&#x27; music, Murphy stated that it was &quot;massive. We were listening to toasting music all the time, and David brought in a lot of bass lines that were very lead riffs [...] those bass lines really formed the basis of the music&quot; In particular, dub reggae was highly influential to the band, so far that David J mentioned that their signature song, &quot;Bela Lugosi&#x27;s Dead&quot;, was intended as dub.

The band members Daniel, David and Kevin once attended a Rastafarian event that became quite influential to their music. As David explained: &quot;At the time, Northampton had a large Rastafarian population, centred around the Matta Fancanta Youth Movement, which had its base at the old Salvation Army Citadel on the corner of Sheep Street, just across from Derngate Bus Station. It was run by Trevor Hall, whose uncle had started the famed Count Shelly sound system, which Trevor inherited. They would hold monthly events featuring two outfits competing against each other, spinning dub plates—instrumental tracks direct from Jamaica—and blasting them over the huge speakers while their respective &#x27;toasters&#x27; took turns freestyling over the top. They would really go to town, painting up the entire place in the red, green, and gold of the Ethiopian flag and wearing suits and outsized hats to match, while the women would dye their hair. There were quotations from Haile Selassie all around the walls, and the air was thick with ganja smoke and the gamey aroma of goat&#x27;s head soup. It was a true &#x27;temporary autonomous zone&#x27;, to quote the anarchist writer and poet Hakim Bey, and the police would wisely keep their distance. Daniel, Kevin, and I would be the only white faces in the throng, but there was never any trouble—quite the opposite—and the amazing music that we heard in that place became a big influence on us, &#x27;Bela Lugosi&#x27;s Dead&#x27; being a good example.&quot;

The band&#x27;s other musical influences included various forms of rock (garage, glam, art, electronic, prog, psychedelic, heavy metal, folk, experimental, krautrock), as well as avant-garde music, ambient music, traditional pop, disco and funk. Outside of music, Bauhaus&#x27;s influences were often artistic and literary and included William S. Burroughs, Brion Gysin, Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, Bertolt Brecht, Arthur Rimbaud, Charles Baudelaire, Comte de Lautréamont, Jean Cocteau, André Breton, Surrealism, German Expressionism, Greek Mythology, Ingmar Bergman, David Lynch, Oscar Wilde, Franz Kafka and Antonin Artaud. In regards to the influence of the original Bauhaus movement on the band, Murphy stated that &quot;Bauhaus had no influence on Bauhaus (the band) except for being the sound, shape, energetic, and sensory birth name of our group.&quot;

===Sound===
Bauhaus combined these influences to create a gloomy, earnest and introspective version of post-punk, which appealed to many music fans who felt disillusioned in the wake of punk&#x27;s collapse. Its crucial elements included Murphy&#x27;s deep and sonorous voice, Ash&#x27;s jagged guitar playing and David J&#x27;s dub-influenced bass. Their sound and gloomy style would eventually come to be known as gothic rock or simply &quot;goth&quot;.

According to David J, the band were &quot;...always keen not to be a traditional &#x27;rock&#x27; band, and we would go to great pains to avoid that well-trodden road.&quot; They experimented with various techniques and methods for song composition such as the Exquisite corpse on tracks such as &quot;1. David Jay 2. Peter Murphy 3. Kevin Haskins 4. Daniel Ash&quot; along with the use of Brian Eno&#x27;s Oblique Strategies cards. To achieve some of the sound effects in their songs, various instruments were implemented such as bottlenecks, echo units and a Syndrum.

In their second album &quot;Mask&quot;, expanded their sound with the addition of synthesizers, electronics and a saxophone to &quot;add color and dynamics to each song.&quot; The album was less structured and spontaneous compared to their first album. The song &quot;Of Lillies and Remains&quot; is an example of this method. According to Murphy: &quot;&quot;Of Lillies and Remains&quot; is a song that was written as it happened. None of it was rehearsed, worked out or played beforehand. We simply told the engineer to turn on the tape. That was incredibly exciting. That said a lot for our confidence and courage and total absurdity; that it was possible to demonstrate that those ideas form an artistic point of view, come from another outside force – i.e. the collective creative thing.&quot; In an interview with John Robb, Ash mentioned that he bought an EBow in 1981.

===Lyrics===
In their first album and singles, Bauhaus&#x27; songs dealt with taboo subjects such as martyrdom, paranoia, madness, obsession and prostitution. For example, the song &quot;Stigmata Martyr&quot; was about (according to Shirley) &quot;...a person whose religious obsession with Christ takes the form of a physical manifestation of the crucifixion; i.e. nail marks on the hands: &quot;In a crucifixion, ecstacy, Lying cross checked in agony, Stigmata bleed continuously, Holes in head, hands, feet, and weep for me.&quot; When delivering these lyrics Peter became the stigmata.&quot; Murphy also commented on the misconceptions of the lyrics of the song: &quot;I don&#x27;t think the other members of the band really got what I was writing about, and the collective intention suddenly became very anti-religious. And that song is not an anti-religious song at all. The message is, really, the dangers of obsession, of almost psychosomatic induction of that masochism. That alone can be an illusion. And it&#x27;s way off the mark as to the actual source of the message of any religious God. God doesn&#x27;t want you to be in pain and die. It wasn&#x27;t anti-religious. It wasn&#x27;t demonic. It was alluding to the manifestation. Is it truly a mark of the Holy Ghost or is it simply an obsession condition? That&#x27;s all there is to it.&quot; Another song, &quot;Dark Entries&quot; tells the story of title character Dorian Gray from Oscar Wilde&#x27;s novel &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot;, which is Murphy&#x27;s favorite novel. Murphy explains: &quot;It was the first book with real substance that I chose for myself. It&#x27;s a story of great narcissism and esoteric interior, and brilliantly written. It&#x27;s a window into this personality, this Oscar Wilde chap I&#x27;d heard about. The language is so opulent. It&#x27;s a rock star&#x27;s story, really.&quot; The song &quot;A God In An Alcove&quot; was about &quot;...the story of a fallen idol.&quot; The title track&#x27;s &quot;In the Flat Field&quot; was inspired by &quot;...the quotidian mundaneness of life in Northampton, and the desire to escape that &#x27;flat&#x27; existence.&quot;

Other songs from later albums and singles, explored subjects such as nostalgia, desire, reflection, self-realization and hope. For example, the song &quot;All We Ever Wanted Was Everything&quot; was about the &quot;...nostalgic memories of a time of innocence and naive yearning.&quot; Also, some of the song titles came from literary sources. For example, the song title &quot;Kick in the Eye&quot; was based on a line from the novel &quot;Satori in Paris&quot; by Jack Kerouac.

The construction of their lyrics were inspired by the Cut-up technique method. An example of their approach to lyric structure is the amalgamation of individual lyrics from each member in the song &quot;Of Lillies and Remains&quot;, as Murphy explained: &quot;I&#x27;d written a dream out on a piece of paper and Dave picked up this piece of paper at random and found a blank side and wrote out a lyric. He turned it over and asked what it was. I said, &quot;It&#x27;s a dream.&quot; And so he said: &quot;Let&#x27;s do this.&quot; So David went in to do his half – no rehearsal – and then I took it from where he left off. That was a typical way of working.&quot;

===Live performances===
In terms of live performances, Bauhaus&#x27; stage theatrics, specifically their lighting, was inspired by a Judas Priest concert that Murphy attended with Bauhaus&#x27; manager. They predominantly used black and white lighting for their live shows. When they were asked why in early interviews, David J responded, &quot;...coloured lights are for Christmas trees.&quot; Their lighting was so minimal that sometimes the band would play in almost complete darkness where they were glimpsed rather than seen in their shows. Their manager Graham Bentley helped with the lighting, &quot;I started doing lights for Bauhaus – which obviously came about because I was the person who was there – I got into it very much from the start. I love the shadows. I used to call it a dark show rather than a light show. The essential emphasis was less light.&quot; Bentley used industrial lights for the lighting and put the lights on the floor rather than the ceiling. Also, a strobe light would be used for Murphy to hold on to his body and move around with it on stage.

== Legacy and influence ==
Bauhaus are frequently considered to be the inventors of goth; however, the band rejected this label, preferring to describe their style as &quot;dark glam&quot;. Peter Murphy said he felt their contemporaries had a larger hand in solidifying what became goth. Likewise, Kevin Haskins felt that bands such as Siouxsie and the Banshees were more influential to goth subculture than themselves and mentioned that Bauhaus were &quot;...more three dimensional, more art rock&quot;. Ash nevertheless admitted: &quot;if you wear black and your first single is &quot;Bela Lugosi&#x27;s Dead&quot;, you&#x27;ve pretty much got a stamp on you. That&#x27;s always been one of our strongest songs, so it&#x27;s sort of undeniable&quot;.

Various bands and artists with goth associations pointed to Bauhaus as an inspiration, including Type O Negative, Alien Sex Fiend, Zola Jesus, Deine Lakaien, AFI, Buck-Tick, Lycia, Jaz Coleman (of Killing Joke), the Cult, Glenn Danzig (of Misfits), Greg Mackintosh (of Paradise Lost), She Wants Revenge, the Dresden Dolls, Soul Merchants, She Past Away and Wolfsheim. The Mission&#x27;s Wayne Hussey even sang with Murphy on stage in 2013. Bauhaus were also influential upon many industrial rock groups and artists, like Ministry, Marilyn Manson, Nine Inch Nails, Nitzer Ebb, and Skinny Puppy.

In addition, Bauhaus were hailed by various alternative/indie rock performers and groups, including the Flaming Lips, Steve Albini (of Big Black), Jehnny Beth of Savages, Stephen Malkmus (of Pavement), Alan Sparhawk (of Low), Bradford Cox (of Deerhunter), Mark Lanegan (of Screaming Trees), Jesse Hughes (of the Eagles of Death Metal), Courtney Taylor-Taylor (of the Dandy Warhols), Jeff Ament (of Pearl Jam), Alex Henry Foster (of Your Favorite Enemies), Nicholas Thorburn (of Islands), Matt Noveskey (of Blue October), Jane&#x27;s Addiction, Soundgarden, the Smashing Pumpkins, A Neon Rome, ...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead, Hole, whose lead singer Courtney Love admitted that a lot of her songs are &quot;complete Bauhaus rip-offs&quot;, Interpol, My Chemical Romance, the Twilight Sad, Shearwater, and Elliott Smith.

The group have been namechecked by several other prominent musical acts from other genres, including Jello Biafra (of the Dead Kennedys), Jonathan Davis (of Korn), the extreme metal band Celtic Frost, the lo-fi musician Ariel Pink, Maynard James Keenan (from Tool), electronic act Carl Craig, American record producer DJ Premier (of Gang Starr), the American comedian/musician Reggie Watts, the Iranian musician Azam Ali, the Japanese Visual kei musician Hide (of X Japan), the Japanese post-rock Mono, the Japanese heavy metal band Dir En Grey, whose lead singer Kyo listed &quot;Press the Eject and Give Me the Tape&quot; as his top record he would take to a desert island, the electronica act Moby, the trip hop band Massive Attack, the crust punk band Amebix, the shoegaze band Drop Nineteens, the psychedelic rock band White Hills, the noise rock band Today Is the Day, the nu metal band Coal Chamber, the extreme metal band Behemoth, the grindcore band Napalm Death, Randy Blythe (of Lamb of God), Fred Durst (of Limp Bizkit), Serj Tankian (of System of a Down), Sean Yseult (of White Zombie), Bilinda Butcher (of My Bloody Valentine), Stuart Braithwaite (of Mogwai) Blink-182 namedropped Bauhaus on their song &quot;She&#x27;s Out of Her Mind&quot; on their &quot;California&quot; album. Duff McKagan of Guns N&#x27; Roses listed the Bauhaus compilation &quot;Bauhaus 1979–1983&quot; in his 100 favorite albums list.

Alternative Press included Bauhaus in their 1996 list of &quot;100 underground inspirations of the past 20 years.&quot;

The Bauhaus song &quot;All We Ever Wanted Was Everything&quot; (from &quot;The Sky&#x27;s Gone Out&quot;) was covered by several artists and bands, including John Frusciante (guitarist of the Red Hot Chili Peppers), MGMT and Xiu Xiu (who recorded it in 2006 for their &quot;Tu Mi Piaci&quot; EP). Billy Corgan of the Smashing Pumpkins sang T. Rex&#x27;s &quot;Telegram Sam&quot; and &quot;All We Ever Wanted Was Everything&quot; live on stage with Bauhaus in 1998. &quot;Double Dare&quot; was covered by the alternative rock band the God Machine. &quot;Hollow Hills&quot; was covered by System of a Down. &quot;Silent Hedges&quot; (along with &quot;Double Dare&quot;) was covered by the power metal band Nevermore.

&quot;Bela Lugosi&#x27;s Dead&quot;, was covered by numerous acts, including Until December (1986), the Electric Hellfire Club (1996), Opera IX (on 2000 album &quot;The Black Opera: Symphoniæ Mysteriorum in Laudem Tenebrarum&quot;), Sepultura (on 2001 album &quot;Nation&quot;), Nouvelle Vague (on 2006 album &quot;Bande à part&quot;), Chris Cornell (2007), Nine Inch Nails (2009), Trent Reznor with Murphy and TV on the Radio (2013), Massive Attack (2013), David J with Jill Tracy (2013), Chvrches (for the 2014 &quot;Vampire Academy&quot; soundtrack), Dead Cross (on their 2017 debut album), the Damned (2019). and A Plague On Both your Houses (covering both &quot;Bela Lugosi&#x27;s Dead&quot; and also a 2 part dub reggae version of &quot;She&#x27;s In Parties&quot; in 2023).

=== Cultural references ===
Bauhaus&#x27;s fanbase extends beyond music; the American novelist Chuck Palahniuk was influenced by the Bauhaus song &quot;Bela Lugosi&#x27;s Dead&quot; when writing his 2005 novel &quot;Haunted&quot;. In James O&#x27;Barr&#x27;s 1989 comic book &quot;The Crow&quot;, the facial features of Eric Draven were based on those of Peter Murphy. In Neil Gaiman&#x27;s series &quot;The Sandman&quot;, Dream&#x27;s face and appearance were also based on Murphy. Additionally, comic book writer Alan Moore wrote the sleeve notes of &quot;Mask&quot; and contributed an anonymous Bauhaus review called &quot;Phantoms of the Teenage Opera&quot; to the UK music paper &quot;Sounds&quot;.

The 1984 music video of the song &quot;You&#x27;re the Inspiration&quot; from the American band Chicago featured lead singer Peter Cetera wearing a Bauhaus T-shirt.

In an interview at the CBGB, Axl Rose from Guns N&#x27; Roses is seen wearing a Bauhaus T-shirt. In the &quot;Beavis and Butt-head&quot; season 3 episode &quot;Meet God, Part II&quot; (1993), they view and comment on a music video for Bauhaus&#x27; Bowie cover, &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot;. Susie Lewis, the co-creator of the American animated series &quot;Daria&quot;, is a fan of the band and used their song &quot;1. David Jay 2. Peter Murphy 3. Kevin Haskins 4. Daniel Ash&quot; in the closing credits of episode 213, &quot;Write Where it Hurts&quot;. In the 2003 &quot;South Park&quot; episode &quot;Raisins&quot;, Henrietta Biggle (one of the &quot;goth kids&quot;) had a bedroom poster of &quot;Blauhaus&quot;, a parody version of the band.

In the 2015–2016 &quot;American Horror Story&quot; season &quot;American Horror Story: Hotel&quot;, &quot;Bela Lugosi&#x27;s Dead&quot; is used in the opening episode, in line with the underlying horror/vampire theme of the series. In the 2017 &quot;The Americans&quot; episode &quot;Darkroom&quot;, the Bauhaus song &quot;Slice of Life&quot; is played in the background of the red room scene. It was ranked #8 in Vulture&#x27;s list of &quot;The 10 Best Musical Moments in The Americans&quot;. &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;″s recurring &quot;Goth Talk&quot; skit used &quot;Bela Lugosi&#x27;s Dead&quot; as its theme song.

The 2016 single &quot;She&#x27;s Out of Her Mind&quot; by American pop punk band Blink-182 describes a girl with &quot;a black shirt, black skirt and Bauhaus stuck in her mind&quot;.

Bauhaus&#x27; performance at Coachella in 2005 has been ranked #5 among &quot;LA Weekly&quot; as one of &quot;The 20 Best Coachella Sets of All Time&quot;.

Bauhaus&#x27; appearance in the Tony Scott film &quot;The Hunger&quot; has been ranked #20 by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; as &quot;The 30 Greatest Rock &amp; Roll Movie Moments&quot;. and #17 by Time Out as &quot;The 50 Best Uses of Songs in Movies&quot;.

Nielsen was born in Regina, Saskatchewan. After high school, he enlisted in the Royal Canadian Air Force in 1943 and served until the end of World War II. Upon his discharge, he worked as a disc jockey before receiving a scholarship to study theatre at the Neighborhood Playhouse. He made his acting debut in 1950, appearing in 46 live television programs a year. He made his film debut in 1956, with supporting roles in several dramas and western and romance films produced from the 1950s to 1970s.

Although his memorable performances in the films &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; and &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot; gave him standing as a serious actor, Nielsen later gained enduring recognition for his deadpan comedy roles during the 1980s, after being cast for the Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker comedy film &quot;Airplane!&quot; In his comedy roles, he specialized in portraying characters oblivious to and complicit in their absurd surroundings. His performance in &quot;Airplane!&quot; marked a turning point which made him &quot;the Olivier of spoofs&quot;, according to film critic Roger Ebert, and led to further success in the genre, starring in &quot;The Naked Gun&quot; film series, based on his earlier short-lived television series &quot;Police Squad!&quot;. He received a variety of awards and was inducted onto Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame and the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

==Early life==
Nielsen was born on February 11, 1926, in Regina, Saskatchewan. His mother, Mabel Elizabeth (&quot;&quot; Davies), was an immigrant from Wales, and his father, Ingvard Eversen Nielsen (1900–1975), was a Danish-born constable in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Nielsen was born the second of two boys to both his parents. His elder brother, Erik Nielsen (1924–2008), was a long-time Canadian Member of Parliament, cabinet minister, and Deputy Prime Minister of Canada from 1984 to 1986. He also has a half-brother, Gilbert Nielsen, from his father&#x27;s other relationship.

Nielsen&#x27;s half-uncle Jean Hersholt was an actor known for his portrayal of Dr. Christian in a radio series of that title, and the subsequent television series and films. In a 1994 &quot;Boston Globe&quot; article, he explained: &quot;I did learn very early that when I would mention my uncle, people would look at me as if I were the biggest liar in the world. Then I would take them home and show them 8-by-10 glossies, and things changed quite drastically. So I began to think that maybe this acting business was not a bad idea, much as I was very shy about it and certainly without courage regarding it. My uncle died not too long after I was in a position to know him. I regret that I had not a chance to know him better.&quot;

As a child, Nielsen and his family lived in Fort Norman (now Tulita) in the Northwest Territories, where his father was with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. They moved to Edmonton in 1930. His father was an abusive man who beat his wife and sons, and Leslie longed to escape. Following graduation from Victoria High School (later renamed Victoria School of the Arts) in Edmonton, he enlisted in the Royal Canadian Air Force at age 17 in 1943, though he was legally deaf (he wore hearing aids most of his life). There he trained as an aerial gunner during World War II. Upon the war&#x27;s end, he was discharged and worked briefly as a disc jockey at a Calgary, Alberta, radio station, before enrolling at the Lorne Greene Academy of Radio Arts in Toronto. 

While studying in Toronto, Nielsen received a scholarship to the Neighborhood Playhouse. He noted, &quot;I couldn&#x27;t refuse, but I must say when you come from the land of the snow goose, the moose, and wool to New York, you&#x27;re bringing every ton of hayseed and country bumpkin that you packed. As long as I didn&#x27;t open my mouth, I felt a certain security. But I always thought I was going to be unmasked: &#x27;OK, pack your stuff&#x27;. &#x27;Well, what&#x27;s the matter?&#x27;. &#x27;We&#x27;ve discovered you have no talent; we&#x27;re shipping you back to Canada&#x27;.&quot; 

He moved to New York City for his scholarship, studying theatre and music at the Neighborhood Playhouse, while performing in summer stock theatre. Afterward, he attended the Actors Studio, until his first television appearance in 1950 on an episode of &quot;Studio One&quot;, alongside Charlton Heston, for which he was paid $75 ().

==Career==

===Early career===

Nielsen&#x27;s career began in dramatic roles on television during &quot;Television&#x27;s Golden Age&quot;, appearing in 46 live programs in 1950 alone. He said there &quot;was very little gold, we only got $75 or $100 per show&quot;. He narrated documentaries and commercials and most of his early work as a dramatic actor was uneventful. Hal Erickson of Allmovie noted that &quot;much of Nielsen&#x27;s early work was undistinguished; he was merely a handsome leading man in an industry overstocked with handsome leading men&quot;. 

In 1956, he made his feature film debut in the Michael Curtiz-directed musical, &quot;The Vagabond King&quot;. In the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot;, Nielsen remembered Curtiz as &quot;a sadist, a charming sadist, but a sadist&quot;. Nielsen called this film &quot;The Vagabond Turkey&quot;. Though the film was not a success, producer Nicholas Nayfack offered him an audition for the science-fiction film &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot;, resulting in Nielsen&#x27;s taking a long contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM).
&quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; became an instant success, and roles in other MGM films such as &quot;Ransom!&quot; (1956), &quot;The Opposite Sex&quot; (1956) and &quot;Hot Summer Night&quot; (1957) followed. In 1957, Nielsen won the lead role opposite Debbie Reynolds in the romantic comedy &quot;Tammy and the Bachelor&quot; for Universal Pictures, which, as a &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; critic wrote in 1998, made people consider him a dramatic actor and handsome romantic lead. Dissatisfied with the films he was offered, calling the studios &quot;a Tiffany, which had forgotten how to make silver&quot;, he left MGM after auditioning for Messala in the 1959 &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;. Stephen Boyd got the role. 

After leaving the studios, Nielsen landed the lead role in the Disney miniseries &quot;The Swamp Fox&quot;, as American Revolutionary War hero Francis Marion. In a 1988 interview, he reflected on the series: &quot;That was a great experience, because the Disney people didn&#x27;t do their shows like everyone else, knocking out an episode a week. ... We only had to do an episode a month, and the budgets were extremely high for TV at that time. We had location shooting rather than cheap studio backdrops, and very authentic costumes.&quot; Eight episodes were produced and aired between 1959 and 1961.
His television appearances include &quot;Justice&quot;, &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;, &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot;, &quot;Wagon Train&quot;, &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, &quot;The Virginian&quot;, and &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot;. In 1961, he was the lead in a Los Angeles police drama called &quot;The New Breed&quot;. He guest-starred in a 1964 episode of &quot;Daniel Boone&quot; with Fess Parker in a minor but credited role. In 1968, he had a major role in the pilot for the police series &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;, and appeared in one of the seventh-season episodes. In 1969, he had the leading role as a police officer in &quot;The Bold Ones: The Protectors&quot;.

In 1972, Nielsen appeared in the supporting role as the captain of the doomed ocean liner SS &quot;Poseidon&quot; in the disaster epic, &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot;. He also starred in the William Girdler&#x27;s 1977 action film, &quot;Project: Kill&quot;. He was cast in the 1979 Canadian disaster film &quot;City on Fire&quot;, in which he portrayed a corrupt mayor. In 1980, he guest-starred as Sinclair in the CBS TV miniseries &quot;The Chisholms&quot;.

===Comedy: &quot;Airplane!&quot; and &quot;The Naked Gun&quot;===
In an early comedic appearance, Nielsen appeared on &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; in 1973 as the title character in &quot;The Ringbanger&quot;. 

Nielsen&#x27;s supporting role of Dr. Rumack in Zucker, Abrahams, and Zucker&#x27;s (ZAZ) 1980&#x27;s &quot;Airplane!&quot; was a turning point in his career. The film, a parody of disaster films such as &quot;Zero Hour!&quot; and &quot;Airport&quot;, was based on building a comedy around &quot;serious&quot; actors better known for their dramatic roles. Other &quot;straight&quot; stars in the film included Robert Stack, Peter Graves, and Lloyd Bridges. Nielsen&#x27;s deadpan delivery contrasted with the absurdity surrounding him. When asked, &quot;Surely you can&#x27;t be serious?&quot;, his curt, now iconic response was: &quot;I am serious. And don&#x27;t call me Shirley.&quot; In several later interviews, he reflected on the line: &quot;I thought it was amusing, but it never occurred to me that it was going to become a trademark. It&#x27;s such a surprise ... the thing comes out, people say, &#x27;What did he say?!&#x27;.&quot; 

Nielsen said he was &quot;pleased and honoured that [he] had a chance to deliver that line&quot;. As of 2010, the comedic exchange was at number 79 on the American Film Institute&#x27;s AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes. The American Film Institute included the film in its list of the top ten comedy films of all time in 2008, and a 2007 survey in the United Kingdom judged it the second-greatest comedy film of all time after &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Life of Brian&quot;. In 2012, &quot;Empire&quot; voted it number one in the 50 Funniest Comedies Ever poll. Critics praised the film, which also proved a long-term success with audiences. In 2010, &quot;Airplane!&quot; was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress.

The directors cast Nielsen for his ability to play like &quot;a fish in water&quot;, saying: &quot;You could have cast funny people and done it with everybody winking, goofing off, and silly ... we wanted people to be oblivious to the comedy.&quot; For Nielsen, &quot;Airplane!&quot; marked a career shift from dramatic roles to deadpan comedy. When it was suggested his role in &quot;Airplane!&quot; was against type, Nielsen protested that he had &quot;always been cast against type before&quot;, and that comedy was what he always wanted to do. In 1982, ZAZ cast Nielsen in a similar style, in their ABC TV series &quot;Police Squad!&quot;. The spoof series introduced Nielsen as Lt. Frank Drebin, the stereotypical police officer modeled after serious characters, such as Joe Friday, in earlier police TV dramas.

The opening sequence for &quot;Police Squad!&quot; was based on the 1950s show &quot;M Squad&quot;, which starred Lee Marvin, and opened with footage of a police car roving through a dark urban setting with a big band playing a jazz song in the background. The Hank Simms voice-over and the show&#x27;s organization into acts with an epilogue was homage to Quinn Martin police dramas including &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, &quot;The Streets of San Francisco&quot;, &quot;Barnaby Jones&quot;, &quot;The F.B.I.&quot;, &quot;Dan August&quot; and &quot;Cannon&quot;. Nielsen portrayed a serious character whose one-liners appeared accidental next to the pratfalls and sight gags that were happening around him. Nielsen received an Emmy Award nomination for his performance and despite positive critical reviews, the series was cancelled after just six episodes.

Six years after cancellation of &quot;Police Squad!&quot;, the film &quot;The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!&quot; returned Nielsen to his role as Frank Drebin. It involved a ruthless drug king using hypnosis to attempt an assassination on Queen Elizabeth II. Nielsen did many of his own stunts: &quot;You have an idea of how you&#x27;re going to do something, and it&#x27;s your vision ... unless you do it, it really doesn&#x27;t stand a chance.&quot; This movie grossed over $78 million and was well received by critics. Ebert&#x27;s –star review (out of four) noted: &quot;You laugh, and then you laugh at yourself for laughing.&quot;

&quot;The Naked Gun&quot; spawned two sequels: &quot;The Naked Gun 2½: The Smell of Fear&quot; (1991) and &quot;Naked Gun : The Final Insult&quot; (1994). &quot;The Naked Gun 2½&quot; grossed more than the original, with $86.9 million, while &quot;&quot; grossed $51.1 million. Nielsen remained open to a fourth &quot;Naked Gun&quot; film, although he doubted that it would be produced — &quot;I don&#x27;t think so&quot;, he said in 2005. &quot;If there hasn&#x27;t been one by now, I doubt it. I think it would be wonderful.&quot;

Nielsen briefly appeared on the World Wrestling Federation program in the summer of 1994 on &quot;WWF Monday Night Raw&quot;, spoofing the role of Frank Drebin. Nielsen and &quot;Naked Gun&quot; co-star George Kennedy were hired as sleuths to unravel the mystery of the Undertaker, who had disappeared at January&#x27;s Royal Rumble event. At SummerSlam 1994, in a &quot;Naked Gun&quot; parody, they were hot on the case (in fact, they were standing on a case). Although they did not find the Undertaker, the case had been closed (the literal case had been shut), thus they solved the mystery. In 1990, Nielsen appeared as a Frank Drebin type character in advertisements for Red Rock Cider in the United Kingdom.

Nielsen&#x27;s few dramatic roles following his comedic success in &quot;Airplane!&quot; included the horror films &quot;Prom Night&quot; (1980) and &quot;Creepshow&quot; (1982). He appeared as a dramatic and unsympathetic character in the 1986 comedy &quot;Soul Man&quot;. His final dramatic role was as Allen Green, a violent client killed in self defense by prostitute Claudia Draper (Barbra Streisand) in Martin Ritt&#x27;s courtroom drama &quot;Nuts&quot; (1987).

===Later comedies===
After &quot;Airplane!&quot; and &quot;The Naked Gun&quot;, Nielsen portrayed similarly styled roles in a number of other films. These mostly emulated the style of &quot;The Naked Gun&quot; with varying success and often targeted specific films; many were panned by critics and most performed poorly. &quot;Repossessed&quot; (1990) and &quot;2001: A Space Travesty&quot; (2001) were parodies of &quot;The Exorcist&quot; and &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, respectively. Both attempted absurd comedy, but were poorly received. Even a leading role in a Mel Brooks comic horror, &quot;&quot;, failed to generate much box-office excitement, although it did gain a following in a later release to video. Both 1996&#x27;s &quot;Spy Hard&quot; and 1998&#x27;s &quot;Wrongfully Accused&quot;, a parody of James Bond films and &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, were popular on video, but not well received by critics.

His attempt at family and children&#x27;s comedies met additional criticism. He appeared as Santa Claus in the Christmas comedy &quot;All I Want for Christmas&quot; (1991), a film that was at best only moderately successful at the box office, and had bad reviews. &quot;Surf Ninjas&quot; (1993) and &quot;Mr. Magoo&quot; (1997) also had scathing reviews. Several critics were disappointed that Nielsen&#x27;s role in &quot;Surf Ninjas&quot; was only &quot;an extended cameo&quot; and Chris Hicks recommended that viewers &quot;avoid any comedy that features Leslie Nielsen outside of the &quot;Naked Gun&quot; series&quot;. Jeff Miller of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; panned &quot;Mr. Magoo&quot;, a live-action remake of the 1950s cartoon: &quot;I&#x27;m supposed to suggest how the film might be better, but I can&#x27;t think of anything to say other than to make the film again.&quot;

Nielsen&#x27;s first major success since &quot;The Naked Gun&quot; came in a supporting role in &quot;Scary Movie 3&quot; (2003). His appearance as President Harris led to a second appearance in its sequel, &quot;Scary Movie 4&quot; (2006). This was the first time Nielsen had reprised a character since Frank Drebin. In one scene, Nielsen appeared almost nude, and one critic referred to the scene as putting &quot;the &#x27;scary&#x27; in &quot;Scary Movie 4&quot;&quot;.

===Video, stage, and celebrity productions===
Nielsen also produced instructional golf videos, which were not presented in a serious style, beginning with 1993&#x27;s &quot;Bad Golf Made Easier&quot;. The videos combined comedy with golf techniques. The series spawned two additional sequels, &quot;Bad Golf My Way&quot; (1994) and &quot;Stupid Little Golf Video&quot; (1997). Nielsen also co-wrote a fictional autobiography titled &quot;The Naked Truth&quot;. The book portrayed Nielsen as a popular actor with a long history of prestigious films.

In his 80s, Nielsen performed serious roles on screen and stage (such as his one-man theatre show &quot;Darrow&quot;, in which he played Clarence Darrow), as well as providing voice-overs and appearances for commercials (including spots for a credit union in Arizona, where he owned a secondary residence), cartoons such as &quot;Zeroman&quot;, where he had the leading role/voice, children&#x27;s shows, such as &quot;Pumper Pups&quot;, which he narrated, and comedic film roles. The sibling relationship with his elder brother, the Honourable Erik Nielsen, a former Deputy Prime Minister of Canada, served as the premise of an HBO mockumentary entitled &quot;The Canadian Conspiracy&quot; in which Leslie Nielsen appeared, along with other prominent Canadian-born media personalities. He was a celebrity contestant on CBS&#x27;s &quot;Gameshow Marathon&quot;, where he played &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot;, &quot;Beat the Clock&quot;, and &quot;Press Your Luck&quot; for charity.

===Final acting years===

Beginning in February 2007, Nielsen began playing a small role as a doctor in the humorous yet educational television show &quot;Doctor*Ology&quot;. The show chronicles real-life medical techniques and technology on the Discovery Channel. Nielsen said:
In 2007, Nielsen starred in the drama &quot;Music Within&quot;. In 2008, he portrayed a version of Uncle Ben for &quot;Superhero Movie&quot;, a spoof of superhero films. He then appeared in the 2008 parody &quot;An American Carol&quot;, which David Zucker directed, produced, and co-wrote. He appeared in the 2009 parody &quot;Stan Helsing&quot;. Nielsen portrayed the doctor in the Spanish horror comedy &quot;Spanish Movie&quot;, a spoof comedy like &quot;Scary Movie&quot;, but making fun of popular Spanish films.

Nielsen appeared in more than 100 films and 1,500 television episodes, portraying more than 220 characters. From at least the early 1970s, he was a television commercial spokesperson for the Bank of Montreal, Ford, Shell and Dollar Rent-A-Car, among many others; his earlier spots took advantage of his serious and authoritative persona, while later commercials were more humorous, mirroring his transition to comedic acting roles.

==Personal life==
Nielsen married four times: to nightclub singer Monica Boyar (1950–1956), Alisande Ullman (1958–1973), Brooks Oliver (1981–1983), and Barbaree Earl (2001 – his death in 2010). He had two daughters from his second marriage, Maura and Thea Nielsen.

Nielsen often played golf. He joked, &quot;I have no goals or ambition. I do, however, wish to work enough to maintain whatever celebrity status I have so that they will continue to invite me to golf tournaments.&quot; His interest in the sport led him to comedic instructional films.

Nielsen was a practical joker, and known for pranking people with a portable hand-controlled fart machine. His epitaph reads &quot;Let &#x27;er rip&quot;, a final reference to his favorite practical joke.

In his later years, Nielsen and his wife Barbaree resided between homes in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and Paradise Valley, Arizona.

Nielsen was legally deaf and wore hearing aids for most of his life. Because of this, he supported the Better Hearing Institute. Later in life, he
had knee osteoarthritis. He participated in an educational video from The Arthritis Research Centre of Canada, demonstrating the physical examination of a patient with knee osteoarthritis.

==Death and funeral==

In November 2010, Nielsen was admitted to Holy Cross Hospital, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, with pneumonia. On November 28, his nephew Doug told the CJOB radio station that he died in his sleep from pneumonia around 5:30 p.m. EST, aged 84, surrounded by family and friends. 

Nielsen&#x27;s body was interred in Fort Lauderdale&#x27;s Evergreen Cemetery. As a final bit of humour, he chose &quot;Let &#x27;er rip&quot; as his epitaph. On December 7, 2010, his funeral was held in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, during which the &quot;Naked Gun&quot; theme played.

==Achievements==
Among his awards, in 1995 Nielsen received UCLA&#x27;s Jack Benny Award. In 1988, he became the 1,884th personality to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6541 Hollywood Blvd. In 2001 he was inducted into Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame. The following year he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada, although he was also a naturalized US citizen. 

With Nielsen&#x27;s American citizenship, he maintained his Canadian heritage: &quot;There&#x27;s no way you can be a Canadian and think you can lose it ... Canadians are a goodly group. They are very aware of caring and helping.&quot; On May 19, 2005, when Queen Elizabeth II visited his native Saskatchewan during the province&#x27;s centennial gala, she was introduced to Nielsen.

In 1997, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs, California, Walk of Stars was dedicated to him.

On February 20, 2002, Nielsen was named an honorary citizen of West Virginia and an Ambassador of Mountain State Goodwill. Nielsen visited the state many times to speak and visit friends. In 2003, in honour of Nielsen, Grant MacEwan College named its school of communications after him. Also in 2003, the Alliance of Canadian Cinema, Television and Radio Artists awarded him the ACTRA Award of Excellence.

<text>Ivo Andrić (, ; born Ivan Andrić; 9 October 1892 – 13 March 1975) was a Yugoslav novelist, poet and short story writer who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1961. His writings dealt mainly with life in his native Bosnia under Ottoman rule.

Born in Travnik in Austria-Hungary, modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina, Andrić attended high school in Sarajevo, where he became an active member of several South Slav national youth organizations. Following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in June 1914, Andrić was arrested and imprisoned by the Austro-Hungarian police, who suspected his involvement in the plot. As the authorities were unable to build a strong case against him, he spent much of the war under house arrest, only being released following a general amnesty for such cases in July 1917. After the war, he studied South Slavic history and literature at universities in Zagreb and Graz, eventually attaining his PhD. in Graz in 1924. He worked in the diplomatic service of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia from 1920 to 1923 and again from 1924 to 1941. In 1939, he became Yugoslavia&#x27;s ambassador to Germany, but his tenure ended in April 1941 with the German-led invasion of his country. Shortly after the invasion, Andrić returned to German-occupied Belgrade. He lived quietly in a friend&#x27;s apartment for the duration of World War II, in conditions likened by some biographers to house arrest, and wrote some of his most important works, including &quot;Na Drini ćuprija&quot; (&quot;The Bridge on the Drina&quot;).

Following the war, Andrić was named to a number of ceremonial posts in Yugoslavia, which had since come under communist rule. In 1961, the Nobel Committee awarded him the Nobel Prize in Literature, selecting him over writers such as J. R. R. Tolkien, Robert Frost, John Steinbeck and E. M. Forster. The Committee cited &quot;the epic force with which he ... traced themes and depicted human destinies drawn from his country&#x27;s history&quot;. Afterwards, Andrić&#x27;s works found an international audience and were translated into a number of languages. In subsequent years, he received a number of awards in his native country. Andrić&#x27;s health declined substantially in late 1974 and he died in Belgrade the following March.

In the years following Andrić&#x27;s death, the Belgrade apartment where he spent much of World War II was converted into a museum and a nearby street corner was named in his honour. A number of other cities in the former Yugoslavia also have streets bearing his name. In 2012, filmmaker Emir Kusturica began construction of an ethno-town in eastern Bosnia that is named after Andrić. As Yugoslavia&#x27;s only Nobel Prize-winning writer, Andrić was well known and respected in his native country during his lifetime. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, beginning in the 1950s and continuing past the breakup of Yugoslavia, his works have been disparaged by Bosniak literary critics for their supposed anti-Muslim bias. In Croatia, his works had occasionally been blacklisted following Yugoslavia&#x27;s dissolution in the 1990s, but were rehabilitated by the literary community. He is highly regarded in Serbia for his contributions to Serbian literature.

==Early life==
===Family===

Ivan Andrić was born in the village of Dolac, near Travnik, on 9 October 1892, while his mother, Katarina (), was in the town visiting relatives. Andrić&#x27;s parents were both Catholic Croats. He was his parents&#x27; only child. His father, Antun, was a struggling silversmith who resorted to working as a school janitor in Sarajevo, where he lived with his wife and infant son. At the age of 32, Antun died of tuberculosis, like most of his siblings. Andrić was only two years old at the time. Widowed and penniless, Andrić&#x27;s mother took him to Višegrad and placed him in the care of her sister-in-law Ana and brother-in-law Ivan Matković, a police officer. The couple were financially stable but childless, so they agreed to look after the infant and brought him up as their own. Meanwhile, Andrić&#x27;s mother returned to Sarajevo seeking employment.

Andrić was raised in a country that had changed little since the Ottoman period despite being mandated to Austria-Hungary at the Congress of Berlin in 1878. Eastern and Western culture intermingled in Bosnia to a far greater extent than anywhere else in the Balkan peninsula. Having lived there from an early age, Andrić came to cherish Višegrad, calling it &quot;my real home&quot;. Though it was a small provincial town (or &quot;kasaba&quot;), Višegrad proved to be an enduring source of inspiration. It was a multi-ethnic and multi-confessional town, the predominant groups being Serbs (Orthodox Christians) and Bosniaks (Muslims). From an early age, Andrić closely observed the customs of the local people. These customs, and the particularities of life in eastern Bosnia, would later be detailed in his works. Andrić made his first friends in Višegrad, playing with them along the Drina River and the town&#x27;s famous Mehmed Paša Sokolović Bridge.

===Primary and secondary education===

At age six, Andrić began primary school. He later recounted that these were the happiest days of his life. At the age of ten, he received a three-year scholarship from a Croat cultural group called &quot;Napredak&quot; (Progress) to study in Sarajevo. In the autumn of 1902, he was registered at the Great Sarajevo Gymnasium (), the oldest secondary school in Bosnia. While in Sarajevo, Andrić lived with his mother, who worked in a rug factory. At the time, the city was overflowing with civil servants from all parts of Austria-Hungary, and thus many languages could be heard in its restaurants, cafés and on its streets. Culturally, the city boasted a strong Germanic element, and the curriculum in educational institutions was designed to reflect this. From a total of 83 teachers that worked at Andrić&#x27;s school over a twenty-year period, only three were natives of Bosnia and Herzegovina. &quot;The teaching program,&quot; biographer Celia Hawkesworth notes, &quot;was devoted to producing dedicated supporters of the [Habsburg] Monarchy&quot;. Andrić disapproved. &quot;All that came ... at secondary school and university,&quot; he wrote, &quot;was rough, crude, automatic, without concern, faith, humanity, warmth or love.&quot;

Andrić experienced difficulty in his studies, finding mathematics particularly challenging, and had to repeat the sixth grade. For a time, he lost his scholarship due to poor grades. Hawkesworth attributes Andrić&#x27;s initial lack of academic success at least partly to his alienation from most of his teachers. Nonetheless, he excelled in languages, particularly Latin, Greek and German. Although he initially showed substantial interest in natural sciences, he later began focusing on literature, likely under the influence of his two Croat instructors, writer and politician Đuro Šurmin and poet Tugomir Alaupović. Of all his teachers in Sarajevo, Andrić liked Alaupović best, and the two became lifelong friends.

Andrić felt he was destined to become a writer. He began writing in secondary school, but received little encouragement from his mother. He recalled that when he showed her one of his first works, she replied: &quot;Did you write this? What did you do that for?&quot; Andrić published his first two poems in 1911 in a journal called &quot;Bosanska vila&quot; (Bosnian Fairy), which promoted Serbo-Croat unity. At the time, he was still a secondary school student. Prior to World War I, his poems, essays, reviews, and translations appeared in journals such as &quot;Vihor&quot; (Whirlwind), &quot;Savremenik&quot; (The Contemporary), &quot;Hrvatski pokret&quot; (The Croatian Movement), and &quot;Književne novine&quot; (Literary News). One of Andrić&#x27;s favorite literary forms was lyrical reflective prose, and many of his essays and shorter pieces are prose poems. The historian Wayne S. Vucinich describes Andrić&#x27;s poetry from this period as &quot;subjective and mostly melancholic&quot;. Andrić&#x27;s translations of August Strindberg, Walt Whitman, and a number of Slovene authors also appeared around this time.

===Student activism===
In 1908, Austria-Hungary officially annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina, to the chagrin of South Slav nationalists like Andrić. In late 1911, Andrić was elected the first president of the Serbo-Croat Progressive Movement (; SHNO), a Sarajevo-based secret society that promoted unity and friendship between Serb and Croat youth and opposed the Austro-Hungarian occupation. Its members were vehemently criticized by both Serb and Croat nationalists, who dismissed them as &quot;traitors to their nations&quot;. Unfazed, Andrić continued agitating against the Austro-Hungarians. On 28 February 1912, he spoke before a crowd of 100 student protesters at Sarajevo&#x27;s railway station, urging them to continue their demonstrations. The Austro-Hungarian police later began harassing and prosecuting SHNO members. Ten were expelled from their schools or penalized in some other way, though Andrić himself escaped punishment. Andrić also joined the South Slav student movement known as Young Bosnia, becoming one of its most prominent members.

In 1912, Andrić registered at the University of Zagreb, having received a scholarship from an educational foundation in Sarajevo. He enrolled in the department of mathematics and natural sciences because these were the only fields for which scholarships were offered, but was able to take some courses in Croatian literature. Andrić was well received by South Slav nationalists there, and regularly participated in on-campus demonstrations. This led to his being reprimanded by the university. In 1913, after completing two semesters in Zagreb, Andrić transferred to the University of Vienna, where he resumed his studies. While in Vienna, he joined South Slav students in promoting the cause of Yugoslav unity and worked closely with two Yugoslav student societies, the Serbian cultural society &quot;Zora&quot; (Dawn) and the Croatian student club &quot;Zvonimir&quot;, which shared his views on &quot;integral Yugoslavism&quot; (the eventual assimilation of all South Slav cultures into one).

Despite finding like-minded students in Vienna, the city&#x27;s climate took a toll on Andrić&#x27;s health. He contracted tuberculosis and became seriously ill, then asked to leave Vienna on medical grounds and continue his studies elsewhere, though Hawkesworth believes he may actually have been taking part in a protest of South Slav students that were boycotting German-speaking universities and transferring to Slavic ones. For a time, Andrić had considered transferring to a school in Russia but ultimately decided to complete his fourth semester at Jagiellonian University in Kraków. He transferred in early 1914. Andrić started his literary career as a poet. In 1914, he was one of the contributors to &quot;Hrvatska mlada lirika&quot; (Croatian Youth Lyrics) and continued to publish translations, poems and reviews.

==World War I==
On 28 June 1914, Andrić learned of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo. The assassin was Gavrilo Princip, a Young Bosnian and close friend of Andrić who had been one of the first to join the SHNO in 1911. Upon hearing the news, Andrić decided to leave Kraków and return to Bosnia. He travelled by train to Zagreb, and in mid-July, departed for the coastal city of Split with his friend, the poet and fellow South Slav nationalist Vladimir Čerina. Andrić and Čerina spent the rest of July at the latter&#x27;s summer home. As the month progressed, the two became increasingly uneasy about the escalating political crisis that followed the Archduke&#x27;s assassination and eventually led to the outbreak of World War I. They then went to Rijeka, where Čerina left Andrić without explanation, only saying he urgently needed to go to Italy. Several days later, Andrić learned that Čerina was being sought by the police.

By the time war was declared, Andrić had returned to Split feeling exhausted and ill. Given that most of his friends had already been arrested for nationalist activities, he was certain the same fate would befall him. Despite not being involved in the assassination plot, in late July or early August, Andrić was arrested for &quot;anti-state activities&quot;, and imprisoned in Split. He was subsequently transferred to a prison in Šibenik, then to Rijeka and finally to Maribor, where he arrived on 19 August. Plagued by tuberculosis, Andrić passed the time reading, talking to his cellmates and learning languages.

By the following year, the case against Andrić was dropped due to lack of evidence, and he was released from prison on 20 March 1915. The authorities exiled him to the village of Ovčarevo, near Travnik. He arrived there on 22 March and was placed under the supervision of local Franciscan friars. Andrić soon befriended the friar Alojzije Perčinlić and began researching the history of Bosnia&#x27;s Catholic and Orthodox Christian communities under Ottoman rule. Andrić lived in the parish headquarters, and the Franciscans gave him access to the monastery chronicles. In return, he assisted the parish priest and taught religious songs to pupils at the monastery school. Andrić&#x27;s mother soon came to visit him and offered to serve as the parish priest&#x27;s housekeeper. &quot;Mother is very happy,&quot; Andrić wrote. &quot;It has been three whole years since she saw me. And she can&#x27;t grasp all that has happened to me in that time, nor the whole of my crazy, cursed existence. She cries, kisses me and laughs in turn. Like a mother.&quot;

Andrić was later transferred to a prison in Zenica, where Perčinlić regularly visited him. The Austro-Hungarian Army declared Andrić a political threat in March 1917 and exempted him from armed service. He was thus registered with a non-combat unit until February of the following year. On 2 July 1917, Emperor Charles declared a general amnesty for all of Austria-Hungary&#x27;s political prisoners. His freedom of movement restored, Andrić visited Višegrad and reunited with several of his school friends. He remained in Višegrad until late July, when he was mobilized. Because of his poor health, Andrić was admitted to a Sarajevo hospital and thus avoided service. He was then transferred to the &quot;Reservospital&quot; in Zenica, where he received treatment for several months before continuing to Zagreb. There, Andrić again fell seriously ill and sought treatment at the Sisters of Mercy hospital, which had become a gathering place for dissidents and former political prisoners.

In January 1918, Andrić joined several South Slav nationalists in editing a short-lived pan-Yugoslav periodical called &quot;Književni jug&quot; (Literary South). Here and in other periodicals, Andrić published book reviews, plays, verse, and translations. Over the course of several months in early 1918, Andrić&#x27;s health began to deteriorate, and his friends believed he was nearing death. However, he recovered and spent the spring of 1918 in Krapina writing &quot;Ex ponto&quot;, a book of prose poetry that was published in July. It was his first book.

==Interwar period==
The end of World War I saw the disintegration of Austria-Hungary, which was replaced by a newly established South Slav state, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (renamed Yugoslavia in 1929). In late 1918, Andrić re-enrolled at the University of Zagreb and resumed his studies. By January 1919, he fell ill again and was back in the hospital. Fellow writer Ivo Vojnović became worried for his friend&#x27;s life and appealed to Andrić&#x27;s old schoolteacher Tugomir Alaupović (who had just been appointed the new kingdom&#x27;s Minister of Religious Affairs) to use his connections and help Andrić pay for treatment abroad. In February, Andrić wrote Alaupović and asked for help finding a government job in Belgrade. Eventually, Andrić chose to seek treatment in Split, where he stayed for the following six months. During his time on the Mediterranean coast, Andrić completed a second volume of prose poetry, titled &quot;Nemiri&quot;, which was published the following year. By the time Andrić left, he had almost fully recovered, and quipped that he was cured by the &quot;air, sun and figs.&quot; Troubled by news that his uncle was seriously ill, Andrić left Split in August and went to him in Višegrad. He returned to Zagreb two weeks later.

===Early diplomatic career===

In the immediate aftermath of the war, Andrić&#x27;s tendency to identify with Serbdom became increasingly apparent. In a correspondence dated December 1918, Vojnović described the young writer as &quot;a Catholic ... a Serb from Bosnia.&quot; By 1919, Andrić had acquired his undergraduate degree in South Slavic history and literature at the University of Zagreb. He was perennially impoverished, and earned a meagre sum through his writing and editorial work. By mid-1919, he realized that he would be unable to financially support himself and his aging mother, aunt and uncle for much longer, and his appeals to Alaupović for help securing a government job became more frequent. In September 1919, Alaupović offered him a secretarial position at the Ministry of Religion, which Andrić accepted.

In late October, Andrić left for Belgrade. He became involved in the city&#x27;s literary circles and soon acquired the distinction of being one of Belgrade&#x27;s most popular young writers. Though the Belgrade press wrote positively of him, Andrić disliked being a public figure, and went into seclusion and distanced himself from his fellow writers. At the same time, he grew dissatisfied with his government job and wrote to Alaupović asking for a transfer to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. On 20 February, Andrić&#x27;s request was granted and he was assigned to the Foreign Ministry&#x27;s mission at the Vatican.

Andrić left Belgrade soon after, and reported for duty in late February. At this time, he published his first short story, &quot;Put Alije Đerzeleza&quot; (The Journey of Alija Đerzelez). He complained that the consulate was understaffed and that he did not have enough time to write. All evidence suggests he had a strong distaste for the ceremony and pomp that accompanied his work in the diplomatic service, but according to Hawkesworth, he endured it with &quot;dignified good grace&quot;. Around this time, he began writing in the Ekavian dialect used in Serbia, and ceased writing in the Ijekavian dialect used in his native Bosnia. Andrić soon requested another assignment, and in November, he was transferred to Bucharest. Once again, his health deteriorated. Nevertheless, Andrić found his consular duties there did not require much effort, so he focused on writing, contributed articles to a Romanian journal and even had time to visit his family in Bosnia. In 1922, Andrić requested another reassignment. He was transferred to the consulate in Trieste, where he arrived on 9 December. The city&#x27;s damp climate only caused Andrić&#x27;s health to deteriorate further, and on his doctor&#x27;s advice, he transferred to Graz in January 1923. He arrived in the city on 23 January, and was appointed vice-consul. Andrić soon enrolled at the University of Graz, resumed his schooling and began working on his doctoral dissertation in Slavic studies.

===Advancement===
In August 1923, Andrić experienced an unexpected career setback. A law had been passed stipulating that all civil servants had to have a doctoral degree. As Andrić had not completed his dissertation, he was informed that his employment would be terminated. Andrić&#x27;s well-connected friends intervened on his behalf and appealed to Foreign Minister Momčilo Ninčić, citing Andrić&#x27;s diplomatic and linguistic abilities. In February 1924, the Foreign Ministry decided to retain Andrić as a day worker with the salary of a vice-consul. This gave him the opportunity to complete his Ph.D. Three months later, on 24 May, Andrić submitted his dissertation to a committee of examiners at the University of Graz, who gave it their approval. This allowed Andrić to take the examinations necessary for his Ph.D. to be confirmed. He passed both his exams, and on 13 July, received his Ph.D. The committee of examiners recommended that Andrić&#x27;s dissertation be published. Andrić chose the title &quot;Die Entwicklung des geistigen Lebens in Bosnien unter der Einwirkung der türkischen Herrschaft&quot; (The Development of Spiritual Life in Bosnia Under the Influence of Turkish Rule). In it, he characterized the Ottoman occupation as a yoke that still loomed over Bosnia. &quot;The effect of Turkish rule was absolutely negative,&quot; he wrote. &quot;The Turks could bring no cultural content or sense of higher mission, even to those South Slavs who accepted Islam.&quot;

Several days after receiving his Ph.D., Andrić wrote the Foreign Minister asking to be reinstated and submitted a copy of his dissertation, university documents and a medical certification that deemed him to be in good health. In September, the Foreign Ministry granted his request. Andrić stayed in Graz until 31 October, when he was assigned to the Foreign Ministry&#x27;s Belgrade headquarters. During the two years he was in Belgrade, Andrić spent much of his time writing. His first collection of short stories was published in 1924, and he received a prize from the Serbian Royal Academy (of which he became a full-fledged member in February 1926). In October 1926, he was assigned to the consulate in Marseille and again appointed vice-consul. On 9 December 1926, he was transferred to the Yugoslav embassy in Paris. Andrić&#x27;s time in France was marked by increasing loneliness and isolation. His uncle had died in 1924, his mother the following year, and upon arriving in France, he was informed that his aunt had died as well. &quot;Apart from official contacts,&quot; he wrote Alaupović, &quot;I have no company whatever.&quot; Andrić spent much of his time in the Paris archives poring over the reports of the French consulate in Travnik between 1809 and 1814, material he would use in &quot;Travnička hronika&quot;, one of his future novels.

In April 1928, Andrić was posted to Madrid as vice-consul. While there, he wrote essays on Simón Bolívar and Francisco Goya, and began work on the novel &quot;Prokleta avlija&quot; (The Damned Yard). In June 1929, he was named secretary of the Yugoslav legation to Belgium and Luxembourg in Brussels. On 1 January 1930, he was sent to Switzerland as part of Yugoslavia&#x27;s permanent delegation to the League of Nations in Geneva, and was named deputy delegate the following year. In 1933, Andrić returned to Belgrade; two years later, he was named head of the political department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. On 5 November 1937, Andrić became assistant to Milan Stojadinović, Yugoslavia&#x27;s Prime Minister and Foreign Minister. That year, France decorated him with the Order of the Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour.

==World War II==
Andrić was appointed Yugoslavia&#x27;s ambassador to Germany in late March or early April 1939. This appointment, Hawkesworth writes, shows that he was highly regarded by his country&#x27;s leadership. Yugoslavia&#x27;s King Alexander had been assassinated in Marseille in 1934. He was succeeded by his ten-year-old son Peter, and a regency council led by Peter&#x27;s uncle Paul was established to rule in his place until he turned 18. Paul&#x27;s government established closer economic and political ties with Germany. In March 1941, Yugoslavia signed the Tripartite Pact, pledging support for Germany and Italy. Though the negotiations had occurred behind Andrić&#x27;s back, in his capacity as ambassador he was obliged to attend the document&#x27;s signing in Berlin. Andrić had previously been instructed to delay agreeing to the Axis powers&#x27; demands for as long as possible. He was highly critical of the move, and on 17 March, wrote to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs asking to be relieved of his duties. Ten days later, a group of pro-Western Royal Yugoslav Air Force officers overthrew the regency and proclaimed Peter of age. This led to a breakdown in relations with Germany and prompted Adolf Hitler to order Yugoslavia&#x27;s invasion. Given these circumstances, Andrić&#x27;s position was an extremely difficult one. Nevertheless, he used the little influence he had and attempted unsuccessfully to assist Polish prisoners following the German invasion of Poland in September 1939.

Prior to their invasion of his country, the Germans had offered Andrić the opportunity to evacuate to neutral Switzerland. He declined on the basis that his staff would not be allowed to go with him. On 6 April 1941, the Germans and their allies invaded Yugoslavia. The country capitulated on 17 April and was subsequently partitioned between the Axis powers. In early June, Andrić and his staff were taken back to German-occupied Belgrade, where some were jailed. Andrić was retired from the diplomatic service, but refused to receive his pension or cooperate in any way with the puppet government that the Germans had installed in Serbia. He was spared jail, but the Germans kept him under close surveillance throughout the occupation. Because of his Croat heritage, they had offered him the chance to settle in Zagreb, then the capital of the fascist puppet state known as the Independent State of Croatia, but he declined. Andrić spent the following three years in a friend&#x27;s Belgrade apartment in conditions that some biographers liken to house arrest. In August 1941, the puppet authorities in German-occupied Serbia issued the Appeal to the Serbian Nation, calling upon the country&#x27;s inhabitants to abstain from the communist-led rebellion against the Germans; Andrić refused to sign. He directed most of his energies towards writing, and during this time completed two of his best known novels, &quot;Na Drini ćuprija&quot; (&quot;The Bridge on the Drina&quot;) and &quot;Travnička hronika&quot;.

In mid-1942, Andrić sent a message of sympathy to Draža Mihailović, the leader of the royalist Chetniks, one of two resistance movements vying for power in Axis-occupied Yugoslavia, the other being Josip Broz Tito&#x27;s communist Partisans. In 1944, Andrić was forced to leave his friend&#x27;s apartment during the Allied bombing of Belgrade and evacuate the city. As he joined a column of refugees, he became ashamed that he was fleeing by himself, in contrast to the masses of people accompanied by their children, spouses and infirm parents. &quot;I looked myself up and down,&quot; he wrote, &quot;and saw I was saving only myself and my overcoat.&quot; In the ensuing months, Andrić refused to leave the apartment, even during the heaviest bombing. That October, the Red Army and the Partisans drove the Germans out of Belgrade, and Tito proclaimed himself Yugoslavia&#x27;s ruler.

==Later life==
===Political career and marriage===

Andrić initially had a precarious relationship with the communists because he had previously been an official in the royalist government. He returned to public life only once the Germans had been forced out of Belgrade. &quot;Na Drini ćuprija&quot; was published in March 1945. It was followed by &quot;Travnička hronika&quot; that September and &quot;Gospođica&quot; that November. &quot;Na Drini ćuprija&quot; came to be regarded as Andrić&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus&quot; and was proclaimed a classic of Yugoslav literature by the communists. It chronicles the history of the Mehmed Paša Sokolović Bridge and the town of Višegrad from the bridge&#x27;s construction in the 16th century until the outbreak of World War I. The second novel, &quot;Travnička hronika&quot;, follows a French diplomat in Bosnia during the Napoleonic Wars. The third, &quot;Gospođica&quot;, revolves around the life of a Sarajevan woman. In the post-war period, Andrić also published several short story collections, some travel memoirs, and a number of essays on writers such as Vuk Karadžić, Petar II Petrović-Njegoš, and Petar Kočić.

In November 1946, Andrić was elected vice-president of the Society for the Cultural Cooperation of Yugoslavia with the Soviet Union. The same month, he was named president of the Yugoslav Writers&#x27; Union. The following year, he became a member of the People&#x27;s Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 1948, Andrić published a collection of short stories he had written during the war. His work came to influence writers such as Branko Ćopić, Vladan Desnica, Mihailo Lalić and Meša Selimović. In April 1950, Andrić became a deputy in the National Assembly of Yugoslavia. He was decorated by the Presidium of the National Assembly for his services to the Yugoslav people in 1952. In 1953, his career as a parliamentary deputy came to an end. The following year, Andrić published the novella &quot;Prokleta avlija&quot; (The Damned Yard), which tells of life in an Ottoman prison in Istanbul. That December, he was admitted into the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, the country&#x27;s ruling party. According to Hawkesworth, it is unlikely he joined the party out of ideological conviction, but rather to &quot;serve his country as fully as possible&quot;.

On 27 September 1958, the 66-year-old Andrić married Milica Babić, a costume designer at the National Theatre of Serbia who was almost twenty years his junior. Earlier, he had announced it was &quot;probably better&quot; that a writer never marry. &quot;He was perpetually persecuted by a kind of fear,&quot; a close friend recalled. &quot;It seemed as though he had been born afraid, and that is why he married so late. He simply did not dare enter that area of life.&quot;

===Nobel Prize, international recognition and death===

By the late 1950s, Andrić&#x27;s works had been translated into a number of languages. In 1958 the Association of Writers of Yugoslavia nominated Andrić as its first ever candidate for the Nobel Prize in Literature. On 26 October 1961, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature by the Swedish Academy. Documents released 50 years later revealed that the Nobel Committee had selected Andrić over writers such as J.R.R. Tolkien, Robert Frost, John Steinbeck and E.M. Forster. The Committee cited &quot;the epic force with which he has traced themes and depicted human destinies drawn from his country&#x27;s history&quot;. Once the news was announced, Andrić&#x27;s Belgrade apartment was swarmed by reporters, and he publicly thanked the Nobel Committee for selecting him as the winner of that year&#x27;s prize. Andrić donated the entirety of his prize money, which amounted to some 30 million dinars, and prescribed that it be used to purchase library books in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The Nobel Prize ensured Andrić received global recognition. The following March, he fell ill while on a trip to Cairo and had to return to Belgrade for an operation. He was obliged to cancel all promotional events in Europe and North America, but his works continued to be reprinted and translated into numerous languages. Judging by letters he wrote at the time, Andrić felt burdened by the attention but did his best not to show it publicly. Upon receiving the Nobel Prize, the number of awards and honours bestowed upon him multiplied. He received the Order of the Republic in 1962, as well as 27 July Award of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the AVNOJ Award in 1967, and the Order of the Hero of Socialist Labour in 1972. In addition to being a member of the Yugoslav and Serbian academies of sciences and arts, he also became a correspondent of their Bosnian and Slovenian counterparts, and received honorary doctorates from the universities of Belgrade, Sarajevo and Kraków.

Andrić&#x27;s wife died on 16 March 1968. His health deteriorated steadily and he travelled little in his final years. He continued to write until 1974, when his health took another turn for the worse. In December 1974, he was admitted to a Belgrade hospital. He soon fell into a coma, and died in the Military Medical Academy at 1:15 a.m. on 13 March 1975, aged 82. His remains were cremated, and on 24 April, the urn containing his ashes was buried at the Alley of Distinguished Citizens in Belgrade&#x27;s New Cemetery. The ceremony was attended by about 10,000 residents of Belgrade.

==Influences, style and themes==

Andrić was an avid reader in his youth. The young Andrić&#x27;s literary interests varied greatly, ranging from the Greek and Latin Classics to the works of past and contemporary literary figures, including German and Austrian writers such as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Heinrich Heine, Friedrich Nietzsche, Franz Kafka, Rainer Maria Rilke and Thomas Mann, the French writers Michel de Montaigne, Blaise Pascal, Gustave Flaubert, Victor Hugo and Guy de Maupassant, and the British writers Thomas Carlyle, Walter Scott and Joseph Conrad. Andrić also read the works of the Spanish writer Miguel de Cervantes, the Italian poet and philosopher Giacomo Leopardi, the Russian writer Nikolay Chernyshevsky, the Norwegian writer Henrik Ibsen, the American writers Walt Whitman and Henry James, and the Czechoslovak philosopher Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk. Andrić was especially fond of Polish literature, and later stated that it had greatly influenced him. He held several Serb writers in high esteem, particularly Karadžić, Njegoš, Kočić and Aleksa Šantić. Andrić also admired the Slovene poets Fran Levstik, Josip Murn and Oton Župančič, and translated some of their works. Kafka appears to have had a significant influence on Andrić&#x27;s prose, and his philosophical outlook was informed strongly by the works of Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard. At one point in his youth, Andrić even took an interest in Chinese and Japanese literature.

Much of Andrić&#x27;s work was inspired by the traditions and peculiarities of life in Bosnia, and examines the complexity and cultural contrasts of the region&#x27;s Muslim, Serb and Croat inhabitants. His two best known novels, &quot;Na Drini ćuprija&quot; and &quot;Travnička hronika&quot;, subtly contrast Ottoman Bosnia&#x27;s &quot;oriental&quot; propensities to the &quot;Western atmosphere&quot; first introduced by the French and later the Austro-Hungarians. His works contain many words of Turkish, Arabic or Persian origin that found their way into the languages of the South Slavs during Ottoman rule. According to Vucinich, Andrić uses these words to &quot;express oriental nuances and subtleties that cannot be rendered as well in his own Serbo-Croatian&quot;.

In the opinion of literary historian Nicholas Moravcevich, Andrić&#x27;s work &quot;frequently betrays his profound sadness over the misery and waste inherent in the passing of time&quot;. &quot;Na Drini ćuprija&quot; remains his most famous novel and has received the most scholarly analysis of all his works. Most scholars have interpreted the eponymous bridge as a metonym for Yugoslavia, which was itself a bridge between East and West during the Cold War. In his Nobel acceptance speech, Andrić described the country as one &quot;which, at break-neck speed and at the cost of great sacrifices and prodigious efforts, is trying in all fields, including the field of culture, to make up for those things of which it has been deprived by a singularly turbulent and hostile past.&quot; In Andrić&#x27;s view, the seemingly conflicting positions of Yugoslavia&#x27;s disparate ethnic groups could be overcome by knowing one&#x27;s history. This, he surmised, would help future generations avoid the mistakes of the past, and was in line with his cyclical view of time. Andrić expressed hope that these differences could be bridged and &quot;histories demystified&quot;.

==Legacy==

Shortly before his death, Andrić stated that he wished for all his possessions to be preserved as part of an endowment to be used for &quot;general cultural and humanitarian purposes&quot;. In March 1976, an administrative committee decided that the purpose of the endowment would be to promote the study of Andrić&#x27;s work, as well as art and literature in general. The Ivo Andrić Foundation has since organized a number of international conferences, made grants to foreign scholars studying the writer&#x27;s works and offered financial aid to cover the publication costs of books relating to Andrić. An annual yearbook, titled &quot;Sveske Zadužbine Ive Andrića&quot; (The Journals of the Ivo Andrić Foundation), is published by the organization. Andrić&#x27;s will and testament stipulated that an award be given annually to the author of each subsequent year&#x27;s best collection of short stories, which led to the Andrić Prize&#x27;s founding in 1975. The street that runs beside Belgrade&#x27;s New Palace, now the seat of the President of Serbia, was posthumously named &quot;Andrićev venac&quot; (Andrić&#x27;s Crescent) in his honour. It includes a life-sized statue of the writer. The flat in which Andrić spent his final years has been turned into a museum. Opened over a year after Andrić&#x27;s death, it houses books, manuscripts, documents, photographs and personal belongings.

Andrić remains the only writer from the former Yugoslavia to have been awarded the Nobel Prize. Given his use of the Ekavian dialect, and the fact that most of his novels and short stories were written in Belgrade, his works have become associated almost exclusively with Serbian literature. The Slavonic studies professor Bojan Aleksov characterizes Andrić as one of Serbian literature&#x27;s two central pillars, the other being Petar II Petrović-Njegoš. &quot;The plasticity of his narrative,&quot; Moravcevich writes, &quot;the depth of his psychological insight, and the universality of his symbolism remain unsurpassed in all of Serbian literature.&quot; Due to his self-identification as a Serb, many in the Bosniak and Croat literary establishments have come to &quot;reject or limit Andrić&#x27;s association with their literatures&quot;. In Croatia, Andrić was not generally seen as part of Croatian literature even in former Yugoslavia, though that started to change in the Croatian literary circles around 1990. Following Yugoslavia&#x27;s disintegration in the early 1990s, Andrić&#x27;s works were among those that the Croatian Democratic Union activists had purged from some of the city libraries and schools in Croatia. Dubravka Ugrešić criticized the then-President Franjo Tuđman for promoting the likes of Ivan Aralica over Ivo Andrić, Slobodan Šnajder, Slavenka Drakulić and herself. The Croatian historian and politician Ivo Banac characterized Andrić as a writer who &quot;missed the Chetnik train by a very small margin&quot;. Though Andrić remains a controversial figure in Croatia, the Croatian literary establishment largely rehabilitated his works.

Bosniak scholars have objected to the ostensibly negative portrayal of Muslim characters in Andrić&#x27;s works. During the 1950s, his most vocal Bosniak detractors accused him of being a plagiarist, homosexual and Serbian nationalist. Some went so far as to call for his Nobel Prize to be taken away. Most Bosniak criticism of his works appeared in the period immediately prior to the breakup of Yugoslavia and in the aftermath of the Bosnian War. In early 1992, a Bosniak nationalist in Višegrad destroyed a statue of Andrić with a sledgehammer. In 2009, Nezim Halilović, the imam of Sarajevo&#x27;s King Fahd Mosque, derided Andrić as a &quot;Chetnik ideologue&quot; during a sermon. In 2012, the filmmaker Emir Kusturica and Bosnian Serb President Milorad Dodik unveiled another statue of Andrić in Višegrad, this time as part of the construction of an ethno-town called Andrićgrad, sponsored by Kusturica and the Government of Republika Srpska. Andrićgrad was officially inaugurated in June 2014, on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the assassination of Franz Ferdinand.

Starting in the early 1990s, Andrić&#x27;s likeness began to appear on the banknotes of the Yugoslav dinar. His likeness is also featured on 1KM banknotes that were issued in Republika Srpska and 200KM banknotes that were issued at the national level in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as 20 dinar coins minted by Serbia in 2011 to mark the fiftieth anniversary of his being awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.

<doc id="55017" wikidata="Q641442" url="?curid=55017" title="Fusion power">
<text>Fusion power is a proposed form of power generation that would generate electricity by using heat from nuclear fusion reactions. In a fusion process, two lighter atomic nuclei combine to form a heavier nucleus, while releasing energy. Devices designed to harness this energy are known as fusion reactors. Research into fusion reactors began in the 1940s, but as of 2024, no device has reached net power, although net positive reactions have been achieved.

Fusion processes require fuel, in a state of plasma, and a confined environment with sufficient temperature, pressure, and confinement time. The combination of these parameters that results in a power-producing system is known as the Lawson criterion. In stellar cores the most common fuel is the lightest isotope of hydrogen (protium), and gravity provides the conditions needed for fusion energy production. Proposed fusion reactors would use the heavy hydrogen isotopes of deuterium and tritium for DT fusion, for which the Lawson criterion is known to be easiest to achieve. This produces a helium nucleus and an energetic neutron. Most designs aim to heat their fuel to around 100 million kelvins, which presents a major challenge in producing a successful design. Fusion fuel is 10 million times more energy dense than coal, but tritium is extremely rare on Earth, having a half life of only ~12.3 years. Consequently, during the operation of envisioned fusion reactors, breeding blankets are subjected to neutron fluxes to generate tritium to complete the fuel cycle. 

As a source of power, nuclear fusion has a number of potential advantages compared to fission. These include little high-level waste, and increased safety. However, the necessary combination of temperature, pressure, and duration has proven to be difficult to produce in a practical and economical manner. A second issue that affects common reactions is managing resulting neutron radiation, which over time degrade the reaction chamber, especially the first wall.

Fusion researchers have investigated various confinement concepts. The early emphasis was on three main systems: z-pinch, stellarator, and magnetic mirror. The current leading designs are the tokamak and inertial confinement (ICF) by laser. Both designs are under research at very large scales, most notably the ITER tokamak in France and the National Ignition Facility (NIF) laser in the United States. Researchers are also studying other designs that may offer less expensive approaches. Among these alternatives, there is increasing interest in magnetized target fusion and inertial electrostatic confinement, and new variations of the stellarator.

== Background ==


=== Mechanism ===
Fusion reactions occur when two or more atomic nuclei come close enough for long enough that the nuclear force pulling them together exceeds the electrostatic force pushing them apart, fusing them into heavier nuclei. For nuclei heavier than iron-56, the reaction is endothermic, requiring an input of energy. The heavy nuclei bigger than iron have many more protons resulting in a greater repulsive force. For nuclei lighter than iron-56, the reaction is exothermic, releasing energy when they fuse. Since hydrogen has a single proton in its nucleus, it requires the least effort to attain fusion, and yields the most net energy output. Also since it has one electron, hydrogen is the easiest fuel to fully ionize.

The repulsive electrostatic interaction between nuclei operates across larger distances than the strong force, which has a range of roughly one femtometer—the diameter of a proton or neutron. The fuel atoms must be supplied enough kinetic energy to approach one another closely enough for the strong force to overcome the electrostatic repulsion in order to initiate fusion. The &quot;Coulomb barrier&quot; is the quantity of kinetic energy required to move the fuel atoms near enough. Atoms can be heated to extremely high temperatures or accelerated in a particle accelerator to produce this energy.

An atom loses its electrons once it is heated past its ionization energy. An ion is the name for the resultant bare nucleus. The result of this ionization is plasma, which is a heated cloud of ions and free electrons that were formerly bound to them. Plasmas are electrically conducting and magnetically controlled because the charges are separated. This is used by several fusion devices to confine the hot particles.

=== Cross section ===
A reaction&#x27;s cross section, denoted σ, measures the probability that a fusion reaction will happen. This depends on the relative velocity of the two nuclei. Higher relative velocities generally increase the probability, but the probability begins to decrease again at very high energies.

In a plasma, particle velocity can be characterized using a probability distribution. If the plasma is thermalized, the distribution looks like a Gaussian curve, or Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution. In this case, it is useful to use the average particle cross section over the velocity distribution. This is entered into the volumetric fusion rate:

:formula_1

where:

* formula_2 is the energy made by fusion, per time and volume
* &quot;n&quot; is the number density of species A or B, of the particles in the volume
* formula_3 is the cross section of that reaction, average over all the velocities of the two species &quot;v&quot;
* formula_4 is the energy released by that fusion reaction.

=== Lawson criterion ===
The Lawson criterion considers the energy balance between the energy produced in fusion reactions to the energy being lost to the environment. In order to generate usable energy, a system would have to produce more energy than it loses. Lawson assumed an energy balance, shown below.

:formula_5
where:
* formula_6 is the net power from fusion
* formula_7 is the efficiency of capturing the output of the fusion
* formula_2 is the rate of energy generated by the fusion reactions
* formula_9 is the conduction losses as energetic mass leaves the plasma
* formula_10 is the radiation losses as energy leaves as light and neutron flux.

The rate of fusion, and thus Pfusion, depends on the temperature and density of the plasma. The plasma loses energy through conduction and radiation. Conduction occurs when ions, electrons, or neutrals impact other substances, typically a surface of the device, and transfer a portion of their kinetic energy to the other atoms. The rate of conduction is also based on the temperature and density. Radiation is energy that leaves the cloud as light. Radiation also increases with temperature as well as the mass of the ions. Fusion power systems must operate in a region where the rate of fusion is higher than the losses.

=== Triple product: density, temperature, time ===

The Lawson criterion argues that a machine holding a thermalized and quasi-neutral plasma has to generate enough energy to overcome its energy losses. The amount of energy released in a given volume is a function of the temperature, and thus the reaction rate on a per-particle basis, the density of particles within that volume, and finally the confinement time, the length of time that energy stays within the volume. This is known as the &quot;triple product&quot;: the plasma density, temperature, and confinement time.

In magnetic confinement, the density is low, on the order of a &quot;good vacuum&quot;. For instance, in the ITER device the fuel density is about , which is about one-millionth atmospheric density. This means that the temperature and/or confinement time must increase. Fusion-relevant temperatures have been achieved using a variety of heating methods that were developed in the early 1970s. In modern machines, , the major remaining issue was the confinement time. Plasmas in strong magnetic fields are subject to a number of inherent instabilities, which must be suppressed to reach useful durations. One way to do this is to simply make the reactor volume larger, which reduces the rate of leakage due to classical diffusion. This is why ITER is so large.

In contrast, inertial confinement systems approach useful triple product values via higher density, and have short confinement intervals. In NIF, the initial frozen hydrogen fuel load has a density less than water that is increased to about 100 times the density of lead. In these conditions, the rate of fusion is so high that the fuel fuses in the microseconds it takes for the heat generated by the reactions to blow the fuel apart. Although NIF is also large, this is a function of its &quot;driver&quot; design, not inherent to the fusion process.

=== Energy capture ===
Multiple approaches have been proposed to capture the energy that fusion produces. The simplest is to heat a fluid. The commonly targeted D-T reaction releases much of its energy as fast-moving neutrons. Electrically neutral, the neutron is unaffected by the confinement scheme. In most designs, it is captured in a thick &quot;blanket&quot; of lithium surrounding the reactor core. When struck by a high-energy neutron, the blanket heats up. It is then actively cooled with a working fluid that drives a turbine to produce power.

Another design proposed to use the neutrons to breed fission fuel in a blanket of nuclear waste, a concept known as a fission-fusion hybrid. In these systems, the power output is enhanced by the fission events, and power is extracted using systems like those in conventional fission reactors.

Designs that use other fuels, notably the proton-boron aneutronic fusion reaction, release much more of their energy in the form of charged particles. In these cases, power extraction systems based on the movement of these charges are possible. Direct energy conversion was developed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) in the 1980s as a method to maintain a voltage directly using fusion reaction products. This has demonstrated energy capture efficiency of 48 percent.

== Plasma behavior ==
Plasma is an ionized gas that conducts electricity. In bulk, it is modeled using magnetohydrodynamics, which is a combination of the Navier–Stokes equations governing fluids and Maxwell&#x27;s equations governing how magnetic and electric fields behave. Fusion exploits several plasma properties, including:
* Self-organizing plasma conducts electric and magnetic fields. Its motions generate fields that can in turn contain it.
* Diamagnetic plasma can generate its own internal magnetic field. This can reject an externally applied magnetic field, making it diamagnetic.
* Magnetic mirrors can reflect plasma when it moves from a low to high density field.:24

== Methods ==
=== Magnetic confinement ===

* Tokamak: the most well-developed and well-funded approach. This method drives hot plasma around in a magnetically confined torus, with an internal current. When completed, ITER will become the world&#x27;s largest tokamak. As of September 2018 an estimated 226 experimental tokamaks were either planned, decommissioned or operating (50) worldwide.
* Spherical tokamak: also known as spherical torus. A variation on the tokamak with a spherical shape.
* Stellarator: Twisted rings of hot plasma. The stellarator attempts to create a natural twisted plasma path, using external magnets. Stellarators were developed by Lyman Spitzer in 1950 and evolved into four designs: Torsatron, Heliotron, Heliac and Helias. One example is Wendelstein 7-X, a German device. It is the world&#x27;s largest stellarator.
* Internal rings: Stellarators create a twisted plasma using external magnets, while tokamaks do so using a current induced in the plasma. Several classes of designs provide this twist using conductors inside the plasma. Early calculations showed that collisions between the plasma and the supports for the conductors would remove energy faster than fusion reactions could replace it. Modern variations, including the Levitated Dipole Experiment (LDX), use a solid superconducting torus that is magnetically levitated inside the reactor chamber.
* Magnetic mirror: Developed by Richard F. Post and teams at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) in the 1960s. Magnetic mirrors reflect plasma back and forth in a line. Variations included the Tandem Mirror, magnetic bottle and the biconic cusp. A series of mirror machines were built by the US government in the 1970s and 1980s, principally at LLNL. However, calculations in the 1970s estimated it was unlikely these would ever be commercially useful.
* Bumpy torus: A number of magnetic mirrors are arranged end-to-end in a toroidal ring. Any fuel ions that leak out of one are confined in a neighboring mirror, permitting the plasma pressure to be raised arbitrarily high without loss. An experimental facility, the ELMO Bumpy Torus or EBT was built and tested at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in the 1970s.
* Field-reversed configuration: This device traps plasma in a self-organized quasi-stable structure; where the particle motion makes an internal magnetic field which then traps itself.
* Spheromak: Similar to a field-reversed configuration, a semi-stable plasma structure made by using the plasmas&#x27; self-generated magnetic field. A spheromak has both toroidal and poloidal fields, while a field-reversed configuration has no toroidal field.
* Dynomak is a spheromak that is formed and sustained using continuous magnetic flux injection. 
* Reversed field pinch: Here the plasma moves inside a ring. It has an internal magnetic field. Moving out from the center of this ring, the magnetic field reverses direction.

=== Inertial confinement ===

* Indirect drive: Lasers heat a structure known as a Hohlraum that becomes so hot it begins to radiate x-ray light. These x-rays heat a fuel pellet, causing it to collapse inward to compress the fuel. The largest system using this method is the National Ignition Facility, followed closely by Laser Mégajoule.
* Direct drive: Lasers directly heat the fuel pellet. Notable direct drive experiments have been conducted at the Laboratory for Laser Energetics (LLE) and the GEKKO XII facilities. Good implosions require fuel pellets with close to a perfect shape in order to generate a symmetrical inward shock wave that produces the high-density plasma.
* Fast ignition: This method uses two laser blasts. The first blast compresses the fusion fuel, while the second ignites it. this technique had lost favor for energy production.
* Magneto-inertial fusion or Magnetized Liner Inertial Fusion: This combines a laser pulse with a magnetic pinch. The pinch community refers to it as magnetized liner inertial fusion while the ICF community refers to it as magneto-inertial fusion.
* Ion Beams: Ion beams replace laser beams to heat the fuel. The main difference is that the beam has momentum due to mass, whereas lasers do not. As of 2019 it appears unlikely that ion beams can be sufficiently focused spatially and in time.
* Z-machine: Sends an electric current through thin tungsten wires, heating them sufficiently to generate x-rays. Like the indirect drive approach, these x-rays then compress a fuel capsule.

=== Magnetic or electric pinches ===
* &quot;Z-pinch:&quot; A current travels in the z-direction through the plasma. The current generates a magnetic field that compresses the plasma. Pinches were the first method for human-made controlled fusion. The z-pinch has inherent instabilities that limit its compression and heating to values too low for practical fusion. The largest such machine, the UK&#x27;s ZETA, was the last major experiment of the sort. The problems in z-pinch led to the tokamak design. The dense plasma focus is a possibly superior variation.
* &quot;Theta-pinch:&quot; A current circles around the outside of a plasma column, in the theta direction. This induces a magnetic field running down the center of the plasma, as opposed to around it. The early theta-pinch device Scylla was the first to conclusively demonstrate fusion, but later work demonstrated it had inherent limits that made it uninteresting for power production.
* &quot;Sheared Flow Stabilized Z-Pinch:&quot; Research at the University of Washington under Uri Shumlak investigated the use of sheared-flow stabilization to smooth out the instabilities of Z-pinch reactors. This involves accelerating neutral gas along the axis of the pinch. Experimental machines included the FuZE and Zap Flow Z-Pinch experimental reactors. In 2017, British technology investor and entrepreneur Benj Conway, together with physicists Brian Nelson and Uri Shumlak, co-founded Zap Energy to attempt to commercialize the technology for power production.
* &quot;Screw Pinch:&quot; This method combines a theta and z-pinch for improved stabilization.

=== Inertial electrostatic confinement ===
* &quot;Fusor:&quot; An electric field heats ions to fusion conditions. The machine typically uses two spherical cages, a cathode inside the anode, inside a vacuum. These machines are not considered a viable approach to net power because of their high conduction and radiation losses. They are simple enough to build that amateurs have fused atoms using them.
* &quot;Polywell:&quot; Attempts to combine magnetic confinement with electrostatic fields, to avoid the conduction losses generated by the cage.

=== Other ===
* &quot;Magnetized target fusion:&quot; Confines hot plasma using a magnetic field and squeezes it using inertia. Examples include LANL FRX-L machine, General Fusion (piston compression with liquid metal liner), HyperJet Fusion (plasma jet compression with plasma liner).
* &quot;Uncontrolled:&quot; Fusion has been initiated by man, using uncontrolled fission explosions to stimulate fusion. Early proposals for fusion power included using bombs to initiate reactions. See Project PACER.
* &quot;Colliding beam fusion:&quot; A beam of high energy particles fired at another beam or target can initiate fusion. This was used in the 1970s and 1980s to study the cross sections of fusion reactions. However beam systems cannot be used for power because keeping a beam coherent takes more energy than comes from fusion.
* &quot;Muon-catalyzed fusion:&quot; This approach replaces electrons in diatomic molecules of isotopes of hydrogen with muons—more massive particles with the same electric charge. Their greater mass compresses the nuclei enough such that the strong interaction can cause fusion. As of 2007 producing muons required more energy than can be obtained from muon-catalyzed fusion.
* &quot;Lattice confinement fusion:&quot; Lattice confinement fusion (LCF) is a type of nuclear fusion in which deuteron-saturated metals are exposed to gamma radiation or ion beams, such as in an IEC fusor, avoiding the confined high-temperature plasmas used in other methods of fusion.

== Common tools ==
Many approaches, equipment, and mechanisms are employed across multiple projects to address fusion heating, measurement, and power production.

=== Machine learning ===
A deep reinforcement learning system has been used to control a tokamak-based reactor. The system was able to manipulate the magnetic coils to manage the plasma. The system was able to continuously adjust to maintain appropriate behavior (more complex than step-based systems). In 2014, Google began working with California-based fusion company TAE Technologies to control the Joint European Torus (JET) to predict plasma behavior. DeepMind has also developed a control scheme with TCV.

=== Heating ===
* Electrostatic heating: an electric field can do work on charged ions or electrons, heating them.
* Neutral beam injection: hydrogen is ionized and accelerated by an electric field to form a charged beam that is shone through a source of neutral hydrogen gas towards the plasma which itself is ionized and contained by a magnetic field. Some of the intermediate hydrogen gas is accelerated towards the plasma by collisions with the charged beam while remaining neutral: this neutral beam is thus unaffected by the magnetic field and so reaches the plasma. Once inside the plasma the neutral beam transmits energy to the plasma by collisions which ionize it and allow it to be contained by the magnetic field, thereby both heating and refueling the reactor in one operation. The remainder of the charged beam is diverted by magnetic fields onto cooled beam dumps.
* Radio frequency heating: a radio wave causes the plasma to oscillate (i.e., microwave oven). This is also known as electron cyclotron resonance heating, using for example gyrotrons, or dielectric heating.
* Magnetic reconnection: when plasma gets dense, its electromagnetic properties can change, which can lead to magnetic reconnection. Reconnection helps fusion because it instantly dumps energy into a plasma, heating it quickly. Up to 45% of the magnetic field energy can heat the ions.
* Magnetic oscillations: varying electric currents can be supplied to magnetic coils that heat plasma confined within a magnetic wall.
* Antiproton annihilation: antiprotons injected into a mass of fusion fuel can induce thermonuclear reactions. This possibility as a method of spacecraft propulsion, known as antimatter-catalyzed nuclear pulse propulsion, was investigated at Pennsylvania State University in connection with the proposed AIMStar project.

=== Measurement ===
The diagnostics of a fusion scientific reactor are extremely complex and varied. The diagnostics required for a fusion power reactor will be various but less complicated than those of a scientific reactor as by the time of commercialization, many real-time feedback and control diagnostics will have been perfected. However, the operating environment of a commercial fusion reactor will be harsher for diagnostic systems than in a scientific reactor because continuous operations may involve higher plasma temperatures and higher levels of neutron irradiation. In many proposed approaches, commercialization will require the additional ability to measure and separate diverter gases, for example helium and impurities, and to monitor fuel breeding, for instance the state of a tritium breeding liquid lithium liner. The following are some basic techniques.
* Flux loop: a loop of wire is inserted into the magnetic field. As the field passes through the loop, a current is made. The current measures the total magnetic flux through that loop. This has been used on the National Compact Stellarator Experiment, the polywell, and the LDX machines. A Langmuir probe, a metal object placed in a plasma, can be employed. A potential is applied to it, giving it a voltage against the surrounding plasma. The metal collects charged particles, drawing a current. As the voltage changes, the current changes. This makes an IV Curve. The IV-curve can be used to determine the local plasma density, potential and temperature.
* Thomson scattering: &quot;Light scatters&quot; from plasma can be used to reconstruct plasma behavior, including density and temperature. It is common in Inertial confinement fusion, Tokamaks, and fusors. In ICF systems, firing a second beam into a gold foil adjacent to the target makes x-rays that traverse the plasma. In tokamaks, this can be done using mirrors and detectors to reflect light.
* Neutron detectors: Several types of neutron detectors can record the rate at which neutrons are produced.
* X-ray detectors Visible, IR, UV, and X-rays are emitted anytime a particle changes velocity. If the reason is deflection by a magnetic field, the radiation is cyclotron radiation at low speeds and synchrotron radiation at high speeds. If the reason is deflection by another particle, plasma radiates X-rays, known as Bremsstrahlung radiation.

=== Power production ===
Neutron blankets absorb neutrons, which heats the blanket. Power can be extracted from the blanket in various ways:

* Steam turbines can be driven by heat transferred into a working fluid that turns into steam, driving electric generators.
* Neutron blankets: These neutrons can regenerate spent fission fuel. Tritium can be produced using a breeder blanket of liquid lithium or a helium cooled pebble bed made of lithium-bearing ceramic pebbles.
* Direct conversion: The kinetic energy of a particle can be converted into voltage. It was first suggested by Richard F. Post in conjunction with magnetic mirrors, in the late 1960s. It has been proposed for Field-Reversed Configurations as well as Dense Plasma Focus devices. The process converts a large fraction of the random energy of the fusion products into directed motion. The particles are then collected on electrodes at various large electrical potentials. This method has demonstrated an experimental efficiency of 48 percent.
* Traveling-wave tubes pass charged helium atoms at several megavolts and just coming off the fusion reaction through a tube with a coil of wire around the outside. This passing charge at high voltage pulls electricity through the wire.

=== Confinement ===
Confinement refers to all the conditions necessary to keep a plasma dense and hot long enough to undergo fusion. General principles:

* Equilibrium: The forces acting on the plasma must be balanced. One exception is inertial confinement, where the fusion must occur faster than the dispersal time.
* Stability: The plasma must be constructed so that disturbances will not lead to the plasma dispersing.
* Transport or conduction: The loss of material must be sufficiently slow. The plasma carries energy off with it, so rapid loss of material will disrupt fusion. Material can be lost by transport into different regions or conduction through a solid or liquid.

To produce self-sustaining fusion, part of the energy released by the reaction must be used to heat new reactants and maintain the conditions for fusion.

==== Magnetic confinement ====
===== Magnetic Mirror =====
Magnetic mirror effect. If a particle follows the field line and enters a region of higher field strength, the particles can be reflected. Several devices apply this effect. The most famous was the magnetic mirror machines, a series of devices built at LLNL from the 1960s to the 1980s. Other examples include magnetic bottles and Biconic cusp. Because the mirror machines were straight, they had some advantages over ring-shaped designs. The mirrors were easier to construct and maintain and direct conversion energy capture was easier to implement. Poor confinement has led this approach to be abandoned, except in the polywell design.

===== Magnetic loops =====
Magnetic loops bend the field lines back on themselves, either in circles or more commonly in nested toroidal surfaces. The most highly developed systems of this type are the tokamak, the stellarator, and the reversed field pinch. Compact toroids, especially the field-reversed configuration and the spheromak, attempt to combine the advantages of toroidal magnetic surfaces with those of a simply connected (non-toroidal) machine, resulting in a mechanically simpler and smaller confinement area.

==== Inertial confinement ====
Inertial confinement is the use of rapid implosion to heat and confine plasma. A shell surrounding the fuel is imploded using a direct laser blast (direct drive), a secondary x-ray blast (indirect drive), or heavy beams. The fuel must be compressed to about 30 times solid density with energetic beams. Direct drive can in principle be efficient, but insufficient uniformity has prevented success.:19–20 Indirect drive uses beams to heat a shell, driving the shell to radiate x-rays, which then implode the pellet. The beams are commonly laser beams, but ion and electron beams have been investigated.:182–193

===== Electrostatic confinement =====
Electrostatic confinement fusion devices use electrostatic fields. The best known is the fusor. This device has a cathode inside an anode wire cage. Positive ions fly towards the negative inner cage, and are heated by the electric field in the process. If they miss the inner cage they can collide and fuse. Ions typically hit the cathode, however, creating prohibitory high conduction losses. Fusion rates in fusors are low because of competing physical effects, such as energy loss in the form of light radiation. Designs have been proposed to avoid the problems associated with the cage, by generating the field using a non-neutral cloud. These include a plasma oscillating device, a magnetically shielded-grid, a penning trap, the polywell, and the F1 cathode driver concept.

== Fuels ==
The fuels considered for fusion power have all been light elements like the isotopes of hydrogen—protium, deuterium, and tritium. The deuterium and helium-3 reaction requires helium-3, an isotope of helium so scarce on Earth that it would have to be mined extraterrestrially or produced by other nuclear reactions. Ultimately, researchers hope to adopt the protium–boron-11 reaction, because it does not directly produce neutrons, although side reactions can.

=== Deuterium, tritium ===
The easiest nuclear reaction, at the lowest energy, is D+T:

: + → (3.5 MeV) + (14.1 MeV)

This reaction is common in research, industrial and military applications, usually as a neutron source. Deuterium is a naturally occurring isotope of hydrogen and is commonly available. The large mass ratio of the hydrogen isotopes makes their separation easy compared to the uranium enrichment process. Tritium is a natural isotope of hydrogen, but because it has a short half-life of 12.32 years, it is hard to find, store, produce, and is expensive. Consequently, the deuterium-tritium fuel cycle requires the breeding of tritium from lithium using one of the following reactions:
: + → + + 

The reactant neutron is supplied by the D-T fusion reaction shown above, and the one that has the greatest energy yield. The reaction with 6Li is exothermic, providing a small energy gain for the reactor. The reaction with 7Li is endothermic, but does not consume the neutron. Neutron multiplication reactions are required to replace the neutrons lost to absorption by other elements. Leading candidate neutron multiplication materials are beryllium and lead, but the 7Li reaction helps to keep the neutron population high. Natural lithium is mainly 7Li, which has a low tritium production cross section compared to 6Li so most reactor designs use breeding blankets with enriched 6Li.

Drawbacks commonly attributed to D-T fusion power include:

* The supply of neutrons results in neutron activation of the reactor materials.:242
* 80% of the resultant energy is carried off by neutrons, which limits the use of direct energy conversion.
* It requires the radioisotope tritium. Tritium may leak from reactors. Some estimates suggest that this would represent a substantial environmental radioactivity release.

The neutron flux expected in a commercial D-T fusion reactor is about 100 times that of fission power reactors, posing problems for material design. After a series of D-T tests at JET, the vacuum vessel was sufficiently radioactive that it required remote handling for the year following the tests.

In a production setting, the neutrons would react with lithium in the breeding blanket composed of lithium ceramic pebbles or liquid lithium, yielding tritium. The energy of the neutrons ends up in the lithium, which would then be transferred to drive electrical production. The lithium blanket protects the outer portions of the reactor from the neutron flux. Newer designs, the advanced tokamak in particular, use lithium inside the reactor core as a design element. The plasma interacts directly with the lithium, preventing a problem known as &quot;recycling&quot;. The advantage of this design was demonstrated in the Lithium Tokamak Experiment.

=== Deuterium ===
Fusing two deuterium nuclei is the second easiest fusion reaction. The reaction has two branches that occur with nearly equal probability:
: + → + 

This reaction is also common in research. The optimum energy to initiate this reaction is 15 keV, only slightly higher than that for the D-T reaction. The first branch produces tritium, so that a D-D reactor is not tritium-free, even though it does not require an input of tritium or lithium. Unless the tritons are quickly removed, most of the tritium produced is burned in the reactor, which reduces the handling of tritium, with the disadvantage of producing more, and higher-energy, neutrons. The neutron from the second branch of the D-D reaction has an energy of only , while the neutron from the D-T reaction has an energy of , resulting in greater isotope production and material damage. When the tritons are removed quickly while allowing the 3He to react, the fuel cycle is called &quot;tritium suppressed fusion&quot;. The removed tritium decays to 3He with a 12.5 year half life. By recycling the 3He decay into the reactor, the fusion reactor does not require materials resistant to fast neutrons.

Assuming complete tritium burn-up, the reduction in the fraction of fusion energy carried by neutrons would be only about 18%, so that the primary advantage of the D-D fuel cycle is that tritium breeding is not required. Other advantages are independence from lithium resources and a somewhat softer neutron spectrum. The disadvantage of D-D compared to D-T is that the energy confinement time (at a given pressure) must be 30 times longer and the power produced (at a given pressure and volume) is 68 times less.

Assuming complete removal of tritium and 3He recycling, only 6% of the fusion energy is carried by neutrons. The tritium-suppressed D-D fusion requires an energy confinement that is 10 times longer compared to D-T and double the plasma temperature.

=== Deuterium, helium-3 ===
A second-generation approach to controlled fusion power involves combining helium-3 (3He) and deuterium (2H):

This reaction produces 4He and a high-energy proton. As with the p-11B aneutronic fusion fuel cycle, most of the reaction energy is released as charged particles, reducing activation of the reactor housing and potentially allowing more efficient energy harvesting (via any of several pathways). In practice, D-D side reactions produce a significant number of neutrons, leaving p-11B as the preferred cycle for aneutronic fusion.

=== Proton, boron-11 ===
Both material science problems and non-proliferation concerns are greatly diminished by aneutronic fusion. Theoretically, the most reactive aneutronic fuel is 3He. However, obtaining reasonable quantities of 3He implies large scale extraterrestrial mining on the Moon or in the atmosphere of Uranus or Saturn. Therefore, the most promising candidate fuel for such fusion is fusing the readily available protium (i.e. a proton) and boron. Their fusion releases no neutrons, but produces energetic charged alpha (helium) particles whose energy can directly be converted to electrical power:

: + → 3 

Side reactions are likely to yield neutrons that carry only about 0.1% of the power,:177–182 which means that neutron scattering is not used for energy transfer and material activation is reduced several thousand-fold. The optimum temperature for this reaction of 123 keV is nearly ten times higher than that for pure hydrogen reactions, and energy confinement must be 500 times better than that required for the D-T reaction. In addition, the power density is 2500 times lower than for D-T, although per unit mass of fuel, this is still considerably higher compared to fission reactors.

Because the confinement properties of the tokamak and laser pellet fusion are marginal, most proposals for aneutronic fusion are based on radically different confinement concepts, such as the Polywell and the Dense Plasma Focus. In 2013, a research team led by Christine Labaune at École Polytechnique, reported a new fusion rate record for proton-boron fusion, with an estimated 80 million fusion reactions during a 1.5 nanosecond laser fire, 100 times greater than reported in previous experiments.

== Material selection ==
Structural material stability is a critical issue. Materials that can survive the high temperatures and neutron bombardment experienced in a fusion reactor are considered key to success. The principal issues are the conditions generated by the plasma, neutron degradation of wall surfaces, and the related issue of plasma-wall surface conditions. Reducing hydrogen permeability is seen as crucial to hydrogen recycling and control of the tritium inventory. Materials with the lowest bulk hydrogen solubility and diffusivity provide the optimal candidates for stable barriers. A few pure metals, including tungsten and beryllium, and compounds such as carbides, dense oxides, and nitrides have been investigated. Research has highlighted that coating techniques for preparing well-adhered and perfect barriers are of equivalent importance. The most attractive techniques are those in which an ad-layer is formed by oxidation alone. Alternative methods utilize specific gas environments with strong magnetic and electric fields. Assessment of barrier performance represents an additional challenge. Classical coated membranes gas permeation continues to be the most reliable method to determine hydrogen permeation barrier (HPB) efficiency. In 2021, in response to increasing numbers of designs for fusion power reactors for 2040, the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority published the UK Fusion Materials Roadmap 2021–2040, focusing on five priority areas, with a focus on tokamak family reactors:

* Novel materials to minimize the amount of activation in the structure of the fusion power plant;
* Compounds that can be used within the power plant to optimise breeding of tritium fuel to sustain the fusion process;
* Magnets and insulators that are resistant to irradiation from fusion reactions—especially under cryogenic conditions;
* Structural materials able to retain their strength under neutron bombardment at high operating temperatures (over 550 degrees C);
* Engineering assurance for fusion materials—providing irradiated sample data and modelled predictions such that plant designers, operators and regulators have confidence that materials are suitable for use in future commercial power stations.

=== Superconducting materials ===
In a plasma that is embedded in a magnetic field (known as a magnetized plasma) the fusion rate scales as the magnetic field strength to the 4th power. For this reason, many fusion companies that rely on magnetic fields to control their plasma are trying to develop high temperature superconducting devices. In 2021, SuperOx, a Russian and Japanese company, developed a new manufacturing process for making superconducting YBCO wire for fusion reactors. This new wire was shown to conduct between 700 and 2000 Amps per square millimeter. The company was able to produce 186 miles of wire in nine months.

=== Containment considerations ===
Even on smaller production scales, the containment apparatus is blasted with matter and energy. Designs for plasma containment must consider:

* A heating and cooling cycle, up to a 10 MW/m2 thermal load.
* Neutron radiation, which over time leads to neutron activation and embrittlement.
* High energy ions leaving at tens to hundreds of electronvolts.
* Alpha particles leaving at millions of electronvolts.
* Electrons leaving at high energy.
* Light radiation (IR, visible, UV, X-ray).

Depending on the approach, these effects may be higher or lower than fission reactors. One estimate put the radiation at 100 times that of a typical pressurized water reactor. Depending on the approach, other considerations such as electrical conductivity, magnetic permeability, and mechanical strength matter. Materials must also not end up as long-lived radioactive waste.

=== Plasma-wall surface conditions ===
For long term use, each atom in the wall is expected to be hit by a neutron and displaced about 100 times before the material is replaced. These high-energy neutron collisions with the atoms in the wall result in the absorption of the neutrons, forming unstable isotopes of the atoms. When the isotope decays, it may emit alpha particles, protons, or gamma rays. Alpha particles, once stabilized by capturing electrons, form helium atoms which accumulate at grain boundaries and may result in swelling, blistering, or embrittlement of the material.

=== Selection of materials ===
Tungsten is widely regarded as the optimal material for plasma-facing components in next-generation fusion devices due to its unique properties and potential for enhancements. Its low sputtering rates and high melting point make it particularly suitable for the high-stress environments of fusion reactors, allowing it to withstand intense conditions without rapid degradation. Additionally, tungsten&#x27;s low tritium retention through co-deposition and implantation is essential in fusion contexts, as it helps to minimize the accumulation of this radioactive isotope.

Liquid metals (lithium, gallium, tin) have been proposed, e.g., by injection of 1–5 mm thick streams flowing at 10 m/s on solid substrates.

Graphite features a gross erosion rate due to physical and chemical sputtering amounting to many meters per year, requiring redeposition of the sputtered material. The redeposition site generally does not exactly match the sputter site, allowing net erosion that may be prohibitive. An even larger problem is that tritium is redeposited with the redeposited graphite. The tritium inventory in the wall and dust could build up to many kilograms, representing a waste of resources and a radiological hazard in case of an accident. Graphite found favor as material for short-lived experiments, but appears unlikely to become the primary plasma-facing material (PFM) in a commercial reactor.

Ceramic materials such as silicon carbide (SiC) have similar issues like graphite. Tritium retention in silicon carbide plasma-facing components is approximately 1.5-2 times higher than in graphite, resulting in reduced fuel efficiency and heightened safety risks in fusion reactors. SiC tends to trap more tritium, limiting its availability for fusion and increasing the risk of hazardous accumulation, complicating tritium management. Furthermore, the chemical and physical sputtering of SiC remains significant, contributing to tritium buildup through co-deposition over time and with increasing particle fluence. As a result, carbon-based materials have been excluded from ITER, DEMO, and similar devices. 

Tungsten&#x27;s sputtering rate is orders of magnitude smaller than carbon&#x27;s, and tritium is much less incorporated into redeposited tungsten. However, tungsten plasma impurities are much more damaging than carbon impurities, and self-sputtering can be high, requiring the plasma in contact with the tungsten not be too hot (a few tens of eV rather than hundreds of eV). Tungsten also has issues around eddy currents and melting in off-normal events, as well as some radiological issues.

Recent advances in materials for containment apparatus materials have found that certain ceramics can actually improve the longevity of the material of the containment apparatus. Studies on MAX phases, such as titanium silicon carbide, show that under the high operating temperatures of nuclear fusion, the material undergoes a phase transformation from a hexagonal structure to a face-centered-cubic (FCC) structure, driven by helium bubble growth. Helium atoms preferentially accumulate in the Si layer of the hexagonal structure, as the Si atoms are more mobile than the Ti-C slabs. As more atoms are trapped, the Ti-C slab is peeled off, causing the Si atoms to become highly mobile interstitial atoms in the new FCC structure. Lattice strain induced by the He bubbles cause Si atoms to diffuse out of compressive areas, typically towards the surface of the material, forming a protective silicon dioxide layer.

Doping vessel materials with iron silicate has emerged as a promising approach to enhance containment materials in fusion reactors, as well. This method targets helium embrittlement at grain boundaries, a common issue that arises as helium atoms accumulate and form bubbles. Over time, these bubbles coalesce at grain boundaries, causing them to expand and degrade the material&#x27;s structural integrity. By contrast, introducing iron silicate creates nucleation sites within the metal matrix that are more thermodynamically favorable for helium aggregation. This localized congregation around iron silicate nanoparticles induces matrix strain rather than weakening grain boundaries, preserving the material’s strength and longevity.

== Safety and the environment ==
=== Accident potential ===
Accident potential and effect on the environment are critical to social acceptance of nuclear fusion, also known as a social license. Fusion reactors are not subject to catastrophic meltdown. It requires precise and controlled temperature, pressure and magnetic field parameters to produce net energy, and any damage or loss of required control would rapidly quench the reaction. Fusion reactors operate with seconds or even microseconds worth of fuel at any moment. Without active refueling, the reactions immediately quench.

The same constraints prevent runaway reactions. Although the plasma is expected to have a volume of or more, the plasma typically contains only a few grams of fuel. By comparison, a fission reactor is typically loaded with enough fuel for months or years, and no additional fuel is necessary to continue the reaction. This large fuel supply is what offers the possibility of a meltdown.

In magnetic containment, strong fields develop in coils that are mechanically held in place by the reactor structure. Failure of this structure could release this tension and allow the magnet to &quot;explode&quot; outward. The severity of this event would be similar to other industrial accidents or an MRI machine quench/explosion, and could be effectively contained within a containment building similar to those used in fission reactors.

In laser-driven inertial containment the larger size of the reaction chamber reduces the stress on materials. Although failure of the reaction chamber is possible, stopping fuel delivery prevents catastrophic failure.

Most reactor designs rely on liquid hydrogen as a coolant and to convert stray neutrons into tritium, which is fed back into the reactor as fuel. Hydrogen is flammable, and it is possible that hydrogen stored on-site could ignite. In this case, the tritium fraction of the hydrogen would enter the atmosphere, posing a radiation risk. Calculations suggest that about of tritium and other radioactive gases in a typical power station would be present. The amount is small enough that it would dilute to legally acceptable limits by the time they reached the station&#x27;s perimeter fence.

The likelihood of small industrial accidents, including the local release of radioactivity and injury to staff, are estimated to be minor compared to fission. They would include accidental releases of lithium or tritium or mishandling of radioactive reactor components.

=== Magnet quench ===
A magnet quench is an abnormal termination of magnet operation that occurs when part of the superconducting coil exits the superconducting state (becomes normal). This can occur because the field inside the magnet is too large, the rate of change of field is too large (causing eddy currents and resultant heating in the copper support matrix), or a combination of the two.

More rarely a magnet defect can cause a quench. When this happens, that particular spot is subject to rapid Joule heating from the current, which raises the temperature of the surrounding regions. This pushes those regions into the normal state as well, which leads to more heating in a chain reaction. The entire magnet rapidly becomes normal over several seconds, depending on the size of the superconducting coil. This is accompanied by a loud bang as the energy in the magnetic field is converted to heat, and the cryogenic fluid boils away. The abrupt decrease of current can result in kilovolt inductive voltage spikes and arcing. Permanent damage to the magnet is rare, but components can be damaged by localized heating, high voltages, or large mechanical forces.

In practice, magnets usually have safety devices to stop or limit the current when a quench is detected. If a large magnet undergoes a quench, the inert vapor formed by the evaporating cryogenic fluid can present a significant asphyxiation hazard to operators by displacing breathable air.

A large section of the superconducting magnets in CERN&#x27;s Large Hadron Collider unexpectedly quenched during start-up operations in 2008, destroying multiple magnets. In order to prevent a recurrence, the LHC&#x27;s superconducting magnets are equipped with fast-ramping heaters that are activated when a quench event is detected. The dipole bending magnets are connected in series. Each power circuit includes 154 individual magnets, and should a quench event occur, the entire combined stored energy of these magnets must be dumped at once. This energy is transferred into massive blocks of metal that heat up to several hundred degrees Celsius—because of resistive heating—in seconds. A magnet quench is a &quot;fairly routine event&quot; during the operation of a particle accelerator.

=== Effluents ===
The natural product of the fusion reaction is a small amount of helium, which is harmless to life. Hazardous tritium is difficult to retain completely.

Although tritium is volatile and biologically active, the health risk posed by a release is much lower than that of most radioactive contaminants, because of tritium&#x27;s short half-life (12.32 years) and very low decay energy (~14.95 keV), and because it does not bioaccumulate (it cycles out of the body as water, with a biological half-life of 7 to 14 days). ITER incorporates total containment facilities for tritium.

=== Radioactive waste ===
Fusion reactors create far less radioactive material than fission reactors. Further, the material it creates is less damaging biologically, and the radioactivity dissipates within a time period that is well within existing engineering capabilities for safe long-term waste storage. In specific terms, except in the case of aneutronic fusion, the neutron flux turns the structural materials radioactive. The amount of radioactive material at shut-down may be comparable to that of a fission reactor, with important differences. The half-lives of fusion and neutron activation radioisotopes tend to be less than those from fission, so that the hazard decreases more rapidly. Whereas fission reactors produce waste that remains radioactive for thousands of years, the radioactive material in a fusion reactor (other than tritium) would be the reactor core itself and most of this would be radioactive for about 50 years, with other low-level waste being radioactive for another 100 years or so thereafter. The fusion waste&#x27;s short half-life eliminates the challenge of long-term storage. By 500 years, the material would have the same radiotoxicity as coal ash.
Nonetheless, classification as intermediate level waste rather than low-level waste may complicate safety discussions.

The choice of materials is less constrained than in conventional fission, where many materials are required for their specific neutron cross-sections. Fusion reactors can be designed using &quot;low activation&quot;, materials that do not easily become radioactive. Vanadium, for example, becomes much less radioactive than stainless steel. Carbon fiber materials are also low-activation, are strong and light, and are promising for laser-inertial reactors where a magnetic field is not required.

=== Nuclear proliferation ===
In some scenarios, fusion power technology could be adapted to produce materials for military purposes. A huge amount of tritium could be produced by a fusion power station; tritium is used in the trigger of hydrogen bombs and in modern boosted fission weapons, but it can be produced in other ways. The energetic neutrons from a fusion reactor could be used to breed weapons-grade plutonium or uranium for an atomic bomb (for example by transmutation of to , or to ).

A study conducted in 2011 assessed three scenarios:
* Small-scale fusion station: As a result of much higher power consumption, heat dissipation and a more recognizable design compared to enrichment gas centrifuges, this choice would be much easier to detect and therefore implausible.
* Commercial facility: The production potential is significant. But no fertile or fissile substances necessary for the production of weapon-usable materials needs to be present at a civil fusion system at all. If not shielded, detection of these materials can be done by their characteristic gamma radiation. The underlying redesign could be detected by regular design information verification. In the (technically more feasible) case of solid breeder blanket modules, it would be necessary for incoming components to be inspected for the presence of fertile material, otherwise plutonium for several weapons could be produced each year.
* Prioritizing weapon-grade material regardless of secrecy: The fastest way to produce weapon-usable material was seen in modifying a civil fusion power station. No weapons-compatible material is required during civil use. Even without the need for covert action, such a modification would take about two months to start production and at least an additional week to generate a significant amount. This was considered to be enough time to detect a military use and to react with diplomatic or military means. To stop the production, a military destruction of parts of the facility while leaving out the reactor would be sufficient.

Another study concluded &quot;...large fusion reactors—even if not designed for fissile material breeding—could easily produce several hundred kg Pu per year with high weapon quality and very low source material requirements.&quot; It was emphasized that the implementation of features for intrinsic proliferation resistance might only be possible at an early phase of research and development. The theoretical and computational tools needed for hydrogen bomb design are closely related to those needed for inertial confinement fusion, but have very little in common with magnetic confinement fusion.

=== Fuel reserves ===
Fusion power commonly proposes the use of deuterium as fuel and many current designs also use lithium. Assuming a fusion energy output equal to the 1995 global power output of about 100 EJ/yr (= 1 × 1020 J/yr) and that this does not increase in the future, which is unlikely, then known current lithium reserves would last 3000 years. Lithium from sea water would last 60 million years, however, and a more complicated fusion process using only deuterium would have fuel for 150 billion years. To put this in context, 150 billion years is close to 30 times the remaining lifespan of the Sun, and more than 10 times the estimated age of the universe.

== Economics ==
The EU spent almost through the 1990s. ITER represents an investment of over twenty billion dollars, and possibly tens of billions more, including in kind contributions. Under the European Union&#x27;s Sixth Framework Programme, nuclear fusion research received (in addition to ITER funding), compared with for sustainable energy research, putting research into fusion power well ahead of that of any single rival technology. The United States Department of Energy has allocated $US367M–$US671M every year since 2010, peaking in 2020, with plans to reduce investment to $US425M in its FY2021 Budget Request. About a quarter of this budget is directed to support ITER.

The size of the investments and time lines meant that fusion research was traditionally almost exclusively publicly funded. However, starting in the 2010s, the promise of commercializing a paradigm-changing low-carbon energy source began to attract a raft of companies and investors. Over two dozen start-up companies attracted over one billion dollars from roughly 2000 to 2020, mainly from 2015, and a further three billion in funding and milestone related commitments in 2021, with investors including Jeff Bezos, Peter Thiel and Bill Gates, as well as institutional investors including Legal &amp; General, and energy companies including Equinor, Eni, Chevron, and the Chinese ENN Group. In 2021, Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) obtained $1.8 billion in scale-up funding, and Helion Energy obtained a half-billion dollars with an additional $1.7 billion contingent on meeting milestones.

Scenarios developed in the 2000s and early 2010s discussed the effects of the commercialization of fusion power on the future of human civilization. Using nuclear fission as a guide, these saw ITER and later DEMO as bringing online the first commercial reactors around 2050 and a rapid expansion after mid-century. Some scenarios emphasized &quot;fusion nuclear science facilities&quot; as a step beyond ITER. However, the economic obstacles to tokamak-based fusion power remain immense, requiring investment to fund prototype tokamak reactors and development of new supply chains, a problem which will affect any kind of fusion reactor. Tokamak designs appear to be labour-intensive, while the commercialization risk of alternatives like inertial fusion energy is high due to the lack of government resources.

Scenarios since 2010 note computing and material science advances enabling multi-phase national or cost-sharing &quot;Fusion Pilot Plants&quot; (FPPs) along various technology pathways, such as the UK Spherical Tokamak for Energy Production, within the 2030–2040 time frame. Notably, in June 2021, General Fusion announced it would accept the UK government&#x27;s offer to host the world&#x27;s first substantial public-private partnership fusion demonstration plant, at Culham Centre for Fusion Energy. The plant will be constructed from 2022 to 2025 and is intended to lead the way for commercial pilot plants in the late 2025s. The plant will be 70% of full scale and is expected to attain a stable plasma of 150 million degrees. In the United States, cost-sharing public-private partnership FPPs appear likely, and in 2022 the DOE announced a new Milestone-Based Fusion Development Program as the centerpiece of its Bold Decadal Vision for Commercial Fusion Energy, which envisages private sector-led teams delivering FPP pre-conceptual designs, defining technology roadmaps, and pursuing the R&amp;D necessary to resolve critical-path scientific and technical issues towards an FPP design. Compact reactor technology based on such demonstration plants may enable commercialization via a fleet approach from the 2030s if early markets can be located.

The widespread adoption of non-nuclear renewable energy has transformed the energy landscape. Such renewables are projected to supply 74% of global energy by 2050. The steady fall of renewable energy prices challenges the economic competitiveness of fusion power.

Some economists suggest fusion power is unlikely to match other renewable energy costs. Fusion plants are expected to face large start up and capital costs. Moreover, operation and maintenance are likely to be costly. While the costs of the China Fusion Engineering Test Reactor are not well known, an EU DEMO fusion concept was projected to feature a levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of $121/MWh.

Fuel costs are low, but economists suggest that the energy cost for a one-gigawatt plant would increase by $16.5 per MWh for every $1 billion increase in the capital investment in construction. There is also the risk that easily obtained lithium will be used up making batteries. Obtaining it from seawater would be very costly and might require more energy than the energy that would be generated.

In contrast, renewable levelized cost of energy estimates are substantially lower. For instance, the 2019 levelized cost of energy of solar energy was estimated to be $40-$46/MWh, on shore wind was estimated at $29-$56/MWh, and offshore wind was approximately $92/MWh.

However, fusion power may still have a role filling energy gaps left by renewables, depending on how administration priorities for energy and environmental justice influence the market. In the 2020s, socioeconomic studies of fusion that began to consider these factors emerged, and in 2022 EUROFusion launched its Socio-Economic Studies and Prospective Research and Development strands to investigate how such factors might affect commercialization pathways and timetables. Similarly, in April 2023 Japan announced a national strategy to industrialise fusion. Thus, fusion power may work in tandem with other renewable energy sources rather than becoming the primary energy source. In some applications, fusion power could provide the base load, especially if including integrated thermal storage and cogeneration and considering the potential for retrofitting coal plants.

== Regulation ==
As fusion pilot plants move within reach, legal and regulatory issues must be addressed. In September 2020, the United States National Academy of Sciences consulted with private fusion companies to consider a national pilot plant. The following month, the United States Department of Energy, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and the Fusion Industry Association co-hosted a public forum to begin the process. In November 2020, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) began working with various nations to create safety standards such as dose regulations and radioactive waste handling. In January and March 2021, NRC hosted two public meetings on regulatory frameworks. A public-private cost-sharing approach was endorsed in the 27 December H.R.133 Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, which authorized $325 million over five years for a partnership program to build fusion demonstration facilities, with a 100% match from private industry.

Subsequently, the UK Regulatory Horizons Council published a report calling for a fusion regulatory framework by early 2022 in order to position the UK as a global leader in commercializing fusion power. This call was met by the UK government publishing in October 2021 both its &quot;Fusion Green Paper&quot; and its &quot;Fusion Strategy&quot;, to regulate and commercialize fusion, respectively. Then, in April 2023, in a decision likely to influence other nuclear regulators, the NRC announced in a unanimous vote that fusion energy would be regulated not as fission but under the same regulatory regime as particle accelerators.

Then, in October 2023 the UK government, in enacting the Energy Act 2023, made the UK the first country to legislate for fusion separately from fission, to support planning and investment, including the UK&#x27;s planned prototype fusion power plant for 2040; STEP the UK is working with Canada and Japan in this regard. Meanwhile, in February 2024 the US House of Representatives passed the Atomic Energy Advancement Act, which includes the Fusion Energy Act, which establishes a regulatory framework for fusion energy systems.

== Geopolitics ==
Given the potential of fusion to transform the world&#x27;s energy industry and mitigate climate change, fusion science has traditionally been seen as an integral part of peace-building science diplomacy. However, technological developments and private sector involvement has raised concerns over intellectual property, regulatory administration, global leadership; equity, and potential weaponization. These challenge ITER&#x27;s peace-building role and led to calls for a global commission. Fusion power significantly contributing to climate change by 2050 seems unlikely without substantial breakthroughs and a space race mentality emerging, but a contribution by 2100 appears possible, with the extent depending on the type and particularly cost of technology pathways.

Developments from late 2020 onwards have led to talk of a &quot;new space race&quot; with multiple entrants, pitting the US against China and the UK&#x27;s STEP FPP, with China now outspending the US and threatening to leapfrog US technology. On 24 September 2020, the United States House of Representatives approved a research and commercialization program. The Fusion Energy Research section incorporated a milestone-based, cost-sharing, public-private partnership program modeled on NASA&#x27;s COTS program, which launched the commercial space industry. In February 2021, the National Academies published &quot;Bringing Fusion to the U.S. Grid&quot;, recommending a market-driven, cost-sharing plant for 2035–2040, and the launch of the Congressional Bipartisan Fusion Caucus followed.

In December 2020, an independent expert panel reviewed EUROfusion&#x27;s design and R&amp;D work on DEMO, and EUROfusion confirmed it was proceeding with its Roadmap to Fusion Energy, beginning the conceptual design of DEMO in partnership with the European fusion community, suggesting an EU-backed machine had entered the race.

In October 2023, the UK-oriented Agile Nations group announced a fusion working group. One month later, the UK and the US announced a bilateral partnership to accelerate fusion energy. Then, in December 2023 at COP28 the US announced a US global strategy to commercialize fusion energy. Then, in April 2024, Japan and the US announced a similar partnership, and in May of the same year, the G7 announced a G7 Working Group on Fusion Energy to promote international collaborations to accelerate the development of commercial energy and promote R&amp;D between countries, as well as rationalize fusion regulation. Later the same year, the US partnered with the IAEA to launch the Fusion Energy Solutions Taskforce, to collaboratively crowdsource ideas to accelerate commercial fusion energy, in line with the US COP28 statement.

Specifically to resolve the tritium supply problem, in February 2024, the UK (UKAEA) and Canada (Canadian Nuclear Laboratories) announced an agreement by which Canada could refurbish its Candu deuterium-uranium tritium-generating heavywater nuclear plants and even build new ones, guaranteeing a supply of tritium into the 2070s, while the UKAEA would test breeder materials and simulate how tritium could be captured, purified, and injected back into the fusion reaction.

In 2024, both South Korea and Japan announced major initiatives to accelerate their national fusion strategies, by building electricity-generating public-private fusion plants in the 2030s, aiming to begin operations in the 2040s and 2030s respectively.

== Advantages ==
Fusion power promises to provide more energy for a given weight of fuel than any fuel-consuming energy source currently in use. The fuel (primarily deuterium) exists abundantly in the ocean: about 1 in 6500 hydrogen atoms in seawater is deuterium. Although this is only about 0.015%, seawater is plentiful and easy to access, implying that fusion could supply the world&#x27;s energy needs for millions of years.

First generation fusion plants are expected to use the deuterium-tritium fuel cycle. This will require the use of lithium for breeding of the tritium. It is not known for how long global lithium supplies will suffice to supply this need as well as those of the battery and metallurgical industries. It is expected that second generation plants will move on to the more formidable deuterium-deuterium reaction. The deuterium-helium-3 reaction is also of interest, but the light helium isotope is practically non-existent on Earth. It is thought to exist in useful quantities in the lunar regolith, and is abundant in the atmospheres of the gas giant planets.

Fusion power could be used for so-called &quot;deep space&quot; propulsion within the solar system and for interstellar space exploration where solar energy is not available, including via antimatter-fusion hybrid drives.

===Helium production===

Deuterium–tritium fusion produces helium as a by-product.

== Disadvantages ==
Fusion power has a number of disadvantages. Because 80 percent of the energy in any reactor fueled by deuterium and tritium appears in the form of neutron streams, such reactors share many of the drawbacks of fission reactors. This includes the production of large quantities of radioactive waste and serious radiation damage to reactor components. Additionally, naturally occurring tritium is extremely rare. While the hope is that fusion reactors can breed their own tritium, tritium self-sufficiency is extremely challenging, not least because tritium is difficult to contain (tritium has leaked from 48 of 65 nuclear sites in the US). In any case the reserve and start-up tritium inventory requirements are likely to be unacceptably large.

If reactors can be made to operate using only deuterium fuel, then the tritium replenishment issue is eliminated and neutron radiation damage may be reduced. However, the probabilities of deuterium-deuterium reactions are about 20 times lower than for deuterium-tritium. Additionally, the temperature needed is about 3 times higher than for deuterium-tritium (see cross section). The higher temperatures and lower reaction rates thus significantly complicate the engineering challenges.

== History ==

=== Early experiments ===

The first machine to achieve controlled thermonuclear fusion was a pinch machine at Los Alamos National Laboratory called Scylla I at the start of 1958. The team that achieved it was led by a British scientist named James Tuck and included a young Marshall Rosenbluth. Tuck had been involved in the Manhattan project, but had switched to working on fusion in the early 1950s. He applied for funding for the project as part of a White House sponsored contest to develop a fusion reactor along with Lyman Spitzer. The previous year, 1957, the British had claimed that they had achieved thermonuclear fusion reactions on the Zeta pinch machine. However, it turned out that the neutrons they had detected were from beam-target interactions, not fusion, and they withdrew the claim. A CERN-sponsored study group on controlled thermonuclear fusion met from 1958 to 1964. This group ceased when it became clear that CERN discontinued its limited support for plasma physics.

Scylla I was a classified machine at the time, so the achievement was hidden from the public. A traditional Z-pinch passes a current down the center of a plasma, which makes a magnetic force around the outside which squeezes the plasma to fusion conditions. Scylla I was a θ-pinch, which used deuterium to pass a current around the outside of its cylinder to create a magnetic force in the center. After the success of Scylla I, Los Alamos went on to build multiple pinch machines over the next few years.

Spitzer continued his stellarator research at Princeton. While fusion did not immediately transpire, the effort led to the creation of the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory.

=== First tokamak ===
In the early 1950s, Soviet physicists I.E. Tamm and A.D. Sakharov developed the concept of the tokamak, combining a low-power pinch device with a low-power stellarator.
A.D. Sakharov&#x27;s group constructed the first tokamaks, achieving the first quasistationary fusion reaction.:90

Over time, the &quot;advanced tokamak&quot; concept emerged, which included non-circular plasma, internal diverters and limiters, superconducting magnets, operation in the &quot;H-mode&quot; island of increased stability, and the compact tokamak, with the magnets on the inside of the vacuum chamber.

=== First inertial confinement experiments ===
Laser fusion was suggested in 1962 by scientists at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), shortly after the invention of the laser in 1960. Inertial confinement fusion experiments using lasers began as early as 1965. Several laser systems were built at LLNL, including the Argus, the Cyclops, the Janus, the long path, the Shiva laser, and the Nova.

Laser advances included frequency-tripling crystals that transformed infrared laser beams into ultraviolet beams and &quot;chirping&quot;, which changed a single wavelength into a full spectrum that could be amplified and then reconstituted into one frequency. Laser research cost over one billion dollars in the 1980s.

=== 1980s ===
The Tore Supra, JET, T-15, and JT-60 tokamaks were built in the 1980s. In 1984, Martin Peng of ORNL proposed the spherical tokamak with a much smaller radius. It used a single large conductor in the center, with magnets as half-rings off this conductor. The aspect ratio fell to as low as 1.2.:B247:225 Peng&#x27;s advocacy caught the interest of Derek Robinson, who built the Small Tight Aspect Ratio Tokamak, (START).

=== 1990s ===
In 1991, the Preliminary Tritium Experiment at the Joint European Torus achieved the world&#x27;s first controlled release of fusion power.

In 1996, Tore Supra created a plasma for two minutes with a current of almost 1 million amperes, totaling 280 MJ of injected and extracted energy.

In 1997, JET produced a peak of 16.1 MW of fusion power (65% of heat to plasma), with fusion power of over 10 MW sustained for over 0.5 sec.

=== 2000s ===
&quot;Fast ignition&quot; saved power and moved ICF into the race for energy production.

In 2006, China&#x27;s Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST) test reactor was completed. It was the first tokamak to use superconducting magnets to generate both toroidal and poloidal fields.

In March 2009, the laser-driven ICF NIF became operational.

In the 2000s, privately backed fusion companies entered the race, including TAE Technologies, General Fusion, and Tokamak Energy.

=== 2010s ===


Private and public research accelerated in the 2010s. General Fusion developed plasma injector technology and Tri Alpha Energy tested its C-2U device. The French Laser Mégajoule began operation. NIF achieved net energy gain in 2013, as defined in the very limited sense as the hot spot at the core of the collapsed target, rather than the whole target.

In 2014, Phoenix Nuclear Labs sold a high-yield neutron generator that could sustain 5×1011 deuterium fusion reactions per second over a 24-hour period.

In 2015, MIT announced a tokamak it named the ARC fusion reactor, using rare-earth barium-copper oxide (REBCO) superconducting tapes to produce high-magnetic field coils that it claimed could produce comparable magnetic field strength in a smaller configuration than other designs.

In October, researchers at the Max Planck Institute of Plasma Physics in Greifswald, Germany, completed building the largest stellarator to date, the Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X). The W7-X stellarator began Operational phase 1 (OP1.1) on 10 December 2015, successfully producing helium plasma. The objective was to test vital systems and understand the machine&#x27;s physics. By February 2016, hydrogen plasma was achieved, with temperatures reaching up to 100 million Kelvin. The initial tests used five graphite limiters. After over 2,000 pulses and achieving significant milestones, OP1.1 concluded on 10 March 2016. An upgrade followed, and OP1.2 in 2017 aimed to test an uncooled divertor. By June 2018, record temperatures were reached. W7-X concluded its first campaigns with limiter and island divertor tests, achieving notable advancements by the end of 2018. It soon produced helium and hydrogen plasmas lasting up to 30 minutes.

In 2017, Helion Energy&#x27;s fifth-generation plasma machine went into operation. The UK&#x27;s Tokamak Energy&#x27;s ST40 generated &quot;first plasma&quot;. The next year, Eni announced a $50 million investment in Commonwealth Fusion Systems, to attempt to commercialize MIT&#x27;s ARC technology.

=== 2020s ===
In January 2021, SuperOx announced the commercialization of a new superconducting wire with more than 700 A/mm2 current capability.

TAE Technologies announced results for its Norman device, holding a temperature of about 60 MK for 30 milliseconds, 8 and 10 times higher, respectively, than the company&#x27;s previous devices.

In October, Oxford-based First Light Fusion revealed its projectile fusion project, which fires an aluminum disc at a fusion target, accelerated by a 9 mega-amp electrical pulse, reaching speeds of . The resulting fusion generates neutrons whose energy is captured as heat.

On November 8, in an invited talk to the 63rd Annual Meeting of the APS Division of Plasma Physics, the National Ignition Facility claimed to have triggered fusion ignition in the laboratory on August 8, 2021, for the first time in the 60+ year history of the ICF program. The shot yielded 1.3 MJ of fusion energy, an over 8X improvement on tests done in spring of 2021. NIF estimates that 230 kJ of energy reached the fuel capsule, which resulted in an almost 6-fold energy output from the capsule. A researcher from Imperial College London stated that the majority of the field agreed that ignition had been demonstrated.

In November 2021, Helion Energy reported receiving $500 million in Series E funding for its seventh-generation Polaris device, designed to demonstrate net electricity production, with an additional $1.7 billion of commitments tied to specific milestones, while Commonwealth Fusion Systems raised an additional $1.8 billion in Series B funding to construct and operate its SPARC tokamak, the single largest investment in any private fusion company.

In April 2022, First Light announced that their hypersonic projectile fusion prototype had produced neutrons compatible with fusion. Their technique electromagnetically fires projectiles at Mach 19 at a caged fuel pellet. The deuterium fuel is compressed at Mach 204, reaching pressure levels of 100 TPa.

On December 13, 2022, the US Department of Energy reported that researchers at the National Ignition Facility had achieved a net energy gain from a fusion reaction. The reaction of hydrogen fuel at the facility produced about 3.15 MJ of energy while consuming 2.05 MJ of input. However, while the fusion reactions may have produced more than 3 megajoules of energy—more than was delivered to the target—NIF&#x27;s 192 lasers consumed 322 MJ of grid energy in the conversion process.

In May 2023, the United States Department of Energy (DOE) provided a grant of $46 million to eight companies across seven states to support fusion power plant design and research efforts. This funding, under the Milestone-Based Fusion Development Program, aligns with objectives to demonstrate pilot-scale fusion within a decade and to develop fusion as a carbon-neutral energy source by 2050. The granted companies are tasked with addressing the scientific and technical challenges to create viable fusion pilot plant designs in the next 5–10 years. The recipient firms include Commonwealth Fusion Systems, Focused Energy Inc., Princeton Stellarators Inc., Realta Fusion Inc., Tokamak Energy Inc., Type One Energy Group, Xcimer Energy Inc., and Zap Energy Inc. 

In December 2023, the largest and most advanced tokamak JT-60SA was inaugurated in Naka, Japan. The reactor is a joint project between Japan and the European Union. The reactor had achieved its first plasma in October 2023. Subsequently, South Korea&#x27;s fusion reactor project, the Korean Superconducting Tokamak Advanced Research, successfully operated for 102 seconds in a high-containment mode (H-mode) containing high ion temperatures of more than 100 million degrees in plasma tests conducted from December 2023 to February 2024.

In January 2025, EAST fusion reactor in China was reported to maintain a steady-state high-confinement plasma operation for 1066 seconds. In February 2025, the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) announced that its WEST tokamak had maintained a stable plasma for 1,337 seconds—over 22 minutes. 

==Future development==
Claims of commercially viable fusion power being relatively imminent have often attracted ridicule within the scientific community. A common joke is that human-engineered fusion has always been promised as 30 years away since the concept was first discussed, or that it has been &quot;20 years away for 50 years&quot;.

In 2024, Commonwealth Fusion Systems announced plans to build the world&#x27;s first grid-scale commercial nuclear fusion power plant at the James River Industrial Center in Chesterfield County, Virginia, which is part of the Greater Richmond Region; the plant is designed to produce about 400 MW of electric power, and is intended to come online in the early 2030s.

<text>The Jin dynasty or Jin Empire, sometimes distinguished as the or the , was an imperial dynasty in China that existed from 266 to 420. It was founded by Sima Yan, eldest son of Sima Zhao, who had previously been declared the King of Jin. There are two main divisions in the history of the dynasty. The (266–316) was established as the successor to Cao Wei after Sima Yan usurped the throne from Cao Huan. The capital of the Western Jin was initially in Luoyang, though it later moved to Chang&#x27;an (modern Xi&#x27;an). In 280, after conquering Eastern Wu, the Western Jin ended the Three Kingdoms period and reunited China proper for the first time since the end of the Han dynasty.

From 291 to 306, a series of civil wars known as the War of the Eight Princes were fought over control of the Jin state which weakened it considerably. In 304, the dynasty experienced a wave of rebellions by non-Han ethnicities termed by exonym as &quot;Five Barbarians&quot;. The &quot;barbarians&quot; went on to establish nonpermanent dynastic states in northern China. This helped to usher in the Sixteen Kingdoms era of Chinese history, in which states in the north rose and fell in rapid succession, constantly fighting both one another and the Jin. Han-Zhao, one of the northern states established during the disorder, sacked Luoyang in 311, captured Chang&#x27;an in 316, and executed Emperor Min of Jin in 318, ending the Western Jin era. Sima Rui, who succeeded Emperor Min, then reestablished the Jin dynasty with its capital in Jiankang (modern Nanjing), inaugurating the (317–420).

The Eastern Jin dynasty remained in near-constant conflict with its northern neighbors for most of its existence, and it launched several invasions of the north with the aim of recovering its lost territories. In 383, the Eastern Jin inflicted a devastating defeat on the Former Qin, a Di-ruled state that had briefly unified northern China. In the aftermath of that battle, the Former Qin state splintered, and Jin armies recaptured the lands south of the Yellow River. The Eastern Jin was eventually usurped by General Liu Yu in 420 replaced with the Liu Song dynasty. The Eastern Jin dynasty is considered the second of the Six Dynasties.

== History ==


=== Background ===

During the Three Kingdoms period, the Sima clan—with its most accomplished individual being Sima Yi—rose to prominence within the kingdom of Cao Wei that dominated northern China. Sima Yi was the regent of Cao Wei, and in 249 he instigated a coup d&#x27;état known as the Incident at the Gaoping Tombs, the Sima clan began to surpass the Cao clan&#x27;s power in the kingdom. After Sima Yi&#x27;s death in 251, Sima Yi&#x27;s eldest son Sima Shi succeeded his father as regent of Cao Wei, maintaining the Sima clan&#x27;s tight grip on the Cao Wei political scene. After Sima Shi&#x27;s death in 255, Sima Shi&#x27;s younger brother Sima Zhao became the regent of Cao Wei. Sima Zhao further assisted his clans&#x27; interests by suppressing rebellions and dissent.

In 263, he directed Cao Wei forces in conquering Shu Han and capturing Liu Shan (the son of Liu Bei), marking the first demise of one of the Three Kingdoms. Sima Zhao&#x27;s actions awarded him the title of King of Jin, the last achievable rank beneath that of emperor. He was granted the title because his ancestral home was located in Wen County, on the territory of the Zhou-era state of Jin, which was centered on the Jin River in Shaanxi. Sima Zhao&#x27;s ambitions for the throne were visible, but he died in 265 before any usurpation attempt could be made, passing the opportunity to his ambitious son Sima Yan.

=== Western Jin (266–316) ===

==== Founding ====
The Jin dynasty was founded by Sima Yan, who was known posthumously as Emperor Wu (the &quot;Martial Emperor of Jin&quot;). After succeeding his father as the King of Jin and regent of Cao Wei in 265, Sima Yan declared himself emperor of the Jin dynasty in February 266 and forced the final Wei ruler Cao Huan to abdicate. Emperor Wu permitted Cao Huan to live with honour as the Prince of Chenliu, and buried him with imperial ceremony. Under Emperor Wu, the Jin dynasty conquered Eastern Wu in 280 and united China proper, thus ending the Three Kingdoms period. The period of unity was relatively short-lived, as the Jin state was soon weakened by corruption, political turmoil, and internal conflicts. Emperor Wu&#x27;s son Zhong, posthumously known as Emperor Hui, was developmentally disabled.

==== Decline ====

Emperor Wu died in 290, and in 291 conflict over his succession caused the devastating War of the Eight Princes. The dynasty was greatly weakened by this civil conflict, and it soon faced more upheaval when the Upheaval of the Five Barbarians began in 304. During this unrest, the Jin capital Luoyang was sacked by Han-Zhao ruler Liu Cong in 311, and Jin emperor Sima Chi, posthumously known as Emperor Huai, was captured and later executed. Emperor Huai&#x27;s successor Sima Ye, posthumously known as Emperor Min, was then also captured and executed by Han-Zhao forces when they seized Chang&#x27;an (present-day Xi&#x27;an) in 316. This event marked the end of the Western Jin. The surviving members of the Jin imperial family, as well as large numbers of Han Chinese from the North China Plain, subsequently fled to southern China. These refugees had a large impact on the lands they moved to—for example, they gave Quanzhou&#x27;s Jin River its name upon their settlement there.

=== Eastern Jin (317–420) ===

==== Establishment ====

After the fall of Chang&#x27;an and the execution of Emperor Min of Jin, Sima Rui, posthumously known as Emperor Yuan, was enthroned as Jin emperor in 318. He reestablished the Jin government at Jiankang (present-day Nanjing), which became the dynasty&#x27;s new capital. This marked the start of the Eastern Jin period. One of Sima Rui&#x27;s titles was the prince of Langya, so the recently established northern states, who denied the legitimacy of his succession, occasionally referred to his empire as &quot;Langya&quot;.

The Eastern Jin period witnessed the pinnacle of &quot;menfa&quot; ( &#x27;gentry clan&#x27;) politics. The authority of the emperors was limited, while national affairs were controlled by powerful immigrant elite clans like the Wang () clans of Langya and Taiyuan, the Xie () clan of Chenliu, the Huan () clan of Qiao Commandery, and the Yu () clan of Yingchuan. Among the people, a common remark was that &quot;Wang Dao and Sima Rui, they dominate the nation together&quot; (). It was said that when Emperor Yuan was holding court, he even invited Wang Dao to sit by his side so they could jointly accept congratulations from ministers, but Wang Dao declined the offer.

==== Wars with the north ====

In order to recover the lands lost during the fall of the Western Jin, the Eastern Jin dynasty launched several military campaigns against the northern states, such as the expeditions led by Huan Wen from 354 to 369. Most notably, in 383, a heavily outnumbered Eastern Jin force inflicted a devastating defeat on the state of Former Qin at the Battle of Fei River. After this battle, the Former Qin—which had recently unified northern China—began to collapse, and the Jin dynasty recovered the lands south of the Yellow River. Some of these lands were later lost, but the Jin regained them once more when Liu Yu defeated the northern states in his northern expeditions of 409–416.

Despite successes against the northern states like the Battle of Fei River, paranoia in the royal family and a constant disruptions to the throne often caused loss of support for northern campaigns. For example, lack of support by the Jin court was a major cause of Huan Wen&#x27;s failure to recover the north in his expeditions. Additionally, internal military crises—including the rebellions of generals Wang Dun and Su Jun, but also lesser &quot;fangzhen&quot; ( &#x27;military command&#x27;) revolts—plagued the Eastern Jin throughout its 104-year existence.

==== Mass migration to the south ====
The local aristocrat clans of the south were often at odds with the immigrants from the north. As such, tensions increased, and rivalry between the immigrants and southern locals loomed large in the domestic politics of the Jin. Two of the most prominent local clans, the Zhou () clan of Yixing and the Shen () clan of Wuxing, were dealt a bitter blow from which they never quite recovered. There was also conflict between the various northern immigrant clans. This led to a virtual balance of power, which somewhat benefited the emperor&#x27;s rule.

Special &quot;commanderies of immigrants&quot; and &quot;white registers&quot; were created for the massive amounts of northern Han Chinese who moved south during the Eastern Jin. The southern Chinese aristocracy was formed from the offspring of these migrants. Particularly in the Jiangnan region, Celestial Masters and the nobility of northern China subdued the nobility of southern China during the Jin dynasty. Southern China overtook the north in population due to depopulation of the north and the migration of northern Chinese to southern China. Different waves of migration of aristocratic Chinese from northern China to the south at different times resulted in distinct groups of aristocratic lineages.

=== Demise ===
In 403, Huan Xuan, the son of esteemed general Huan Wen, usurped the Jin throne and declared the dynasty of Huan Chu. Huan Xuan was soon toppled by Liu Yu, who reinstated Jin rule by installing Sima Dezong on the throne, posthumously known as Emperor An. Meanwhile, the civilian administration suffered, as there were further revolts led by Sun En and Lu Xun, and Western Shu became an independent kingdom under Qiao Zong. In 419, Liu Yu had Sima Dezong strangled and replaced by his brother Sima Dewen, posthumously known as Emperor Gong. Finally, in 420, Sima Dewen abdicated in favour of Liu Yu, who declared himself the ruler of the new Song dynasty (which is referred to as the Liu Song dynasty by historians in order to prevent confusion with the Song dynasty established in 960). Sima Dewen was then asphyxiated with a blanket in the following year. In the north, Northern Liang, the last of the Sixteen Kingdoms, was conquered by Northern Wei in 439, ushering in the Northern dynasties period.

The Xianbei Northern Wei accepted the Jin refugees () and (). They both married Xianbei princesses. Sima Fei&#x27;s wife was named Huayang (), who was a daughter of Emperor Xiaowen; Sima Chuzhi&#x27;s son was Sima Jinlong, who married a Northern Liang princess who was a daughter of the Lushuihu king Juqu Mujian. More than fifty percent of Tuoba Xianbei princesses of the Northern Wei were married to southern Han Chinese men from the imperial families and aristocrats from southern China of the Southern dynasties who defected and moved north to join the Northern Wei. Much later, Sima Guang (1019–1086), who served as chancellor for the Song and created the comprehensive history &quot;Zizhi Tongjian&quot;, claimed descent from the Jin dynasty (specifically, Sima Fu, brother of Sima Yi).

== Government and demography ==
=== &quot;Qiaoren&quot; and &quot;baiji&quot; ===
The uprising of the five barbarians led to one in eight northerners migrating to the south. These immigrants were called &quot;qiaoren&quot; ( &#x27;lodged people&#x27;), accounting for one-sixth of the population of the south at the time. With consideration of the material loss refugees had experienced before arrival, they were exempt from the &quot;diao&quot; () tax, and other services. Those whose registers were bound in white paper were called &quot;baiji&quot; (), while the others with registers bound in yellow paper were called &quot;huangji&quot; (). When the crisis had subsided, this preferential increasingly seemed a heavy burden on the people, arousing dissatisfaction in the natives. Hence, &quot;tu duan&quot; was an increasingly important issue for the Eastern Jin.

=== Lodged administrative divisions ===
The Eastern Jin court established three levels of administrative divisions which served as strongholds for the &quot;qiaoren&quot;: the &quot;qiaozhou&quot; (, &#x27;province&#x27;), &quot;qiaojun&quot; (, &#x27;commandery&#x27;), and qiaoxian (, the lodged county), these lodged administrative divisions were merely nominal without possessing actual domain, or rather, they were local government in exile; what could scarcely be denied was their significance in Jin&#x27;s legitimacy for the northern territory as somewhat an announcement. Furthermore, it was also an action done to appease the refugees&#x27; homesickness, which was evoking their desire to reacquire what had been lost.
During the rule of Emperor Yuan, Emperor Ming, and Emperor Cheng, the lodged administrative divisions were concentrated in the area south of the Huai River and the Lower Yangtze Plain. At first there was the lodged Langya Commandery within lodged Fei County in Jiankang, but when it began is not exactly known. Then the lodged Huaide County was also established in Jiankang, around 320. According to the &quot;Book of Song&quot;:晉永嘉大亂，幽、冀、青、並、兗州及徐州之淮北流民，相率過淮，亦有過江在晉陵郡界者……又徙流民之在淮南者于晉陵諸縣，其徙過江南及留在江北者，並立僑郡縣以司牧之。徐、兗二州或治江北，江北又僑立幽、冀、青、並四州……(After Disaster of Yongjia, the refugees from You, Ji, Qing, Bing, Yan and Xu provinces came across the Huai River, some even came across the Yangtze River and stayed in Jinling Commandery... The lodged administrative divisions were established to govern them. The seats of Xu and Yan provinces perhaps were moved to the area north of the Yangtze River, where the lodged You, Ji, Qing, Bing provinces were established.)

The lodged Pei, Qinghe, Xiapi, Dongguang, Pingchang, Jiyin, Puyang, Guangping, Taishan, Jiyang, and Lu commanderies were established when Emperor Ming ruled. The rebellions and invasions occurring in Jianghuai area led to more refugees switching to settle in the south of the Yangtze River, where the lodged Huainan Commandery was established afterwards.

However, carrying these out was more complex than the policy was formulated. Several actual counties were under the jurisdiction of the lodged commanderies.

A few lodged administrative divisions are still retained in China nowadays. For instance, Dangtu County was originally located in the area of Bengbu, however, the lodged Dangtu County was established in where it is now, and the latter replaced the former, inheriting its place name.

=== Tu Duan policy ===

The &quot;tu duan&quot; () is the abbreviation for &quot;yi tu duan&quot; (, means classifying people according to their present habitation to register). It was a policy to ensure the ancient hukou system working since the Western Jin. These terms were first recorded in the biographies of Wei Guan and Li Chong included in the &quot;Book of Jin&quot;:今九域同規，大化方始，臣等以為宜皆蕩除末法，一擬古制，以土斷，定自公卿以下，皆以所居為正，無復懸客遠屬異土者。然承魏氏凋弊之跡，人物播越，仕無常朝，人無定處，郎吏蓄於軍府，豪右聚於都邑，事體駁錯，與古不同。謂九品既除，宜先開移徙，聽相並就。且明貢舉之法，不濫於境外，則冠帶之倫將不分而自均，即土斷之實行矣。Hence, it was perhaps initially proposed by these two people, but was only seriously implemented during the Eastern Jin and the Southern dynasties.

== Society and culture ==
=== Religion ===

Taoism was polarised in the Jin dynasty. The Jin emperors repressed Taoists harshly, but also tried to exploit it, given the way it had been used near the end of the Han era in the Yellow Turban Rebellion. Amidst the political turmoil of the era, many successful merchants, small landowners, and other moderately comfortable people found great solace in Taoist teachings and a number of major clans and military officers also took up the faith. Ge Hong emphasized loyalty to the emperor as a Taoist virtue; he even taught that rebels could never be Taoist immortals, which made Taoism more palatable to the imperial hierarchy. As a result, popular Taoist religions were considered heterodoxy while the official schools of the court were supported, but the popular schools like Tianshi Taoism were still secretly held dear and promulgated amongst ordinary people.

Disunity, disintegration, and chaos also made Buddhism more popular, in part due to the focus on addressing suffering. The Jin dynasty marked a critical era for the Mahayana school in China. Dharmarakṣa&#x27;s 286 translation of the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot; was the most important one before Kumārajīva&#x27;s 5th-century translation. It was said that there were 1,768 Buddhist temples in the Eastern Jin.

Furthermore, Taoism advanced chemistry and medicine in China, whereas the contribution of Mahayana was concentrated in philosophy and literature.

=== Material culture ===
The Jin dynasty is well known for the quality of its greenish celadon porcelain wares, which immediately followed the development of proto-celadon. Jar designs often incorporated animal, as well as Buddhist, figures. Examples of Yue ware are also known from the Jin dynasty.

<text>Josquin Lebloitte dit des Prez ( – 27 August 1521) was a composer of High Renaissance music, who is variously described as French or Franco-Flemish. Considered one of the greatest composers of the Renaissance, he was a central figure of the Franco-Flemish School and had a profound influence on the music of 16th-century Europe. Building on the work of his predecessors Guillaume Du Fay and Johannes Ockeghem, he developed a complex style of expressive—and often imitative—movement between independent voices (polyphony) which informs much of his work. He further emphasized the relationship between text and music, and departed from the early Renaissance tendency towards lengthy melismatic lines on a single syllable, preferring to use shorter, repeated motifs between voices. Josquin was a singer, and his compositions are mainly vocal. They include masses, motets and secular chansons.

Josquin&#x27;s biography has been continually revised by modern scholarship, and remains highly uncertain. Little is known of his early years; he was born in the French-speaking area of Flanders, and he may have been an altar boy and have been educated at the Cambrai Cathedral, or taught by Ockeghem. By 1477 he was in the choir of René of Anjou and then probably served under Louis XI of France. Now a wealthy man, in the 1480s Josquin traveled Italy with the Cardinal Ascanio Sforza, may have worked in Vienna for the Hungarian king Matthias Corvinus, and wrote the motet &quot;Ave Maria ... Virgo serena&quot;, and the popular chansons &quot;Adieu mes amours&quot; and &quot;Que vous ma dame&quot;. He served Pope Innocent VIII and Pope Alexander VI in Rome, Louis XII in France, and Ercole I d&#x27;Este in Ferrara. Many of his works were printed and published by Ottaviano Petrucci in the early 16th century, including the &quot;Missa Hercules Dux Ferrariae&quot;. In his final years in Condé, Josquin produced some of his most admired works, including the masses &quot;Missa de Beata Virgine&quot; and &quot;Missa Pange lingua&quot;; the motets &quot;Benedicta es&quot;, &quot;Inviolata&quot;, &quot;Pater noster–Ave Maria&quot; and &quot;Praeter rerum seriem&quot;; and the chansons &quot;Mille regretz&quot;, &quot;Nimphes, nappés&quot; and &quot;Plus nulz regretz&quot;.

Influential both during and after his lifetime, Josquin has been described as the first Western composer to retain posthumous fame. His music was widely performed and imitated in 16th-century Europe, and was highly praised by Martin Luther and the music theorists Heinrich Glarean and Gioseffo Zarlino. In the Baroque era, Josquin&#x27;s reputation became overshadowed by the Italian composer Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, though he was still studied by some theorists and music historians. During the 20th-century early music revival, publications by August Wilhelm Ambros, Albert Smijers, Helmuth Osthoff and Edward Lowinsky, and a successful academic conference, caused his reevaluation as a central figure in Renaissance music. This has led to controversy over whether he has been unrealistically elevated over his contemporaries, particularly in light of over a hundred attributions now considered dubious. He continues to draw interest in the 21st century and his music is frequently recorded, central in the repertoire of early music vocal ensembles, and the subject of continuing scholarship. He was celebrated worldwide on the 500th anniversary of his death in 2021.
==Name==
Josquin&#x27;s full name, Josquin Lebloitte dit des Prez, became known in the late 20th century from a pair of 1483 documents found in Condé-sur-l&#x27;Escaut, where he is referred to as the nephew of Gille Lebloitte dit des Prez and the son of Gossard Lebloitte dit des Prez. His first name Josquin is a diminutive form of Josse, the French form of the name of a Judoc, a Breton saint of the 7th century. Josquin was a common name in Flanders and Northern France in the 15th and 16th centuries. Other documents indicate that the surname des Prez had been used by the family for at least two generations, perhaps to distinguish them from other branches of the Lebloitte family. At the time, the name Lebloitte was rare and the reason that Josquin&#x27;s family took up the more common surname des Prez as their dit name remains uncertain.

His name has many spellings in contemporary records: his first name is spelled as Gosse, Gossequin, Jodocus, Joskin, Josquinus, Josse, Jossequin, Judocus and Juschino; and his surname is given as a Prato, de Prato, Pratensis, de Prés, Desprez, des Prés and des Près. In his motet &quot;Illibata Dei virgo nutrix&quot;, he includes an acrostic of his name, where it is spelled IOSQVIN Des PREZ. Documents from Condé, where he lived for the last years of his life, refer to him as &quot;Maistre Josse Desprez&quot;. These include a letter written by the chapter of Notre-Dame of Condé to Margaret of Austria where he is named as &quot;Josquin Desprez&quot;. Scholarly opinion differs on whether his surname should be written as one word (Desprez) or two (des Prez), with publications from continental Europe preferring the former and English-language publications the latter. Modern scholarship typically refers to him as Josquin.

==Life==
===Early life===
====Birth and background====
Little is known about Josquin&#x27;s early years. The specifics of his biography have been debated for centuries. The musicologist William Elders noted that &quot;it could be called a twist of fate that neither the year, nor the place of birth of the greatest composer of the Renaissance is known&quot;. A now-outdated theory is that he was born around 1440, based on a mistaken association with Jushinus de Kessalia, recorded in documents as &quot;Judocus de Picardia&quot;. A reevaluation of his later career, name and family background has discredited this claim. He is now thought to have been born around 1450, and at the latest 1455, making him a &quot;a close contemporary&quot; of composers Loyset Compère and Heinrich Isaac, and slightly older than Jacob Obrecht.

Josquin&#x27;s father Gossart dit des Prez was a policeman in the castellany of Ath, who was accused of numerous offenses, including complaints of undue force, and disappears from the records after 1448. Nothing is known of Josquin&#x27;s mother, who is absent from surviving documents, suggesting that she was either not considered Josquin&#x27;s legitimate mother, or that she died soon after, or during, his birth. Around 1466, perhaps on the death of his father, Josquin was named by his uncle and aunt, Gille Lebloitte dit des Prez and Jacque Banestonne, as their heir.

Josquin was born in the French-speaking area of Flanders, in modern-day northeastern France or Belgium. Despite his association with Condé in his later years, Josquin&#x27;s own testimony indicates that he was not born there. The only firm evidence for his birthplace is a later legal document in which Josquin described being born beyond Noir Eauwe, meaning &#x27;Black Water&#x27;. This description has puzzled scholars, and there are various theories on which body of water is being referred to. L&#x27;Eau Noire river in the Ardennes has been proposed, and there was a village named Prez there, though the musicologist David Fallows contends that the complications surrounding Josquin&#x27;s name make a surname connection irrelevant, and that the river is too small and too far from Condé to be a candidate. Fallows proposes a birthplace near the converging Escaut and Haine rivers at Condé, preferring the latter since it was known for transporting coal, perhaps fitting the &quot;Black Water&quot; description. Other theories include a birth near Saint-Quentin, Aisne, due to his early association with the Collegiate Church of Saint-Quentin, or in the small village of Beaurevoir, which is near the Escaut, a river that may be referred to in an acrostic in his later motet &quot;Illibata Dei virgo nutrix&quot;.

====Youth====
There is no documentary evidence covering Josquin&#x27;s education or upbringing. Fallows associates him with Goseequin de Condent, an altar boy at the collegiate church of Saint-Géry, Cambrai until mid-1466. Other scholars such as Gustave Reese relay a 17th-century account from Cardinal Richelieu&#x27;s friend Claude Hémeré, suggesting that Josquin became a choirboy with his friend Jean Mouton at the Collegiate Church of Saint-Quentin; this account has been questioned. The collegiate chapel there was an important center of royal patronage and music for the area. All records from Saint-Quentin were destroyed in 1669, and Josquin may have acquired his later connections with the French royal chapel through an early association with Saint-Quentin. He may have studied under Johannes Ockeghem, a leading composer whom he greatly admired throughout his life. This is claimed by later writers such as Gioseffo Zarlino and Lodovico Zacconi; Josquin wrote a lamentation on the death of Ockeghem, &quot;Nymphes des bois&quot;. There is no concrete evidence for this tutorship, and later commentators may only have meant that Josquin &quot;learnt from the older composer&#x27;s example&quot;. Josquin musically quoted Ockeghem several times, most directly in his double motet &quot;Alma Redemptoris mater/Ave regina caelorum&quot;, which shares an opening line with Ockeghem&#x27;s motet &quot;Alma Redemptoris mater&quot;.

Josquin could have been associated with Cambrai Cathedral, as there is a &quot;des Prez&quot; among the cathedral&#x27;s musicians listed in &quot;Omnium bonorum plena&quot;, a motet by Compère. The motet was composed before 1474 and names many important musicians of the time, including Antoine Busnois, Johannes Tinctoris, Johannes Regis, Ockeghem and Guillaume Du Fay. The motet may refer to the singer Pasquier Desprez, but Josquin is a likelier candidate. Josquin was certainly influenced by Du Fay&#x27;s music; the musicologist Alejandro Planchart suggests that the impact was not particularly large.

====Early career====
The first firm record of Josquin&#x27;s employment is from 19 April 1477 when he was a singer in the chapel of René of Anjou, in Aix-en-Provence. Other evidence may place him in Aix as early as 1475. Josquin remained there until at least 1478, after which his name disappears from historical records for five years. He may have remained in René&#x27;s service, joining his other singers to serve Louis XI, who sent them to the Sainte-Chapelle of Paris. Josquin&#x27;s connection to Louis XI could be furthered by his early motet &quot;Misericordias Domini in aeternum cantabo&quot;, which may be a musical tribute for the king, since it ends with the psalm verse &quot;In te Domine speravi, non confundar in aeternum&quot;, the line Louis commissioned Jean Bourdichon to write on 50 scrolls in the Château de Plessis-lez-Tours. A less accepted theory for Josquin&#x27;s activities between 1478 and 1483 is that he had already entered the household of his future employer Ascanio Sforza in 1480. In that case, Josquin would have been with Ascanio in Ferrara and might have written his &quot;Missa Hercules Dux Ferrariae&quot; at this time for Ercole d&#x27;Este. Around this period the &quot;Casanatense chansonnier&quot; was collected in Ferrara, which includes six chansons by Josquin, &quot;Adieu mes amours&quot;, &quot;En l&#x27;ombre d&#x27;ung buissonet&quot;, &quot;Et trop penser&quot;, &quot;Ile fantazies de Joskin&quot;, &quot;Que vous ma dame&quot; and &quot;Une mousque de Biscaye&quot;. &quot;Adieu mes amours&quot; and &quot;Que vous ma dame&quot; are thought to have been particularly popular, given their wide dissemination in later sources.

In February 1483 Josquin returned to Condé to claim his inheritance from his aunt and uncle, who may have been killed when the army of Louis XI besieged the town in May 1478 and had the population locked and burned in a church. In the same document, the collegiate church of Condé is reported to have given &quot;vin d&#x27;honneur&quot; () to Josquin, because &quot;as a musician who had already served two kings, he was now a distinguished visitor to the little town&quot;. Josquin hired at least 15 procurators to deal with his inheritance, suggesting he was then wealthy. This would explain how later in his life he was able to travel frequently and did not have to compose greatly demanded mass cycles like contemporaries Isaac and Ludwig Senfl.

===Italy and travels===
==== Milan and elsewhere====
A surviving record indicates that Josquin was in Milan by 15 May 1484, perhaps just after his 1483 trip to Condé. In March 1484 he may have visited Rome. Fallows speculates that Josquin left Condé for Italy so quickly because his inheritance gave him more freedom and allowed him to avoid serving a king who he suspected had caused the deaths of his aunt and uncle. By then, the sacred music of Milan Cathedral had a reputation for excellence. Josquin was employed by the House of Sforza, and on 20 June 1484 came into the service of Cardinal Ascanio Sforza. Josquin&#x27;s renown as a composer, a strong recommendation from a patron of fellow musician, or the use of his wealth, might have helped him get this prestigious and long-term position. While working for Ascanio, on 19 August Josquin successfully requested a previously rejected dispensation to be rector at the parish church Saint Aubin without having been ordained a priest. Joshua Rifkin dates the well-known motet &quot;Ave Maria ... Virgo serena&quot; to this time, .

Josquin went to Rome with Ascanio in July 1484 for a year, and may have gone to Paris for a litigation suit involving the benefice in Saint Aubin during the later 1480s. Around this time the poet Serafino dell&#x27;Aquila wrote his sonnet to Josquin, &quot;Ad Jusquino suo compagno musico d&#x27;Ascanio&quot; (&quot;To Josquin, his fellow musician of Ascanio&quot;), which asks him &quot;not to be discouraged if his &#x27;genius so sublime&#x27; seemed poorly remunerated&quot;. Between 1485 and 1489 Josquin may have served under the Hungarian king Matthias Corvinus in Vienna; an account by the Cardinal Girolamo Aleandro in 1539 recalls the archbishop of Esztergom stating that the court of Matthias included &quot;excellent painters and musicians, among them even Josquin himself&quot;. Some scholars suggest Aleandro was repeating a false rumor, or that Varday confused Josquin des Prez for Josquin Dor or Johannes de Stokem. Fallows contends that it is unlikely that Varday, who was well-educated and a musician, would have made such a mistake, but concedes that it is possible. The court of Matthias had a high standard of music and employed numerous musicians, many of them from Italy. Though Fallows asserts that Josquin&#x27;s presence in the Hungarian king&#x27;s service is likely, the evidence is circumstantial, and no original documents survive to confirm the claim. Josquin was in Milan again in January 1489, probably until early May, and met the theorist and composer Franchinus Gaffurius there.

====Rome====
From June 1489 until at least April 1494, Josquin was a member of the papal choir in Rome, under Pope Innocent VIII then the Borgia pope Alexander VI. Josquin may have arrived there due to an exchange of singers between Ludovico Sforza and Pope Innocent, where the latter sent Gaspar van Weerbeke to Milan, presumably in return for Josquin. Josquin&#x27;s arrival brought much-needed prestige to the choir, as the composers Gaspar and Stokem had left recently and the only other choristers known to be composers were Marbrianus de Orto and Bertrandus Vaqueras. Two months after his arrival, Josquin laid claim to the first of various benefices on 18 August. Holding three unrelated benefices at once, without having residency there or needing to speak that area&#x27;s language, was a special privilege that Josquin&#x27;s tenure and position offered; many of his choir colleagues had also enjoyed such privileges. His claims included a canonry at the Notre-Dame de Paris; Saint Omer, Cambrai; a parish in the gift of Saint-Ghislain Abbey; the Basse-Yttre parish church; two parishes near Frasnes, Hainaut; and Saint-Géry, Cambrai. Surviving papal letters indicate that some of these claims were approved, but he does not appear to have taken up any of the canonries. The Sistine Chapel&#x27;s monthly payment records give the best record of Josquin&#x27;s career, but all papal chapel records from April 1494 to November 1500 are lost, making it unknown when he left Rome.

After restorations from 1997 to 1998, the name was found as a graffito on the wall of the Sistine Chapel&#x27;s &quot;cantoria&quot; (choir gallery). It is one of almost four hundred names inscribed in the chapel, around a hundred of which can be identified with singers of the papal choir. They date from the 15th to 18th centuries, and the signature is in the style of the former. There is some evidence suggesting the name refers to Josquin des Prez; it may be interpreted as either &quot;Josquin&quot; or &quot;Josquinus&quot;, depending on whether the curved line on the far right is read as the abbreviation for &quot;us&quot;. Other choristers named Josquin tended to sign their name in full, whereas Josquin des Prez is known to have done so mononymously on occasion. Andrea Adami da Bolsena notes in his 1711 &quot;Osservazioni per ben regolare il coro dei cantori della Cappella Pontificia&quot; that in his time Josquin&#x27;s name was visibly &#x27;sculpted&#x27; in the Sistine Chapel&#x27;s choir room. The musicologist Richard Sherr writes that &quot;while this is not a true autograph signature, the possibility that Josquin des Prez actually produced it during his stay in the papal chapel is very high&quot;, and Fallows says that &quot;it hardly counts as an autograph, but it may be the closest we can get.&quot;

===France===
Documents found since the late 20th century have shed some light on Josquin&#x27;s life and works between 1494 and 1503; at some point he was ordained a priest. In August 1494 he went to Cambrai, as attested by a &quot;vin d&#x27;honneur&quot; () record, and he may have returned to Rome soon after. From then to 1498 there is no firm evidence for his activities; Fallows suggests he stayed in Cambrai for these four years, citing Johannes Manlius&#x27;s 1562 book &quot;Locorum communium collectanea&quot;, which associates Josquin with Cambrai&#x27;s musical establishment. This assertion would fit with Josquin&#x27;s possible youthful connections in Cambrai and later &quot;vin d&#x27;honneur&quot; there. Manlius cites the reformer Philip Melanchthon as the source for many of his stories, strengthening the authenticity of his Josquin anecdotes; Melanchthon was close to musical figures of his time, including the publisher Georg Rhau and the composer Adrianus Petit Coclico.

Two letters between members of the House of Gonzaga and Ascanio Sforza suggest that Josquin may have re-entered the service of the Sforza family in Milan around 1498; they refer to a servant Juschino who delivered the hunting dogs to the Gonzagas. Circumstantial evidence suggests Juschino may have been Josquin des Prez, but he is not known to have been qualified for such a task, and it would be unusual to refer to him as a servant rather than a musician or singer. Josquin probably did not stay in Milan long, since his former employers were captured during Louis XII&#x27;s 1499 invasion. Before he left, he most likely wrote two secular compositions, the well-known frottola &quot;El Grillo&quot; (&quot;The Cricket&quot;), and &quot;In te Domine speravi&quot; (&quot;I have placed my hope in you, Lord&quot;), based on Psalm 31. The latter might be a veiled reference to the religious reformer Girolamo Savonarola, who had been burned at the stake in Florence in 1498, and for whom Josquin seems to have had a special reverence; the text was Savonarola&#x27;s favorite psalm, a meditation on which he left unfinished in prison when he was executed.

Josquin was probably in France during the early 16th century; documents found in 2008 indicate that he visited Troyes twice between 1499 and 1501. The long doubted account from Hémeré that Josquin had a canonry at Saint-Quentin was confirmed by documentary evidence that he had exchanged it by 30 May 1503. Canonries at Saint-Quentin were almost always gifts from the French king to royal household members, suggesting Josquin had been employed by Louis XII. According to Glarean in the &quot;Dodecachordon&quot; of 1547, the motet &quot;Memor esto verbi tui servo tuo&quot; (&quot;Remember thy promise unto thy servant&quot;) was composed as a gentle reminder to the king to keep his promise of a benefice to Josquin. Glarean claimed that on receiving the benefice, Josquin wrote a motet on the text &quot;Bonitatem fecisti cum servo tuo, Domine&quot; (&quot;Lord, thou hast dealt graciously with thy servant&quot;) to show his gratitude to the king, either Louis XI or Louis XII. Although such a motet survives and is mentioned with Josquin&#x27;s &quot;Memor esto&quot; in many sources, &quot;Bonitatem fecisti&quot; is now attributed to Carpentras. Some of Josquin&#x27;s other compositions have been tentatively dated to his French period, such as &quot;Vive le roy&quot;, and &quot;In exitu Israel&quot;, which resembles the style of other composers of the French court. The five-voice &quot;De profundis&quot;, a setting of Psalm 130, seems to have been written for a royal funeral, perhaps that of Louis XII, Anne of Brittany or Philip I of Castile.

===Ferrara===
Josquin arrived in Ferrara by 30 May 1503, to serve Ercole I d&#x27;Este, Duke of Ferrara, an arts patron who had been trying for many years to replace the composer and choirmaster Johannes Martini, who had recently died. No extant documents record Josquin as having worked in Ferrara before, though his earlier associations with Ercole suggest prior employment there; he signed a deed indicating he did not intend to stay there for long. Ercole is known to have met with Josquin&#x27;s former employer Louis XII throughout 1499 to 1502, and these meetings may have led to his service for the Duke. Two letters survive explaining the circumstances of his arrival, both from courtiers who scouted musical talent in the service of Ercole. The first of these was from Girolamo da Sestola (nicknamed &quot;Coglia&quot;) to Ercole, explaining: &quot;My lord, I believe that there is neither lord nor king who will now have a better chapel than yours if your lordship sends for Josquin [...] and by having Josquin in our chapel I want to place a crown upon this chapel of ours&quot; (14 August 1502). The second letter, from the courtier Gian de Artiganova, criticized Josquin and suggested Heinrich Isaac instead:

Around three months later, Josquin was chosen; his salary of 200 ducats was the highest ever for a ducal chapel member. The Artiganova letter is a unique source for Josquin&#x27;s personality, and the musicologist Patrick Macey interprets it as meaning he was a &quot;difficult colleague and that he took an independent attitude towards producing music for his patrons&quot;. Edward Lowinsky connected his purportedly difficult behavior with musical talent, and used the letter as evidence that Josquin&#x27;s contemporaries recognized his genius. Musicologist Rob Wegman questions whether meaningful conclusions can be drawn from such an anecdote. In a later publication, Wegman notes the largely unprecedented nature of such a position and warns &quot;yet of course the letter could equally well be seen to reflect the attitudes and expectations of its recipient, Ercole d&#x27;Este&quot;.

While in Ferrara, Josquin wrote some of his most famous compositions, including the austere, Savonarola-influenced &quot;Miserere mei, Deus&quot;, which became one of the most widely distributed motets of the 16th century. Also probably from this period was the virtuoso motet &quot;Virgo salutiferi&quot;, set to a poem by Ercole Strozzi, and &quot;O virgo prudentissima&quot; based on a poem by Poliziano. Due to its stylistic resemblance to &quot;Miserere&quot; and &quot;Virgo salutiferi&quot;, the &quot;Missa Hercules Dux Ferrariae&quot; is also attributed to this time; it was previously thought to have been written in the early 1480s. Josquin did not stay in Ferrara long. An outbreak of the plague in 1503 prompted the evacuation of the Duke and his family, as well as two-thirds of the citizens, and Josquin left by April 1504. His replacement, Obrecht, died of the plague in mid-1505.

===Condé===
Josquin probably moved from Ferrara to his home region of Condé-sur-l&#x27;Escaut, and became provost of the collegiate church of Notre-Dame on 3 May 1504; he may have obtained the post from Philip I&#x27;s sponsorship. His role gave him political responsibility, and put him in charge of a workforce which included a dean, a treasurer, 25 canons, 18 chaplains, 16 vicars, 6 choir-boys and other priests. This was an appealing place for his old age: it was near his birthplace, had a renowned choir and was the leading musical establishment in Hainaut, besides St. Vincent at Soignies and Cambrai Cathedral. Very few records of his activity survive from this time; he bought a house in September 1504, and sold it (or a different one) in November 1508. The Josquin mentioned may be the Joskin who traveled to present chansons to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor in Brussels or Mechelen.

In his later years Josquin composed many of his most admired works. They include the masses &quot;Missa de Beata Virgine&quot; and &quot;Missa Pange lingua&quot;; the motets &quot;Benedicta es&quot;, &quot;Inviolata&quot;, &quot;Pater noster–Ave Maria&quot; and &quot;Praeter rerum seriem&quot;; and the chansons &quot;Mille regretz&quot;, &quot;Nimphes, nappés&quot; and &quot;Plus nulz regretz&quot;. The last of these, &quot;Plus nulz regretz&quot;, is set to a poem by Jean Lemaire de Belges that celebrates the future engagement between Charles V and Mary Tudor. In his last years Josquin&#x27;s music saw European-wide dissemination through publications by the printer Ottaviano Petrucci. Josquin&#x27;s compositions were given a prominent place by Petrucci, and were reissued numerous times.

On his deathbed, Josquin left an endowment for the performance of his work, &quot;Pater noster&quot;, at all general processions when townsfolk passed his house, stopping to place a wafer on the marketplace altar to the Holy Virgin. He died on 27 August 1521 and left his possessions to Condé&#x27;s chapter of Notre Dame. He was buried in front of the church&#x27;s high altar, but his tomb was destroyed, either during the French Wars of Religion (1562–1598) or in 1793 when the church was demolished amid the French Revolution.

== Music ==

After Du Fay died in 1474, Josquin and his contemporaries lived in a musical world of frequent stylistic change, in part due to the movement of musicians between different regions of Europe. A line of musicologists credits Josquin with three primary developments:

1) The gradual departure from extensive melismatic lines, and emphasis instead on smaller motifs. These &quot;motivic cells&quot; were short, easily recognizable melodic fragments which passed from one voice to another in a contrapuntal texture, giving it an inner unity.

2) The prominent use of imitative polyphony, equally between voices, which &quot;combines a rational and homogeneous integration of the musical space with a self-renewing rhythmic impetus&quot;.

3) A focus on the text, with the music serving to emphasize its meaning, an early form of word painting.

The musicologist Jeremy Noble concludes that these innovations demonstrate the transition from the earlier music of Du Fay and Ockeghem, to Josquin&#x27;s successors Adrian Willaert and Jacques Arcadelt, and eventually to the late Renaissance composers Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina and Orlande de Lassus.
Josquin was a professional singer throughout his life, and his compositions are almost exclusively vocal. He wrote in primarily three genres: the mass, motet, and chanson (with French text). In his 50-year career, Josquin&#x27;s body of work is larger than that of any other composer of his period, besides perhaps Isaac and Obrecht. Establishing a chronology of his compositions is difficult; the sources in which they were published offer little evidence, and historical and contextual connections are meager. Few manuscripts of Josquin&#x27;s music date from before the 16th century, due to, according to Noble, &quot;time, war and enthusiasm (both religious and anti-religious)&quot;. Identifying earlier works is particularly difficult, and later works only occasionally offer any more certainty. The musicologist Richard Taruskin writes that modern scholarship is &quot;still nowhere near a wholly reliable chronology and unlikely ever to reach it&quot;, and suggests that the current tentative models &quot;tell us more about ourselves, and the way in which we come to know what we know, than they do about Josquin&quot;.

=== Masses ===
The mass is the central rite of the Catholic Church, and polyphonic settings of the ordinary of the mass—the Kyrie, Gloria, Credo, Sanctus and Agnus Dei—increased in popularity in the 14th century. From the 15th century, composers treated it as a central genre in Western classical music in accordance with greater demand. By Josquin&#x27;s time, masses were generally standardized into substantial, polyphonic five-movement works, making it difficult for composers to satisfy both liturgical and musical demands. Previous examples in the genre by composers such as Du Fay and Ockeghem were widely admired and emulated.

Josquin and Obrecht led an intensive development of the genre. Josquin&#x27;s masses are generally less progressive than his motets—though he is credited with numerous innovations in the genre. His less radical approach may be explained by most of the masses being earlier works, or the structural and textual limitations of the genre. Almost all are for four voices.

The &quot;Josquin Companion&quot; categorizes the composer&#x27;s masses into the following styles:
* Canonic masses, which contains one or more voices derived from another via strict imitation;
* &quot;Cantus firmus&quot; masses, in which a pre-existing tune appears in one voice of the texture, with the other voices being more or less freely composed;
* Paraphrase masses, based on a popular monophonic song which is used freely in all voices, and in many variations;
* Parody masses, based on a polyphonic song, which appears in whole or in part, with material from all voices in use, not just the tune; and
* Solmization masses, named soggetto cavato by Zarlino, in which the base tune is drawn from the syllables of a name or phrase.

Josquin began his career at a time when composers started to find strict &quot;cantus firmus&quot; masses limiting. He pioneered paraphrase and parody masses, which were not well established before the 16th century. Many of his works combine the &quot;cantus firmus&quot; style with paraphrase and parody, making strict categorization problematic. Reflecting on Josquin&#x27;s masses, Noble notes that &quot;In general his instinct, at least in his mature works, seems to be to extract as much variety as possible from his given musical material, sacred or secular, by any appropriate means.&quot;

==== Canonic masses ====
Josquin&#x27;s predecessors and contemporaries wrote masses based on canonic imitation. The canonic voices in these masses derive from pre-existing melodies such as the &quot;L&#x27;homme armé&quot; song (Faugues, Compère and Forestier), or chant (Fevin and La Rue&#x27;s &quot;Missae de feria&quot;). Josquin&#x27;s two canonic masses are not based on existing tunes, and so stand apart from the mainstream. They are closer to the &quot;Missa prolationum&quot; written by Ockeghem, and &quot;Missa ad fugam&quot; by de Orto, both of which use original melodies in all the voices.

Josquin&#x27;s two canonic masses were published in Petrucci&#x27;s third book of Josquin masses in 1514; the &quot;Missa ad fugam&quot; is the earlier of the two. It has a head-motif consisting of the whole first Kyrie which is repeated in the beginning of all five movements. The canon is restricted to the highest voice, and the pitch interval between the voices is fixed while the temporal interval varies between only two values; the two free voices generally do not participate in the imitation. The precise relationship of Josquin&#x27;s mass to de Orto&#x27;s is uncertain, as is Josquin&#x27;s authorship of the mass.

No questions of authenticity cloud the &quot;Missa sine nomine&quot;, written during Josquin&#x27;s final years in Condé. In contrast to the inflexibility of the canonic scheme in the &quot;Missa ad fugam&quot;, the temporal and pitch interval of the canon, along with the voices that participate in it, are varied throughout. The free voices are more fully integrated into the texture, and frequently participate in imitation with the canonic voices, sometimes preemptively.

====&quot;Cantus firmus&quot; masses====
Prior to Josquin&#x27;s mature period, the most common technique for writing masses was the &quot;cantus firmus&quot;, a technique which had been in use for most of the 15th century. Josquin used the technique early in his career, with the &quot;Missa L&#x27;ami Baudichon&quot; considered to be one of his earliest masses. This mass is based on a secular tune similar to &quot;Three Blind Mice&quot;. Basing a mass on such a source was an accepted procedure, as evidenced by the existence of the mass in Sistine Chapel part-books copied during the papacy of Julius II (1503–1513).

Josquin&#x27;s most famous &quot;cantus firmus&quot; masses are the two based on the &quot;L&#x27;homme armé&quot; (), a popular tune for mass composition throughout the Renaissance. Though both are relatively mature compositions, they are very different. &quot;Missa L&#x27;homme armé super voces musicales&quot;, is a technical tour-de-force on the tune, containing numerous mensuration canons and contrapuntal display. Throughout the work, the melody is presented on each note of the natural hexachord: C, D, E, F, G and A. The later &quot;Missa L&#x27;homme armé sexti toni&quot; is a &quot;fantasia on the theme of the armed man.&quot; While based on a &quot;cantus firmus&quot;, it is also a paraphrase mass, for fragments of the tune appear in all voices; throughout the work the melody appears in a wide variety of tempos and rhythms. Technically it is almost restrained, compared to the other &quot;L&#x27;homme armé&quot; mass, until the closing Agnus Dei, which contains a complex canonic structure including a rare retrograde canon, around which other voices are woven.

====Paraphrase masses====
The paraphrase mass differed from the &quot;cantus firmus&quot; technique in that the source material, though still monophonic, could be (by Josquin&#x27;s time) highly embellished, often with ornaments. As in the &quot;cantus firmus&quot; technique, the source tune may appear in many voices of the mass. Several of Josquin&#x27;s masses feature the paraphrase technique, such as the early &quot;Missa Gaudeamus&quot;, which also includes &quot;cantus firmus&quot; and canonic elements. The &quot;Missa Ave maris stella&quot;, also probably an early work, paraphrases the Marian antiphon of the same name; it is one of his shortest masses. The late &quot;Missa de Beata Virgine&quot; paraphrases plainchants in praise of the Virgin Mary. As a Lady Mass, it is a votive mass for Saturday performance, and was his most popular mass in the 16th century.

The best known of Josquin&#x27;s paraphrase masses, and one of the most famous mass settings of the Renaissance, is the &quot;Missa Pange lingua&quot;, based on a hymn by Thomas Aquinas for the Vespers of Corpus Christi. It was probably the last mass Josquin composed. This mass is an extended fantasia on the tune, using the melody in all voices and all parts of the mass, in elaborate and ever-changing polyphony. One of the high points of the mass is the &quot;et incarnatus est&quot; section of the Credo, where the texture becomes homophonic, and the tune appears in the topmost voice. Here the portion which would normally set—&quot;Sing, O my tongue, of the mystery of the divine body&quot;—is instead given the words &quot;And he became incarnate by the Holy Ghost from the Virgin Mary, and was made man.&quot; Noble comments that &quot;The vigour of the earlier masses can still be felt in the rhythms and the strong drive to cadences, perhaps more so than in the &quot;Missa de Beata Virgine&quot;, but essentially the two contrasting strains of Josquin&#x27;s music—fantasy and intellectual control—are so blended and balanced in these two works that one can see in them the beginnings of a new style: one which reconciles the conflicting aims of the great 15th-century composers in a new synthesis that was in essence to remain valid for the whole of the 16th century.&quot;

====Parody masses====
Du Fay was one of the first to write masses based on secular songs (a parody mass), and his &quot;Missa Se la face ay pale&quot;, dates to the decade of Josquin&#x27;s birth. By the turn of the 16th century, composers were moving from quoting single voice lines, to widen their reference to all voices in the piece. This was part of the transition from the medieval &quot;cantus firmus&quot; mass, where the voice bearing the preexisting melody stood aloof from the others, to the Renaissance parody masses, where all the voices formed an integrated texture. In such masses, the source material was not a single line, but motifs and points of imitation from all voices within a polyphonic work. By the time Josquin died, these parody masses had become well established and Josquin&#x27;s works demonstrate the variety of methods in musical borrowing during this transition period.

Six works are generally attributed to Josquin which borrow from polyphonic pieces, two of which also include canonic features. One of these—the &quot;Missa Di dadi&quot;, which includes a canon in the &quot;Benedictus&quot;—is based on a chanson by Robert Morton and has the rhythmic augmentation of the borrowed tenor part indicated by dice faces, which are printed next to the staff. Canon can also be found in the &quot;Osanna&quot; of the &quot;Missa Faisant regretz&quot; which is based on Walter Frye&#x27;s &quot;Tout a par moy&quot;. The &quot;Missa Fortuna desperata&quot; is based on the popular three-voice Italian song &quot;Fortuna desperata&quot;. In this mass, Josquin used each of the Italian song&#x27;s voices as &quot;cantus firmi&quot;, varying throughout the work. A similar variation in the source material&#x27;s voices is used in the &quot;Missa Malheur me bat&quot;, based on a chanson variously attributed to Martini or Abertijne Malcourt. The dating of &quot;Missa Malheur me bat&quot; remains controversial, with some scholars calling it an early composition, and others a later one. The &quot;Missa Mater Patris&quot;, based on a three-voice motet by Antoine Brumel, is probably the earliest true parody mass by any composer, as it no longer contains any hint of a &quot;cantus firmus&quot;. &quot;Missa D&#x27;ung aultre amer&quot; is based on a popular chanson of the same name by Ockeghem, and is one of Josquin&#x27;s shortest masses.

====Solmization mass====
A solmization mass is a polyphonic mass which uses notes drawn from a word or phrase. The style is first described by Zarlino in 1558, who called it &quot;soggetto cavato&quot;, from &quot;soggetto cavato dalle parole&quot;, meaning &quot;carved out of the words&quot;. The earliest known mass by any composer using solmization syllables is the &quot;Missa Hercules Dux Ferrariae&quot;, which Josquin wrote for Ercole I. It is based on a &quot;cantus firmus&quot; of musical syllables of the Duke&#x27;s name, &#x27;Ercole, Duke of Ferrara&#x27;, which in Latin is &#x27;Hercules Dux Ferrarie&#x27;. Taking the solmization syllables with the same vowels gives: , which is in modern nomenclature. The &quot;Missa Hercules Dux Ferrariae&quot; remains the best known work to use this device and was published by Petrucci in 1505, relatively soon after its composition. Taruskin notes that the use of Ercole&#x27;s name is Josquin&#x27;s method of memorialization for his patron, akin to a portrait painting.

The other Josquin mass to prominently use this technique is the &quot;Missa La sol fa re mi&quot;, based on the musical syllables contained in &quot; (&quot;let me take care of it&quot;). Essentially the entire mass&#x27;s content is related to this phrase, and the piece is thus something of an ostinato. The traditional story, as told by Glarean in 1547, was that an unknown aristocrat used to order suitors away with this phrase, and Josquin immediately wrote an &quot;exceedingly elegant&quot; mass on it as a jab at him. Scholars have proposed different origins for the piece; Lowinsky has connected it to the court of Ascanio Sforza, and the art historian Dawson Kiang connected it to the Turkish prince Cem Sultan&#x27;s promise to the pope to overthrow his brother Bayezid II.

=== Motets ===
Josquin&#x27;s motets are his most celebrated and influential works. Their style varies considerably, but can generally be divided into homophonic settings with block chords and syllabic text declamation; ornate—and often imitative—contrapuntal fantasias in which the text is overshadowed by music; and psalm settings which combined these extremes with the addition of rhetorical figures and text-painting that foreshadowed the later development of the madrigal. He wrote most of them for four voices, which had become the compositional norm by the mid-15th century, and descended from the four-part writing of Guillaume de Machaut and John Dunstaple in the late Middle Ages. Josquin was also a considerable innovator in writing motets for five and six voices.

Many of the motets use compositional constraint on the process; others are freely composed. Some use a &quot;cantus firmus&quot; as a unifying device, some are canonic, others use a motto which repeats throughout, and some use several of these methods. In some motets which use canon, it is designed to be heard and appreciated as such; in others a canon is present, but difficult to hear. Josquin frequently used imitation in writing his motets, with sections akin to fugal expositions occurring on successive lines of the text he was setting. This is prominent in his motet &quot;Ave Maria ... Virgo serena&quot;, an early work where each voice enters by restating the line sung before it. Other early works such as a &quot;Alma Redemptoris mater/Ave regina caelorum&quot; show prominent imitation, as do later ones such as his setting of &quot;Dominus regnavit&quot; (Psalm 93) for four voices. Josquin favored the technique throughout his career.

Few composers before Josquin had written polyphonic psalm settings, and these form a large proportion of his later motets. Josquin&#x27;s settings include the famous &quot;Miserere&quot; (Psalm 51); &quot;Memor esto verbi tui&quot;, based on Psalm 119; and two settings of &quot;De profundis&quot; (Psalm 130), which are often considered to be among his most significant accomplishments. Josquin wrote several examples of a new type of piece developed in Milan, the motet-chanson. Though similar to 15th-century works based on the &quot;formes fixes&quot; mold which were completely secular, Josquin&#x27;s motet-chansons contained a chant-derived Latin &quot;cantus firmus&quot; in the lowest of the three voices. The other voices sang a secular French text, which had either a symbolic relationship to the sacred Latin text, or commented on it. Josquin&#x27;s three known motet-chansons are &quot;Que vous madame/In pace&quot;, &quot;A la mort/Monstra te esse matrem&quot; and &quot;Fortune destrange plummaige/Pauper sum ego&quot;.

===Secular music===
Josquin left numerous French chansons, for three to six voices, some of which were probably intended for instrumental performance as well. In his chansons, he often used a &quot;cantus firmus&quot;, sometimes a popular song whose origin can no longer be traced, as in &quot;Si j&#x27;avoye Marion&quot;. In other works he used a tune originally associated with a separate text, or freely composed an entire song, using no apparent external source material. Another technique Josquin used was to take a popular song and write it as a canon with itself, in two inner voices, and write new melodic material above and around it, to a new text: he did this in one of his most famous chansons, &quot;Faulte d&#x27;argent&quot;.

Josquin&#x27;s earliest chansons were probably composed in northern Europe, under the influence of composers such as Ockeghem and Busnois. Unlike them, he never adhered strictly to the conventions of the &quot;formes fixes&quot;—the rigid and complex repetition patterns of the rondeau, virelai, and ballade—instead he often wrote his early chansons in strict imitation, as with many of his sacred works. He was one of the first to write chansons with all voices equal parts of the texture, and many contain points of imitation, similar to his motets. He also used melodic repetition, especially where the lines of text rhymed, and many of his chansons had a lighter texture and faster tempo than his motets. Some of his chansons were almost certainly designed to be performed with instruments; Petrucci published many of them without text, and some of the pieces (for example, the fanfare-like &quot;Vive le roy&quot;) contain writing more idiomatic for instruments than voices. Josquin&#x27;s most famous chansons circulated widely in Europe; some of the better-known include his lament on the death of Ockeghem, &quot;Nymphes des bois/Requiem aeternam&quot;; &quot;Mille regretz&quot;, an uncertain attribution to Josquin; &quot;Nimphes, nappés&quot;; and &quot;Plus nulz regretz&quot;.

Josquin also wrote at least three pieces in the manner of the frottola, a popular Italian song form which he would have heard during his years in Milan. These songs include &quot;Scaramella&quot;, &quot;El grillo&quot; and &quot;In te domine speravi&quot;. They are even simpler in texture than his French chansons, being almost uniformly syllabic and homophonic, and they remain among his most frequently performed pieces.

==Portraits==
A small woodcut portraying Josquin is the most reproduced image of any Renaissance composer. Printed in Petrus Opmeer&#x27;s 1611 &quot;Opus chronographicum orbis universi&quot;, the woodcut is the earliest known depiction of Josquin and presumably based on an oil painting which Opmeer says was kept in the collegiate church of St. Goedele. Church documents discovered in the 1990s have corroborated Opmeer&#x27;s statement about the painting&#x27;s existence. It may have been painted during Josquin&#x27;s lifetime and was owned by Petrus Jacobi (), a cantor and organist at St. Gudula, Brussels. Following the will&#x27;s instructions, the altarpiece was placed next to Jacobi&#x27;s tomb, but it was destroyed in the late 16th century by Protestant iconoclasts. Whether the woodcut is a realistic likeness of the oil painting remains uncertain; Elders notes that comparisons between contemporaneous woodcuts based on original paintings that do survive often show incompetent realizations, putting the accuracy of the woodcut in question.

The &quot;Portrait of a Musician&quot;, widely attributed to Leonardo da Vinci, depicts a man holding sheet music, which has led many scholars to identify him as a musician. The work is usually dated to the mid-1480s, and numerous candidates have been proposed, including Franchinus Gaffurius and Atalante Migliorotti, though none have achieved wide approval. In 1972, the Belgian musicologist argued the subject is Josquin; she interpreted the words on the sitter&#x27;s sheet music as &quot;Cont&quot; (an abbreviation of &quot;Contratenor&quot;), &quot;Cantuz&quot; (Cantus) and &quot;A Z&quot; (an abbreviation of &quot;Altuz&quot;), and she identified the music as Josquin&#x27;s &quot;llibata Dei Virgo nutrix&quot;. Several factors make this unlikely: the painting does not resemble the Opmeer portrait, the notation is largely illegible and as a priest in his mid-thirties Josquin does not seem like the younger layperson in the portrait. Fallows disagrees, noting that &quot;a lot of new details point to Josquin, who was the right age, in the right place, had already served at least two kings, and was now rich enough to have his portrait painted by the best&quot;, but concludes that &quot;we shall probably never know who Leonardo&#x27;s musician was&quot;.

A portrait from the early 16th century kept in the Galleria nazionale di Parma is often related to Josquin. It is usually attributed to Filippo Mazzola, and is thought to depict the Italian music theorist , though neither the attribution nor sitter are certain. The man in the painting is holding an altered version of Josquin&#x27;s canon &quot;Guillaume se va chauffer&quot;. Fallows notes that the subject has similar facial features to the portrait printed by Opmeer, but concludes that there is not enough evidence to conclude Josquin is the sitter. Clercx-Lejeune also suggested Josquin was depicted in Jean Perréal&#x27;s fresco of the liberal arts in Le Puy Cathedral, but this has not achieved acceptance from other scholars. An 1811 painting by depicts Josquin; it was created long after the composer&#x27;s death, but Clercx-Lejeune has contended that it is an older portrait which Housez restored and modified.

== Legacy==
===Influence===
Elders described Josquin as &quot;the first composer in the history of Western music not to have been forgotten after his death&quot;, while John Milsom called him &quot;the towering composer of the Renaissance&quot;. Fallows wrote that his influence on 16th century European music is comparable to that of Beethoven on the 19th and Igor Stravinsky on the 20th century. Comparisons with Beethoven are particularly common, though Taruskin cautions that:

His popularity led to imitation by fellow composers, and some publishers (especially in Germany) misattributed works to him after his death to meet the demand for new Josquin compositions. This inspired a well-known remark that &quot;now that Josquin is dead, he is producing more compositions than when he was still alive&quot;. Fallows asserts that the issue was more complex than publishers attempting to increase their profits: similar names of composers and compositions caused confusion, as did works which quoted Josquin, or student works which imitated his style. Josquin&#x27;s pupils may have included Jean Lhéritier and Nicolas Gombert; Coclico claimed to be his student, though his statements are notoriously unreliable.

Numerous composers wrote laments after his death, three of which were published by Tielman Susato in a 1545 edition of Josquin&#x27;s music. These included works by Benedictus Appenzeller, Gombert, Jacquet of Mantua and Jheronimus Vinders, as well as the anonymous &quot;Absolve, quaesumus&quot;, while Jean Richafort&#x27;s requiem musically quoted him. Josquin&#x27;s compositions traveled widely after his death, more so than those of Du Fay, Ockeghem and Obrecht combined. Surviving copies of his motets and masses in Spanish cathedrals date from the mid-16th century, and the Sistine Chapel is known to have performed his works regularly throughout the late 16th century and into the 17th. Instrumental arrangements of his works were often published from the 1530s to the 1590s. Josquin was described by Taruskin as the &quot;master architect&quot; of High Renaissance music, and his compositions were parodied or quoted throughout Europe by almost every major composer of the later Renaissance, including Arcadelt, Brumel, Bartolomé de Escobedo, Antoine de Févin, Robert de Févin, George de La Hèle, Lupus Hellinck, , Lassus, Jacquet, Claudio Merulo, Philippe de Monte, Pierre Moulu, Philippe Rogier, Palestrina, Cipriano de Rore, Nicola Vicentino and Willaert.

===Reputation===
====Commendation, decline and reconsideration====
There is little information on Josquin&#x27;s reputation during his lifetime. His composition of masses was commended by Paolo Cortesi, and the poet Jean Molinet and the music theorists Gaffurius and Pietro Aron wrote about his works. Josquin&#x27;s popularity during his lifetime is also suggested by publications: Petrucci&#x27;s &quot;Misse Josquin&quot; of 1502 was the first single-composer mass anthology, and Josquin was the only composer whose masses merited a second and a third volume. Fallows asserts that Josquin gained European renown between 1494 and 1503, since the Petrucci publications and references by Gaffurius and Molinet occurred during this time. After Josquin&#x27;s death, humanists such as Cosimo Bartoli, Baldassare Castiglione and François Rabelais praised him, with Bartoli describing him as Michelangelo&#x27;s equal in music. Josquin was championed by the later theorists Heinrich Glarean and Gioseffo Zarlino, and the theologian Martin Luther declared &quot;he is the master of the notes. They must do as he wills; as for the other composers, they have to do as the notes will.&quot;

Upon the emergence of Baroque music in the 17th century, Josquin&#x27;s dominance began to lessen. He was overshadowed by Palestrina, who dominated the pre-common practice period musical narrative, and whose compositions were considered the summit of polyphonic refinement. Until the 20th century, discussion of Josquin&#x27;s music was mainly limited to music scholars such as the theorists Angelo Berardi in the 1680s–1690s, and Johann Gottfried Walther in 1732. The late 18th century saw a new interest in Netherlandish music: studies from Charles Burney, Johann Nikolaus Forkel, and François-Joseph Fétis gave Josquin more prominence. The music historian August Wilhelm Ambros described Josquin in the 1860s as &quot;one of the towering figures of Western music history, not merely a forerunner of Palestrina but his equal&quot;, and his research established the foundation for modern Josquin scholarship. In the early 20th century, leading musicologists such as Alfred Einstein and Carl Dahlhaus largely dismissed Josquin. Various publications then began to raise his status, beginning with a new edition of his complete works by Albert Smijers (1920s) and high evaluation by Friedrich Blume in the &quot;&quot; series. The early music revival raised Josquin&#x27;s status, and brought the first major study on him by Helmuth Osthoff (Vol 1 1962/Vol 2 1965), an influential article by Lowinsky (1964), and debates between the musicologist Joseph Kerman and Lowinsky (1965). The 1971 International Josquin Festival-Conference firmly established Josquin in the center of Renaissance music, a position later cemented by Lowinsky&#x27;s 1976 monograph. The &quot;New Josquin Edition&quot; began publication in 1987.

====Skepticism and revision====
Reflecting on the sentiment that Josquin was &quot;the greatest composer of his generation, and the most important, innovative, and influential composer of the late 15th and early 16th centuries&quot;, Sherr notes growing dissent from that position in the early 21st century. Josquin&#x27;s 2001 article in &quot;Grove Music Online&quot; lists fewer than 200 works attributed to him, down from more than 370. These revisions of Josquin&#x27;s &quot;oeuvre&quot; have compromised some earlier scholarship which analyzed Josquin&#x27;s style with works now not considered his. Major revision has also occurred in Josquin&#x27;s biography, with entire portions of it being rewritten due to Josquin having been confused with people with similar names. Controversy has arisen about the extent of Josquin&#x27;s influence; there is no doubt about his importance in Western music, but some scholars have contended that the extent of his reevaluation has unrealistically apotheosized him over his contemporaries. Wegman asserts that Obrecht was more highly regarded in Josquin&#x27;s time, to which Noble has noted that Josquin&#x27;s prestigious positions, publications and employers &quot;scarcely looks like the career of an unregarded composer&quot;. Reflecting on the dispute, Sherr has concluded that Josquin&#x27;s reputation is somewhat lessened, but on the basis of his most admired and firmly attributed works &quot;he remains one of the towering figures in the history of music&quot;.

Since the 1950s, Josquin&#x27;s music has become central to the repertoire of many early music vocal ensembles and has been increasingly featured in recordings, with those by the Hilliard Ensemble, Orlando Consort, and A Sei Voci recommended by critics in the &quot;1001 Classical Recordings You Must Hear Before You Die&quot; (2017) survey. The Tallis Scholars have recorded all of Josquin&#x27;s masses, and won the &quot;Gramophone&quot; &quot;record of the year&quot; in 1987 for their recording of &quot;Missa Pange lingua&quot;, the only early music group to do so. Josquin&#x27;s presence in 21st-century scholarship remains strong; he was the subject of David Fallows&#x27;s major monograph (2009), which is currently the standard biography for the composer, and he and Machaut were the only pre-Baroque composers to have entire chapters in Taruskin&#x27;s &quot;Oxford History of Western Music&quot; (2005). The 500th anniversary of Josquin&#x27;s death in 2021 was widely commemorated.
