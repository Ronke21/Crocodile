<text>John Burgee (born August 28, 1933) is an American architect noted for his contributions to Postmodern architecture. He was a partner of Philip Johnson from 1967 to 1991, creating together the partnership firm Johnson/Burgee Architects. Their landmark collaborations included Pennzoil Place in Houston and the AT&amp;T World Headquarters in New York. Burgee eased Johnson out of the firm in 1991, and when it subsequently went bankrupt, Burgee&#x27;s design career was essentially over. Burgee is retired, and resides in California.

==Life and career==
Burgee graduated from the School of Architecture at the University of Notre Dame in 1956, and served on the university&#x27;s board of trustees from 1988 until 2006, when he was named trustee emeritus, and on the School of Architecture&#x27;s advisory council from 1982. He also served on the boards of the Architectural League of New York, Lenox Hill Hospital, Columbia University&#x27;s Master of Sciences Program in Real Estate Development, the Parsons School of Design, and the Friends of the Upper East Side Historic District, and was the co-chairman of the Architectural Committee of the Statue of Liberty/Ellis Island Centennial Commission. For the Institute for Architecture and Urban Studies, Burgee was president and chairman.

==Johnson/Burgee Architects==
John Burgee and Philip Johnson established Johnson/Burgee in Manhattan in 1968, with Burgee as the firm&#x27;s CEO, and they collaborated on many designs. In 1984, Raj Ahuja, who had been an associate with the firm for 15 years, was made a full partner. Two years later, they moved into the Lipstick Building at 885 Third Avenue, between 53rd and 54th Streets, which the firm had designed. That same year, Burgee negotiated a lesser role in the partnership for Johnson, as a design consultant, and in 1988 he asked Ahuja to leave. Completing the transformation of the firm, in 1991 Johnson left altogether, at Burgee&#x27;s behest. Shortly thereafter, the firm went into bankruptcy because of an arbitration connected to Ahuja&#x27;s leaving, and Burgee&#x27;s career was dealt a serious blow.

<doc id="53404" wikidata="Q180374" url="?curid=53404" title="Frank Gehry">
<text>Frank Owen Gehry ( ; ; born February 28, 1929) is a Canadian-American architect and designer. A number of his buildings, including his private residence in Santa Monica, California, have become attractions. 

Gehry rose to prominence in the 1970s with his distinctive style that blended everyday materials with complex, dynamic structures. Gehry&#x27;s approach to architecture has been described as deconstructivist, though he himself resists categorization. His works are considered among the most important of contemporary architecture in the 2010 World Architecture Survey, leading &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; to call him &quot;the most important architect of our age&quot;.

Gehry is known for his postmodern designs and use of bold, unconventional forms and materials. His most famous works include the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao in Spain, the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, and the Louis Vuitton Foundation in Paris, and the National Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial in Washington D.C. These buildings are characterized by their sculptural, often undulating exteriors and innovative use of materials such as titanium and stainless steel.

Throughout his career, Gehry has received numerous awards and honors, including the Pritzker Architecture Prize in 1989, considered the field&#x27;s highest honor. He has also been awarded the National Medal of Arts and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in the United States. Gehry&#x27;s influence extends beyond architecture; he has designed furniture, jewelry, and liquor bottles.

==Early life==
Frank Owen Gehry was born Frank Owen Goldberg on February 28, 1929, in Toronto, Ontario, to parents Sadie Thelma (née Kaplanski/Caplan) and Irving Goldberg. His American father was born in New York City to Russian-Jewish parents, and his Polish-Jewish mother was an immigrant born in Łódź, Poland. A creative child, he was encouraged by his grandmother, Leah Caplan, with whom he built little cities out of scraps of wood. With these scraps from her husband&#x27;s hardware store, she entertained him for hours, building imaginary houses and futuristic cities on the living room floor.

Gehry&#x27;s use of corrugated steel, chain-link fencing, unpainted plywood, and other utilitarian or &quot;everyday&quot; materials was partly inspired by spending Saturday mornings at his grandfather&#x27;s hardware store. He spent time drawing with his father, and his mother introduced him to the world of art. &quot;So the creative genes were there&quot;, Gehry says. &quot;But my father thought I was a dreamer, I wasn&#x27;t gonna amount to anything. It was my mother who thought I was just reticent to do things. She would push me.&quot;

He was given the Hebrew name &quot;Ephraim&quot; by his grandfather, but used it only at his bar mitzvah. In 1954, Gehry changed his surname from Goldberg to Gehry, after his then-wife Anita expressed concern about antisemitism.

===Education===
In 1947, Gehry&#x27;s family immigrated to the United States, settling in California. He got a job driving a delivery truck and studied at Los Angeles City College.

According to Gehry, &quot;I was a truck driver in L.A., going to City College, and I tried radio announcing, which I wasn&#x27;t very good at. I tried chemical engineering, which I wasn&#x27;t very good at and didn&#x27;t like, and then I remembered. You know, somehow I just started wracking my brain about, &#x27;What do I like?&#x27; Where was I? What made me excited? And I remembered art, that I loved going to museums and I loved looking at paintings, loved listening to music. Those things came from my mother, who took me to concerts and museums. I remembered Grandma and the blocks, and just on a hunch, I tried some architecture classes.&quot; 

Gehry went on to graduate from the University of Southern California&#x27;s School of Architecture in 1954. During that time, he became a member of Alpha Epsilon Pi. He then spent time away from architecture in numerous other jobs, including service in the United States Army. In the fall of 1956, he moved his family to Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he studied city planning at Harvard University&#x27;s Graduate School of Design. Gehry had always expressed an socialist philosophy for architecture, something that was influenced by political views as he expressed a more leftist attitude to the world. These progressive ideas about socially responsible architecture were under-realized and not respected by his professors at Harvard, leaving him to feel disheartened and &quot;underwhelmed&quot;. Gehry&#x27;s distaste for the school culminated after he was invited by his architecture professor to engage in a discussion revolving around a &quot;secret architectural project in progress.&quot; Which was ultimately revealed to Gehry as a palace that he was designing for Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista.

==Career==


Gehry ultimately dropped out of his graduate program at Harvard University (where he studied urban planning) to start a furniture manufacturing company Easy Edges, which specialised in creating pieces with cardboard.

He returned to Los Angeles to work for Victor Gruen Associates, with whom he had apprenticed while at USC. In 1957, at age 28, he was given the chance to design his first private residence with friend and old classmate Greg Walsh. Construction was done by another neighbor across the street from his wife&#x27;s family, Charlie Sockler. Built in Idyllwild, California for his wife Anita&#x27;s family neighbor Melvin David, the over &quot;David Cabin&quot; shows features that were to become synonymous with Gehry&#x27;s later work, including beams protruding from the exterior sides, vertical-grain douglas fir detail, and exposed unfinished ceiling beams. It also shows strong Asian influences, stemming from his earliest inspirations, such as the Shōsōin in Nara, Japan.

In 1961, Gehry moved to Paris, where he worked for architect Andre Remondet. In 1962, he established a practice in Los Angeles that became Frank Gehry and Associates in 1967, then Gehry Partners in 2001. His earliest commissions were in Southern California, where he designed a number of innovative commercial structures such as Santa Monica Place (1980) and residential buildings such as the eccentric Norton House (1984) in Venice, Los Angeles.

Among these works, Gehry&#x27;s most notable design may be the renovation of his own Santa Monica residence. Originally built in 1920 and purchased by Gehry in 1977, it features a metallic exterior wrapped around the original building that leaves many of the original details visible. Gehry still resides there.

Other of Gehry&#x27;s buildings completed during the 1980s include the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium (1981) in San Pedro, and the California Aerospace Museum (1984) at the California Museum of Science and Industry in Los Angeles.

In 1989, Gehry received the Pritzker Architecture Prize, where the jury described him: &quot;Always open to experimentation, he has as well a sureness and maturity that resists, in the same way that Picasso did, being bound either by critical acceptance or his successes. His buildings are juxtaposed collages of spaces and materials that make users appreciative of both the theatre and the back-stage, simultaneously revealed.&quot;

Gehry continued to design other notable buildings in California, such as the Chiat/Day Building (1991) in Venice, in collaboration with Claes Oldenburg, which is well known for its massive sculpture of binoculars. He also began receiving larger national and international commissions, including his first European commission, the Vitra International Furniture Manufacturing Facility and Design Museum in Germany, completed in 1989. It was soon followed by other major commissions including the Frederick Weisman Museum of Art (1993) in Minneapolis, Minnesota; the Cinémathèque Française(1994) in Paris, originally The American Center in Paris; and the Dancing House (1996) in Prague.

From 1994 to 1996 a couple buildings by Gehry for a Public housing project were realized in Goldstein, part of Frankfurt-Schwanheim (1994)
In 1997, Gehry vaulted to a new level of international acclaim when the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao opened in Bilbao, Spain. Hailed by &quot;The New Yorker&quot; as a &quot;masterpiece of the 20th century&quot;, and by legendary architect Philip Johnson as &quot;the greatest building of our time&quot;, the museum became famous for its striking yet aesthetically pleasing design and its positive economic effect on the city.

Since then, Gehry has regularly won major commissions and established himself as one of the world&#x27;s most notable architects. His best-received works include several concert halls for classical music. The boisterous, curvaceous Walt Disney Concert Hall (2003) in downtown Los Angeles is the centerpiece of the neighborhood&#x27;s revitalization; the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it &quot;the most effective answer to doubters, naysayers, and grumbling critics an American architect has ever produced&quot;. Gehry also designed the open-air Jay Pritzker Pavilion (2004) in Chicago&#x27;s Millennium Park; and the understated New World Center (2011) in Miami Beach, which the &quot;LA Times&quot; called &quot;a piece of architecture that dares you to underestimate it or write it off at first glance.&quot;

His other notable works include academic buildings such as the Stata Center (2004) at MIT, and the Peter B. Lewis Library (2008) at Princeton University; museums such as the Museum of Pop Culture (2000) in Seattle, Washington; commercial buildings such as the IAC Building (2007) in New York City; and residential buildings, such as Gehry&#x27;s first skyscraper, the Beekman Tower at 8 Spruce Street (2011) in New York City.

Gehry&#x27;s recent major international works include the Dr Chau Chak Wing Building at the University of Technology Sydney, completed in 2014, and the Chau Chak Wing, with its 320,000 bricks in &quot;sweeping lines&quot;, described as &quot;10 out of 10&quot; on a scale of difficulty. An ongoing project is the Guggenheim Abu Dhabi on Saadiyat Island in the United Arab Emirates. Other significant projects such as the Mirvish Towers in Toronto, and a multi-decade renovation of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, are currently in the design stage. In October 2013, Gehry was appointed joint architect with Foster + Partners to design the High Street phase of the development of Battersea Power Station in London, Gehry&#x27;s first project there.

In recent years, some of Gehry&#x27;s more prominent designs have failed to go forward. In addition to unrealized designs for the Corcoran Art Gallery expansion in Washington, DC, and a new Guggenheim museum near the South Street Seaport in New York City, Gehry was notoriously dropped by developer Bruce Ratner from the Pacific Park (Brooklyn) redevelopment project, and in 2014 as the designer of the World Trade Center Performing Arts Center in New York City. Some stalled projects have recently shown progress: After many years and a dismissal, Gehry was recently reinstated as architect for the Grand Avenue Project in Los Angeles, and though his controversial design of the National Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial in Washington, DC has had numerous delays during the approval process with the United States Congress, it was finally approved in 2014 with a modified design.

In 2014, two significant, long-awaited museums designed by Gehry opened: the Biomuseo, a biodiversity museum in Panama City, Panama; and the Fondation Louis Vuitton, a modern art museum in the Bois de Boulogne park in Paris, France. Both opened to generally positive reviews.

Also in 2014, Gehry was commissioned by River LA (formerly the Los Angeles River Revitalization Corporation), a nonprofit group founded by the city of Los Angeles in 2009 to coordinate river policy, to devise a wide-ranging new plan for the river.

In February 2015, the new AU$180 million building for the University of Technology Sydney was officially opened, whose façade has more than 320,000 hand-placed bricks and glass slabs. Gehry said he would not design a building like the &quot;crumpled paper bag&quot; again.

Gehry told the French newspaper &quot;La Croix&quot; in November 2016 that President of France François Hollande had assured him he could relocate to France if Donald Trump was elected President of the United States. The following month, Gehry said that he had no plans to move. Trump and he exchanged words in 2010 when Gehry&#x27;s 8 Spruce Street, originally known as Beekman Tower, was built taller than the nearby Trump Building, which until then was New York City&#x27;s tallest residential building.

Notable Gehry-designed buildings completed in the 2020s include the Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial in Washington, DC and the LUMA Arles museum in France. In 2021, noting Gehry&#x27;s progress on an increasing number of significant projects in his hometown, including the Grand Avenue Project, a concert hall for the Youth Orchestra Los Angeles, and an office building for Warner Bros., &quot;The Architect&#x27;s Newspaper&quot; stated that &quot;Seventy-four years after he moved there from his native Toronto, L.A. is looking more and more like Gehry Country.&quot;

== Architectural style ==
Said to &quot;defy categorisation&quot;, Gehry&#x27;s work reflects a spirit of experimentation coupled with a respect for the demands of professional practice, and has remained largely unaligned with broader stylistic tendencies or movements. With his earliest educational influences rooted in modernism, Gehry&#x27;s work has sought to escape modernist stylistic tropes while remaining interested in some of its underlying transformative agendas. Continually working between given circumstances and unanticipated materializations, he has been assessed as someone who &quot;made us produce buildings that are fun, sculpturally exciting, good experiences&quot;, although his approach may become &quot;less relevant as pressure mounts to do more with less&quot;.

Gehry&#x27;s style at times seems unfinished or even crude, but his work is consistent with the California &quot;funk&quot; art movement of the 1960s and early 1970s, which featured the use of inexpensive found objects and nontraditional media such as clay to make serious art. His works always have at least some element of deconstructivism; he has been called &quot;the apostle of chain-link fencing and corrugated metal siding&quot;. However, a retrospective exhibit at New York&#x27;s Whitney Museum in 1988 revealed that he is also a sophisticated classical artist who knows European art history and contemporary sculpture and painting.

=== Early influences and design philosophy ===
Frank Gehry has often described architecture as inherently sculptural, asserting, &quot;“I always thought that architecture was, by definition, a three-dimensional object, therefore sculpture.”&quot; This perspective reflects his commitment to blending artistic and architectural disciplines. Gehry’s early work with sculptors influenced his experimental approach, which includes deconstructing traditional architectural forms and embracing ideas of flow and defamiliarization, akin to Viktor Shklovsky’s concept of “laying bare the device.” Critics often describe his work as embodying structuralism rather than traditional formalism.

=== Cultural and personal influences ===
Gehry’s Jewish heritage and immigrant background have shaped his architectural philosophy. He often reinterprets traditional forms in ways that reflect his multicultural experience. His works have been described as embodying &quot;“a critique of consumerism”&quot; by defying expectations of luxury and focusing on creativity. For Gehry, architecture is not just about creating buildings but about crafting spaces that inspire and challenge societal norms. 

== Material innovation ==
A hallmark of Gehry’s style is his innovative use of materials. He challenges architectural norms by incorporating unconventional elements such as corrugated steel, chain-link fencing, and plywood. His works are celebrated for their &quot;“raw aesthetic”&quot; that combines everyday materials in unexpected ways, creating structures that blur the line between functionality and artistry. These material choices also reflect a critique of luxury, emphasizing creativity over opulence.

===Bilbao effect===

The term &quot;Bilbao Effect&quot; emerged in urban planning to describe the transformative impact of Gehry’s architecture. His design for the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, revitalized the city, serving as a prime example of how architecture can drive economic and cultural renewal. The museum’s dramatic curves and shimmering titanium panels are defining features of Gehry’s style, emphasizing movement and fluidity. 

After the phenomenal success of Gehry&#x27;s design for the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, critics began referring to the economic and cultural revitalization of cities through iconic, innovative architecture as the &quot;Bilbao effect&quot;. In the first 12 months after the museum was opened, an estimated US$160 million were added to the Basque economy. Indeed, over $3.5 billion have been added to the Basque economy since the building opened. In subsequent years there have been many attempts to replicate this effect through large-scale eye-catching architectural commissions that have been both successful and unsuccessful, such as Daniel Libeskind&#x27;s expansion of the Denver Art Museum and buildings by Gehry himself, such as the almost universally well-received Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles and the more controversial Museum of Pop Culture in Seattle. Though some link the concept of the Bilbao effect to the notion of starchitecture, Gehry has consistently rejected the label of a starchitect.

== Time management and client interaction ==
Despite the complexity of his designs, Gehry’s approach to project management is highly disciplined. He has been praised for listening closely to clients and translating their needs into visionary designs. As one collaborator noted, “Sometimes he produces something for the client that they don’t realize they want because he listens so well.” Gehry himself credits curiosity as a cornerstone of his process, stating, “You’re being curious. And that curiosity leads to invention.” 

===Criticism===
Though much of Gehry&#x27;s work has been well-received, its reception was not always positive. In 2014, &quot;Gizmodo&quot;&#x27;s Geoff Manaugh called Gehry &quot;the the world&#x27;s worst living architect,&quot; saying he is the &quot;multi-billion dollar equivalent of a Salvador Dalì poster tacked to the wall in a stoned lacrosse player’s dorm room.&quot;

Art historian Hal Foster reads Gehry&#x27;s architecture as, primarily, in the service of corporate branding. Criticism of his work includes complaints over design flaws that the buildings waste structural resources by creating functionless forms, do not seem to belong in their surroundings or enhance the public context of their locations, and are apparently designed without taking into account the local climate.

Moreover, socialist magazine &quot;Jacobin&quot; pointed out that Gehry&#x27;s work can be summed up as architecture for the super-wealthy, in the sense that it is expensive, not resourceful, and does not serve the interests of the overwhelming majority. The article criticized Gehry&#x27;s statement, &quot;In the world we live in, 98 percent of what gets built and designed today is pure shit&quot;.

==Academia and design career==

===Academia===
In January 2011, Gehry joined the University of Southern California (USC) faculty, as the Judge Widney Professor of Architecture. He has since continued in this role at his alma mater. He has also held teaching positions at Harvard University, the University of California at Los Angeles, the University of Toronto, Columbia University, the Federal Institute of Technology in Zürich, and at Yale University, where he still teaches as of 2017.

Though he is often referred to as a &quot;starchitect&quot;, he has repeatedly expressed his disdain for the term, insisting he is only an architect. Steve Sample, President of the University of Southern California, told Gehry that &quot;...After George Lucas, you are our most prominent graduate&quot;.

, Gehry has received over a dozen honorary university degrees (see #Honorary doctorates).

In February 2017, MasterClass announced an online architecture course taught by Gehry that was released that July.

===Exhibition design===
Gehry has been involved in exhibition designs at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art dating back to the 1960s. In 1965, Gehry designed the exhibition display for the &quot;Art Treasures of Japan&quot; exhibition at the LACMA. This was followed soon after by the exhibition design for the &quot;Assyrian Reliefs&quot; show in 1966 and the &quot;Billy Al Bengston Retrospective&quot; in 1968. The LACMA then had Gehry design the installation for the &quot;Treasures of Tutankhamen&quot; exhibition in 1978 followed by the &quot;Avant-Garde in Russia 1910–1930&quot; exhibition in 1980. The subsequent year, Gehry designed the exhibition for &quot;Seventeen Artists in the &#x27;60s&quot; at the LACMA, followed soon after by the &quot;German Expressionist Sculpture Exhibition&quot; in 1983. In 1991–92, Gehry designed the installation of the landmark exhibition &quot;Degenerate Art: The Fate of the Avant-Garde in Nazi Germany&quot;, which opened at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and traveled to the Art Institute of Chicago, the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, and the Altes Museum in Berlin. Gehry was asked to design an exhibition on the work of Alexander Calder at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art&#x27;s Resnick Pavilion, again invited by the museum&#x27;s curator Stephanie Barron. The exhibition began on November 24, 2013, and ran through July 27, 2014.

In addition to his long-standing involvement with exhibition design at the LACMA, Gehry has also designed numerous exhibition installations with other institutions. In 1998, &quot;The Art of the Motorcycle&quot; exhibition opened at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum with its installation designed by Gehry. This exhibition subsequently traveled to the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao and the Guggenheim Las Vegas.

In 2014, he curated an exhibition of photography by his close friend and businessman Peter Arnell that ran from March 5 through April 1 at Milk Studios Gallery in Los Angeles.

===Stage design===
In 1983, Gehry created the stage design for Lucinda Childs&#x27; dance &quot;Available Light&quot;, set to music by John Adams. It premiered at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles at the &quot;Temporary Contemporary&quot;, and was subsequently seen at the Brooklyn Academy of Music Opera House in New York City and the Theatre de la Ville in Paris. The set consisted of two levels angled in relation to each other, with a chain-link backdrop. The piece was revived in 2015, and was performed, among other places, in Los Angeles and Philadelphia, where it was presented by FringeArts, which commissioned the revival.

In 2012, Gehry designed the set for the Los Angeles Philharmonic&#x27;s opera production of &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, performed at the Walt Disney Concert Hall.

In April 2014, Gehry designed a set for an &quot;exploration of the life and career of Pierre Boulez&quot; by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, which was performed in November of that year.

===Other designs===

In addition to architecture, Gehry has made a line of furniture for Knoll and for Heller Furniture, jewelry for Tiffany &amp; Co., various household items, sculptures, and even a glass bottle for Wyborowa Vodka. His first line of furniture, produced from 1969 to 1973, was called &quot;Easy Edges&quot;, constructed out of cardboard. Another line of furniture released in the spring of 1992 is &quot;Bentwood Furniture&quot;. Each piece is named after a different hockey term. He was first introduced to making furniture in 1954 while serving in the U.S. Army, where he designed furniture for enlisted soldiers.

In many of his designs, Gehry is inspired by fish. &quot;It was by accident I got into the fish image&quot;, claimed Gehry. One thing that sparked his interest in fish was the fact that his colleagues were recreating Greek temples. He said, &quot;Three hundred million years before man was fish...if you gotta go back, and you&#x27;re insecure about going forward...go back three hundred million years ago. Why are you stopping at the Greeks? So, I started drawing fish in my sketchbook, and then I started to realize that there was something in it.&quot;

As a result of his fascination, the first Fish Lamps were fabricated between 1984 and 1986. They employed wire armatures molded into fish shapes, onto which shards of plastic laminate ColorCore are individually glued. Since the creation of the first lamp in 1984, the fish has become a recurrent motif in Gehry&#x27;s work, most notably in the &quot;Fish Sculpture&quot; at La Vila Olímpica del Poblenou in Barcelona (1989–92) and &quot;Standing Glass Fish&quot; for the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden (1986).

Gehry has previously collaborated with luxury jewelry company Tiffany &amp; Co., creating six distinct jewelry collections: the Orchid, Fish, Torque, Equus, Axis, and Fold collections. In addition to jewelry, Gehry designed other items, including a distinctive collector&#x27;s chess set and a series of tableware items, including vases, cups, and bowls for the company.

In 2004, Gehry designed the official trophy for the World Cup of Hockey. He redesigned the trophy for the next tournament in 2016.

He has collaborated with American furniture manufacturer Emeco on designs such as the 2004 &quot;Superlight&quot; chair.

In 2014, Gehry was one of the six &quot;iconoclasts&quot; selected by French fashion house Louis Vuitton to design a piece using their iconic monogram pattern as part of their &quot;Celebrating Monogram&quot; campaign.

In 2015, Gehry designed his first yacht.

In 2020, Gehry designed a limited edition bottle of Hennessy cognac.

===Software development===
Gehry&#x27;s firm was responsible for innovation in architectural software. His firm spun off another firm called Gehry Technologies that was established in 2002. In 2005, Gehry Technologies began a partnership with Dassault Systèmes to bring innovations from the aerospace and manufacturing world to AEC and developed Digital Project software, as well as GTeam software. In 2014, Gehry Technologies was acquired by software company Trimble Navigation. Its client list includes Diller Scofidio + Renfro, Herzog &amp; de Meuron, Jean Nouvel, Coop Himmelb(l)au, and Zaha Hadid.

==Personal life==
A naturalized U.S. citizen, he also remains a citizen of Canada. He lives in Santa Monica, California, and continues to practice out of Los Angeles. Having grown up in Canada, he is an avid fan of ice hockey. He began a hockey league, FOG (for Frank Owen Gehry), in his office, though he no longer plays with them. In 2004, he designed the trophy for the World Cup of Hockey. 

Gehry is known for his occasional bad temper. During a trip to Oviedo, Spain to accept the Prince of Asturias Award in October 2014, he received a significant amount of attention, both positive and negative, for publicly flipping off a reporter at a press conference who accused him of being a &quot;showy&quot; architect.

Gehry is a member of the California Yacht Club in Marina Del Rey, and enjoys sailing with his fiberglass-hulled yacht, &quot;Foggy&quot;. He also serves on the leadership council of The New York Stem Cell Foundation.

==In popular culture==
In 2004, Gehry voiced himself in an episode of the children&#x27;s TV show &quot;Arthur&quot;, where he helped Arthur and his friends design a new treehouse. He also voiced himself in a 2005 episode of &quot;The Simpsons,&quot; &quot;The Seven-Beer Snitch&quot;, where he designs a concert hall for the fictional city of Springfield. He has since said he regrets the appearance, as it included a joke about his design technique that has led people to misunderstand his architectural process.

In 2006, filmmaker Sydney Pollack made a documentary about Gehry&#x27;s work, &quot;Sketches of Frank Gehry,&quot; which followed Gehry over five years and painted a positive portrait of his character; it was well-received critically.

In 2009, architecture-inspired ice cream sandwich company Coolhaus named a cookie and ice cream combination after Gehry. Dubbed the &quot;Frank Behry&quot;, it features Strawberries &amp; Cream gelato and snickerdoodle cookies.

==Works==
===Exhibitions===
In October 2014, the first major European exhibition of Gehry&#x27;s work debuted at the Centre Pompidou in Paris. Other museums and major galleries that have held exhibitions on Gehry&#x27;s architecture and design include the Leo Castelli Gallery in 1983; and the Walker Art Center in 1986, whose exhibition then traveled to the Toronto Harbourfront Museum, the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston, the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, the LACMA and the Whitney Museum. Museums with exhibitions on Gehry&#x27;s work have included the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art (1992), the Gagosian Gallery (1984, 1992 and 1993), the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum (2001), the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao (2002), the Jewish Museum in Manhattan (2010), and the Milan Triennale (first in 1988, then in 2010 with an exhibition entitled &quot;Frank Gehry from 1997&quot;), and LACMA (2015).

Gehry participated in the 1980 Venice Biennale&#x27;s &quot;La Strada Novissima&quot; installation. He also contributed to the 1985 Venice Biennale with an installation and performance named &quot;Il Corso del Coltello,&quot; in collaboration with Claes Oldenburg. His projects were featured in the 1996 event, and contributed to the 2008 event with the installation &quot;Ungapatchket&quot;.

In October 2015, 21 21 Design Sight in Tokyo held the exhibition &quot;Frank Gehry. I Have An Idea&quot;, curated by Japanese architect Tsuyoshi Tane.

In 2021, the Gagosian Gallery in Beverly Hills held &quot;Spinning Tales&quot;, an exhibition of new fish sculptures by Gehry.

<text>Cass Gilbert (November 24, 1859 – May 17, 1934) was an American architect. An early proponent of skyscrapers, his works include the Woolworth Building, the United States Supreme Court building, the state capitols of Minnesota, Arkansas, and West Virginia, the Detroit Public Library, the Saint Louis Art Museum and Public Library. His public buildings in the Beaux Arts style reflect the optimistic American sense that the nation was heir to Greek democracy, Roman law and Renaissance humanism. Gilbert&#x27;s achievements were recognized in his lifetime; he served as president of the American Institute of Architects in 1908–09.

Gilbert was a conservative who believed architecture should reflect historic traditions and the established social order. His design of the new Supreme Court building in 1935, with its classical lines and small size, contrasted sharply with the large federal buildings along the National Mall in Washington, D.C., which he disliked.

Architectural historian Margaret Heilbrun said that &quot;Gilbert&#x27;s pioneering buildings injected vitality into skyscraper design, and his &#x27;Gothic skyscraper,&#x27; epitomized by the Woolworth Building, profoundly influenced architects during the first decades of the twentieth century.&quot; Historians Christen and Flanders wrote that his reputation among architectural critics went into eclipse during the age of modernism, but has since rebounded because of &quot;respect for the integrity and classic beauty of his masterworks&quot;.

== Early life ==
Gilbert was born in Zanesville, Ohio, the middle of three sons, and was named after the statesman Lewis Cass, to whom he was distantly related. Gilbert&#x27;s father General Samuel A. Gilbert was a Union veteran of the American Civil War and a surveyor for the United States Coast Survey. His uncle was Union General Charles Champion Gilbert. When he was nine, Gilbert&#x27;s family moved to St. Paul, Minnesota, where he was raised by his mother after his father died. Cass was raised Presbyterian. He attended preparatory school but dropped out of Macalester College. He began his architectural career at age 17 by joining the Abraham M. Radcliffe office in St. Paul. In 1878, Gilbert enrolled in the architecture program at MIT.

== Minnesota career ==
Gilbert worked for a time with the firm of McKim, Mead &amp; White before starting a practice in St. Paul with James Knox Taylor. He was commissioned to design a number of railroad stations, including those in Anoka, Willmar and the extant Little Falls depot, all in Minnesota. As a Minnesota architect he was best known for his design of the Minnesota State Capitol and the downtown St. Paul Endicott Building. His goal was to move to New York City and gain a national reputation, but he remained in Minnesota from 1882 until 1898. Many of his Minnesota buildings are still standing, including more than a dozen private residences (especially those on St. Paul&#x27;s Summit Avenue), several churches featuring rich textures and colors, resort summer homes, and warehouses.

==National reputation==
The completion of the Minnesota capitol gave Gilbert his national reputation and in 1898 he permanently moved his base to New York. His breakthrough commission was the design of the Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House in New York City, which now houses the George Gustav Heye Center. Gilbert served on the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts from 1910 to 1916. In 1906 he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an associate member, and became a full academician in 1908. Gilbert served as president of the academy from 1926 to 1933. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1934.

He was a trustee of the Carnegie Institution from 1924 until he died in 1934.

== Historical impact ==

Gilbert was a skyscraper pioneer; when designing the Woolworth Building he moved into unproven ground — though he certainly was aware of the ground-breaking work done by Chicago architects on skyscrapers and once discussed merging firms with the legendary Daniel Burnham — and his technique of cladding a steel frame became the model for decades. Modernists embraced his work: artist John Marin painted it several times; even Frank Lloyd Wright praised the lines of the building, though he decried the ornamentation.

Gilbert was one of the first celebrity architects in America, designing skyscrapers in New York City and Cincinnati, campus buildings at Oberlin College and the University of Texas at Austin, state capitols in Minnesota and West Virginia, the support towers of the George Washington Bridge, railroad stations (including the New Haven Union Station, 1920), and the United States Supreme Court building in Washington, D.C. His reputation declined among some professionals during the age of Modernism, but he was on the design committee that guided and eventually approved the modernist design of Manhattan&#x27;s groundbreaking Rockefeller Center. Gilbert&#x27;s body of work as a whole is more eclectic than many critics admit. In particular, his Union Station in New Haven lacks the embellishments common of the Beaux-Arts period and contains the simple lines common in Modernism.

Gilbert wrote to a colleague, &quot;I sometimes wish I had never built the Woolworth Building because I fear it may be regarded as my only work and you and I both know that whatever it may be in dimension and in certain lines it is after all only a skyscraper.&quot;

Gilbert&#x27;s two buildings on the University of Texas at Austin campus, Sutton Hall (1918) and Battle Hall (1911), are recognized by architectural historians as among the finest works of architecture in the state. Designed in a Spanish-Mediterranean revival style, the two buildings became the stylistic basis for the later expansion of the university in the 1920s and 1930s and helped popularize the style throughout Texas.

== Archives ==
Gilbert&#x27;s drawings and correspondence are preserved at the New-York Historical Society, the Minnesota Historical Society, the University of Minnesota, and the Library of Congress.

== Notable works ==

* Saint Paul Seminary, Saint Paul, Minnesota.
** Cretin Hall, Loras Hall, a gymnasium (now the Service Center), a classroom building, the refectory building, and the administration building in 1894 were commissioned by James J. Hill. Cretin and the Service Center no longer stand as of 2024, on the University of St. Thomas (Minnesota) campus, as they were torn down to build a controversial new hockey/basketball arena.
* Minnesota State Capitol, Saint Paul, Minnesota, 1895–1905.
** Designed in High Renaissance style, the building is not a replica of the United States Capitol. Local newspapers made a fuss when Gilbert sent to Georgia for marble, but the result, in which a hemispherical dome caps a high drum not unlike that of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica, crowning a building housing the bicameral legislature and the state supreme court, was so nobly handsome that West Virginia and Arkansas contracted for Gilbert capitols as well. Its brick dome is held in hoops of steel.
* St. Clement&#x27;s Episcopal Church, St. Paul, Minnesota, 1895.
** Designed in the traditional English country church style, with a lychgate and close, bell tower, and parish hall (renovated in 2006). Funded by a generous donation from Mrs. Theodore Eaton, widow of the rector of St. Clement&#x27;s Episcopal Church in New York City. Includes original furniture, baptismal font, encaustic tile floor in choir, elaborate rood screen, linen-fold paneling, and parquet oak floor in sanctuary. The altar features Tiffany Studios stained glass window depicting the empty cross.
* St. John the Divine Episcopal Church, 120 8th Street S., Moorhead, Minnesota, 1898–99
* Northern Pacific Railway Depot, 701 Main Street, Fargo, North Dakota, 1898.
* The Broadway-Chambers Building (277 Broadway), Manhattan, 1899–1900.
** Gilbert&#x27;s first building in New York City.
* Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House, Manhattan, 1902–1907.
** Facing Bowling Green park in Lower Manhattan
* Essex County Veterans Courthouse, Newark, 1904
* Saint Louis Art Museum (Palace of the Fine Arts), St. Louis, Missouri, 1904.
** Built for the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis and the only major building of the fair built as a permanent structure.
* 90 West Street, Manhattan, 1905–1907.
** Severely damaged during the September 11, 2001 attacks, this building in lower Manhattan has since been completely restored.
* Metals Bank Building, Butte, Montana, 1906.
** Commissioned by F. Augustus Heinze, this eight-story low-rise building has an internal steel frame. It was the second to be built in Butte after the 1901 Hirbour Building, which also has eight stories.
* A series of master plans for the Minneapolis campus of the University of Minnesota, 1907.
*Designs for 12 local stations on the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad in the Bronx and Westchester County, New York, 1908. Not all were built, and only four were extant in 2014, all in the Bronx: the Westchester Avenue station and Bartow station are in ruins, and the Morris Park and Hunts Point stations have been converted to other uses. All ceased to be used as railroad stations by the late 1930s.
* Spalding Building, Portland, Oregon, 1911.
** A 12-story early skyscraper based on the construction principles of a classical column.
* Battle Hall, Austin, Texas, 1911.
** For the University of Texas at Austin.
* New Haven Free Public Library, Mary E. Ives Memorial Library
** At the corner of Elm and Temple Streets in downtown New Haven, architect Gilbert designed the brick and marble building to harmonize with the traditional architecture of New Haven, and especially with the United Church nearby. The building was formally dedicated to the City of New Haven on May 27, 1911.
* Kelsey Building, Trenton, New Jersey, 1911.
** Built by Henry Cooper Kelsey as a memorial to his wife. Now used by Thomas Edison State University.
* St. Louis Public Library, St. Louis, Missouri, 1912
** The main library for the city&#x27;s public library system, in a severe classicizing style, has an oval central pavilion surrounded by four light courts. The outer facades of the free-standing building are of lightly rusticated Maine granite. The Olive Street front is disposed like a colossal arcade, with contrasting marble bas-relief panels. A projecting three-bay central block, like a pared-down triumphal arch, provides a monumental entrance. At the rear the Central Library faced a sunken garden. The interiors feature some light-transmitting glass floors. The ceiling of the Periodicals Room is modified from Michelangelo&#x27;s ceiling in the Laurentian Library.
* Woolworth Building, Manhattan, New York, 1913.
** A Gothic Revival skyscraper clad in glazed terracotta panels, it was the tallest building in the world when built. Bas-reliefs in the lobby depict Woolworth and Gilbert with Woolworth holding nickels and dimes.
* Fourth and Vine Tower, Cincinnati, Ohio, 1913.
** Originally built as the headquarters for the Union Central Life Insurance Company.
* Austin, Nichols and Company Warehouse, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, New York, 1915.
* Fountain, Ridgefield, Connecticut, 1914–16.
** This fountain, at the intersection of Routes 35 and 33, was designed and donated to the town by Cass Gilbert, who had a summer home (Keeler Tavern) within sight of the intersection. In 2004, a drunk driver crashed into the fountain, heavily damaging it; the fountain was rebuilt, raised higher, and surrounded by protective plantings, and it is still functioning today.
* Four buildings at Oberlin College, Oberlin, Ohio
** Gilbert designed four buildings at Oberlin: Finney Chapel (1909), the Cox Administration Building (1915), the Allen Memorial Art Museum, and Bosworth Hall (1931). He enjoyed a close working relationship with Oberlin&#x27;s president Henry Churchill King, but his relationship with Oberlin deteriorated after King retired in 1927 and most of the design work and construction supervision of Bosworth Hall and its residential quadrangle was done by Gilbert&#x27;s son Cass Jr., who had earlier supervised the construction of the Allen Memorial Hospital (1924) in Oberlin (now Mercy Allen Medical Center).
* Rodin Studios, Midtown Manhattan, New York, 1916–1917.
* Chase Headquarters Building, Waterbury, Connecticut, 1917–1919.
** This building was designed as the headquarters of the Chase Company and forms part of the Waterbury Municipal Center Complex, a unique concentration of Gilbert&#x27;s architecture comprising the Waterbury City Hall, the Chase Bank Building and the Chase company headquarters, Chase&#x27;s house, a dispensary and Lincoln House, a headquarters building for the city&#x27;s charities.
* G. Fox &amp; Co. department store, Hartford, Connecticut, 1918.
* Brooklyn Army Terminal, Sunset Park, Brooklyn, New York, 1919.
* Freedman&#x27;s Bank Building (previously known as the Treasury Annex), Lafayette Square, Washington, D.C., 1919.

** headquarters for Prudential Insurance in Newark
* 130 West 30th Street, &quot;The Cass Gilbert,&quot; 1927–1928.
** Formerly offices and manufacturing spaces for businesses in the fur trade, now a luxury residential condominium.

*Thurgood Marshall United States Courthouse, Manhattan, 1933.
*The Seaside, Waterford, Connecticut, 1934.
* United States Supreme Court Building, Washington, D.C., 1935.
** Gilbert&#x27;s last major project, guided to completion by his son, Cass Gilbert Jr. He died a year before it was completed. A vast Roman temple in the Corinthian order is penetrated by a cross range articulated with pilasters in very low relief. The central tablet in the richly sculpted frieze reads . His design for the U.S. Supreme Court chambers was based upon his design for the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals at the state capitol in Charleston. The pediment sculptures Liberty attended by order and Authority (great lawgivers Moses, Confucius, and Solon are on the West Portico) were executed by Hermon Atkins MacNeil.

== Name confusion with C. P. H. Gilbert ==
Cass Gilbert is often confused with another prominent New York architect of the time, Charles Pierrepont Henry Gilbert, in part because Frank W. Woolworth engaged both; Cass Gilbert designed the famous Woolworth Building skyscraper on Broadway, while C. P. H. Gilbert designed Woolworth&#x27;s personal mansion.

The Ukrainian Institute building on Manhattan&#x27;s 5th Avenue, the work of C. P. H. Gilbert, is often incorrectly attributed to Cass Gilbert.

Cass Gilbert is sometimes also confused with his son, architect Cass Gilbert Jr.

<doc id="53408" wikidata="Q314636" url="?curid=53408" title="Michael Graves">
<text>Michael Graves (July 9, 1934 – March 12, 2015) was an American architect, designer, and educator, and principal of Michael Graves and Associates and Michael Graves Design Group. He was a member of The New York Five and the Memphis Group and a professor of architecture at Princeton University for nearly forty years. Following his own partial paralysis in 2003, Graves became an internationally recognized advocate of health care design.

Graves&#x27; global portfolio of architectural work ranged from the Ministry of Culture in The Hague, a post office for Celebration, Florida, a prominent expansion of the Denver Public Library to numerous commissions for Disney and the scaffolding design for the 2000 Washington Monument restoration. He was recognized for his influence on architectural movements, including New Urbanism, New Classicism, and postmodernism. His postmodern buildings include the Portland Building in Portland, Oregon and the Humana Building in Louisville, Kentucky.

For his architectural work, Graves received a fellowship of the American Institute of Architects as well as its highest award, the AIA Gold Medal (2001). He was trustee of the American Academy in Rome and was the president of its Society of Fellows from 1980 to 1984. He received the American Prize for Architecture, the National Medal of Arts (1999) and the Driehaus Architecture Prize (2012).

Graves produced both high end and mass consumer product designs for several companies, including Alessi in Italy and Target and J. C. Penney in the United States. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Graves as &quot;one of the most prominent and prolific American architects of the latter 20th century, who designed more than 350 buildings around the world but was perhaps best known for [a] teakettle and pepper mill.&quot;

==Early life and education==
Graves was born on July 9, 1934, in Indianapolis, Indiana, to Erma (née Lowe) and Thomas B. Graves. He grew up in the city&#x27;s suburbs and later credited his mother for suggesting that he become an engineer or an architect.

Graves graduated from Indianapolis&#x27;s Broad Ripple High School in 1952 and earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in architecture in 1958 from the University of Cincinnati. During college he also became a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity. Graves earned a master&#x27;s degree in architecture from Harvard University in 1959.

After graduation from college, Graves spent a year working in George Nelson&#x27;s office. Nelson, a furniture designer and the creative director for Herman Miller, exposed Graves to the work of fellow designers Charles and Ray Eames and Alexander Girard. In 1960 Graves won the American Academy in Rome&#x27;s Prix de Rome (Rome Prize) and spent the next two years at the academy in Italy. Graves describes himself as &quot;transformed&quot; by his experience in Rome: &quot;I discovered new ways of seeing and analyzing both architecture and landscape.&quot;

==Career==

Graves began his career in 1962 as a professor of architecture at Princeton University, where he taught for nearly four decades and later helped to establish the Michael Graves College at Kean University in Union Township, New Jersey, and established his own architectural firm in 1964 at Princeton, New Jersey. Graves worked as an architect in public practice designing a variety of buildings that included private residences, university buildings, hotel resorts, hospitals, retail and commercial office buildings, museums, civic buildings, and monuments. During a career that spanned nearly fifty years, Graves and his firm designed more than 350 buildings around the world, and an estimated 2,000 household products.

===Princeton University===
In 1962, after two years of studies in Rome, Graves returned to the United States and moved to Princeton, New Jersey, where he accepted a professorship at the Princeton University School of Architecture. Graves taught at Princeton for thirty-nine years while simultaneously practicing architecture. He retired as the Robert Schirmer Professor of Architecture, Emeritus, in 2001.

Although Graves was a longtime faculty member at Princeton and trained many of its architecture students, the university did not allow its faculty to practice their profession on its campus. As a result, Graves was never commissioned to design a building for the university. Later in his life he contributed to the founding of a new college, which bears his name at Kean University.

===Architect===
In his early years as an architect, Graves did designs for home renovation projects in Princeton. In 1964 he founded the architectural firm of Michael Graves &amp; Associate in Princeton and remained in public practice there until the end of his life. His firm maintained offices in Princeton, New Jersey, and in New York City, but his residence in Princeton served as his design studio, home office and library, and a place to display the many objects he collected during his world travels. Nicknamed &quot;The Warehouse&quot;, it also displayed many of the household items he designed. After Graves&#x27;s death, Kean University acquired his former home and studio in Princeton, along with two adjacent buildings.

====Modernist====
Graves spent much of the late 1960s and early 1970s designing modernist residences.

His first commission was the Hanselman House in Fort Wayne, Indiana, a design completed in 1971. The modernist structure built for $55,000 received an American Institute of Architects Honor Award in 1975. The New York Times described the home as &quot;another of Graves&#x27;s experiments in cubist‐influenced spatial manipulations&quot; and cited the obvious influence of Le Corbusier on Graves&#x27; work.

Built for friends he met in high school, the home went up for sale in 2017 for $264,888. The four-bedroom residence features a Graves-painted mural in the living room signed by the architect during a visit to the home in 2000.

He also designed the Snyderman House in Fort Wayne (1972, destroyed by fire in 2002) .

Graves also became one of the New York Five, along with Peter Eisenman, Charles Gwathmey, John Hejduk and Richard Meier. This informal group of Princeton and New York City architects, also known as the Whites due to the predominant color of their architectural work, espoused a pure form of modernism characterized by clean lines and minimal ornamentation. The New York Five became the &quot;standard-bearers of a movement to elevate modernist architectural form into a serious theoretical pursuit.&quot; The book, &quot;Five Architects&quot; (1973) describes some of their early work.

====Postmodernist====
In the late 1970s, Graves shifted away from modernism to pursue Postmodernism and New Urbanism design for the remainder of his career. He began by sketching designs that had Cubist-inspired elements and strong, saturated colors. Postmodernism allowed Graves to introduce his humanist vision of classicism, as well as his sense of irony and humor. His designs, notable for their &quot;playful style&quot; and &quot;colorful facades,&quot; were a &quot;radical departure&quot; from his earlier work. The Plocek Residence (1977), a private home in Warren Township, New Jersey, was among the first of his designs in this new style.

Graves designed some of his most iconic buildings in the early 1980s, including the Portland Building. The fifteen-story Portland Municipal Services Building, his first major public commission, opened in 1982 in downtown Portland, Oregon. The &quot;monolithic cube&quot; with decorated facades and colorful, oversized columns is &quot;considered a seminal Postmodern work&quot; and one of Graves&#x27;s best-known works of architecture. The celebrated but controversial municipal office also became an icon for the city of Portland and subject to an ongoing preservation debate. Regarded as the first major built example of postmodern architecture in a tall office building, the Portland Building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2011. Although it faced demolition in 2014, the city government decided to proceed with a renovation, estimated to cost $195 million.

As a result of the notoriety he received from the Portland Building design, Graves was awarded other major commissions in the 1980s and 1990s. Notable buildings from this period include the Humana Building (1982) in Kentucky and the Newark Museum expansion (1982) in New Jersey. Some architecture critics, including Paul Goldberger of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, consider the Humana Building, a skyscraper in Louisville, Kentucky, one of Graves&#x27;s finest building designs. &quot;TIME&quot; magazine also claimed it was a commercial icon for the city of Louisville and one of the best buildings of the 1980s. The San Juan Capistrano Library (1982) in California, another project from this period, shows his interpretation of the Mission Revival style.

Graves and his firm also designed several buildings for the Walt Disney Company in the postmodern style. These include the Team Disney headquarters in Burbank, California; the Dolphin (1987) and Swan (1988) resorts at Walt Disney World in Florida; and Disney&#x27;s Hotel New York (1989) at Disneyland Paris. Patrick Burke, the project architect for the two resort hotels in Florida, commented that the Walt Disney Company described Graves&#x27;s designs as &quot;entertainment architecture.&quot; In addition to the Swan and Dolphin hotel buildings, Graves&#x27;s firm designed their original interiors, furnishings, signage, and artwork. Graves&#x27;s other notable commissions for buildings that were completed in the 1990s include an expansion of the Denver Public Library (1990) and the renovation of the Detroit Institute of Arts (1990).

Postmodern architecture did not have a long-lasting popularity and some of Graves&#x27;s clients rejected his ideas. For example, his design for an expansion of Marcel Breuer&#x27;s Whitney Museum of American Art building in New York City in the mid-1980s was highly contested and never built due to architect and local opposition. Graves&#x27;s designs for a planned Phoenix Municipal Government Center complex were among the project&#x27;s finalists, but his concept was not selected as the winning entry.

Graves&#x27;s prominence as a postmodernist architect may have reached its peak during the 1980s and in the early 1990s, but he continued to practice as an architect until his death in 2015. Later works include the O&#x27;Reilly Theater (1996) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; the NCAA Hall of Champions in Indianapolis, Indiana; and 425 Fifth Avenue (2000) in New York City, among others. Graves also received recognition for his multi-year renovation of his personal residence in Princeton. International projects included the Sheraton Miramar Hotel (1997) in El Gouna, Egypt, and the Hard Rock Hotel in Singapore. One of the last projects that Michael Graves and Associates was involved in before Graves&#x27;s death was the Louwman Museum (2010) in The Hague, Netherlands. Gary Lapera, a principal and studio head of Michael Graves and Associates, designed the museum, also known as the Lowman Collection and the National Automobile Museum of the Netherlands, which houses more than 230 cars.

===Product and furniture designer===

In addition to his architecture, Graves became a noted designer of consumer products. His distinctive style was well known among the general public in the United States in 1980s and 1990s, when he began designing household products for major clients such as the Target Corporation, Alessi, Steuben, and The Walt Disney Company. Over the years, the Michael Graves Design Group, a part of his design firm, designed and brought to market more than 2,000 products.

In the early 1980s, Ettore Sottsass recruited Graves to become a member of Memphis, a postmodern design group based in Milan, Italy. Graves began designing consumer products such as furniture and home accessories. Especially notable is his &quot;Plaza&quot; dressing table. Around the same time, Graves became associated with Alessi, a high-end Italian kitchenware manufacturer. Graves designed a sterling silver tea service for Alessi in 1982, a turning point in his career, and he was no longer known solely as an architect. After the $25,000 tea service began to attract buyers, Alberto Alessi commissioned Graves to design a moderate-priced kettle for his company. In 1985 Graves designed his iconic a stainless-steel teakettle (9093 stovetop kettle).

The kettle featured a red, bird-shaped whistle at the end of the spout. It remained the company&#x27;s top-selling product for fifteen years. In honor of its thirtieth anniversary in 2015, Graves designed a special edition version with a dragon replacing the kettle&#x27;s bird-shaped whistle.
In Italy in 1987, clock on display &quot;Apollodoro Gallery&quot;, seventh event &quot;The Hour of Architects&quot;, with Hans Hollei, Arata Isozaki, Ettore Sottsass, Paolo Portoghesi, paintings by Paolo Salvati, Rome.

In 1997–98, when Graves designed the scaffolding used in the restoration of the Washington Monument in Washington D.C., he met Ron Johnson, a Target executive who appreciated his product designs. (The Target Corporation contributed $6 million toward restoration of the monument.) The result of their acquaintance was the formation of a business relationship between Graves and the U.S. retailer that lasted until 2012. Graves began the collaboration with Target by designing a half-dozen products for the mass-consumer market. His collection of housewares began selling in Target stores in January 1999.

In 1998, Target Corporation commissioned Graves to design a model home to showcase the new line of housewares, but Graves went a step further. He designed &quot;Cedar Gables,&quot; contemporary house in Minnetonka, Minnesota, complete with custom furniture, lighting, fixtures, and other unique items, making it only one of three homes he designed and furnished. By 2009, however, Graves noted that the house &quot;doesn&#x27;t have a wow factor. That gets old quickly.&quot; When the partnership with Target ended in 2012, Graves had designed more than 500 objects for the retailer.

Increasingly concerned about Target&#x27;s dwindling partnerships with outside designers, Graves decided to explore other relationships for marketing his consumer products. After Johnson became CEO of J.C. Penney in 2011, he and Graves reached an agreement for Graves to design products exclusively for Penney&#x27;s. Graves also created products for other manufacturers. In the 1990s for example, Graves created the Mickey Mouse Gourmet Collection for Moeller Design with the Walt Disney Company&#x27;s approval. The collection of kitchenware and tabletop items was initially sold through the Walt Disney Company&#x27;s retail stores and later offered at other retail outlets.

In 2013, Graves designed what became known as the “Hitler teapot” for department store JCPenney, which garnered controversy due to its perceived resemblance to Adolf Hitler.

In addition to housewares, Graves was involved in a variety of other design projects that included sets and costumes for New York City&#x27;s Joffrey Ballet; a shopping bag for Bloomingdale&#x27;s department store; jewelry for Cleto Munari of Milan, Italy; vinyl flooring for Tajima, a Japanese company; and rugs for Vorwerk, a German firm. In 1994 Graves opened a small retail store named the Graves Design Store in Princeton, New Jersey, where shoppers could purchase his designs and reproductions of his artwork. At that time Graves had designed products for more than fifty manufacturers.

==Later years==

Graves retired as a professor of architecture at Princeton University in 2001, but remained active in his architecture and design firm. He also became an advocate for the disabled in the last decade of his life. When Graves became paralyzed from the waist down in 2003, the result of a spinal cord infection, the use of a wheelchair heightened his awareness of the needs of the disabled. After weeks of hospitalization and physical therapy, Graves adapted his home to suit his accessibility needs and resumed his architectural and design work.

In addition to other types of buildings and household products, Graves designed wheelchairs, hospital furnishings, hospitals, and disabled veteran&#x27;s housing. Graves also became a &quot;reluctant health expert,&quot; as well as an internationally recognized advocate for accessible design. In 2013, President Barack Obama appointed Graves to an administrative role in the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (also known as the Access Board). The independent agency addresses accessibility concerns for people with disabilities.

In 2014, a year before his death, Graves helped to establish and plan the Michael Graves College, which includes The School of Public Architecture at Kean University in Union Township, New Jersey. Kean University&#x27;s Bachelor of Arts in Architectural Studies program began in 2015; its Master of Architecture program is slated to begin in 2019. As part of gift from Graves&#x27;s estate, in 2016 the university acquired The Warehouse at 44 Patton Avenue in Princeton, New Jersey, Graves&#x27;s former home and studio, and two adjacent buildings. The university plans to use the facility as an educational research center for its School of Public Architecture, although its main campus and its School of Public Architecture are located about forty miles away in Union, New Jersey.

==Personal life==
Graves&#x27; marriage to Gail Devine in 1955 ended in divorce; his subsequent marriage to Lucy James in 1972 also ended in divorce. Graves was the father of three children, two sons and a daughter.

==Death==
Graves died at his home in Princeton, New Jersey, on March 12, 2015, at the age of 80, and is buried at Princeton Cemetery.

==Legacy==
Graves favored a &quot;humanistic approach to architecture and urban planning&quot; and was a major influence in late-twentieth-century architecture. Graves was among the most prolific and prominent American architects from the mid-1960s to the end of the twentieth century. Graves and his team designed more than 350 buildings in the Postmodern, New Classical, and New Urbanism styles for projects around the world. His architectural designs have been recognized as major influences in all three of these movements.

In naming Graves as a recipient of its national design award for lifetime achievement, the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum explained that Graves broadened &quot;the role of the architect in society&quot; and raised &quot;public interest in good design as essential to the quality of everyday life.&quot; Graves and his firm designed more than 2,000 consumer products during his lifetime. He was especially noted for his domestic housewares. Many Graves-designed products were sold through mass-market U.S. retailers such as Target and J. C. Penney, but his best-known product is the iconic kettle that he designed in 1985 for Alessi, an Italian housewares manufacturer. As an advocate for the needs of the disabled, Graves used his skills as an architect and designer &quot;to improve healthcare experience for patients, families and clinicians.&quot;

<doc id="53409" wikidata="Q559852" url="?curid=53409" title="Walter Burley Griffin">
<text>Walter Burley Griffin (November 24, 1876February 11, 1937) was an American architect and landscape architect. He designed Canberra, Australia&#x27;s capital city, the New South Wales towns of Griffith and Leeton, and (with his wife) the Sydney suburb of Castlecrag.

Influenced by the Chicago-based Prairie School, Griffin developed a unique modern style in partnership with his wife Marion Mahony Griffin. In 28 years they designed over 350 buildings, landscape and urban-design projects as well as designing construction materials, interiors, furniture and other household items.

==Early life==
Griffin was born in 1876 in Maywood, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. He was the eldest of the four children of George Walter Griffin, an insurance agent, and Estelle Burley Griffin. His family moved to Oak Park and later to Elmhurst. As a boy, he had an interest in landscape design and gardening, and his parents allowed him to landscape the yard at their new home in Elmhurst. Griffin attended Oak Park High School. He considered studying landscape design but was advised by the landscape gardener O. C. Simonds to pursue a more lucrative profession.

Griffin chose to study architecture, and, in 1899, completed his bachelor&#x27;s degree in architecture at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The University of Illinois program was run by Nathan Clifford Ricker, a German-educated architect, who emphasized the technical aspects of architecture. During his studies, he also took courses in horticulture and forestry.

==Chicago career==

After his studies, Griffin moved to Chicago and was employed as a draftsman for two years in the offices of progressive architects Dwight H. Perkins, Robert C. Spencer, Jr., and H. Webster Tomlinson in &quot;Steinway Hall&quot;. Griffin&#x27;s employers worked in the distinctive Prairie School style. This style is marked by horizontal lines, flat roofs with broad overhanging eaves, solid construction, craftsmanship, and strict discipline in the use of ornament. Louis Sullivan was influential among Prairie School architects and Griffin was an admirer of his work, and of his philosophy of architecture which stressed that design should be free of historical precedent. Other architects of that school include George Grant Elmslie, George Washington Maher, William Gray Purcell, William Drummond and most importantly, Frank Lloyd Wright.

In July 1901, Griffin passed the new Illinois architects&#x27; licensing examination and this permitted him to enter private practice as an architect. He began working in Frank Lloyd Wright&#x27;s famous Oak Park, Illinois, studios. Although he was never made a partner, Griffin oversaw the construction on many of Wright&#x27;s noted houses including the Willits House in 1902 and the Larkin Administration Building built in 1904. From 1905 he also began to supply landscape plans for Wright&#x27;s buildings. Wright allowed Griffin and his other staff to undertake small commissions of their own. The William Emery house, built in Elmhurst, Illinois, in 1903 was such a commission. While working for Wright, Griffin fell in love with Mr. Wright&#x27;s sister, Maginel Wright. He proposed marriage to her, but his affections for her were not returned, and she refused.

In 1906, he resigned his position at Wright&#x27;s studio and established his own practice at Steinway Hall. Griffin and Wright had fallen out over events following Mr. Wright&#x27;s trip to Japan in 1905. While Wright was away for five months, Griffin ran the practice. When Wright returned, he told Griffin that he had overstepped his responsibilities, completing several of Wright&#x27;s jobs, and sometimes substituting his own building designs. Further, Wright had borrowed money from Griffin to pay for his travels abroad, and then he tried to pay off his debts to Griffin with prints he had acquired in Japan. It became clear to Griffin then that Wright would not make Griffin a partner in his business.
Griffin&#x27;s first independent commission was a landscape design for the State Normal School at Charleston, Illinois, that became Eastern Illinois University. In the fall of 1906, he received his first residential job from Harry Peters. The Peters&#x27; House was the first house designed with an L-shaped or open floor plan. The L-shape was an economical design and easily constructed. From 1907 to 1914, several houses designed by Griffin were built on the far southwest side of Chicago in the city&#x27;s Beverly and Morgan Park, Chicago neighborhoods. In 1981, the city of Chicago granted landmark status to 13 of these Prairie-style bungalows in Beverly along the 1700 block of West 104th Place, 12 blocks of Longwood Drive between West 98th and 110th Streets, and three blocks of Seeley Avenue. With seven of these houses being located on West 104th Place—comprising the largest concentration of original prairie style homes built in Chicago—the street as it runs between Hale Avenue on the west to Prospect Avenue on the east was designated the &quot;Griffin Place Historic District&quot;, which comprises a part of the larger Ridge Historic District.

In 1911, Griffin developed &#x27;Solid Rock&#x27; house for William F. Tempel in Winnetka, Illinois. It was the first house built by Griffin in his mature style and of reinforced concrete.

On June 29, 1911, Griffin married Marion Lucy Mahony, a graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in architecture. She was employed first in Wright&#x27;s office, and then by Hermann V. von Holst, who had taken over Wright&#x27;s work in America when Wright left for Europe in 1909. Marion Mahony recommended to von Holst that he hire Griffin to develop a landscape plan for the area surrounding the three houses on Millikin Place for which Wright had been hired in Decatur, Illinois. Mahony and Griffin worked closely on the Decatur project immediately before their marriage.

After their marriage, Mahony went to work in Griffin&#x27;s practice. A housing development with several homes designed by Griffin and Mahony, Rock Crest – Rock Glen in Mason City, Iowa, is seen as their most dramatic American design development of the decade and remains the largest collection of Prairie Style homes surrounding a natural setting.

From 1899 to 1914, Griffin created more than 130 designs in his Chicago office for buildings, urban plans and landscapes; half of these were built in the mid-western states of Illinois, Iowa, Michigan and Wisconsin.

The relationship between Griffin and Frank Lloyd Wright cooled in the years following Griffin&#x27;s departure from Wright&#x27;s firm in 1906. With Walter and Marion&#x27;s wedding, Wright started to feel they were &quot;against him&quot;. After the Griffins&#x27; win in the Australian federal capital design competition, and resultant front-page coverage in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Wright and Griffin never spoke to each other again. In later years, whenever Griffin was brought up in conversation Wright would downplay his achievements and refer to him as a draftsman.

==Canberra==

In April 1911, the Australian Commonwealth Government held an international competition to produce a design for its new, as yet unnamed, federal capital city. Griffin produced a design with impressive renderings of the plan by his new wife. They first heard about the competition in July, while on honeymoon, and worked feverishly to prepare the plans. On May 23, 1912, Griffin&#x27;s design was selected as the winner from among 137 entries. This created significant press coverage at the time and brought him professional and public recognition. Of his plan, he famously remarked:

I have planned a city that is not like any other in the world. I have planned it not in a way that I expected any government authorities in the world would accept. I have planned an ideal city – a city that meets my ideal of the city of the future. 

In 1913, Griffin was invited by the Commonwealth Government to Australia to inspect the site that was to become Canberra. He left Mahony Griffin in charge of the practice and travelled to Australia in July. His letters reveal his appreciation for the Australian landscape. The Griffins joined the Naturalists Society of New South Wales in 1914, where they enjoyed organized bush walks and field studies. The society facilitated their contact with the Australian scientific community, especially botanists. This appreciation for Australian flora was reflected in Griffin&#x27;s 1914 town plan for the town of Leeton in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area of New South Wales, and later in a design for Newman College at the University of Melbourne. He also used Australian flora botanical names as places names for suburbs and streets in Canberra, such as Grevillea Park, Telopea Park, Clienthus Circle and Blandfordia.

Griffin was offered the position of head of the department of architecture at the University of Illinois. At the same time he was negotiating a three-year contract with the Commonwealth Government to remain in Australia and oversee the implementation of his plan, which he felt had already been compromised. In October 1913, he was appointed the Federal Capital Director of Design and Construction. In this role, Griffin oversaw the design of North and South Canberra, though he struggled with considerable political and bureaucratic obstacles. In May 1914, he and his wife left America for Australia along with architects Roy Lippincott and George Elgh.

With the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Griffin was under pressure to reduce the scope and scale of his plans due to the diversion of funds towards the war effort. Several parts of his basic design underwent change. Plans to create Westbourne, Southbourne and Eastbourne Avenues to complement Canberra&#x27;s Northbourne Avenue were eliminated, as was a proposed railway connecting South Canberra to North Canberra, and on to Yass, 35 mi (55 km) away. A market area that would have been at Russell Hill in North Canberra was moved south to Fyshwick, next to South Canberra.

The pace of building was slower than expected, partly because of a lack of funds and partly because of continued disputation between Griffin and Commonwealth Government bureaucrats. Many of Griffin&#x27;s design ideas were attacked by both the architectural profession and the press. In 1917, a Royal Commission determined that they had undermined Griffin&#x27;s authority by supplying him with false data which he had used to carry out his work. Ultimately, Griffin resigned from the Canberra design project in December 1920 when he discovered that several of these bureaucrats had been appointed to an agency that would oversee Canberra&#x27;s construction. The Commonwealth Government under the leadership of Prime Minister Hughes had removed Griffin as Director of Design and Construction after disagreements over his supervisory role, and in 1921 it created the Federal Capital Advisory Committee, with John Sulman as chair. Griffin was offered membership, but declined and withdrew from further activity in Canberra.

Griffin designed several buildings for Canberra, none of which was built. The grave of General Bridges on Mount Pleasant was the only permanent structure designed by him to be built in Canberra.

Aside from the city&#x27;s design, Griffin&#x27;s longest-living legacy is the plantation of Redwood trees (&quot;Sequoia sempervirens&quot; and &quot;Sequoiadendron giganteum&quot;) known as Pialligo Redwood Forest, that he and arborist Thomas Charles Weston planted in 1918. It is on Pialligo Avenue between Canberra and Queanbeyan, 1.8 mi (2.8 km) east of Canberra airport.

==Later career==

The Griffins&#x27; office in Chicago closed in 1917; however, they had successful practices in Melbourne and Sydney, which were a strong motivation for their continuing to live in Australia. The Griffins had received commissions for work outside Canberra since Walter first arrived in the country in 1913, designing town plans, subdivisions, and one of his highly regarded buildings, Newman College, the Catholic residential college of the University of Melbourne while employed in Canberra. While supervising activities in Canberra, Griffin spent much time in Melbourne and, in 1918, became a founder, with Royden Powell, of the Henry George Club, an organization devoted to providing a home for the Single Tax movement. The Griffins&#x27; first major commission after leaving Canberra was the Capitol Theatre in Melbourne; it opened on November 7, 1924. In 1964 architectural writer Robin Boyd described the Capitol as &quot;the best cinema that was ever built or is ever likely to be built&quot;.

In 1916 and 1917, Griffin developed a patented modular concrete construction system known as &quot;Knitlock&quot; for use in the construction of Canberra. No Knitlock buildings were ever built in Canberra, although several were built in Australia. The first were built on Griffin&#x27;s property in Frankston in 1922, where he constructed two holiday houses called &quot;Gumnuts&quot;. The best examples of Knitlock include the S.R. Salter House in Toorak and the Paling House. Frank Lloyd Wright designed a similar system and used Griffin&#x27;s design to support the arguments for his design.

In 1919, the Griffins founded the Greater Sydney Development Association (GSDA), and in 1921 purchased 259 ha of land in North Sydney. The GSDA&#x27;s goal was the development of an idyllic community with a consistent architectural feel and bushland setting. Walter Burley Griffin as managing director of the GSDA designed all the buildings built in the area until 1935. Castlecrag was the first suburb to be developed by the GSDA. The Redding House and several others in Castelcrag were also built in Knitlock. Almost all the houses Griffin designed in Castlecrag were small and had flat roofs, and he included an internal courtyard in many of them. Griffin used what was at that time the novel concept of including native bushland in these designs. He came to be referred to as &quot;The Wizard of Castlecrag&quot;.

Other work the Griffins did during this time included the Melbourne subdivisions of Glenard (where the Griffins built their own Knitlock house &quot;Pholiota&quot;) and Mount Eagle at Eaglemont, and the Ranelagh Estate in Mount Eliza Victoria 1924. The Ranelagh Estate was listed on the Victorian State Heritage Register (H01605) in 2005 as a significant example of a country estate. Prior to 1920 the Griffins also designed the New South Wales towns of Leeton and Griffith. Griffin and architect J Burcham Clamp designed a large tomb built at Waverley Cemetery, Sydney, between 1914 and 1916 for James Stuart, which still stands as a good example of Griffin&#x27;s sense of &#x27;human-scale monumentality&#x27;.

The Griffins participated in the celebrated Chicago Tribune Tower Competition in 1922. Having won one international competition, as architects who were both well acquainted with Chicago and recognized as practical visionaries, they offered a solution that was positive, forward-looking and elegant. Indeed, their non-winning entry appears to have been about a decade ahead of its time, with emphatic verticality along the lines of the Art Deco or Art Moderne. It anticipated, and would have been a near neighbor of, Chicago&#x27;s 333 North Michigan by Holabird &amp; Roche (1928); with stylistic echos in John and Donald Parkinson&#x27;s Bullocks Wilshire, in Los Angeles (1929), as well as Adah Robinson and Bruce Goff&#x27;s Boston Avenue Methodist Church, Tulsa (1929).

In the 1920s, the Griffins prepared plans for the Milleara Estate (also known as City View) at Avondale Heights and the Ranelagh Estate at Mount Eliza, both in Victoria (Australia) in conjunction with surveyors Tuxen and Miller.

===Incinerators===
During the financial hardship of the Great Depression, in the 1930s Griffin designed incinerators, collaborating with the Reverberatory Incinerator and Engineering Company (RIECo), in conjunction with his friend and business partner, Eric Nicholls. He was responsible for twelve incinerator designs between 1930 and 1938, of which seven still survive. They are located at:

* Willoughby, New South Wales
* Glebe, New South Wales
* Ipswich, Queensland
* Essendon, Victoria
* Hindmarsh, South Australia
* Thebarton, South Australia
* Canberra, Australian Capital Territory
The Willoughby incinerator is a good example of this work. It has been listed by the National Trust of Australia and the Royal Australian Institute of Architects as a building of significance. In 1999 it was listed in the New South Wales State Heritage Register. It has since been restored and converted to commercial use by Willoughby Council.

The Walter Burley Griffin Incinerator, Ipswich, Queensland is listed on the Queensland Heritage Register and has been converted into a theatre. Another incinerator was built in the suburb of Pyrmont, not far from the centre of Sydney. This incinerator was considered for heritage listing but was demolished in 1992 because it was in irredeemably bad condition. 

==India==
During their time at the GSDA, the Griffins became more involved in anthroposophy, and in 1935 through contacts in the movement Griffin won a commission to design the library at the University of Lucknow in Lucknow, India.

Although he had planned to stay in India only to complete the drawings for the library, he soon received more than 40 commissions, including the University of Lucknow Student Union building; a museum and library for the Raja of Mahmudabad; a zenana (women&#x27;s quarters) for the Raja of Jahangirabad; Pioneer Press building, a bank, municipal offices, many private houses, and a memorial to King George V. He also won complete design responsibility for the 1936–1937 United Provinces Exhibition of Industry and Agriculture. His 53 projects for the site featured a stadium, arena, mosque, imambara, art gallery, restaurant, bazaar, pavilions, rotundas, arcades, and towers, however, only part of his elaborate plans were fully executed.

Griffin was inspired by the architecture and culture of India, modifying forms as &quot;he sought to create a modern Indian architecture ... Griffin was able to expand his aesthetic vocabulary to create an exuberant, expressive architecture reflecting both the &#x27;stamp of the place&#x27; and the &#x27;spirit of the times&#x27;&quot;. While in India, Griffin also published numerous articles for the &quot;Pioneer&quot;, writing about architecture, in particular about ventilation design improvements. Marion joined Walter in Lucknow in April 1936 to collaborate on several projects.

===Death and burial in India===
Griffin died of peritonitis in early 1937, five days after gall bladder surgery at King George&#x27;s Hospital, Lucknow, in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India, and was buried in Christian Cemetery in Lucknow. Marion Mahony Griffin oversaw the completion of the Pioneer Building that he had been working on at the time of his death. She closed down their Indian offices before leaving their Australian practice in the hands of Griffin&#x27;s partner, Eric Milton Nicholls, and returned to Chicago.

==Legacy==

Griffin was largely under-appreciated during his time in Australia, but, since his death, recognition of his work has steadily grown. In 1964, when Canberra&#x27;s central lake was filled, as Griffin had intended, Prime Minister Robert Menzies declined to have the lake named after himself. Instead he named it Lake Burley Griffin, making it the first &quot;monument&quot; in Canberra dedicated to the city&#x27;s designer (&quot;Burley&quot; was included in the name because of the ongoing misconception that it was part of Griffin&#x27;s surname). Burley Griffin Way is a 276 km road linking Griffith, Temora, Harden, and Binalong to the Hume highway west of Bowning, 10 km northwest of Yass.

Architectural drawings and other archival materials by and about the Griffins are held by numerous institutions in the United States, including the Drawings and Archives Department of Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library at Columbia University; the Block Gallery at Northwestern University; the Ryerson &amp; Burnham Libraries at the Art Institute of Chicago; and the New York Historical Society, as well as in several repositories in Australia, including the National Library of Australia, National Archives of Australia, and the Newman College Archives of the University of Melbourne. At the centenary of the Griffins&#x27; design work for Canberra, some believe they are owed a permanent memorial.

== In his own words ==
&quot;I am what may be termed a naturalist in architecture. I do not believe in any school of architecture. I believe in architecture that is the logical outgrowth of the environment in which the building in mind is to be located&quot;.
From &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Sunday June 2, 1912

<doc id="53410" wikidata="Q379773" url="?curid=53410" title="Jean-Eugène Robert-Houdin">
<text>Jean-Eugène Robert-Houdin (; 7 December 1805 – 13 June 1871) was a French watchmaker, magician and illusionist, widely recognized as the father of the modern style of conjuring. He transformed magic from a pastime for the lower classes, seen at fairs, to an entertainment for the wealthy, which he offered in a theatre opened in Paris, a legacy preserved by the tradition of modern magicians performing in tails.

==Early life and entrance into conjuring==
Robert-Houdin was born Jean-Eugène Robert in Blois, France, on 7 December 1805—a day after his autobiography said he was. His father, Prosper Robert, was a watchmaker in Blois. Jean-Eugene&#x27;s mother, the former Marie-Catherine Guillon, died when he was just a young child. At the age of eleven, Prosper sent his son Jean-Eugène to school thirty-five miles up the Loire to the University of Orléans. At 18, he graduated and returned to Blois. His father wanted him to be a lawyer, but Robert-Houdin wanted to follow in his father&#x27;s footsteps as a watchmaker.

===Apprentice clockmaker===
His penmanship was excellent, and it landed him a job as a clerk for an attorney&#x27;s office. Instead of studying law, he tinkered with mechanical gadgets. His employer sent him back to his father. He was told that he was better suited as a watchmaker than a lawyer, but by then, Jean&#x27;s father had already retired, so he became an apprentice to his cousin who had a watch-shop. For a short time, Jean-Eugène worked as a watchmaker.

In the mid-1820s, he saved up to buy a copy of a two-volume set of books on clockmaking called &quot;Traité de l&#x27;horlogerie&quot; (&quot;Treatise on Clockmaking&quot;), written by Ferdinand Berthoud. He would go on to pursue the craft of clockmaking for the rest of his life, and is widely credited with inventing the mystery clock.

===Introduction to magic===
When he got home and opened the wrapping, instead of the Berthoud books, what appeared before his eyes was a two-volume set on magic called &quot;Scientific Amusements&quot;. Instead of returning the books, his curiosity got the better of him. From those crude volumes, he learned the rudiments of magic. He practiced at all hours of the day.

From that point on, he became very interested in the art. He was upset that the books he got only revealed how the secrets were done but did not show how to do them. He found that learning from the books available in those days was very difficult due to the lack of detailed explanations, but the books piqued his interest in the art. So Robert-Houdin began taking lessons from a local amateur magician. He paid ten francs for a series of lessons from a man named Maous from Blois who was a podiatrist but also entertained at fairs and parties doing magic. He was proficient at sleight of hand, and taught Robert-Houdin how to juggle to improve his hand-eye coordination. He also taught him rudiments of the cups and balls. He told young Robert-Houdin that digital dexterity came with repetition, and as a direct result, Robert-Houdin practiced incessantly.

Magic was his pastime, and meanwhile, his studies in horology continued. When he felt he was ready, he moved to Tours and set up a watchmaking business, doing conjuring on the side.

Much of what we know about Robert-Houdin comes from his memoirs—and his writings were meant more to entertain than to chronicle, rendering it difficult to separate fact from fiction. Robert-Houdin would have readers believe that a major turning point in his life came when he became apprenticed to the magician Edmund De Grisi, Count&#x27;s son and better known as Torrini. What is known is that his early performing came from joining an amateur acting troupe.

===Marriage to Josèphe Cecile Houdin===
He performed at social parties as a professional magician in Europe and the United States. It was during this period while at a party that he met Josèphe Cecile Houdin, the daughter of a Parisian watchmaker, Jacques-François Houdin, who also originally came from Blois. Jean-Eugène fell in love with her at their first meeting. On 8 July 1830, they were married; he then hyphenated his own name to hers and became Robert-Houdin. He and Josèphe had eight children, of whom three survived.

He moved to Paris and worked in his father-in-law&#x27;s wholesale shop. Jacques-François was among the last of the watchmakers to use the old method of handcrafting each piece and embraced his new son-in-law&#x27;s ambitions for mechanism. While Houdin worked in the main shop, Jean-Eugène was to tinker with mechanical toys and automatic figures. With his work in the shop, Jean-Eugène was still practicing magic. Quite by accident, Robert-Houdin walked into a shop on the Rue Richelieu and discovered that it sold magic. He visited the store, which was owned by a Père (Papa) Roujol. There, he met fellow magicians, both amateur and professional, where he engaged in talk about conjuring, and he met an aristocrat by the name of Jules de Rovère, who coined the term &quot;prestidigitation&quot; to describe a major misdirection technique magicians used.

At Papa Roujol&#x27;s, Robert-Houdin learned the details to many of the mechanical tricks of the time as well as how to improve them. From there, he built his own mechanical figures, like a singing bird, a dancer on a tightrope, and an automaton doing the cups and balls. His most acclaimed automaton was his writing and drawing figure. He displayed this figure before King Louis Philippe and eventually sold it to P. T. Barnum.

On 19 October 1843, Josèphe died at the age of thirty-two, having been ill for months. At her death, having three young children to take care of, he remarried in August to Françoise Marguerite Olympe Braconnier, a woman ten years younger, who soon took over the household.

Robert-Houdin loved to watch the big magic shows that came to Paris. He dreamed about some day opening his own theatre. In the meantime, he was hired by a friend by the name of Count de l&#x27;Escalopier to perform at private parties.

Now that he had free time, he began constructing equipment for his own use instead of selling it to others. The income from the shop and his new inventions gave him enough money to experiment on new tricks using glass apparatus that would be (or at least appear to be) free of trickery. He envisioned a stage that would be as elegant as the drawing rooms in which he was hired to perform. He also decided that a magician should be dressed as such by wearing traditional evening clothes.

===Opening the &quot;Palais Royale&quot;===
He obtained financial backing from Count de l&#x27;Escalopier, who fronted him the 15,000 francs to turn his vision into reality. He rented out a suite of rooms above the archways around the gardens of the Palais Royal, which was once owned by Cardinal Richelieu. He hired workmen to redesign the old assembly room into a theatre. They painted it white with gold trim. Tasteful drapes were hung, chic candelabras were placed throughout, and the stage furniture was set in the style of Louis XV.

On 3 July 1845, Robert-Houdin premiered his 200-seat Théâtre Robert-Houdin in what he called &quot;Soirées fantastiques&quot;. No critics covered Robert-Houdin&#x27;s debut, and in his memoirs, Robert-Houdin said that the show had been a disaster. He suffered from stage fright that caused him to talk too fast and in a monotone. He said that he did not know what he was saying or doing, and everything was a blur. He believed that a magician should not present a trick until it was mechanically perfected to be certain of avoiding failure, and this caused him to over-rehearse.

After the first show, he was close to having a nervous breakdown. He closed the theatre and had every intention to close it for good, until a friend agreed that the venture was a silly idea. Instead of admitting defeat, Robert-Houdin, irked at the friend&#x27;s effrontery, used this insult to regain his courage, and persevered in giving the show a long run at his little theatre. Although the forty-year-old magician was unpolished at first, he soon gained the confidence required for the stage.

With each performance, Robert-Houdin got better, and he began to receive critical acclaim. &quot;Le Charivari&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;Illustration&quot; both said that his mechanical marvels and artistic magic were comparable to those of his predecessors like Philippe and Bartolomeo Bosco. Even with all of this, still relatively few people would come to the little theatre during the summer months, and he struggled to keep it open. To meet expenses, he sold the three houses that he had inherited from his mother.

The following year, he added a new trick to his programme that became especially popular. Seats at the Palais Royal were at a premium. This new marvel was called &quot;Second Sight&quot;. &quot;Second Sight&quot; drew the audiences into the little theatre. Once there, they saw the other creations Robert-Houdin had to offer. He also performed outside Paris, sometimes with local magicians, as he did in Liège in 1846 with the then well-known Belgian magician Louis Courtois.

==Famous illusions==
Robert-Houdin combined his mechanical abilities along with &quot;showmanship, humour, and artistic handling&quot; to produce his illusions. Robert-Houdin felt that every magic programme should be arranged so one trick builds upon the others. One surprise should lead to an even bigger surprise. Some of the tricks and illusions Robert-Houdin presented became classics. Here are a few of them.

===Second sight===
When Robert-Houdin first opened his theatre, it was sparsely attended and he realized that he needed something more extraordinary that would bring the public to his theatre. So he came upon the idea of doing a two-person mind-reading act, concocting a silly story about how his son Émile had created a game of hot and cold that resulted in Robert-Houdin using it for the stage.

He named the trick &quot;Second Sight&quot;, a title that was already used by magicians such as John Henry Anderson, but the effect was entirely different. Anderson had a box into which items were inserted. The medium would then describe the contents inside. In Robert-Houdin&#x27;s version, he walked into the audience and touched items that the audience held up, and his blindfolded assistant, played by his son, described each one in detail. It caused a sensation and brought the throng to see his shows.

Eventually, Robert-Houdin changed the method, so instead of asking his son what was in his hands, he simply rang a bell. This stunned those that suspected a spoken code. He would even set the bell off to the side and remain silent, and his son still described every object handed to his father.

Robert-Houdin made the test even more difficult. He placed a glass of water into his son&#x27;s hands, and Émile proceeded to drink from it. He was able to perceive the taste of the liquids that spectators from the audience merely thought of. Even then, the audiences were not entirely convinced; they tried to trip up Émile by bringing in books written in Greek, or odd tools such as a thread counter.

===The ethereal suspension===
During Robert-Houdin&#x27;s time, all of Paris was enthusiastically talking about the mysterious uses of &quot;ether&quot;. He took advantage of this by presenting an illusion that appeared to use the pungent liquid. He told the audience that he had discovered a marvelous new property of ether. &quot;If one has a living person inhale this liquid when it is at its highest degree of concentration, the body of the patient for a few moments becomes as light as a balloon,&quot; Robert-Houdin claimed.

He proceeded to &quot;prove&quot; just that. He placed three stools on a wooden bench. His youngest son Eugène stood on the middle one. With the instructions from his father, he extended his arms. Robert-Houdin placed two canes on top of the stools and positioned them under his son&#x27;s arms.

He took a vial of ether and opened it. The audience smelled it wafting through the theatre. He placed the vial under his son&#x27;s nose, and he went limp. In reality, the vial was empty, with the odour being produced by his son Émile pouring real ether on a hot iron shovel.

Robert-Houdin took the stool away from his son&#x27;s feet, and he just hung limp as a rag. He took away one of the canes, so he was dangling by one arm, and carefully placed his head against his upraised hand. This was startling enough. What he did next was stunning. He lifted his boy upright in a horizontal position by his little finger and then let go until he was suspended in mid air. Robert-Houdin stepped away to leave his son in that suspended state, balanced only by his right elbow and no other support.

When it was apparent that the drug was wearing off, Robert-Houdin returned his son to his upright position. When he woke up, he seemed no worse for wear. Robert-Houdin built up the surprise of spectators until, &quot;… by gradually heightening it up to the moment when, so to speak, it exploded.&quot; This brought letters of protest against Robert-Houdin, thinking he was putting his son&#x27;s health in jeopardy, although the ether had nothing to do with the trick.

Robert-Houdin was not the first to perform the Levitation Illusion. The first in Europe was Ching Lau Lauro in the 1830s. The illusion was also reported to be performed by an Indian conjuror before that, but sitting cross-legged rather than lying down.

===The Marvelous Orange Tree===
This trick was likely inspired by the Indian mango tree trick, where a performer would grow a tree from a seed to a sprout, then into a tree with fruit. On one of Robert-Houdin&#x27;s side tables, he had an egg, a lemon, and an orange. He went into the audience and borrowed a lady&#x27;s handkerchief that was in style then. He rolled it into a ball. He rubbed the ball in between his hands, and the handkerchief got smaller and smaller until it disappeared, passing through to the egg on the table.

Carefully, he picked up the egg. The audience expected him to crack it open and produce the spectator&#x27;s handkerchief. Instead, he made that disappear too. He told the audience that the egg went to the lemon. This was repeated with the lemon and the orange. When he made the orange disappear, all that was left was a fine powder. This was placed into a silver vial. He soaked this vial with alcohol and set it on fire.

A small orange tree planted in a wooden box was brought forth by one of his assistants. The audience noticed that the tree was barren of any blossoms or fruit. The blue flame from the vial was placed underneath it. The vapors from it caused the leaves to spread and sprout orange blossoms from it. Robert-Houdin then picked up his magic wand and waved it. The flowers disappeared and oranges bloomed forth.

He plucked the oranges from the tree and tossed them to the audience to prove they were real. He did this until he only had one left. He waved his wand again, and the orange split open into four sections, revealing a white material of sorts inside of it. Two clockwork butterflies appeared from behind the tree. The butterflies grabbed the end of the corner of the white cloth and spread it open, revealing the spectator&#x27;s handkerchief.

The Marvelous Orange Tree trick was used by the eponymous conjurer in Steven Millhauser&#x27;s short story &quot;Eisenheim the Illusionist&quot; and its film adaptation &quot;The Illusionist&quot; (2006), where a more complex variant is shown. It is also alluded to in Donald Barthelme&#x27;s short story &quot;Sentence&quot;.

===Robert-Houdin&#x27;s portfolio===
Robert-Houdin brought in under his arm a large portfolio used for holding documents or art work. The portfolio was only about one and three-quarters of an inch thick, too small or too thin to hold anything but pictures.

He set it on two thin trestles to hold the case with the spine facing the audience. He removed the expected drawings from it. One of those pictures showed a bareheaded woman. Then, he produced two lady&#x27;s bonnets decorated with flowers; one for winter, the other for summer. He lowered the flap for each production. Then, he showed a picture of birds, followed by a stuffed bird flat as a pancake. With that, he proceeded to produce from the portfolio four live turtle doves.

He showed a picture of a cartoon of two cooks fighting with pots. This was followed by three enormous copper pots. One was filled with beans, another with flames bursting forth, and the third pot was filled with boiling water. As an afterthought, he lifted the top flap of the portfolio and pulled out a large cage filled with birds.

He walked forward towards the audience with the square cage, and they applauded thinking the trick was over. &quot;Nothing here now—neither anything, nor anybody,&quot; he said as he knocked on the upright flap. For a finale, he closed the portfolio one last time and produced his young son from it.

===The light and heavy chest===
The number of tricks he invented for his theatre was extensive, but his most remarkable one was the &quot;Light and Heavy Chest&quot;. He took advantage of the infancy of the usage of electricity, especially the then-novelty of Hans Christian Ørsted&#x27;s discovery of electromagnetism, to his advantage. Robert-Houdin brought on a small wooden box about a foot wide. He said that he had found a way to protect it from thieves. He asked a spectator to lift it, usually a small child. The child lifted it with ease. Then, he brought an adult male up from the audience and asked him to lift the same box. The adult male was unable to lift the box.

==Inventions pirated==
Robert-Houdin&#x27;s inventions were pirated by his trusted mechanic Le Grand, who was arrested for making and selling duplicate illusions. Many of those illusions fell into the hands of his competitors, such as John Henry Anderson, Robin, Robert Heller, and Compars Herrmann. It is not known whether Herrmann or the others bought the illusions directly from LeGrand or from another source, but they willingly performed the illusions after knowing that they were invented by Robert-Houdin.

==Robert-Houdin on tour==
Robert-Houdin&#x27;s little theatre became a mecca for magic enthusiasts. Herrmann was a constant visitor to the Palais Royal. It became the place for the Paris elite to go. Even King Louis Philippe rented out the room for a private performance. After the triumph he gave at the Royal Palace, in 1847, the king decided to take his entourage to see Robert-Houdin at the Palais Royal.

The following February, a revolution ended the reign of Louis-Philippe. With it, show business also ended. The Revolution closed all Parisian theatres. Robert-Houdin shut down his theatre and went on the road. He toured the Continent briefly, and then he headed off to Great Britain.

With a company of French dramatists, Robert-Houdin made his English debut at the St. James Theatre in London. He presented his programme three times a week. Much to his dismay, he found out that Compars Herrmann had beaten him to the territory. Not only was he billing himself as &quot;the Premier Prestidigitateur of France&quot;, but he was also using pirated versions of his illusions. Despite this, Robert-Houdin still accomplished a success there. So much so, in 1848, he did a command performance for Queen Victoria. After a three-month tour of England, he went back home after about a year and a half away. He reopened the theatre and became a permanent fixture in Paris. In 1850, he handed the Palais Royal to his brother-in-law Hamilton (Pierre Etienne Chocat). This left him free to tour France. He did so for two years. Then he went to Germany and on a return engagement to England, where he ended up performing a second time for Queen Victoria.

He did a brief tour of France and then, at the age of 48, retired from public performances. He gave the theatre back to Hamilton, who continued to fill the little theatre. After Robert-Houdin retired, he devoted himself to his inventions with electricity and his writings. His home, &quot;Le Prieuré&quot; (the Priory), was a marvel in advancement.

==Magic mission to Algeria==
In 1856, he was asked by Louis-Napoleon to pacify the tribes in French Algeria. During this period, the French Army commanders maintained order in the newly pacified region. They supervised local Muslim administrations and the &quot;bureaux arabes&quot;. These areas were closed off to colonization by the Europeans. Napoleon III was worried about religious leaders called Marabouts. The Marabouts were able to control their tribe with their faux magical abilities. They advised their leaders to break ranks with the French. Napoleon wanted Robert-Houdin to show that French magic was stronger.

The magical mission began with an informal show at the Bab Azoun Theatre in Algeria, where he would give performances twice weekly. He also gave many special galas before the country&#x27;s tribal chiefs. He used &quot;The Light and Heavy Chest&quot; during these performances, but instead of playing it for comedy as he had in Paris, here he played it straight. Robert-Houdin once invited the strongest tribesman on stage and asked the Arabian to pick up the wooden chest placed on stage. The Arabian picked it up with no problem. Then Robert-Houdin announced that he was going to sap his strength. He waved his wand and declared: &quot;Contemplez ! Maintenant vous êtes plus faible qu&#x27;une femme ; essayez de soulever la boîte.&quot; (&quot;Behold! Now you are weaker than a woman; try to lift the box.&quot;) The Arabian pulled on the handle of the chest, but it would not budge. He tried and tried until he tried to rip it apart. Instead, he screamed in pain, as Robert-Houdin had rigged the box to give the Arabian an electrical shock if he tried to rip the handles off. The Arabian let go of the handle, ran off into the aisle, and ran screaming out of the theatre.

After his performances were done, he gave a special presentation for several chief men of their tribe. He was invited to the home of the head of the tribe of the desert interior, Bou-Allem. In dawn of the Arab desert, Robert-Houdin was challenged to do a special trick. He obliged by inviting one of the rebels to shoot at him with a marked bullet, which he caught between his teeth. He was given a certificate from Bou-Allem, who wore a red robe symbolizing his loyalty to France. With this scroll praising his mysterious manifestations, Robert-Houdin went back to France with the mission accomplished.

&quot;The blow was struck&quot;, Robert-Houdin said, &quot;...henceforth the interpreters and all those who had dealings with the Arabs received orders to make them understand that my pretended miracles were only the result of skill, inspired and guided by an art called prestidigitation, in no way connected with sorcery&quot;. He went on to say, &quot;The Arabs doubtless yielded to these arguments, for henceforth I was on the most friendly terms with them.&quot; He was rewarded for his services by the French government for suppressing any possible rebellion.

==Retirement and death==
After his mission in Algeria was completed, Robert-Houdin gave his last public performance at the Grand Théâtre in Marseille, then returned to his home in Saint-Gervais, near his native Blois, where he wrote his memoirs, &quot;Confidences d&#x27;un Prestidigitateur&quot;. He also wrote several books on the art of magic. He lived happily in retirement for about fifteen years, until the advent of the Franco Prussian War. His son Eugène was a captain in a Zouave regiment. On 6 August 1870, Robert-Houdin heard news of his son being mortally wounded at the Battle of Wörth. Meanwhile, Hessian Soldiers captured Paris, and Robert-Houdin hid his family in a cave near his property. The Russian soldiers were very rude, according to Robert-Houdin, but he found the Polish soldiers to be a lot kinder.

Four days later, Robert-Houdin was to find out that his son had died of his wounds. With the stress from that and the war, his health deteriorated, and he contracted pneumonia. On 13 June 1871, he died of his illness at the age of 65.

==Legacy==
His home in Blois is open to the public as the publicly owned La Maison de la Magie Robert-Houdin. It is a museum and theatre first opened by his grandson Paul Robert-Houdin in April 1966. As a museum of France and bearing the official label of &quot;Musée de France&quot;, it is the only public museum in Europe that incorporates in one place collections of magic and a site for permanent performing arts. The creation of such a site is directly linked to the personality of Robert-Houdin. Several of Robert-Houdin&#x27;s apparatuses, including automata and mystery clocks, reside in David Copperfield&#x27;s private museum.

In December 1852, the Theatre Robert-Houdin moved from its original location to the Boulevard des Italiens in Paris. Ownership passed from Hamilton to Cleverman (François Lahire), then to Robert-Houdin&#x27;s son Émile. Emile was too busy to perform at the theatre, so he arranged for Pierre Edouard Brunnet to present the show.

After his death, Émile&#x27;s widow sold the theatre to Georges Méliès in 1888. Méliès, himself a magician but best known to history as one of the greatest early innovators of film making, later presented his first movies there. He accidentally discovered stop-action special effects and presented his creation at the Theatre Robert-Houdin. One of his classics is &quot;A Trip to the Moon&quot;. In 1924, the building was demolished.

Robert-Houdin&#x27;s autobiography is &quot;The Memoirs of Robert-Houdin&quot;. His life and works are also cited in Robertson Davies&#x27;s &quot;Deptford Trilogy&quot;, notably in the trilogy&#x27;s third novel, &quot;World of Wonders&quot;, which takes place on the set of a movie about Robert-Houdin.

In his book &quot;Hiding the Elephant&quot;, Jim Steinmeyer said that every magician of the 20th century was &quot;haunted&quot; by Robert-Houdin, &quot;... who cast an enormous shadow over their generation&quot;. Hungarian-American magician and escape artist Harry Houdini (born Ehrich Weiss) was so impressed by Robert-Houdin that, after reading his autobiography in 1890, Weiss adopted the stage name of &quot;Houdini&quot; in honour of Robert-Houdin. He incorrectly believed that an &quot;i&quot; on the end of a name meant &quot;like&quot; in French; but Houdini, his own career and reputation established by that time, later lost his youthful respect for Robert-Houdin, believing that he took undue credit for other magicians&#x27; innovations, and wrote &quot;The Unmasking of Robert-Houdin&quot; in 1908.

Robert-Houdin is often credited as being &quot;the father of modern magic&quot;. Before him, magicians performed in marketplaces and fairs, for the lower classes, but Robert-Houdin performed magic in theatres and private parties for wealthier patrons. He also chose to wear formal clothes, like those of his more upscale audiences, which has become a tradition for many modern magicians who wear tail-coats.

Many cities have streets that bear his name: Blois, Bourges, Caen, Paris (11th), Saint-Étienne, and Saint-Gervais-la-Forêt in France; Monticiano in Siena, Italy; and others.

<doc id="53412" wikidata="Q1055303" url="?curid=53412" title="Stage name">
<text>A stage name or professional name is a pseudonym used by performers, authors, and entertainers—such as actors, comedians, singers, and musicians. The equivalent concept among writers is called a &quot;nom de plume&quot; (pen name). Some performers eventually choose to adopt their stage name as a legal name.

Such professional aliases are adopted for a wide variety of reasons and may be similar or nearly identical to an individual&#x27;s birth name or be inspired by nicknames or maiden names. Some people take a stage name because their birth name is difficult to pronounce or spell; is considered unattractive, dull, or unintentionally amusing; or projects an undesired image. Sometimes a performer adopts a name that is unusual or outlandish to attract attention. Some individuals use a stage name because their birth name is already being used by another notable individual, including names that are not exactly the same but still too similar; many guilds and associations that represent actors mandate that no two members may have identical working names. Other performers use a stage name in order to retain anonymity, as is often the case for porn stars, especially if they intend on switching careers. The phrase &quot;nom de porn&quot; is sometimes used to refer to a pornographic actor&#x27;s stage name, referring to the English use of the French-language phrase for pen name.

== Family connection ==
Some individuals who are related to a celebrity take a different last name, so they are not perceived to have received undue advantage from their family connection. Actor Nicolas Cage, born Nicolas Coppola, chose a new last name to avoid comparisons with his uncle, director Francis Ford Coppola, who gave him his big break in the 1982 film &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot;.

Conversely, individuals who wish to receive benefits from their family connections may take that person&#x27;s first or last name. Lon Chaney Sr.&#x27;s son Creighton spent a number of years appearing in minor roles before renaming himself Lon Chaney Jr. Likewise, Emilio Estevez and his sister Renee chose not to take their father Martin Sheen&#x27;s professional name and use their birth names. Their brother Carlos chose to use their father&#x27;s professional name and took the name Charlie Sheen. Some children born outside marriage to a (usually male) celebrity parent have done the same: Jett Williams (née Antha Bell Jett) and Scott Eastwood (né Scott Clinton Reeves) each use their fathers&#x27; last names; while others have not: Joseph Baena, son of Arnold Schwarzenegger, chose not to use his father&#x27;s last name.

Women who achieve fame after marriage often use their married name as part of their professional name, while women who achieved fame before marriage may continue to use their maiden name or a hyphenated surname.

In some cases, the individual may adopt a stage name to avoid confusion with other family members who have similar names. Actor Mark Harmon (Thomas Mark Harmon) uses his middle name professionally to avoid confusion with his father Heisman Trophy winner and former broadcaster Tom Harmon (Thomas Dudley Harmon).

Stephen Nice, the birth name of the lead singer of Steve Harley and Cockney Rebel, took on the stage name &quot;Steve Harley&quot; after realising that his on stage persona differed greatly from his real-life persona, and as a result feeling that he was no longer &quot;Ronald and Joyce&#x27;s (Harley&#x27;s parents) little boy&quot; when on stage.

Comedian Amos Muzyad Yaqoob Kairouz adopted the stage name Danny Thomas, largely because he did not want his friends and family to know he had gone back into working clubs where the salary was better.

==Union rules==
Guilds and associations that represent actors, such as the SAG-AFTRA (formed from a 2012 merger between the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists) in the United States and Equity in the United Kingdom, stipulate that no two members may have identical working names. An actor whose name has already been taken must choose a new name. SAG-AFTRA allows any new member to keep their legal name as their stage name, even if another member has the same stage name already, as long as they sign a waiver.

Notable examples include: Nathan Lane, whose birth name (Joseph Lane) was already in use; Stewart Granger, born James Stewart; and Michael Keaton, born Michael Douglas. Diane Keaton, whose birth name is Diane Hall, took her mother&#x27;s maiden name as a stage name after learning that there was already a registered actress named Diane Hall in the Actors&#x27; Equity Association. &quot;Ugly Betty&quot; actress Vanessa Williams officially uses &quot;Vanessa L. Williams&quot; because of SAG guidelines, although the other actress with same first and last name (Vanessa E. Williams) is arguably less notable. Similarly, David Walliams changed one letter in his surname owing to there being another &quot;David Williams&quot;. Terry O&#x27;Quinn of &quot;Lost&quot; fame changed his surname from Quinn to O&#x27;Quinn as another registered actor already had the name Terrance Quinn. Long-time &quot;Simpsons&quot; writer and &quot;Futurama&quot; executive producer David X. Cohen changed his middle initial from S to X because there was already a David S. Cohen registered with the Writers Guild of America. Julianne Moore was born Julie Anne Smith but found that all variations of that name were already used by other actors. Former American football player Thomas Q. Jones added his middle initial to his name when he began acting, as his name was already taken.

The rumor that Michael Keaton changed his surname because of an attraction to actress Diane Keaton is incorrect; he chose Keaton because of an affinity for the physical comedy of Buster Keaton.

A middle name may be adopted in preference to changing a name. American author James Finn Garner, born James Edward Garner, adopted his mother&#x27;s maiden name for a middle name after joining the SAG, to avoid confusion with James Garner, and retained the name for his writing career. In some cases, attaching a generational suffix is sufficient for guild rules; broadcaster David Lawrence is credited as David H. Lawrence XVII as a result of there being sixteen other David Lawrences in show business at the time he received his SAG card.

A person hoping to become successful as an entertainer who has a name identical to a name already familiar to the public (in any field of endeavor) may change their name in order to avoid having their name evoke the other person with the same name. Singer Katy Perry, born Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson, released her self-titled album under the name Katy Hudson, but later used her mother&#x27;s maiden name to avoid confusion with actress Kate Hudson.

== Involuntary name changes ==
A performer may also have had their stage name chosen for them by their agent – such was the case with Barbara Eden, born Barbara Jean Huffman – or, in the heyday of the Hollywood studios, by a movie studio. Joan Rivers (born Joan Alexandra Molinsky) went one step further and named herself after a former agent, Tony Rivers, after he told her to change her name. In the non-English-speaking world, an example is the Taiwanese Mandopop girl group S.H.E (composed of Selina Jen, Hebe Tian, and Ella Chen), whose members&#x27; English names were chosen by their manager after taking personality tests.

Rockabilly musician Glen Glenn (real name Orin Glen Troutman) had an involuntary name change bestowed upon him in 1956; while he originally performed as Glen Trout, he became Glen Glenn.

Former child star Patty Duke (whose real name is Anna Marie Duke) had her stage name chosen for her by her first managers. Their choice of the name &quot;Patty&quot; was inspired by another child actress named Patty McCormack.

Cary Grant (born Archibald Alec Leach) had his name selected for him by Paramount Pictures. He had been using the name &quot;Cary Lockwood&quot;, but the studio decided against it, deeming it too similar to another actor working at the time. Cary and the studio eventually settled on &quot;Cary Grant&quot; (Grant thought the letters &quot;C&quot; and &quot;G&quot; to be lucky: they had brought previous success for both Clark Gable and Gary Cooper). Joan Crawford, born Lucille Fay LeSueur, had her name changed as a result of a magazine poll organised by her studio, MGM.

Gorden Kaye (born Gordon Kaye) had one letter in his first name changed owing to a spelling error by the British Actors&#x27; Equity Association; he preferred the mistake over his original name.

== Ethnicity ==
In the past, a stage name was often used when a performer&#x27;s real name was considered to denote a specific ethnicity that faced potential discrimination. In other cases, actors have reinvented themselves with a more ethnic identity, when that gave them an advantage in playing &quot;ethnic&quot; roles.

Steven Tyler of Aerosmith changed his name from Steven Victor Tallarico &quot;for more promotional appeal&quot;.

Historically, Jews in Hollywood were encouraged to anglicize their names to avoid possible discrimination. Examples of such name changes are Danny Kaye and Mel Brooks, both of whom were born with the surname Kaminsky, the original two lineups of The Three Stooges (born Moses Horwitz, Jerome Horwitz, Samuel Horwitz and Louis Feinberg) and Woody Allen (born Allen Konigsberg). Jon Stewart claims that he did not anglicize his name for career reasons, but because of his estranged relationship with his father. Israeli-American Natalie Portman, born Natalie Hershlag, changed her name allegedly to protect her privacy. James Goldman, retired television anchorman, has stated that he chose the name Jim Gardner because of the thought that there were too many people with Jewish last names on staff.

Ramón Estévez changed his name to Martin Sheen as he felt it affected his job prospects owing to racial discrimination and bias, although he maintains his birth name for legal documents such as his passport; his sons made divergent choices: Carlos Irwin Estévez is now Charlie Sheen, while Emilio Estevez left his name unchanged. German-born actor Hans Gudegast adopted the stage name of Eric Braeden.

Actors Anthony Quinn and Anne Bancroft were advised to anglicize their names because &#x27;Antonio Rodolfo Quinn Oaxaca&#x27; and &#x27;Anna Maria Louisa Italiano&#x27;, respectively, were considered too &#x27;ethnic&#x27; for Hollywood and Broadway at the time. Eydie Gorme (born Edith Garmezano), Sophia Loren (born Sofia Villani Scicolone), Charles Bronson (born Charles Dennis Buchinsky), and Rita Hayworth (born Margarita Carmen Cansino), are four more well-known examples of this trend.

Broadcaster Dave Roberts was born David T. Boreanaz but was known professionally as Dave Thomas and later Dave Roberts as ethnic surnames were discouraged when he first began his career during the 1950s; his son, actor David Boreanaz, chose not to adopt a stage name.

The use of stage names for ethnic purposes may vary widely depending on the media market the personality is representing. For example, in Buffalo, New York, a city with a large Polish-American population, Polish-American media personalities typically work freely using their birth names.

Sicilian-American actor Espera Oscar de Corti, who built his film career portraying Native Americans, reinvented himself as Iron Eyes Cody. He not only took his stage name as his legal name but eventually began insisting that he actually was Native American.

Actress Bernadette Peters (born Bernadette Lazzara) was encouraged as a child actress to use her father&#x27;s first name, Peter as her last name by her mother to avoid being type-cast in Italian roles.

Chloe Bennet had used her birth name, Chloe Wang, for her singing career in China, along with a short-lived TeenNick music series. She started using the surname Bennet, after her father&#x27;s first name, when she failed to be welcomed by Hollywood agents. In reverse, Nichole Bloom, an actress with mixed Japanese-Irish parentage, changed her stage name to her birth name of Nichole Sakura in the wake of the summer of 2020, to honor her Japanese heritage; she had originally used Bloom, an English equivalent to Sakura (meaning cherry blossom) out of a fear of typecasting.

== Ease of use ==
Another consideration in choosing a stage name is the ease of use. The Actors&#x27; Equity Association (AEA) advises performers to select a name that is easy for others to pronounce, spell, and remember. Some performers, while paying great attention to their skills and abilities, give little thought to the difference that a well-thought-out name can make to their career. Often a person or group decides on a different name only after they realize that a poorly chosen name gives a bad impression.

Actor Michael Caine was born Maurice Micklewhite and chose his new first name because he preferred the sound of it to the less glamorous-sounding &quot;Maurice&quot;. He reputedly chose the surname &quot;Caine&quot; because, while deciding on a new surname, he looked across the street and saw a cinema advertising the film &quot;The Caine Mutiny&quot;. He later joked that he would be called &quot;Michael The One Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot; if he had looked in the other direction. Actor Pete Postlethwaite was advised to change his surname by peers who quipped that it &quot;would never be put up in lights outside theaters because they couldn&#x27;t afford the electricity&quot;, but he decided to keep it. In a similar situation, Doris Day (born Doris Kappelhoff) was told by a bandleader that her name would never fit on the marquee, and she thus took the surname &quot;Day&quot; because the song &quot;Day By Day&quot; had become one of her signature tracks.

== Relevance to image ==
Ching Lau Lauro (1806?–1840) used a Chinese stage name to represent his stage image as a contortionist in Chinese costume. Believed to be a Cornishman, he was probably the first European magician to dress in Chinese costume on stage.

Commonly in the music world, especially those of heavy metal, punk rock, industrial, and hip hop, musicians will rename themselves with names more menacing or striking than their birth names. Every member of the punk band Ramones took the pseudonymous &quot;Ramone&quot; surname as part of their collective stage persona. Members of New Zealand art-rock band Split Enz all took their middle names as stage names, so as to keep their private image separate from their public personae.

Other performers may assume stage names as a means of distancing themselves from publicly known childhood names that could be considered professionally embarrassing, outlandish, or otherwise inappropriate. Film director Duncan Jones (son of singer David Bowie) was known publicly as a child as Zowie Bowie.

Rappers are known to use stage names, such as Jay-Z (Shawn Carter), 50 Cent (Curtis Jackson), Diddy (Sean Combs), Young Thug (Jeffery Williams), Ludacris (Chris Bridges), Lil Wayne (Dwayne Carter Jr.), and Soulja Boy (DeAndre Way). At times, these artists will use their real names to make some of their material seem more authentic or personal. Eminem (Marshall Mathers) took his stage name from the pronunciation of his initials (M and M), and later used his real name at various public events and as an alter ego after his real name gained recognition following the release of his multi-platinum album &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot;. LL Cool J (James Todd Smith) referenced his real name on the albums &quot;Mr. Smith&quot; and &quot;Todd Smith&quot;. Queen Latifah (Dana Owens) released &quot;The Dana Owens Album&quot; after changing her focus from hip-hop to jazz. Xzibit (Alvin Joiner) has also been credited by his real name when acting in several television shows.

==Euphony and ease of remembrance==
Some performers and artists may choose to simplify their name to make it easier to spell and pronounce, and easier for others to remember. For instance, Fall Out Boy vocalist and guitarist Patrick Stump removed the &quot;h&quot; from his original surname, Stumph. It was still pronounced &quot;stump&quot;, but the change ensured his audience would not think to pronounce it &quot;stumf&quot;. Singer Jason Derulo (known for announcing his name in many of the introductions of his songs) uses the phonetic spelling of his given name, Jason Desrouleaux. Australian actress Yvonne Strahovski adopted a phonetic spelling of her surname, Strzechowski, as her stage name upon moving to the United States. American stand-up comedian Louis C.K. adopted his stage name from the phonetic spelling of his Hungarian surname, Székely.

Andy Warhol dropped an &quot;a&quot; from his original name, Warhola, while couturier Yves Mathieu-Saint-Laurent dropped the first of his two surnames. Rodolfo Alfonso Raffaello Piero Filiberto Guglielmi adopted the stage name Rudolph Valentino in part because American casting directors found his original surname difficult to pronounce. Singer George Michael (the son of a Greek Cypriot restaurateur in North London) was born Georgios Kyriacos Panayiotou.

Some surnames may carry unfortunate connotations. Hal Linden, born Harold Lipshitz, adopted his stage name for fear that the embedded obscenity in his original surname could cost him work. Ralph Lauren&#x27;s brother (who was his guardian) changed their family name from Lifshitz for a similar reason: fear of mockery. Duran Duran&#x27;s Nick Rhodes, born Nicholas James Bates, changed his name to escape childhood ridicule (as a child, children would often tease him by calling him &quot;Master Bates&quot;); he adopted the surname &quot;Rhodes&quot; after the keyboard manufacturer of the same name. Diana Dors was born Diana Fluck (one letter away from a profanity); this prompted her to change her name to a more benign one in order to avoid an accidental obscenity (which could have been exacerbated by her status as a sex symbol).

== Musical use ==

Some types of music are more associated with stage names than others. For example, hip hop and EDM artists almost always use stage names, whereas &quot;classical&quot; composers and performers rarely do. Classical violinist Amadéus Leopold (born in South Korea as Yoo Hanbin) and opera singers Beverly Sills (born Belle Miriam Silverman), Nellie Melba (born Helen Porter Mitchell) and Jennifer Toye (born Jennifer Gay Bishop) are exceptions.

Some Algerian raï musicians use the prefix Cheb (for men) or Chaba (Chebba) for women. Both Arabic words mean &quot;young&quot; (e.g. as in Cheb Khaled, or &quot;Young Khaled&quot;). 

John Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin was born John Baldwin. This is still his legal name, John Paul Jones being his professional name.

Some performers take a series of different stage names. The British pop singer who was successful in the 1970s as Alvin Stardust previously went by the stage name of &quot;Shane Fenton&quot; in the 1960s. He had been born &quot;Bernard William Jewry&quot;. Some performers will use different names in different settings. Charles Thompson, singer-songwriter for the alternative band the Pixies, was known in that band as &quot;Black Francis&quot;. He was called &quot;Frank Black&quot; as a solo performer and again called &quot;Black Francis&quot; in a reunited Pixies.

Unlike Hollywood stage names, many musical artists&#x27; stage names are obviously not personal names, but they may still end up universally used to refer to the performer, such as Lady Gaga. At times the line may be blurred between the name of an act and the stage name of the lead.

Many performers refer to their stage name as their &quot;professional name&quot;. For instance David Jones became David Bowie in order to avoid confusion with Davy Jones of the Monkees but retained Jones as his legal name. In some cases, performers subsequently adopt their stage name as their legal name. For instance, the former Robert Allen Zimmerman&#x27;s legal name has been Robert Dylan (Bob Dylan) since he changed it in New York City Supreme Court in August 1962. Elton John was born Reginald Kenneth Dwight but changed his name by deed poll, making Elton Hercules John his real name. When he was knighted, he became Sir Elton Hercules John rather than Sir Reginald Kenneth Dwight. Similarly, Freddie Mercury was born Farrokh Bulsara, but legally changed his name concurrently with the formation of Queen. Elvis Costello (born Declan MacManus), who had adopted his professional name as a legal name, changed it back to his birth name in 1986. Another example is Marvin Lee Aday, known by his stage name Meat Loaf. In a similar way, actress and singer Miley Cyrus was born Destiny Hope Cyrus but found &quot;Miley&quot; more comfortable, making it her legal name.

Entire musical groups have been known to adopt a common stage surname, the most notable arguably being the Ramones. Recent examples include The Donnas, Those Darlins, Los Campesinos! and Ween.

<doc id="53414" wikidata="Q203736" url="?curid=53414" title="Cream (band)">
<text>Cream were a British rock supergroup formed in London in 1966. The group consisted of bassist Jack Bruce, guitarist Eric Clapton and drummer Ginger Baker. Bruce was the primary songwriter and vocalist, although Clapton and Baker contributed to songs. Formed by members of previously successful bands, they are widely considered the first supergroup. Cream were highly regarded for the instrumental proficiency of each of their members.

During their brief three-year career, the band released four albums: &quot;Fresh Cream&quot; (1966), &quot;Disraeli Gears&quot; (1967), &quot;Wheels of Fire&quot; (1968), and &quot;Goodbye&quot; (1969). Beginning with &quot;Disraeli Gears&quot;, the band was joined in the studio by producer and multi-instrumentalist Felix Pappalardi. Their music spanned rock styles such as blues rock, psychedelia, and hard rock. Throughout their career, they sold more than 15 million records worldwide. The group&#x27;s third album, &quot;Wheels of Fire&quot; (1968), is the first platinum-selling double album. They scored international hits with singles such as &quot;Sunshine of Your Love&quot; (1967) and &quot;White Room&quot; (1968).

Tensions between Bruce and Baker led to their decision in May 1968 to break up, although the band were persuaded to make a final album, &quot;Goodbye&quot;, and to tour, culminating in two final farewell concerts at the Royal Albert Hall on 25 and 26 November 1968 which were filmed and shown in theatres, then in 1977 released as a home video, &quot;Farewell Concert&quot;. Bruce died in 2014 followed by Baker in 2019, leaving Clapton as the only surviving member of the group.

In 1993, Cream were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. They were included in both &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and VH1&#x27;s lists of the &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot;, at number 67 and 61 respectively. They were also ranked number 16 on VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock&quot;.

==History==
===Formation (1966)===
By July 1966, Eric Clapton&#x27;s career with the Yardbirds and John Mayall &amp; the Bluesbreakers had earned him a reputation as the premier blues guitarist in Britain. Clapton, however, found the environment of Mayall&#x27;s band confining, and sought to expand his playing in a new band. In 1966, Clapton met Ginger Baker, then the drummer of the Graham Bond Organisation, for which Jack Bruce had played bass guitar, harmonica and piano. Baker felt stifled in the Graham Bond Organisation and had grown tired of Graham Bond&#x27;s drug addictions and bouts of mental instability. &quot;I had always liked Ginger&quot;, explained Clapton. &quot;Ginger had come to see me play with the Bluesbreakers. After the gig he drove me back to London in his Rover. I was very impressed with his car and driving. He was telling me that he wanted to start a band, and I had been thinking about it too.&quot;

Each was impressed with the other&#x27;s playing abilities, prompting Baker to ask Clapton to join his new, then-unnamed group. Clapton immediately agreed, on the condition that Baker hire Bruce, who had joined Manfred Mann since leaving Graham Bond, as the group&#x27;s bassist; according to Clapton, Baker was so surprised at the suggestion that he almost crashed the car. Clapton had met Bruce when the bassist/vocalist briefly played with the Bluesbreakers in November 1965; the two also had recorded together as part of an &quot;ad hoc&quot; group dubbed Powerhouse (which also included Steve Winwood and Paul Jones). Impressed with Bruce&#x27;s vocals and technical prowess, Clapton wanted to work with him on an ongoing basis.

In contrast, while Bruce was in Bond&#x27;s band, he and Baker had been notorious for their quarrelling. Their volatile relationship included on-stage fights and the sabotage of one another&#x27;s instruments. After Baker fired Bruce from the band, Bruce continued to arrive for gigs; ultimately, Bruce was driven away from the band after Baker threatened him at knifepoint.

Baker and Bruce tried to put aside their differences for the good of Baker&#x27;s new trio, which he envisioned as collaborative, with each of the members contributing to music and lyrics. The band was named &quot;Cream&quot;, as Clapton, Bruce, and Baker were already considered the &quot;cream of the crop&quot; among blues and jazz musicians in the exploding British music scene. Initially, the group were referred to and billed as &quot;The Cream&quot;, but starting officially with its first record releases, the trio came to be known as &quot;Cream&quot;. Despite this, the band was referred to as &quot;The Cream&quot; on several occasions by promoters and disc jockeys, and even on occasion by the band members themselves. Before deciding upon &quot;Cream&quot;, the band considered calling themselves &quot;Sweet &#x27;n&#x27; Sour Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;. Of the trio, Clapton had the biggest reputation in England; however, he was unknown in the United States, having left the Yardbirds before &quot;For Your Love&quot; hit the American Top Ten.

The band made its unofficial debut at the Twisted Wheel on 29 July 1966. Its official debut came two nights later at the Sixth Annual Windsor Jazz &amp; Blues Festival. Being new and with few original songs to its credit, they performed blues reworkings that thrilled the large crowd and earned it a warm reception. In October the band also got a chance to jam with Jimi Hendrix, who had recently arrived in London. Hendrix was a fan of Clapton&#x27;s music, and wanted a chance to play with him onstage.

It was during the early organisation that they decided Bruce would serve as the group&#x27;s lead vocalist. While Clapton was shy about singing, he occasionally harmonised with Bruce, and in time, took lead vocals on several Cream tracks including &quot;Four Until Late&quot;, &quot;Strange Brew&quot;, &quot;World of Pain&quot;, &quot;Outside Woman Blues&quot;, &quot;Crossroads&quot;, and &quot;Badge&quot;.

===&quot;Fresh Cream&quot; (1966)===

The band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Fresh Cream&quot;, was recorded and released in 1966. The album reached number 6 in the UK charts and number 39 in the US. It was evenly split between self-penned originals and blues covers, including &quot;Four Until Late&quot;, &quot;Rollin&#x27; and Tumblin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Spoonful&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m So Glad&quot; and &quot;Cat&#x27;s Squirrel&quot;. The rest of the songs were written by either Jack Bruce or Ginger Baker. (&quot;I Feel Free&quot;, a UK hit single, was included on only the American edition of the LP.) The track &quot;Toad&quot; contained one of the earliest examples of a drum solo in rock music as Ginger Baker expanded upon his early composition &quot;Camels and Elephants&quot;, written in 1965 with the Graham Bond Organisation.

===&quot;Disraeli Gears&quot; (1967)===

The band first visited the US in March 1967 to play nine dates at the RKO 58th Street Theatre in New York City. There was little impact, as impresario Murray the K placed them at the bottom of a six-act bill that performed three times per date, eventually reducing the band to one song per concert. They returned to record &quot;Disraeli Gears&quot; in New York between 11 and 15 May 1967. This, the band&#x27;s second album, was released in November 1967 and reached the top five in the charts on both sides of the Atlantic. Produced by Felix Pappalardi (who later co-founded the Cream-influenced hard rock band Mountain) and engineer Tom Dowd, it was recorded at Atlantic Studios in New York. &quot;Disraeli Gears&quot; is often considered to be the band&#x27;s defining effort, successfully blending psychedelic British rock with American blues.

&quot;Disraeli Gears&quot; also included &quot;Sunshine of Your Love&quot;, which became the group&#x27;s highest-charting song, peaking at number five on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.
The album was originally slated for release in the summer of 1967, but the record label opted to scrap the planned cover and repackage it with a new psychedelic cover, designed by artist Martin Sharp, and the resulting changes delayed its release for several months. The cover was remarkable for the time, with a psychedelic design patterned over a publicity photo of the trio.

In August 1967, the band played their first headlining dates in the US, first at The Fillmore in San Francisco and later at The Pinnacle in Los Angeles. The concerts were a great success and proved very influential on both the band itself and the flourishing hippie scene surrounding them. Upon discovering a growing listening audience, the band began to stretch out on stage, incorporating more time in their repertoire, some songs reaching jams of twenty minutes. Long, drawn-out jams in numbers like &quot;Spoonful&quot;, &quot;N.S.U.&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m So Glad&quot;, and &quot;Sweet Wine&quot; became live favourites, while songs like &quot;Sunshine of Your Love&quot;, &quot;Crossroads&quot;, and &quot;Tales of Brave Ulysses&quot; remained reasonably short.

===&quot;Wheels of Fire&quot; (1968)===
In 1968 came the band&#x27;s third release, &quot;Wheels of Fire&quot;, which topped the American charts. The album was recorded in a spate of short sessions from July 1967 to June 1968. Still a relative novelty, the double album of two LP records was well-suited to extended solos. The &quot;Wheels of Fire&quot; studio recordings showcased the band moving away from the blues and more towards a semi-progressive rock style highlighted by odd time signatures and various orchestral instruments. However, the band did record Howlin&#x27; Wolf&#x27;s &quot;Sitting on Top of the World&quot; and Albert King&#x27;s &quot;Born Under a Bad Sign&quot;. According to a BBC interview with Clapton, the record company, Atco Records, also handling Albert King, asked the band to cover &quot;Born Under a Bad Sign&quot;, which became a popular track off the record. The opening song, &quot;White Room&quot;, became a radio staple. Another song, &quot;Politician&quot;, was written by the band while waiting to perform live at the BBC. The album&#x27;s second disc included three live recordings from the Winterland Ballroom and one from the Fillmore. Clapton&#x27;s second solo from &quot;Crossroads&quot; has made it to the top 20 in multiple &quot;greatest guitar solo&quot; lists.

After the completion of &quot;Wheels of Fire&quot; in mid-1968, the band members had grown tired of their exhausting touring schedule and increasingly loud jamming, and wanted to go their separate ways. Baker stated in a 2006 interview with &quot;Music Mart&quot; magazine, &quot;It just got to the point where Eric said to me: &#x27;I&#x27;ve had enough of this&#x27;, and I said so have I. I couldn&#x27;t stand it. The last year with Cream was just agony. It damaged my hearing permanently, and today I&#x27;ve still got a hearing problem because of the sheer volume throughout the last year of Cream. But it didn&#x27;t start off like that. In 1966, it was great. It was really a wonderful experience musically, and it just went into the realms of stupidity.&quot; Bruce and Baker&#x27;s combustible relationship proved even worse as a result of the strain put upon the band by non-stop touring, forcing Clapton to play the perpetual role of peacekeeper.

Clapton had also become interested in the music of Bob Dylan&#x27;s former backing group, now known as the Band, and their debut album, &quot;Music from Big Pink&quot;, which proved to be a welcome breath of fresh air to Clapton in comparison to the psychedelia and volume that had defined Cream. Furthermore, he had read a scathing Cream review in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, a publication he had much admired, in which the reviewer, Jon Landau, called him a &quot;master of the blues cliché&quot;. In the wake of that article, Clapton wanted to end Cream and pursue a different musical direction.

At the beginning of the band&#x27;s farewell tour on 4 October 1968, in Oakland, California, nearly the entire set consisted of songs from &quot;Wheels of Fire&quot;: &quot;White Room&quot;, &quot;Politician&quot;, &quot;Crossroads&quot;, &quot;Spoonful&quot;, and &quot;Deserted Cities of the Heart&quot;, with &quot;Passing the Time&quot; taking the place of &quot;Toad&quot; for a drum solo. &quot;Passing the Time&quot; and &quot;Deserted Cities&quot; were quickly removed from the setlist and replaced by &quot;Sitting on Top of the World&quot; and &quot;Toad&quot;.

===&quot;Goodbye&quot; and break-up (1968–1969)===
From its creation, Cream was faced with some fundamental problems that would later lead to its dissolution in November 1968. The antagonism between Bruce and Baker created tensions in the band. Clapton also felt that the members of the band did not listen to each other enough. Equipment during these years had also improved; new Marshall amplifier stacks produced more power, and Jack Bruce pushed the volume levels higher, creating tension for Baker, who would have trouble competing with roaring stacks. Clapton spoke of a concert during which he stopped playing and neither Baker nor Bruce noticed. Clapton has also commented that Cream&#x27;s later gigs mainly consisted of its members showing off.

Cream decided that they would break up in May 1968 during a tour of the US. Later, in July, the band announced that they would break up after a farewell tour of the US and after playing two concerts in London. Jack Bruce was quoted as saying &quot;Travel can kill a group. It becomes boring, tiring and very depressing.&quot;

Cream were eventually persuaded to do one final album, appropriately titled &quot;Goodbye&quot;. The album was recorded in late 1968 and released in early 1969, after the band had broken up. It comprised six songs: three live recordings dating from a concert at The Forum in Los Angeles, California, on 19 October, and three new studio recordings (including &quot;Badge&quot;, which was written by Clapton and George Harrison, who also played rhythm guitar and was credited as &quot;L&#x27;Angelo Misterioso&quot;). &quot;I&#x27;m So Glad&quot; was included among the live tracks.

Cream&#x27;s farewell tour consisted of 22 shows at 19 venues in the US from 4 October to 4 November 1968, and two final farewell concerts at the Royal Albert Hall on 25 and 26 November 1968. The final US gig was at the Rhode Island Auditorium on 4 November. The band arrived late, and due to local restrictions, were able to perform only two songs, &quot;Toad&quot; and a 20+ minute version of &quot;Spoonful&quot;. The two Royal Albert Hall concerts were filmed for a BBC documentary and released on video (and later DVD) as &quot;Farewell Concert&quot;. Both shows were sold out and attracted more attention than any other Cream concert, but their performance was regarded by many as below standard. Baker himself said of the concerts: &quot;It wasn&#x27;t a good gig ... Cream was better than that ... We knew it was all over. We knew we were just finishing it off, getting it over with.&quot; Bruce had three Marshall stacks on stage for the farewell shows but one acted only as a spare, and he only used one or two, depending on the song. In an interview from &quot;Cream: Classic Artists&quot;, he added that the band was getting worse by the minute.

===Post-Cream===
Blind Faith, a band that included both Clapton and Baker, was formed after the demise of Cream, following an attempt by Clapton to recruit Steve Winwood into Cream in the hope that he would help act as a buffer between Bruce and Baker. Inspired by more song-based acts, Clapton went on to perform very different, less improvisational material with Delaney &amp; Bonnie, Derek and the Dominos, and in his own long and varied solo career.

Bruce began a varied and successful solo career with the 1969 release of &quot;Songs for a Tailor&quot;, while Baker formed a jazz-fusion ensemble, Ginger Baker&#x27;s Air Force, from the remnants of Blind Faith, with Winwood, Blind Faith bassist Rick Grech, Graham Bond on saxophone, and guitarist Denny Laine of the Moody Blues and (later) Wings.

All three members continued to explore new musical ideas and partnerships, play concerts and record music for over four decades after ending Cream.

===Reunions===
====Rock and Roll Hall of Fame====

In 1993, Cream were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and re-formed to perform at the induction ceremony. Initially, the trio were wary about performing, until encouraging words from Robbie Robertson inspired them to try. The set consisted of &quot;Sunshine of Your Love&quot;, &quot;Crossroads&quot;, and &quot;Born Under a Bad Sign&quot;, a song they had previously played live just three times. Clapton mentioned in his acceptance speech that their rehearsal the day before the ceremony had marked the first time they had played together in 25 years. This performance spurred rumours of a reunion tour. Bruce and Baker said in later interviews that they were, indeed, interested in touring as Cream. A formal reunion did not take place immediately, as Clapton, Bruce and Baker continued to pursue solo projects, although the latter two worked together again in the mid-1990s as two-thirds of the power trio BBM with Irish blues rock guitarist Gary Moore.

====2005 concerts====
At Clapton&#x27;s request, Cream reunited for a series of four shows, on 2, 3, 5, and 6 May 2005 at the Royal Albert Hall in London, the venue of their final concerts in 1968. Although the three musicians chose not to speak publicly about the shows, Clapton would later state that he had become more &quot;generous&quot; in regard to his past, and that the physical health of Bruce and Baker was a major factor: Bruce had recently undergone a transplant for liver cancer in 2003, and had almost lost his life, while Baker had severe arthritis.

Tickets for all four shows sold out in under an hour. The performances were recorded for a live CD and DVD. Among those in attendance were Bill Wyman, Steve Winwood, Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Roger Waters, Brian May, Jimmy Page, and Mick Taylor. The reunion marked the first time the band had played &quot;Badge&quot; and &quot;Pressed Rat and Warthog&quot; live.

Inspired by the success of the reunion, the band agreed to an additional set of three shows at the Madison Square Garden in New York City, from 24 to 26 October 2005. According to Clapton, these concerts did not live up to the Royal Albert Hall performances due to, among other reasons, lack of rehearsal and the resurgence of old grudges among band members.

===Post-2005===
In February 2006, Cream received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in recognition of their contribution to, and influence upon, modern music. That same month, a &quot;Classic Albums&quot; DVD was released detailing the story behind the creation and recording of &quot;Disraeli Gears&quot;. On the day prior to the Grammy ceremony, Bruce made a public statement that more one-off performances of Cream had been planned: multiple dates in a few cities, similar to the Royal Albert Hall and Madison Square Garden shows.

However, this story was denied by both Clapton and Baker, first by Clapton in &quot;The Times&quot; in April 2006. When asked about Cream, Clapton said: &quot;No. Not for me. We did it and it was fun. But life is too short. I&#x27;ve got lots of other things I would rather do, including staying at home with my kids. The thing about that band was that it was all to do with its limits ... it was an experiment.&quot; In an interview in the UK magazine &quot;Music Mart&quot;, about the release of a DVD about the Blind Faith concert in Hyde Park 1969, Baker commented about his unwillingness to continue the Cream reunion. These comments were far more specific and explosive than Clapton&#x27;s, as they were centred around his relationship with Jack Bruce. Ginger said, &quot;When he&#x27;s Dr. Jekyll, he&#x27;s fine ... It&#x27;s when he&#x27;s Mr. Hyde that he&#x27;s not. And I&#x27;m afraid he&#x27;s still the same. I tell you this – there won&#x27;t ever be any more Cream gigs, because he did Mr. Hyde in New York last year.&quot;

When asked to elaborate, Baker replied:
Baker and Bruce appeared on stage in London when Baker was awarded a lifetime achievement award by legendary cymbal manufacturer Zildjian. Bruce told Detroit&#x27;s WCSX radio station in May 2007 that there were plans for a Cream reunion later in the year. It was later revealed that the potential performance was to be November 2007 in London as a tribute to Ahmet Ertegun. The band decided against it and this was confirmed by Bruce in a letter to the editor of the Jack Bruce fanzine, &quot;The Cuicoland Express&quot;, dated 26 September 2007:
The headlining act for the O2 Arena Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert (postponed to December 2007) turned out to be from another reunited English hard-rock act, Led Zeppelin. In an interview with BBC 6 Music in April 2010, Bruce confirmed that there would be no more Cream shows, stating simply, &quot;Cream is over.&quot; Bruce died on 25 October 2014 and Baker died on 6 October 2019, leaving Clapton as the last surviving member.

==Style==
The members of Cream were described by Richie Unterberger of AllMusic as &quot;[yearning] to break free of the confines of the standard rock/R&amp;B/blues group&quot;. He described the band&#x27;s first album &quot;Fresh Cream&quot; as &quot;electrified and amped-up traditional blues&quot;, and described the band&#x27;s second album &quot;Disraeli Gears&quot; as &quot;invigorating, sometimes hard-driving psychedelic pop&quot; that used &quot;expected, crunching&quot; guitar riffs.

<text>Wallace Kirkman Harrison (September 28, 1895 – December 2, 1981) was an American architect. Harrison started his professional career with the firm of Corbett, Harrison &amp; MacMurray, participating in the construction of Rockefeller Center. He is best known for executing large public projects in New York City and upstate, many of them a result of his long and fruitful personal relationship with Nelson Rockefeller, for whom he served as an adviser.
==Career==
Harrison&#x27;s work in the mid-20th century comprised large, modernist public projects and office buildings. As a young man, Harrison took classes in engineering at Worcester Polytechnic Institute and in architecture at the Boston Architectural Club; he studied at the École des Beaux-Arts in the early 1920s and won the Rotch Taveling Scholarship in 1922. He worked for McKim, Mead &amp; White and Bertram Grovesnor Goodhue from 1916 to 1923, and later formed a series of architectural partnerships. Harrison participated with the architectural teams involved in the construction of Rockefeller Center in New York City, completed in 1939. His brother-in-law was married to John D. Rockefeller Jr.&#x27;s daughter, Abigail and Harrison served as a designer and architectural adviser for Nelson Rockefeller, notably in the years when Rockefeller was governor of New York.

In 1941, Harrison joined with Max Abramowitz to form the firm of Harrison &amp; Abramowitz. In partnership with Abramovitz, Harrison designed scores of university and corporate buildings, including the Time &amp; Life (1959) and Socony-Mobil (1956), both designated New York City landmarks.

Among Harrison&#x27;s most noted projects are the Metropolitan Opera House at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts and the Empire State Plaza in Albany; he also served as Director of Planning on the United Nations complex, which was built on slaughter-house property contributed by the Rockefeller family (the Rockefellers owned the Tudor City Apartments across First Avenue). Harrision also developed the design for the Pershing Memorial in Washington, D.C. (today referred to as &quot;Pershing Park&quot;, and home to the National World War I Memorial. In addition to his architectural work, Harrison served as master planner and supervising architect for a number of important Long Island-based projects, including the World&#x27;s Fairs of 1939 and 1964 in Flushing, Queens, and LaGuardia and Idlewild (now John F. Kennedy) airports.

Harrison&#x27;s major projects are marked by straightforward planning and sensible functionalism, although his residential side-projects show more experimental flair. In 1931, Harrison established an summer retreat in West Hills, New York, which was a very early example and workshop for the International Style in the United States, and a social and intellectual center of architecture, art, and politics. The home includes a circular living room that is rumored to have been the prototype for the Rainbow Room in Rockefeller Center. Two other circular rooms complete the center of Harrison&#x27;s design. Frequent visitors and guests included Nelson Rockefeller, Robert Moses, Marc Chagall, Le Corbusier, Alexander Calder, and Fernand Léger. Harrison&#x27;s expansive country property also exhibited his relationships with contemporary architects. For example, shortly after purchasing the property in 1931, Harrison and his wife bought the Aluminaire House, an iconic, compact, ready-to-assemble steel-and-aluminum structure designed by Swiss architect Albert Frey and then editor of Architectural Record, A. Lawrence Kocher.

Harrison collected works by Calder and Léger and commissioned new ones for buildings that he designed, including his Long Island country house in West Hills, New York; a pavilion at the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair; parts of Rockefeller Center; and the United Nations headquarters. Léger waited out part of World War II by painting a mural at the bottom of Harrison&#x27;s swimming pool. Léger also created a large mural for the home&#x27;s circular living room and sculpted an abstract form to serve as a skylight. Calder&#x27;s first show is said to have taken place at the home. In 1965, Harrison was appointed to a commission to choose modern art works for the Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller Empire State Plaza Art Collection in Albany, NY.

Between 1941 and 1943, Harrison designed and built the Clinton Hill Coops, a 12-building coop complex split between two &quot;campuses&quot; along Clinton Ave. in Brooklyn, New York, to house the Brooklyn Navy Yards workers.

Harrison&#x27;s architectural drawings and archives are held by the Drawings and Archives Department of Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library at Columbia University.

Harrison was a member of the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts from 1955 to 1959. In 1967, Harrison received the AIA Gold Medal. In 1938, he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and became a full Academician in 1948.

<text>Raymond Mathewson Hood (March 29, 1881 – August 14, 1934) was an American architect who worked in the Neo-Gothic and Art Deco styles. He is best known for his designs of the Tribune Tower, American Radiator Building, and Rockefeller Center. Through a short yet highly successful career, Hood exerted an outsized influence on twentieth century architecture.

==Early life and education==

=== Early life ===
Raymond Mathewson Hood was born in Pawtucket, Rhode Island on March 29, 1881, to John Parmenter Hood and Vella Mathewson. John Hood was the owner of J.N. Polsey &amp; Co., a crate and box manufacturing company. The family lived at 107 Cottage Street in a house designed by John Hood and local architect Albert H. Humes. In a 1931 profile of Hood in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, writer Allene Talmey described the Hood home as &quot;the ugliest place in town.&quot; In 1893, the Hood family visited the World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, an experience that may have sparked Hood&#x27;s interest in architecture.

=== Education ===
In 1898, Hood graduated from Pawtucket High School. Later that year Hood enrolled at Brown University. At Brown he studied mathematics, rhetoric, French, and drawing. In 1899, seeking more opportunities to pursue an architectural education, Hood enrolled at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

At MIT, Hood studied under Constant-Désiré Despradelle, a prominent proponent of the Beaux-Arts style. Hood excelled at creating meticulously rendered architectural drawings, and after graduating worked as a draftsman for Cram, Goodhue and Ferguson. During his time at Cram, Goodhue and Ferguson, Hood purportedly worked on the 1899 design of the Classical Revival Deborah Cook Sayles Public Library.In June 1904, Hood returned to Pawtucket before leaving for Europe with the intention of studying at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. Hood failed his first attempt at the entrance exam in October 1904 though was accepted after his second attempt in 1905. His capstone &quot;diplôme&quot; project at the École was a city hall for Pawtucket, his hometown. The project, which was never realized, fused classical features with modern technology.

== Career ==
In 1911, Hood returned to the US, taking a job at the office of Henry Hornbostel in Pittsburgh.

In 1916, Hood designed an ambitious plan for downtown Providence; the project&#x27;s defining feature was a civic tower, whose pedimented base occupied the entire southern edge of Exchange Place. The plan, which was likewise never realized, was published in &quot;The Providence Journal&quot; under the headline &quot;A Striking Plan for Dignifying Civic Centre.&quot;

=== Chicago Tribune Tower ===

In 1922, New York architect John Mead Howells, who had met him at the École des Beaux-Arts, invited Hood to become his partner in the Chicago Tribune building competition in which Howells had been invited to compete. The neo-Gothic design submitted by Howells and Hood won the competition beating the designs of prominent competitors, including Eliel Saarinen, Walter Gropius, and Adolf Loos.

The design proved pivotal in Hood&#x27;s career, catalyzing his emergence as a preeminent architect of the era.

=== American Radiator Building ===

Among the commissions received by Hood in the immediate wake of his design for the Tribune Tower, was a design for a new New York office tower for the American Radiator Company. In his 1924 design for the building, produced in collaboration with architect Jacques André Fouilhoux, Hood moved towards a looser interpretation of Gothic architecture, cladding the structure in black brick. The design was additionally noted for its revolutionary use of lighting. According to art and architectural historian Dietrich Neumann, the design &quot;helped to introduce a new age of color and light in American architecture.&quot;

== Approach ==
Hood did not consider himself an artist, but saw himself as &quot;manufacturing shelter&quot;, writing:

There has been entirely too much talk about the collaboration of architect, painter and sculptor; nowadays, the collaborators are the architects, the engineer, and the plumber. ... Buildings are constructed for certain purposes, and the buildings of today are more practical, from the standpoint of the man who is in them than the older buildings. ... We are considering effort and convenience much more than appearance or effect.

Hood&#x27;s design theory was aligned with that of the Bauhaus, in that he valued utility as beauty:

Beauty is utility, developed in a manner to which the eye is accustomed by habit, in so far as this development does not detract from its quality of usefulness.

Despite this paean to utility, Hood&#x27;s designs featured non-utilitarian aspects such as roof gardens, polychromy, and Art Deco ornamentation. As much as Hood might insist that his designs were largely determined by the practicalities of zoning laws and the restraints of economics, each of his major buildings were different enough to suggest that Hood&#x27;s design artistry was a significant factor in the final result.

While a student at the École des Beaux-Arts, Hood met John Mead Howells, with whom he later partnered. Hood frequently employed architectural sculptor Rene Paul Chambellan both for architectural sculptures for his building and to make plasticine models of his projects. Hood is believed to have coined the term &quot;Architecture of the Night&quot; in a 1930 pamphlet published by General Electric.

Hood died at age 53 due to arthritis and was interred at Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Sleepy Hollow, New York.

==Influence==
Hood&#x27;s buildings were featured in works by Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe (&quot;Radiator Building—Night, New York,&quot; 1927), Diego Rivera (&quot;Frozen Assets,&quot; 1931), and Berenice Abbott (&quot;McGraw-Hill Building&quot;, 1936; &quot;Fortieth Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenue&quot;, 1938), and Samuel Gottscho (&quot;Rockefeller Center and RCA Building from 515 Madison Ave&quot;, 1933).

<doc id="53418" wikidata="Q14452" url="?curid=53418" title="Easter Island">
<text>Easter Island (, ; , ) is an island and special territory of Chile in the southeastern Pacific Ocean, at the southeasternmost point of the Polynesian Triangle in Oceania. The island is renowned for its nearly 1,000 extant monumental statues, called &quot;moai&quot;, which were created by the early Rapa Nui people. In 1995, UNESCO named Easter Island a World Heritage Site, with much of the island protected within Rapa Nui National Park.

Experts differ on when the island&#x27;s Polynesian inhabitants first reached the island. While many in the research community cited evidence that they arrived around the year 800, a 2007 study provided compelling evidence suggesting their arrival was closer to 1200. The inhabitants created a thriving and industrious culture, as evidenced by the island&#x27;s numerous enormous stone &quot;moai&quot; and other artifacts. But land clearing for cultivation and the introduction of the Polynesian rat led to gradual deforestation. By the time of European arrival in 1722, the island&#x27;s population was estimated to be 2,000 to 3,000. European diseases, Peruvian slave raiding expeditions in the 1860s, and emigration to other islands such as Tahiti further depleted the population, reducing it to a low of 111 native inhabitants in 1877.

Chile annexed Easter Island in 1888. In 1966, the Rapa Nui were granted Chilean citizenship. In 2007, the island gained the constitutional status of &quot;special territory&quot; (). Administratively, it belongs to the Valparaíso Region, constituting a single commune (Isla de Pascua) of the Province of Isla de Pascua. The 2017 Chilean census registered 7,750 people on the island, of which 3,512 (45%) identified as Rapa Nui.

Easter Island is one of the world&#x27;s most remote inhabited islands. The nearest inhabited land (around 50 residents in 2013) is Pitcairn Island, away; the nearest town with a population over 500 is Rikitea, on the island of Mangareva, away; the nearest continental point lies in central Chile, away.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Easter Island&quot; was given by the island&#x27;s first recorded European visitor, the Dutch explorer Jacob Roggeveen, who encountered it on Easter Sunday (April 5) in 1722, while searching for &quot;Davis Land&quot;. Roggeveen named it (18th-century Dutch for &quot;Easter Island&quot;). The island&#x27;s official Spanish name, , also means &quot;Easter Island&quot;.

The current Polynesian name of the island, (&quot;Big Rapa&quot;), was coined after the slave raids of the early 1860s, and refers to the island&#x27;s topographic resemblance to the island of Rapa in the Bass Islands of the Austral Islands group. Norwegian ethnographer Thor Heyerdahl argued that &quot;Rapa&quot; was Easter Island&#x27;s original name and that the Bass Islands&#x27; Rapa (&quot;Rapa Iti&quot;) was named by refugees from it.

The phrase &quot;Te pito o te henua&quot; has been said to be the island&#x27;s original name since French ethnologist Alphonse Pinart gave it the romantic translation &quot;The Navel of the World&quot; in his , published in 1877. William Churchill (1912) inquired about the phrase and was told that there were three &quot;&quot;, these being the three capes (land&#x27;s ends) of the island. The phrase appears to have been used in the same sense as the designation &quot;Land&#x27;s End&quot; at the tip of Cornwall. He was unable to elicit a Polynesian name for the island and concluded that there may not have been one.

According to Barthel (1974), oral tradition has it that the island was first named &quot;Te pito o te kainga a Hau Maka&quot;, meaning &quot;The little piece of land of Hau Maka&quot;. But there are two words pronounced &quot;pito&quot; in Rapa Nui, one meaning &quot;end&quot; and one &quot;navel&quot;, and the phrase can thus also mean &quot;The Navel of the World&quot;. Another name, &quot;Mata ki te rangi&quot;, means &quot;Eyes looking to the sky&quot;.

Islanders are referred to in Spanish as &quot;pascuense&quot;, but members of the indigenous community are commonly called &quot;Rapa Nui&quot;.

Felipe González de Ahedo named it &quot;Isla de San Carlos&quot; (&quot;Saint Charles&#x27;s Island&quot;, the patron saint of Charles III of Spain) or &quot;Isla de David&quot; (probably the phantom island of Davis Land; sometimes translated as &quot;Davis&#x27;s Island&quot;) in 1770.

==History==
===Introduction===
Oral tradition states the island was first settled by a two-canoe expedition originating from Marae Renga (or Marae Toe Hau—otherwise known as Cook Islands), and led by the chief Hotu Matu&#x27;a and his captain Tu&#x27;u ko Iho. The island was first scouted after Haumaka dreamed of such a far-off country; Hotu deemed it a worthwhile place to flee from a neighboring chief, one to whom he had already lost three battles. At their time of arrival, the island had one lone settler, Nga Tavake &#x27;a Te Rona. After a brief stay at Anakena, the colonists settled in different parts of the island. Hotu&#x27;s heir, Tu&#x27;u ma Heke, was born on the island. Tu&#x27;u ko Iho is viewed as the leader who brought the statues and caused them to walk.

The Easter Islanders are considered Southeast Polynesians. Similar sacred zones with statuary (&quot;marae&quot; and &quot;ahu&quot;) in East Polynesia demonstrate homology with most of Eastern Polynesia. At contact, populations were about 3,000–4,000.

By the 15th century, two confederations, &quot;hanau&quot;, of social groupings, &quot;mata&quot;, existed, based on lineage. The western and northern portion of the island belonged to the Tu&#x27;u, which included the royal Miru, with the royal center at Anakena, though Tahai and Te Peu served as earlier capitals. The eastern part of the island belonged to the &#x27;Otu &#x27;Itu. Shortly after the Dutch visit, from 1724 until 1750, the &#x27;Otu &#x27;Itu fought the Tu&#x27;u for control of the island. This continued until the 1860s. Famine followed the burning of huts and the destruction of fields. Social control vanished as the ordered way of life gave way to lawlessness and predatory bands as the warrior class took over. Homelessness prevailed, with many living underground. After the Spanish visit, from 1770 onward, a period of statue toppling, &quot;huri mo&#x27;ai&quot;, commenced. This was an attempt by competing groups to destroy the socio-spiritual power, or &quot;mana&quot;, represented by statues, making sure to break them in the fall to ensure they were dead and without power. None were left standing by the time of the arrival of the French missionaries in the 1860s.

Between 1862 and 1888, about 94% of the population perished or emigrated. The island was victimized by blackbirding from 1862 to 1863, resulting in the abduction or killing of about 1,500, with 1,408 working as indentured servants in Peru. Only about a dozen eventually returned to Easter Island, but they brought smallpox, which decimated the remaining population of 1,500. Those who perished included the island&#x27;s &quot;tumu ivi &#x27;atua&quot;, bearers of the island&#x27;s culture, history, and genealogy besides the &quot;rongorongo&quot; experts.

===Rapa Nui settlement===
Estimated dates of initial settlement of Easter Island have ranged from 400 to 1300 CE. though the current best estimate for colonization is in the . Easter Island colonization likely coincided with the arrival of the first settlers in Hawaii. Rectifications in radiocarbon dating have changed almost all of the previously posited early settlement dates in Polynesia. Ongoing archaeological studies provide this late date: &quot;Radiocarbon dates for the earliest stratigraphic layers at Anakena, Easter Island, and analysis of previous radiocarbon dates imply that the island was colonized late, about . Significant ecological impacts and major cultural investments in monumental architecture and statuary thus began soon after initial settlement.&quot;

According to oral tradition, the first settlement was at Anakena. Researchers have noted that the Caleta Anakena landing point provides the island&#x27;s best shelter from prevailing swells as well as a sandy beach for canoe landings and launchings, so it is a likely early place of settlement. However, radiocarbon dating concludes that other sites preceded Anakena by many years, especially the Tahai by several centuries.

The island was populated by Polynesians who most likely navigated in canoes or catamarans from the Gambier Islands (Mangareva, away) or the Marquesas Islands, away. According to some theories, such as the Polynesian Diaspora Theory, there is a possibility that early Polynesian settlers arrived from South America due to their remarkable sea-navigation abilities. Theorists have supported this through the agricultural evidence of the sweet potato. The sweet potato was a favoured crop in Polynesian society for generations but it originated in South America, suggesting interaction between these two geographic areas. However, recent research suggests that sweet potatoes may have spread to Polynesia by long-distance dispersal long before the Polynesians arrived. When James Cook visited the island, one of his crew members, a Polynesian from Bora Bora, Hitihiti, was able to communicate with the Rapa Nui. It has been noted that the early jumping-off points for the early Polynesian colonization of Easter Island are more likely to have been from Mangareva, Pitcairn and Henderson, which lie about halfway between the Marquesas and Easter. It has been observed that there is great similarity with the Rapa Nui language and Early Mangarevan, similarities between a statue found in Pitcairn and some statues found in Easter Island, the resemblance of tool styles in Easter Island to those in Mangareva and Pitcairn, and correspondences of skulls found in Easter Island to two skulls found in Henderson, all suggesting Henderson and Pitcairn Islands to have been early stepping stones from Mangareva to Easter Island, which in 1999, a voyage with reconstructed Polynesian boats was able to reach Easter Island from Mangareva after a seventeen-and-a-half-day voyage.
According to oral traditions recorded by missionaries in the 1860s, the island originally had a strong class system: an &quot;ariki&quot;, or high chief, wielded great power over nine other clans and their respective chiefs. The high chief was the eldest descendant through first-born lines of the island&#x27;s legendary founder, Hotu Matu&#x27;a. The most visible element in the culture was the production of massive moai statues that some believe represented deified ancestors. According to &quot;National Geographic&quot;, &quot;Most scholars suspect that the moai were created to honor ancestors, chiefs, or other important personages, However, no written and little oral history exists on the island, so it&#x27;s impossible to be certain.&quot;

It was believed that the living had a symbiotic relationship with the dead in which the dead provided everything that the living needed (health, fertility of land and animals, fortune etc.) and the living, through offerings, provided the dead with a better place in the spirit world. Most settlements were located on the coast, and most moai were erected along the coastline, watching over their descendants in the settlements before them, with their backs toward the spirit world in the sea.

==== Ecocide hypothesis ====

In his book &quot;&quot;, Jared Diamond suggested that cannibalism took place on Easter Island after the construction of the moai contributed to environmental degradation when extreme deforestation (ecocide) destabilized an already precarious ecosystem. Archeological record shows that at the time of the initial settlement the island was home to many species of trees, including at least three species which grew up to or more: &quot;Paschalococos&quot; (possibly the largest palm trees in the world at the time), &quot;Alphitonia zizyphoides&quot;, and &quot;Elaeocarpus rarotongensis.&quot; At least six species of land birds were known to live on the island. A major factor that contributed to the extinction of multiple plant species was the introduction of the Polynesian rat. Studies by paleobotanists have shown rats can dramatically affect the reproduction of vegetation in an ecosystem. In the case of Rapa Nui, recovered plant seed shells showed markings of being gnawed on by rats. This version of the history speculates a high former population to the island that had already declined before Europeans arrived. Barbara A. West wrote, &quot;Sometime before the arrival of Europeans on Easter Island, the Rapanui experienced a tremendous upheaval in their social system brought about by a change in their island&#x27;s ecology... By the time of European arrival in 1722, the island&#x27;s population had dropped to 2,000–3,000 from a high of approximately 15,000 just a century earlier.&quot;
By that time, 21 species of trees and all species of land birds became extinct through some combination of over-harvesting, over-hunting, rat predation, and climate change. The island was largely deforested, and it did not have any trees taller than . Loss of large trees meant that residents were no longer able to build seaworthy vessels, significantly diminishing their fishing abilities. According to this version of the history, the trees were used as rollers to move the statues to their place of erection from the quarry at Rano Raraku. Deforestation also caused erosion which caused a sharp decline in agricultural production. This was exacerbated by the loss of land birds and the collapse in seabird populations as a source of food. By the 18th century, islanders were largely sustained by farming, with domestic chickens as the primary source of protein.
As the island became overpopulated and resources diminished, warriors known as &quot;matatoa&quot; gained more power and the Ancestor Cult ended, making way for the Bird Man Cult. Beverly Haun wrote, &quot;The concept of mana (power) invested in hereditary leaders was recast into the person of the birdman, apparently beginning circa 1540, and coinciding with the final vestiges of the moai period.&quot; This cult maintained that, although the ancestors still provided for their descendants, the medium through which the living could contact the dead was no longer statues but human beings chosen through a competition. The god responsible for creating humans, Makemake, played an important role in this process. Katherine Routledge, who systematically collected the island&#x27;s traditions in her 1919 expedition, showed that the competitions for Bird Man (Rapa Nui: &quot;tangata manu&quot;) started around 1760, after the arrival of the first Europeans, and ended in 1878, with the construction of the first church by Roman Catholic missionaries who formally arrived in 1864. Petroglyphs representing Bird Men on Easter Island are the same as some in Hawaii, indicating that this concept was probably brought by the original settlers; only the competition itself was unique to Easter Island. According to Diamond and Heyerdahl&#x27;s version of the island&#x27;s history, the &quot;huri mo&#x27;ai&quot;&quot;statue-toppling&quot;continued into the 1830s as a part of fierce internal wars. By 1838, the only standing moai were on the slopes of Rano Raraku, in Hoa Hakananai&#x27;a in Orongo, and Ariki Paro in Ahu Te Pito Kura.

==== Criticism of the ecocide hypothesis ====

Diamond and West&#x27;s version of the history is highly controversial. A study headed by Douglas Owsley published in 1994 asserted that there is little archaeological evidence of pre-European societal collapse. Bone pathology and osteometric data from islanders of that period clearly suggest few fatalities can be attributed directly to violence. Research by Binghamton University anthropologists Robert DiNapoli and Carl Lipo in 2021 suggests that the island experienced steady population growth from its initial settlement until European contact in 1722. The island never had more than a few thousand people prior to European contact, and their numbers were increasing rather than dwindling.

Several works that address or counter Diamond&#x27;s claims in &quot;Collapse&quot; have been published. In &quot;Ecological Catastrophe and Collapse -The Myth of &quot;Ecocide&quot; on Rapa Nui (Easter Island)&quot;, Hunt and Lipo set out a claim-by-claim rebuttal to Diamond&#x27;s claims. This includes, among other things, that deforestation began immediately, but the population grew while the forest declined as the land was converted to more productive farmland; that the island&#x27;s population grew continuously up to the arrival of Europeans, with the only clear decline starting in the period of 1750–1800; that studies from other islands show clearly that Polynesian settlement without Polynesian rats is only associated with minimal forest loss while the arrival of rats without human settlement is devastating to forest populations; only species favoured by the rats for consumption were lost, not for example the native &quot;Sophora toromiro&quot;; that the island&#x27;s drier, less predictable climate made it inherently more vulnerable to deforestation than other Polynesian islands; and that the population declines on Rapa Nui can be well attributed to the very mechanism described by Diamond in another of his books, &quot;Guns, Germs and Steel&quot; - the devastating impact of introduced diseases, raids, slavery, and exploitation on indigenous populations.

In another work, Hunt and Lipo discuss more evidence against the ecocide hypothesis. In addition to focusing on the settlement chronology, they note that the island has an abnormally low amount of evidence of warfare compared to other Polynesian islands, only relatively small-scale intergroup conflict. There are no fortifications, and the attributed obsidian mata&#x27;a &quot;weapons&quot; show rather evidence of having been used in agriculture, and indeed, match up with agricultural tools long recognized among artifacts of other Polynesian peoples. Evidence of violence among skeletal remains of pre-European native skeletons is minimal, with only 2.5% of crania showing evidence of antemortem fractures, consistent with Oswley&#x27;s conclusions: &quot;most skeletal injuries appear to have been nonlethal. Few fatalities were directly attributable to violence. The physical evidence suggests that the frequency of warfare and lethal events was exaggerated in folklore.&quot; Despite known folklore, Hunt and Lipo also conclude that clear evidence of cannibalism among skeletal remains is entirely lacking. They note that in the search for evidence supporting ecocide, the far more obvious answer has long been known, and cite Metraux as evidence that &quot;The historic slave-trading, epidemic disease, intensive sheep ranching, and tragic population collapse - indeed the genocide of the Rapanui People - is well documented, and has been recognized for a long time.&quot; They conclude that when it comes to the science, &quot;It does not matter whether Rapa Nui offers a parable for today&#x27;s urgent environmental problems.&quot;

In a 2010 metastudy on the state of the evidence, the Mulrooney et al. concludes that &quot;To date, there is no conclusive evidence for the proposed precontact collapse of Rapa Nui society&quot;. In particular, the authors note that the obsidian usage trends lead to entirely different, self-inconsistent interpretations, while use of the oral histories of widespread intertribal warfare is undercut not just by early foreign visitors referring to the people as peaceful and docile, but the fact that the very wars in question were referred to as &quot;the wars of the throwing down of the statues&quot;, an event well-dated to not have begun until after western contact.

===European contact===

The first recorded European contact with the island was on April 5, 1722, Easter Sunday, by Dutch navigator Jacob Roggeveen. His visit resulted in the death of about a dozen islanders, including the &quot;tumu ivi &#x27;atua&quot;, and the wounding of many others.

The next foreign visitors (on 15 November 1770) were two Spanish ships, &quot;San Lorenzo&quot; and &quot;Santa Rosalia&quot;, under the command of Captain Don Felipe Gonzalez de Ahedo. The Spanish were amazed by the &quot;standing idols&quot;, all of which were erect at the time.

In 1776 the Chilean priest Juan Ignacio Molina highlights the island for its &quot;monumental statues&quot; in the fifth chapter on &quot;Chilean Islands&quot; of his book &quot;Natural and Civil History of the Kingdom of Chile&quot;.

Four years later, in 1774, British explorer James Cook visited Easter Island; he reported that some statues had been toppled. Through the interpretation of Hitihiti, Cook learned the statues commemorated their former high chiefs, including their names and ranks.
On April 10, 1786, French Admiral Jean-François de Galaup, comte de Lapérouse anchored at Hanga Roa at the start of a circumnavigation of the Pacific. He made a detailed map of the bay, including his anchorage points, as well as a more generalised map of the island, plus some illustrations.

===19th century===
A series of devastating events killed or removed most of the population in the 1860s. In December 1862, Peruvian slave raiders struck. Violent abductions continued for several months, eventually capturing around 1,500 men and women, half of the island&#x27;s population. Among those captured were the island&#x27;s paramount chief, his heir, and those who knew how to read and write the rongorongo script, the only Polynesian script to have been found to date, although debate exists about whether this is proto-writing or true writing.

When the slave raiders were forced to repatriate the people they had kidnapped, carriers of smallpox disembarked together with a few survivors on each of the islands. This created devastating epidemics from Easter Island to the Marquesas islands. Easter Island&#x27;s population was reduced to the point where some of the dead were not even buried.
The first Christian missionary, Eugène Eyraud, arrived in January 1864 and spent most of that year on the island and reported for the first time the existence of the so-called rongo-rongo tablets; but mass conversion of the Rapa Nui only came after his return in 1866 with Father Hippolyte Roussel. Two other missionaries arrived with Captain Jean-Baptiste Dutrou-Bornier. Eyraud contracted tuberculosis during the 1867 island epidemic, which took a quarter of the island&#x27;s remaining population of 1,200, with only 930 Rapanui remaining. The dead included the last &quot;ariki mau&quot;, the last East Polynesia royal first-born son, the 13-year-old Manu Rangi. Eyraud died of tuberculosis in August 1868, by which time almost the entire Rapa Nui population had become Roman Catholic.

Tuberculosis, introduced by whalers in the mid-19th century, had already killed several islanders when Eugène Eyraud died from the disease in 1867. It ultimately resulted in the death of approximately a quarter of the island&#x27;s population. The managers of the sheep ranch and the missionaries started buying the newly available lands of the deceased in the years that followed, which led to large confrontations between natives and settlers.
Jean-Baptiste Dutrou-Bornier bought up all of the island apart from the missionaries&#x27; area around Hanga Roa and moved a few hundred Rapa Nui to Tahiti to work for his backers. In 1871 the missionaries, having fallen out with Dutrou-Bornier, evacuated all but 171 Rapa Nui to the Gambier islands. Those who remained were mostly older men. Six years later, only 111 people lived on Easter Island, and only 36 of them had any offspring. From that point on, the island&#x27;s population slowly recovered. But with over 97% of the population dead or gone in less than a decade, much of the island&#x27;s cultural knowledge had been lost.

Alexander Salmon, Jr., the son of an English Jewish merchant and a Pōmare Dynasty princess, eventually worked to repatriate workers from his inherited copra plantation. He eventually bought up all lands on the island with the exception of the mission, and was its sole employer. He worked to develop tourism on the island and was the principal informant for the British and German archaeological expeditions for the island. He sent several pieces of genuine Rongorongo to his niece&#x27;s husband, the German consul in Valparaíso, Chile. Salmon sold the Brander Easter Island holdings to the Chilean government on January 2, 1888, and signed as a witness to the cession of the island. He returned to Tahiti in December 1888. He effectively ruled the island from 1878 until his cession to Chile in 1888.
In 1887 Chile took concrete actions to incorporate the island into the national territory, at the request of the Chilean Navy Captain Policarpo Toro, who was concerned about the unprotected situation of the Rapa Nui for decades and began to influence the situation on his own initiative. Policarpo, through negotiations, bought land on the island at the request of the Bishop of Valparaiso, Salvador Donoso Rodriguez, owner of 600 hectares, together with the Salmon brothers, Dutrou-Bornier and John Brander, from Tahiti. The Chilean captain put money from his own pocket for this purpose, together with 6000 pounds sterling sent by the Chilean government. According to Rapa Nui tradition, the lands could not be sold, however, third parties believed they owned them and they were bought from them so that they would not interfere in the affairs of the island from that moment on.

At that time, the Rapa Nui population reached alarming numbers. In a census carried out by the Chilean corvette Abtao in 1892, there were only 101 Rapa Nui alive, of which only 12 were adult men. The Rapa Nui ethnic group, along with their culture, was at its closest point to extinction.

Then, on September 9, 1888, thanks to the efforts of the Bishop of Tahiti, Monsignor José María Verdier, the Agreement of Wills (&quot;Acuerdo de Voluntades&quot;) was signed, in which the local representative Atamu Tekena, head of the Council of Rapanui Chiefs ceded the sovereignty of the island to the State of Chile, represented by Policarpo Toro. The Rapa Nui elders ceded sovereignty, without renouncing their titles as chiefs, the ownership of their lands, the validity of their culture and traditions and on equal terms. The Rapa Nui sold nothing, they were integrated in equal conditions to Chile.

The annexation to Chile, together with the abolition of slavery in Peru, brought the advantage that foreign slavers did not take any more inhabitants from the island. However, in 1895, the &quot;Compañía Explotadora de Isla de Pascua&quot; from Enrique Merlet obtained the concession of the entire island after the failure of the State&#x27;s colonization plan following the Civil War of 1891 and the change of government in the country.
The company imposed prohibitions to live and work outside Hanga Roa and even forced labor of the islanders in the company, something that was avoided thanks to the &quot;safe-conducts&quot; given by the Navy that allowed the islanders to cross the entire island once the Navy took control of the island during the 20th Century.

In 1903 the island was bought by the English sheep-farming company Williamson Balfor from the Merlet company, and – no longer being able to farm for food – the natives were forced to work on the ranches in order to buy food.

===20th century===
In 1914 there was an uprising of the natives inspired by the elderly catechist María Angata Veri Veri and led by Daniel Maria Teave with the aim of getting the State to take charge of the situation generated by the company. The Navy held the company responsible for the &quot;brutal and savage acts&quot; committed by Merlet and the company&#x27;s administrators and an investigation was requested.
In 1916, the island was declared a subdelegation of the Department of Valparaíso. In the same year, Archbishop Rafael Edwards Salas visited the island and became the main spokesman for the natives&#x27; complaints and demands. However, the Chilean State decided to renew the lease to the company, under the figure of the so-called &quot;Provisional Temperament&quot;, distributing additional lands to the natives (5 ha per marriage as of 1926), allocating lands for the Chilean administration and establishing the permanent presence of the Navy, which in 1936 established a regulation according to which, with prior permission, the natives could leave Hanga Roa to fish or provide themselves with fuel.

Monsignor Rafael Edwards sought to have the island declared a &quot;naval jurisdiction&quot; in order to intervene in it as military vicar and in this way support the Rapa Nui community, creating better living conditions.

In 1933, the Chilean State Defense Council required the registration of the island in the name of the State in order to protect it from private individuals who wanted to register it in their own name.

Until the 1960s the Rapanui were confined to Hanga Roa. The rest of the island was rented to the Williamson-Balfour Company as a sheep farm until 1953 when President Carlos Ibáñez del Campo cancelled the company&#x27;s contract for non-compliance and then assigned the entire administration of the island to the Chilean Navy. The island was then managed by the Chilean Navy until 1966, at which point the island was reopened in its entirety. The Rapanui were given Chilean citizenship that year with the Pascua Law enacted during the government of Eduardo Frei Montalva. Only Spanish was taught in the schools until that year. The Law also created the Isla de Pascua commune depending from the Valparaíso Province and implemented the Civil Registry, created the positions of governor, mayor and councilman, as well as the 6th Police Station of Carabineros de Chile, the first fire company of Easter Island, schools and a hospital. The first mayor was sworn in 1966 and was Alfonso Rapu who sent a letter to President Frei two years prior influencing him to create the Pascua Law.

Islanders were only able to travel off the island easily after the construction of the Mataveri International Airport in 1965, which was built by the Longhi construction company, carrying hundreds of workers, heavy machinery, tents and a field hospital on ships. However, its use did not go beyond airline operations with small groups of tourists. At the same time, a NASA tracking station operated on the island, which ceased operations in 1975.

Between 1965 and 1970, the United States Air Force (USAF) settled on Easter Island, radically changing the way of life of the Rapa Nui, as they became acquainted with the customs of the consumer societies of the developed world.

In April 1967 LAN Chile flights began to land and the island began to be oriented towards cultural tourism. Since then, the main concerns for the natives were to strengthen production and marketing cooperatives, which received state support, and to recover their communal lands.
Following the 1973 Chilean coup d&#x27;état that brought Augusto Pinochet to power, Easter Island was placed under martial law. Tourism slowed down and private property was restored. During his time in power, Pinochet visited Easter Island on three occasions. The military built a number of new military facilities and a new city hall.

On January 24, 1975, television arrived on the island, with the inauguration of a station of Televisión Nacional de Chile, which broadcast programming on a delayed basis until 1996, when live satellite transmissions to the island began.

In 1976 the Isla de Pascua Province was created with Arnt Arentsen Pettersen appointed as the first governor between 1976 and 1979. Between 1984 and 1990 the administration of Governor Sergio Rapu Haoa stands out and since then all the governors have been Rapanui.

In 1979, Decree Law No. 2885 was enacted to grant individual land titles to regular holders.

On April 1, 1986, Law No. 18,502 is enacted, which establishes the special fuel subsidy in Easter Island, stating that it &quot;may not exceed in each product 3.5 monthly tax units per cubic meter, whose value may be paid directly or through the imputation of the respective amount to the payment of certain taxes&quot;.

As a result of an agreement in 1985 between Chile and the United States, the runway at Mataveri International Airport was extended by , reaching , and was re-opened in 1987. Pinochet is reported to have refused to attend the opening ceremony in protest against pressures from the United States to address human rights cases.

===21st century===

Fishers of Rapa Nui have shown their concern of illegal fishing on the island. &quot;Since the year 2000 we started to lose tuna, which is the basis of the fishing on the island, so then we began to take the fish from the shore to feed our families, but in less than two years we depleted all of it&quot;, Pakarati said. On 30 July 2007, a constitutional reform gave Easter Island and the Juan Fernández Islands (also known as Robinson Crusoe Island) the status of &quot;special territories&quot; of Chile. Pending the enactment of a special charter, the island continues to be governed as a province of the V Region of Valparaíso.

Species of fish were collected in Easter Island for one month in different habitats including shallow lava pools and deep waters. Within these habitats, two holotypes and paratypes, &quot;Antennarius randalli&quot; and &quot;Antennarius moai&quot;, were discovered. These are considered frog-fish because of their characteristics: &quot;12 dorsal rays, last two or three branched; bony part of first dorsal spine slightly shorter than second dorsal spine; body without bold zebra-like markings; caudal peduncle short, but distinct; last pelvic ray divided; pectoral rays 11 or 12&quot;.

In 2018, the government decided to limit the stay period for tourists from 90 to 30 days because of social and environmental issues faced by the Island to preserve its historical importance.

A tsunami warning was declared for Easter Island after the 2022 Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha&#x27;apai eruption and tsunami.

Easter Island was closed to tourists from March 17, 2020, until August 4, 2022, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Then in early October 2022, just two months after the island was reopened to tourists, a forest fire burned nearly of the island, causing irreparable damage to some of the &quot;moai&quot;. Arson is suspected.

===Indigenous rights movement===

Starting in August 2010, members of the indigenous Hitorangi clan occupied the Hangaroa Eco Village and Spa. The occupiers allege that the hotel was bought from the Pinochet government, in violation of a Chilean agreement with the indigenous Rapa Nui, in the 1990s. The occupiers say their ancestors had been cheated into giving up the land. According to a BBC report, on 3 December 2010, at least 25 people were injured when Chilean police using pellet guns attempted to evict from these buildings a group of Rapa Nui who had claimed that the land the buildings stood on had been illegally taken from their ancestors. In 2020 the conflict was settled. The property rights were transferred to the Hitorangi clan while the owners retained the exploitation of the hotel for 15 years.

In January 2011, the UN Special Rapporteur on Indigenous People, James Anaya, expressed concern about the treatment of the indigenous Rapa Nui by the Chilean government, urging Chile to &quot;make every effort to conduct a dialogue in good faith with representatives of the Rapa Nui people to solve, as soon as possible the real underlying problems that explain the current situation&quot;. The incident ended in February 2011, when up to 50 armed police broke into the hotel to remove the final five occupiers. They were arrested by the government, and no injuries were reported.

==Geography==

Easter Island is one of the world&#x27;s most isolated inhabited islands. Its closest inhabited neighbour is Pitcairn Island, to the west, with approximately 50 inhabitants. The nearest continental point lies in central Chile near Concepción, at . Easter Island&#x27;s latitude is similar to that of Caldera, Chile, and it lies west of continental Chile at its nearest point (between Lota and Lebu in the Biobío Region). Isla Salas y Gómez, to the east, is closer but is uninhabited. The Tristan da Cunha archipelago in the southern Atlantic competes for the title of the most remote island, lying from Saint Helena island and from the South African coast.

The island is about long by at its widest point; its overall shape is triangular. It has an area of , and a maximum elevation of above mean sea level. There are three &quot;Rano&quot; (freshwater crater lakes), at Rano Kau, Rano Raraku and Rano Aroi, near the summit of Terevaka, but no permanent streams or rivers.

===Geology===

Easter Island is a volcanic island, consisting mainly of three extinct coalesced volcanoes: Terevaka (altitude 507 metres) forms the bulk of the island, while two other volcanoes, Poike and Rano Kau, form the eastern and southern headlands and give the island its roughly triangular shape. Lesser cones and other volcanic features include the crater Rano Raraku, the cinder cone Puna Pau and many volcanic caves including lava tubes. Poike used to be a separate island until volcanic material from Terevaka united it to the larger whole. The island is dominated by hawaiite and basalt flows which are rich in iron and show affinity with igneous rocks found in the Galápagos Islands.
Easter Island and surrounding islets, such as Motu Nui and Motu Iti, form the summit of a large volcanic mountain rising over from the sea bed. The mountain is part of the Salas y Gómez Ridge, a (mostly submarine) mountain range with dozens of seamounts, formed by the Easter hotspot. The range begins with Pukao and next Moai, two seamounts to the west of Easter Island, and extends east to the Nazca Ridge. The ridge was formed by the Nazca Plate moving over the Easter hotspot.

Located about east of the East Pacific Rise, Easter Island lies within the Nazca Plate, bordering the Easter Microplate. The Nazca-Pacific relative plate movement due to the seafloor spreading, amounts to about per year. This movement over the Easter hotspot has resulted in the Easter Seamount Chain, which merges into the Nazca Ridge further to the east. Easter Island and Isla Salas y Gómez are surface representations of that chain. The chain has progressively younger ages to the west. The current hotspot location is speculated to be west of Easter Island, amidst the Ahu, Umu and Tupa submarine volcanic fields and the Pukao and Moai seamounts.

Easter Island lies atop the Rano Kau Ridge, and consists of three shield volcanoes with parallel geologic histories. Poike and Rano Kau exist on the east and south slopes of Terevaka, respectively. Rano Kau developed between 0.78 and 0.46 Ma from tholeiitic to alkalic basalts. This volcano possesses a clearly defined summit caldera. Benmoreitic lavas extruded about the rim from 0.35 to 0.34 Ma. Finally, between 0.24 and 0.11 Ma, a fissure developed along a NE–SW trend, forming monogenetic vents and rhyolitic intrusions. These include the cryptodome islets of Motu Nui and Motu Iti, the islet of Motu Kao Kao, the sheet intrusion of Te Kari Kari, the perlitic obsidian Te Manavai dome and the Maunga Orito dome.

Poike formed from tholeiitic to alkali basalts from 0.78 to 0.41 Ma. Its summit collapsed into a caldera which was subsequently filled by the Puakatiki lava cone pahoehoe flows at 0.36 Ma. Finally, the trachytic lava domes of Maunga Vai a Heva, Maunga Tea Tea, and Maunga Parehe formed along a NE-SW trending fissure.

Terevaka formed around 0.77 Ma of tholeiitic to alkali basalts, followed by the collapse of its summit into a caldera. Then at about 0.3Ma, cinder cones formed along a NNE-SSW trend on the western rim, while porphyritic benmoreitic lava filled the caldera, and pahoehoe flowed towards the northern coast, forming lava tubes, and to the southeast. Lava domes and a vent complex formed in the Maunga Puka area, while breccias formed along the vents on the western portion of Rano Aroi crater. This volcano&#x27;s southern and southeastern flanks are composed of younger flows consisting of basalt, alkali basalt, hawaiite, mugearite, and benmoreite from eruptive fissures starting at 0.24 Ma. The youngest lava flow, Roiho, is dated at 0.11 Ma. The Hanga O Teo embayment is interpreted to be a 200 m high landslide scarp.

Rano Raraku and Maunga Toa Toa are isolated tuff cones of about 0.21 Ma. The crater of Rano Raraku contains a freshwater lake. The stratified tuff is composed of sideromelane, slightly altered to palagonite, and somewhat lithified. The tuff contains lithic fragments of older lava flows. The northwest sector of Rano Raraku contains reddish volcanic ash. According to Bandy, &quot;...all of the great images of Easter Island are carved from&quot; the light and porous tuff from Rano Raraku. A carving was abandoned when a large, dense and hard lithic fragment was encountered. However, these lithics became the basis for stone hammers and chisels. The Puna Pau crater contains an extremely porous pumice, from which was carved the Pukao &quot;hats&quot;. The Maunga Orito obsidian was used to make the &quot;mataa&quot; spearheads.

In the first half of the 20th century, steam reportedly came out of the Rano Kau crater wall. This was photographed by the island&#x27;s manager, Mr. Edmunds.

The ancient Easter Island residents captured fresh groundwater where it seeped into the sea.&lt;ref name=&quot;sciencedaily/210921091735&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;10.3390/rs13132531&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;orb.binghamton.edu/1041&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;researchgate.net/334000200&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
Under the Köppen climate classification, the climate of Easter Island is classified as a tropical rainforest climate (&quot;Af&quot;) that borders on a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;). The lowest temperatures are recorded in July and August (minimum ) and the highest in February (maximum temperature ), the summer season in the southern hemisphere. Winters are relatively mild. The rainiest month is May, though the island experiences year-round rainfall. Easter Island&#x27;s isolated location exposes it to winds which help to keep the temperature fairly cool. Precipitation averages per year. Occasionally, heavy rainfall and rainstorms strike the island. These occur mostly in the winter months (June–August). Since it is close to the South Pacific High and outside the range of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, cyclones and hurricanes do not occur around Easter Island. There is significant temperature moderation due to its isolated position in the middle of the ocean.

==Ecology==
Easter Island, together with its closest neighbour, the tiny island of Isla Salas y Gómez farther east, is recognized by ecologists as a distinct ecoregion, the Rapa Nui tropical broadleaf forests. The original tropical moist broadleaf forests are now gone, but paleobotanical studies of fossil pollen, tree moulds left by lava flows, and root casts found in local soils indicate that the island was formerly forested, with a range of trees, shrubs, ferns, and grasses. A large extinct palm, &quot;Paschalococos disperta&quot;, related to the Chilean wine palm (&quot;Jubaea chilensis&quot;), was one of the dominant trees as attested by fossil evidence. Like its Chilean counterpart it probably took close to 100 years to reach adult height. The Polynesian rat, which the original settlers brought with them, played a very important role in the disappearance of the Rapa Nui palm. Although some may believe that rats played a major role in the degradation of the forest, less than 10% of palm nuts show teeth marks from rats. The remains of palm stumps in different places indicate that humans caused the trees to fall because in large areas, the stumps were cut efficiently.

The loss of the palms to make the settlements led to their extinction almost 350 years ago. The toromiro tree &quot;(Sophora toromiro)&quot; was prehistorically present on Easter Island, but is now extinct in the wild. However, the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew and the Göteborg Botanical Garden are jointly leading a scientific program to reintroduce the toromiro to Easter Island. With the palm and the toromiro virtually gone, there was considerably less rainfall as a result of less condensation. After the island was used to feed thousands of sheep for almost a century, by the mid-1900s the island was mostly covered in grassland with &quot;nga&#x27;atu&quot; or bulrush (&quot;Schoenoplectus californicus tatora&quot;) in the crater lakes of Rano Raraku and Rano Kau. The presence of these reeds, which are called &quot;totora&quot; in the Andes, was used to support the argument of a South American origin of the statue builders, but pollen analysis of lake sediments shows these reeds have grown on the island for over 30,000 years. Before the arrival of humans, Easter Island had vast seabird colonies containing probably over 30 resident species, perhaps the world&#x27;s richest. Such colonies are no longer found on the main island. Fossil evidence indicates six species of land birds (two rails, two parrots, one owl, and one heron), all of which have become extinct. Five introduced species of land bird are known to have breeding populations (see List of birds of Easter Island).

Lack of studies results in poor understanding of the oceanic fauna of Easter Island and waters in its vicinity; however, possibilities of undiscovered breeding grounds for humpback, southern blue and pygmy blue whales including Easter Island and Isla Salas y Gómez have been considered. Potential breeding areas for fin whales have been detected off northeast of the island as well.

The immunosuppressant drug sirolimus was first discovered in the bacterium &quot;Streptomyces hygroscopicus&quot; in a soil sample from Easter Island. The drug is also known as rapamycin, after Rapa Nui. It is now being studied for extending longevity in mice.
Trees are sparse, rarely forming natural groves, and it has been argued whether native Easter Islanders deforested the island in the process of erecting their statues, and in providing sustenance for an overconsumption of natural resources from a overcrowded island. Experimental archaeology demonstrated that some statues certainly could have been placed on Y-shaped wooden frames called &quot;miro manga erua&quot; and then pulled to their final destinations on ceremonial sites. Other theories involve the use of &quot;ladders&quot; (parallel wooden rails) over which the statues could have been dragged. Rapa Nui traditions metaphorically refer to spiritual power &quot;(mana)&quot; as the means by which the moai were &quot;walked&quot; from the quarry. Recent experimental recreations have proven that it is fully possible that the moai were literally walked from their quarries to their final positions by use of ropes, casting doubt on the role that their existence plays in the environmental collapse of the island.

Given the island&#x27;s southern latitude, the climatic effects of the Little Ice Age (about 1650 to 1850) may have exacerbated deforestation, although this remains speculative. Many researchers point to the climatic downtrend caused by the Little Ice Age as a contributing factor to resource stress and to the palm tree&#x27;s disappearance. Experts, however, do not agree on when the island&#x27;s palms became extinct.

Jared Diamond dismisses past climate change as a dominant cause of the island&#x27;s deforestation in his book &quot;Collapse&quot; which assesses the collapse of the ancient Easter Islanders. Influenced by Heyerdahl&#x27;s romantic interpretation of Easter&#x27;s history, Diamond insists that the disappearance of the island&#x27;s trees seems to coincide with a decline of its civilization around the 17th and 18th centuries, alongside declines of fish bones in middens (suggesting a decline in fishing) and then declines in bird bones, which he attributes to habitat loss. He notes that they stopped making statues at that time and started destroying the ahu. But the link is weakened because the Bird Man cult continued to thrive and survived the great impact caused by the arrival of explorers, whalers, sandalwood traders, and slave raiders.

Benny Peiser noted evidence of self-sufficiency when Europeans first arrived. The island still had smaller trees, mainly toromiro, which became extinct in the wild in the 20th century probably because of slow growth and changes in the island&#x27;s ecosystem. Cornelis Bouman, Jakob Roggeveen&#x27;s captain, stated in his logbook, &quot;... of yams, bananas and small coconut palms we saw little and no other trees or crops.&quot; According to Carl Friedrich Behrens, Roggeveen&#x27;s officer, &quot;The natives presented palm branches as peace offerings.&quot; According to ethnographer Alfred Mètraux, the most common type of house was called &quot;hare paenga&quot; (and is known today as &quot;boathouse&quot;) because the roof resembled an overturned boat. The foundations of the houses were made of buried basalt slabs with holes for wooden beams to connect with each other throughout the width of the house. These were then covered with a layer of totora reed, followed by a layer of woven sugarcane leaves, and lastly a layer of woven grass.

Peiser claims that these reports indicate that large trees existed at that time, which is perhaps contradicted by the Bouman quote above. Plantations were often located farther inland, next to foothills, inside open-ceiling lava tubes, and in other places protected from the strong salt winds and salt spray affecting areas closer to the coast. It is possible many of the Europeans did not venture inland. The statue quarry, only from the coast with an impressive cliff high, was not explored by Europeans until well into the 19th century.

Easter Island has suffered from heavy soil erosion in recent centuries, aggravated by massive historic deforestation alongside modern sheep farming throughout most of the 20th century. Jakob Roggeveen reported that Easter Island was exceptionally fertile. &quot;Fowls are the only animals they keep. They cultivate bananas, sugar cane, and above all sweet potatoes.&quot; In 1786 Jean-François de La Pérouse visited Easter Island and his gardener declared that &quot;three days&#x27; work a year&quot; would be enough to support the population. Rollin, a major in the Pérouse expedition, wrote, &quot;Instead of meeting with men exhausted by famine... I found, on the contrary, a considerable population, with more beauty and grace than I afterwards met in any other island; and a soil, which, with very little labor, furnished excellent provisions, and in an abundance more than sufficient for the consumption of the inhabitants.&quot; The islanders&#x27; innovation of lithic mulching - the practice of covering fields with gravel or rocks to trap moisture and improve soil fertility - is a well-known and effective practice in dry areas of the premodern world.

According to Diamond, the oral traditions (the veracity of which has been questioned by Routledge, Lavachery, Mètraux, Peiser, and others) of the current islanders seem obsessed with cannibalism, which he offers as evidence supporting a rapid collapse. For example, he states, to severely insult an enemy one would say, &quot;The flesh of your mother sticks between my teeth.&quot; This, Diamond asserts, means the food supply of the people ultimately ran out. Cannibalism, however, was widespread across Polynesian cultures. Human bones have not been found in earth ovens other than those behind the religious platforms, indicating that cannibalism in Easter Island was a ritualistic practice. Contemporary ethnographic research has proven there is scarcely any tangible evidence for widespread cannibalism anywhere and at any time on the island. The first scientific exploration of Easter Island (1914) recorded that the indigenous population strongly rejected allegations that they or their ancestors had been cannibals.

==Culture==
===Mythology===

The most important myths are:
* Tangata manu, the Birdman cult which was practised until the 1860s.
* Makemake, an important god.
* Aku-aku, the guardians of the sacred family caves.
* Moai-kava-kava a ghost man of the Hanau epe (long-ears.)
* Hekai ite umu pare haonga takapu Hanau epe kai noruego, the sacred chant to appease the aku-aku before entering a family cave.

===Stone work===
The Rapa Nui people had a Stone Age culture and made extensive use of local stone:
* Basalt, a hard, dense stone used for toki and at least one of the moai.
* Obsidian, a volcanic glass with sharp edges used for sharp-edged implements such as Mataa and for the black pupils of the eyes of the moai.
* Red scoria from Puna Pau, a very light red stone used for the pukao and a few moai.
* Tuff from Rano Raraku, a much more easily worked rock than basalt that was used for most of the moai.

====Moai (statues) ====
The large stone statues, or &quot;moai&quot;, for which Easter Island is famous, were carved in the period 1100–1680 CE (rectified radio-carbon dates). A total of 887 monolithic stone statues have been inventoried on the island and in museum collections. Although often identified as &quot;Easter Island heads&quot;, the statues have torsos, most of them ending at the top of the thighs; a small number are complete figures that kneel on bent knees with their hands over their stomachs. Some upright moai have become buried up to their necks by shifting soils.

Almost all (95%) moai were carved from compressed, easily worked solidified volcanic ash or tuff, found at a single site on the side of the extinct volcano Rano Raraku. The native islanders who carved them used only stone hand chisels, mainly basalt &quot;toki&quot;, which lie in place all over the quarry. The stone chisels were sharpened by chipping off a new edge when dulled. While sculpting was going on, the volcanic stone was splashed with water to soften it. While many teams worked on different statues at the same time, a single moai took a team of five or six men approximately a year to complete. Each statue represented the deceased head of a lineage.

Only a quarter of the statues were installed. Nearly half remained in the quarry at Rano Raraku, and the rest sat elsewhere, presumably on their way to intended locations. The largest moai raised on a platform is known as &quot;Paro&quot;. It weighs and is long. Several other statues of similar weight were transported to ahu on the north and south coasts.

Possible means by which the statues were moved include employment of a &quot;miro manga erua&quot;, a Y-shaped sledge with cross pieces, pulled with ropes made from the tough bark of the hau tree and tied around the statue&#x27;s neck. Anywhere from 180 to 250 men were required for pulling, depending on the size of the moai. Among other researchers on moving and erecting the moai was Vince Lee, who reenacted a moai moving scenario. Some 50 of the statues were re-erected in modern times. One of the first was on Ahu Ature Huke in Anakena beach in 1956. It was raised using traditional methods during a Heyerdahl expedition.

Another method that might have been used to transport the moai would be to attach ropes to the statue and rock it, tugging it forward as it rocked. This would fit the legend of the Mo&#x27;ai &#x27;walking&#x27; to their final locations. This might have been managed by as few as 15 people, supported by the following evidence:
* The heads of the moai in the quarry are sloped forward, whereas the ones moved to final locations are not. This would serve to provide a better centre of gravity for transport.
* The statues found along the transport roads have wider bases than statues installed on ahu; this would facilitate more stable transport. Studies have shown fractures along the bases of the statues in transport; these could have arisen from rocking the statue back and forth and placing great pressures on the edges. The statues found mounted on ahu do not have wide bases, and stone chips found at the sites suggest they were further modified on placement.
* The abandoned and fallen statues near the old roads are found (more often than would be expected from chance) face down on ascending grades and on their backs when headed uphill. Some were documented standing upright along the old roads, e.g., by a party from Captain Cook&#x27;s voyage that rested in the shade of a standing statue. This would be consistent with upright transport.

There is debate regarding the effects of the monument creation process on the environment. Some believe that the process of creating the moai caused widespread deforestation and ultimately a civil war over scarce resources.

In 2011, a large moai statue was excavated from the ground. During the same excavation program, some larger moai were found to have complex dorsal petroglyphs, revealed by deep excavation of the torso.

In 2020, a pickup truck crashed into and destroyed a moai statue due to brake failure. No one was injured in the incident.


====Ahu (stone platforms)====
&quot;Ahu&quot; are stone platforms. Varying greatly in layout, many were reworked during or after the &quot;huri mo&#x27;ai&quot; or &quot;statue-toppling&quot; era; many became ossuaries, one was dynamited open, and Ahu Tongariki was swept inland by a tsunami. Of the 313 known ahu, 125 carried moaiusually just one, probably because of the shortness of the moai period and transportation difficulties. Ahu Tongariki, from Rano Raraku, had the most and tallest moai, 15 in total. Other notable ahu with moai are Ahu Akivi, restored in 1960 by William Mulloy, Nau Nau at Anakena and Tahai. Some moai may have been made from wood and were lost.

The classic elements of ahu design are:
* A retaining rear wall several feet high, usually facing the sea
* A front wall made of rectangular basalt slabs called &quot;paenga&quot;
* A fascia made of red scoria that went over the front wall (platforms built after 1300)
* A sloping ramp in the inland part of the platform, extending outward like wings
* A pavement of even-sized, round water-worn stones called &quot;poro&quot;
* An alignment of stones before the ramp
* A paved plaza before the ahu. This was called &quot;marae&quot;
* Inside the ahu was a fill of rubble.

On top of many ahu would have been:
* Moai on squarish &quot;pedestals&quot; looking inland, the ramp with the poro before them.
* Pukao or Hau Hiti Rau on the moai heads (platforms built after 1300).
* When a ceremony took place, &quot;eyes&quot; were placed on the statues. The whites of the eyes were made of coral, the iris was made of obsidian or red scoria.

Ahu evolved from the traditional Polynesian &quot;marae&quot;. In this context, &quot;ahu&quot; referred to a small structure sometimes covered with a thatched roof where sacred objects, including statues, were stored. The ahu were usually adjacent to the marae or main central court where ceremonies took place, though on Easter Island, ahu and moai evolved to much greater size. There the marae is the unpaved plaza before the ahu. The biggest ahu is and holds 15 statues, some of which are high. The filling of an ahu was sourced locally (apart from broken, old moai, fragments of which have been used in the fill). Individual stones are mostly far smaller than the moai, so less work was needed to transport the raw material, but artificially leveling the terrain for the plaza and filling the ahu was laborious.

Ahu are found mostly on the coast, where they are distributed densely and fairly evenly. The exceptions are the western slopes of Mount Terevaka and the Rano Kau and Poike headlands, where they are much sparser. These are the three areas with the least low-lying coastal land and, apart from Poike, the furthest areas from Rano Raraku. One ahu with several moai was recorded on the cliffs at Rano Kau in the 1880s but had fallen to the beach before the Routledge expedition. At least three recorded on Poike in the 1930s have also since disappeared.
====Stone walls====
One of the highest-quality examples of Easter Island stone masonry is the rear wall of the ahu at Vinapu. Made without mortar by shaping hard basalt rocks of up to to match each other exactly, it has a superficial similarity to some Inca stone walls in South America.

====Stone houses====

Two types of houses are known from the past: &quot;hare paenga&quot;, a house with an elliptical foundation, made with basalt slabs and covered with a thatched roof that resembled an overturned boat, and &quot;hare oka&quot;, a round stone structure. Related stone structures called &quot;Tupa&quot; look very similar to the &quot;hare oka&quot;, except that the &quot;Tupa&quot; were inhabited by astronomer-priests and located near the coast, where the movements of the stars could be easily observed. Settlements also contain &quot;hare moa&quot; (&quot;chicken house&quot;), oblong stone structures that housed chickens. The houses at the ceremonial village of Orongo are unique in that they are shaped like &quot;hare paenga&quot; but are made entirely of flat basalt slabs found inside Rano Kao crater. The entrances to all the houses are very low, and entry requires crawling.

In early times the people of Rapa Nui reportedly sent the dead out to sea in small funerary canoes, as did their Polynesian counterparts on other islands. They later started burying people in secret caves to save the bones from desecration by enemies. During the turmoil of the late 18th century, the islanders seem to have started to bury their dead in the space between the belly of a fallen moai and the front wall of the structure. During the time of the epidemics they made mass graves that were semi-pyramidal stone structures.

====Petroglyphs====
Easter Island has one of the richest collections of petroglyphs in all Polynesia. Around 1,000 sites with more than 4,000 petroglyphs are catalogued. Designs and images were carved out of rock for a variety of reasons: to create totems, to mark territory, or to memorialize a person or event. There are distinct variations around the island in the frequency of themes among petroglyphs, with a concentration of Birdmen at Orongo. Other subjects include sea turtles, Komari (vulvas) and Makemake, the chief god of the &quot;Tangata manu&quot; or Birdman cult.
====Caves====
The island and neighbouring Motu Nui are riddled with caves, many of which show signs of past human use for planting and as fortifications, including narrowed entrances and crawl spaces with ambush points. Many caves feature in the myths and legends of the Rapa Nui.

==== Stone aerophone ====
The &quot;Pu o Hiro&quot; (&quot;Trumpet of Hiro)&quot; is a high ancient stone aerophone on the north coast of Easter Island. It was once used by the Rapa Nui as a musical instrument in fertility rituals. The stone is covered in petroglyphs called &quot;komari&quot; which represent fertility. By skillfully blowing wind in the top hole it makes a deep, trumpeting sound to invoke the god of rain Hiro in Polynesian mythology.
===Rongorongo===

Easter Island once had an apparent script called &quot;rongorongo&quot;. Glyphs include pictographic and geometric shapes; the texts were incised in wood in reverse boustrophedon direction. It was first reported by French missionary Eugène Eyraud in 1864. At that time, several islanders said they could understand the writing, but according to tradition, only ruling families and priests were ever literate, and none survived the slave raids and subsequent epidemics. Despite numerous attempts, the surviving texts have not been deciphered, and without decipherment it is not certain that they are actually writing. Part of the problem is the small amount that has survived: only two dozen texts, none of which remain on the island. There are also only a couple of similarities with the petroglyphs on the island.
===Wood carving===
Wood was scarce on Easter Island during the 18th and 19th centuries, but a number of highly detailed and distinctive carvings have found their way to the world&#x27;s museums. Particular forms include:

* Reimiro, a gorget or breast ornament of crescent shape with a head at one or both tips. The same design appears on the flag of Rapa Nui. Two Rei Miru at the British Museum are inscribed with Rongorongo.
* Moko Miro, a man with a lizard head. The Moko Miro was used as a club because of the legs, which formed a handle shape. If it was not held by hand, dancers wore it around their necks during feasts. The Moko Miro would also be placed at the doorway to protect the household from harm. It would be hanging from the roof or set in the ground. The original form had eyes made from white shells, and the pupils were made of obsidian.
* Moai kavakava are male carvings and the Moai Paepae are female carvings. These grotesque and highly detailed human figures, carved from Toromiro pine, represent ancestors. Sometimes these statues were used for fertility rites. Usually, they are used for harvest celebrations; &quot;the first picking of fruits was heaped around them as offerings&quot;. When the statues were not used, they would be wrapped in bark cloth and kept at home. There were a few times that are reported when the islanders would pick up the figures like dolls and dance with them. The earlier figures are rare and generally depict a male figure with an emaciated body and a goatee. The figures&#x27; ribs and vertebrae are exposed and many examples show carved glyphs on various parts of the body but more specifically, on the top of the head. The female figures, rarer than the males, depict the body as flat and often with the female&#x27;s hand lying across the body. The figures, although some were quite large, were worn as ornamental pieces around a tribesman&#x27;s neck. The more figures worn, the more important the man. The figures have a shiny patina developed from constant handling and contact with human skin.
* Ao, a large dancing paddle

===21st-century culture===
The Rapanui sponsor an annual festival, the &quot;Tapati&quot;, held since 1975 around the beginning of February to celebrate Rapa Nui culture. The islanders also maintain a national football team and three discos in the town of Hanga Roa. Other cultural activities include a musical tradition that combines South American and Polynesian influences and woodcarving.

====Sports====
The Chilean leg of the Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series takes place on the Island of Rapa Nui.

=== Tapati Festival ===
Tapati Rapa Nui festival (&quot;week festival&quot; in the local language) is an annual two-week long festival celebrating Easter Island culture. The Tapati is centered around a competition between two families/ clans competing in various competitions to earn points. The winning team has their candidate crowned &#x27;queen&#x27; of the island for the next year. The competitions are a way to maintain and celebrate traditional cultural activities such as cooking, jewelry-making, woodcarving, and canoeing.

==Demographics==
===2012 census===
Population at the 2012 census was 5,761 (increased from 3,791 in 2002). In 2002, 60% were persons of indigenous Rapa Nui origin, 39% were mainland Chileans (or their Easter Island-born descendants) of European (mostly Spanish) or mestizo (mixed European and indigenous Chilean Amerindian) origin and Easter Island-born mestizos of European and Rapa Nui and/or native Chilean descent, and the remaining 1% were indigenous mainland Chilean Amerindians (or their Easter Island-born descendants). , the population density on Easter Island was .

===Demographic history===
The 1982 population was 1,936. The increase in population in the last census was partly caused by the arrival of people of European or mixed European and Native American descent from the Chilean mainland. However, most married a Rapa Nui spouse. Around 70% of the population were natives. Estimates of the pre-European population range from 7–17,000. Easter Island&#x27;s all-time low of 111 inhabitants was reported in 1877. Out of these 111 Rapa Nui, only 36 had descendants, and all of today&#x27;s Rapa Nui claim descent from those 36.

===Languages===
Easter Island&#x27;s traditional language is Rapa Nui, an Eastern Polynesian language, sharing some similarities with Hawaiian and Tahitian. However, as in the rest of mainland Chile, the official language used is Spanish. Easter Island is the only territory in Polynesia where Spanish is an official language.

It is supposed that the 2,700 indigenous Rapa Nui living in the island have a certain degree of knowledge of their traditional language; however, census data does not exist on the primary known and spoken languages among Easter Island&#x27;s inhabitants and there are recent claims that the number of fluent speakers is as low as 800. Indeed, Rapa Nui has been declining in its number of speakers as the island undergoes Hispanicization, because the island is under the jurisdiction of Chile and is now home to a number of Chilean continentals, most of whom speak only Spanish. For this reason, most Rapa Nui children now grow up speaking Spanish, and those who do learn Rapa Nui begin learning it later in life. Even with efforts to revitalize the language, Ethnologue has established that Rapa Nui is currently a threatened language.

Easter Island&#x27;s indigenous Rapa Nui toponymy has survived with few Spanish additions or replacements, a fact that has been attributed in part to the survival of the Rapa Nui language.

==Administration and legal status==

Easter Island shares with Juan Fernández Islands the constitutional status of &quot;special territory&quot; of Chile, granted in 2007. a special charter for the island was under discussion in the Chilean Congress.

Administratively, the island is a province (Isla de Pascua Province) of the Valparaíso Region and contains a single commune (&quot;comuna&quot;) (Isla de Pascua). Both the province and the commune are called &quot;Isla de Pascua&quot; and encompass the whole island and its surrounding islets and rocks, plus Isla Salas y Gómez, some to the east. The provincial governor is appointed by the President of the Republic. The municipal administration is located in Hanga Roa, led by a mayor and a six-member municipal council, all directly elected for a four-year mandate.

In August 2018, a law took effect prohibiting non-residents from staying on the island for more than 30 days.

Since 1966 rape, sexual abuse and crimes against property in Easter Island had lower sentences than corresponding offences in mainland Chile. This law was repealled in 2021 by a Constitutional Court decree.

<text>Philip Cortelyou Johnson (July 8, 1906 – January 25, 2005) was an American architect who designed modern and postmodern architecture. Among his best-known designs are his modernist Glass House in New Canaan, Connecticut; the postmodern 550 Madison Avenue in New York City, designed for AT&amp;T; 190 South La Salle Street in Chicago; IDS Tower in downtown Minneapolis; the Sculpture Garden of New York City&#x27;s Museum of Modern Art; and the Pre-Columbian Pavilion at Dumbarton Oaks. His January 2005 obituary in &quot;The New York Times&quot; described his works as being &quot;widely considered among the architectural masterpieces of the 20th century&quot;.

In 1930, Johnson became the first director of the architecture department of the Museum of Modern Art in New York. There he arranged for visits by Walter Gropius and Le Corbusier and negotiated the first American commission for Mies van der Rohe, after he fled Nazi Germany. In 1932, he organized with Henry-Russell Hitchcock the first exhibition dedicated to modern architecture at the Museum of Modern Art, which gave name to the subsequent movement known as International Style. In 1934, Johnson resigned his position at the museum.

During the 1930s, Johnson became an ardent admirer of Adolf Hitler, openly praised the Nazi Party, and espoused antisemitic views. He wrote for &quot;Social Justice&quot; and &quot;Examiner&quot;, where he published an admiring review of Hitler&#x27;s &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;. In 1939, as a correspondent for &quot;Social Justice&quot;, he witnessed Hitler&#x27;s invasion of Poland, which he later described as &quot;a stirring spectacle&quot;. In 1941, after the U.S. entered the war, Johnson abruptly renounced his earlier views, quit journalism, organizing anti-Fascist league at Harvard Design School. He was investigated by the FBI, and was eventually cleared for military service. He evaded indictment and jail by cooperating with the prosecution, though, according to some critics, it may have been because of his social connections, but no evidence of this was ever produced. Years later he would refer to these activities as &quot;the stupidest thing I ever did[which] I never can atone for&quot;.

In 1978, he was awarded an American Institute of Architects Gold Medal. In 1979, he was the first recipient of the Pritzker Architecture Prize. Today his skyscrapers are prominent features in the skylines of New York, Houston, Chicago, Detroit, Minneapolis, Pittsburgh, Atlanta, Madrid, and other cities.

== Early life and career ==

Johnson was born in Cleveland, Ohio, on July 8, 1906, the son of a lawyer, Homer Hosea Johnson (1862–1960), and the former Louisa Osborn Pope (1869–1957), a niece of Alfred Atmore Pope and a first cousin of Theodate Pope Riddle. He had an older sister, Jeannette, and a younger sister, Theodate. He was descended from the Jansen family of New Amsterdam. His ancestors include the Huguenot Jacques Cortelyou, who laid out the first town plan of New Amsterdam for Peter Stuyvesant. He grew up in New London, Ohio. He had a stutter and was diagnosed with cyclothymia. He attended the Hackley School in Tarrytown, New York, then studied as an undergraduate at Harvard University where he focused on learning Greek, philology, history and philosophy, particularly the work of the Pre-Socratic philosophers.

Upon completing his studies in 1930, he made a series of trips to Europe, particularly Germany, where his family had a summer house. He visited the landmarks of classical and Gothic architecture, and joined Henry-Russell Hitchcock, a prominent architectural historian, who was introducing Americans to the work of Le Corbusier, Walter Gropius, and other modernists. In 1928, he met German architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, who was at the time designing the German Pavilion for the 1929 Barcelona International Exposition. The meeting formed the basis for a lifelong relationship of both collaboration and competition.

Johnson had a substantial fortune, largely due to his father&#x27;s successful investment in Alcoa, the Aluminum Company of America. With this fortune, in 1930 he financed the new architecture department of the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and in 1932 he was named its curator. As curator he arranged for American visits by Gropius and Le Corbusier, and negotiated the first American commission for Mies van der Rohe. In 1932, working with Hitchcock and Alfred H. Barr, Jr., he organized the first exhibition on Modern architecture at the Museum of Modern Art. The show and their simultaneously published book &quot;International Style: Modern Architecture Since 1922&quot;, published in 1932, played a seminal role in introducing modern architecture to the American public.

When the rise of the Nazis in Germany forced the modernists Marcel Breuer and Mies van der Rohe to leave Germany, Johnson helped arrange for them to come to work in the United States. He created a small organization called the Gray Shirts, styled after the Nazi Brownshirts.

=== Politics and journalism ===
In December 1934, Johnson abruptly left the Museum of Modern Art and began pursuing a career in journalism and politics. He first became a supporter of Huey Long, the populist governor of Louisiana. He tried and failed to recruit Long to join the National Party, which he founded. Johnson unsuccessfully ran for representative of New London in the Ohio state legislature. After Long was assassinated in 1935, Johnson became a correspondent for &quot;Social Justice&quot;, the newspaper of the radical-populist and anti-Semitic Father Charles Coughlin. Johnson traveled to Germany and Poland as a correspondent, where he wrote admiringly about the Nazis.

In &quot;Social Justice&quot;, Johnson expressed, as &quot;The New York Times&quot; later reported, &quot;more than passing admiration for Hitler&quot;. In the summer of 1932 Johnson attended one of the Nuremberg Rallies in Germany and saw Hitler for the first time. Years later he would describe the event to his biographer, Franz Schulze: &quot;You simply could not fail to be caught up in the excitement of it, by the marching songs, by the crescendo and climax of the whole thing, as Hitler came on at last to harangue the crowd&quot;. He told of being thrilled at the sight of &quot;all those blond boys in black leather&quot; marching past the Führer. Sponsored by the German government, he traveled on a press tour which covered the invasion of Poland in 1939. Schulze dismissed these early political activities as inconsequential, concluding they merited &quot;little more substantial attention than they have gained&quot; and his politics &quot;were driven as much by an unconquerable esthetic impulse as by fascist philosophy or playboy adventurism&quot;.

=== Architecture school and Army service ===
In 1941, at the age of 35, Johnson abandoned politics and journalism and enrolled in the Harvard Graduate School of Design, where he studied with Marcel Breuer and Walter Gropius, who had recently fled from Nazi Germany. In 1941, Johnson designed and built his first building, a house at 9 Ash Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The house, strongly influenced by Mies van der Rohe, has a wall around the lot which merges with the structure. It was used by Johnson to host social events and was eventually submitted as his graduate thesis; he sold the house after the war, and it was purchased by Harvard in 2010 and restored by 2016.

In 1942, while still a student of the architecture school, Johnson tried to enlist with Naval Intelligence, and then for a federal job, but was rejected both times. In 1943, after his graduation from Harvard, he was drafted to the Army and was sent to Fort Ritchie, Maryland, to interrogate German prisoners of war. He was investigated by the FBI for his involvement with the German government, Coughlin and Lawrence Dennis, an American fascist economist, and was cleared for continued military service. After the trial of Dennis and his collaborators, Johnson was relieved of his interrogation duties and transferred to Fort Belvoir, Virginia, where he spent the rest of his military service doing routine duties.

==Early Modernist period (1946–1960)==
In 1946, after he completed his schooling and his military service, Johnson returned to the Museum of Modern Art as a curator and writer. At the same time, he began working to establish his architectural practice. He built a small house, influenced by the work of Mies, in Sagaponack, Long Island. In 1947, he published the first monograph in English on the architecture of Mies.

In 1947, he curated the first exhibition of modern architecture of the Museum of Modern Art including a model of the glass Farnsworth House of Mies.

In 1949, he began building a new residence, the Glass House in New Canaan, Connecticut, that was completed in 1949. It was clearly influenced by Farnsworth House of Mies, an influence which Johnson never denied, but looked quite different.

The Glass House is a 56-foot by 32-foot glass rectangle, sited at the edge of a crest on Johnson&#x27;s estate overlooking a pond. The building&#x27;s sides are glass and charcoal-painted steel; the floor, of brick, is not flush with the ground but sits 10 inches above. The interior is an open space divided by low walnut cabinets; a brick cylinder contains the bathroom and is the only object to reach floor to ceiling. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described it in 2005 as &quot;one of the 20th century&#x27;s greatest residential structures. &quot;Like all of Johnson&#x27;s early work, it was inspired by Mies, but its pure symmetry, dark colors and closeness to the earth marked it as a personal statement; calm and ordered rather than sleek and brittle.&quot;Philip wrote that the burnt wooden homes he had seen in Poland &quot;where nothing was left but the foundations and chimneys of brick,&quot; were a further source of inspiration.

Johnson continued to add to the Glass House estate during each period of his career. He added a small pavilion with columns by the lake in 1963, an art gallery set into a hillside in 1965, a postmodern sculpture gallery with a glass roof in 1970; a castle-like library with a rounded tower in 1980; and a concrete block tower dedicated to his friend Lincoln Kirstein, the founder of the New York City Ballet; a chain-link &quot;ghost house&quot; dedicated to Frank Gehry.

After completing the Glass House, he completed two more houses in New Canaan in a style similar to the Glass House; the Hodgson House (1951) and the Wiley House (1953). In New York City, He designed two major modernist additions to the Museum of Modern Art; a new annex, and, to complement it, the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Sculpture Garden (1953)

In 1954–56, he made the pro bono design for Congregation Kneses Tifereth Israel, a synagogue for a conservative Jewish congregation in Port Chester, New York. It had a simple interior and a ceiling of curving plaster panels. 

In 1957, Johnson designed the Soreq Nuclear Research Center in Israel at the invitation of Shimon Peres.

Johnson joined Mies van der Rohe as the architect of record (Mies did not have NY license) for the 39-story Seagram Building (1956). Johnson was pivotal in steering the commission towards Mies by working with Phyllis Lambert, the daughter of the CEO of Seagram. The commission resulted in the iconic bronze-and-glass tower on Park Avenue. The building was designed by Mies, and the interiors of the Four Seasons and Brasserie restaurants (later redesigned), as well as office furniture were designed by Johnson. In December 1955, the city of New York denied an architect&#x27;s permit to Mies. He moved back to Chicago and put Johnson fully in charge of construction. Mies returned in late 1956 and finished the building.

In 1989, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the Seagram&#x27;s exterior, lobby, and The Four Seasons Restaurant as official city landmarks. In 2006, the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places.

== Late Modernism (1960–1980) ==
Throughout the 1960s, Johnson continued to create in the vocabulary of the modernist style, designing geometrical theatres, a monastery, art galleries and gardens. The Munson-Williams-Proctor Arts Institute (1960) is a good example of his work in the period; it is supported by eight external ferro-concrete piers, or two on each side. The exterior structural members are clad in bronze and &quot;black&quot; Canadian granite. The windowless cube is set above the office areas, which recessed in a dry moat, giving a &quot;floating&quot; effect. A model of the building was exhibited in the United States Pavilion at the Brussels&#x27; World&#x27;s Fair of 1958,as an example of the new trends in American architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010.

Another major project of the period was the Atrium of the David H. Koch Theater (formerly the New York State Theatre, the home of the New York City Ballet, at Lincoln Center in New York.

In 1967, Johnson entered a new phase of his career, founding a partnership with architect John Burgee. He began to design office building complexes for large corporations. The most prominent of these was Pennzoil Place (1970–76) in Houston, Texas. The two towers of Pennzoil Place have sloping roofs covering the top seven floors and are trapezoidal in form, planned to create two large triangual areas on the site, which are occupied with glass-covered lobbies designed like greenhouses. This idea was widely copied in skyscrapers in other cities.

The new building of the Boston Public Library (1972), known as the Johnson building, adjoins the original Boston library built in the 19th century by the celebrated firm of McKim, Mead &amp; White. Johnson harmonised his building with the original landmark by using similar proportions and the same pink Milford granite.
In the late 1970s, Johnson combined architecture and landscape architecture to create two imaginative civic gardens. The Fort Worth Water Gardens opened in 1974, is an urban landscape where visitors experience water in distinct ways. The gardens cover 4.3-acres (1.7 hectare), and comprise three very different kinds of water features; One offers a quiet meditation pool, surrounded with cypress trees and high walls, with a thin sheet of water cascading downward to the pool, making the sound of a rain shower. The second pool is an aerating pool with multiple illuminated spray fountains, beneath a grove of oak trees. The third fountain is the Active Pool, which challenges fit visitors to walk down to the pool at the bottom, with water cascading all around them.

In 1977, Johnson completed a much quieter garden in Dallas, Thanks-Giving Square. It features a non-denominational chapel in a spiral form, a meditation garden and cascading fountains, tucked between buildings in the center of the city.

== Postmodern period (1980–1990) ==

In 1980, Johnson and Burgee completed a cathedral in a dramatic new style: the Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove, California, is a soaring glass megachurch originally built for the Reverend Robert H. Schuller. The interior can seat 2,248 persons. It takes the form of a four-pointed star, with free-standing balconies in three points and the chancel in the fourth. The cathedral is covered with more than 10,000 rectangular pieces of glass. The Glass panels are not bolted, but glued to the structure, with a silicon based glue, to give it greater ability to resist Southern California earthquakes. Johnson and Burgee designed it to withstand an earthquake of magnitude 8.0. The tower was added in 1990.

The cathedral quickly became a Southern California landmark, but its costs helped drive the church into debt. When the church declared bankruptcy in 2012, it was purchased by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange and became the Roman Catholic cathedral for Orange County.

Working with John Burgee, Johnson did not confine himself to a single style and was comfortable mixing elements of modernism and postmodernism. For the Cleveland Play House, he built a Romanesque brick structure. His skyscrapers in the 1980s were clad in granite and marble and usually had some feature borrowed from historic architecture. In New York he designed the Museum of Television and Radio (now the Paley Center for Media) (1991).
In 1982, working in collaboration with John Burgee, he finished one of his most famous buildings, 550 Madison Avenue, (first known as AT&amp;T Building, then the Sony building before taking its present name). Built between 1978 and 1982, it is a skyscraper with an eight-story high arched entry and a split pediment at the top which resembles an enormous piece of 18th-century Chippendale furniture. It was not the first work of postmodern architecture, as Robert Venturi and Frank Gehry had already built smaller scale postmodern buildings, and Michael Graves had completed the Portland Building (1980–82) in Portland, Oregon, two years earlier. But the building&#x27;s Manhattan location, size, and originality made it the most famous and recognizable example of postmodern architecture. It was designated a city landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 2018.

Between 1979 and 1984, Johnson and Burgee built PPG Place, the postmodern headquarters of the Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company. It is a complex of six buildings within three city blocks, covering five and a half acres. The centerpiece is the 40-story tower, One PPG Place, which has a crown of spires at the corners which suggest the neogothic tower of the Houses of Parliament in London. During the 1980s, Johnson and Burgee completed a series of other notable postmodern landmarks. The TC Energy Center (formerly Republic Bank Center, later, Bank of America Center), in Houston (1983), was the first postmodern skyscraper in the Houston skyline. Fifty-six stories high, it has two setbacks creating what appear to be three different buildings, one against the other. The three triangular gables were inspired by Flemish Renaissance architecture. The interior and exterior are covered with rough-textured red granite, which also covers the surrounding sidewalks.
The new building for the Hines College of Architecture (1985) of the University of Houston paid homage to forms drawn from earlier periods of architectural history, using modern materials, construction methods, and scale. The facade of the Hines building resembles, on a larger scale, the neoclassic facades of the French architect Claude Nicolas Ledoux.

400 West Market (1993) in Louisville, Kentucky, is a 35-story office tower built of reinforced concrete rather than the typical steel. It is topped by a concrete cupola, a vestige of the building&#x27;s original owner and builder, Capital Holding.

In 1986, Johnson and Burgee moved their offices into one of their new buildings, the elliptical Lipstick Building at 885 Third Avenue in New York, nicknamed because of its resemblance to the color and shape of a stick of lipstick. A feud was beginning between the two architects, with Burgee demanding greater recognition.

As their business flourished and number of clients grew, the feud between Burgee and Johnson continued to grow. In 1988, the firm&#x27;s name was changed to John Burgee Architects with Johnson as the &quot;design consultant&quot;. In 1991, Johnson responded by establishing his own firm. The feud ended badly for Burgee; he was saddled with all of the firm&#x27;s debts, while Johnson no longer had any responsibility. Burgee was eventually forced to declare bankruptcy and to retire, while Johnson continued to get commissions.

==Later career and buildings (1991–2005)==

After four years as a solo practitioner, Johnson invited Alan Ritchie to join him as a partner. Ritchie had been a partner for many years in the Johnson-Burgee office and was the partner-in-charge of the AT&amp;T building and the 190 South LaSalle office building, a skyscraper designed as an homage to the demolished Masonic Temple of Chicago. In 1994, they formed the new practice of Philip Johnson-Alan Ritchie Architects. During the next 10 years, they worked closely together and explored new directions in architecture, designing buildings as sculptural objects.

The Gate of Europe in Madrid (1989-1996) was originally a collaboration with Burgee and one of his rare works in Europe. It features two office buildings leaning toward each other, the first example of this style, which spread to America. The towers are 26 stories each, and both lean by 15 degrees from vertical.

191 Peachtree Tower in Atlanta was a project begun with Burgee. It is composed of two 50-story towers joined and crowned with two classical pavilions.

The Comerica Tower (1991-1993) was also begun with Burgee. Like their earlier Postmodern works, it featured elements borrowed from historical architecture, particularly the triangular gables, borrowed from Renaissance Flemish architecture. It is the second tallest building in the state of Michigan.

The Chapel of St. Basil at the University of St. Thomas in Houston, Texas (1992) is a notable late work. The design includes a domed chapel, a campanile, and a meditation garden, a labyrinth. Its structure is a combination of the basic forms: a cube, a sphere, and a plane. The cube contains the worship area, beneath a semi-sphere, which is presented as the symbolic opening to heaven. The vertical rectangular granite plane divides the church and opens the chapel to light. During daytime the interior is lit entirely with natural light.

In 1995, Johnson added a postmodern element to his own residence, the Glass House. This was a new entry pavilion in a sculptural form, which he called the &quot;Monsta&quot;, or &quot;Monster&quot;.

Other late works include the Cathedral of Hope in Dallas, the Habitable Sculpture (a 26-story apartment tower in lower Manhattan), The Children&#x27;s Museum in Guadalajara, Mexico, and The Chrysler Center.

The Urban Glass House in lower Manhattan was one of last designs with Alan Ritchie, and was not completed after Johnson&#x27;s death. It is a condominium building in lower Manhattan whose form was inspired by Johnson&#x27;s most famous early work, the Glass House in New Canaan, Connecticut.

The final building he designed with Richie was the Pennsylvania Academy of Music building in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, which was completed in 2008, three years after his death.

==Honors==
In 1978, Johnson was awarded an American Institute of Architects Gold Medal. In 1979, he became the first recipient of the Pritzker Architecture Prize the most prestigious international architectural award.

In 1991, Johnson received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

==Personal life==
Johnson was gay. He came out publicly in 1993, and was regarded as &quot;the best-known openly gay architect in America&quot;.

In 1934, Philip Johnson began his first serious relationship with Jimmie Daniels, a cabaret singer. The relationship lasted one year.

Johnson died in his sleep at his Glass House retreat on January 25, 2005, at the age of ninety-eight. His partner of 45 years, David Whitney, died later that year at age 66.

Johnson was among the public figures at the core of the effort to save Olana, the home of Frederic Edwin Church, before it was dedicated a National Historic Landmark in 1965 and subsequently became a New York State Historic Site.

In his will Johnson left his residential compound to the National Trust for Historic Preservation. It is now open to the public.

==Art collection and archives==
As an art collector Johnson had an eclectic eye. He supported avant-garde movements and young artists often before they became widely known. His collection of American art was strong in Abstract expressionism, Pop Art, Minimalism, Neo-Dada, Color Field, Lyrical Abstraction, and Neo-Expressionism and he often donated important works from his collection to institutions like MoMA, and other important private museums and University collections like the Norton Simon Museum, the Sheldon Museum of Art and the Iris &amp; B. Gerald Cantor Center for Visual Arts at Stanford University among many others.

Johnson&#x27;s publicly held archive, including architectural drawings, project records, and other papers up until 1964 are held by the Drawings and Archives Department of Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library at Columbia University, the Getty, and the Museum of Modern Art.

==Controversy over political activities==
Reviewing Franz Schulze&#x27;s biography of Johnson, Kazys Varnelis wrote that &quot;between 1932 and 1940, Johnson was an antisemite, fascist sympathizer, and active propagandist for the Nazi government.&quot; According to Varnelis, &quot;Johnson makes no apologetic gesture toward his past behavior unless he is confronted by direct questioning, nothing even as paltry as an open letter accounting for and regretting his past actions and condemning the motives that led him to them&quot;. Johnson&#x27;s activities included organizing political rallies for populist Huey Long; funding figures such as the right-wing agitator Joe McWilliams and his &quot;Christian Mobilizers&quot;; and writing for three periodicals, including Charles Coughlin&#x27;s &quot;Social Justice&quot;, whose &quot;almost every issue contained articles about the &#x27;Jewish conspiracy&#x27; or about destructive economic forces led by figures with Jewish names&quot;.

Because his family had a home in Germany and spent their summers there, Johnson traveled there frequently. As a &quot;Social Justice&quot; correspondent, he covered the huge Nazi rally at Nuremberg and the 1939 invasion of Poland with approval. The American correspondent William L. Shirer, traveling with him on the Nazi-sponsored press tour, labeled him in &quot;Berlin Diary&quot;, as &quot;the American fascist&quot; and suspected him of spying for the Germans. On the same tour, three weeks after Poland fell to the Nazis, Johnson, with Shirer, &quot;was with German troops at the front as the guest of the Propaganda Ministry&quot;. He wrote to a friend that &quot;The German green uniforms made the place look gay and happy... There were not many Jews to be seen. We saw Warsaw burn and Modlin being bombed. It was a stirring spectacle.&quot;

In his &quot;Social Justice&quot; report on his trip to Poland, Johnson declared that the German victory amounted to an unmitigated triumph for the Polish people and that nothing in the war&#x27;s outcome need concern Americans. Johnson went on to say that German forces had not significantly harmed Polish civilians, and said that &quot;99 percent of the towns I visited since the war are not only intact but full of Polish peasants and Jewish shopkeepers.&quot; He said reports of Nazi mistreatment of Poles was &quot;misinformed&quot;. Referring to political developments in France, Johnson wrote in &quot;Social Justice&quot; that &quot;Lack of leadership and direction in the state has let the one group get control who always gain power in a nation&#x27;s time of weakness—the Jews&quot;. In 1940 Johnson quit journalism and distanced himself from politics.

In April 1942, on reports that Johnson might be working in Colonel Donovan&#x27;s Office of the Coordinator of Information, the United States Assistant Attorney General James H. Rowe wrote to Director Hoover, saying, &quot;I can think of no more dangerous man to have working in an agency which possesses so many military secrets.&quot; Johnson was later investigated by the FBI, but no charges were brought against him, and he was cleared for military service.

Johnson was inducted into the U.S. Army in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on March 12, 1943, but controversy continued. His name arose again in the so-called &quot;Great Sedition Trial&quot; of 1944 through his former contacts in the 1930s with its main target, the former diplomat and economist Lawrence Dennis, who in the 1930s supported fascist economics as an alternative to capitalism. Dennis was charged with sedition, or advocating the forcible overthrow of the U.S. government, under the Smith Act. Johnson was accused of &quot;close and steady contact&quot; with Dennis in the spring of 1938, and providing financial support towards publishing Dennis&#x27;s 1940 book &quot;The Dynamics of War and Revolution&quot;. Johnson had already testified in 1942 in the government case against another former associate, the German poet and journalist George Sylvester Viereck in 1942. The ongoing federal case against Dennis, an FBI investigation, and a congressional investigation investigated about 30 people, including Johnson, but in the end he was not charged. Johnson was formally asked to appear at trial as a witness, and—by his own account—was speaking to prosecutor O. John Rogge, but after Judge Edward C. Eicher died of a heart attack, a mistrial was declared and the case was dropped.

In 1993, when asked by &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; about his past political views, he said, &quot;I have no excuse (for) such unbelievable stupidity. ... I don&#x27;t know how you expiate guilt.&quot;

In 1956, he donated a design for Congregation Kneses Tifereth Israel in Port Chester, New York. Architecture professor Anat Geva observed in a paper that &quot;all critics agree that his design of the Port Chester Synagogue can be considered as his attempt to ask for forgiveness.&quot;

He discussed his trips to Germany and his infatuation with fascism in a 1996 interview with Charlie Rose. He said, &quot;It was the stupidest thing I ever did, and I never forgive myself and I never can atone for it. There&#x27;s nothing I can do... That&#x27;s been torture to me ever since.&quot; He admitted to Rose that, while he had &quot;difficulty&quot; with Franklin D. Roosevelt because of his inability to achieve what he set out, he &quot;worshiped the man&quot; and &quot;voted for him four times.&quot; Replying to Rose asking if he liked &quot;strong figures&quot;, he said &quot;Sure do. I like good architects that are strong, like Gehry.&quot;

In 2018, Nikil Saval wrote in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; that &quot;Johnson would later describe Hitler as &#x27;a spellbinder&#x27;; in 1964, well after he had been forced to abjure his Nazi past, he insisted in letters that Hitler was &#x27;better than Roosevelt.&#x27;&quot;

In 2020, in the wake of the murder of George Floyd and the wave of place name changes that followed, the Johnson Study Group—a group of 40 architects, designers, and educators—approached the Museum of Modern Art asking that honors given to Johnson be removed from public view, citing his &quot;commitment to white supremacy&quot;, spread of Nazi publications, involvement with American fascist politics, and &quot;effective segregation&quot; of the architectural collection at the museum. &quot;When it comes to racist urban planning policies in the 20th century and a deeply Eurocentric antiblack archive of American architecture,&quot; V. Mitch McEwen said, &quot;MoMA under white supremacist Philip Johnson did largely create the problem. It innovated white supremacy in architecture ... where under his leadership not a single work by any Black architect or designer was included.&quot;

In a 2020 article in &quot;Elle Decor&quot; magazine, articles editor Charles Curkin asked Pritzker Prize laureate Balkrishna Doshi if the architecture world was due for a reckoning, citing the Museum of Modern Art&#x27;s chief architecture and design curatorship still being named after Johnson. Doshi replied that &quot;Life itself is due for a reckoning, and architects must give respect to life.&quot;

In 2020, Johnson&#x27;s name was dropped from the Harvard University Philip Johnson Thesis House, which was designed by Johnson. Sarah Whiting, dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Design, announced the change on December 5, 2020, citing Johnson&#x27;s &quot;widely documented white supremacist views and activities.&quot;

==Quotations==
* &quot;I got everything from someone. Nobody can be original. As Mies van der Rohe said, &#x27;I don&#x27;t want to be original. I want to be good.&#x27;&quot;
* &quot;Don&#x27;t build a glass house if you&#x27;re worried about saving money on heating.&quot;
* &quot;Everybody should design their own home. I&#x27;m against architects designing homes. How do I know that you want to live in a picture-window Colonial? It&#x27;s silly, but you might want to. Who am I to say?&quot;
* &quot;Architecture is the arrangement of space for excitement.&quot;
* &quot;Storms in this house [The Glass House] are horrendous but thrilling. Glass shatters. Danger is one of the greatest things to use in architecture.&quot;
* &quot;A room is only as good as you feel when you&#x27;re in it.&quot;
* &quot;Merely that a building works is not sufficient.&quot;
* &quot;We still have a monumental architecture. To me, the drive for monumentality is as inbred as the desire for food and sex, regardless of how we denigrate it.&quot;

==In popular culture==
Johnson is mentioned (along with fellow architect Richard Rogers) in the song &quot;Thru These Architect&#x27;s Eyes&quot; on the album &quot;Outside&quot; (1995) by David Bowie.

He appears in Nathaniel Kahn&#x27;s &quot;My Architect&quot;, a 2003 documentary about Kahn&#x27;s father, Louis Kahn.

Philip Johnson&#x27;s Glass House, along with Mies van der Rohe&#x27;s Farnsworth House, was the subject of Sarah Morris&#x27;s 2010 film &quot;Points on a Line&quot;. Morris filmed at both sites over the course of several months, among other locations including The Four Seasons Restaurant, the Seagram Building, Mies van der Roheʼs controversial 860–880 Lake Shore Drive Apartments, and Chicagoʼs Newberry Library.

Season 3, Episode 6 of the Bad Gays podcast, a history podcast about complicated queer people, covers Johnson&#x27;s life.

<text>The Pritzker Architecture Prize is an international award presented annually &quot;to honor a living architect or architects whose built work demonstrates a combination of those qualities of talent, vision and commitment which has produced consistent and significant contributions to humanity and the built environment through the art of architecture.&quot; Founded in 1979 by Jay A. Pritzker and his wife Cindy, the award is funded by the Pritzker family and sponsored by the Hyatt Foundation. It is considered to be one of the world&#x27;s premier architecture prizes, and is often referred to as the Nobel Prize of architecture.

==Criteria and proceedings==
The Pritzker Architecture Prize Jury says it is awarded &quot;irrespective of nationality, race, creed, or ideology&quot;. The recipients receive US$100,000, a citation certificate, and, since 1987, a bronze medallion. The designs on the medal are inspired by the work of architect Louis Sullivan, while the Latin inspired inscription on the reverse of the medallion—&quot;firmitas, utilitas, venustas&quot; (English: firmness, commodity and delight)—is from Ancient Roman architect Vitruvius. Before 1987, a limited edition Henry Moore sculpture accompanied the monetary prize.

The executive director of the prize, Manuela Lucá-Dazio, solicits nominations from a range of people, including past Laureates, academics, critics and others &quot;with expertise and interest in the field of architecture&quot;. Any licensed architect can also make a personal application for the prize before November 1 every year. (In 1988 Gordon Bunshaft nominated himself for the award and eventually won it.) The jury, consisting of five to nine &quot;experts ... recognized professionals in their own fields of architecture, business, education, publishing, and culture&quot;, deliberates and early in the following year announce the winner. The prize chair is the 2016 Pritzker laureate Alejandro Aravena; earlier chairs were J. Carter Brown (1979–2002), the Lord Rothschild (2003–2004), the Lord Palumbo (2005–2015), Glenn Murcutt (2016–2018) and Stephen Breyer (2019–2020).

== Laureates ==

Inaugural winner Philip Johnson was cited &quot;for 50 years of imagination and vitality embodied in a myriad of museums, theaters, libraries, houses, gardens and corporate structures&quot;. The 2004 laureate Zaha Hadid was the first female prize winner. Ryue Nishizawa became the youngest winner in 2010 at age 44. Partners in architecture (in 2001, Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron, in 2010, Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa, in 2020, Yvonne Farrell and Shelley McNamara, and in 2021, Anne Lacaton and Jean-Philippe Vassal) have shared the award. In 1988, Gordon Bunshaft and Oscar Niemeyer were both separately honored with the award. The 2017 winners, architects Rafael Aranda, Carme Pigem, and Ramon Vilalta were the first group of three to share the prize.

== Criticism ==
In 2013, the student organization &quot;Women in Design&quot; at the Harvard Graduate School of Design started a petition arguing Denise Scott Brown should receive joint recognition with her partner, Robert Venturi, who won the award in 1991. The petition, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;reignited long-simmering tensions in the architectural world over whether women have been consistently denied the standing they deserve in a field whose most prestigious award was not given to a woman until 2004, when Zaha Hadid won&quot;. Scott Brown told CNN that &quot;as a woman, she had felt excluded by the elite of architecture throughout her career,&quot; and that &quot;the Pritzker Prize was based on the fallacy that great architecture was the work of a &#x27;single lone male genius&#x27; at the expense of collaborative work.&quot; Responding to the petition, the 2013 prize jury said that it cannot revisit the decisions of past juries, either in the case of Scott Brown or that of Lu Wenyu, whose husband Wang Shu won in 2012. The 2020 Pritzker jury said in its citation awarding the prize to Yvonne Farrell and Shelley McNamara – making them the fourth and fifth women to ever be awarded the prize – that they were, &quot;pioneers in a field that has traditionally been and still is a male-dominated profession [and] beacons to others as they forge their exemplary professional path.&quot;

<text>Louis-Hector Berlioz (11 December 1803 – 8 March 1869) was a French Romantic composer and conductor. His output includes orchestral works such as the &quot;Symphonie fantastique&quot; and &quot;Harold in Italy&quot;, choral pieces including the Requiem and &quot;L&#x27;Enfance du Christ&quot;, his three operas &quot;Benvenuto Cellini&quot;, &quot;Les Troyens&quot; and &quot;Béatrice et Bénédict&quot;, and works of hybrid genres such as the &quot;dramatic symphony&quot; &quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot; and the &quot;dramatic legend&quot; &quot;La Damnation de Faust&quot;.

The elder son of a provincial physician, Berlioz was expected to follow his father into medicine, and he attended a Parisian medical college before defying his family by taking up music as a profession. His independence of mind and refusal to follow traditional rules and formulas put him at odds with the conservative musical establishment of Paris. He briefly moderated his style sufficiently to win France&#x27;s premier music prize – the Prix de Rome – in 1830, but he learned little from the academics of the Paris Conservatoire. Opinion was divided for many years between those who thought him an original genius and those who viewed his music as lacking in form and coherence.

At the age of twenty-four Berlioz fell in love with the Irish Shakespearean actress Harriet Smithson, and he pursued her obsessively until she finally accepted him seven years later. Their marriage was happy at first but eventually foundered. Harriet inspired his first major success, the &quot;Symphonie fantastique&quot;, in which an idealised depiction of her occurs throughout.

Berlioz completed three operas, the first of which, &quot;Benvenuto Cellini&quot;, was an outright failure. The second, the epic &quot;Les Troyens&quot; (The Trojans), was so large in scale that it was never staged in its entirety during his lifetime. His last opera, &quot;Béatrice et Bénédict&quot;based on Shakespeare&#x27;s comedy &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;was a success at its premiere but did not enter the regular operatic repertoire. Meeting only occasional success in France as a composer, Berlioz increasingly turned to conducting, in which he gained an international reputation. He was highly regarded in Germany, Britain and Russia both as a composer and as a conductor. To supplement his earnings he wrote musical journalism throughout much of his career; some of it has been preserved in book form, including his &quot;Treatise on Instrumentation&quot; (1844), which was influential in the 19th and 20th centuries. Berlioz died in Paris at the age of 65.
==Life and career==

===1803–1821: early years ===
Berlioz was born on 11 December 1803, the eldest child of (1776–1848), a physician, and his wife, Marie-Antoinette Joséphine, &quot;née&quot; Marmion (1784–1838). His birthplace was the family home in the commune of La Côte-Saint-André in the département of Isère, in south-eastern France. His parents had five more children, three of whom died in infancy; their surviving daughters, Nanci and Adèle, remained close to Berlioz throughout their lives.

Berlioz&#x27;s father, a respected local figure, was a progressively minded doctor credited as the first European to practise and write about acupuncture. He was an agnostic with a liberal outlook; his wife was a strict Roman Catholic of less flexible views. After briefly attending a local school when he was about ten, Berlioz was educated at home by his father. He recalled in his &quot;Mémoires&quot; that he enjoyed geography, especially books about travel, to which his mind would sometimes wander when he was supposed to be studying Latin; the classics nonetheless made an impression on him, and he was moved to tears by Virgil&#x27;s account of the tragedy of Dido and Aeneas. Later he studied philosophy, rhetoric, and – because his father planned a medical career for him – anatomy.

Music did not feature prominently in the young Berlioz&#x27;s education. His father gave him basic instruction on the flageolet, and he later took flute and guitar lessons with local teachers. He never studied the piano, and throughout his life played haltingly at best. He later contended that this was an advantage because it &quot;saved me from the tyranny of keyboard habits, so dangerous to thought, and from the lure of conventional harmonies&quot;.

At the age of twelve Berlioz fell in love for the first time. The object of his affections was an eighteen-year-old neighbour, Estelle Dubœuf. He was teased for what was seen as a boyish infatuation, but something of his early passion for Estelle endured all his life. He poured some of his unrequited feelings into his early attempts at composition. Trying to master harmony, he read Rameau&#x27;s &quot;Traité de l&#x27;harmonie&quot;, which proved incomprehensible to a novice, but Charles-Simon Catel&#x27;s simpler treatise on the subject made it clearer to him. He wrote several chamber works as a youth, subsequently destroying the manuscripts, but one theme that remained in his mind reappeared later as the A-flat second subject of the overture to &quot;Les Francs-juges&quot;.

===1821–1824: Medical student===
In March 1821 Berlioz passed the baccalauréat examination at the University of Grenoble – it is not certain whether at the first or second attempt – and in late September, aged seventeen, he moved to Paris. At his father&#x27;s insistence he enrolled at the School of Medicine of the University of Paris. He had to fight hard to overcome his revulsion at dissecting bodies, but in deference to his father&#x27;s wishes, he forced himself to continue his medical studies.
The horrors of the medical college were mitigated thanks to an ample allowance from his father, which enabled him to take full advantage of the cultural, and particularly musical, life of Paris. Music did not at that time enjoy the prestige of literature in French culture, but Paris nonetheless possessed two major opera houses and the country&#x27;s most important music library. Berlioz took advantage of them all. Within days of arriving in Paris he went to the Opéra, and although the piece on offer was by a minor composer, the staging and the magnificent orchestral playing enchanted him. He went to other works at the Opéra and the Opéra-Comique; at the former, three weeks after his arrival, he saw Gluck&#x27;s &quot;Iphigénie en Tauride&quot;, which thrilled him. He was particularly inspired by Gluck&#x27;s use of the orchestra to carry the drama along. A later performance of the same work at the Opéra convinced him that his vocation was to be a composer.

The dominance of Italian opera in Paris, against which Berlioz later campaigned, was still in the future, and at the opera houses he heard and absorbed the works of Étienne Méhul and François-Adrien Boieldieu, other operas written in the French style by foreign composers, particularly Gaspare Spontini, and above all five operas by Gluck. He began to visit the Paris Conservatoire library in between his medical studies, seeking out scores of Gluck&#x27;s operas and making copies of parts of them. By the end of 1822 he felt that his attempts to learn composition needed to be augmented with formal tuition, and he approached Jean-François Le Sueur, director of the Royal Chapel and professor at the Conservatoire, who accepted him as a private pupil.

In August 1823 Berlioz made the first of many contributions to the musical press: a letter to the journal &quot;Le Corsaire&quot; defending French opera against the incursions of its Italian rival. He contended that all Rossini&#x27;s operas put together could not stand comparison with even a few bars of those of Gluck, Spontini or Le Sueur. By now he had composed several works including &quot;Estelle et Némorin&quot; and &quot;Le Passage de la mer Rouge&quot; (The Crossing of the Red Sea) – both since lost.

In 1824 Berlioz graduated from medical school, after which he abandoned medicine, to the strong disapproval of his parents. His father suggested law as an alternative profession and refused to countenance music as a career. He reduced and sometimes withheld his son&#x27;s allowance, and Berlioz went through some years of financial hardship.

===1824–1830: Conservatoire student===
In 1824 Berlioz composed a &quot;Messe solennelle&quot;. It was performed twice, after which he suppressed the score, which was thought lost until a copy was discovered in 1991. During 1825 and 1826 he wrote his first opera, &quot;Les Francs-juges&quot;, which was not performed and survives only in fragments, the best known of which is the overture. In later works he reused parts of the score, such as the &quot;March of the Guards&quot;, which he incorporated four years later in the &quot;Symphonie fantastique&quot; as the &quot;March to the Scaffold&quot;.
In August 1826 Berlioz was admitted as a student to the Conservatoire, studying composition under Le Sueur and counterpoint and fugue with Anton Reicha. In the same year he made the first of four attempts to win France&#x27;s premier music prize, the Prix de Rome, and was eliminated in the first round. The following year, to earn some money, he joined the chorus at the Théâtre des Nouveautés. He competed again for the Prix de Rome, submitting the first of his Prix cantatas, &quot;La Mort d&#x27;Orphée&quot;, in July. Later that year he attended productions of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; and &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; at the Théâtre de l&#x27;Odéon given by Charles Kemble&#x27;s touring company. Although at the time Berlioz spoke hardly any English, he was overwhelmed by the plays – the start of a lifelong passion for Shakespeare. He also conceived a passion for Kemble&#x27;s leading lady, Harriet Smithson – his biographer Hugh Macdonald calls it &quot;emotional derangement&quot; – and obsessively pursued her, without success, for several years. She refused even to meet him.

The first concert of Berlioz&#x27;s music took place in May 1828, when his friend Nathan Bloc conducted the premieres of the overtures &quot;Les Francs-juges&quot; and &quot;Waverley&quot; and other works. The hall was far from full, and Berlioz lost money. Nevertheless, he was greatly encouraged by the vociferous approval of his performers, and the applause from musicians in the audience, including his Conservatoire professors, the directors of the Opéra and Opéra-Comique, and the composers Auber and Hérold.

Berlioz&#x27;s fascination with Shakespeare&#x27;s plays prompted him to start learning English during 1828, so that he could read them in the original. At around the same time he encountered two further creative inspirations: Beethoven and Goethe. He heard Beethoven&#x27;s third, fifth and seventh symphonies performed at the Conservatoire, and read Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot; in Gérard de Nerval&#x27;s translation. Beethoven became both an ideal and an obstacle for Berlioz – an inspiring predecessor but a daunting one. Goethe&#x27;s work was the basis of &quot;Huit scènes de Faust&quot; (Berlioz&#x27;s Opus 1), which premiered the following year and was reworked and expanded much later as &quot;La Damnation de Faust&quot;.

===1830–1832: Prix de Rome===
Berlioz was largely apolitical, and neither supported nor opposed the July Revolution of 1830, but when it broke out he found himself in the middle of it. He recorded events in his &quot;Mémoires&quot;:

The cantata was &quot;La Mort de Sardanapale&quot;, with which he won the Prix de Rome. His entry the previous year, &quot;Cléopâtre&quot;, had attracted disapproval from the judges because to highly conservative musicians it &quot;betrayed dangerous tendencies&quot;, and for his 1830 offering he carefully modified his natural style to meet official approval. During the same year he wrote the &quot;Symphonie fantastique&quot; and became engaged to be married.
By now recoiling from his obsession with Smithson, Berlioz fell in love with a nineteen-year-old pianist, Marie (&quot;Camille&quot;) Moke. His feelings were reciprocated, and the couple planned to be married. In December Berlioz organised a concert at which the &quot;Symphonie fantastique&quot; was premiered. Protracted applause followed the performance, and the press reviews expressed both the shock and the pleasure the work had given. Berlioz&#x27;s biographer David Cairns calls the concert a landmark not only in the composer&#x27;s career but in the evolution of the modern orchestra. Franz Liszt was among those attending the concert; this was the beginning of a long friendship. Liszt later transcribed the entire &quot;Symphonie fantastique&quot; for piano to enable more people to hear it.

Shortly after the concert Berlioz set off for Italy: under the terms of the Prix de Rome, winners studied for two years at the Villa Medici, the French Academy in Rome. Within three weeks of his arrival he went absent without leave: he had learnt that Marie had broken off their engagement and was to marry an older and richer suitor, Camille Pleyel, the heir to the Pleyel piano manufacturing company. Berlioz made an elaborate plan to kill them both (and her mother, known to him as &quot;l&#x27;hippopotame&quot;), and acquired poisons, pistols and a disguise for the purpose. By the time he reached Nice on his journey to Paris he thought better of the scheme, abandoned the idea of revenge, and successfully sought permission to return to the Villa Medici. He stayed for a few weeks in Nice and wrote his &quot;King Lear&quot; overture. On the way back to Rome he began work on a piece for narrator, solo voices, chorus and orchestra, &quot;Le Retour à la vie&quot; (The Return to Life, later renamed &quot;Lélio&quot;), a sequel to the &quot;Symphonie fantastique&quot;.
Berlioz took little pleasure in his time in Rome. His colleagues at the Villa Medici, under their benevolent principal Horace Vernet, made him welcome, and he enjoyed his meetings with Felix Mendelssohn, who was visiting the city, but he found Rome distasteful: &quot;the most stupid and prosaic city I know; it is no place for anyone with head or heart.&quot; Nonetheless, Italy had an important influence on his development. He visited many parts of it during his residency in Rome. Macdonald comments that after his time there, Berlioz had &quot;a new colour and glow in his music ... sensuous and vivacious&quot; – derived not from Italian painting, in which he was uninterested, or Italian music, which he despised, but from &quot;the scenery and the sun, and from his acute sense of locale&quot;. Macdonald identifies &quot;Harold in Italy&quot;, &quot;Benvenuto Cellini&quot; and &quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot; as the most obvious expressions of his response to Italy, and adds that &quot;Les Troyens&quot; and &quot;Béatrice et Bénédict&quot; &quot;reflect the warmth and stillness of the Mediterranean, as well as its vivacity and force&quot;. Berlioz himself wrote that &quot;Harold in Italy&quot; drew on &quot;the poetic memories formed from my wanderings in Abruzzi&quot;.

Vernet agreed to Berlioz&#x27;s request to be allowed to leave the Villa Medici before the end of his two-year term. Heeding Vernet&#x27;s advice that it would be prudent to delay his return to Paris, where the Conservatoire authorities might be less indulgent about his premature ending of his studies, he made a leisurely journey back, detouring via La Côte-Saint-André to see his family. He left Rome in May 1832 and arrived in Paris in November.

===1832–1840: Paris===
On 9 December 1832 Berlioz presented a concert of his works at the Conservatoire. The programme included the overture of &quot;Les Francs-juges&quot;, the &quot;Symphonie fantastique&quot; – extensively revised since its premiere – and &quot;Le Retour à la vie&quot;, in which Bocage, a popular actor, declaimed the monologues. Through a third party, Berlioz had sent an invitation to Harriet Smithson, who accepted, and was dazzled by the celebrities in the audience. Among the musicians present were Liszt, Frédéric Chopin and Niccolò Paganini; writers included Alexandre Dumas, Théophile Gautier, Heinrich Heine, Victor Hugo and George Sand. The concert was such a success that the programme was repeated within the month, but the more immediate consequence was that Berlioz and Smithson finally met.

By 1832 Smithson&#x27;s career was in decline. She presented a ruinously unsuccessful season, first at the Théâtre-Italien and then at lesser venues, and by March 1833 she was deep in debt. Biographers differ about whether and to what extent Smithson&#x27;s receptiveness to Berlioz&#x27;s wooing was motivated by financial considerations; but she accepted him, and in the face of strong opposition from both their families they were married at the British Embassy in Paris on 3 October 1833. The couple lived first in Paris, and later in Montmartre (then still a village). On 14 August 1834 their only child, Louis-Clément-Thomas, was born. The first few years of the marriage were happy, although it eventually foundered. Harriet continued to yearn for a career but, as her biographer Peter Raby comments, she never learned to speak French fluently, which seriously limited both her professional and her social life.
Paganini, known chiefly as a violinist, had acquired a Stradivarius viola, which he wanted to play in public if he could find the right music. Greatly impressed by the &quot;Symphonie fantastique&quot;, he asked Berlioz to write him a suitable piece. Berlioz told him that he could not write a brilliantly virtuoso work, and began composing what he called a symphony with viola obbligato, &quot;Harold in Italy&quot;. As he foresaw, Paganini found the solo part too reticent – &quot;There&#x27;s not enough for me to do here; I should be playing all the time&quot; – and the violist at the premiere in November 1834 was Chrétien Urhan.

Until the end of 1835 Berlioz had a modest stipend as a laureate of the Prix de Rome. His earnings from composing were neither substantial nor regular, and he supplemented them by writing music criticism for the Parisian press. Macdonald comments that this was activity &quot;at which he excelled but which he abhorred&quot;. He wrote for &quot;L&#x27;Europe littéraire&quot; (1833), &quot;Le Rénovateur&quot; (1833–1835), and from 1834 for the &quot;Gazette musicale&quot; and the &quot;Journal des débats&quot;. He was the first, but not the last, prominent French composer to double as a reviewer: among his successors were Fauré, Messager, Dukas and Debussy. Although he complained – both privately and sometimes in his articles – that his time would be better spent writing music than in writing music criticism, he was able to indulge himself in attacking his bêtes noires and extolling his enthusiasms. The former included musical pedants, coloratura writing and singing, viola players who were merely incompetent violinists, inane libretti, and baroque counterpoint. He extravagantly praised Beethoven&#x27;s symphonies, and Gluck&#x27;s and Weber&#x27;s operas, and scrupulously refrained from promoting his own compositions. His journalism consisted mainly of music criticism, some of which he collected and published, such as &quot;Evenings in the Orchestra&quot; (1854), but also more technical articles, such as those that formed the basis of his &quot;Treatise on Instrumentation&quot; (1844). Despite his complaints, Berlioz continued writing music criticism for most of his life, long after he had any financial need to do so.

Berlioz secured a commission from the French government for his Requiem – the &quot;Grande messe des morts&quot; – first performed at Les Invalides in December 1837. A second government commission followed – the &quot;Grande symphonie funèbre et triomphale&quot; in 1840. Neither work brought him much money or artistic fame at the time, but the Requiem held a special place in his affections: &quot;If I were threatened with the destruction of the whole of my works save one, I would crave mercy for the &quot;Messe des morts&quot;&quot;.
One of Berlioz&#x27;s main aims in the 1830s was &quot;battering down the doors of the Opéra&quot;. In Paris at this period, the musical success that mattered was in the opera house and not the concert hall. Robert Schumann commented, &quot;To the French, music by itself means nothing&quot;. Berlioz worked on his opera &quot;Benvenuto Cellini&quot; from 1834 until 1837, continually distracted by his increasing activities as a critic and as a promoter of his own symphonic concerts. The Berlioz scholar D. Kern Holoman comments that Berlioz rightly regarded &quot;Benvenuto Cellini&quot; as a work of exceptional exuberance and verve, deserving a better reception than it received. Holoman adds that the piece was of &quot;surpassing technical difficulty&quot;, and that the singers were not especially co-operative. A weak libretto and unsatisfactory staging exacerbated the poor reception. The opera had only four complete performances, three in September 1838 and one in January 1839. Berlioz said that the failure of the piece meant that the doors of the Opéra were closed to him for the rest of his career – which they were, except for a commission to arrange a Weber score in 1841.

Shortly after the failure of the opera, Berlioz had a great success as composer-conductor of a concert at which &quot;Harold in Italy&quot; was given again. This time Paganini was present in the audience; he came on to the platform at the end and knelt in homage to Berlioz and kissed his hand. A few days later Berlioz was astonished to receive a cheque from him for 20,000 francs. Paganini&#x27;s gift enabled Berlioz to pay off Harriet&#x27;s and his own debts, give up music criticism for the time being, and concentrate on composition. He wrote the &quot;dramatic symphony&quot; &quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot; for voices, chorus and orchestra. It was premiered in November 1839 and was so well received that Berlioz and his huge instrumental and vocal forces gave two further performances in rapid succession. Among the audiences was the young Wagner, who was overwhelmed by its revelation of the possibilities of musical poetry, and who later drew on it when composing &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;.

At the close of the decade Berlioz achieved official recognition in the form of appointment as deputy librarian of the Conservatoire and as an officer of the Legion of Honour. The former was an undemanding post, but not highly paid, and Berlioz remained in need of a reliable income to allow him the leisure for composition.

=== 1840s: Struggling composer ===

The &quot;Symphonie funèbre et triomphale&quot;, marking the tenth anniversary of the 1830 Revolution, was performed in the open air under the direction of the composer in July 1840. The following year the Opéra commissioned Berlioz to adapt Weber&#x27;s &quot;Der Freischütz&quot; to meet the house&#x27;s rigid requirements: he wrote recitatives to replace the spoken dialogue and orchestrated Weber&#x27;s &quot;Invitation to the Dance&quot; to provide the obligatory ballet music. In the same year he completed settings of six poems by his friend Théophile Gautier, which formed the song cycle &quot;Les Nuits d&#x27;été&quot; (with piano accompaniment, later orchestrated). He also worked on a projected opera, &quot;La Nonne sanglante&quot; (The Bloody Nun), to a libretto by Eugène Scribe, but made little progress. In November 1841 he began publishing a series of sixteen articles in the &quot;Revue et gazette musicale&quot; giving his views about orchestration; they were the basis of his &quot;Treatise on Instrumentation&quot;, published in 1843.

During the 1840s Berlioz spent much of his time making music outside France. He struggled to make money from his concerts in Paris, and learning of the large sums made by promoters from performances of his music in other countries, he resolved to try conducting abroad. He began in Brussels, giving two concerts in September 1842. An extensive German tour followed: in 1842 and 1843 he gave concerts in twelve German cities. His reception was enthusiastic. The German public was better disposed than the French to his innovative compositions, and his conducting was seen as highly impressive. During the tour he had enjoyable meetings with Mendelssohn and Schumann in Leipzig, Wagner in Dresden and Meyerbeer in Berlin.
By this time Berlioz&#x27;s marriage was failing. Harriet resented his celebrity and her own eclipse, and as Raby puts it, &quot;possessiveness turned to suspicion and jealousy as Berlioz became involved with the singer Marie Recio&quot;. Harriet&#x27;s health deteriorated, and she took to drinking heavily. Her suspicion about Recio was well founded: the latter became Berlioz&#x27;s mistress in 1841 and accompanied him on his German tour.

Berlioz returned to Paris in mid-1843. During the following year he wrote two of his most popular short works, the overtures &quot;Le carnaval romain&quot; (reusing music from &quot;Benvenuto Cellini&quot;) and &quot;Le corsaire&quot; (originally called &quot;La tour de Nice&quot;). Towards the end of the year he and Harriet separated. Berlioz maintained two households: Harriet remained in Montmartre and he moved in with Recio at her flat in central Paris. His son Louis was sent to a boarding school in Rouen.

Foreign tours featured prominently in Berlioz&#x27;s life during the 1840s and 1850s. Not only were they highly rewarding both artistically and financially, but he did not have to grapple with the administrative problems of promoting concerts in Paris. Macdonald comments:

Berlioz&#x27;s major work from the decade was &quot;La Damnation de Faust&quot;. He presented it in Paris in December 1846, but it played to half-empty houses, despite excellent reviews, some from critics not usually well disposed to his music. The highly romantic subject was out of step with the times, and one sympathetic reviewer observed that there was an unbridgeable gap between the composer&#x27;s conception of art and that of the Paris public. The failure of the piece left Berlioz heavily in debt; he restored his finances the following year with the first of two highly remunerative trips to Russia. His other foreign tours during the rest of the 1840s included Austria, Hungary, Bohemia and Germany. After those came the first of his five visits to England; it lasted for more than seven months (November 1847 to July 1848). His reception in London was enthusiastic, but the visit was not a financial success because of mismanagement by his impresario, the conductor Louis-Antoine Jullien.

Soon after Berlioz&#x27;s return to Paris in mid-September 1848, Harriet suffered a series of strokes, which left her almost paralysed. She needed constant nursing, which he paid for. When in Paris he visited her continually, sometimes twice a day.

===1850s: international success===

After the failure of &quot;La Damnation de Faust&quot;, Berlioz spent less time on composition during the next eight years. He wrote a Te Deum, completed in 1849 but not published until 1855, and some short pieces. His most substantial work between &quot;The Damnation&quot; and his epic &quot;Les Troyens&quot; (1856–1858) was a &quot;sacred trilogy&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Enfance du Christ&quot; (Christ&#x27;s Childhood), which he began in 1850. In 1851 he was at the Great Exhibition in London as a member of an international committee judging musical instruments. He returned to London in 1852 and 1853, conducting his own works and others&#x27;. He enjoyed consistent success there, with the exception of a revival of &quot;Benvenuto Cellini&quot; at Covent Garden which was withdrawn after one performance. The opera was presented in Leipzig in 1852 in a revised version prepared by Liszt with Berlioz&#x27;s approval and was moderately successful. In the early years of the decade Berlioz made numerous appearances in Germany as a conductor.

In 1854 Harriet died. Both Berlioz and their son Louis had been with her shortly before her death. During the year Berlioz completed the composition of &quot;L&#x27;Enfance du Christ&quot;, worked on his book of memoirs, and married Marie Recio, which, he explained to his son, he felt it his duty to do after living with her for so many years. At the end of the year the first performance of &quot;L&#x27;Enfance du Christ&quot; was warmly received, to his surprise. He spent much of the next year in conducting and writing prose.

During Berlioz&#x27;s German tour in 1856, Liszt and his companion, Carolyne zu Sayn-Wittgenstein, encouraged Berlioz&#x27;s tentative conception of an opera based on the &quot;Aeneid&quot;. Having first completed the orchestration of his 1841 song cycle &quot;Les Nuits d&#x27;été&quot;, he began work on &quot;Les Troyens&quot; – The Trojans – writing his own libretto based on Virgil&#x27;s epic. He worked on it, in between his conducting commitments, for two years. In 1858 he was elected to the Institut de France, an honour he had long sought, though he played down the importance he attached to it. In the same year he completed &quot;Les Troyens&quot;. He then spent five years trying to have it staged.

===1860–1869: final years===
In June 1862 Berlioz&#x27;s wife died suddenly, aged 48. She was survived by her mother, to whom Berlioz was devoted, and who looked after him for the rest of his life.

&quot;Les Troyens&quot; – a five-act, five-hour opera – was on too large a scale to be acceptable to the management of the Opéra, and Berlioz&#x27;s efforts to have it staged there failed. The only way he could find of seeing the work produced was to divide it into two parts: &quot;The Fall of Troy&quot; and &quot;The Trojans at Carthage&quot;. The latter, consisting of the final three acts of the original, was presented at the Théâtre‐Lyrique, Paris, in November 1863, but even that truncated version was further truncated: during the run of 22 performances, number after number was cut. The experience demoralised Berlioz, who wrote no more music after this.

Berlioz did not seek a revival of &quot;Les Troyens&quot; and none took place for nearly 30 years. He sold the publishing rights for a large sum, and his last years were financially comfortable; he was able to give up his work as a critic, but he lapsed into depression. As well as losing both his wives, he had lost both his sisters, and he became morbidly aware of death as many of his friends and other contemporaries died. He and his son had grown deeply attached to each other, but Louis was a captain in the merchant navy, and was more often than not away from home. Berlioz&#x27;s physical health was not good, and he was often in pain from an intestinal complaint, possibly Crohn&#x27;s disease.

After the death of his second wife, Berlioz had two romantic interludes. During 1862 he met – probably in the Montmartre Cemetery – a young woman less than half his age, whose first name was Amélie and whose second, possibly married, name is not recorded. Almost nothing is known of their relationship, which lasted for less than a year. After they ceased to meet, Amélie died, aged only 26. Berlioz was unaware of it until he came across her grave six months later. Cairns hypothesises that the shock of her death prompted him to seek out his first love, Estelle, now a widow aged 67. He called on her in September 1864; she received him kindly, and he visited her in three successive summers; he wrote to her nearly every month for the rest of his life.

In 1867 Berlioz received the news that his son had died in Havana of yellow fever. Macdonald suggests that Berlioz may have sought distraction from his grief by going ahead with a planned series of concerts in St Petersburg and Moscow, but far from rejuvenating him, the trip sapped his remaining strength. The concerts were successful, and Berlioz received a warm response from the new generation of Russian composers and the general public, but he returned to Paris visibly unwell. He went to Nice to recuperate in the Mediterranean climate, but fell on rocks by the shore, possibly because of a stroke, and had to return to Paris, where he convalesced for several months. In August 1868, he felt able to travel briefly to Grenoble to judge a choral festival. After arriving back in Paris he gradually grew weaker and died at his house in the Rue de Calais on 8 March 1869, at the age of 65. He was buried in Montmartre Cemetery with his two wives, who were exhumed and re-buried next to him.

==Works==

In his 1983 book &quot;The Musical Language of Berlioz&quot;, Julian Rushton asks &quot;where Berlioz comes in the history of musical forms and what is his progeny&quot;. Rushton&#x27;s answers to these questions are &quot;nowhere&quot; and &quot;none&quot;. He cites well-known studies of musical history in which Berlioz is mentioned only in passing or not at all, and suggests that this is partly because Berlioz had no models among his predecessors and was a model to none of his successors. &quot;In his works, as in his life, Berlioz was a lone wolf&quot;. Forty years earlier, Sir Thomas Beecham, a lifelong proponent of Berlioz&#x27;s music, commented similarly, writing that although, for example, Mozart was a greater composer, his music drew on the works of his predecessors, whereas Berlioz&#x27;s works were all wholly original: &quot;the &quot;Symphonie fantastique&quot; or &quot;La Damnation de Faust&quot; broke upon the world like some unaccountable effort of spontaneous generation which had dispensed with the machinery of normal parentage&quot;.

Rushton suggests that &quot;Berlioz&#x27;s way is neither architectural nor developmental, but illustrative&quot;. He judges this to be part of a continuing French musical aesthetic, favouring a &quot;decorative&quot; – rather than the German &quot;architectural&quot; – approach to composition. Abstraction and discursiveness are alien to this tradition, and in operas, and to a large extent in orchestral music, there is little continuous development; instead self-contained numbers or sections are preferred.

Berlioz&#x27;s compositional techniques have been strongly criticised and equally strongly defended. It is common ground for critics and defenders that his approach to harmony and musical structure conforms to no established rules; his detractors ascribe this to ignorance, and his proponents to independent-minded adventurousness. His approach to rhythm caused perplexity to conservatively-inclined contemporaries; he hated the &quot;phrase carrée&quot; – the unvaried four- or eight-bar phrase – and introduced new varieties of rhythm to his music. He explained his practice in an 1837 article: accenting weak beats at the expense of the strong, alternating triple and duple groups of notes and using unexpected rhythmic themes independent of the main melody. Macdonald writes that Berlioz was a natural melodist, but that his rhythmic sense led him away from regular phrase lengths; he &quot;spoke naturally in a kind of flexible musical prose, with surprise and contour important elements&quot;.

Berlioz&#x27;s approach to harmony and counterpoint was idiosyncratic, and has provoked adverse criticism. Pierre Boulez commented, &quot;There are awkward harmonies in Berlioz that make one scream&quot;. In Rushton&#x27;s analysis, most of Berlioz&#x27;s melodies have &quot;clear tonal and harmonic implications&quot; but the composer sometimes chose not to harmonise accordingly. Rushton observes that Berlioz&#x27;s preference for irregular rhythm subverts conventional harmony: &quot;Classic and romantic melody usually implies harmonic motion of some consistency and smoothness; Berlioz&#x27;s aspiration to musical prose tends to resist such consistency.&quot; The pianist and musical analyst Charles Rosen has written that Berlioz often sets the climax of his melodies in relief with the most emphatic chord a triad in root position, and often a tonic chord where the melody leads the listener to expect a dominant. He gives as an example the second phrase of the main theme – the &quot;idée fixe&quot; – of the &quot;Symphonie fantastique&quot;, &quot;famous for its shock to classical sensibilities&quot;, in which the melody implies a dominant at its climax resolved by a tonic, but in which Berlioz anticipates the resolution by putting a tonic under the climactic note.

Even among those unsympathetic to his music, few deny that Berlioz was a master of orchestration. Richard Strauss wrote that Berlioz invented the modern orchestra. Some of those who recognise Berlioz&#x27;s mastery of orchestration nonetheless dislike a few of his more extreme effects. The pedal point for trombones in the &quot;Hostias&quot; section of the Requiem is often cited; some musicians such as Gordon Jacob have found the effect unpleasant. Macdonald has questioned Berlioz&#x27;s fondness for divided cellos and basses in dense, low chords, but he emphasises that such contentious points are rare compared with &quot;the felicities and masterstrokes&quot; abounding in the scores. Berlioz took instruments hitherto used for special purposes and introduced them into his regular orchestra: Macdonald mentions the harp, the cor anglais, the bass clarinet and the valve trumpet. Among the characteristic touches in Berlioz&#x27;s orchestration singled out by Macdonald are the wind &quot;chattering on repeated notes&quot; for brilliance, or being used to add &quot;sombre colour&quot; to Romeo&#x27;s arrival at the Capulets&#x27; vault, and the &quot;Chœur d&#x27;ombres&quot; in &quot;Lélio&quot;. Of Berlioz&#x27;s brass he writes:

===Symphonies===
Berlioz wrote four large-scale works he called symphonies, but his conception of the genre differed greatly from the classical pattern of the German tradition. With rare exceptions, such as Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth, a symphony was taken to be a large‐scale wholly orchestral work, usually in four movements, using sonata form in the first movement and sometimes in others. Some pictorial touches were included in symphonies by Beethoven, Mendelssohn and others, but the symphony was not customarily used to recount a narrative.


All four of Berlioz&#x27;s symphonies differ from the contemporary norm. The first, the &quot;Symphonie fantastique&quot; (1830), is purely orchestral, and the opening movement is broadly in sonata form, but the work tells a story, graphically and specifically. The recurring &quot;idée fixe&quot; theme is the composer&#x27;s idealised (and in the last movement caricatured) portrait of Harriet Smithson. Schumann wrote of the work that despite its apparent formlessness, &quot;there is an inherent symmetrical order corresponding to the great dimensions of the work, and this besides the inner connexions of thought&quot;, and in the 20th century Constant Lambert wrote, &quot;Formally speaking it is among the finest of 19th-century symphonies&quot;. The work has always been among Berlioz&#x27;s most popular.

&quot;Harold in Italy&quot;, despite its subtitle &quot;Symphony in four parts with viola principal&quot;, is described by the musicologist Mark Evan Bonds as a work traditionally seen as lacking any direct historical antecedent, &quot;a hybrid of symphony and concerto that owes little or nothing to the earlier, lighter genre of the symphonie concertante&quot;. In the 20th century critical opinion varied about the work, even among those well-disposed to Berlioz. Felix Weingartner, an early 20th-century champion of the composer, wrote in 1904 that it did not reach the level of the &quot;Symphonie fantastique&quot;; fifty years later Edward Sackville-West and Desmond Shawe-Taylor found it &quot;romantic and picturesque ... Berlioz at his best&quot;. In the 21st century Bonds ranks it among the greatest works of its kind in the 19th century.

The &quot;Dramatic Symphony&quot; with chorus, &quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot; (1839), is still further from the traditional symphonic model. The episodes of Shakespeare&#x27;s drama are represented in orchestral music, interspersed with expository and narrative sections for voices. Among Berlioz&#x27;s admirers the work divides opinion. Weingartner called it &quot;a style-less mixture of different forms; not quite oratorio, not quite opera, not quite symphony – fragments of all three, and nothing perfect&quot;. Countering accusations of lack of unity in this and other Berlioz works, Emmanuel Chabrier replied in a single emphatic word. Cairns regards the work as symphonic, albeit &quot;a bold extension&quot; of the genre, but he notes that other Berliozians including Wilfrid Mellers view it as &quot;a curious, not entirely convincing compromise between symphonic and operatic techniques&quot;. Rushton comments that &quot;pronounced unity&quot; is not among the virtues of the work, but he argues that to close one&#x27;s mind on that account is to miss all that the music has to give.

The last of the four symphonies is the &quot;Symphonie funebre et triomphale&quot;, for giant brass and woodwind band (1840), with string parts added later, together with optional chorus. The structure is more conventional than the instrumentation: the first movement is in sonata form, but there are only two other movements, and Berlioz did not adhere to the traditional relationship between the various keys of the piece. Wagner called the symphony &quot;popular in the most ideal sense ... every urchin in a blue blouse would thoroughly understand it&quot;.

===Operas===
None of Berlioz&#x27;s three completed operas were written to commission, and theatre managers were not enthusiastic about staging them. Cairns writes that unlike Meyerbeer, who was rich, influential, and deferred to by opera managements, Berlioz was &quot;an opera composer on sufferance, one who composed on borrowed time paid for with money that was not his but lent by a wealthy friend&quot;.

The three operas contrast strongly with one another. The first, &quot;Benvenuto Cellini&quot; (1838), inspired by the memoirs of the Florentine sculptor, is an opera semiseria, seldom staged until the 21st century, when there have been signs of a revival in its fortunes, with its first production at the Metropolitan Opera (2003) and a co-production by the English National Opera and the Opéra national de Paris (2014), but it remains the least often produced of the three operas. In 2008, the music critic Michael Quinn called it &quot;an opera overflowing in every way, with musical gold bursting from each curve and crevice ... a score of continually stupendous brilliance and invention&quot; but agreed with the general view of the libretto: &quot;incoherent ... episodic, too epic to be comedy, too ironic for tragedy&quot;. Berlioz welcomed Liszt&#x27;s help in revising the work, streamlining the confusing plot; for his other two operas he wrote his own libretti.

The epic &quot;Les Troyens&quot; (1858) is described by the musical scholar James Haar as &quot;incontestably Berlioz&#x27;s masterpiece&quot;, a view shared by many other writers. Berlioz based the text on Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;, depicting the fall of Troy and subsequent travels of the hero. Holoman describes the poetry of the libretto as old fashioned for its day, but effective and at times beautiful. The opera consists of a series of self-contained numbers, but they form a continuous narrative, with the orchestra playing a vital part in expounding and commenting on the action. Although the work plays for five hours (including intervals) it is no longer the normal practice to present it across two evenings. &quot;Les Troyens&quot;, in Holoman&#x27;s view, embodies the composer&#x27;s artistic creed: the union of music and poetry holds &quot;incomparably greater power than either art alone&quot;.

The last of Berlioz&#x27;s operas is the Shakespearean comedy &quot;Béatrice et Bénédict&quot; (1862), written, the composer said, as a relaxation after his efforts with &quot;Les Troyens&quot;. He described it as &quot;a caprice written with the point of a needle&quot;. His libretto, based on &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;, omits Shakespeare&#x27;s darker sub-plots and replaces the clowns Dogberry and Verges with an invention of his own, the tiresome and pompous music master Somarone. The action focuses on the sparring between the two leading characters, but the score contains some gentler music, such as the nocturne-duet &quot;Nuit paisible et sereine&quot;, the beauty of which, Cairns suggests, matches or surpasses the love music in &quot;Roméo&quot; or &quot;Les Troyens&quot;. Cairns writes that &quot;Béatrice et Bénédict&quot; &quot;has wit and grace and lightness of touch. It accepts life as it is. The opera is a divertissement, not a grand statement&quot;.

&quot;La Damnation de Faust&quot;, although not written for the theatre, is sometimes staged as an opera.

===Choral===

Berlioz gained a reputation, only partly justified, for liking gigantic orchestral and choral forces. In France there was a tradition of open-air performance, dating from the Revolution, calling for larger ensembles than were needed in the concert hall. Among the generation of French composers ahead of him, Cherubini, Méhul, Gossec and Berlioz&#x27;s teacher Le Sueur all wrote for huge forces on occasion, and in the Requiem and to a lesser degree the Te Deum Berlioz follows them, in his own manner. The Requiem calls for sixteen timpani, quadruple woodwind and twelve horns, but the moments when the full orchestral sound is unleashed are few – the Dies irae is one such – and most of the Requiem is notable for its restraint. The orchestra does not play at all in the &quot;Quaerens me&quot; section, and what Cairns calls &quot;the apocalyptic armoury&quot; is reserved for special moments of colour and emphasis: &quot;its purpose is not merely spectacular but architectural, to clarify the musical structure and open up multiple perspectives.&quot;

What Macdonald calls Berlioz&#x27;s monumental manner is more prominent in the &quot;Te Deum&quot;, composed in 1849 and first heard in 1855, when it was given in connection with the Exposition Universelle. By that time the composer had added to its two choruses a part for massed children&#x27;s voices, inspired by hearing a choir of 6,500 children singing in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral during his London trip in 1851. A cantata for double chorus and large orchestra in honour of Napoleon III, &quot;L&#x27;Impériale&quot;, described by Berlioz as &quot;en style énorme&quot;, was played several times at the 1855 exhibition, but has subsequently remained a rarity.

&quot;La Damnation de Faust&quot;, though conceived as a work for the concert hall, did not achieve success in France until it was staged as an opera long after the composer&#x27;s death. Within a year of Raoul Gunsbourg&#x27;s production of the piece at Monte Carlo in 1893 the work was presented as an opera in Italy, Germany, Britain, Russia and the US. The many elements of the work vary from the robust &quot;Hungarian March&quot; near the beginning to the delicate &quot;Dance of the Sylphs&quot;, the frenetic &quot;Ride to the Abyss&quot;, Méphistophélès&#x27; suave and seductive &quot;Song of the Devil&quot;, and Brander&#x27;s &quot;Song of a Rat&quot;, a requiem for a dead rodent.

&quot;L&#x27;Enfance du Christ&quot; (1850–1854) follows the pattern of &quot;La Damnation de Faust&quot; in mixing dramatic action and philosophic reflection. Berlioz, after a brief youthful religious spell, was a lifelong agnostic, but he was not hostile to the Roman Catholic church, and Macdonald calls the &quot;serenely contemplative&quot; end of the work &quot;the nearest Berlioz ever came to a devoutly Christian mode of expression&quot;.

===Mélodies===
Berlioz wrote songs throughout his career, but not prolifically. His best-known work in the genre is the song cycle &quot;Les Nuits d&#x27;été&quot;, a group of six songs, originally for voice and piano but now usually heard in its later orchestrated form. He suppressed some of his early songs, and his last publication, in 1865, was the &quot;33 Mélodies&quot;, collecting into one volume all his songs that he chose to preserve. Some of them, such as &quot;Hélène&quot; and &quot;Sara la baigneuse&quot;, exist in versions for four voices with accompaniment, and there are others for two or three voices. Berlioz later orchestrated some of the songs originally written with piano accompaniment, and some, such as &quot;Zaïde&quot; and &quot;Le Chasseur danois&quot; were written with alternative piano or orchestral parts. &quot;La Captive&quot;, to words by Victor Hugo, exists in six different versions. In its final version (1849) it was described by the Berlioz scholar Tom S. Wotton as like &quot;a miniature symphonic poem&quot;. The first version, written at the Villa Medici, had been in fairly regular rhythm, but for his revision Berlioz made the strophic outline less clear-cut, and added optional orchestral parts for the last stanza, which brings the song to a quiet close.

The songs remain on the whole among the least known of Berlioz&#x27;s works, and John Warrack suggests that Schumann identified why this might be so: the shape of the melodies is, as usual with Berlioz, not straightforward, and to those used to the regular four-bar phrases of French (or German) song this is an obstacle to appreciation. Warrack also comments that the piano parts, though not lacking in harmonic interest, are discernibly written by a non-pianist. Despite that, Warrack considers up to a dozen songs from the &quot;33 Mélodies&quot; well worth exploring – &quot;Among them are some masterpieces.&quot;

===Prose===

Berlioz&#x27;s literary output was considerable and mostly consists of music criticism. Some was collected and published in book form. His &quot;Treatise on Instrumentation&quot; (1844) began as a series of articles and remained a standard work on orchestration throughout the 19th century; when Richard Strauss was commissioned to revise it in 1905 he added new material but did not change Berlioz&#x27;s original text. The revised form remained widely used well into the 20th century; a new English translation was published in 1948.

Other selections from Berlioz&#x27;s press columns were published in &quot;Les Soirées de l&#x27;orchestre&quot; (Evenings with the Orchestra, 1852), &quot;Les Grotesques de la musique&quot; (1859) and &quot;À travers chants&quot; (Through Songs, 1862). His &quot;Mémoires&quot; were published posthumously in 1870. Macdonald comments that there are few facets of musical practice of the time untouched in Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;feuilletons&quot;. He professed to dislike writing his press pieces, and they undoubtedly took up time that he would have preferred to spend writing music. His excellence as a witty and perceptive critic may have worked to his disadvantage in another way: he became so well known to the French public in that capacity that his stature as a composer became correspondingly more difficult to establish.

==Reputation and Berlioz scholarship==

===Writers===

The first biography of Berlioz, by Eugène de Mirecourt, was published during the composer&#x27;s lifetime. Holoman lists six other French biographies of the composer published in the four decades after his death. Of those who wrote for and against Berlioz&#x27;s music in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, among the most outspoken were musical amateurs such as the lawyer and diarist George Templeton Strong, who called the composer&#x27;s music variously &quot;flatulent&quot;, &quot;rubbish&quot;, and &quot;the work of a tipsy chimpanzee&quot;, and, in the pro-Berlioz camp, the poet and journalist Walter J. Turner, who wrote what Cairns calls &quot;exaggerated eulogies&quot;. Like Strong, Turner was, in the words of the music critic Charles Reid, &quot;unhampered by any excess of technical knowledge&quot;.

Serious studies of Berlioz in the 20th century began with Adolphe Boschot&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Histoire d&#x27;un romantique&quot; (three volumes, 1906–1913). His successors were Tom S. Wotton, author of a 1935 biography, and Julien Tiersot, who wrote numerous scholarly articles on Berlioz and began the collection and editing of the composer&#x27;s letters, a process eventually completed in 2016, eighty years after Tiersot&#x27;s death. In the early 1950s the best-known Berlioz scholar was Jacques Barzun, a protégé of Wotton, and, like him, strongly hostile to many of Boschot&#x27;s conclusions, which they saw as unfairly critical of the composer. Barzun&#x27;s study was published in 1950. He was accused at the time by the musicologist Winton Dean of being excessively partisan, and refusing to admit failings and unevenness in Berlioz&#x27;s music; more recently he has been credited by the musicologist Nicholas Temperley with playing a major part in improving the climate of musical opinion towards Berlioz.

Since Barzun, the leading Berlioz scholars have included David Cairns, D. Kern Holoman, Hugh Macdonald and Julian Rushton. Cairns translated and edited Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;Mémoires&quot; in 1969, and published a two-volume, 1500-page study of the composer (1989 and 1999), described in &quot;Grove&#x27;s Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot; as &quot;one of the masterpieces of modern biography&quot;. Holoman was responsible for the publication in 1987 of the first thematic catalogue of Berlioz&#x27;s works; two years later he published a single-volume biography of the composer. Macdonald was appointed in 1967 as the inaugural general editor of the New Berlioz Edition published by Bärenreiter; 26 volumes were issued between 1967 and 2006 under his editorship. He is also one of the editors of Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;Correspondance générale&quot;, and author of a 1978 study of Berlioz&#x27;s orchestral music, and of the &quot;Grove&quot; article on the composer. Rushton has published two volumes of analyses of Berlioz&#x27;s music (1983 and 2001). The critic Rosemary Wilson said of his work, &quot;He has done more than any other writer to explain the uniqueness of Berlioz&#x27;s musical style without losing a sense of wonder in its originality of musical expression.&quot;

===Changing reputation===
Because few of Berlioz&#x27;s works were often performed in the late-19th and early 20th centuries, widely accepted views of his music were based on hearsay rather than on the music itself. Orthodox opinion emphasised supposed technical defects in the music and ascribed to the composer characteristics that he did not possess. Debussy called him &quot;a monster ... not a musician at all. He creates the illusion of music by means borrowed from literature and painting&quot;. In 1904, in the second edition of &quot;Grove&quot;, Henry Hadow made this judgment:

By the 1950s the critical climate was changing, although in 1954 the fifth edition of &quot;Grove&quot; carried this verdict from Léon Vallas:

Cairns dismisses the article as &quot;an astonishing anthology of all the nonsense that has ever been talked about [Berlioz]&quot;, but adds that by the 1960s it seemed a quaint survival from a vanished age. By 1963 Cairns, viewing Berlioz&#x27;s greatness as firmly established, felt able to advise anyone writing on the subject, &quot;Do not keep harping on the &#x27;strangeness&#x27; of Berlioz&#x27;s music; you will no longer carry the reader with you. And do not use phrases like &#x27;genius without talent&#x27;, &#x27;a certain strain of amateurishness&#x27;, &#x27;curiously uneven&#x27;: they have had their day.&quot;

One important reason for the steep rise in Berlioz&#x27;s reputation and popularity is the introduction of the LP record after the Second World War. In 1950 Barzun made the point that although Berlioz was praised by his artistic peers, including Schumann, Wagner, César Franck and Modest Mussorgsky, the public had heard little of his music until recordings became widely available. Barzun maintained that many myths had grown up about the supposed quirkiness or ineptitude of the music – myths that were dispelled once the works were finally made available for all to hear. Neville Cardus made a similar point in 1955. As more and more Berlioz works became widely available on record, professional musicians and critics, and the musical public, were for the first time able to judge for themselves.

A milestone in the reappraisal of Berlioz&#x27;s reputation came in 1957, when for the first time a professional opera company staged the original version of &quot;The Trojans&quot; in a single evening. It was at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden; the work was sung in English with some minor cuts, but its importance was internationally recognised, and led to the world premiere staging of the work uncut and in French, at Covent Garden in 1969, marking the centenary of the composer&#x27;s death.

In recent decades Berlioz has been widely regarded as a great composer, prone to lapses like any other. In 1999 the composer and critic Bayan Northcott wrote that the work of Cairns, Rushton, Sir Colin Davis and others retained &quot;the embattled conviction of a cause&quot;. Nevertheless, Northcott was writing about Davis&#x27;s &quot;Berlioz Odyssey&quot; of seventeen concerts of Berlioz&#x27;s music, featuring all the major works, a prospect unimaginable in earlier decades of the century. Northcott concluded, &quot;Berlioz still seems so immediate, so controversial, so ever-new&quot;.

==Recordings==
All of Berlioz&#x27;s major works and most of his minor ones have been commercially recorded. This is a comparatively recent development. In the mid-1950s the international record catalogues listed complete recordings of seven major works: the &quot;Symphonie fantastique&quot;, &quot;Symphonie funèbre et triomphale&quot;, &quot;Harold in Italy&quot;, &quot;Les Nuits d&#x27;été&quot;, &quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot;, the Requiem and the Te Deum, and various overtures. Excerpts from &quot;Les Troyens&quot; were available but there were no complete recordings of the operas.

Recordings conducted by Colin Davis are prominent in the Berlioz discography, some studio-made and others recorded live. The first was &quot;L&#x27;Enfance du Christ&quot; in 1960 and the last the Requiem in 2012. In between there were five recordings of &quot;Les Nuits d&#x27;été&quot;, four each of &quot;Béatrice et Bénédict&quot;, the &quot;Symphonie fantastique&quot; and &quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot;, and three of &quot;Harold in Italy&quot;, &quot;Les Troyens&quot;, and &quot;La Damnation de Faust&quot;.

In addition to Davis&#x27;s versions, &quot;Les Troyens&quot; has received studio recordings under Charles Dutoit and John Nelson; Nelson and Daniel Barenboim have recorded versions of &quot;Béatrice et Bénédict&quot;, and Nelson and Roger Norrington have conducted &quot;Benvenuto Cellini&quot; for CD. Singers who have recorded &quot;Les Nuits d&#x27;été&quot; include Victoria de los Ángeles, Leontyne Price, Janet Baker, Régine Crespin, Jessye Norman and Kiri Te Kanawa, and more recently, Karen Cargill and Susan Graham.

By far the most recorded of Berlioz&#x27;s works is the &quot;Symphonie fantastique&quot;. The discography of the British Hector Berlioz website lists 96 recordings, from the pioneering version by Gabriel Pierné and the Concerts Colonne in 1928 to those conducted by Beecham, Pierre Monteux, Charles Munch, Herbert von Karajan and Otto Klemperer to more recent versions including those of Boulez, Marc Minkowski, Yannick Nézet-Séguin and François-Xavier Roth.

<doc id="53427" wikidata="Q151794" url="?curid=53427" title="Kenzō Tange">
<text>was a Japanese architect and winner of the 1987 Pritzker Prize for Architecture. He was one of the most significant architects of the 20th century, combining traditional Japanese styles with modernism, and designed major buildings on five continents. His career spanned the entire second half of the twentieth century, producing numerous distinctive buildings in Tokyo, other cities both in Japan and around the world, as well as ambitious physical plans for Tokyo and its environments. 

Tange was also an influential patron of the Metabolist movement. Influenced from an early age by the Swiss modernist Le Corbusier, Tange gained international recognition in 1949 when he won the competition for the design of Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park. He was a member of CIAM (Congres Internationaux d&#x27;Architecture Moderne) in the 1950s. 

Tange handled urban redevelopment projects after World War II. His ideas were explored in designs for Tokyo and Skopje. Tange&#x27;s work influenced a generation of architects across the world.

==Early life==
Born on 4 September 1913 in Sakai, Japan, Tange spent his early life in the Chinese cities of Hankou and Shanghai; he and his family returned to Japan after learning of the death of one of his uncles. In contrast to the green lawns and red bricks in their Shanghai abode, the Tange family took up residence in a thatched roof farmhouse in Imabari on the island of Shikoku.

After finishing middle school, Tange moved to Hiroshima in 1930 to attend high school. It was here that he first encountered the works of Swiss modernist, Le Corbusier. His discovery of the drawings of the Palace of the Soviets in a foreign art journal convinced him to become an architect. Although he graduated from high school, Tange&#x27;s poor results in mathematics and physics meant that he had to pass entrance exams to qualify for admission to the prestigious universities. He spent two years doing so and during that time, he read extensively about western philosophy. Tange also enrolled in the film division at Nihon University&#x27;s art department to dodge Japan&#x27;s drafting of young men to its military and seldom attended classes.

In 1935 Tange began the tertiary studies he desired at University of Tokyo&#x27;s architecture department. He studied under Hideto Kishida and Yoshikazu Uchida. Although Tange was fascinated by the photographs of Katsura villa that sat on Kishida&#x27;s desk, his work was inspired by Le Corbusier. His graduation project was a seventeen-hectare (42-acre) development set in Tokyo&#x27;s Hibiya Park.

==Early career==
After graduating from the university, Tange started to work as an architect at the office of Kunio Maekawa. During his employment, he travelled to Manchuria, participating in an architectural design competition for a bank, and toured Japanese-occupied Rehe on his return. When the Second World War started, he left Maekawa to rejoin the University of Tokyo as a postgraduate student. He developed an interest in urban design, and referencing only the resources available in the university library, he embarked on a study of Greek and Roman marketplaces. In 1942, Tange entered a competition for the design of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere Memorial Hall. He was awarded first prize for a design that would have been situated at the base of Mount Fuji; the hall he conceived was a fusion of Shinto shrine architecture and the plaza on Capitoline Hill in Rome. The design was not realised.

In 1946, Tange became an assistant professor at the university and opened Tange Laboratory. In 1963, he was promoted to professor of the Department of Urban Engineering. His students included Sachio Otani, Kisho Kurokawa, Arata Isozaki, Hajime Yatsuka and Fumihiko Maki.

==Post war reconstruction==

Tange&#x27;s interest in urban studies put him in a good position to handle post war reconstruction. In the summer of 1946 he was invited by the War Damage Rehabilitation Board to put forward a proposal for certain war damaged cities. He submitted plans for Hiroshima and Maebashi. His design for an airport in Kanon, Hiroshima was accepted and built, but a seaside park in Ujina was not.

The Hiroshima authorities took advice about the city&#x27;s reconstruction from foreign consultants, and in 1947 Tam Deling, an American park planner, suggested they build a Peace Memorial and preserve buildings situated near ground zero, that point directly below the explosion of the atomic bomb. In 1949 the authorities enacted the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Reconstruction Act, which gave the city access to special grant aid, and in August 1949, an international competition was announced for the design of the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park.

Tange was awarded first prize for a design that proposed a museum whose axis runs through the park, intersecting Peace Boulevard and the atomic bomb dome. The building is raised on massive columns, which frame the view along the structure&#x27;s axis.

==Projects==
===Peace Center in Hiroshima===
Work on the Peace Center commenced in 1950. In addition to the axial nature of the design, the layout is similar to Tange&#x27;s early competition arrangement for the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere Memorial Hall.

In the initial design the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum was dominated by adjoining utility buildings, which were linked to it by high-level walkways. Tange refined this concept to place the museum prominently at the centre, separate from the utility buildings (only one of which was subsequently designed by him). In addition to architectural symbolism, he thought it important for the design to centre around the building that houses the information about the atomic explosion.

The museum is constructed from bare reinforced concrete. The primary museum floor is lifted six metres above the ground on huge piloti and is accessible via a free-standing staircase. The rhythmical facade comprises vertical elements that repeat outwards from the centre. Like the exterior, the interior is finished with rough concrete; the idea was to keep the surfaces plain so that nothing could distract the visitor from the contents of the exhibits.

The Peace Plaza is the backdrop for the museum. The plaza was designed to allow 50 thousand people to gather around the peace monument in the centre. Tange also designed the Cenotaph monument as an arch composed of two hyperbolic paraboloids, said to be based on traditional Japanese ceremonial tombs from the Kofun Period.

===Ise Shrine===

In 1953, Tange and architectural journalist and critic Noboru Kawazoe were invited to attend the reconstruction of the Ise Grand Shrine. The shrine is rebuilt every 20 years, and in 1953, it marked the 59th iteration of this tradition, which began in 690 by the order of Emperor Temmu. Normally the reconstruction process was a very closed affair but this time the ceremony was opened to architects and journalists to document the event. The ceremony coincided with the end of the American Occupation and it seemed to symbolise a new start in Japanese architecture. In 1965 when Tange and Kawazoe published the book &quot;Ise: Prototype of Japanese Architecture&quot;, he likened the building to a modernist structure: an honest expression of materials, a functional design and prefabricated elements.

===Kagawa Prefectural Government Hall===
The Kagawa Prefectural Government Hall on the island of Shikoku was completed in 1958. Its expressive construction could be likened to the Daibutsu style seen at the Tōdai-ji in Nara. The columns on the elevation bore only vertical loads so Tange was able to design them to be thin, maximising the surfaces for glazing. Although the hall has been called one of his finest projects, it drew criticism at the time of its construction for relying too heavily on tradition.

===Tange&#x27;s own home===
Tange&#x27;s own home, designed in 1951 and completed in 1953, uses a similar skeleton structure raised off the ground as the Hiroshima Peace Museum; however, it is fused with a more traditional Japanese design that uses timber and paper. The house is based on the traditional Japanese module of the tatami mat, with the largest rooms designed to have flexibility so that they can be separated into three smaller rooms by fusuma sliding doors. The facade is designed with a rhythmic pattern; it comprises two types of facade designs (&quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;) that are ordered laterally in an a-b-a-a-b-a arrangement. The house is topped with a two-tier roof. Kazuo Shinohara&#x27;s 1954 house at Kugayama is remarkably similar in its design, although it is built with steel and has a simpler rhythm in its facade.

===Town Hall, Kurashiki===

The fortress-like town hall in Kurashiki was designed in 1958 and completed in 1960. When it was constructed it was situated on the edge of the old town centre connecting it with the newer areas of the town. Kurashiki is better known as a tourist spot for its old Machiya style houses.

Set in an open square, the building sits on massive columns that taper inwards as they rise. The elevation consists of horizontal planks (some of which are omitted to create windows) which overlap at the corners in a &quot;log cabin&quot; effect. The entrance is covered with a heavy projecting concrete canopy which leads to a monumental entrance hall. The stair to this hall ascends in cantilevered straight flights to the left and right. The walls to this interior are bare shuttered concrete punctured by windows reminiscent of Le Corbusier&#x27;s La Tourette. The Council Chamber is a separate building whose raked roof has seating on top of it to form an external performance space.

===St. Mary&#x27;s Cathedral===
St. Mary&#x27;s Cathedral (in Japanese: 東京カテドラル聖マリア大聖堂, romanized: Tōkyō katedoraru sei Maria daiseidō) is the seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Tokyo. St. Mary&#x27;s Cathedral is located in the Sekiguchi neighborhood of Bunkyo, Tokyo, Japan The original wooden structure, constructed in 1899 in the Gothic style, was destroyed during the air raids on Tokyo during World War II. The present church, designed by Kenzo Tange, was inaugurated in December, 1964.

===Tokyo Olympic arenas===

The Yoyogi National Gymnasium is situated in an open area in Yoyogi Park on an adjacent axis to the Meiji Shrine. The gymnasium and swimming pool were designed by Tange for the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, which were the first Olympics held in Asia. Tange began his designs in 1961 and the plans were approved by the Ministry of Education in January 1963. The buildings were placed to optimize space available for parking and to permit the smoothest transition of incoming and outgoing people.

Inspired by the skyline of the Colosseum in Rome, the roofs have a skin suspended from two masts. The buildings were inspired by Le Corbusier&#x27;s Philips Pavilion designed for Brussels&#x27; World Fair, and the Ingalls Rink, Yale University&#x27;s hockey area, by Eero Saarinen (both structures were completed in 1958). The roof of the Philips Pavilion was created by complex hyperbolic paraboloid surfaces stretched between cables. In both cases Tange took Western ideas and adapted them to meet Japanese requirements.

The gymnasium has a capacity of approximately 16,000 and the smaller building can accommodate up to 5,300 depending on the events that are taking place. At the time it was built, the gymnasium had the world&#x27;s largest suspended roof span. Two reinforced concrete pillars support a pre-stressed steel net onto which steel plates are attached. The bottom anchoring of this steel net is a heavy concrete support system which forms a distinct curve on the interior and exterior of the building. In the interior, this structural anchor is used to support the grandstand seats. The overall curvature of the roof helps protect the building from the damaging effects of strong winds.

Tange won a Pritzker Prize for the design; the citation described the gymnasium as &quot;among the most beautiful buildings of the 20th century&quot;.

=== Plan for Skopje ===

The reconstruction plan of the capital city of Skopje, then part of the Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia following a major earthquake was won by Tange&#x27;s architecture team in 1965. The project was significant because of its international influence, however for Tange it was model case for urban reconstruction to realise modern architecture principles. It is the first time that a Japanese architect was invited by an international body to participate in an urban development of this scale.

===Supreme Court Building of Pakistan===

The Supreme Court of Pakistan Building is the official and principal workplace of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, located in 44000 Constitution Avenue Islamabad, Pakistan. Completed in 1993, it is flanked by the Prime Minister&#x27;s Secretariat to the south and President&#x27;s House and the Parliament Building to the north.

Designed by Tange, to a design brief prepared by the PEPAC, the complex was engineered and built by CDA Engineering and Siemens Engineering.

===Osaka Exposition 1970===

In 1965 the Bureau International des Expositions decided that Japan should host the 1970 Exposition. of land in the Senri Hills near Osaka were put aside for its use. Tange and Uzo Nishiyama were appointed as planners for the masterplan by the Theme Committee. Tange assembled a group of twelve architects to design the infrastructure and facilities for the Expo.

At the centre of the Expo was the Festival Plaza. Tange conceived that this plaza (with its oversailing space frame roof) would connect the display spaces and create a setting for a &quot;festival&quot;. The plaza divided the site into a northern zone for pavilions and a southern zone for administration facilities. The zones were interconnected with moving pathways.

=== Singapore ===

In 1970, he became acquainted with Lee Kuan Yew while staying in Hong Kong to receive an honorary degree from the University of Hong Kong. Singapore had gained independence only five years earlier and was rapidly developing its small territory. They got on well, and Tange was soon invited to serve as an advisor to the urban planning arm of the Singaporean government. Initially, he gave advice on what should be preserved and what should be rebuilt, and he also planned the development of a reclaimed area, Marina South.

In the 1980s, Tange designed the main campus layout and building complex of the newly established Nanyang Technological University. He also defined the skyline of the Central Business District by designing iconic buildings such as One Raffles Place (the tallest building outside the United States upon its completion), the Pickering Operations Complex, and UOB Plaza in the 1980s and 1990s. He also designed Singapore Indoor Stadium.

=== Hawaii Hochi Building ===
Started in 1972 and completed in 1975 for &quot;Hawaii Hochi&quot;, a Japanese language newspaper founded in 1912. The brutalist building was one of only two buildings Tange designed for construction in the United States. The building features two structures connected by an open air courtyard with tropical plants, and a rooftop parking lot.

=== Syria Presidential Palace === 

In 1975, while Hafez al-Assad was still in power, Tange began designing the Presidential Palace in Damascus, Syria. According to a 2013 article by The Guardian, Tange resigned before construction began, and his original design was &quot;reinterpreted&quot; by others. The resulting compound ultimately enclosed 31,500 square metres (340,000 square feet) of space.

==Architectural circle==

===Congrès International d&#x27;Architecture Moderne===
Tange&#x27;s first placing in the design competition for the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park gained him recognition from Kunio Maekawa. The elder architect invited Tange to attend the Congrès International d&#x27;Architecture Moderne (CIAM). Founded in 1928, this organization of planners and architects had initially promoted architecture in economic and social context, but at its fourth meeting in 1933 (under the direction of Le Corbusier) it debated the notion of the &quot;Functional City&quot;. This led to a series of proposals on urban planning known as &quot;The Athens Charter&quot;. By the 1951 CIAM meeting that was held in Hoddesdon, England, to which Tange was invited, the Athens Charter came under debate by younger members of the group (including Tange) who found the Charter too vague in relation to city expansion. The &quot;Athens Charter&quot; promoted the idea that a city gains character from its continual changes over many years; this notion was written before the advent of mass bombings and the Second World War and therefore held little meaning for Tange who had evidenced the destruction of Hiroshima. The discussions at Hoddesdon sowed discontent within CIAM that eventually contributed to its breakup after their Dubrovnik meeting in 1956; the younger members of CIAM formed a splinter group known as Team X, which Tange later joined. Tange presented various designs to Team X in their meetings. At a 1959 meeting in Otterlo, Holland, one of his presentations included an unrealised project by Kiyonori Kikutake; this project became the basis of the Metabolist Movement.

When Tange travelled back to Japan from the 1951 CIAM meeting, he visited Le Corbusier&#x27;s nearly complete Unité d&#x27;Habitation in Marseilles, France. He also looked at the sketches for the new capital of Punjab at Chandigarh, India.

===Tokyo World Design Conference and urban planning===

Tange had left the Team X Otterlo conference early to take up a tenure at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His experiences at the conference may have led him to set his fifth year students a project to design a 25-thousand-person residential community to be erected in Boston over the bay. The scheme comprised two giant A-frame structures that resembled Tange&#x27;s competition entry for the World Health Organisation&#x27;s headquarters on Lake Geneva. Both this scheme and the earlier ones by Kikutake formed the basis of Tange&#x27;s speech to the Tokyo World Design Conference in 1960. In his speech he used words such as &quot;cell&quot; and &quot;metabolism&quot; in relation to urban design. The Metabolist movement grew out of discussions with other members of the conference. Amongst them were Kisho Kurokawa, Junzo Sakakura, Alison and Peter Smithson, Louis Kahn, Jean Prouvé, B. V. Doshi and Jacob Bakema. The conference ended with Tange&#x27;s presentation of the Boston plan and his own scheme, &quot;The Tokyo Plan – 1960&quot;.

Tange argued that the normal urban pattern of a radial centripetal transportation system was a relic of the Middle Ages and would not handle the strain placed upon it by the world&#x27;s mega cities, which he qualified as those with populations greater than 10 million. Rather than building up a city from a civic centre, Tange&#x27;s proposal was based on civic axis, developing the city in a linear fashion. Three levels of traffic, graded according to speed, would facilitate the movement of up to 2.5 million people along the axis, which would be divided into vertebrae-like cyclical transportation elements. The sheer size of the proposal meant that it would stretch out across the water of Tokyo Bay. Tange&#x27;s proposals at this conference play a large part in establishing his reputation as &quot;The West&#x27;s favourite Japanese architect&quot;.

In 1965 Tange was asked by the United Nations to enter a limited competition for the redevelopment of Skopje, which was at that time a city of Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The town had been heavily destroyed by an earthquake in 1963. Tange won 60% of the prize; the other 40% was awarded to the Yugoslav team. Tange&#x27;s design furthered ideas put forward in the earlier &quot;Tokyo Plan&quot;.

Tange further developed his ideas for expandable urban forms in 1966 when he designed the Yamanashi Broadcasting and Press Centre in Kōfu. It was designed for three media companies: a newspaper printing plant, a radio station and a television studio. To allow for future expansion Tange grouped the similar functions of three offices together in three zones. The newspaper printing machinery was on the ground floor, sealed studios on the upper floors and offices on glass walled floors surrounded by balconies. The services, including stairs and lifts, are housed in 16 reinforced concrete columns that are of five-metre (17 ft) diameter. Space was left between the cluster of functional space to allow for future expansion, although these have been used for gardens and terraces.

===Urbanists and Architects Team===
Tange&#x27;s inspiration for his design office came from his friend Walter Gropius who he had first met at the CIAM meeting in 1951. While lecturing at the Bauhaus, Gropius had placed great importance on teaching architects, especially imparting on them the concept of working together as a team. The Urbanists and Architects Team was founded in 1961 and became Kenzō Tange Associates. Tange promoted a very flat hierarchy in the practice: partners were equal in importance and were encouraged to participate in every project. Multiple options were developed simultaneously, and research on individual schemes was encouraged.

==Later career==

During the 1970s and 1980s Tange expanded his portfolio to include buildings in over 20 countries around the world. In 1985, at the behest of Jacques Chirac, the mayor of Paris at that time, Tange proposed a master plan for a plaza at Place d&#x27;Italie that would interconnect the city along an east-west axis.

For the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building, which opened in 1991, Tange designed a large civic centre with a plaza dominated by two skyscrapers. These house the administration offices whilst a smaller seven-storey building contains assembly facilities. In his design of a high tech version of Kofu Communications Centre, Tange equipped all three buildings with state-of-the-art building management systems that monitored air quality, light levels and security. The external skin of the building makes dual references to both tradition and the modern condition. Tange incorporated vertical and horizontal lines reminiscent of both timber boarding and the lines on semiconductor boards.

Tange converted to Christianity, taking the name Joseph, the husband of Mary mother of Christ, some time before his death. He continued to practice until three years before his death in 2005. He disliked postmodernism in the 1980s and considered this style of architecture to be only &quot;transitional architectural expressions&quot;. His funeral was held in one of his works, the Tokyo Cathedral.

==Legacy==

The modular expansion of Tange&#x27;s Metabolist visions had some influence on Archigram with their plug-in mega structures. The Metabolist movement gave momentum to Kikutake&#x27;s career. Although his Marine City proposals (submitted by Tange at CIAM) were not realised, his Miyakonojo City Hall (1966) was a more Metabolist example of Tange&#x27;s own Nichinan Cultural Centre (1962). Although the Osaka Expo had marked a decline in the Metabolist movement, it resulted in a &quot;handing over&quot; of the reigns to a younger generation of architects such as Kazuo Shinohara and Arata Isozaki.

In an interview with Jeremy Melvin at the Royal Academy of Arts, Kengo Kuma explained that, at the age of ten, he was inspired to become an architect after seeing Tange&#x27;s Olympic arenas, which were constructed in 1964.

For Reyner Banham, Tange was a prime exemplar of the use of Brutalist architecture. His use of Béton brut concrete finishes in a raw and undecorated way combined with his civic projects such as the redevelopment of Tokyo Bay made him a great influence on British architects during the 1960s. Brutalist architecture has been criticised for being soulless and for promoting the exclusive use of a material that is poor at withstanding long exposures to natural weather.

He received the AIA Gold Medal in 1966.

Tange&#x27;s son Paul Noritaka Tange graduated from Harvard University in 1985 and went on to join Kenzō Tange Associates. He became the president of Kenzo Tange Associates in 1997 before founding Tange Associates in 2002.

<text>A nickname, in some circumstances also known as a sobriquet, or informally &quot;a moniker&quot;, is an informal substitute for the proper name of a person, place, or thing, used to express affection, playfulness, contempt, or a particular character trait. It is distinct from a pseudonym, stage name, or title, although the concepts can overlap.

== Etymology ==
The compound word &quot;ekename&quot;, meaning &quot;additional name&quot;, was attested as early as 1303. This word was derived from the Old English word &quot;eac&quot;, meaning &quot;also&quot;, related to &quot;eacian&quot;, meaning &quot;to increase&quot;. By the 15th century, the misdivision of the syllables of the phrase &quot;an ekename&quot; led to its rephrasing as &quot;a nekename&quot;. Though the spelling has changed, the meaning of the word has remained relatively stable ever since.

== Various language conventions ==
English nicknames are generally represented in quotes between the bearer&#x27;s first and last names (e.g., &quot;Dwight David &quot;Ike&quot; Eisenhower&quot; and &quot;Daniel Lamont &quot;Bubba&quot; Franks&quot;). It is also common for the nickname to be identified after a comma following the full real name or later in the body of the text, such as in an obituary (e.g., &quot;Frankie Frisch, &quot;The Fordham Flash&quot;&quot;). Any middle name is generally omitted, especially in speech. Like English, German uses (German-style) quotation marks between the first and last names (e.g., &quot;Andreas Nikolaus „Niki“ Lauda&quot;). Other languages may use other conventions; for example, Italian writes the nickname after the full name followed by &quot;detto&quot; &quot;called&quot; (e.g., &quot;Salvatore Schillaci detto Totò&quot;), in Spanish the nickname is written in formal contexts at the end in quotes following &quot;alias&quot; (e.g. &quot;Alfonso Tostado, alias «el Abulense»&quot;), in Portuguese the nickname is written after the full name followed by &quot;vulgo&quot; or between parenthesis (e.g. Edson Arantes do Nascimento, vulgo Pelé / Edson Arantes do Nascimento (Pelé)) and Slovenian represents nicknames after a dash or hyphen (e.g., &quot;Franc Rozman – Stane&quot;). The latter may confuse because it resembles an English convention sometimes used for married and maiden names.

== Various societal uses ==

In Viking societies, many people had &quot;heiti&quot;, &quot;viðrnefni&quot;, or &quot;kenningarnöfn&quot; (Old Norse terms for nicknames) which were used in addition to, or instead of, the first name. In some circumstances, the giving of a nickname had a special status in Viking society in that it created a relationship between the name maker and the recipient of the nickname, to the extent that the creation of a nickname also often entailed a formal ceremony and an exchange of gifts known in Old Norse as &quot;nafnfestr&quot; (&#x27;fastening a name&#x27;).

In Bengali society, for example, people will often have two names: a &quot;daknam&quot; (pet name) which is the name used by family and friends and a &quot;bhalonam&quot; which is their formal name.

In England, some surnames have nicknames traditionally attached. A man with the surname &#x27;Clark&#x27; will be nicknamed &#x27;Nobby&#x27;; the surname &#x27;Miller&#x27; will have the nickname &#x27;Dusty&#x27; (alluding to the flour dust of a miller at work); the surname &#x27;Adams&#x27; has the nickname &#x27;Nabby&#x27;. Several other nicknames are linked traditionally with surnames, including Chalky White, Bunny Warren, Tug Wilson, and Spud Baker. Other English nicknames allude to a person&#x27;s origins. A Scotsman may be nicknamed &#x27;Jock&#x27;, an Irishman &#x27;Paddy&#x27; (alluding to Saint Patrick, the patron saint of Ireland), or &#x27;Mick&#x27; (alluding to the preponderance of Roman Catholicism in Ireland), and a Welshman may be nicknamed &#x27;Taffy&#x27; (from Welsh &quot;Dafydd&quot;, David). Some nicknames referred ironically to a person&#x27;s physical characteristics, such as &#x27;Lofty&#x27; for a short person, &#x27;Curly&#x27; for a bald man, or &#x27;Bluey&#x27; for a redhead.

In Chinese culture, nicknames are frequently used within a community among relatives, friends, and neighbors. A typical southern Chinese nickname often begins with a &quot;阿&quot; followed by another character, usually the last character of the person&#x27;s given name. For example, Taiwanese politician Chen Shui-bian (陳水扁) is sometimes referred as &quot;阿扁&quot; (A-Bian). In many Chinese communities of Southeast Asia, nicknames may also connote one&#x27;s occupation or status. For example, the landlord might be known simply as &quot;Towkay&quot; (), Hokkien for &quot;boss&quot;) to his tenants or workers, while a bread seller would be called &quot;Mianbao Shu&quot; 面包叔 (literally, Uncle Bread).

== Computing ==
In the context of information technology, &quot;nickname&quot; is a common synonym for the &quot;screen name&quot; or &quot;handle&quot; of a user. In computer networks it has become a common practice for every person to also have one or more nicknames for pseudonymity, to avoid ambiguity, or simply because the natural name or technical address would be too long to type or take too much space on the screen.

In the IRC (Internet Relay Chat) text-based messaging system first developed in the late 1980s, a nickname (or &quot;nick&quot;) was required for every client that connected to an IRC server. 

== People ==
Nicknames are usually applied to a person and they are not always chosen by the recipient themselves. Some nicknames are derogatory name calls.

=== Abbreviation or modification ===
A nickname can be a shortened or a modified variation on a person&#x27;s real name.
* Contractions of longer names: Margaret to Greta.
* Initials: using the first letters of a person&#x27;s first, middle and/or last name, e.g. &quot;DJ&quot; for Daniel James.
* Dropping letters: with many nicknames, one or more letters, often R, are dropped: Fanny from Frances, Walt from Walter.
* Phonetic spelling: sometimes a nickname is created through the phonetic spelling of a name: Len from Leonard.
* Letter swapping: during the Middle Ages, the letter R would often be swapped for either L or D: Hal from Harry (which in turn comes from Henry); Molly from Mary; Sadie from Sarah; Hob, Dob, Rob, Bob, and Nob from Robert; Rick, Dick, and Hick from Richard; Bill from Will (which in turn comes from William); and Peg and Meg from Margaret. In the 19th-century frontier United States, Mary and Molly were often given the nickname Polly.

=== Name portions ===
* Front of a name. Sometimes a nickname can come from the beginning of a given name: Al from Alan/Allan/Albert/Alfonse/Alfred/Alden/Alexander, Art from Arthur, Chris from Christopher/Christina; Dot from Dorothy, Ed from Edward, Edmond, Edgar or Edwin, Iz or Izzy from Isaac, Isaiah, Isidore, Isabel, or Isabella; Joe or Jo from Joseph, Josephine, or Joanna.
* End of name: Drew from Andrew; Xander from Alexander; Enzo or Renzo from Lorenzo; Beth from Elizabeth; Bel, Bell, Bella or Belle from Isabelle/Isabella.
* Middle of name: Liz from Elizabeth; Tori from Victoria; Del or Della from Adelaide.
* Addition of diminutives: before the 17th century, most nicknames in English had the diminutive ending &quot;-in&quot; or &quot;-kin&quot;, where the ending was attached to the first syllable: thus Walter → Wat → Watkin, Robert → Rob → Hob → Hobkin, Thomas → Tom → Tomkin. While most of these have died away, a few remain, such as Robert → Rob → Robin, Henry → Henkin → Hank, John → Jankin → Jack, and Nicolas → Colin.
* Many nicknames drop the final one or two letters and add either ie/ee/y as a diminutive ending: Penny from Penelope, Edie from Edith, Davy from David, Charlie from Charles, Mikey from Michael, Jimmy from James, and Marty from Martin.
* Initialization, which forms a nickname from a person&#x27;s initials: A. E. Housman from Alfred Edward Housman, or Dubya for George W. Bush, a Texan pronunciation of the name of the letter &#x27;W&#x27;, President Bush&#x27;s middle initial. Brazilian striker Ronaldo was given the nickname R9 (initial and shirt number).
* Nicknames are sometimes based on a person&#x27;s last name (&quot;Tommo&quot; for Bill Thompson, &quot;Campo&quot; for David Campese) or a combination of first and last name such as &quot;A-Rod&quot; for Alex Rodriguez).
* Loose ties to a person&#x27;s name with an attached suffix: Gazza for English footballer Paul Gascoigne (though used more widely in Australia for Gary) and similar &quot;zza&quot; forms (Hezza, Prezza, etc.) for other prominent personalities whose activities are frequently reported in the British press (see also Oxford &quot;-er&quot; for a similar but wider phenomenon).
* Use of the second name.
* Use of the generational suffix, like &quot;Junior&quot;, or nicknames associated with a particular generational suffix, like Trey or Tripp for &quot;III&quot;.
* Combination of the first and middle name, or variations of a person&#x27;s first and middle name. For example, a person may have the name Mary Elizabeth but has the nickname &quot;Maz&quot; or &quot;Miz&quot; by combining Mary and Liz.
* Doubling of part of a first name. For example, forming &quot;NatNat&quot; from Nathan/Natasha or &quot;JamJam&quot; from James.

=== Relationship ===
A nickname may refer to the relationship with the person. This is a term of endearment.
* In Japanese culture, Japanese honorifics are designed so that a term of endearment conveys the exact status of the relationship between two people. Recipients are allowed to restrict use to a certain person.

== Geography ==
=== Placenames ===

Many geographical places have titles, or alternative names, which have positive implications. Paris, for example, is the &quot;City of Light&quot;, Rome is the &quot;Eternal City&quot;, Venice is &quot;La Serenissima&quot;, and New Jersey is the &quot;Garden State&quot;. These alternative names are often used to boost the status of such places, contrary to the usual role of a nickname. Many places or communities, particularly in the US, adopt titles because they can help in establishing a civic identity, help outsiders recognize a community or attract people to a community, promote civic pride, and build community unity. Titles and slogans that successfully create a new community &quot;ideology or myth&quot; are also believed to have economic value. Their economic value is difficult to measure, but there are anecdotal reports of cities that have achieved substantial economic benefits by &quot;branding&quot; themselves by adopting new slogans.

By contrast, older city nicknames may be critical: London is still occasionally referred to as &quot;The Smoke&quot; in memory of its notorious &quot;pea-souper&quot; smogs (smoke-filled fogs) of the 19th and early 20th centuries, and Edinburgh was &quot;Auld Reekie&quot; for the same reason, as countless coal fires polluted its atmosphere.

=== Residents ===
Besides or replacing the demonym, some places have collective nicknames for their inhabitants. Many examples of this practice are found in Wallonia and in Belgium in general, where such a nickname is referred to in French as &quot;blason populaire&quot;.

<doc id="53435" wikidata="Q151952" url="?curid=53435" title="Venus de Milo">
<text>The Venus de Milo or Aphrodite of Melos is an ancient Greek marble sculpture that was created during the Hellenistic period. Its exact dating is uncertain, but the modern consensus places it in the 2nd century BC, perhaps between 160 and 110 BC. It was rediscovered in 1820 on the island of Milos, Greece, and has been displayed at the Louvre Museum since 1821. Since the statue&#x27;s discovery, it has become one of the most famous works of ancient Greek sculpture in the world.

The &quot;Venus de Milo&quot; is believed to depict Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love, whose Roman counterpart was Venus. Made of Parian marble, the statue is larger than life size, standing over high. The statue is missing both arms. The original position of these missing arms is uncertain. The sculpture was originally identified as depicting Aphrodite holding the apple of discord as a marble hand holding an apple was found alongside it; recent scientific analysis supports the identification of this hand as part of the sculpture. On the basis of a now-lost inscription found near the sculpture, it has been attributed to Alexandros from Antioch on the Maeander, though the name on the inscription is uncertain and its connection to the Venus is disputed.

The &quot;Venus de Milo&quot; rapidly became a cornerstone of the Louvre&#x27;s antiquities collection in the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars, and its fame spread through distribution in photographs and three-dimensional copies. The statue inspired over 70 poems, influenced 19th-century art and the Surrealist movement in the early 20th century, and has been featured in various modern artistic projects, including film and advertising. In contrast to the popular appreciation of the sculpture, scholars have been more critical. Though upon its discovery the Venus was considered a classical masterpiece, since it was re-dated to the Hellenistic period classicists have neglected the Venus in favour of studying sculptures mentioned in ancient written sources, even though they only survive as later copies which are technically inferior to the Venus.

==Description==
The &quot;Venus de Milo&quot; is an over tall Parian marble statue of a Greek goddess, most likely Aphrodite, depicted with a bare torso and drapery over the lower half of her body. The figure stands with her weight on her right leg, and the left leg raised; her head is turned to the left. The statue is missing both arms, the left foot, and the earlobes. There is a filled hole below her right breast that originally contained a metal tenon that would have supported the right arm. 

The Venus&#x27; flesh is polished smooth, but chisel marks are still visible on other surfaces. The drapery is more elaborately carved on the right-hand side of the statue than the left, perhaps because on the left-hand side it was originally obscured from view. Likewise the Venus is less finely-finished from behind, suggesting that it was originally intended to be viewed only from the front. While the body of the Venus is depicted in a realistic style, the head is more idealised. The lips are slightly open, showing teeth, and the eyes and mouth are small. The sculpture has been minimally restored: only the tip of the nose, lower lip, big toe on the right foot, and some of the drapery.

Stylistically, the sculpture combines elements of classical and Hellenistic art. Features such as the small, regular eyes and mouth, and the strong brow and nose, are classical in style, while the shape of the torso and the deeply carved drapery are Hellenistic.

Kenneth Clark describes the figure as &quot;the last great work of antique Greece&quot;, and &quot;of all the works of antiquity one of the most complex and the most artful. ...[the sculptor] has consciously attempted to give the effect of a 5th-century work&quot;, while also using &quot;the inventions of his own time&quot;; &quot;the planes of her body are so large and calm that at first we do not realise the number of angles through which they pass. In architectural terms, she is a baroque composition with classic effect&quot;. 
==Discovery==

The &quot;Venus de Milo&quot; was discovered on 8 April 1820 by a Greek farmer on the island of Milos, then still part of the Ottoman Empire. Olivier Voutier, a French sailor interested in archaeology, witnessed the discovery and encouraged the farmer to continue digging. Voutier and the farmer uncovered two large pieces of the sculpture and a third, smaller piece. A fragment of an arm, a hand holding an apple, and two herms were also found alongside the statue. Two inscriptions were also apparently found with the Venus. One, transcribed by Dumont D&#x27;Urville, a French naval officer who arrived on Milos shortly after the discovery, commemorates a dedication by one Bakchios son of Satios, the assistant gymnasiarch. The other, recorded on a drawing made by Auguste Debay, preserves part of a sculptor&#x27;s signature. Both inscriptions are now lost. Other sculptural fragments found around the same time include a third herm, two further arms, and a foot with sandal.

Dumont D&#x27;Urville wrote an account of the find. According to his testimony, the Venus statue was found in a quadrangular niche. If this findspot were the original context for the Venus, the niche and the gymnasiarch&#x27;s inscription suggests that the &quot;Venus de Milo&quot; was installed in the gymnasium of Melos. An alternative theory proposed by Salomon Reinach is that the findspot was instead the remains of a lime kiln, and that the other fragments had no connection to the Venus; this theory is dismissed by Christofilis Maggidis as having &quot;no factual basis&quot;.

After stopping in Melos, D&#x27;Urville&#x27;s ship sailed to Constantinople, where he reported the find to the Comte de Marcellus, assistant to Charles François de Riffardeau, marquis de Rivière, the French ambassador. Rivière agreed that Marcellus should go to Melos to buy the statue. By the time Marcellus arrived at Melos, the farmer who discovered the statue had already received another offer to buy it, and it had been loaded onto a ship; the French intervened and Marcellus was able to buy the Venus. It was brought to France, where Louis XVIII had it installed in the Louvre. Contrary to the usual practice at the time, on the recommendation of Quatremère de Quincy, the Venus was not significantly restored but was exhibited in the state in which she was discovered. Quatremère, who believed that the Venus was originally part of a group with a sculpture of Mars, argued that as the entire Mars was missing it was impossible to restore the sculpture. 


==Display==

The &quot;Venus de Milo&quot; was initially installed in the Louvre in 1821; it was rapidly moved twice before finding a long-term home in the where it remained until 1848. From there it was moved to the , where it remained until being removed from the museum in 1870 for protection during the Paris Commune. When the was renovated in the 1880s, the Venus was given a new pedestal which allowed spectators to rotate the sculpture; at the same time the approach to the sculpture was filled with other ancient Venus statues. 

A proposal in 1919 to display the Venus alongside the Leonardo&#x27;s &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; and Michelangelo&#x27;s &quot;Dying Slave&quot; and &quot;Rebellious Slave&quot; was never carried out, but in 1936, the sculpture was once again moved to the to accommodate the volume of visitors to the Louvre; the other Venus statues were removed to focus visitors on the &quot;Venus de Milo&quot;. At this time the route for visitors through the Louvre was modified to be more chronological, coming through galleries of archaic and classical sculpture before arriving in a gallery dedicated to the Hellenstic period; the Venus de Milo was placed between the classical and Hellenistic galleries. During the Second World War the sculpture was once again removed from the Louvre for safekeeping, and stored in the Château de Valençay. In 1964 it was exhibited in Tokyo and Kyoto; this is the only time the sculpture has left France since it was acquired by the Louvre. In 1972 an experiment was made with a new site for the sculpture, and it was temporarily moved to allow renovations in the 1980s and 1990s; by 1999 the volume of visitors to the Venus was causing problems and the Louvre authorities were considering returning the sculpture to its previous setting. In 2010 the sculpture was installed in its new setting, with the sculptural fragments discovered alongside it on display in the same room.

==Interpretation==
===Identification===

The &quot;Venus de Milo&quot; is probably a sculpture of the goddess Aphrodite, but its fragmentary state makes secure identification difficult. The earliest written accounts of the sculpture, by a French captain and the French vice-consul on Melos, both identify it as representing Aphrodite holding the apple of discord, apparently on the basis of the hand holding an apple found with the sculpture. An alternative identification proposed by Reinach is that she represents the sea-goddess Amphitrite, and was originally grouped with a sculpture of Poseidon from Melos, discovered in 1878. Other proposed identifications include a Muse, Nemesis, or Sappho.

The authorship and date of the &quot;Venus de Milo&quot; were both disputed from its discovery. Within a month of its acquisition by the Louvre, three French scholars had published papers on the statue, disagreeing on all aspects of its interpretation: Toussaint-Bernard Éméric-David thought it dated to , between sculptors Phidias and Praxiteles; Quatremère de Quincy attributed it to the mid-fourth century and the circle of Praxiteles; and the Comte de Clarac thought it a later copy of a work by Praxiteles. The scholarly consensus in the 19th century was that the Venus dated to the fourth century BC. In 1893, Adolf Furtwängler was the first to argue that it was in fact late Hellenistic, dating to , and this dating continues to be widely accepted.

One of the inscriptions discovered with the statue, which was drawn by Debay as fitting into the missing section of the statue&#x27;s plinth, names the sculptor as [---]andros, son of [M]enides, of Antioch on the Maeander. The inscription must date to after 280 BC, when Antioch on the Maeander was founded; the lettering of the inscription suggests a date of 150–50 BC. Maggidis argues based on this inscription, as well as the style of the statue and the increasing prosperity of Melos in the period due to Roman involvement on the island which he suggests is a plausible context for the commissioning of the sculpture, that it probably dates to . Rachel Kousser agrees with Furtwängler&#x27;s dates for the sculpture. Marianne Hamiaux suggests . 

The association of the fragmentary artist&#x27;s signature with the sculpture, and thus the identification of the sculptor as Alexandros of Antioch, is not universally accepted. Kousser and Jean-Luc Martinez both question this connection. Kousser notes that though the plaque is shown fitting into the broken base of the Venus in Debay&#x27;s drawing, the drawing shows no evidence of the sculpture&#x27;s missing left foot which would have rested on it, while in Voutier&#x27;s sketch of the finds the plaque is shown as the base of one of the herms found alongside the Venus. As the inscription is lost, its connection to the Venus cannot be either proven or disproven.

Magiddis suggested that the &quot;Venus de Milo&quot; was carved by the same sculptor who also made the Poseidon of Melos. Isméni Trianti has suggested that three further sculptures found in Melos can be attributed to the same artist: two statues of women, and a colossal statue of a god.

===Reconstructions===

Without arms, it is unclear what the statue originally looked like. The original appearance of the Venus has been disputed since 1821, with de Clarac arguing that the Venus was a single figure holding an apple, whereas Quatremere held that she was part of a group, with her arms around another figure. Other proposed restorations have included the Venus holding wreaths, a dove, or spears.

Wilhelm Fröhner suggested in 1876 that the &quot;Venus de Milo&quot;&#x27;s right hand held the drapery slipping down from her hips, while the left held an apple; this theory was expanded on by Furtwängler. Kousser considers this the &quot;most plausible&quot; reconstruction. Scientific analyses conducted during restoration of the Venus in 2010 supported the theory that the arm fragment and hand holding the apple found alongside the sculpture were originally part of the Venus; Martinez argues that the identification of the sculpture as Venus holding an apple is thus definitively proved.

Hamiaux suggests that the &quot;Venus de Milo&quot; is of the same sculptural type as the Capuan Venus and another sculpture of Aphrodite from Perge. She argues that all derive from the cult statue in the temple of Aphrodite on the Acrocorinth, which depicted Aphrodite admiring herself in a shield. Christine Mitchell Havelock, who believes the Capuan Venus was based on the &quot;Venus de Milo&quot;, by contrast considers the Melian sculpture &quot;a fresh invention&quot; of the Hellenistic period.

==Reception==

No ancient source can be securely identified as discussing the &quot;Venus de Milo&quot;, and there are neither enough surviving ancient statues, nor enough evidence about how ancient Greeks judged artistic quality, to judge how the sculpture would have been received in the ancient world. 

But, according to Kenneth Clark (in 1949), &quot;within a few years of her discovery in 1820, the Venus de Milo had taken the central, impregnable position formerly occupied by the Venus de&#x27; Medici, and even now that she has lost favour with connoisseurs and archaeologists she has held her place in popular imagery as a symbol, or trade mark, of Beauty&quot;.

Today the &quot;Venus de Milo&quot; is perhaps the most famous ancient Greek statue in the world, seen by more than seven million visitors every year. It established itself as a key part of the Louvre&#x27;s antiquities collection soon after its discovery. At this time, the Louvre had recently lost several major works following the Napoleonic Wars, as objects acquired by Napoleon were returned to their countries of origin. The Venus was soon one of the most famous antiquities in Europe; in the 19th century it was distributed in plaster casts, photographs, and bronze copies. A plaster cast was sent to the Berlin Academy in 1822, only a year after the Louvre acquired the Venus, and a cast was displayed at The Crystal Palace.

The &quot;Venus de Milo&quot; has been the subject of both literature and the visual arts since its discovery. More than 70 poems about the Venus have been published. In the 19th century paintings of the Venus often depicted statuettes of the figure, for instance in Honoré Daumier&#x27;s &quot;The Connoisseur&quot;. 19th-century artists also used the Venus as a model: Max Klinger based the Minerva in his &quot;Judgement of Paris&quot; on the Venus de Milo; Eugene Delacroix may have used it for &quot;Liberty Leading the People&quot;.

In the early 20th century, the &quot;Venus de Milo&quot; caught the attention of the surrealist movement. Erwin Blumenfeld and Clarence Sinclair Bull both made photomontages based on the Venus. Max Ernst used the Venus in his &quot;instruction manuals&quot;; René Magritte painted a plaster copy of the Venus, making her body pink, her robe blue, and leaving the head white; and Salvador Dalì based several paintings and sculptures, including his painting &quot;The Hallucinogenic Toreador&quot;, on her. In contemporary art, Niki de Saint-Phalle has used a reproduction of the Venus in a performance, Yves Klein produced a copy in International Klein Blue, and artists including Arman, Clive Barker, and Jim Dine have all made sculptures inspired by the Venus. 

The iconic status of the &quot;Venus de Milo&quot; has meant that in the 20th century it has been used in film and advertising: a poster for the 1932 film &quot;Blonde Venus&quot; shows Marlene Dietrich as the &quot;Venus de Milo&quot;, while in 2003 Eva Green, wearing only a white sheet and black arm-length gloves, recreated the sculpture in &quot;The Dreamers&quot;. Actresses have frequently been compared to the Venus: an article in &quot;Photoplay&quot; in 1928 concluded the Joan Crawford was the Hollywood actress whose measurements most resembled the &quot;Venus de Milo&quot;, Clara Bow and Jean Harlow were both photographed as the Venus for magazines. Advertisements for Kellogg&#x27;s cornflakes, an early speakerphone made by General Telephone &amp; Electronics, Levi&#x27;s jeans and Mercedes-Benz cars have all used the Venus.

In contrast with the popular and artistic appreciation of the Venus, since Fürtwangler re-dated the sculpture to the Hellenistic period some scholars have been more critical. In his &quot;History of Greek Art&quot;, Martin Robertson argues that the sculpture&#x27;s reputation is due more to propaganda than to its own artistic merit. Scholars have concentrated on studying copies of classical sculpture mentioned in ancient sources, such as the Aphrodite of Knidos, than the Venus de Milo, even when those copies are generally considered to be technically inferior to the Venus; Elizabeth Prettejohn argues that this is due to classicists&#x27; bias towards written sources over visual ones.

<doc id="53436" wikidata="Q173366" url="?curid=53436" title="Bayonet">
<text>A bayonet (from Old French , now spelt ) is a knife, dagger, sword, or spike-shaped melee weapon designed to be mounted on the end of the barrel of a rifle, carbine, musket or similar long firearm, allowing the gun to be used as an improvised spear in close combat.

The term is derived from the town of Bayonne in southwestern France, where bayonets were supposedly first used by Basques in the 17th century. From the early 17th to the early 20th century, it was an infantry melee weapon used for both offensive and defensive tactics, usually when charging in mass formations (human wave attacks). In contemporary times, bayonets are considered a weapon of last resort, and are rarely used in combat, although they are still used for ceremonial purposes (e.g, Military parades). 

==History==

The term &quot;bayonette&quot; itself dates back to the 16th century, but it is not clear whether bayonets at the time were knives that could be fitted to the ends of firearms, or simply a type of knife. For example, Cotgrave&#x27;s 1611 &quot;Dictionarie&quot; describes the bayonet as &quot;a kind of small flat pocket dagger, furnished with knives; or a great knife to hang at the girdle&quot;. Likewise, Pierre Borel wrote in 1655 that a kind of long-knife called a &quot;bayonette&quot; was made in Bayonne but does not give any further description. There are some accounts that place the invention of the bayonet in either France or Germany as early as 1570.

===Plug bayonets===
The first recorded instance of a bayonet proper is found in the Chinese military treatise, published in 1606. It was in the form of the , a breech-loading musket that was issued with a roughly long plug bayonet, giving it an overall length of with the bayonet attached. It was labelled as a &quot;gun-blade&quot; () with it being described as a &quot;short sword that can be inserted into the barrel and secured by twisting it slightly&quot; that it is to be used &quot;when the battle have depleted both gunpowder and bullets as well as fighting against bandits, when forces are closing into melee or encountering an ambush&quot; and if one &quot;cannot load the gun within the time it takes to cover two bu (3.2 meters) of ground they are to attach the bayonet and hold it like a spear&quot;.

Early bayonets were of the &quot;plug&quot; type, where the bayonet was fitted directly into the barrel of the musket. This allowed light infantry to be converted to heavy infantry and hold off cavalry charges. The bayonet had a round handle that slid directly into the musket barrel. This naturally prevented the gun from being fired. The first known mention of the use of bayonets in European warfare was in the memoirs of Jacques de Chastenet, Vicomte de Puységur. He described the French using crude plug bayonets during the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648). However, it was not until 1671 that General Jean Martinet standardized and issued plug bayonets to the French regiment of fusiliers then raised. They were issued to part of an English dragoon regiment raised in 1672, and to the Royal Fusiliers when raised in 1685.

===Socket bayonets===
The major problem with plug bayonets was that when attached they made it impossible to fire the musket, requiring soldiers to wait until the last possible moment before a melee to fix the bayonet. The defeat of forces loyal to William of Orange by Jacobite Highlanders at the Battle of Killiecrankie in 1689 was due (among other things) to the use of the plug bayonet. The Highlanders closed to , fired a single volley, dropped their muskets, and using axes and swords quickly overwhelmed the loyalists before they had time to fix bayonets. Shortly thereafter, the defeated leader, Hugh Mackay, is believed to have introduced a socket bayonet of his own invention. Soon &quot;socket&quot; bayonets would incorporate both socket mounts and an offset blade that fit around the musket&#x27;s barrel, which allowed the musket to be fired and reloaded while the bayonet was attached.

An unsuccessful trial with socket or zigzag bayonets was made after the Battle of Fleurus in 1690, in the presence of King Louis XIV, who refused to adopt them, as they had a tendency to fall off the musket. Shortly after the Peace of Ryswick (1697), the English and Germans abolished the pike and introduced socket bayonets. The British socket bayonet had a spike with a triangular cross-section rather than a flat blade, with a flat side towards the muzzle and two fluted sides outermost to a length of . It had no lock to keep it fast to the muzzle, and was well-documented for falling off in the heat of battle.

By the mid-18th century, socket bayonets had been adopted by most European armies. In 1703, the French infantry adopted a spring-loaded locking system that prevented the bayonet from accidentally separating from the musket. A triangular blade was introduced around 1715 and was stronger than the previous single or double-edged model.

===Sword bayonets===
The 18th century introduced the concept of the sword bayonet, a long-bladed weapon with a single- or double-edged blade that could also be used as a shortsword. Its initial purpose was to ensure that riflemen could form an infantry square properly to fend off cavalry attacks when in ranks with musketmen, whose weapons were longer. A prime early example of a sword bayonet-fitted rifle is the Pattern 1800 Infantry Rifle, later known as the &quot;Baker Rifle&quot;. Sword bayonets were used by German Jagers in the 18th century. The hilt usually had quillons modified to accommodate the gun barrel and a hilt mechanism that enabled the bayonet to be attached to a bayonet lug. A sword bayonet could be used in combat as a sidearm, when detached from the musket or rifle. When the bayonet was attached to the musket or rifle, it effectively turned all long guns into a spear or glaive, which made it suitable for both thrusting and cutting attacks.

While the British Army eventually discarded the sword bayonet, the socket bayonet survived the introduction of the rifled musket into British service in 1854. The new rifled musket copied the French locking ring system. The new bayonet proved its worth at the Battle of Alma and the Battle of Inkerman during the Crimean War, where the Imperial Russian Army learned to fear it.

In the 1860s, European nations began to develop new bolt-action breechloading rifles (such as the Chassepot and Snider–Enfield) and sword bayonets suitable for mass production and used by police, pioneer, and engineer troops. The decision to redesign the bayonet into a short sword was viewed by some as an acknowledgement of the decline in importance of the fixed bayonet as a weapon in the face of new advances in firearms technology. As a British newspaper put it, &quot;the committee, in recommending this new sword bayonet, appear to have had in view the fact that bayonets will henceforth be less frequently used than in former times as a weapon of offence and defence; they desired, therefore, to substitute an instrument of more general utility.&quot;

===Multipurpose bayonets===
One of these multipurpose designs was the &#x27;sawback&#x27; bayonet, which incorporated saw teeth on the spine of the blade. The sawback bayonet was intended for use as a general-purpose utility tool as well as a weapon; the teeth were meant to facilitate the cutting of wood for various defensive works such as barbed-wire posts, as well as for butchering livestock. It was initially adopted by the German states in 1865; until the middle of WWI approximately 5% of every bayonet style was complemented with a sawback version, for example in Belgium in 1868, Great Britain in 1869 and Switzerland in 1878 (Switzerland introduced their last model in 1914). The original sawback bayonets were typically of the heavy sword-type, they were issued to engineers, with to some extent the bayonet aspect being secondary to the &quot;tool&quot; aspect. Later German sawbacks were more of a rank indicator than a functional saw. Generally, an average of 6% of all bayonets were sawbacks for non-commissioned officers. There were some exceptions, such as the kurzes Seitengewehr 1898 model, all of which were of the sawback design and meant for what was considered more prestigious units, such as machine gunners, telegraph troop and colonial troops. The sawback proved relatively ineffective as a cutting tool, and was soon outmoded by improvements in military logistics and transportation; most nations dropped the sawback feature by the early 20th century. The German army discontinued use of the sawback bayonet in 1917 after protests that the serrated blade caused unnecessarily severe wounds when used as a fixed bayonet.

The &quot;trowel&quot; or &quot;spade&quot; bayonet was another multipurpose design, intended for use both as an offensive weapon as well as a digging tool for excavating entrenchments. In 1870, the US Army issued trowel bayonets to infantry regiments based on a design by Lieutenant-Colonel Edmund Rice, a US Army officer and Civil War veteran, which were manufactured by the Springfield Armory. Besides its utility as both a fixed bayonet and a digging implement, the Rice trowel bayonet could be used to plaster log huts and stone chimneys for winter quarters; sharpened on one edge, it could cut tent poles and pins. Ten thousand were eventually issued, and the design saw service during the 1877 Nez Perce campaign. Rice was given leave in 1877 to demonstrate his trowel bayonet to several nations in Europe. One infantry officer recommended it to the exclusion of all other designs, noting that &quot;the entrenching tools of an army rarely get up to the front until the exigency for their use has passed.&quot; The Rice trowel bayonet was declared obsolete by the US Army in December 1881.

===&quot;Reach&quot; controversy===

Prior to World War I, bayonet doctrine was largely founded upon the concept of &quot;reach&quot;; that is, a soldier&#x27;s theoretical ability, by use of an extremely long rifle and fixed bayonet, to stab an enemy soldier without having to approach within reach of his opponent&#x27;s blade. A combined length of rifle and bayonet longer than that of the enemy infantryman&#x27;s rifle and attached bayonet, like the infantryman&#x27;s pike of bygone days, was thought to impart a tactical advantage on the battlefield.

In 1886, the French army introduced a quadrangular épée spike for the bayonet of the Lebel Model 1886 rifle, the &quot;Épée-Baïonnette Modèle 1886&quot;, resulting in a rifle and bayonet with an overall length of . Germany responded by introducing a long sword bayonet for the Model 1898 Mauser rifle, which had a 29-inch barrel. The bayonet, the &quot;Seitengewehr 98&quot;, had a 50 cm (19.7-inch) blade. With an overall length of , the German army&#x27;s rifle/bayonet combination was second only to the French Lebel for overall &#x27;reach&#x27;.

After 1900, Switzerland, Britain, and the United States adopted rifles with barrel lengths shorter than that of a rifled musket, but longer than that of a carbine. These were intended for general use by infantry and cavalry. The &quot;reach&quot; of the new short rifles with attached bayonets was reduced. Britain introduced the SMLE (Short, Magazine, Lee–Enfield), in 1904. The German M1898 Mauser rifle and attached sword bayonet was 20 cm (eight inches) longer than the SMLE and its P1903 bayonet, which used a twelve-inch (30 cm) blade. While the British P1903 and its similar predecessor, the P1888, was satisfactory in service, criticism soon arose regarding the shortened reach. One military writer of the day warned: &quot;The German soldier has eight inches the better of the argument over the British soldier when it comes to crossing bayonets, and the extra eight inches easily turns the battle in favour of the longer, if both men are of equal skill.&quot;

In 1905, the German Army adopted a shortened bayonet, the &quot;Seitengewehr 98/05&quot; for engineer and pioneer troops, and in 1908, a short rifle as well, the &quot;Karabiner Model 1898AZ&quot;, which was produced in limited quantities for the cavalry, artillery, and other specialist troops. However, the long-barreled 98 Mauser rifle remained in service as the primary infantry small arm. Moreover, German military authorities continued to promote the idea of outreaching one&#x27;s opponent on the battlefield by means of a longer rifle/bayonet combination, a concept prominently featured in its infantry bayonet training doctrines. These included the &quot;throw point&quot; or &quot;extended thrust-and-lunge&quot; attack. Using this tactic, the German soldier dropped into a half-crouch, with the rifle and fixed bayonet held close to the body. In this position the soldier next propelled his rifle forward, then dropped the supporting hand while taking a step forward with the right foot, simultaneously thrusting out the right arm to full length with the extended rifle held in the grip of the right hand alone. With a maximum &#x27;kill zone&#x27; of some eleven feet, the &quot;throw point&quot; bayonet attack gave an impressive increase in &#x27;reach&#x27;, and was later adopted by other military forces, including the U.S. Army.

In response to criticism over the reduced reach of the SMLE rifle and bayonet, British ordnance authorities introduced the P1907 bayonet in 1908, which had an elongated blade of some seventeen inches to compensate for the reduced overall length of the SMLE rifle. The 1907 bayonet was essentially a copy of the Japanese Type 30 bayonet, Britain having purchased a number of Japanese type 30 rifles for the Royal Navy during the preceding years. U.S. authorities in turn adopted a long (16-in. blade) bayonet for the M1903 Springfield short rifle, the M1905 bayonet; later, a long sword bayonet was also provided for the M1917 Enfield rifle.

===Reversal in opinion===
The experience of World War I reversed opinion on the value of long rifles and bayonets in typical infantry combat operations. Whether in the close confines of trench warfare, night time raiding and patrolling, or attacking across open ground, soldiers of both sides soon recognized the inherent limitations of a long and ungainly rifle and bayonet when used as a close-quarters battle weapon. Once Allied soldiers had been trained to expect the &quot;throw point&quot; or &quot;extended thrust-and-lunge attack&quot;, the method lost most of its tactical value on the World War I battlefield. It required a strong arm and wrist, was very slow to recover if the initial thrust missed its mark, and was easily parried by a soldier who was trained to expect it, thus exposing the German soldier to a return thrust which he could not easily block or parry. Instead of longer bayonets, infantry forces on both sides began experimenting with other weapons as auxiliary close-quarter arms, including the trench knife, trench club, handgun, hand grenade, and entrenching tool.

Soldiers soon began employing the bayonet as a knife as well as an attachment for the rifle, and bayonets were often shortened officially or unofficially to make them more versatile and easier to use as tools, or to maneuver in close quarters. During World War II, bayonets were further shortened into knife-sized weapons in order to give them additional utility as fighting or utility knives. The vast majority of modern bayonets introduced since World War II are of the knife bayonet type.

==Bayonet charge==

The development of the bayonet from the 17th century onwards led to the bayonet charge becoming the main infantry tactic throughout the 18th, 19th, and early 20th century. The British Army under Wolesley, the later Duke of Wellington, evolved its tactics to adopt the &quot;Volley and Bayonet Charge&quot; from the earlier &quot;Highland Charge&quot; tactic of Highland regiments under his command. These proto &quot;fire and maneuver&quot; tactics were first introduced to the British Army by the 42nd Highlanders (Black Watch) at Fontenoy in 1745 although, they had been used by their antecedents, (The Independent Highland Watch Companies) prior to that. As early as the 19th century, military scholars were already noting that most bayonet charges did not result in close combat. Instead, one side usually fled before actual bayonet fighting ensued. The act of fixing bayonets has been held to be primarily connected to morale, the making of a clear signal to friend and foe of a willingness to kill at close quarters.

The bayonet charge was above all a tool of shock. While charges were reasonably common in 18th and 19th century warfare, actual combat between formations with their bayonets was so rare as to be effectively nonexistent. Usually, a charge would only happen after a long exchange of gunfire, and one side would break and run before contact was actually made. Sir Charles Oman, nearing the end of his history of the Peninsular War (1807–1814) in which he had closely studied hundreds of battles and combats, only discovered a single example of, in his words, &quot;one of the rarest things in the Peninsular War, a real hand-to-hand fight with the white weapon.&quot; Infantry melees were much more common in close country – towns, villages, earthworks and other terrain which reduced visibility to such ranges that hand-to-hand fighting was unavoidable. These melees, however, were not bayonet charges per se, as they were not executed or defended against by regular bodies of orderly infantry; rather, they were a chaotic series of individual combats where musket butts and fists were used alongside bayonets, swords, and polearms.

===Napoleonic wars===
The bayonet charge was a common tactic used during the Napoleonic wars. Despite its effectiveness, a bayonet charge did not necessarily cause substantial casualties through the use of the weapon itself. Detailed battle casualty lists from the 18th century showed that in many battles, less than 2% of all wounds treated were caused by bayonets. Antoine-Henri Jomini, a celebrated military author who served in numerous armies during the Napoleonic period, stated that the majority of bayonet charges in the open resulted with one side fleeing before any contact was made. Combat with bayonets did occur, but mostly on a small scale when units of opposing sides encountered each other in a confined environment, such as during the storming of fortifications or during ambush skirmishes in broken terrain. In an age of fire by massed volley, when compared to random unseen bullets, the threat of the bayonet was much more tangible and immediate – guaranteed to lead to a personal gruesome conclusion if both sides persisted. All this encouraged men to flee before the lines met. Thus, the bayonet was an immensely useful weapon for capturing ground from the enemy, despite seldom actually being used to inflict wounds.

===American Civil War===

During the American Civil War (1861–1865) the bayonet was found to be responsible for less than 1% of battlefield casualties, a hallmark of modern warfare. The use of bayonet charges to force the enemy to retreat was very successful in numerous small unit engagements at short range in the American Civil War, as most troops would retreat when charged while reloading. Although such charges inflicted few casualties, they often decided short engagements, and tactical possession of important defensive ground features. Additionally, bayonet drill could be used to rally men temporarily unnerved by enemy fire.
While the overall Battle of Gettysburg was won by the Union armies due to a combination of terrain and massed artillery fire, a decisive point on the second day of the battle hinged on a bayonet charge at Little Round Top when Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain&#x27;s 20th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment, running short of musket ammunition, charged downhill, surprising and capturing many of the surviving soldiers of the 15th Alabama Infantry Regiment and other Confederate regiments. Other bayonet charges occurred at Gettysburg, such as that of the 1st Minnesota Infantry Regiment. This was ordered in desperation by General Hancock earlier on July 2 in order to delay a Confederate brigade&#x27;s advance long enough to bring up reinforcements for the holed Union line on Cemetery Ridge. Still another bayonet charge was conducted late in the evening on July 2 by the 137th New York Infantry Regiment defending the extreme right flank of the Union line on Culp&#x27;s Hill. The charge of several companies managed to temporarily stall the advance of the 10th Virginia Infantry Regiment long enough for the 14th Brooklyn to move in on the 137th&#x27;s right and repel the attack.

===Going over the top===
The popular image of World War I combat is of a wave of soldiers with bayonets fixed, &quot;going over the top&quot; and charging across no man&#x27;s land into a hail of enemy fire. Although this was the standard method of fighting early in the war, it was rarely successful. British casualties on the first day of the Battle of the Somme were the worst in the history of the British army, with casualties, whom were killed.

During World War I, no man&#x27;s land was often hundreds of yards across. The area was usually devastated by the warfare and riddled with craters from artillery and mortar shells, and sometimes contaminated by chemical weapons. Heavily defended by machine guns, mortars, artillery, and riflemen on both sides, it was often covered with barbed wire and land mines, and littered with the rotting corpses of those who were not able to make it across the sea of projectiles, explosions, and flames. A bayonet charge through no man&#x27;s land often resulted in the total annihilation of entire battalions.

===Banzai charges===
The advent of modern warfare in the 20th century made bayonet charges dubious affairs. During the Siege of Port Arthur (1904–1905), the Japanese used human wave attacks against Russian artillery and machine guns, suffering massive casualties.

However, during the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese were able to use bayonet charges effectively against poorly organized and lightly armed Chinese troops. &quot;Banzai charges&quot; became an accepted military tactic where Japanese forces were able to rout larger Chinese forces routinely.

In the early stages of the Pacific War (1941–1945), a sudden bayonet charge could overwhelm unprepared enemy soldiers. Such charges became known to Allied forces as &quot;Banzai charges&quot; from the Japanese battle cry. By the end of the war, against well organized and heavily armed Allied forces, a banzai charge inflicted little damage but at high cost. They were sometimes conducted as a last resort by small groups of surviving soldiers when the main battle was already lost.

Some Japanese commanders, such as General Tadamichi Kuribayashi, recognized the futility and waste of such attacks and expressly forbade their men from carrying them out. Indeed, the Americans were surprised that the Japanese did not employ banzai charges at the Battle of Iwo Jima.

===Human wave attack===
The term &quot;human wave attack&quot; was often misused to describe the Chinese short attack—a combination of infiltration and the shock tactics employed by the People&#x27;s Liberation Army during the Korean War (1950–1953). A typical Chinese short attack was carried out at night by sending a series of small five-man fireteams to attack the weakest point of an enemy&#x27;s defenses. The Chinese assault team would crawl undetected within grenade range, then launch surprise attacks with fixed bayonets against the defenders in order to breach the defenses by relying on maximum shock and confusion.

If the initial shock failed to breach the defenses, additional fireteams would press on behind them and attack the same point until a breach was created. Once penetration was achieved, the bulk of the Chinese forces would move into the enemy rear and attack from behind. Due to primitive communication systems and tight political controls within the Chinese army, short attacks were often repeated until either the defenses were penetrated or the attackers were completely annihilated.

This persistent attack pattern left a strong impression on UN forces that fought in Korea, giving birth to the description of &quot;human wave&quot;. The term &quot;human wave&quot; was later used by journalists and military officials to convey the image of the American soldiers being assaulted by overwhelming numbers of Chinese on a broad front, which is inaccurate when compared with the normal Chinese practice of sending successive series of small teams against a weak point in the line. It was in fact rare for the Chinese to actually use densely concentrated infantry formations to absorb enemy firepower.

===Modern usage===
One use the Germans in World War II made of bayonets was to search for people in hiding. One person hiding in a house in the Netherlands wrote: &quot;The Germans made lots of noise as they came upstairs, and they stabbed their bayonets into the wall. Then what we&#x27;d always feared actually happened: A bayonet went through the thin wallpaper above the closet, exposing the three people who were hiding there. &#x27;Raus!&#x27; cried the Germans. &#x27;Out!&#x27;&quot;.

During the Korean War, the French Battalion and Turkish Brigade used bayonet charges against enemy combatants. In 1951, United States Army officer Lewis L. Millett led soldiers of the US Army&#x27;s 27th Infantry Regiment in capturing a machine gun position with bayonets. Historian S. L. A. Marshall described the attack as &quot;the most complete bayonet charge by American troops since Cold Harbor&quot;. The location subsequently became known as Bayonet Hill. This was the last bayonet charge by the US Army. Millett was awarded the Medal of Honor.

On 23 October 1962, during the Sino-Indian War, 20 Indian soldiers led by Joginder Singh fixed bayonets and charged a force of 200 Chinese soldiers. While the charge would prove futile for Singh and his men, it initially threw the Chinese off guard and forced a retreat despite outnumbering them 10 to 1.

On 8 May 1970, National Guardsmen attacked student demonstrators with bayonets at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque. The demonstrators were protesting the war in Vietnam and Cambodia, and the killing of four students at Kent State University. Eleven were injured, some seriously.
In 1982, the British Army mounted bayonet charges during the Falklands War, notably the 3rd Battalion, Parachute Regiment during the Battle of Mount Longdon and the 2nd Battalion, Scots Guards during the final assault of Mount Tumbledown.

In 1995, during the Siege of Sarajevo, UN peacekeepers of the French 3rd Marine Infantry Regiment charged Serbian forces at the Battle of Vrbanja bridge. Actions led by the regiment allowed the UN peacekeepers to retreat from a threatened position. Two fatalities and seventeen wounded resulted.

During the Second Gulf War and the war in Afghanistan, British Army units mounted several bayonet charges. In 2004, at the Battle of Danny Boy in Iraq, the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders charged mortar positions of the Mahdi Army. The ensuing hand-to-hand fighting resulted in an estimate of over 40 insurgents killed and 35 bodies collected and nine prisoners. Sergeant Brian Wood, of the Princess of Wales&#x27;s Royal Regiment, was awarded the Military Cross for his part in the battle.

In 2009, Lieutenant James Adamson of the Royal Regiment of Scotland was awarded the Military Cross for a bayonet charge while in Afghanistan. Adamson had run out of ammunition so he immediately charged a Taliban fighter with his bayonet. Lance Corporal Sean Jones of The Princess of Wales&#x27;s Regiment was awarded the Military Cross for his role in a 2011 bayonet charge.

==Contemporary bayonets==
Today, the bayonet is rarely used in one-to-one combat. Despite its limitations, many modern assault rifles (including bullpup designs) retain a bayonet lug and the bayonet is issued by many armies. The bayonet is used for controlling prisoners, or as a weapon of last resort. In addition, some authorities have concluded that the bayonet serves as a useful training aid in building morale and increasing desired aggressiveness in troops.

Today&#x27;s bayonets often double as multi-purpose utility knives, bottle openers or other tools. Issuing one modern multi-purpose bayonet/knife is also more cost effective than issuing separate specialty bayonets, and field/combat knives.

===Soviet Union===
The original AK-47 has an adequate but unremarkable bayonet. However, the AKM Type I bayonet (introduced in 1959) was an improvement of the original design. It has a Bowie style (clip-point) blade with saw-teeth along the spine, and can be used as a multi-purpose survival knife and wire-cutter when combined with its steel scabbard. The AK-74 bayonet 6Kh5 (introduced in 1983) represents a further refinement of the AKM bayonet. &quot;It introduced a radical blade cross-section, that has a flat milled on one side near the edge and a corresponding flat milled on the opposite side near the false edge.&quot; The blade has a new spear point and an improved one-piece moulded plastic grip, making it a more effective fighting knife. It also has saw-teeth on the false edge and the usual hole for use as a wire-cutter. The wire cutting versions of the AK bayonets each have an electrically insulated handle and an electrically insulated part of the scabbard, so it can be used to cut an electrified wire.

===United States===
The American M16 rifle used the M7 bayonet which is based on earlier designs such as the M4, M5 and M6 models, all of which are direct descendants of the M3 Fighting Knife and have a spear-point blade with a half sharpened secondary edge. The newer M9 has a clip-point blade with saw-teeth along the spine, and can be used as a multi-purpose knife and wire-cutter when combined with its scabbard. It can even be used by troops to cut their way free through the relatively thin metal skin of a crashed helicopter or airplane. The current USMC OKC-3S bayonet bears a resemblance to the Marines&#x27; iconic Ka-Bar fighting knife with serrations near the handle.

===People&#x27;s Republic of China===
The AK-47 was adopted by Communist China as the Type 56 assault rifle and includes an integral folding spike bayonet, similar to the SKS rifle. Some Type 56s may also use the AKM Type II bayonet. The latest Chinese rifle, the QBZ-95, has a multi-purpose knife bayonet similar to the US M9.

===Belgium===
The FN FAL has two types of bayonet. The first is a traditional spear point bayonet. The second is the Type C socket bayonet introduced in the 1960s. It has a hollow handle that fits over the muzzle and slots that lined up with those on the FALs 22 mm NATO-spec flash hider. Its spear-type blade is offset to the side of the handle to allow the bullet to pass beside the blade.

===United Kingdom===
The current British L3A1 socket bayonet is based on the FN FAL Type C socket bayonet with a clip-point blade. It has a hollow handle that fits over the SA80/L85 rifle&#x27;s muzzle and slots that lined up with those on the flash eliminator. The blade is offset to the side of the handle to allow the bullet to pass beside the blade. It can also be used as a multi-purpose knife and wire-cutter when combined with its scabbard. The scabbard also has a sharpening stone and folding saw blade. The use of contemporary bayonets by the British army was noted during the Afghanistan war in 2004. Traditionally, bayonets are instead called swords in The Rifles.

===Germany===
The H&amp;K G3 rifle uses two types of bayonets, both of which is mounted above the G3&#x27;s rifle barrel. The first is the standard G3 bayonet which has a blade similar to the American M7 bayonet. The second is an Eickhorn KCB-70 type multi-purpose knife bayonet, featuring a clip-point with saw-back, a wire-cutter scabbard and a distinctive squared handgrip. For the H&amp;K G36 there was little use of modified AKM type II knife bayonets from stocks of the former Nationale Volksarmee (National People&#x27;s Army) of East Germany. The original muzzle-ring was cut away and a new, large diameter muzzle ring welded in place. The original leather belt hanger was replaced by a complex web and plastic belt hanger designed to fit the West German load bearing equipment.

===Austria===
The Steyr AUG uses two types of bayonet. The first and most common is an Eickhorn KCB-70 type multi-purpose bayonet with an M16 bayonet type interface. The second are the Glock &quot;Feldmesser 78&quot; (Field Knife 78) and the &quot;Feldmesser 81&quot; (Survival Knife 81), which can also be used as a bayonet, by engaging a socket in the pommel (covered by a plastic cap) into a bayonet adapter that can be fitted to the AUG rifle. These bayonets are noteworthy, as they were meant to be used primarily as field or survival knives and use as a bayonet was a secondary consideration. They can also be used as throwing knives and have a built-in bottle opener in the crossguard.

===France===
The French use a more traditional spear point bayonet with the current FAMAS bayonet which is nearly identical to that of the M1949/56 bayonet. The new French H&amp;K 416F rifle uses the Eickhorn &quot;SG 2000 WC-F&quot;, a multi-purpose combat knife/bayonet (similar to the KM2000) with a wire cutter. It weighs , is long with a half serrated blade for cutting through ropes. The synthetic handle and sheath have electrical insulation that protects up to 10,000 volts. The sheath also has a diamond blade sharpener.

==Linguistic impact==
The push-twist motion of fastening the older type of spike bayonet has given a name to:
*The &quot;bayonet mount&quot; used for various types of quick fastenings, such as camera lenses, also called a &quot;bayonet connector&quot; when used in electrical plugs.
*Several connectors and contacts including the bayonet-fitting light bulb that is common in the UK (as opposed to the continental European screw-fitting type).
*One type of connector for foil and sabre weapons used in modern fencing competitions is referred to as a &quot;bayonet&quot; connector.

In chess, an aggressive variation of the King&#x27;s Indian Defence is known as the &quot;Bayonet Attack&quot;.

The bayonet has become a symbol of military power. The term &quot;at the point of a bayonet&quot; refers to using military force or action to accomplish, maintain, or defend something (cf. Bayonet Constitution). Undertaking a task &quot;with fixed bayonets&quot; has this connotation of no room for compromise and is a phrase used particularly in politics.

==Badges and insignias==
The Australian Army &#x27;Rising Sun&#x27; badge features a semicircle of bayonets. The Australian Army Infantry Combat Badge (ICB) takes the form of a vertically mounted Australian Army SLR (7.62mm self-loading rifle FN FAL) bayonet surrounded by an oval-shaped laurel wreath.

The US Army Combat Action Badge, awarded to personnel who have come under fire since 2001 and who are not eligible for the Combat Infantryman Badge (due to the fact that only Infantry personnel may be awarded the Combat Infantryman Badge), has a bayonet as its central motif. The shoulder sleeve insignia for the 10th Mountain Division in the US Army features crossed bayonets. The US Army&#x27;s 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team&#x27;s shoulder patch features a bayonet wrapped in a wing, symbolizing their airborne status. The brigade regularly deploys in task forces under the name &quot;Bayonet&quot;.

The insignia of the British Army&#x27;s School of Infantry is an SA80 bayonet against a red shield. It is worn as a Tactical recognition flash (TRF) by instructors at the Infantry Training Centre Catterick, the Infantry Battle School at Brecon and the Support Weapons School in Warminster. Fixed bayonets also feature on the cap badge and tactical recognition flash of the Small Arms School Corps.

The vocation tab collar insignia for the Singapore Armed Forces Infantry Formation utilizes two crossed bayonets. The bayonet is often used as a symbol of the Infantry in Singapore.

<doc id="53441" wikidata="Q2172035" url="?curid=53441" title="Rock Creek Park">
<text>Rock Creek Park is a large urban park that bisects the Northwest quadrant of Washington, D.C. Created by Act of Congress in 1890, the park comprises 1,754 acres (2.74 mi2, 7.10 km2), generally along Rock Creek, a tributary of the Potomac River.

More than two million people visit the park each year, many to use recreation facilities such as its golf course; hiking, biking, and equestrian trails; tennis center; nature center; playgrounds, and picnic facilities.

The park is administered by the National Park Service, whose Rock Creek Park administrative unit administers dozens of other federally owned properties in the District of Columbia, including Meridian Hill Park, the Old Stone House in Georgetown, and some of the Fort Circle Parks, a series of batteries and forts built to defend the nation&#x27;s capital during the American Civil War. 

The Rock Creek Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 23, 1991.

== History ==
Rock Creek Park was established by an act of Congress signed into law by President Benjamin Harrison on September 27, 1890, following active advocacy by Charles C. Glover and other civic leaders and in the wake of the creation of the National Zoo the preceding year. 
It was only the third national park established by the U.S., following Yellowstone in 1872 and Mackinac National Park in 1875. Sequoia was created at the same time, and Yosemite shortly thereafter. In 1933, Rock Creek Park became part of the newly formed National Capital Parks unit of the National Park Service.

The Rock Creek Park Act authorized the purchase of no more than of land, extending north from Klingle Ford Bridge in the District of Columbia (approximately the northern limit of the National Zoo), to be &quot;perpetually dedicated and set apart as a public park or pleasure ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people of the United States&quot;. The Act also called for regulations to &quot;provide for the preservation from injury or spoliation of all timber, animals, or curiosities within said park, and their retention in their natural condition, as nearly as possible&quot;. Rock Creek Park is the oldest natural urban park in the National Park System. Park construction began in 1897.

In 1913, Congress authorized creation of the Rock Creek and Potomac Parkway and extended the park along a narrow corridor from the zoo to the mouth of Rock Creek at the Potomac River. The parkway remains a major traffic thoroughfare, especially along the portion south of the zoo. 

The park&#x27;s golf course, designed by William Flynn, was opened with nine holes in 1923 and expanded three years later to 18. Like the rest of the city&#x27;s public courses, it was segregated until 1941, when U.S. Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes ordered them all opened to African Americans.

In the 1980s, hundreds of stones removed from the United States Capitol during a renovation were stored in the park. The loose pile, two stories high, was a popular, if unmarked and unsanctioned, attraction, and their removal in 2022 drew local and even national attention.

By the late 1990s, a popular conception had arisen that the park was unsafe. This persisted despite crime data, provided by D.C. police and park officials, that showed that the park saw fewer crimes than surrounding neighborhoods. The misperception was fed by the 2002 discovery in the park of the skeletal remains of Chandra Levy, a federal intern whose disappearance had attracted national media attention.

== Description ==


The main section of the park comprises 1754 acres (2.74 mi2, 7.10 km2), along the Rock Creek Valley. Including the other green areas the park administers (Glover Archbold Park, Montrose Park, Dumbarton Oaks Park, Meridian Hill Park, Battery Kemble Park, Palisades Park, Whitehaven Park, etc.), it encompasses more than 2000 acres (3 mi2, 8 km2).

The parklands follow the course of Rock Creek across the D.C.-Maryland border to connect with Rock Creek Stream Valley Park and Rock Creek Regional Park in Montgomery County. The Maryland parks are operated by the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission.

The Rock Creek Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 23, 1991.
Recreation facilities include a golf course; equestrian trails; sport venues, including a tennis stadium which hosts major professional events; a nature center and planetarium; the Carter Barron Amphitheatre, an outdoor concert venue; and picnic and playground facilities. Rock Creek Park also maintains cultural exhibits, including the Peirce Mill. Rock Creek is a popular venue for jogging, cycling, and inline skating, especially on the long, winding Beach Drive, portions of which are closed to vehicles on weekends.

A number of the city&#x27;s outstanding bridges, such as the Lauzun&#x27;s Legion, Dumbarton, Taft and the Duke Ellington bridges, span the creek and ravine.

Among the park&#x27;s few monuments is a pink granite bench on Beach Drive south of the Peirce Mill, dedicated on November 7, 1936, by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt in memory of former French ambassador Jean Jules Jusserand. In 2014, it was named &quot;best obscure memorial&quot; by &quot;Washington City Paper&quot;.

=== Horse Center ===
Rock Creek Park Horse Center, founded in 1972, is located in the middle of the park near the Nature Center. The barn, run by Guest Services Inc, has 57 stalls, two outdoor rings, one indoor ring, and three bluestone turnout paddocks. The stable provides trail rides, pony rides, and lessons for the public, along with boarding for private horses. The stable primarily teaches English riding, with an emphasis on lower-level jumping and dressage.

The barn is also home to Rock Creek Riders, a therapeutic riding program for adults and children with special needs in the D.C. area. Past participants in the program include brain-injured veterans of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan and people with autism, cerebral palsy, or attention deficit disorder. The program is volunteer-run and relies on donations and contributions for funding. Previously, Rock Creek Riders has worked with the United States Mounted Police, National Park Service, Wounded Warrior Project, and the Caisson Platoon Equine Assisted Programs to provide these therapeutic riding services.

=== Peirce Mill ===

Peirce Mill is a water-powered grist mill in Rock Creek Park. There were at least eight mills along Rock Creek within what is now Washington, D.C., and many more farther upstream in Montgomery County, Maryland. Of those eight, only Peirce Mill is still standing.

It was built in the 1820s by Isaac Peirce, along with a house, barn, and other buildings. It was later owned by a son, Joshua Peirce, and a nephew Peirce Shoemaker. It became part of Rock Creek Park in 1892.

The mill was listed on the National Register in 1969 as Peirce Mill. It was repaired and re-opened October 15, 2011.

The Peirce Carriage Barn, adjacent to the mill, is the National Park Service point of contact. The barn was part of the Peirce estate built in 1810 and used as a tack room and carriage barn. The barn is now a mini-museum containing information on the milling process, the Peirce family estate and other mills along the Rock Creek Valley.

=== Rock Creek multi-use trails ===

A set of hiker/biker trails in the park serve both commuters and recreational users. The mainline trail extends for about from Broad Branch Road to the southern end of the park where the trail continues several miles to Arlington Memorial Bridge and Hains Point. The northern trails consist of a loop along Bingham Road, Oregon Avenue, Beach Road, and Military Road with spurs along Oregon to the Nature Center and Wise Road. In the park, the mainline trail starts at the parking lot just west of the creek and south of Broad Branch. From there, it is co-located with a section of the Western Ridge Trail south past Peirce Mill to a trail bridge over the creek, where the two separate. After a short distance on the east side of the creek, it crosses back to the west side on Bluff Bridge. Dating back to 1934, it is the oldest part of the trail in the park, and the same age as the Devil&#x27;s Chair and Saddle Club Bridges farther south. The trail remains on the west side until just south of Klingle Bridge where it crosses back to the east and leaves the park to enter the Zoo property.

The Park Service began to experiment with trails in August 1963 when mile-long Ross Drive was closed to cars from 6 am to noon on Sundays, but planning for a separate trail system didn&#x27;t begin until 1965, when the federal &quot;Trails for America&quot; report identified a trail along Rock Creek as one of many trails for the D.C. area. That same year, the &quot;Fort Park System, A Re-evaluation Study of Fort Drive, Washington, D.C.&quot; report suggested running the Circle Fort Trail through the park.

Planning for trails led to action. In January 1967, NPS announced weekend road closures in April over a 5-mile loop in the center of the park, made up of Beach, Ross, Ridge and Joyce and they announced a plan to build a trail from Military Road to the District boundary. That trail, the first hiker-biker trail in the park, was built in the summer of 1967. The crushed bluestone trail was constructed from the Nature Center, past Wise Road to a turnaround loop just southwest of Beach Drive and the D.C. boundary.
Over the next few months, NPS announced plans to add additional unpaved trails along Military Road from Oregon to Beach, along Wise to Fenwick Branch, beside Fenwick Branch to the District boundary and through Pinehurst Parkway Park (most of which were never constructed). In 1968, they built a second trail along Beach from Joyce to Bingham. By 1969, the two existing northern trails were connected with a trail along Bingham from Oregon to Beach. Later that year, NPS built the final section of the loop along Military between Oregon and Beach. By 1972, NPS had paved all of these trails except the section north of Wise to the DC Boundary. The section along Military Road was originally intended to serve as part of the Fort Circle Trail, passing by Fort DeRussy, but work on the Fort Circle Trail ended in the 1970s with only three parts, the one in Rock Creek, a section of the C&amp;O Canal towpath and another from Fort Stanton to Fort Mahon, completed. Over time, the Rock Creek section ceased to be viewed as part of the Fort Circle Trail system. Between 1979 and 1981, the unpaved trail and turnaround loop north of Wise was abandoned.

Farther south, a trail along the creek was extended into the park in 1972. A trail along the Potomac built prior to 1967 was extended along the Rock Creek and Potomac Parkway in 1971 and then into the park in 1972. It was built on a bridle path that dated back to the early 20th century up to the Bluff Bridge, which was built in 1934. The section of bridle path used between P and Q streets was built in conjunction with the Pentagon, as that project needed dirt and the park service needed dirt removed. These first sections of trail were 4 to 8 feet wide with rough pavement, steep slopes, poor visibility and sharp curves. By 1977, the trail was extended to Broad Branch Road, crossing the creek at Bluff Bridge and twice on newly constructed &quot;breakaway&quot; bridges.
NPS and cyclists have long sought a way to close the gap on the north end of the park. After a 1973 proposal to extend the trail, NPS launched a study and announced a plan to do so in 1983, but quickly retracted it. In 1980, NPS, inspired by road closures in New York&#x27;s Central Park, prepared an assessment of alternatives for a Bicycle Trail Study of the park that analyzed nine alternatives for completing the trail system, including construction of a new bike trail and alteration of the existing road network. After a period of public comment, NPS proposed expanding the weekend closure; constructing an additional of trail, designating Beach Drive north of Bingham a bicycle route and studying the suitability of a trail in that section. After years of additional study, public hearings and trial closures, NPS announced in February 1983 a plan to expand weekend closures and close Beach between Joyce and Broad Branch to automobile traffic. At first only one lane of Beach would be closed during rush hour, but after Metro&#x27;s Red Line opened in Montgomery County in 1985, the section would be permanently closed. Six months later, under pressure from The American Automobile Association and the governments of D.C. and Montgomery County, the park service decided not to close the section of Beach. Instead, they decided to go ahead with the weekend closures and build a bicycle trail along a horse trail between Joyce and Broad Branch by 1986. But that trail was never built.

In 1982, the Park Service built two new bridges for the trail. One was added across Rock Creek when the road bridge between Pennsylvania Avenue and K Street was rebuilt, enabling the trail to stop using a narrow section of the road bridge. As well, a high-water bridge was built just south of Peirce Mill, replacing the low-water breakaway bridge that had been washed away by Hurricane David in 1979.

By 1990, biking on foot trails or bridle paths was no longer allowed. 

In 1991, a high-water bridge replaced the trail bridge beneath Porter Road, the other low-water breakaway bridge built in the 1970s.

The prospect of completing a bike route across the park re-emerged in the 1990s when the park was required to come up with a General Management Plan. In 1991, a loosely knit, cyclist-dominated group called &quot;Auto-Free D.C.&quot; renewed the push to ban automobile traffic on Beach Drive. They suggested limited road closures to discourage commuters, but allow access to most locations in the park by car. When NPS failed to take up their suggestion, the group led a series of &quot;rolling road block&quot; protests which aimed to peaceably draw attention to the cause by disrupting rush hour traffic. Nonetheless, the protests led to some confrontations and arrests, and at one point the Military Road Bridge was graffitied with anti-automobile slogans. In 1996, NPS initiated a federally mandated General Management Plan for the park. In June 1997, NPS laid out several management alternatives, one of which would improve and expand the paved multi-use trails and add a new trail along Wise, with the police substation converted to a visitor center and bicycle rental facility. Another alternative suggested that sections of Beach Drive be permanently closed and converted into a wide multi-use trail and that Wise Road, Sherrill Drive, Bingham Drive, Grant Road, and Blagden Avenue be converted to paved trails. Both of these alternatives were less popular than the status quo. An additional alternative created by the People&#x27;s Alliance for Rock Creek (PARC), a group consisting of the Washington Area Bicyclists Association, the Sierra Club, Friends of the Earth and 18 other advocacy groups, suggested making Beach Drive auto-free north of Broad Branch as a means of completing the trail envisioned in 1965. In 2003, in an attempt to appease both groups, the Park Service proposed extending the weekend closures of Beach Drive to weekdays from 9:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. The proposal was one of several, but was the &quot;preferred alternative.&quot; The plan had popular support, but no political support. Mayor Anthony Williams who had supported closure as a candidate, opposed it as mayor, citing the need to evacuate in a post-9/11 world. In May 2004, NPS proposed instead to only close the section from Joyce to Broad Branch, but again found opposition among politicians. So, in November 2005, the Park Service finalized their management plan which included no further road closures, the prospect of lowering speed limits and adding speed bumps, and improvements to the trail south of Broad Branch. However, speed limits were never reduced and no traffic calming was ever implemented.

The management plan completion cleared the way for the Park Service and DDOT to rebuild Beach Drive and the trail. Despite planning that started in 2005, work on the project didn&#x27;t begin until September 22, 2016. The project rebuilt both Beach Drive and the trail. The trail section between Shoreham Drive and Broad Branch was widened to , repaved and realigned; the Shoreham Drive crossing, reworked in 2006, was again improved; the traffic lanes in the Zoo Tunnel were narrowed to widen the trail through it by ; a new access to Harvard Street was built and of new trail was constructed between the Porter Street Bridge and Bluff Bridge. In conjunction with the project, the trail through the Klingle Road intersection was redesigned to connect to the new Klingle Valley Trail, which was built on the washed out section of Klingle Road and opened on June 24, 2017. The work on the trail south of Broad Branch was completed on January 8, 2018. Work on Beach Drive between Joyce and Bingham, which improved a short section of trail near the bridge over the creek was completed on September 27, 2019.

In 2018, DDOT announced plans to rehabilitate and expand the trail within both Rock Creek Park and outside of it. Within Rock Creek Park, they will rehabilitate a section between Klingle Road and Bluff Bridge and a section on the west side of the creek south of Broad Branch Road. They will also build a new trail along Piney Ridge Road from Beach Drive to Arkansas Avenue.

Though the 2005 D.C. bicycle plan only identified a need for &quot;an improved bicycle connection&quot; between Broad Branch and the Maryland Line, the 2013 MoveDC Multi-modal transportation plan includes a future trail on this section.

Sections of park roads have been subject to weekly closures to motor vehicles since the 1960s, though the times and locations changed. After the 1963 closure experiment, another was attempted in 1967 on Beach between Joyce and Broad Branch on Sunday mornings, but the response was not positive and it was discontinued. In 1970, NPS tried again, closing of Beach, and part of Morrow, every Sunday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., but was again discontinued due to a lack of use. But, in 1972, NPS tried for a fourth time, again closing Beach between Broad Branch and Joyce from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Sundays and it became a permanent feature. On more than one occasion in the 1970s they experimented with Saturday closures in the summer, once to support a new bicycle concession near Carter Barron, which generated no negative response, but also little use. By 1980, they added the section from Tilden to Piney Branch Road and expanded the hours to 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. and in August 1981, they expanded the closure to Saturdays and holidays as an experiment. In July 1982, the weekend automobile ban was extended to the section of Beach from Picnic Grove 10 to Wise, and between West Beach and the D.C. boundary. In August 1983 they made the closures, between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. every Saturday and Sunday, official policy as part of the scaled back 1983 Plan. In 1985, the hours were increased from 7 a.m. Saturday to 7 p.m. Sunday from early April to Veterans Day on upper Beach Drive and year-round between Joyce and Broad Branch roads. By 1998 the closures had expanded to include not just the three sections of Beach but also the entirety of Bingham and Sherril Drives within the park and last all year long.

== Administration ==
As originally authorized by Congress, the park was governed by the Rock Creek Park Commission, comprising the Chief of Engineers of the Army, the engineer commissioner of the District of Columbia, and three presidential appointees. In 1933, the park, along with other National Capital Parks, was transferred to the jurisdiction of the National Park Service. The park is patrolled by the United States Park Police.

&quot;Rock Creek Park&quot; is also an administrative unit of the National Park Service responsible for administration of 99 properties in the District of Columbia north and west of the National Mall and Memorial Parks. The properties include various parks, parkways, buildings, circles, triangles, memorials, and statues and include:

== Geography ==
Although D.C.&#x27;s primary geographic metonyms for racial and class divisions are the city&#x27;s quadrants (&quot;i.e.&quot;, Northwest, Southwest, Northeast, and Southeast), Rock Creek Park also separates prominent neighborhoods such as Georgetown, Cathedral Heights and Spring Valley from the rest of the city; hence, the designations WOTP (West of the Park) and EOTP (East of the Park) also serve this role.

== Legislative history ==
Congressional authorizations:
* Rock Creek Park – September 27, 1890
* Meridian Hill Park – June 25, 1910
* Montrose Park – March 2, 1911
* Rock Creek and Potomac Parkway – March 4, 1913
* Dumbarton Oaks Park – December 2, 1940

<text>Palo Alto ( ; Spanish for ) is a charter city in the northwestern corner of Santa Clara County, California, United States, in the San Francisco Bay Area, named after a coastal redwood tree known as El Palo Alto.

The city of Palo Alto was incorporated in 1894 by the American industrialist Leland Stanford and his wife, Jane Stanford, when they founded Stanford University in memory of their only child, Leland Stanford Jr. Palo Alto later expanded and now borders East Palo Alto, Mountain View, Los Altos, Los Altos Hills, Stanford, Portola Valley, and Menlo Park. As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 68,572. Palo Alto has one of the highest costs of living in the United States, and its residents are among the most educated in the country. However, it has a youth suicide rate four times higher than the national average, often attributed to academic pressure.

As one of the principal cities of Silicon Valley, Palo Alto is home to the headquarters of multiple tech companies, including HP, Space Systems/Loral, VMware, and PARC. Palo Alto has also served as headquarters or the founding location of several other tech companies, including Apple, Google, Facebook, Logitech, Tesla, Intuit, IDEO, Pinterest, and PayPal. Ford Motor Company and Lockheed Martin each additionally maintain major research and technology facilities within Palo Alto.

== History ==

Before the arrival of Europeans, the Ohlone lived on the San Francisco peninsula; in particular, the Puichon Ohlone lived in the Palo Alto area. The area of modern Palo Alto was first recorded by the 1769 party of Gaspar de Portolá, a 64-man, 200-horse expedition setting out from San Diego to find Monterey Bay. The group trekked past the bay without recognizing it and continued north. When they reached modern-day Pacifica, they ascended Sweeney Ridge and saw the San Francisco Bay on November 2. Portolá descended from Sweeney Ridge southeast down San Andreas Creek to Laguna Creek (now Crystal Springs Reservoir), thence to the San Francisquito Creek watershed, ultimately camping from November 6–11, 1769, by a tall redwood later to be known as El Palo Alto.

In 1777, Father Junipero Serra established the Mission Santa Clara de Asis, whose northern boundary was San Francisquito Creek and whose lands included modern Palo Alto. The area was under the control of the viceroy of Mexico and ultimately under the control of Spain. On November 29, 1777, Pueblo de San Jose de Guadalupe (now the city of San Jose a few miles to the south of what was to be Palo Alto) was established by order of the viceroy despite the displeasure of the local mission. The Mexican War of Independence ending in 1821 led to Mexico becoming an independent country, though San Jose did not recognize rule by the new Mexico until May 10, 1825. Mexico proceeded to sell off or grant much of the mission land.

During the Mexican–American War, the United States seized Alta California in 1846; however, this was not legalized until the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was signed on July 4, 1848. Mexican citizens in the area could choose to become United States citizens and their land grants were to be recognized if they chose to do so (though many legal disputes arose over this).

The land grant, Rancho Rinconada del Arroyo de San Francisquito, of about on the lower reaches of San Francisquito Creek (i.e., parts of modern Menlo Park and northern Palo Alto) was given to Maria Antonia Mesa in 1841. She and her husband Rafael Soto (who had died in 1839) had settled in 1835 near present-day Newell and Middlefield roads and sold supplies. In 1839, their daughter María Luisa Soto (1817–1883) married John Coppinger, who was to be, in 1841, the grantee of Rancho Cañada de Raymundo (in modern San Mateo county). Upon Coppinger&#x27;s death in 1847, Maria inherited it and later married a visiting boat captain, John Greer. Greer owned a home on the site that is now Town &amp; Country Village on Embarcadero and El Camino Real. Greer Avenue and Court are named for him.

To the south of the Sotos, the brothers Secundino and Teodoro Robles in 1849 bought Rancho Rincon de San Francisquito from José Peña, the 1841 grantee. The grant covered the area south of Rancho Rinconada del Arroyo de San Francisquito to more or less present-day Mountain View. The grant was bounded on the south by Mariano Castro&#x27;s Rancho Pastoria de las Borregas grant across San Antonio Road. This later became the Robles Rancho, which constitutes about 80% of Palo Alto and Stanford University today. In 1863, it was whittled down in the courts to . Stories say the grand hacienda was built on the former meager adobe of José Peña near Ferne off San Antonio Road, midway between Middlefield and Alma Street. Their hacienda hosted fiestas and bull fights. It was ruined in the 1906 earthquake and its lumber was used to build a large barn nearby, which was said to have lingered until the early 1950s. On April 10, 1853, , comprising the present-day Barron Park, Matadero Creek and Stanford Business Park, was sold for $2,000 to Elisha Oscar Crosby, who called his new property Mayfield Farm. The name of Mayfield was later attached to the community that started nearby. On September 23, 1856, the Crosby land was transferred to Sarah Wallis to satisfy a debt he owed her. In 1880, Secundino Robles, father to twenty-nine children, still lived just south of Palo Alto, near the location of the present-day San Antonio Shopping Center in Mountain View.

Many of the Spanish names in the Palo Alto area represent the local heritage, descriptive terms, and former residents. Pena Court, Miranda Avenue, which was essentially Foothill Expressway, was the married name of Juana Briones and the name occurs in Courts and Avenues and other street names in Palo Alto and Mountain View in the quadrant where she owned vast areas between Stanford University, Grant Road in Mountain View and west of El Camino Real. Yerba Buena was to her credit. Rinconada was the major Mexican land grant name.

The township of Mayfield was formed in 1855, around the site of a stagecoach stop and saloon known as &quot;Uncle Jim&#x27;s Cabin&quot; near the intersection of El Camino Real and today&#x27;s California Avenue in what is now southern Palo Alto. In October 1863 the San Francisco to San Jose railroad had been built as far as Mayfield and service started between San Francisco and Mayfield (the station is now California Avenue); train service all the way to San Jose started in January 1864. El Camino became Main Street; the northeast–southwest cross streets were named for Civil War heroes, with California Avenue originally being Lincoln Street. The town had its own newspaper by 1869 (the &quot;Mayfield Enterprise&quot;, in English and Spanish), incorporated in 1903, and had breweries and a cannery.

In 1875, French financier Jean Baptiste Paulin Caperon, better known as Peter Coutts, purchased land in Mayfield and four other parcels around three sides of today&#x27;s College Terrace – more than a thousand acres (4.0 km2) extending from today&#x27;s Page Mill Road to Serra Street and from El Camino Real to the foothills. Coutts named his property Ayrshire Farm. Leland Stanford started buying land in the area in 1876 for a horse farm, called the Palo Alto Stock Farm. Stanford bought Ayrshire Farm in 1882.

=== Creation of the town ===

In 1884, Leland and Jane Stanford lost their only child Leland Stanford Jr. when he died of typhoid fever at age 15 and decided to create a university in his memory. In 1886, they proposed having the university&#x27;s gateway be Mayfield. However, they had one condition: alcohol had to be banned from the town. Known for its 13 rowdy saloons, Mayfield rejected his request. This led them to drive the formation of a new temperance town with the help of their friend Timothy Hopkins of the Southern Pacific Railroad, who in 1887 bought of private land for the new townsite. This Hopkins Tract, bounded by El Camino Real, San Francisquito Creek, Boyce, Channing, Melville, and Hopkins Avenues, and Embarcadero Road, was proclaimed a local Heritage District during Palo Alto&#x27;s centennial in 1994. The Stanfords set up their university, Stanford University, and a train stop (on University Avenue) by the new town. This new community was initially called University Park (the name &quot;Palo Alto&quot; at that time was attached to what is now College Terrace), but was incorporated in 1894 with the name Palo Alto. With the Stanfords&#x27; support, Palo Alto grew to the size of Mayfield. Mayfield eventually passed an ordinance banning saloons that took effect in January 1905.

=== Later history ===

On July 2, 1925, Palo Alto voters approved the annexation of Mayfield and the two communities were officially consolidated on July 6, 1925. As a result, Palo Alto has two downtown areas: one along University Avenue and one along California Avenue (renamed after the annexation since Palo Alto already had a Lincoln Avenue).

The &quot;Mayfield News&quot; wrote its own obituary four days later:
Palo Alto continued to annex more land, including the Stanford Shopping Center area in 1953. Stanford Research Park, Embarcadero Road northeast of Bayshore, and the West Bayshore/San Antonio Road area were also annexed during the 1950s. Large amounts of land west of Foothill Expressway were annexed between 1959 and 1968; this is mostly undeveloped and includes Foothills Park and Arastradero Preserve. The last major annexations were of Barron Park in 1975 and, in 1979, a large area of marshlands bordering the bay.

Many of Stanford University&#x27;s first faculty members settled in the Professorville neighborhood of Palo Alto. Professorville, now a registered national historic district, is bounded by Kingsley, Lincoln, and Addison Avenues and the cross streets of Ramona, Bryant, and Waverley. The district includes a large number of well-preserved residences dating from the 1890s, including 833 Kingsley, 345 Lincoln, and 450 Kingsley. 1044 Bryant was the home of Russell Varian, co-inventor of the Klystron tube. The Federal Telegraph laboratory site, situated at 218 Channing, is a California Historical Landmark recognizing Lee de Forest&#x27;s 1911 invention of the vacuum tube and electronic oscillator at that location. While not open to the public, the garage that housed the launch of Hewlett Packard is located at 367 Addison Avenue. Hewlett Packard recently restored the house and garage. A second historic district on Ramona Street can be found downtown between University and Hamilton Avenues. The Palo Alto Chinese School is the oldest in the entire Bay Area. It is also home to the second oldest opera company in California, the West Bay Opera.

One early major business was when Thomas Foon Chew, owner of the Bayside Canning Company in Alviso founded by his father, expanded his business by starting a cannery in 1918 in what was then Mayfield that initially employed 350 workers but later expanded. In the 1920s the Bayside Canning Company became one of the largest in the world. In 1949 the Palo Alto cannery, now part of the Sutter Packing Company under the ownership of Safeway, closed; at the time it was the largest employer in Palo Alto with about a 1,000 workers. Various businesses used the building since including Fry&#x27;s Electronics.

Palo Alto is also home to a long-standing baseball tradition. The Palo Alto Oaks are a collegiate summer baseball club that has been in the Bay Area since 1950, eight years longer than the San Francisco Giants. The Oaks were originally managed by Tony Makjavich for 49 years. The Oaks were going to fold before the summer 2016 season but were taken on by Daniel Palladino and Whaylan Price, Bay Area baseball coaches who did not want to see the team die. The Oaks have a rich history within the Palo Alto community.

==Geography==

Palo Alto is situated in the southeastern section of the San Francisco Peninsula.

It consists of two large parcels of land connected by a narrow corridor. The southern inland section, located south of Interstate 280, is hilly, rural, and lightly populated and is the site of Pearson–Arastradero Preserve and Foothills Park both part of the Palo Alto park system and also large parts of the Los Trancos and Monte Bello Open Space Preserves part of the Midpeninsula Regional Open Space District. The city extends as far as Skyline Boulevard along the ridge of the Santa Cruz Mountains.

The northern more densely populated parcel is bordered by San Francisquito Creek (with Menlo Park and East Palo Alto in adjacent San Mateo County beyond) to the north, San Francisco Bay to the north-east, Mountain View, Los Altos, and Los Altos Hills to the east and south-east and Stanford University to the south-west and west. Several major transit routes cross this parcel from the north-west to the south-east. The biggest and closest to the bay is the Bayshore Freeway and going inland are Alma Street/Central Expressway, El Camino Real, and Foothill Expressway. Interstate 280 is parallel and crosses the narrow corridor of land that connects the two parcels that makeup Palo Alto. Somewhat perpendicular to these roads are Sand Hill Road from El Camino until it crosses San Francisquito Creek into Menlo Park, Embarcadero Road, Oregon Expressway/Page Mill Road, Arastradero Road/East Charleston Road, and San Antonio Road (the last forms part of the boundary with Mountain View).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and , comprising 7.38%, is water.

The official elevation is above sea level, but the city boundaries reach well into the northern section of the Santa Cruz Mountains.

===Water===
Palo Alto is crossed by several creeks that flow north in the direction of the San Francisco Bay, Adobe Creek near its eastern boundary, San Francisquito Creek on its western boundary, and Matadero Creek in between the other two. Arastradero Creek is a tributary to Matadero Creek, and Barron Creek is now diverted to Adobe Creek just south of Highway 101 by a diversion channel. The San Francisquito Creek mainstem is formed by the confluence of Corte Madera Creek and Bear Creek not far below Searsville Dam. Further downstream, Los Trancos Creek is a tributary to San Francisquito Creek below Interstate 280.

===Environmental features===
Palo Alto has a number of significant natural habitats, including estuarine, riparian, and oak forest. Many of these habitats are visible in Foothills Park, which is owned by the city. The Charleston Slough contains a rich marsh and littoral zone, providing feeding areas for a variety of shorebirds and other estuarine wildlife.

===Climate===
Typical of the South Peninsula region of the San Francisco Bay Area, Palo Alto has a Mediterranean climate with mild, moderately wet winters and warm, dry summers. Typically, in the warmer months, as the sun goes down, the fog bank flows over the foothills to the west and covers the night sky, thus creating a blanket that helps trap the summer warmth absorbed during the day. Even so, it is rare for the overnight low temperature to exceed .

In January, average daily temperatures range from a low of to a high of . In July, average temperatures range from . The record high temperature was on September 6, 2022, and the record low temperature was on January 11, 1949, and December 24, 1990. Temperatures reach or higher on an average of 12.0 days. Temperatures drop to or lower on an average of 14.0 days.

Due to the Santa Cruz Mountains to the west, there is a &quot;rain shadow&quot; in Palo Alto, resulting in an average annual rainfall of only . Measurable rainfall occurs on an average of 55.8 days annually. The wettest year on record was 1983 with and the driest year was 2013 with . The most rainfall in one month was in February 1998 and the most rainfall in one day was on February 3, 1998. Measurable snowfall is very rare in the populated areas of Palo Alto, but fell on January 21, 1962. A dusting of snow occasionally occurs in the highest (unpopulated) section of Palo Alto near Skyline Ridge, where the elevation reaches up to .

According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Palo Alto has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Csb).

==Local government==

Palo Alto was incorporated in 1894. In 1909 a municipal charter created a local government consisting of a fifteen-member city council, with responsibilities for various governmental functions delegated to appointed committees. In 1950, the city adopted a Council–manager government. Several appointed committees continue to advise the city council on specialized issues, such as land-use planning, utilities, and libraries, but these committees no longer have direct authority over City staff. Currently, the city council has seven members.

The mayor and vice-mayor serve one year at a time, with terms ending in January. General municipal elections are held in November of even-numbered years. Council terms are four years long.

According to one study in 2015, the city&#x27;s effective property tax rate of 0.42% was the lowest of the California cities included in the study.

==Politics==
In the California State Legislature, Palo Alto is in , and in .

In the United States House of Representatives, Palo Alto is in .

According to the California Secretary of State, as of February 10, 2019, Palo Alto has 40,040 registered voters. Of those, 20,857 (52.1%) are registered Democrats, 4,689 (11.7%) are registered Republicans, and 13,520 (33.8%) have declined to state a political party.

==Housing==

Palo Alto, north of Oregon Expressway, is filled with older homes, including Craftsman and California Colonials, some of which date back to the 1890s but most of which were built in the first four decades of the 20th century. South of Oregon Expressway, the homes, including many Joseph Eichler-designed or Eichler-style houses, were primarily built in the first 20 years after World War II.

While the city contains homes that now cost anywhere from $800,000 to well over $40 million, much of Palo Alto&#x27;s housing stock is in the style of California mid-century middle-class suburbia. The median home sale price for all of Palo Alto was $1.2 million in 2007 and $1.4 million in July 2009. Palo Alto ranked in as the 5th most expensive city in the United States , with an average home sales price of $1,677,000. In 2010, Palo Alto ranked as the 2nd most expensive city in the United States, with a four-bedroom, two-bathroom home listing for $1.48 million on average. Palo Alto is by some measures the most expensive college town in the United States.

By 2020, residents&#x27; opposition to new housing has resulted in Palo Alto only allowing construction of enough low-income housing to meet 13% of its state-mandated share, and 6% of its share for very-low-income housing.

===History of housing===
In the 1920s, racial covenants were used that banned &quot;persons of African, Japanese, Chinese, or Mongolian descent&quot; from purchasing or renting homes in many neighborhoods throughout Palo Alto. In the 1950s, some movements opposed these policies, including the Palo Alto Fair Play Association, as well as architect and developer Joseph Eichler, who built almost 3,000 homes in Palo Alto.

Blockbusting strategies were also employed to instill fear in white neighborhoods and cause White flight out of areas on the outskirts of the city. Blockbusting refers to a practice realtors adopted in which they would advertise the incoming presence of a black family to a neighborhood, causing panic among the white residents who would consequently sell their houses at deflated prices very quickly. One famous blockbusting event is responsible for the prevailing demographic divides between Palo Alto and East Palo Alto.

One of the most destructive policies at the time was redlining. Redlining was a policy put in place by the Federal Housing Association starting in 1937. Through the program, the association could rank neighborhoods from Type A, which was desirable, to Type D (outlined in red) which was deemed hazardous. Residents in Type D neighborhoods were ineligible for loans to buy or fix houses. The program was implemented in a way so that neighborhoods with any kind of African American population were ranked type C or D. This was also the case in Palo Alto and the surrounding areas. Palo Alto&#x27;s White neighborhoods were ranked mostly Type A and B, allowing for wealth accumulation and eventually resulting in the high housing prices we see today. On the other hand, the surrounding areas were all marked Type C and D, and African Americans found themselves being driven to the outskirts of Palo Alto, what is now mostly East Palo Alto, where there was no money from loans in the economy, leading to a state of decay.

However, for the most part, Palo Alto&#x27;s housing was built on policies that are still reflected in the current demographics.

==Economy==
Palo Alto serves as a central economic focal point of the Silicon Valley and is home to more than 7,000 businesses employing more than 98,000 people. In the mid-1950s Palo Alto had a railroad village feel and the streets were lined with bungalows and prim storefronts. At a time when only 7 percent of American adults had completed four years of college, more than a third of men living in the Palo Alto suburb had a college degree. In 1949 Wallace Sterling had been appointed as Stanford&#x27;s president and Frederick Terman became provost. The fledgling Stanford University was reorganized, offering applied educational programs on physics, material science, and electrical engineering. Stanford&#x27;s basic research capabilities were built up and the laboratory facilities for applied work were brought together in the Stanford Electronics Laboratories.

Many prominent technology firms reside in the Stanford Research Park on Page Mill Road, while nearby Sand Hill Road in the adjacent city of Menlo Park is a notable hub of venture capitalists.

A number of prominent Silicon Valley companies no longer reside primarily in Palo Alto. These include Google (now in Mountain View), Facebook (now in Menlo Park), and PayPal (now in San Jose).

In 2021, Tesla, Inc. moved its headquarters from Palo Alto to Austin, Texas.

Palo Alto&#x27;s retail and restaurant trade includes Stanford Shopping Center, an upscale open air shopping center established in 1955, and downtown Palo Alto, centered on University Avenue.

Palo Alto is the location of the first street-level Apple Store, the first Apple mini store, the first West Coast Whole Foods Market store, and the first Victoria&#x27;s Secret.

===Top employers===

According to the city&#x27;s 2023 Annual Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the top employers in the city are:

==Utilities==
Palo Alto has a city-run and owned utility, City of Palo Alto Utilities (CPAU), which provides water, electric, gas service, and waste water disposal within city limits, with the minor exception of a rural portion of the city in the hills west of Interstate 280, past the Country Club, which does not receive gas from the city. Almost all other communities in northern California depend on Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&amp;E) for gas and electricity.

Water and Gas Services (WGS) operates gas and water distribution networks within the city limits. The city operates both gas meters and the distribution pipelines. Water comes from city-operated watershed and wells and the City and County of San Francisco Hetch Hetchy system. The city is located in Santa Clara Valley Water District, North Zone. Hetch Hetchy pipeline #3 and #4 pass through the city.

The city operates its own electric power distribution network and telemetry cable network. Interconnection points tie the city into PG&amp;E&#x27;s electric transmission system, which brings power from several sources to the city. Palo Alto is a member of a joint powers authority (the Northern California Power Agency), which cooperatively generates electricity for government power providers such as the City of Santa Clara, the City of Redding, and the Port of Oakland. Roughly the same group of entities operate the Transmission Agency of Northern California (TANC). TANC transports power over its own lines from as far as British Columbia through an interconnection with the federal Bonneville Power Administration. A local oddity is a series of joint poles; those primary conductor cross arms are marked PGE and CPA (City of Palo Alto) to identify each utility&#x27;s side of the shared cross arms.

Palo Alto has an ongoing community debate about the city providing fiber optic connectivity to all residences. A series of pilot programs have been proposed. One proposal called for the city to install dark fiber, which would be made live by a contractor.

Services traditionally attributed to a cable television provider were sold to a regulated commercial concern. Previously the cable system was operated by a cooperative called Palo Alto Cable Coop.

The former Regional Bell Operating Company in Palo Alto was Pacific Telephone, now called AT&amp;T Inc., and previously called SBC and Pacific Bell. One of the earliest central office facilities switching Palo Alto calls is the historic Davenport central office (CO) at 529 Bryant Street. The building was sold and is now the home of the Palo Alto Internet Exchange. The former CO building is marked by a bronze plaque and is located on the north side of Bryant Street between University Avenue and Hamilton Avenue. It was called Davenport after the exchange name at the introduction of dial telephone service in Palo Alto. For example, modern numbers starting with 325- were Davenport 5 in the 1950s and &#x27;60s. The Step-by-Step office was scrapped and replaced by stored-program-controlled equipment at a different location about 1980. Stanford calls ran on a Step-by-Step Western Electric 701 PBX until the university purchased its own switch about 1980. It had the older, traditional Bell System 600 Hz+120 Hz dial tone. The old 497-number PBX, MDF, and battery string were housed in a steel building at 333 Bonair Siding. From the 1950s to 1980s, the bulk of Palo Alto calls were switched on Number 5 Crossbar systems. By the mid-1980s, these electromechanical systems had been junked. Under the Bell System&#x27;s regulated monopoly, local coin telephone calls were ten cents until the early 1980s.

During the drought of the early 1990s, Palo Alto employed water waste patrol officers to enforce water saving regulations. The team, called &quot;Gush Busters&quot;, patrolled city streets looking for broken water pipes and poorly managed irrigation systems. Regulations were set to stop restaurants from habitually serving water, runoff from irrigation, and irrigation during the day. The main goal of the team was to educate the public in ways to save water. Citations consisted of Friendly Reminder postcards and more formal notices. To help promote the conservation message, the team only used bicycles and mopeds.

==Fire and police departments==

The city was among the first in Santa Clara County to offer advanced life support (ALS) paramedic-level (EMT-P) ambulance service. In an arrangement predating countywide paramedic service, Palo Alto Fire operates two paramedic ambulances which are theoretically shared with county EMS assets. The Palo Alto Fire Department is currently the only fire department in Santa Clara County that routinely transports patients. Rural Metro holds the Santa Clara County 911 contract and provides transportation in other cities. Enhanced 9-1-1 arrived in about 1980 and included the then-new ability to report emergencies from coin telephones without using a coin. Palo Alto Fire also has a contract with Stanford University to cover most of the campus. In all, the Fire Department has six regular stations plus one opened only during the summer fire season in the foothills.

The police station was originally housed in a stone building at 450 Bryant Street. Still engraved with the words &quot;Police Court&quot;, the building is now a non-profit senior citizen center, Avenidas. The police are now headquartered in the City Hall high rise. The department has just under 100 sworn officers ranking supplemented by approximately ten reserve officers and professional staff who support the police department and the animal services organization.

== Education ==

===Higher education===
Palo Alto is home to Palo Alto University, a school focused on psychology.

The main academic campus of Stanford University, a private research university, is adjacent to Palo Alto. The university also includes lands in the Palo Alto city limits.

== Libraries ==

The Palo Alto City Library has five branches, with a total of 265,000 items in their collections. The Mitchell Park Library was rebuilt between 2010 and December 2014 to become the largest in Palo Alto. The former Main Library was then renamed the Rinconada branch. Palo Alto Children&#x27;s Library is located close to the former Main Library. There are smaller branches in the Downtown and College Terrace neighborhoods.

==Media==

The &quot;Palo Alto Daily Post&quot; publishes six days a week. &quot;Palo Alto Daily News&quot;, a unit of the San Jose Mercury News, publishes five days a week.&quot; Palo Alto Weekly&quot; is published on Fridays. &quot;Palo Alto Times&quot;, a daily newspaper, served Palo Alto and neighboring cities beginning in 1894. In 1979, it became the &quot;Peninsula Times Tribune&quot;. The newspaper ceased publication in 1993.

KDOW, 1220 AM, began broadcasting in 1949 as KIBE. It later became KDFC, simulcasting classical KDFC-FM. As KDOW it broadcasts a business news format. The transmitter is in East Palo Alto near the western approach to the Dumbarton Bridge. Power is 5,000 watts daytime and 145 watts nighttime. KZSU at 90.1 FM is owned by Stanford University. KFJC at 89.7 FM is licensed to nearby Los Altos and is licensed to the Foothill-De Anza Community College District.

KTLN-TV, virtual channel 68, transmits from Mt. Allison across San Francisco bay, east of Palo Alto.

The Midpeninsula Community Media Center provides public, educational, and government access (PEG) cable television channels 26, 28, 29, 30 and 75.

==Transportation==
===Roads===
Palo Alto is served by two major freeways, Highway 101 and Interstate 280 and is traversed by the Peninsula&#x27;s main north–south boulevard, El Camino Real (SR 82). Santa Clara County maintains 2 expressways in Palo Alto; Route G3 is the city&#x27;s main east–west route and is the only road in the city that connects the two freeways directly. Route G6 travels through the city as Alma Street, serving as an alternate route to SR 82. The city is also served indirectly by State Route 84 which traverses the Dumbarton Bridge to the north, and State Route 85 via Mountain View to the south.

There are no parking meters in Palo Alto, and all municipal parking lots and multi-level parking structures are free but limited to two or three hours per weekday 8am–5pm. Downtown Palo Alto has recently added many new lots to fill the overflow of vehicles. Beginning in 2014, Palo Alto has begun implementing permit parking in some areas of the town.

===Air===
Palo Alto is served by Palo Alto Airport (KPAO), one of the busiest single-runway general aviation airports in the country. It is used by many daily commuters who fly (usually in private single-engine aircraft) from their homes in the Central Valley to work in the Palo Alto area.

The nearest commercial airport is San Jose International Airport (SJC) (also known as Norman Mineta Airport), about southeast. Nearby is San Francisco International Airport (SFO), about north.

===Rail===

Passenger train service is provided exclusively by Caltrain, with service between San Francisco and San Jose, extending to Gilroy. Caltrain has two regular stations in Palo Alto, the main one at the Palo Alto Station in downtown Palo Alto (local, limited, and express). The main Palo Alto station is the second busiest (behind 4th and King in San Francisco) on the entire Caltrain line. The other station is located at California Avenue, (local and limited). A third, the Stanford station, located beside Alma Street at Embarcadero Road, is used for occasional sports events (generally football) at Stanford Stadium. Freight trains through Palo Alto are operated by Union Pacific (formerly Southern Pacific).

There are 4 grade crossings within city limits, at the intersections of Alma St, Churchill Ave, Meadow Dr, and Charleston Rd. The city has made plans upgrade the southern crossings and even proposed closing the Churchill Ave crossing completely to road traffic, but the project has been a hot-button issue for local residents and politicians for over a decade. The current proposed solution is elevating the tracks above grade, while lowering the roadway below grade. A subway tunnel underneath the right of way and converting the old track bed into a park was also proposed, but eventually dropped after it was deemed to be too costly and concerns over environmental impacts. Despite increased train service and Caltrain already installing Electric Service equipment on the mainline, Palo Alto has no green-lighted plans to address the crossings, except for immediate changes at Churchill Ave to address safety concerns at that intersection.

===Bus===
The Palo Alto Transit Center adjacent to the Palo Alto Train Station is the major bus hub for northern Santa Clara county. The Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) provides primary bus service through Palo Alto with service to the South Bay and Silicon Valley. San Mateo County Transit District (SamTrans) provides service to San Mateo County to the north but some lines include the Palo Alto Transit Center. The Stanford University Free Shuttle (Marguerite) provides a supplementary bus service between Stanford University and the Palo Alto Transit Center, and the Palo Alto Free Shuttle (Crosstown and Embarcadero), which circulates frequently, and provides service to major points in Palo Alto, including the main library, downtown, the Municipal Golf Course, the Palo Alto Transit Center, and both high schools. The Dumbarton Express is a weekday-only limited stop bus service that connects Union City BART in the East Bay to Palo Alto via the Dumbarton Bridge serving Stanford University, Stanford Research Park, Palo Alto Transit Center, and Veterans Hospital.

===Cycling===

Cycling is a popular mode of transportation in Palo Alto. 9.5% of residents bicycle to work, the highest percentage of any city in the Bay Area, and third highest in the United States, after Davis, California and Boulder, Colorado. Since 2003, Palo Alto has received a Bicycle Friendly Community status of &quot;Gold&quot; from the League of American Bicyclists.

The city&#x27;s flat terrain and many quiet tree-shaded residential streets offer comfort and safety to cyclists, and the temperate climate makes year-round cycling convenient. Palo Alto pioneered the bicycle boulevard concept in the early 1980s, enhancing residential Bryant Street to prioritize it for cyclists by removing stop signs, providing special traffic signals, and installing traffic diverters, and a bicycle/pedestrian bridge over Matadero Creek. However, busy arterial streets which often offer the fastest and most direct route to many destinations, are dangerous for cyclists due to high volumes of fast-moving traffic and the lack of bicycle lanes. El Camino Real, Alma Street, and Embarcadero and Middlefield roads, all identified as &quot;high priorities&quot; for adding bicycle lanes to improve safety by the 2003 Palo Alto Bicycle Transportation Plan, still contain no provisions for cyclists.

The Palo Alto Police Department decided to stop using tasers to detain bicyclists after a 2012 incident in which a 16-year-old boy, who had bicycled through a stop sign, was injured after police officers pursued him, fired a taser at him and suddenly braked their patrol car in front of him, causing the boy to crash.

===Walking===
Conditions for walking are excellent in Palo Alto except for crossing high-volume arterial streets such as El Camino Real and Oregon Expressway. Sidewalks are available on nearly every city street, with the notable exception of the Barron Park neighborhood, which was the last to be incorporated into the city. Palo Alto&#x27;s Street grid is well-connected with few dead-end streets, especially in the city&#x27;s older northern neighborhoods. An extensive urban forest, which is protected by the city&#x27;s municipal code, provides shade and visual diversity, and slows motor vehicle traffic. 4.8% of residents walk to work.

In 1989, Palo Alto received a gift of a large, whimsical wooden sculpture called &quot;Foreign Friends&quot; (&quot;Fjärran Vänner&quot;)—of a man, woman, dog and bird sitting on a park bench—from Linköping. The sculpture was praised by some, called &quot;grotesque&quot; by others, and became a lightning rod for vandals. It was covered with a large, addressed postcard marked &quot;Return to Sender.&quot; A former Stanford University professor was arrested for attempting to light it on fire. It was also doused with paint. When the original heads were decapitated on Halloween, 1993, the statue became a shrine—flowers bouquets and cards were placed upon it. Following an anonymous donation, the heads were restored. Within weeks, the restored heads were decapitated again, this time disappearing. The heads were eventually replaced with new ones, which generated even more distaste, as many deemed the new heads even less attractive.

A few months later, the man&#x27;s arm was chopped off, the woman&#x27;s lap was vandalized, the bird was stolen, and the replacements heads were decapitated and stolen. The sculpture was removed from its location on Embarcadero Road and Waverley Avenue in 1995, dismantled, and placed in storage until it was destroyed in 2000. Ironically, the statue was designed not as a lasting work of art, but as something to be climbed on with a lifespan of 10 to 25 years.
