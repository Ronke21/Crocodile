<text>Chen Shui-bian (; born 12 October 1950) is a Taiwanese former politician and lawyer who served as the 5th president of the Republic of China (Taiwan) from 2000 to 2008. Chen was the first president from the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), ending the Kuomintang&#x27;s (KMT) 55 years of continuous rule in Taiwan. He is sometimes referred to by the nickname A-Bian ().

A lawyer, Chen entered politics in 1980 during the Kaohsiung Incident as a member of the Tangwai movement and was elected to the Taipei City Council in 1981. In 1985, as the editor of the weekly pro-democracy magazine &quot;Neo-Formosa&quot;, he was jailed for libel following publication of an article critical of Elmer Fung, a college philosophy professor who was later elected a New Party legislator. After being released, Chen helped found the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in 1986 and was elected a member of the Legislative Yuan in 1989, and Mayor of Taipei in 1994.

Chen won the 2000 presidential election on 18 March with 39% of the vote as a result of a split of factions within the Kuomintang, when James Soong ran for the presidency as an independent against the party nominee Lien Chan, becoming the first non-member of the Kuomintang to hold the office of president. Although Chen received high approval ratings during the first few weeks of his term, his popularity sharply dropped due to alleged corruption within his administration and the inability to pass legislation against the opposition KMT, who controlled the Legislative Yuan. In 2004, he won reelection by a narrow margin after surviving a shooting while campaigning the day before the election. Opponents suspected him of staging the incident for political purposes. However, the case was officially closed in 2005 with all evidence pointing to a single deceased suspect, Chen Yi-hsiung.

In 2009, Chen and his wife Wu Shu-chen were convicted on two bribery charges. Chen was sentenced to 19 years in Taipei Prison, reduced from a life sentence on appeal, but was granted medical parole on 5 January 2015. Chen&#x27;s supporters have claimed that his trial and sentencing were politically motivated retribution by the Kuomintang for his years in power.

==Early life and education==
Chen was born to an impoverished tenant farming family of Hoklo ethnicity in Kuantien Township of Tainan County (now part of Tainan City) on the second day of the ninth lunar month in 1950 but was not formally issued a birth certificate until 18 February 1951, because of doubts that he would survive.

Chen was educated in Mandarin Chinese, which had replaced Japanese as the national language following the end of the Japanese administration of Taiwan. Academically bright from a young age, he graduated from the prestigious National Tainan First Senior High School with honors. In June 1969, he was admitted to National Taiwan University. Initially a business administration major, he switched to law in his first year and became editor of the school&#x27;s law review. He passed the bar exams before the completion of his junior year with the highest score, becoming Taiwan&#x27;s youngest lawyer. He graduated in 1974 with an LL.B. in commercial law.

In 1975, he married Wu Shu-chen, the daughter of a physician. The couple have a daughter, Chen Hsing-yu, who is a dentist; and a son, Chen Chih-chung, who, having received a law degree in Taiwan, gained a Master of Laws from the University of California, Berkeley in 2005.

From 1976 to 1989, Chen was a partner in Formosa International Marine and Commercial Law, specializing in maritime insurance. He held the firm&#x27;s portfolio for Evergreen Marine Corporation.

==Entry into politics==
Chen became involved in politics in 1980 when he defended the participants of the Kaohsiung Incident in a military court. While his client Huang Hsin-chieh, the leading opposition dissident, and seven co-defendants, including his future Vice President Annette Lu, were found guilty, Chen came to be known for his forceful and colorful arguments. He has stated that it was during this period that he realized the unfairness of the political system in Taiwan and became politically active as a member of the Tangwai movement.

Chen won a seat in the Taipei City Council as a Tangwai candidate in 1981 and served until 1985. In 1984, he founded the pro-opposition Civil Servant Public Policy Research Association, which published a magazine called &quot;Neo-Formosa&quot;. On 12 January 1985, Chen was sentenced to a year in prison for libel as a result of his editorship of &quot;Neo-Formosa,&quot; following the publication of an article which claimed that the doctoral dissertation of Elmer Fung, a college philosophy professor (who would later become a New Party legislator), was plagiarized.

While appealing the sentence, he returned to Tainan to run for county magistrate in November 1985. Three days after losing the election, his wife, Wu Shu-chen was hit twice by a hand tractor driven by Chang Jong-tsai as Chen and Wu were thanking their supporters. She was left paralyzed from the waist down. His supporters believed this was part of a government campaign to intimidate him, although another theory says it was a simple traffic accident.

Chen lost his appeal in May 1986 and began serving eight months in the Tucheng Penitentiary along with Huang Tien-fu and Lee I-yang, two other defendants in the case. Whilst in Tucheng the 3 prisoners were also joined for a period of time by Chi Chia-wei a prominent gay rights activist in Taiwan. While he was in prison, his wife campaigned and was elected to the Legislative Yuan. Upon his release in 1987, Chen served as her chief counsel. In May 2022, the Transitional Justice Commission overturned Chen, Huang and Lee&#x27;s libel charges.

In 1989, Chen was elected to the Legislative Yuan and served as the executive director of the Democratic Progressive Party caucus. With the support of some KMT colleagues, Chen was also elected convener of the National Defense Committee. He was instrumental in laying out and moderating many of the DPP&#x27;s positions on Taiwan independence, including the four ifs. He was reelected to another three-year term in 1992, but resigned in two years to become mayor.

==Taipei mayoralty, 1994–1998==
Chen was elected as the mayor of Taipei in 1994, largely as the result of a vote split between the KMT incumbent Huang Ta-chou and the KMT-spin-off New Party (NP) candidate Jaw Shaw-kong. Unable to find experienced bureaucrats from his own party, Chen and his inner circle of young law school graduates retained many of the KMT administrators and delegated considerable authority.

During his term, Chen received accolades for his campaigns to drive illegal gambling and prostitution rackets out of Taipei. He levied large fines on polluters and reformed public works contracts. Chen renamed many of the roads in Taipei, most notably the road which runs between KMT headquarters to the Presidential Palace from Chieh-shou Road () to Ketagalan Boulevard in an effort to acknowledge the aboriginal people of the Taipei basin. Chen also made highly publicized evictions of longtime KMT squatters on municipal land, and ordered Chiang Wei-kuo&#x27;s estate demolished. Chen was also named one of Asia&#x27;s rising stars, and Taipei became one of the top 50 cities in Asia according to &quot;Time Asia&quot; magazine.

Despite receiving more votes both in absolute and in percentage terms than his 1994 campaign, Chen lost the mayoral election of 1998 to the KMT&#x27;s candidate and future president Ma Ying-jeou in large part because the KMT was able to gain the support of New Party supporters. In his first autobiography, &quot;The Son of Taiwan&quot;, Chen wrote that he was not entirely upset about losing the re-election as it gave him opportunity to find out what areas in his political career he could improve. For example, he wrote that mainland Chinese people generally approved of his social and economic improvements in Taipei, but they ultimately voted for Ma because of ethnic tensions.

He also traveled extensively nationwide and abroad. In South Korea, he met with president Kim Dae-jung, who presented him with an award. He also met with Japanese prime minister Yoshiro Mori, who promised that he would celebrate if he won the 2000 presidential elections. Due to political complications, this promise was not fulfilled until late 2003. 

==Presidency, 2000–2008==

===First term===

In an election similar to Taipei&#x27;s in 1994, Chen won the 2000 presidential election on 18 March 2000, with 39% of the vote as a result of a split of factions within the Kuomintang, when James Soong ran for the presidency as an independent against the party nominee Lien Chan.

Lacking a clear mandate and inheriting a bureaucracy largely loyal to the KMT, Chen tried to reach out to his opposition. He appointed the KMT conservative mainlander Tang Fei, a former general and the incumbent defense minister, as his first premier. Only about half of Chen&#x27;s original cabinet were DPP members, as few DPP politicians had risen above the local level. Although a supporter of Taiwan independence, Chen moderated his stance during his campaign and pledged the Four Noes and One Without in his inaugural address—that as long as the People&#x27;s Republic of China has no intention to use military force against Taiwan, he would not declare independence nor change the national symbols of the Republic of China. He also promised to be, &quot;president of all the people&quot; and resigned his chairmanship from the DPP. His approval rating reached around 70%.

Chen&#x27;s administration ran into many problems, and its policies were constantly blocked by the pan-Blue coalition-controlled legislature. The stock market lost over half its value within a year and unemployment reached 4.5% in part because of the Asian stock market crash. While Chen&#x27;s detractors blamed Chen&#x27;s poor leadership for the economic crisis, the administration blamed the legislature for blocking its relief efforts.

More troublesome for Chen was the political showdown over the construction of the Number Four Nuclear Power Facility. This multibillion-dollar project in Gongliao District was already one-third completed and favored by the pro-business KMT as a means of avoiding an energy shortage. However, the environmentalist DPP strongly objected to the expansion of nuclear power. Premier Tang had threatened to resign if the project were canceled, and Chen accepted his resignation on 3 October 2000, only four and a half months after both had taken office. Chen appointed his political ally Chang Chun-hsiung as Tang&#x27;s replacement. On 27 October, Chang announced that the government would halt construction. But less than an hour earlier, Chen had met with Lien Chan to reconcile differences. Lien had asked Chen to leave the matter for the Legislative Yuan to decide and Chen seemed receptive to the suggestion. When Chang&#x27;s announcement came out, Lien was furious and the KMT began an effort to recall the president. The Council of Grand Justices intervened and declared that it was the legislature and not the cabinet that had the power to decide on the issue. This was widely seen as the end of Chen&#x27;s attempts to face the pan-Blue groups head on. By the end of his first year in office, Chen&#x27;s approval ratings had dropped to 25%.

During the summer of 2001, Chen flew to Los Angeles, Houston, and New York City, where he met with members of the U.S. Congress. The mayor of Houston presented Chen with a key to the city and gave him cowboy clothing. His trip to New York was a first for a head of state from Taiwan as there was unwritten agreement between the US and China that no head of state from Taiwan would be permitted to visit either New York or Washington, D.C.

After his first year in office, Chen moved away from sending conciliatory gestures. In the summer of 2002, Chen again became the chairman of the DPP. During his tenure, images of Chiang Kai-shek and Chiang Ching-kuo disappeared from public buildings. The word &quot;TAIWAN&quot; is now printed on new ROC passports. Also continuing a trend from the previous administration, the Education Ministry revised the school curriculum to be more Taiwan-centered. Government websites have also tended to promote the notion that China is synonymous with the PRC instead of the ROC as was mandated by the KMT. The &quot;Free China Review&quot; was renamed the Taiwan Review and Who&#x27;s Who in the ROC was renamed Who&#x27;s Who in Taiwan. In January 2003, a new Taiwan-Tibet Exchange Foundation was formed but the Cabinet-level Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission was not abolished. Though Chen has proposed talks with the PRC, relations remain deadlocked as Chen refused to pledge to the One-China policy, as required by the PRC for talks to begin. Such a pledge seemed unlikely for Chen since there remained strong opposition within his own party. Despite these symbolic gestures, Chen moved away from &quot;no haste, be patient&quot; policy and opened the three mini links.

====Re-election campaign====
In late 2003, he signed a controversial referendum bill, which he had supported but was heavily watered down by the pan-Blue majority legislature. One concession that the legislature made was to include a provision for an emergency defensive referendum and during the legislative debates it was widely believed that this clause would only be invoked if Taiwan was under imminent threat of attack from China as has been so often threatened. Within a day of the passage of the referendum bill, Chen stated his intention to invoke this provision, citing PRC&#x27;s over 450 missiles aimed directly at the Taiwanese. Pan-Blue believed that his bill was only intended to benefit Chen in the coming election, as whether PRC removes the missiles would not be pressured or decided by referendum result.

In October 2003, Chen flew to New York City for a second time. At the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, he was presented with the Human Rights Award by the International League of Human Rights. In the subsequent leg of the trip to Panama, he met with US Secretary of State Colin Powell and shook hands with him. This high-profile trip raised Chen&#x27;s standing in opinion polls ahead of his opponent Lien Chan for the first time at 35%, according to Agence France-Presse.

His use of the referendum in combination with his talk of a new constitution lead many among his reunification critics to believe that he would attempt to achieve Taiwan independence in his second term by invoking a referendum to create a new constitution that would formally separate Taiwan from any interpretation of China. This caused the government of the United States to follow the lead of Chen&#x27;s political critics and issue a rare rebuke of Chen&#x27;s actions.

Chen was shot in the stomach while campaigning in the city of Tainan on Friday, 19 March 2004, the day before polls opened on Saturday. His vice-president Annette Lu was also reportedly shot in the leg in the same incident. The following day, Chen narrowly won the election with a margin of less than 30,000 votes out of 12.9 million votes counted. Both of his referendum proposals were rejected due to insufficient turnout, in part by the pan-Blue boycott. Those that did vote for the referendum overwhelmingly favored it. Pan-Blue candidate Lien Chan refused to concede and sued both for a recount and for a nullification of the outcome while supporters held a week-long protest led by the pan-Blues front of the presidential office in Taipei. He also claimed that the shooting was staged by Chen to win sympathy votes.

Throughout the election, Chen planned to hold a referendum in 2006 on a new constitution to be enacted upon the accession of the 12th-term president in May 2008. After the election, he sought to reassure critics and moderate supporters that the new constitution would not address the issue of sovereignty, and that the current constitution was in need of comprehensive reform after more than a decade of patchwork revision.

===Second term===
On 20 May 2004, Chen was sworn in for his second term as president amid continued mass protests by the pan-blue alliance over the validity of his re-election. Having heard protests from pro-independence figures in Taiwan, he did not explicitly re-state the Four Noes and One Without but did state that he reaffirmed the commitments made in his first inaugural. He defended his proposals to change the constitution, but asked for constitutional reform to be undertaken through existing procedures instead of calling for a referendum for an entirely new constitution which was proposed by former president Lee Teng-hui. This would require approval by a three-fourths majority of the National Assembly which could authorize a referendum. This has two major implications. First, by going through existing constitutional amendment procedures, this has the symbolic effect of maintaining continuity with the existing constitution which was originally written in China. Second, this has the practical effect of requiring the Chen administration to get the consent of the opposition pan-Blue coalition to pass any amendments, and while the opposition is willing to consider constitutional reforms that would increase governmental efficiency, they are unlikely to support anything that would imply a &quot;de jure&quot; declaration of independence.

However, even these seemingly conciliatory gestures did not quell unease by his critics at his election. Some have pointed out that he qualified his statements on the constitution with the statement that this is a personal suggestion. Furthermore, it is widely believed in Taiwan that some of these gestures were essentially forced on him again by pressure from the United States and the PRC. The PRC has stated many times that it cares little about what Chen says, but will watch closely in the next few months to see what he does, a standard sentence that Communist China continues to quote.

Three days before Chen&#x27;s inauguration, the Taiwan Affairs Office of the PRC issued what has become known as the May 17 Declaration. In that declaration, China accused Chen of continuing with a creep toward independence, having merely paid lip service to his commitments in his first term of office, and reiterated that there would be consequences if Chen did not halt policies toward Taiwan independence, but at the same time offered major concessions if Chen would accept the One China Principle.

In late 2004, in effort to maintain the balance of power in the region, Chen began eagerly pushing for a US$18 billion arms purchase from the United States, but the Pan-Blue Coalition repeatedly blocked the deal in the legislature. Criticism has been made of this, citing contradictory arguments used, such as that the weapons were not what Taiwan needed, or that the weapons were a good idea but too expensive. By late 2006, the KMT had signalled it would support some of the arms sale being approved, but failed to pass a revised arms bill by the end of the legislative session in early 2007, despite promises by then KMT chairman, Ma Ying-jeou, to do that.

Chen announced on 5 December that state-owned or private enterprises and foreign offices bearing the name &quot;China&quot;, such as China Airlines, the China Steel Corporation, and Chinese Petroleum Corporation, would be renamed to bear the name &quot;Taiwan.&quot; On 14 December 2004, following the failure of the Pan-Green coalition to gain a majority of seats in the 2004 ROC legislative election (as many had expected to occur), Chen resigned as chairman of the DPP. This dashed hopes that the stalemate that plagued Chen&#x27;s first term would end.

In 2005 Chen became the first ROC president to visit Europe, when he attended the funeral of Pope John Paul II in the Vatican City (the Holy See continues to maintain diplomatic relations with the ROC). In order to shore up diplomatic support, it is common for the ROC president to visit the ROC&#x27;s remaining diplomatic allies; however, past presidents had been prevented from visiting the Vatican because such a visit would require passage through Italy, which maintains relations with the PRC. Under agreement with the Vatican, Italy permitted all guests to the funeral passage without hindrance and Chen was received at the airport in his capacity as a foreign head of state. In this religious ceremony where U.S. president George W. Bush greeted Iranian president Khatami, Chen did not seem to attempt to a high profile of himself by reaching out to other heads of states such as Bush or British prime minister Tony Blair. Chen was named one of the &quot;Time&quot; 100 for 2005.

Later in the year, Chen traveled to Miami in stopover for a forum in the Caribbean. He met with members of the U.S. Congress through video conference and was invited to visit Washington, D.C. On his way back, he was originally scheduled to fly through San Francisco. However, he changed course and stopped-over at the United Arab Emirates. The head of state greeted him and hosted a formal state dinner, infuriating the Chinese officials. Chen made his way back after making a stopover at Jakarta. His request for a pitstop at Singapore was denied; authorities cited weather problems.

On 28 February 2006, Chen announced that the National Unification Council, which was set up in 1990 to create guidelines for unification with China if it adopted democracy, would &quot;cease to function&quot;. He took care to use this phrase rather than &quot;abolish&quot; because he had promised during his 2000 campaign that he would not abolish the council or its guidelines. Adam Ereli, deputy spokesman of the US State Department, issued a statement on 2 March 2006, that the understanding of the United States was that the difference between &quot;abolish&quot; and &quot;ceasing activity&quot; implied no change in the status quo.

On 3 May 2006, Chen canceled plans to pass through the United States on his way to Latin America. He was hoping to stop by either San Francisco or New York City to refuel and stay overnight, but the US refused his request instead limiting him to a brief refuelling stopover in Anchorage, Alaska, where Chen would not be allowed to step off the plane. Chen and Taiwan saw this as a snub and led to Chen&#x27;s cancellation. The trip to Latin America continued, however, without a US stopover. The US State Department claimed that the Alaska stopover offer was consistent with its previous accommodations. However, former Taiwan president Lee Teng-hui was granted a visit to Cornell University eleven years earlier. More recently, in addition, Taiwan&#x27;s leaders have in general been granted permission to stopover in the United States for brief periods before continuing on to other countries. This recent American stance is interpreted by Taiwan to be an expression of the increasing irritation the United States feels towards Taiwan and Chen&#x27;s seemingly pro-independence gestures. Chen attended the inauguration of Óscar Arias, the president of Costa Rica, one of the few countries that recognized the Republic of China at that time. Laura Bush was also present to represent U.S. president George W. Bush. Chen seized the opportunity, approached her and shook her hands, while Chen&#x27;s aide produced a camera immediately for an impromptu photo-op. Chen&#x27;s supporters saw this act as a step forward in Taiwan&#x27;s struggle for diplomatic recognition, while his detractors claimed that it was a grave breach of international etiquette and put Taiwan to shame.

On 12 May 2007, Premier Su Tseng-Chang resigned his position, and Chen soon appointed Chang Chun-hsiung to fill the vacant premiership. During Chen&#x27;s tenure, beginning in 2000, the country has seen six different premiers in the past seven years. During the same period of time, from 2000 onward, the Democratic Progressive Party has also seen seven different chairmen.

Chen&#x27;s tenure as president expired on 20 May 2008, yielding to successor Ma Ying-Jeou. From his election to his first term to his last days as president, Chen&#x27;s approval ratings fell from 79% to just 21%.

==Corruption scandals==
In May 2006, his approval rating fell to around 20% after a series of scandals centered on his wife and son-in-law. Support from his own party had also dropped with a few prominent members, such as Shih Ming-teh, calling for his resignation in the Million Voices Against Corruption, President Chen Must Go campaign. On 24 May 2006, his son-in-law, Chao Chien-ming, was taken into custody by the Taipei police on charges of insider trading and embezzlement by the opposition party. This was a setback for the Chen Shui-bian administration. In related charges, there were accusations from the opposition party that Chen Shui-bian&#x27;s wife was involved in trading stocks and obtaining Pacific Sogo Department Store&#x27;s gift certificates illegally in exchange for settling the disputed ownership.

On 1 June 2006, Chen declared that he was handing control of governmental matters to Premier of the Republic of China, Su Tseng-chang, and announced he would not be involved in campaigning. He also stated that he was retaining authority on matters that the constitution required him to retain authority over, presumably foreign affairs and defense policy, as well as relations with the PRC.

On 20 July 2006, opposition politicians accused that Chen had used a total of NT$10.2 million (US$310,000) worth of &quot;fake invoices&quot; to claim expenses after the National Audit Office found irregularities in presidential office accounts. The Taiwan High Court Prosecutors&#x27; Office investigated over this accusation. In a press release, the presidential office responded that the president assured the investigators that he did not pocket a single cent of the fund. During questioning at the presidential Office on the afternoon of 7 August 2006, the president detailed to the prosecutor how he spent the fund and presented relevant receipts and bank remittance statements.

Chen also lost a libel case brought on successfully by PFP chairman James Soong. Soong sued the president after Chen repeatedly accused him of secretly meeting the director of the People&#x27;s Republic of China&#x27;s Taiwan Affairs Office. Soong successfully sued Chen for NT$3 million.

On 3 November 2006, Chen&#x27;s wife Wu Shu-chen and three other high-ranking officials of the Presidential Office were indicted of corruption of NT$14.8 million (US$450,000) of government funds using faked documents. Due to the protection from the constitution against prosecution of the sitting president, Chen could not be prosecuted until he left office, and he was not indicted, but was alleged to be an accomplice on his wife&#x27;s indictment. The prosecutor of the case indicated that once Chen left office, his office would start the procedures to press charges against Chen. The indictment filed by prosecutors states that the indicted persons obtained government funds earmarked for secret foreign affairs, yet of six supposed secret diplomatic missions, there was sufficient evidence presented for only two. Of the remaining four, it was concluded that one did not exist, and in the case of the other three, the invoices presented were not found to be related to the secret missions.

The pan-Blue coalition, after receiving the news, demanded to call for another recall motion unless Chen resigned immediately. Another small party that backed Chen previously, Taiwan Solidarity Union, said they would likely to support the upcoming recall measure. If the recall had passed, it would have been up to the voters to decide Chen&#x27;s fate in a referendum.

Leaders of the Democratic Progressive Party met together to discuss the unfavorable charges. The meeting ended when party leaders demanded Chen to explain the accusation within three days. There had long been rumblings inside the DPP that Chen has become their liability and should recall him before the presidential election. If Chen had resigned, he would have been the first Taiwanese president to step down and the vice-president, Annette Lu, would likely have taken power.

After the prosecutor announced the indictment, the campaign leader Shih proclaimed that the indictment was the historical high point in Taiwan and the month-long campaign was a success.

In a press conference 5 November 2006, Chen rebutted the charges against his wife and members of his presidential office. He said that Taiwan government offices advised him to prepare the receipts in such a fashion, and that after six years of doing so, it is strange that they would never mention an irregularity if it was not the right way to do it. He promised that all of the money actually went to diplomatic missions and did not go into any private pockets. Furthermore, he mentioned that when he took office, he thought his salary was so excessive that he cut his own salary in half, and that reduction is more than the amount he is accused of embezzling, so there is no need for him to take that money. In addition, he said that if the charges against his wife were proven in a court of law just as they were charged, then he would at that time step down as President of the Republic of China.

In defense of Chen, journalist Therese Shaheen of &quot;The Wall Street Journal Asia&quot; pointed out that controversy surrounding Chen can be in part attributed to the radical reforms he has tried to implement since stepping into power.

===Recall motion===

In mid-June 2007, opposition pan-blue camp lawmakers initiated a recall motion that would allow the voters to remove Chen from power via a public referendum. On 20 June, Chen addressed the nation by television, denying any involvement of the first family or himself (other than his son-in-law) in any of the alleged scandals, or &quot;directly&quot; accepting the department&#x27;s gift certificates. The motion was not passed. Of 221 lawmakers in the legislature, all 119 pan-blue and independent legislators voted in favor of the measure, 29 votes short of the two-thirds majority needed to pass the motion. Pan-Green legislators from the president&#x27;s own party, the DPP, refused to receive ballots. Pan-Green legislators from the allied TSU cast abstaining ballots. No legislator voted against the recall motion.

After Wu was indicted, the Pan-Blue parties renewed calls to recall Chen, and TSU at first indicated that it would support the recall this time, but then said it would only support the new recall motion if &quot;concrete evidence concerning corruption is presented&quot;.
On 1 September 2006, political activist Shih Ming-te launched an anti-corruption campaign. The movement accused Chen of corruption and asked for his resignation. By 7 September, more than one million signatures were collected, each with a donation of NT$100 (approximately US$3.00). On 9 September, tens of thousands of people demonstrated in the streets of Taiwan, wearing red. According to organisers, around 200,000 to 300,000 people joined the protest outside the presidential offices, but the police used aerial photography crowd counting techniques to put the number at about 90,000. Shih Ming-teh confirmed that most of his supporters are from the pan-Blue coalition in a September interview in &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

===2008 elections===
In the legislative election in 2008, Chen&#x27;s party suffered a clear defeat, and Chen subsequently resigned as party chairman. With Chen&#x27;s resignation and Frank Hsieh&#x27;s ascension as the party&#x27;s new chairman, the DPP has changed chairmen seven times since Chen took office in 2000.

In the presidential election on 22 March 2008, Kuomintang candidate Ma Ying-jeou defeated DPP candidate Frank Hsieh.

==Post-presidency==
Chen stepped down on 20 May 2008, the same day that Ma Ying-jeou took office as the new president of the Republic of China. No longer bearing the title of president, Chen left the Presidential Office Building, and his presidential immunity was removed. He was placed under restrictions, such as confinement to Taiwan, by prosecutors as a result of allegations of corruption and abuse of authority, both of which he was later charged guilty of. One fraud case involved the handling of a special presidential fund used to pursue Taiwan&#x27;s foreign diplomacy.

President Ma Ying-jeou declassified government documents which aided the investigation into Chen&#x27;s usage of special government funds. Chen&#x27;s lawyers responded by suing Ma, on 6 August 2008, alleging Ma&#x27;s declassification of the documents that were initially classified by Chen to be &quot;politically motivated&quot;. The documents consisted mainly of receipts and other records of special expenses, which according to Ma&#x27;s chief aide assured pose no danger to the country&#x27;s interests once declassified.

After two years of investigation, it was found that Chen Shui-bian received millions from the owners of the TCC Company after the government bought the Longtan land, which was then integrated into the Science Park project. There were several other instances of corruption, which became the subject of a graft trial that also included the former president&#x27;s wife and 11 other co-defendants. The trial revealed that Chen and his wife amassed a total of NT$800 million and some were laundered overseas. The former president was found guilty by the Taipei District Courts of violating Punishment of Corruption Act (貪污治罪條例), Money Laundering Control Act (洗錢防制法), and Criminal Code (刑法).

On 11 September 2009, Chen received a life sentence and was fined NT$200 million (US$6.13 million) for embezzlement, bribery and money laundering involving a total of US$15 million (NT$490 million) in funds while in office from 2000 to 2008. Supporters of Chen contended that the prosecution was politically motivated. Chen is the first ROC president to receive a prison sentence.

On 8 June 2010, the Taipei District Court found Chen not guilty of embezzling diplomatic funds. On 11 June 2010, the High Court decided to reduce Chen&#x27;s life sentence to 20 years. Through several court cases and pleads for bail, the High Court rejected his request for bail and continued to detain him in jail for another 5 months. The detention led Chen&#x27;s supporters to protest that the detention of Chen for more than 600 days without proving him guilty was illegal, inhumane and unjust, and a result of political revenge by the part of the Kuomintang (KMT). The Yellow Ribbon Movement took to demonstration over alleged exploitation of justice and political revenge.

Meanwhile, on 17 August 2010, both the Taipei District Court and the High Court found ex-deputy military minister, Ke Cheng-Hen (), not guilty of revealing non-military secrets to former president Chen Shui-Bian.

The parliament with a KMT and pan-Blue coalition majority passed an amendment to the &quot;preferential treatment for retired presidents and vice presidents act&quot; () on 19 August 2010. Introduced by the KMT, the amendment stipulated that former presidents and vice presidents will be stripped of courtesy treatment, including their monthly allowance and annual expenses, if convicted by a court of grave offense(s), such as sedition and graft. The number of bodyguards assigned to former presidents and vice presidents who are convicted of corruption in a first trial will also be reduced. Former president Chen&#x27;s son stated the act was created to target the now imprisoned former president.

In 2016, the United States Department of Justice stated it will return &quot;approximately $1.5 million to Taiwan, the proceeds of the sale of a forfeited New York condominium and a Virginia residence that the United States alleged in its complaint were purchased with the proceeds of bribes.&quot;

===Health and medical parole===
In September 2012, Chen was admitted to Taoyuan General Hospital after complaints of having difficulty urinating, where it was concluded that he had suffered from a minor stroke. He was subsequently transferred to the Taipei Veterans General Hospital for further testing, where he was diagnosed with sleep apnea, severe depression and other cognitive disorders. His symptoms included stuttering and memory loss.

He attempted suicide on Sunday, 2 June 2013. In January 2015, Chen was released from prison on medical parole due to his ailing (but undiagnosed) condition.

His time spent under medical parole does not count toward his prison sentence. Part of the terms of his medical parole stipulate that he cannot participate in public political discussions. In January 2021, he started a radio show of non-political nature. Some people called this issue out because Chen Shui-bian appeared to be in perfect health.

Chen currently serves as the host of a radio program.

==Position on Taiwan&#x27;s political status==

In 1999, the Democratic Progressive Party amended its charter to regard Taiwan as already independent as the ROC, and therefore it was unnecessary to declare independence. In his 2000 inauguration speech, Chen struck a more moderate tone and pledged to the Four Noes and One Without: that as long as the PRC did not intend to use military force against Taiwan, he would not declare independence, change the name of the country to &quot;Republic of Taiwan&quot;, push for the inclusion of &quot;special state-to-state relations&quot; in the Constitution, or promote a referendum on independence. In addition, he pledged not to abolish the National Unification Council. However, in August 2002, frustrated by a lack of reciprocation from the PRC, he described the relationship as &quot;one country on each side&quot; and initiated a referendum on cross-strait relations in 2004, returning to a more confrontational stance.

In a 2007 interview with the New York Times, Chen reiterated the DPP stance that Taiwan was already independent.

Post-presidency, Chen has expressed his wishes to one day visit the village in Fujian which his ancestors migrated from in the 18th century. In 2018, Chen, along with Lee Teng-hui, expressed support for a Formosa Alliance plan to amend the referendum act to allow for a 2019 referendum on &quot;de jure&quot; independence, though neither goal was realized by the planned date.

<text>Lee Teng-hui (; pinyin: &quot;Lǐ Dēnghuī&quot;; 15 January 192330 July 2020) was a Taiwanese politician and agricultural scientist who served as the 4th president of the Republic of China (Taiwan) under the 1947 Constitution and chairman of the Kuomintang (KMT) from 1988 to 2000. He was the first president to be born in Taiwan, the last to be indirectly elected and the first to be directly elected. 

Before entering politics, Lee was an agricultural scientist who earned a master&#x27;s degree from Iowa State University and a PhD from Cornell University in the United States. During his presidency, Lee oversaw the end of martial law and the full democratization of the ROC, advocated the Taiwanese localization movement, and led an ambitious foreign policy agenda to gain allies around the world. Lee was credited as the president who completed Taiwan&#x27;s democratic transition.

After leaving office, he remained active in Taiwanese politics. Lee was considered the &quot;spiritual leader&quot; of the pro-independence Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), and recruited for the party in the past. After Lee campaigned for TSU candidates in the 2001 Taiwanese legislative election, he was expelled by the KMT. Other activities that Lee engaged in included maintaining relations with former Taiwanese president Chen Shui-bian and Japan.

== Early life and education ==

Lee was born in the rural farming community of Sanshi Village, Taihoku Prefecture, Japanese Taiwan. He was of Yongding, Tingzhou Hakka descent. As a child, he often dreamed of traveling abroad, and became an avid stamp collector. Growing up under Japanese colonial rule, he developed a strong interest in Japan. He was given his Japanese name, Iwasato Masao (岩里政男) by his father. Lee&#x27;s father was a middle-level Japanese police aide, and his elder brother, Lee Teng-chin (李登欽), who was also known as in Japanese, joined the colony&#x27;s police academy and soon volunteered for the Imperial Japanese Navy and died in Manila. Lee—one of only four Taiwanese students in his class at , the only higher school (preparatory schools for the Imperial Universities) in Japanese Taiwan—graduated with honors and was given a scholarship to Japan&#x27;s Kyoto Imperial University.

During his school days, he learned kendo and bushido. A lifelong collector of books, Lee was heavily influenced by Japanese thinkers like Nitobe Inazō and Kitaro Nishida in Kyoto. In 1944, he too volunteered for service in the Imperial Japanese Army and became a second lieutenant, in command of an anti-aircraft gun in Taiwan. He was ordered back to Japan in 1945 and participated in the clean-up after the Great Tokyo Air Raid of March 1945. Lee stayed in Japan after the surrender and graduated from Kyoto Imperial University in 1946.

After World War II ended, and the Republic of China took over Taiwan, Lee enrolled in the National Taiwan University, where in 1948 he earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in agricultural science. Lee joined the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) for two stints, in September 1946 and October or November 1947, both times briefly. Lee began the with four others. This group was absorbed by the CCP, and Lee officially left the party in September 1948. In a 2002 interview, Lee admitted that he had been a Communist; Lee remains the only Taiwanese president known to have once been a member of the Chinese Communist Party. In that same interview, Lee said that he had strongly opposed Communism for a long time because he understood the theory well and knew that it was doomed to fail. Lee stated that he joined the Communists out of hatred for the KMT.

In 1953, Lee received a master&#x27;s degree in agricultural economics from Iowa State University (ISU) in the United States. Lee returned to Taiwan in 1957 as an economist with the Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction (JCRR), an organization sponsored by the U.S. which aimed at modernizing Taiwan&#x27;s agricultural system and at land reform. During this period, he also worked as an adjunct professor in the Department of Economics at National Taiwan University and taught at the Graduate School of East Asian Studies at National Chengchi University.

In the mid-1960s, Lee returned to the United States, and earned a Ph.D. in agricultural economics from Cornell University in 1968. His advisor was John Williams Mellor. His doctoral dissertation, &quot;Intersectoral Capital Flows in the Economic Development of Taiwan, 1895–1960&quot; (published as a book under the same name) was honored as the year&#x27;s best doctoral thesis by the American Association of Agricultural Economics and remains an influential work on Taiwan&#x27;s economy during the Japanese and early KMT periods.

Lee encountered Christianity as a young man and in 1961 was baptised. For most of the rest of his political career, despite holding high office, Lee made a habit of giving sermons at churches around Taiwan, mostly on apolitical themes of service and humility. He was a member of the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan.

Lee&#x27;s native language was Taiwanese Hokkien. He was proficient in both Mandarin and Japanese and was able to speak English well. It has been claimed that he was more proficient in Japanese than Mandarin.

== Rise to power ==
Shortly after returning to Taiwan, Lee joined the KMT in 1971 and was made a cabinet minister without portfolio responsible for agriculture.

In 1978, Lee was appointed mayor of Taipei, where he solved water shortages and improved the city&#x27;s irrigation problems. In 1981, he became governor of Taiwan Province and made further irrigation improvements.

As a skilled technocrat, Lee soon caught the eye of President Chiang Ching-kuo as a strong candidate to serve as vice president. Chiang sought to move more authority to the &quot;bensheng ren&quot; (residents of Taiwan before 1949 and their descendants) instead of continuing to promote &quot;waisheng ren&quot; (Chinese immigrants who arrived in Taiwan after 1949 and their descendants) as his father had. President Chiang nominated Lee to become his Vice President. Lee was formally elected by the National Assembly in 1984.

== Presidency ==

Chiang Ching-kuo died in January 1988 and Lee succeeded him as president. The &quot;Palace Faction&quot; of the KMT, a group of conservative Chinese headed by General Hau Pei-tsun, Premier Yu Kuo-hwa, and Education Minister Lee Huan, as well as Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s widow, Soong Mei-ling, were deeply distrustful of Lee and sought to block his accession to the KMT chairmanship and sideline him as a figurehead. With the help of James Soong—himself a member of the Palace Faction—who quieted the hardliners with the famous plea &quot;Each day of delay is a day of disrespect to Ching-kuo,&quot; Lee was allowed to ascend to the chairmanship unobstructed. At the 13th National Congress of Kuomintang in July 1988, Lee named 31 members of the Central Committee, 16 of whom were &quot;bensheng ren&quot;: for the first time, &quot;bensheng ren&quot; held a majority in what was then a powerful policy-making body. On 20 March, he ordered to release the political prisoner, Gen. Sun Li-jen from 33 years of house arrest. In August, he listened to the aboriginal legislator Tsai Chung-han&#x27;s advocacy in the General Assembly of Legislative Yuan and the journalism reportage of Independence Evening Post on the human rights&#x27; concern to release the remaining survivors of the civilian Tanker Tuapse free after 34 years in captivity.

As he consolidated power during the early years of his presidency, Lee allowed his rivals within the KMT to occupy positions of influence: when Yu Guo-hwa retired as premier in 1989, he was replaced by Lee Huan, who was succeeded by Hau Pei-tsun in 1990. At the same time, Lee made a major reshuffle of the Executive Yuan, as he had done with the KMT Central Committee, replacing several elderly &quot;waishengren&quot; with younger &quot;benshengren&quot;, mostly of technical backgrounds. Fourteen of these new appointees, like Lee, had been educated in the United States. Prominent among the appointments were Lien Chan as foreign minister and Shirley Kuo as finance minister.

1990 saw the arrival of the Wild Lily student movement on behalf of full democracy for Taiwan. Thousands of Taiwanese students demonstrated for democratic reforms. The demonstrations culminated in a sit-in demonstration by over 300,000 students at Memorial Square in Taipei. Students called for direct elections of the national president and vice president and for a new election for all legislative seats. On 21 March, Lee welcomed some of the students to the Presidential Building. He expressed his support of their goals and pledged his commitment to full democracy in Taiwan.

In May 1991, Lee spearheaded a drive to eliminate the Temporary Provisions Effective During the Period of Communist Rebellion, laws put in place following the KMT arrival in 1949 that suspended the democratic functions of the government. In December 1991, the original members of the Legislative Yuan, elected to represent Chinese constituencies in 1948, were forced to resign and new elections were held to apportion more seats to the &quot;bensheng ren&quot;. The elections forced Hau Pei-tsun from the premiership, a position he was given in exchange for his tacit support of Lee. He was replaced by Lien Chan, then an ally of Lee.

The prospect of the first island-wide democratic election the next year, together with Lee&#x27;s June 1995 visit to Cornell University, sparked the Third Taiwan Strait Crisis. The United States had not prepared the PRC for Lee receiving a United States visa. While in the United States, Lee stated, &quot;Taiwan is a country with independent sovereignty.

The PRC conducted a series of missile tests in the waters surrounding Taiwan and other military maneuvers off the coast of Fujian in response to what Communist Party leaders described as moves by Lee to &quot;split the motherland&quot;. The PRC government launched another set of tests just days before the election, sending missiles over the island to express its dissatisfaction should the Taiwanese people vote for Lee. In 1996, the United States sent two aircraft carrier groups to Taiwan&#x27;s vicinity and the PRC then de-escalated. The military actions disrupted trade and shipping lines and caused a temporary dip in the Asian stock market.

Lee&#x27;s overall stance on Taiwanese independence during the election cycle was characterized as &quot;deliberately vague&quot;.

The previous eight presidents and vice presidents of the ROC had been elected by the members of the National Assembly. For the first time, the President of the ROC would be elected by majority vote of Taiwan&#x27;s population. On 23 March 1996, Lee became the first popularly elected ROC president with 54% of the vote. Many people who worked or resided in other countries made special trips back to the island to vote. In addition to the president, the governor of Taiwan Province and the mayors of Taipei and Kaohsiung (as leaders of provincial level divisions they were formerly appointed by the president) became popularly elected.

Lee, in an interview that same year, expressed his view that a special state-to-state relationship existed between Taiwan and the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) that all negotiations between the two sides of the Strait needed to observe. As president, he attempted to further reform the government. Controversially, he attempted to remove the provincial level of government and proposed that lower level government officials be appointed, not elected.

Lee, observing constitutional term limits he had helped enact, stepped down from the presidency at the end of his term in 2000. That year, Democratic Progressive Party candidate Chen Shui-bian won the national election with 39% of the vote in a three-way race. Chen&#x27;s victory marked an end to KMT rule and the first peaceful transfer of power in Taiwan&#x27;s new democratic system.

Supporters of rival candidates Lien Chan and James Soong accused Lee of setting up the split in the KMT that had enabled Chen to win. Lee had promoted the uncharismatic Lien over the popular Soong as the KMT candidate. Soong had subsequently run as an independent and was expelled from the KMT. The number of votes garnered by both Soong and Lien would have accounted for approximately 60% of the vote while individually the candidates placed behind Chen. Protests were staged in front of the KMT party headquarters in Taipei. Fuelling this anger were the persistent suspicions following Lee throughout his presidency that he secretly supported Taiwan independence and that he was intentionally sabotaging the Kuomintang from above. Lee resigned his chairmanship on 24 March.

During his presidency, Lee supported the Taiwanese localization movement. The Taiwanization movement has its roots in Japanese rule founded during the Japanese era and sought to put emphasis on vernacular Taiwanese culture in Taiwan as the center of people&#x27;s lives as opposed to Nationalist China. During the Chiang era, China was promoted as the center of an ideology that would build a Chinese national outlook in a people who had once considered themselves Japanese subjects. Taiwan was often relegated to a backwater province of China in the KMT-supported history books. People were discouraged from studying local Taiwanese customs, which were to be replaced by mainstream Chinese customs. Lee sought to turn Taiwan into a center rather than an appendage. In 1997, he presided over the adoption of the Taiwan-centric history textbook &quot;Knowing Taiwan&quot;.

== South China Sea dispute ==
Under Lee, it was stated that &quot;legally, historically, geographically, or in reality&quot;, all of the South China Sea and Spratly islands were the territory of the Republic of China and under ROC sovereignty, and denounced actions undertaken there by Malaysia and the Philippines, in a statement on 13 July 1999 released by the foreign ministry of Taiwan. The claims made by both the PRC and the Republic of China &quot;mirror&quot; each other. During international talks involving the Spratly islands, the PRC and ROC have sometimes made efforts to coordinate their positions with each other since both have the same claims.

== Post-presidency ==

Since resigning the chairmanship of the KMT, Lee stated a number of political positions and ideas which he did not mention while he was president, but which he appeared to have privately maintained. After Lee endorsed the candidates of the newly formed Pan-Green Taiwan Solidarity Union, a party established by a number of his KMT allies, Lee was expelled from the KMT on 21 September 2001.

Lee publicly supported the Name Rectification Campaigns in Taiwan and proposed changing the name of the country from the Republic of China to the Republic of Taiwan. He generally opposed unlimited economic ties with the PRC, placing restrictions on Taiwanese wishing to invest in China.

After Chen Shui-bian succeeded Lee in the 2000 election, the two enjoyed a close relationship despite being from different political parties. Chen regularly asked Lee for advice during his first term in office. In Chen&#x27;s 2001 book, he called Lee the &quot;Father of Taiwanese Democracy&quot; and also named himself the &quot;Son of Taiwan&quot; with respect to Lee. However, the two&#x27;s relationship began to worsen when Lee questioned Chen&#x27;s reform of the fisheries branch of the Council of Agriculture. Though Lee was present in the 228 Hand-in-Hand rally orchestrated by the Pan-Green Coalition before the 2004 election, the two&#x27;s relationship broke apart after Chen asked James Soong to be the President of the Executive Yuan in 2005, which Lee disagreed with. Lee also publicly criticized Chen in 2006 by calling him incapable and corrupt.

In February 2007, Lee shocked the media when he revealed that he did not support Taiwanese independence, when he was widely seen as the spiritual leader of the pro-independence movement. Lee also said that he supported opening up trade and tourism with China, a position he had opposed before. Lee later explained that Taiwan already enjoys &quot;de facto&quot; independence and that political maneuvering over details of expressing it is counterproductive. He maintains that &quot;Taiwan should seek &#x27;normalization&#x27; by changing its name and amending its constitution.&quot;

=== Relations with Japan ===
Lee enjoyed a warm relationship with the people and culture of Japan. During the latter period of Japanese rule of Taiwan from 1895 to 1945, Lee attended a Japanese school where he was one of only four Taiwanese in a class of 23 pupils. At the time, due to the Kominka movement, Taiwanese Han culture and language was greatly discouraged. Lee&#x27;s father was a middle-level Japanese police aide; his elder brother died serving in the Imperial Japanese Navy in World War II and is listed in the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo. During his youth, Lee had a Japanese name, . This name was suggested by Lee Teng-chin, combining Longyan (), where their family originated, and their surname Lee (), which shares the same pronunciation with the character &quot;&quot; in both Japanese &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot; and Chinese. Lee spoke fondly of his upbringing and his teachers and was welcomed in visits to Japan since leaving office. Lee admired and enjoyed all things Japanese such as traditional Japanese values. This was the target of criticism from the Pan-Blue Coalition in Taiwan, as well as from China, due to the anti-Japanese sentiment formed during and after World War II. However, this animosity fell in later years, especially in Taiwan.

In 1989, he received the highest distinction of the Scout Association of Japan, the Golden Pheasant Award.

In August 2001, Lee said of Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi&#x27;s controversial visit to Yasukuni Shrine, &quot;It is natural for a premier of a country to commemorate the souls of people who lost their lives for their country.&quot; In a May 2007 trip to Japan, Lee visited the shrine himself to pay tribute to his elder brother. Controversy rose because the shrine also enshrines World War II Class A criminals among the other soldiers.

During the 2012 China anti-Japanese demonstrations, on 13 September 2012, Lee remarked, &quot;The Senkaku Islands, no matter whether in the past, for now or in the future, certainly belong to Japan.&quot; Ten years previously, he had stated, &quot;The Senkaku Islands are the territory of Japan.&quot; In September 2014, Lee expressed support for a Japanese equivalent to the United States&#x27; Taiwan Relations Act, which was discussed in the Japanese Diet in February, though the idea was first proposed by Chen Shui-bian in 2006.

In 2014, Lee said in the Japanese magazine &quot;SAPIO&quot; published by Shogakukan, &quot;China spreads lies such as Nanjing Massacre to the world ... Korea and China use invented history as their activity of propaganda for their country. Comfort women is the most remarkable example.&quot; In 2015, Lee said &quot;The issue of Taiwanese comfort women is already solved&quot; in the Japanese magazine &quot;Voice&quot; (published by PHP Institute). He was strongly criticized by Chen I-hsin, spokesman of the Presidential Office as &quot;not ignorant but cold-blooded&quot;. Chen added, &quot;If Lee Teng-hui really thinks the issue of comfort women is solved, go to a theater and see &quot;Song of the Reed&quot;.&quot;

In July 2015, Lee visited Japan, and again stated that Japan has full sovereignty over the Senkaku Islands. This was the first time Lee made remarks of this nature while in Japan. Members of the pan-Blue New Party and Kuomintang accused him of treason. New Party leader Yok Mu-ming filed charges of treason against Lee, while the KMT&#x27;s Lai Shyh-bao called a caucus meeting to seek revisions to the Act Governing Preferential Treatment for Retired Presidents and Vice Presidents, aimed at denying Lee privileges as a former president.

Lee also stated, in 2015, that Taiwanese people were &quot;subjects of Japan&quot; and that Taiwan and Japan were &quot;one country&quot;, sparking much criticism from both China and the Pan-Blue Coalition. In response to media requests for comment, then presidential candidate Tsai Ing-wen said that “each generation and ethnic group in Taiwan has lived a different history,” and that people should approach these differing experiences and interpretations with an attitude of understanding that will allow for learning from history, rather than allowing it to be used a tool for manipulating divisions.

Lee published a book, &quot;Remaining Life: My Life Journey and the Road of Taiwan&#x27;s Democracy&quot;, in February 2016. In it, he reasserted support for Japanese sovereignty claims over the Senkaku Islands, drawing complaints from the ROC Presidential Office, President-elect Tsai Ing-wen, and Yilan County fishermen.

On 22 June 2018, he visited Japan for the final time in his life.

=== Controversies and indictment ===
On 30 June 2011, Lee, along with former KMT financier Liu Tai-ying were indicted on graft and money-laundering charges and accused of embezzling US$7.79 million in public funds. He was acquitted by the Taipei District Court on 15 November 2013. Prosecutors appealed the ruling, but on 20 August 2014, Lee was cleared of the charges again.

== Personal life ==

Lee and his wife were Presbyterian Christians.

=== Family ===
Lee married Tseng Wen-hui on 9 February 1949, with whom he had three children. Their firstborn son Lee Hsien-wen (c. 1950 – 21 March 1982) died of sinus cancer. Daughters Anna and Annie, were born c. 1952 and c. 1954, respectively.

=== Health ===
Shortly after stepping down from the presidency in 2000, Lee had coronary artery bypass surgery. In late 2011, he underwent surgery to remove stage II colon adenocarcinoma, the most common form of colon cancer. Two years later, he had a stent implanted in his vertebral artery following an occlusion. Lee was sent to Taipei Veterans General Hospital in November 2015 after experiencing numbness in his right hand, and later diagnosed with a minor stroke. On 29 November 2018, he was rushed to Taipei Veterans General Hospital after falling and hitting his head. He was discharged from hospital on 31 January 2019, and President Tsai Ing-wen later visited him at his home. On 8 February 2020, Lee was hospitalised at Taipei Veterans General Hospital after choking while drinking milk and retained in the hospital under observation due to lung infection concerns. Later, he was diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia caused by pulmonary infiltration, and was subsequently intubated.

=== Death ===
Lee died of multiple organ failure and septic shock at Taipei Veterans General Hospital on 7:24 pm, 30 July 2020, at the age of 97. He had suffered from infections and cardiac problems since he was admitted to hospital in February.

A state funeral was announced, while a memorial venue at the Taipei Guest House where people paid respects to Lee was opened to the public from 1 to 16 August 2020, after which Lee&#x27;s body was cremated and his remains interred at Wuzhi Mountain Military Cemetery. All national flags at government institutions were placed at half-mast for three days.

== Legacy ==
Lee had the nickname &quot;Mr. Democracy&quot; and Taiwan&#x27;s &quot;Father of Democracy&quot; for his actions to democratize Taiwanese government and his opposition to ruling Communists in China.

Kuomintang members still blame Lee for losing the political party&#x27;s long-term rule of the country and believe that Lee&#x27;s moves led to the fragmentation of the KMT. On the other hand, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) views Lee positively as a beacon of hope. The DPP had grown in strength under Lee&#x27;s rule and he set a precedent by presiding over the first ever peaceful transition of power to an opposition party in 2000.

A November 2020 phone survey of 1,076 Taiwan citizens aged 18 and above which asked the question: &quot;Which president, after Taiwan&#x27;s democratisation, do you think has the best leadership? Lee Teng-hui, Chen Shui-bian, Ma Ying-jeou, or Tsai Ing-wen?&quot; revealed Lee topped the survey with 43 percent, with incumbent president Tsai on 32 percent, Ma on 18 percent and 6.6 percent for Chen.

<text>&quot;Mainland China&quot;, also referred to as &quot;the Chinese mainland&quot;, is a geopolitical term defined as the territory under direct administration of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) in the aftermath of the Chinese Civil War. In addition to the geographical mainland, the geopolitical sense of the term includes islands such as Hainan, Chongming, and Zhoushan. By convention, territories outside of mainland China include:
* Special administrative regions of the PRC, which are regarded as subdivisions of the country, but retain distinct administrative, judicial and economic systems from those on the mainland:
** Hong Kong, formerly a British colony
** Macau, formerly a Portuguese colony

In Taiwan it is also often used to refer to all territories administered by the PRC. The term is widely used in all of the above territories as well as internationally, including by many Overseas Chinese communities.

==Background==
In 1949, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the People&#x27;s Liberation Army had largely defeated the Kuomintang (KMT)&#x27;s National Revolutionary Army in the Chinese Civil War. This forced the Kuomintang to relocate the government and institution of the Republic of China to the relative safety of Taiwan, an island which was placed under its control after the surrender of Japan at the end of World War II in 1945. With the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China on 1 October 1949, the CCP-controlled government saw itself as the sole legitimate government of China, competing with the claims of the Republic of China, whose authority is now limited to Taiwan and other islands. This resulted in a situation in which two co-existing governments competed for international legitimacy and recognition as the &quot;government of China&quot;. With the democratisation of Taiwan in the 1990s and the rise of the Taiwanese independence movement, some people began simply using the term &quot;China&quot; instead.

Due to their status as colonies of foreign states during the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949, the phrase &quot;mainland China&quot; excludes Hong Kong and Macau. Since the return of Hong Kong and Macau to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 and 1999, respectively, the two territories have retained their legal, political, and economic systems. The territories also have their distinct identities. Therefore, &quot;mainland China&quot; generally continues to exclude these territories, because of the &quot;one country, two systems&quot; policy adopted by the Chinese government towards the regions. The term is also used in economic indicators, such as the IMD Competitiveness Report. International news media often use &quot;China&quot; to refer only to mainland China or the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

==Political use==
===People&#x27;s Republic of China===
The Exit and Entry Administration Law of the People&#x27;s Republic of China () defines two terms in Chinese that are translated to &quot;mainland&quot;:
* &quot;Dàlù&quot; (), which means &#x27;the continent&#x27;. 
* &quot;Nèidì&quot; (), literally &#x27;inland&#x27; or &#x27;inner land&#x27;. It excludes Hong Kong and Macau.

In the PRC, usage of the two terms is not strictly interchangeable. To emphasise the One-China policy and not give the ROC &quot;equal footing&quot; in cross-strait relations, the term must be used in PRC&#x27;s official contexts with reference to Taiwan (with the PRC referring to itself as the &quot;mainland side&quot; dealing with the &quot;Taiwan side&quot;). In fact, the PRC government mandates that journalists use “Taiwan” and “the Mainland” (Dàlù) as corresponding concepts.

But in terms of Hong Kong and Macau, the PRC government refers to itself as &quot;the Central People&#x27;s Government&quot;. In the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the term (Nèidì, &#x27;inland&#x27;) is often contrasted with the term (&#x27;outside the border&#x27;) for things outside the mainland region. Examples include &quot;Administration of Foreign-funded Banks&quot; () or the &quot;Measures on Administration of Representative Offices of Foreign Insurance Institutions&quot; ().

Hainan is an island, but is nevertheless commonly considered to be part of the &quot;mainland&quot; politically, because its government, legal and political systems do not differ from the rest of the PRC. Nonetheless, Hainanese people still refer to the geographic mainland as &quot;the mainland&quot; and call its residents &quot;mainlanders&quot;.

Before 1949, the Kinmen and Matsu islands, were jointly governed with the rest of Fujian Province under successive Chinese governments. The two territories are generally considered to belong to the same historical region, Fujian Province, which has been divided since 1949 as a result of the civil war. However, because they are not controlled by the PRC, they are not included as part of &quot;mainland China.&quot;

Some platforms like Bilibili banned the use of the term &quot;mainland China&quot; in their website and classified the behavior in its convention as an illegal act of splitting the country and undermining the integrity of national sovereignty, which violates law. They require that the term should be replaced as &quot;Chinese mainland&quot;, &quot;China&#x27;s mainland&quot; and &quot;the mainland of China&quot;.

===Hong Kong and Macau===
Hong Kong and Macau have been territories of the PRC since 1997 and 1999 respectively. However, due to the One Country, Two Systems policy, the two regions maintain a degree of autonomy, hence they are not governed as part of mainland China.

Geographically speaking, Hong Kong and Macau are both connected to mainland China in certain areas (e.g. the north of the New Territories). Additionally, the islands contained within Hong Kong (e.g. Hong Kong Island) and Macau are much closer to mainland China than Taiwan and Hainan, and are much smaller.

In Hong Kong and Macau, the terms &quot;mainland China&quot; and &quot;mainlander&quot; are frequently used for people from PRC-governed areas (i.e. not Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau). The Chinese term &quot;Neidi&quot; (), meaning the &quot;inland&quot; but still translated &quot;mainland&quot; in English, is commonly applied by SAR governments to represent non-SAR areas of PRC, including Hainan province and coastal regions of mainland China, such as &quot;Constitutional and Mainland Affairs&quot; () and Immigration Departments. In the Mainland and Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (as well as the Mainland and Macau Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement) the CPG also uses the Chinese characters &quot;inner land&quot;, with the note that they refer to the &quot;customs territory of China&quot;.

===Taiwan (Republic of China)===

References to the PRC and other lost continental territories as the mainland began appearing in Taiwan state documents as early as 1954.

Legal definitions followed in the 1990s. The 1991 Additional Articles of the Constitution of the Republic of China stated that &quot;the handling of people&#x27;s rights and obligations and other affairs between the free area and the mainland can be specially stipulated by law&quot;, and used the legal term &quot;mainland area&quot; without defining its geographical boundaries. The 1992 Regulations on the Relations between the People in Taiwan and the Mainland defined &quot;Taiwan&quot; as areas controlled by the ROC and &quot;mainland&quot; as &quot;the territory of the Republic of China.&quot; The related Cross-Strait Act called those under PRC jurisdiction - excluding those in Hong Kong and Macau - as &quot;people of the mainland area&quot;, and used &quot;free area of the Republic of China&quot; to describe areas under ROC control. The issue on the mainland&#x27;s territory also stated in the Judicial Yuan Interpretation No. 328 in 1993. In 2012, the Supreme Court of the Republic of China&#x27;s judgment #900 labeled the Macao Special Administrative Region as the &quot;Mainland&#x27;s Macau Area&quot;. The 2002 amendments to the Implementation Rules of the Regulations on People Relations between Taiwan and mainland China defined the mainland as areas claimed but not controlled by the ROC, corresponding to &quot;areas under control of the Chinese Communists&quot; (within the &quot;de facto&quot; borders of the People&#x27;s Republic of China).

Views of the term &quot;mainland China&quot; () vary on Taiwan. During the Dangguo era, the KMT had previously referred to the territories under the control of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) by several different names, e.g. &quot;(territory controlled by the) Communist bandits&quot;, &quot;occupied/unfree area (of China)&quot;, &quot;Communist China&quot; (as opposed to either &quot;Nationalist China&quot; or &quot;Democratic China&quot;), &quot;Red China&quot; (as opposed to &quot;Blue China&quot;), and &quot;mainland China (area)&quot;. In modern times, many of these terms have fallen out of use. The terms &quot;mainland China&quot; () or &quot;the mainland&quot; () still remain in popular use, but some also simply use the term &quot;China&quot; (). The former term is generally preferred by the Pan-Blue Coalition led by the KMT, while the latter term is preferred by the Pan-Green Coalition led by the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which opposes the term &quot;mainland&quot; and its suggestion that Taiwan is part of China. This has caused many political debates.

== Inland China ==
Inland China or simply Inland is a political and legal term used in the People&#x27;s Republic of China. It refers to the areas under the jurisdiction of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, excluding the regions of Hong Kong and Macao. This term is often used in contexts where the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau are mentioned, and in some cases, it is synonymous with &quot;Mainland China&quot;. Nevertheless, in Taiwan, &quot;Mainland China&quot; is also often used to refer to all territories administered by the People&#x27;s Republic of China including Hong Kong and Macao.

=== Legal uses ===
==== Inland China ====
On 30 December 1954, the Supreme People&#x27;s Court of the People&#x27;s Republic of China addressed a marital issue between a spouse residing in Inland and another residing in Hong Kong or Macau. The court used the term &quot;Inland&quot; in its official response, &quot;Reply of the Supreme People&#x27;s Court Regarding the Handling Opinions on Marital Issues with One Spouse Residing in Inland and the Other in Hong Kong or Macau.&quot; This terminology arose from a divorce case between a person from Hong Kong and another from Zhoushan.

On 6 December 1984, in a reply by the Supreme People&#x27;s Court titled &quot;Reply of the Supreme People&#x27;s Court on the Issue of Whether Civil Cases Involving Hong Kong and Macau Compatriots Holding &#x27;British National Overseas Passports&#x27; Issued by the Hong Kong British Authorities and Identity Cards Issued by the Macau Portuguese Authorities in Inland Chinese People’s Courts Should Be Treated as Foreign-Related Cases,&quot; it was pointed out that holders of such documents are considered Chinese citizens, not recognizing them as having British or Portuguese nationality; hence their civil cases in Inland Chinese courts should not be treated as foreign-related cases.

On 30 June 2012, the Eleventh National People&#x27;s Congress passed Article 89 of the &quot;Exit and Entry Administration Law of the People&#x27;s Republic of China,&quot; which states: &quot;Exiting refers to traveling from Inland China to other countries or regions, from Inland China to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the Macau Special Administrative Region, or from the Mainland China to the Taiwan region&quot;. This law symmetrically aligns &quot;Inland China&quot; with the Hong Kong and Macau Special Administrative Regions, and in English versions, both are uniformly translated as &quot;Chinese Mainland&quot;.

Additionally, the term &quot;Inland residents&quot; is commonly used in contexts related to immigration control, tourism, and marriage, such as individual travel from Hong Kong and Macau, and Inland Travel Permits for Hong Kong and Macau residents.

==== Hong Kong ====
In 1997, the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress (NPC) passed the &quot;Decision of the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress on Handling the Existing Laws of Hong Kong in Accordance with Article 160 of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People&#x27;s Republic of China&quot;, which required that any references in Hong Kong laws to &quot;Mainland,&quot; &quot;Taiwan,&quot; &quot;Hong Kong,&quot; and &quot;Macau&quot; should be interpreted as referring to parts of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The Hong Kong Interpretation and General Clauses Ordinance stipulates that &quot;‘China’ refers to the People&#x27;s Republic of China&quot;, and &quot;‘the People&#x27;s Republic of China’ includes the Hong Kong and Macau Special Administrative Regions&quot;.

In 2003, the Ministry of Commerce and the Financial Secretary of Hong Kong signed the &quot;Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA) between Inland and Hong Kong&quot; defining &quot;Inland&quot; as &quot;all the tariff territory of the People&#x27;s Republic of China&quot;.

After Hong Kong&#x27;s return in 1997, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government began to frequently use the term &quot;Inland&quot; in official documents and press releases, replacing terms commonly used during the British colonial period such as &quot;China&quot; or &quot;Chinese Mainland&quot;. In Hong Kong laws, &quot;Inland&quot; is defined as any part of China except for Hong Kong and Macau. For example, Hong Kong&#x27;s Air Pollution Control (Ocean Going Vessels) (Fuel at Berth) Regulation, Cap 311AA, specifies that &quot;Inland means any part of China, but excludes Hong Kong and Macau.&quot; The Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link (Co-location) Ordinance, Cap 632, defines &quot;Inland&quot; as &quot;parts of China other than Hong Kong and Macau&quot;.

On 1 April 2006, the &quot;Inland Affairs Liaison Office,&quot; under the Constitutional Affairs Bureau, was established, and on 1 July 2007, during the administration of Donald Tsang, it was renamed the &quot;Constitutional and Inland Affairs Bureau&quot;.

==== Macao ====
In 1999, the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress (NPC) passed the &quot;Decision of the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress on Handling the Existing Laws of Macau in Accordance with Article 145 of the Basic Law of the Macau Special Administrative Region of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.&quot; This decision required that any references in Macau&#x27;s laws that mentioned Inland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau, either individually or together, should be interpreted as referring to parts of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Law No. 1/1999 of Macau, also known as the &quot;Reunification Law,&quot; restated relevant parts of the decision in its Annex IV.

In 2003, the Ministry of Commerce and Macau&#x27;s Secretary for Economy and Finance signed the &quot;Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA) between Inland and Macau&quot; which defined &quot;Inland&quot; as &quot;all the tariff territory of the People&#x27;s Republic of China&quot;.

After the handover in 1999, the Macau Special Administrative Region government began to use the term &quot;Inland&quot; extensively in official documents and press releases, replacing the terms commonly used during the Portuguese administration. In Macau&#x27;s laws and international treaties where the term &quot;international&quot; is involved, this generally excludes Inland China and Hong Kong. For example, in the &quot;Air Services Agreement between the Government of the Macau Special Administrative Region of the People&#x27;s Republic of China and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,&quot; it is stipulated that &quot;locations in Inland China and Hong Kong shall not be used as intermediate or beyond points.&quot;

=== Usage in entertainment industry ===
In order to differentiate from the entertainment industries of Europe, America, Taiwan, Japan, Korea, and Hong Kong, the entertainment industry in Inland China is often referred to as the &quot;Inland entertainment industry&quot; or simply &quot;Inland entertainment.&quot; Artists who have developed their careers within the People&#x27;s Republic of China are also referred to as &quot;Inland artists&quot;.

<text>Cultural genocide or culturicide is a concept first described by Polish lawyer Raphael Lemkin in 1944, in the same book that coined the term &quot;genocide&quot;. The destruction of culture was a central component in Lemkin&#x27;s formulation of genocide. Though the precise definition of &quot;cultural genocide&quot; remains contested, the United Nations does not include it in the definition of &quot;genocide&quot; used in the 1948 Genocide Convention. The Armenian Genocide Museum defines culturicide as &quot;acts and measures undertaken to destroy nations&#x27; or ethnic groups&#x27; culture through spiritual, national, and cultural destruction&quot;, which appears to be essentially the same as ethnocide. Some ethnologists, such as Robert Jaulin, use the term &quot;ethnocide&quot; as a substitute for &quot;cultural genocide&quot;, although this usage has been criticized as risking the confusion between ethnicity and culture. Cultural genocide and ethnocide have in the past been utilized in distinct contexts. Cultural genocide without ethnocide is conceivable when a distinct ethnic identity is kept, but distinct cultural elements are eliminated. 

Culturicide involves the eradication and destruction of cultural artifacts, such as books, artworks, and structures. The issue is addressed in multiple international treaties, including the Geneva Conventions and the Rome Statute, which define war crimes associated with the destruction of culture. Cultural genocide may also involve forced assimilation, as well as the suppression of a language or cultural activities that do not conform to the destroyer&#x27;s notion of what is appropriate. Among many other potential reasons, cultural genocide may be committed for religious motives (e.g., iconoclasm which is based on aniconism); as part of a campaign of ethnic cleansing in an attempt to remove the evidence of a people from a specific locale or history; as part of an effort to implement a Year Zero, in which the past and its associated culture is deleted and history is &quot;reset&quot;. The drafters of the 1948 Genocide Convention initially considered using the term, but later dropped it from inclusion. The term &quot;cultural genocide&quot; has been considered in various draft United Nations declarations, but it is not used by the UN Genocide Convention.

== History ==

=== Etymology ===
The notion of &#x27;cultural genocide&#x27; was acknowledged as early as 1944, when lawyer Raphael Lemkin distinguished a cultural component of genocide. In 1989, Robert Badinter, a French criminal lawyer known for his stance against the death penalty, used the term &quot;cultural genocide&quot; on a television show to describe what he said was the disappearance of Tibetan culture in the presence of the 14th Dalai Lama. The Dalai Lama would later use the term in 1993 and again in 2008.

===United Nations proposals===
The concept of cultural genocide was originally included in drafts of the 1948 Genocide Convention. Genocide was defined as the destruction of a group&#x27;s language, religion, or culture through one of several methods. This definition of genocide was rejected by the drafting committee by a vote of 25 to 16, with 4 abstentions.

Article 7 of a 1994 draft of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (DRIP) uses the phrase &quot;cultural genocide&quot; but does not define what it means. The complete article in the draft read as follows:
:Indigenous peoples have the collective and individual right not to be subjected to ethnocide and cultural genocide, including prevention of and redress for:
::(a) Any action which has the aim or effect of depriving them of their integrity as distinct peoples, or of their cultural values or ethnic identities;
::(b) Any action which has the aim or effect of dispossessing them of their lands, territories or resources;
::(c) Any form of population transfer which has the aim or effect of violating or undermining any of their rights;
::(d) Any form of assimilation or integration by other cultures or ways of life imposed on them by legislative, administrative or other measures;
::(e) Any form of propaganda directed against them.

This wording only ever appeared in a draft. The DRIP—which was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly during its 62nd session at UN Headquarters in New York City on 13 September 2007—only makes reference to genocide once, when it mentions &quot;genocide, or any other act of violence&quot; in Article 7. Though the concept of &quot;ethnocide&quot; and &quot;cultural genocide&quot; was removed in the version adopted by the General Assembly, the sub-points from the draft noted above were retained (with slightly expanded wording) in Article 8 that speaks to &quot;the right not to be subject to forced assimilation.&quot;

== Relation to genocide ==

The United Nations does not include cultural genocide in the definition of &quot;genocide&quot; used in the 1948 Genocide Convention:
While not qualifying as genocide under the Convention, the issue is addressed in multiple international treaties, including the Geneva Conventions and the Rome Statute, which define war crimes associated with the destruction of culture.

== List of cultural genocides ==
The term has been used to describe the destruction of cultural heritage in connection with various events which mostly occurred during the 20th century:

=== Europe ===
* Historian Stephen Wheatcroft states that the Soviet peasantry was subject to cultural destruction during the creation of the &quot;New Soviet man&quot;, Lynne Viola makes a similar characterization of Collectivization in the Soviet Union adding a noted colonial character to the project in their observation of the event. 
* During the genocide of the Chechens and Ingush in 1944, Soviet forces destroyed almost every piece of Chechen and Ingush language literature in existence, and damaged or destroyed many Chechen and Ingush cultural sites and artifacts, including towers in the highlands that had been built to resist Mongol invasions in the 13th century. Chechens and Ingush gravestones were destroyed, and when the Chechens and Ingush were allowed to return to their homes a decade later, they were forbidden from settling in their ancestral mountain lands. 
* In reference to the Axis powers (primarily, Nazi Germany)&#x27;s policies towards some nations during World War II (ex. the German occupation of Poland &amp; the destruction of Polish culture).
* Nazi forces committed cultural genocide against Serbian cultural treasures during the Invasion of Yugoslavia in 1941. On Hitler&#x27;s direct order, the National Library in Belgrade was bombed and thousands of valuable documents were burned. Many other cultural institutions and monuments were looted.
* In the Bosnian War during the Siege of Sarajevo, cultural genocide was committed by Bosnian Serb forces. The National and University Library of Bosnia and Herzegovina was specifically targeted and besieged by cannons positioned all around the city. The National Library was completely destroyed in the fire, along with 80 per cent of its contents. Some 3 million books were destroyed, along with hundreds of original documents from the Ottoman Empire and the Austro-Hungarian monarchy.
* 2004 unrest in Kosovo. In an urgent appeal, issued on 18 March by the extraordinary session of the Expanded Convocation of the Holy Synod of Serbian Orthodox Church (), it was reported that a number of Serbian churches and shrines in Kosovo had been damaged or destroyed by Albanian rioters. At least 30 sites were completely destroyed, more or less destroyed, or further destroyed (sites that had been previously damaged).
*After the Greek Civil War, Greek authorities had conducted a cultural genocide upon Slavic Macedonians in Northern Greece through prohibition of communication in Slavic languages, renaming of cities, towns and villages (Lerin/Лерин to Florina etc.), deportation of Slavic Macedonians, particularly women and children, as well as many other actions intended to marginalize and oppress the Slavic Macedonians residing in Northern Greece. While some of these actions had been motivated by political ideology, as many of the Slavic Macedonians had sided with the defeated communists, the majority of actions were committed to wipe out any traces of Slavic Macedonians or their culture in Northern Greece.
*Turkey: Especially in the island of Imbros. The island was primarily inhabited by ethnic Greeks from antiquity until approximately the 1960s, when many were forced to flee due to a campaign of cultural genocide and discrimination enacted by the Turkish government. Massive scale persecution against the local Greeks started in 1961, as part of the &quot;Eritme Programmi&quot; operation that aimed at the elimination of Greek education and the enforcement of economic, psychological pressure and violence. Under these conditions, the Turkish government approved the appropriation of &gt;90% of the cultivated areas of the island and the settlement of additional 6,000 ethnic Turks from mainland Turkey. Finally, the island was also officially renamed by Turkey in 1970 to &quot;Gökçeada&quot; to finalize the removal of any remaining Greek influence. 
*Francoist Spain: the prohibition of the use of minority languages such as Catalan or Galician in the public space, from schools to shops, public transport, or even in the streets, the banning of the use of Catalan or Galician birth names for children, the renaming of cities, streets and all toponyms from Catalan, Basque or Galician to Castilian-Spanish, and the abolition of government and all cultural institutions in Catalonia, Valencia and the Balearic Islands as well as in Basque Country and Galicia with the goal of total cultural suppression and assimilation. 
** John D. Hargreaves writes that &quot;A policy of cultural genocide was implemented: the Catalan language and key symbols of Catalan independent identity and nationhood, such as the flag (the senyera), the national hymn (&#x27;Els Segadors&#x27;) and the national dance (the sardana), were proscribed. Any sign of independence or opposition, in fact, was brutally suppressed. Catalan identity and consequently the Catalan nation were threatened with extinction.&quot; 
** Although Josep Pla and other Catalan authors published books in Catalan in the 1950s, and even there were prizes of Catalan Literature during Francoism like the Premi Sant Jordi de novel·la, editorial production in Catalan never recovered the peak levels it had reached before Spanish Civil War. A prominent case of popularization of Catalan was Joan Manuel Serrat: although he could compose Catalan songs and gained certain notoriety, he was not allowed to sing in Catalan in the Eurovision contest its La, la, la theme, and was replaced by Spanish singer Massiel, who won the Eurovision contest. Overall, despite some tolerance as Franco&#x27;s regime relaxed in the late 60s and early 70s, Catalan and the rest of minority languages of Spain were strictly banned from higher education, administration and all official endeavors, thus being in practice confined to the private sphere and domestic uses (see Language policies of Francoist Spain).
* During the 19th and early 20th centuries, some schools in Wales adopted the Welsh Not policy to discourage students from speaking Welsh instead of English. Under this total immersion policy, students caught speaking Welsh were punished, most typically by having a lump of wood with the letters &quot;WN&quot; placed around their neck. Though the policy enjoyed widespread support among parents and the general public in Wales, some Welsh nationalists have described it as an example of cultural genocide. Academic Martin Johnes noted that despite the Welsh Not not being an official state policy, instead coming down to actions taken by individual teachers, it nonetheless remains &quot;a powerful symbol of the oppression of Welsh culture.&quot;
* Numerous academics have argued Ireland was subject to cultural genocide under British rule, specifically focusing on attempts to suppress the Irish language, the culture of Ireland and the Catholic Church in Ireland. Academics Paul Bartrop, Tomás Mac Síomóin and Christopher Murray claimed that attempts to suppress the Irish language by the Dublin Castle administration amounted to a cultural genocide, and scholar Hilary Carey argued that the penal transportation of Irish convicts to Australia was also a cultural genocide.
*France&#x27;s policies (also known as &quot;Vergonha&quot;, &quot;shame,&quot; in Occitan) towards its various regional and minority languages, referring to non-standard French as patois, have been described as genocide by professor of Catalan philology at the University of the Balearic Islands Jaume Corbera i Pou who argues,

When at the mid-19th century, primary school is made compulsory all across the State, it is also made clear that only French will be taught, and the teachers will severely punish any pupil speaking in &quot;patois&quot;. The aim of the French educational system will consequently not be to dignify the pupils&#x27; natural humanity, developing their culture and teaching them to write their language, but rather to humiliate them and morally degrade them for the simple fact of being what tradition and their nature made them. The self-proclaimed country of the &quot;human rights&quot; will then ignore one of man&#x27;s most fundamental rights, the right to be himself and speak the language of his nation. And with that attitude France, the &quot;grande France&quot; that calls itself the champion of liberty, will pass the 20th century, indifferent to the timid protest movements of the various linguistic communities it submitted and the literary prestige they may have given birth to.

France, that under Franco&#x27;s reign was seen here [in Catalonia] as the safe haven of freedom, has the miserable honour of being the [only] State of Europe—and probably the world – that succeeded best in the diabolical task of destroying its own ethnic and linguistic patrimony and moreover, of destroying human family bonds: many parents and children, or grandparents and grandchildren, have different languages, and the latter feel ashamed of the first because they speak a despicable &quot;patois&quot;, and no element of the grandparents&#x27; culture has been transmitted to the younger generation, as if they were born out of a completely new world. This is the French State that has just entered the 21st century, a country where stone monuments and natural landscapes are preserved and respected, but where many centuries of popular creation expressed in different tongues are on the brink of extinction. The &quot;gloire&quot; and the &quot;grandeur&quot; built on a genocide. No liberty, no equality, no fraternity: just cultural extermination, this is the real motto of the French Republic.

* Ukraine. As of February 29, 2024, according to the published data of the Prime Minister of Ukraine, Denys Shmyhal, about 900 objects of national heritage were damaged or destroyed in the occupied zones of Ukraine, and more than 20 thousand cultural monuments are under occupation. 

===Asia===
* The persecution of Baháʼís in Iran as a case of religious persecution has been called a cultural genocide.
* Azerbaijan&#x27;s destruction, appropriation, and denial of Armenian heritage sites in Nakhchivan and Nagorno-Karabakh have been characterized as ethnocide or potential cultural genocide and condemned by the International Court of Justice and European Parliament. The destruction of thousands of medieval Armenian Churches, khachkars and gravestones at the Armenian cemetery in Julfa is a prominent example.
* Turkey&#x27;s destruction of Armenian cultural heritage in Turkey both during as well as in the decades after the Armenian genocide.
* Historian Sarah Cameron believes that while the Kazakh famine of 1931–1933 combined with a campaign against nomads was not genocide in the sense of the Genocide Convention&#x27;s definition, it complies with Raphael Lemkin&#x27;s original concept of genocide, which considered destruction of culture to be as genocidal as physical annihilation. 
* Japanese occupation of Korea. Japan&#x27;s extensive policy of cultural genocide included forcibly changing Korean names to Japanese names, the exclusive use of the Japanese language, school instruction in the Japanese &quot;ethical system&quot;, and Shinto worship.
* The Sinicization of Tibet from the 1950s onwards. Following the 1959 Tibetan uprising, 97% of Tibet&#x27;s monasteries were destroyed, while 2 million Tibetans, including 500,000 nomadic farmers, were relocated to newly created urban centers.
* The Japanese ban and discrimination which the Ainu and Ryukyuan cultures have been subjected to as well as other regional cultures.
* The &quot;Destruction of the Four Olds&quot; in the People&#x27;s Republic of China during the Cultural Revolution, in which Red Guards destroyed various religious, cultural, and historical sites throughout the country, especially in Beijing as well as in the Temple of Confucius in Shandong.
*Democratic Kampuchea (1975–1979), particularly its policies towards both the Kingdom of Cambodia (1953–1970) and the Khmer Republic (1970–1975).
*The newly-reunified Vietnam after the end of the Vietnam War, particularly its policies towards South Vietnam.
*The persecution of Sri Lankan Tamils during the Sri Lankan Civil War was a campaign of ethnic cleansing which was sponsored by the government and it has continued until the present day as a part of the Sinhalaisation of the northern and eastern parts of the island.
*The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant&#x27;s forcible conversions in its territory as well as its destruction of ancient Assyrian, Roman, Yazidi and Christian heritage sites and museums.
*The persecution of Uyghurs in China. Some one million members of China&#x27;s Muslim Uyghur minority have been detained in massive detention camps, termed &quot;reeducation camps&quot;, which exist for the purpose of changing the political thinking, identities and religious beliefs of the detainees, under the guise of &quot;anti-terrorism&quot;. Satellite evidence suggests that China has also razed more than two dozen Uyghur Muslim religious sites to the ground.
*The persecution of Bengali Hindus during the Partition of India and 1971 Civil War in Pakistan was a campaign of ethnic cleansing which was sponsored by the government of Pakistan and later by the government of Bangladesh and it has continued until the present day as a part of the Islamisation of Bangladesh.

===Oceania===
* The Stolen Generations in Australia where half-caste children were removed from their families.
* In the year 1896, the United States enacted a law in Hawaii that made the use of the English language compulsory in schools, which led to the decline of the use of the Hawaiian language in Hawaii.

===North America===

*Indigenous peoples in the United States. 
**In the mid-1800s to early 1900s, the United States established American Indian boarding schools to assimilate Native American children and youth into Euro-American culture.
*Canadian genocide of Indigenous peoples. 
**The Indian Residential Schools Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada concluded that the Canadian Indian residential school system &quot;can best be described as &#x27;cultural genocide.
**In 2015, Chief Justice Beverly McLachlin, of the Supreme Court of Canada, stated in a speech to the Global Centre for Pluralism that Canada&#x27;s historical treatment of Indigenous peoples was an attempt at cultural genocide, and &quot;the worst stain on Canada&#x27;s human-rights record.&quot;

<text>Theales is a botanical name at the rank of order. Early classifications such as that of Dahlgren placed the Theales in the superorder Theiflorae (also called Theanae). The name was used by the Cronquist system for an order placed in subclass Dilleniidae, in the 1981 version of the system the circumscription was:

* order Theales
*: family Ochnaceae
*: family Sphaerosepalaceae
*: family Dipterocarpaceae
*: family Caryocaraceae
*: family Theaceae
*: family Actinidiaceae
*: family Scytopetalaceae
*: family Pentaphylacaceae
*: family Tetrameristaceae
*: family Pellicieraceae
*: family Oncothecaceae
*: family Marcgraviaceae
*: family Quiinaceae
*: family Elatinaceae
*: family Paracryphiaceae
*: family Medusagynaceae
*: family Clusiaceae

In the APG II system (used here) the taxa involved are assigned to many different orders, among which are Ericales, Malvales, and Malpighiales.

<text>The Scythians ( or ) or Scyths (, but note Scytho- () in composition) and sometimes also referred to as the Pontic Scythians, were an ancient Eastern Iranian equestrian nomadic people who had migrated during the 9th to 8th centuries BC from Central Asia to the Pontic Steppe in modern-day Ukraine and Southern Russia, where they remained established from the 7th century BC until the 3rd century BC.

Skilled in mounted warfare, the Scythians replaced the Agathyrsi and the Cimmerians as the dominant power on the western Eurasian Steppe in the 8th century BC. In the 7th century BC, the Scythians crossed the Caucasus Mountains and frequently raided West Asia along with the Cimmerians.

After being expelled from West Asia by the Medes, the Scythians retreated back into the Pontic Steppe in the 6th century BC, and were later conquered by the Sarmatians in the 3rd to 2nd centuries BC. By the 3rd century AD, last remnants of the Scythians were overwhelmed by the Goths, and by the early Middle Ages, the Scythians were assimilated and absorbed by the various successive populations who had moved into the Pontic Steppe.

After the Scythians&#x27; disappearance, authors of the ancient, mediaeval, and early modern periods used their name to refer to various populations of the steppes unrelated to them.

== Names ==
=== Etymology ===
The name is derived from the Scythian endonym , meaning which was derived from the Proto-Indo-European root &quot;&quot;, itself meaning . This name was semantically similar to the endonym of the Sauromatians, , meaning &quot;armed with throwing darts and arrows.&quot;

From this earlier term was derived:
*the Akkadian designation of the Scythians:
** ();
**or ()
* as well as the Ancient Greek name (), from which was derived the Latin name , which gave the English name .

The Urartian name for the Scythians might have been ().

Due to a sound change from /δ/ () to commonly attested in East Iranic language family to which Scythian belonged, the name evolved into , which was recorded in ancient Greek as (), in which the Greek plural-forming suffix was added to the name.

The name of the 5th century BC king Scyles () represented this later form, .

=== Modern terminology ===
==== Scythians proper ====
The name &quot;Scythians&quot; was initially used by ancient authors to designate specifically the Iranic people who lived in the Pontic Steppe between the Danube and the Don rivers.

In modern archaeology, the term &quot;Scythians&quot; is used in its original narrow sense as a name strictly for the Iranic people who lived in the Pontic and Crimean Steppes, between the Danube and Don rivers, from the 7th to 3rd centuries BC.

==== Broader designations ====
By the Hellenistic period, authors such as Hecataeus of Miletus however sometimes extended the designation &quot;Scythians&quot; indiscriminately to all steppe nomads and forest steppe populations living in Europe and Asia, and used it to also designate the Saka of Central Asia.

Early modern scholars tended to follow the lead of the Hellenistic authors in extending the name &quot;Scythians&quot; into a general catch-all term for the various equestrian warrior-nomadic cultures of the Iron Age-period Eurasian Steppe following the discovery in the 1930s in the eastern parts of the Eurasian steppe of items forming the &quot;Scythian triad,&quot; consisting of distinctive weapons, horse harnesses, and objects decorated in the &quot;Animal Style&quot; art, which had until then been considered to be markers of the Scythians proper.

This broad use of the term &quot;Scythian&quot; has however been criticised for lumping together various heterogeneous populations belonging to different cultures, and therefore leading to several errors in the coverage of the various warrior-nomadic cultures of the Iron Age-period Eurasian Steppe. Therefore, the narrow use of the term &quot;Scythian&quot; as denoting specifically the people who dominated the Pontic Steppe between the 7th and 3rd centuries BC is preferred by Scythologists such as Askold Ivantchik.

Within this broad use, the Scythians proper who lived in the Pontic Steppes are sometimes referred to as .

Modern-day anthropologists instead prefer using the term &quot;Scytho-Siberians&quot; to denote this larger cultural grouping of nomadic peoples living in the Eurasian steppe and forest steppe extending from Central Europe to the limits of the Chinese Zhou Empire, and of which the Pontic Scythians proper were only one section. These various peoples shared the use of the &quot;Scythian triad,&quot; that is of distinctive weapons, horse harnesses and the &quot;Animal Style&quot; art.

The term &quot;Scytho-Siberian&quot; has itself in turn also been criticised since it is sometimes used broadly to include all Iron Age equestrian nomads, including those who were not part of any Scythian or Saka. The scholars Nicola Di Cosmo and Andrzej Rozwadowski instead prefer the use of the term &quot;Early Nomadic&quot; for the broad designation of the Iron Age horse-riding nomads.

====Saka====
While the ancient Persians used the name Saka to designate all the steppe nomads and specifically referred to the Pontic Scythians as (; ), the name &quot;Saka&quot; is used in modern scholarship to designate the Iranic pastoralist nomads who lived in the steppes of Central Asia and East Turkestan in the 1st millennium BC.

====Cimmerians====
The Late Babylonian scribes of the Achaemenid Empire used the name &quot;Cimmerians&quot; to designate all the nomad peoples of the steppe, including the Scythians and Saka.

However, while the Cimmerians were an Iranic people sharing a common language, origins and culture with the Scythians and are archaeologically indistinguishable from the Scythians, all sources contemporary to their activities clearly distinguished the Cimmerians and the Scythians as being two separate political entities.

== History ==

There are two main sources of information on the historical Scythians:
*Akkadian cuneiform texts from Mesopotamia which deal with early Scythian history from 7th century BC;
*and Graeco-Roman sources which cover all of Scythian history, most prominently those written by Herodotus of Halicarnassus, which are less reliable because the information they contain is mixed with folk tales and learnt constructs of historians.

===Pre-Scythian period===
The arrival of the Scythians in Europe was part of the larger process of westwards movement of Central Asian Iranic nomads towards Southeast and Central Europe which lasted from the 1st millennium BC to the 1st millennium AD, and to which also participated other Iranic nomads such as the Cimmerians, Sauromatians, and Sarmatians.

====Beginning of steppe nomadism====
The formation of genuine nomadic pastoralism itself happened in the early 1st millennium BC due to climatic changes which caused the environment in the Central Asian and Siberian steppes to become cooler and drier than before. These changes caused the sedentary mixed farmers of the Bronze Age to become nomadic pastoralists, so that by the 9th century BC all the steppe settlements of the sedentary Bronze Age populations had disappeared, and therefore led to the development of population mobility and the formation of warrior units necessary to protect herds and take over new areas.

These climatic conditions in turn caused the nomadic groups to become transhumant pastoralists constantly moving their herds from one pasture to another in the steppe, and to search for better pastures to the west, in Ciscaucasia and the forest steppe regions of western Eurasia.

====The Chernogorovka-Novocherkassk complex====
The first wave of nomadic populations who originated in the parts of Central Asia corresponding to eastern Kazakhstan or the Altai-Sayan region, had, beginning in the 10th century BC and lasting until the 9th to 8th centuries BC, migrated westwards into the Pontic-Caspian and Pannonian Steppe regions, where they formed new tribal confederations which constituted the Chernogorovka-Novocherkassk complex, among whom were the Agathyrsi in the Pontic Steppe, as well as the Cimmerians in the Caspian Steppe, and possibly the Sigynnae in the Pannonian Steppe. The achaeological and historical records regarding these migrations are however scarce, and permit to sketch only a very broad outline of this complex development.

The Chernogorovka-Novocherkassk complex developed natively in the North Pontic region during the 9th to mid-7th centuries BC from elements which had earlier arrived from Central Asia, due to which it itself exhibited similarities with the other early nomadic cultures of the Eurasian steppe and forest steppe which existed before the 7th century BC, such as the Aržan culture, so that these pre-Scythian early nomadic cultures were part of a unified Aržan-Chernogorovka cultural layer originating from Central Asia.

===Proto-Scythian period===
Like the nomads of the Chernogorovka-Novocherkassk complex, the Scythians originated, along with the Early Sakas, in Central Asia and Siberia in the steppes corresponding to either present-day eastern Kazakhstan or the Altai-Sayan region, which is attested by the continuity of Scythian burial rites and weaponry types with the Karasuk culture, as well as by the origin of the typically Scythian Animal Style art in the Mongolo-Siberian region.

Therefore, the Scythians and the nomads of the Chernogorovka-Novocherkassk complex were closely related populations who shared a common origin, culture, and language, and the earliest Scythians were therefore part of a common Aržan-Chernogorovka cultural layer originating from Central Asia, with the early Scythian culture being materially indistinguishable from the Chernogorovka-Novocherkassk complex.

Going further back, these various steppe nomads shared a common Central Asian origin with the other Iranic peoples such as the Medes, Persians, Parthians, and Sogdians. These various Iranic peoples still shared significant commonalities in terms of language and culture which were visible in how they shared common myths as well as dress and ornament styles until at least the 5th century BC.

The Scythians were already acquainted with quality goldsmithing and sophisticated bronze-casting at this time, as attested by gold pieces found in the 8th century BC Aržan-1 kurgan. Arrowheads from the 1st kurgan of the Aržan burials also suggest that the typical &quot;Scythian-type&quot; socketed arrows made of copper alloy might have originated during this period.

===Migration out of Central Asia===
The second wave of migration of Iranic nomads corresponded to the early Scythians&#x27; arrival from Central Asia into the Caucasian Steppe, which begun in the 9th century BC, when a significant movement of the nomadic peoples of the Eurasian Steppe started after the early Scythians were expelled out of Central Asia by either the Massagetae, who were a powerful nomadic Iranic tribe from Central Asia closely related to them, or by another Central Asian people called the Issedones, forcing the early Scythians to the west, across the Araxes river and into the Caspian and Ciscaucasian Steppes.

This western migration of the early Scythians lasted through the middle 8th century BC, and archaeologically corresponded to the westward movement of a population originating from Tuva in southern Siberia in the late 9th century BC, and arriving in the 8th to 7th centuries BC into Europe, especially into Ciscaucasia, which it reached some time between and , thus following the same migration general path as the first wave of Iranic nomads of the Chernogorovka-Novocherkassk complex.

====Displacement of the Cimmerians====
The Scythians&#x27; westward migration brought them to the Caspian Steppe, in the lands of the Cimmerians, who had themselves originated in the first westward wave of proto-Scythian migrations of nomadic populations who had arrived from Central Asia into the Pontic-Caspian Steppe regions during the 10th century BC.

The Cimmerians at this time were leaving their homelands in the Caspian Steppe to move into West Asia: the Cimmerians might have migrated under the pressure from the Scythians, although sources are lacking for any such pressure on the Cimmerians by the Scythians or of any conflict between these two peoples at this early period. Moreover, the arrival of the Scythians in West Asia about 40 years after the Cimmerians did so suggests there is no available evidence to the later Graeco-Roman account that it was under pressure from Scythians migrating into their territories that the Cimmerians crossed the Caucasus and moved south into West Asia.

The remnants of the Cimmerians in the Caspian Steppe were assimilated by the Scythians, with this absorption of the Cimmerians by the Scythians being facilitated by their similar ethnic backgrounds and lifestyles, thus transferring the dominance of this region from the Cimmerians to the Scythians who were assimilating them, after which the Scythians settled in the Ciscaucasian Steppe where were located the their kingdom&#x27;s headquarters, between the Araxes river to the east, the Caucasus Mountains to the south, and the Maeotian Sea to the west.

The arrival of the Scythians and their establishment in this region in the 7th century BC corresponded to a disturbance of the development of the Cimmerian peoples&#x27; Chernogorovka-Novocherkassk complex, which was thus replaced through a continuous process over the course of to in southern Europe by the early Scythian culture which nevertheless still showed links to the Chernogorovka-Novocherkassk complex. Some aspects of the Scythian culture, such as elements of funerary rituals, ceramics, horse gear, and some weapon types, also showed links to the older Timber Grave culture which had existed in the north Pontic region in the Bronze Age.

===Early (or Archaic) Scythian period===
===Ciscaucasian kingdom===
After their initial westwards migrations, and beginning around , the Scythians settled in the Ciscaucasian Steppe between the Araxes river to the east, the Caucasus mountains to the south, and the Maeotian Sea to the west, and were especially concentrated in the valley of the Kuban river, where would be located their kingdom&#x27;s headquarters until the end of the 7th century BC: the Scythians who first arrived into Ciscaucasia did not consist of large numbers of people and they lived in a small area. During these early phases of Scythian history, Ciscaucasia was where the nomadic state and the culture of the Scythians developed, and it would remain the centre of the Scythian kingdom until around .

Several Scythian royal burials from the 7th century BC, such as those of Krasnoye Znamya at Stavropol, Kelermesskaya, Ulsky Aul, and Kostromskaya Stanitsa, date from this period and constitute evidence of the existence of a wealthy Scythian aristocracy living in Ciscaucasia at this time. These upper class burials exhibited significant differences from commoner burials, implying the existence of important levels of social stratification among the population of the early Scythian kingdom.

In Ciscaucasia, the Scythians came into contact with a heterogeneous group of agrarian Maeotian tribes whom they subjugated, after which they dominated the Maeotians thanks to their mobility and their military units which they needed to conquer new areas and protect their herds. There was significant social differentiation between the Scythians and their native subjects, especially the Maeotians, with the Scythian ruling class being buried in lavishly-equipped kurgans, while the Maeotians were buried in poorly furnished flat cemeteries.

Since the Scythians needed agricultural and craft products from the native populations, they conquered these peoples and established interdependence systems: the Scythians obtained surplus through collecting tribute from the populations of the native Koban and Maeotian cultures of Ciscaucasia, who provided various goods to the Scythians, such as agricultural products and crafted goods like clay and bronze vessels, various weapons, bridles, and horse harness equipment; the Maeotian craftsmen especially made large wide-necked pots, jugs, mugs, and small basins for Scythian customers.

These interactions between the Scythians and Maeotians deepened through the 8th to 7th centuries BC so that it led to the creation of a mixed culture, and some of the local tribes were assimilated into the Scythians and therefore contributed to the growth of the Scythian population. Significant exchanges between the Scythians and the native inhabitants of the Caucasus region also occurred during this period:
*the Scythian culture adopted many elements of the native Ciscaucaucasian cultures, so that the interaction with the various Maeotian tribes contributed significantly to the cultural development of the Scythians;
*the Ciscaucasian peoples were also significantly influenced by the Scythians, so that the burials of the Koban and Colchian cultures contained Scythian-type weapons and horse equipment.
This earliest phase of Scythian culture, called &quot;pre-Kelermes&quot; because they pre-date the Kelermes kurgans containing West Asian objects, formed in the Ciscaucasian Steppe over the course of to . The early Scythian culture thus completed its formation under the partial influence of the native Ciscaucasian cultures, and, to a smaller degree, of the civilisation of West Asia, resulting in Scythian art from Ciscaucasia displaying influences from the Koban culture. The Scythians would especially use helmets of Ciscaucasian origin until the 6th century BC.

====Arrival in West Asia====
=====Cimmerian migration into West Asia=====
During the second half of the 8th century BC and the 7th century BC, the equestrian steppe nomads from Ciscaucasia expanded to the south into West Asia, beginning with the Cimmerians, who did so by crossing the Caucasus Mountains through the Alagir, Darial, and Passes, after which they eventually became active in Transcaucasia, the Iranian Plateau and Anatolia.

=====Reasons for southwards nomad expansion=====
The involvement of the steppe nomads in West Asia happened in the context of the then growth of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, which under its kings Sargon II and Sennacherib had expanded from its core region of the Tigris and Euphrates valleys to rule and dominate a large territory ranging from Que (Plain Cilicia) and the Central and Eastern Anatolian mountains in the north to the Syrian Desert in the south, and from the Taurus Mountains and North Syria and the coast of the Mediterranean Sea in the west to the Iranian Plateau in the east.

Surrounding the Neo-Assyrian Empire were several smaller polities:
*in Anatolia to the northwest, were the kingdoms of:
**Phrygia, with its capital at Gordion, held hegemony over Central and Midwest Anatolia and parts of Cilicia;
**and Lydia;
*Babylon, conquered several times by the Assyrians, in the south;
*Egypt in the southwest;
*Elam, whose capital was Susa, in the southeast of West Asia and the southwest of the Iranian plateau, where they were the main power, with their ruling classes being divided into pro-Assyrian and pro-Babylonian factions;
*and to the immediate north laid the powerful kingdom of Urartu (centred around Ṭušpa), which had established several installations including a system of fortresses and provincial centres over regional communities in eastern Anatolia and the northwest Iranian Plateau, was contesting its southern borderlands with the Neo-Assyrian Empire;
*in the eastern mountains were several weaker polities:
**Ellipi;
**Mannai;
**the city-states of the Medes, who were an Iranic people of West Asia to whom the Scythians and Cimmerians were distantly related.
Beyond the territories under the direct Assyrian rule, especially in its frontiers in Anatolia and the Iranian Plateau, were local rulers who negotiated for their own interests by vacillating between the various rival great powers.

This state of permanent social disruption caused by the rivalries of the great powers of West Asia proved to be a very attractive source of opportunities and wealth for the steppe nomads; and, as the populations of the nomads of the Ciscaucasian Steppe continued to grow, their aristocrats would lead their followers southwards across the Caucasus Mountains in search of adventure and plunder in the volatile status quo then prevailing in West Asia, not unlike the later Ossetian tradition of the ritual plunder called the (), with the occasional raids eventually leading to longer expeditions, in turn leading to groups of nomads choosing to remain in West Asia in search of opportunities as mercenaries or freebooters.

Thus, the Scythians and Cimmerians became active in West Asia in the 7th century BC, where they would vacillate between supporting either the Neo-Assyrian Empire or other local powers, and serve these as mercenaries, depending on what they considered to be in their interests. Their activities would over the course of the late-8th to late-7th centuries BC disrupt the balance of power which had prevailed between the states of Elam, Mannai, the Neo-Assyrian Empire and Urartu on one side and the mountaineer and tribal peoples on the other, eventually leading to significant geopolitical changes in this region.

Nevertheless, a 9th or 8th century BC kurgan from Paphlagonia belonging to a warrior, and containing typical steppe nomad equipment, suggests that nomadic warriors had already been arriving in West Asia since the 9th century BC. Such burials imply that some small groups of steppe nomads from Ciscaucasia might have acted as mercenaries, adventurers and settler groups in West Asia, which laid the ground for the later large scale movement of the Cimmerians and Scythians there.

There appears to have been very little direct connection between the Cimmerians&#x27; migration into West Asia and the Scythians&#x27; later expansion into this same region. Thus, the arrival of the Scythians in West Asia about 40 years after the Cimmerians did so suggests there is no available evidence to the later Graeco-Roman account that it was under pressure from the Scythians migrating into their territories that the Cimmerians crossed the Caucasus and moved south into West Asia.

=====Scythian expansion into West Asia=====
After having settled into Ciscaucasia, the Scythians became the second wave of steppe nomads to expand southwards from there, following the western shore of the Caspian Sea and bypassing the Caucasus Mountains to the east through the Caspian Gates similarly to how the Sarmatians, Alans and Huns would later invade the Arsacid Parthian and Sasanid Persian empires, with the Scythians first arriving in Transcaucasia around , after which they consequently became active in West Asia. This Scythian expansion into West Asia, nonetheless, never lost contact with the core Scythian kingdom located in the Ciscaucasian Steppe and was merely an extension of it, as was the concurrently occurring westward Scythian expansion into the Pontic Steppe.
Once they had finally crossed into West Asia, the Scythians settled in eastern Transcaucasia and the northwest Iranian plateau, between the middle course of the Cyrus and Araxes rivers before expanding into the regions corresponding to present-day Gəncə, Mingəçevir and the Muğan plain in the steppes of what is presently Azerbaijan, which became their centre operations until , and this part of Transcaucasia settled by the Scythians consequently became known in the Akkadian sources from Mesopotamia as the &quot;land of the Scythians&quot; (, ) after them. The neighbours of the Scythians in Transcaucasia at this time were Urartu, Mannai, and the Medes.

Archaeologically, the Scythian movement into Transcaucasia is attested in the form of an expansion of their archaeological culture to the south till the northern foothills of the Caucasus Mountains, and then from Ciscaucasia southwards further to the south along the western coast of the Caspian Sea into Transcaucasia and the Iranian Plateau.

Unlike the Cimmerians, who by then were splitting into a western group which had moved into Anatolia and an eastern group which was migrating into the Iranian Plateau, the Scythians in West Asia remained organised into a single polity centred in Transcaucasia and the northwest Iranian plateau.

Once the Scythians had expanded into Transcaucasia, craftsmen from this region also became their suppliers, so that both Ciscaucasian and Transcaucasian workshops were producing bronze vessels with zoomorphic handles, various types of bowls decorated with stamped and engraved signs, and cast and riveted bronze cauldrons for Scythian customers.

====Arrival in the Pontic Steppe====
From their base in the Ciscaucasian Steppe, the Scythians during the 8th to 7th centuries BC conquered the Pontic and Crimean Steppes to the north of the Black Sea up to the Istros river, whose mouth henceforth formed the southwestern boundary of Scythian territory, while the Eastern Carpathian Mountains blocked their advance to the west, so that the Scythian kingdom&#x27;s limits before its expansion into West Asia were the Carpathian Mountains in the west and the Caucasus Mountains in the south. This initial Scythian population who settled in the Pontic Steppe in the 8th and 7th centuries BC was nevertheless small while the bulk of the Scythian population remained in the Ciscaucasian Steppe.

=====Displacement of the Agathyrsi=====
The migration of the Scythians into the Pontic Steppe affected the steppe and forest steppe areas of South-West Europe and pushed several other populations of the region towards more remote regions.

Among the many populations displaced by the Scythian expansion were the Agathyrsi, who were another nomadic Iranic people who also originated in the same first wave of Central Asian nomads to have migrated into the western steppes as the Cimmerians, and therefore belonged to same the Chernogorovka-Novocherkassk complex as the Cimmerians, thus making the Agathyrsi the oldest of the Scythian-related Iranic populations to have dominated the Pontic Steppe.

The incoming migration of the Scythians from the east pushed the Agathyrsi westwards, out of the Pontic Steppe, with the Scythians themselves replacing them as the main population of this region, thus completing the process of the Scythians becoming the main dominant population of the Pontic Steppe over the course of to . The Agathyrsi henceforth became the immediate neighbours of the Scythians to their west and the relations between these two tribes remained hostile.

Early Scythian-type remains found in Central Europe, especially on the Thracian and Pannonian plains, correspond partly to the Agathyrsi and to other smaller groups who were also displaced from the Pontic Steppe into the region of the Carpathians.

=====Activities in Europe=====
======Raids into Central Europe======
Using the Pontic Steppe as their base, from around the Scythians often raided into Central and Southeast Europe, due to which weapons and horse-equipment originating from the steppes started appearing around in Central Europe.

======Relations with the forest steppe======
To the north of the Pontic Steppe was the East European forest steppe, which was divided into several separate zones by the large rivers which flowed southwards across it into the Black Sea. This forest steppe region was inhabited by several different native cultural groups, with the tribes further north being outside the range of Scythian influence.

The forest steppe tribes to the south meanwhile had since been the Bronze Age been organised into large mixed farming communities who had close links with the Scythians and traded with them, leading to the ruling classes of these forest tribes copying Scythian burial styles; during the 7th century BC, these forest steppe mixed farmers were coming under Scythian influence, due to which their daily lives began to resemble to some extent that of the militaristic nomadic lifestyle of the Scythians. Nevertheless, much of these forest steppe peoples&#x27; cultures continued many of their early local traits, especially regarding commoner burial traditions, pottery, and local decorations, meaning that they remained distinct from the culture of the nomadic Scythians.

Beginning in the 7th century BC itself, the Scythians initiated a long period of military conflict by attempting to impose their rule over the forest steppe tribes, in response to which these latter peoples built large numbers of fortified settlements to repel these attacks.

====Presence in West Asia====
During the 7th century BC, the Scythians were present in both Cis- and Trauscaucasia: to the south of the Caucasus Mountains, the Scythians, along with the Cimmerians, became embroiled in the developments of West Asia, and their activities would soon range from Transcaucasia to further south in Media.

Throughout the 7th century BC, it was from West Asia that the most important outside influences would arrive into the culture of the Scythians settled in Ciscaucasia, which consequently evolved into a &quot;post-Kelermes&quot; Scythian culture over the course of to . The Scythian and Cimmerian movements into Anatolia and the Iranian Plateau would act as catalysts for the adoption of Eurasian nomadic military and equestrian equipments by various West Asian states: it was during the 7th and 6th centuries BCE that &quot;Scythian-type&quot; socketed arrowheads and sigmoid bows ideal for use by mounted warriors, which were the most advanced shooting weapon of their time and were both technically and ballistically superior to native West Asian archery equipment, were adopted throughout West Asia.

Cimmerian and Scythian trading posts and settlements on the borders of the various West Asian states at this time also supplied them with goods such as animal husbandry products, not unlike the trade relations which existed the mediaeval period between the eastern steppe nomads and the Chinese Tang Empire.

With the Cimmerian victory on Urartu and Sargon II&#x27;s successful campaign there, both in 714 BC, having eliminated Urartu as a threat against the Neo-Assyrian Empire, Mannai had ceased being useful as a buffer zone for Neo-Assyrian power, while the Mannaeans started seeing the Neo-Assyrian imperial demands as an unneeded burden. Therefore, the Mannaean king Aḫšeri () welcomed the Cimmerians and the Scythians as useful allies who could offer both protection and favourable new opportunities to Mannai, which in turn allowed him to become an opponent of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, with him subsequently remaining an enemy of Sennacherib and his successors Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal.

During the period corresponding to the reign of the Neo-Assyrian king Esarhaddon (), the Scythians were active only on the western Iranian Plateau, especially in Mannai and Media, with their first ever recorded mention being from the Neo-Assyrian records of , which detail the first Scythian activities in West Asia and refer to the first recorded Scythian king, Išpakāya, as an ally of the Mannaians.

Around this time, Aḫšēri was hindering operations by the Neo-Assyrian Empire between its own territory and Mannai, while the Scythians were recorded by the Neo-Assyrians along with the eastern Cimmerians, Mannaeans and Urartians as possibly menacing communication between the Neo-Assyrian Empire and its vassal of Ḫubuškia, with messengers travelling between the Neo-Assyrian Empire and Ḫubuškia being at risk of being captured by hostile Cimmerian, Mannaean, Scythian or Urartian forces. Neo-Assyrian records also referred to joint Cimmerian-Scythian forces, along with the Medes and Mannaeans, as a possible threat against the collection of tribute from Media.

During these attacks, the Scythians, along with the eastern Cimmerians who were located on the border of Mannai, were able to reach far beyond the core territories of the Iranian Plateau and attack the Neo-Assyrian provinces of Parsuwaš and Bīt-Ḫambān and even until as far as Yašuḫ, Šamaš-naṣir and Zamuā in the valley of the Diyala river. One Scytho-Cimmerian attack which had invaded Ḫubuškia from Mannai was even able to threaten the core Neo-Assyrian territories by passing through Anisus and Ḫarrāniya on the Lower Zab river and sack the small city of Milqiya near Arbaʾil, close to the capital cities of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, where they destroyed the (House of the New Year Festival) of this city, which later had to be rebuilt by Esarhaddon. These attacks into their heartlands shocked the Assyrians, who sought to know if they were to face more such invasions through divination.

Meanwhile, Mannai, which had been able to grow in power under Aḫšēri, possibly because it adapted and incorporated steppe nomad fighting technologies borrowed from its Cimmerian and Scythian allies, was able to capture the territories including the fortresses of Šarru-iqbi and Dūr-Illil from the Neo-Assyrian Empire and retain them until the .

The Urartian king Rusa II () carried out major fortification construction projects around Lake Van, such as at Rusāipatari, and at Teišebaini near what is presently Yerevan, all intended to monitor the activities of the allied forces of the Scythians, Mannaians and Medes; other fortifications built by Rusa II were Qale Bordjy and Qale Sangar north of Lake Urmia, as well as the fortresses of Pir Chavush, Qale Gavur and Qiz Qale around the administrative centre of Haftavan Tepe to the northwest of the Lake.

These allied forces of the Cimmerians, Mannaeans and Scythians were defeated some time between and by Sennacherib&#x27;s son Esarhaddon (), who had succeeded him as the king of the Neo-Assyrian Empire and carried out a retaliatory campaign which reached deep into Median territory until Mount Bikni and the country of Patušarra (Patischoria) on the limits of the Great Salt Desert. Išpakāya was killed in battle against Esarhaddon&#x27;s forces during this campaign, and he was succeeded as king of the Scythians by Bartatua, with whom Esarhaddon might have immediately initiated negotiations.

Since the Cimmerians had left their Ciscausian homelands and moved into West Asia to seek plunder, they had no interest in the local affairs of the West Asian states and therefore fought for the highest bidder: therefore Esarhaddon took advantage of this and, at some point before , he started secret negotiations with the eastern Cimmerians, who confirmed to the Assyrians that they would remain neutral and promised not to interfere when Esarhaddon invaded Mannai again in . Nonetheless, since the Cimmerians were distant foreigners with a very different culture, and therefore did not fear the Mesopotamian gods, Esarhaddon&#x27;s diviner and advisor Bēl-ušēzib referred to these eastern Cimmerians instead of the Scythians as possible allies of the Mannaeans and advised Esarhaddon to spy on both them and the Mannaeans.

This second Assyrian invasion of Mannai however met little success because the Cimmerians with whom Esarhaddon had negotiated had deceived him by accepting his offer only to attack his invasion force, and the relations between Mannai and the Neo-Assyrian Empire remained hostile while the Cimmerians remained allied to Mannai until the period lasting from 671 to 657 BC. As a result of this failure, the Neo-Assyrian Empire resigned itself to waiting until the Cimmerians were no longer a threat before mounting any further expedition in Mannai.

From to , the eastern Cimmerians were allied with the Medes, who had rebelled against the Neo-Assyrian Empire, and with the Scythians. During these years, the Assyrian holdings in Ellipi and Paršua were constantly under threat of attack by the Cimmerians.

=====Alliance with the Neo-Assyrian Empire=====
The Neo-Assyrian Empire under Esarhaddon saw the then Kushite-ruled Egypt as its main military concern, and therefore chose to avoid spending resources on the other imperial borders by securing good relations with Tabal, Elam, Urartu, and the Median city-states.

Furthermore, the Neo-Assyrian Empire did not remain on a defensive footing in response to the activities of the allied Cimmerian, Mannaean and Scythian forces, and it soon undertook diplomatic initiatives to separate Aḫšeri from his allies: it is in this context that the Esarhaddon had opened negotiations with Išpakāya&#x27;s successor Bartatua to form friendly ties with the Scythians, and that he accepted when, by 672 BC, Bartatua had asked for the hand of the eldest daughter of Esarhaddon, the Neo-Assyrian princess Šērūʾa-ēṭirat, and promised to form an alliance treaty with the Neo-Assyrian Empire in an act of careful diplomacy.

The marriage between Bartatua and the Šērūʾa-ēṭirat likely took place: Bartatua&#x27;s marriage to Šērūʾa-ēṭirat required that he would pledge allegiance to Assyria as a vassal, and in accordance to Assyrian law, the territories ruled by him would be his fief granted by the Assyrian king, which made the Scythian presence in West Asia a nominal extension of the Neo-Assyrian Empire and Bartatua himself an Assyrian viceroy. Under this arrangement, the Scythians became one of the main political and military forces in West Asia, where their strength heavily depended on their cooperation with the Assyrian Empire: henceforth, the Scythian kingdom remained a Neo-Assyrian ally.

The result of this marriage was that the Scythians ceased to be referred to as an enemy force in the Neo-Assyrian records and the alliance between the Scythian kingdom and the Neo-Assyrian Empire was concluded, following which the Scythian kingdom remained on friendly terms with the Neo-Assyrian Empire and maintained peaceful relations with it.

Unions between Scythians and West Asians were not limited to royalty, and the appearance of jewellery decorated using granulation and filigree in the core Ciscaucasian territory of the Scythian kingdom attests that Scythian men married or took as concubines West Asian women who followed them back to Ciscaucasia.

Scythian troops appear to also have served in the Urartian army at this time, with the burial of a Scythian lord together with his horses under a Urartian building at Norşuntepe suggesting that Scythian troops were guarding the western border of Urartu under the reign of Rusa II. The earliest presence of silk West Asia was found in a Urartian fortress, presumably imported from China through the intermediary of the Scythians, implying that the trade of silk to western Eurasia might have started at this time through the intermediary of the Scythians during their stay in West Asia.

The eastern Cimmerians meanwhile remained hostile to Assyria, and, along with the Medes, were the allies of Ellipi against an invasion by the Neo-Assyrian Empire between and . The eastern Cimmerians attacked the Assyrian province of Šubria in alliance with Urartu during this time.

And when the Median ruler Kaštaritu rebelled against the Neo-Assyrian Empire and founded the first independent kingdom of the Medes after successfully liberating them from Neo-Assyrian overlordship in to , the eastern Cimmerians were allied to him.

======West Asian influences on the Scythians======
The marital alliance between the Scythian king and the Assyrian ruling dynasty, as well as the proximity of the Scythians with the Assyrian-influenced states of Mannai and Urartu, thus placed the Scythians under the strong influence of Assyrian culture, and contact with West Asian civilisation was the most important outside influence in the formation of Scythian culture and society throughout the 7th century BC:

Scythian culture and art took their definitive form to serve the interests of the Scythian aristocracy which was establishing its hegemony in West Asia over the course of to , when it absorbed various West Asian elements; Scythian dress and armour from this time, as well as the artefacts, motifs, style and technique of the grave goods used in the kurgans of the Scythian kingdom&#x27;s core territory in Ciscaucasia, all reflect heavy influences from West Asia and the Iranian Plateau on Scythian culture during this period.

Under West Asian influence, Scythian rulers started emulating the West Asian kings of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, Urartu and Media, and they began using luxury goods as status markers: the Scythians especially profited significantly in this regards from their activities in West Asia, where they obtained spoil acquired as diplomatic presents or as plunder, and which they used to enhance their status back in their kingdom&#x27;s core territory in the Ciscaucasian Steppe. The Assyrian- and Urartian-made grave goods in the Ciscaucasian Scythian kurgans thus reflected the introduction of cultural elements from West Asia in the south.

Thus, during this period, large amounts of goods, especially luxury items were flowing from West Asia into the Scythian core territories in the steppe, having been made by West Asian craftsmen for Scythian patrons, and attesting of the Caucasus Mountains&#x27; role as a porous boundary through which the Scythians could obtain desirable goods from the peoples of West Asia. Examples of these goods include a sword scabbard, an axe overlay, a pair of gold cups, a silver mirror, all of West Asian origin and found in one of the Kelermes kurgans and the kurgan, as well as Assyrian-made jewellery, such as coiled earrings, diadems decorated with rosettes and other objects decorated with stamping, granulation and filigree.

In addition to the imported West Asian luxury goods, concepts also flowed northwards from West Asia into the Ciscaucasian Steppe, where they went on to enhance the artistic range of the craftsmen serving the Scythian aristocracy: the Scythians had absorbed West Asian tastes and customs, such as the concept of the divine origin of royal power, and as their material culture was absorbing West Asian elements, so was their art absorbing West Asian artistic modes of representing these, which is visible in how some of the luxury goods available to the Scythian aristocrats combined native Scythian motifs with West Asian ones, such as through the mingling of West Asian-style and nomadic beasts and depictions of the Tree of Life on Scythian gold sword sheaths.

These luxury goods were made by West Asian craftsmen for Scythian rulers, with the gold overlays of the two swords and the axe from Kelermes and Melhuniv implying that the Scythians were then under strong Urartian artistic influence or that Urartian craftsmen were producing metalwork for Scythian patrons. Scythian chariot parts, ritual horse attire, bowls, stolls, clothing elements, personal jewellery such as diadems and earrings, especially, were borrowed from West Asians through the intermediary of West Asian craftsmen, who might have accompanied the Scythians back into their Ciscaucasian core territory, where their skills were highly prized.

It was also only when the Scythians expanded into West Asia that they became acquainted with iron smelting and forging, before which they were still a Bronze Age society until the late 8th century BC. Some West Asian blacksmiths might have accompanied the Scythians during their northwards retreat and become employed by Scythian kings. The Scythians also borrowed the use of the war chariots and of scale armour from West Asians, and Scythian warriors themselves obtained iron weapons and military experience during their stay in West Asia.
Assyrian- and Urartian-style horse equipment found in Scythian kurgans of this time also attests of the importation of West Asian horses in Ciscaucasia during the period of Scythian presence in West Asia.

Within the Scythian religion, the goddess Artimpasa and the Snake-Legged Goddess were significantly influenced by the Mesopotamian and Syro-Canaanite religions, and respectively absorbed elements from ʿAštart-Ištar-Aphrodite for Artimpasa and from ʿAttarʿattā-Derketō for the Snake-Legged Goddess. Scythian chariot parts from this period were decorated with images of the goddess Ištar stylised like those from Neo-Assyrian reliefs.

Reflecting West Asian influences on Scythian religion, a fire temple was built near the first Krasnoye Znamya kurgan according to the rules of Median fire temples, suggesting that Median builders might have moved to Ciscaucasia to build it.

====Conquest of Mannai====
Some time in the late 660s or early 650s BC, the eastern Cimmerians left the Iranian Plateau and retreated westwards into Anatolia to join the western Cimmerians operating there.

Although Mannai had been powerful under its king Aḫšeri, this power had depended on his alliance with the Cimmerians and Scythians to protect his kingdom from attacks by the Neo-Assyrian Empire, and their departure therefore provided Esarhaddon&#x27;s son and successor to the Neo-Assyrian throne, Ashurbanipal (), with the opportunity to carry out a campaign against Mannai over the course of 660 to 659 BC and recover some of the settlements which the Mannaeans had previously captured.

Aḫšeri tried in vain to stop the Neo-Assyrian advance, but he was otherwise able to withstand the Neo-Assyrian invasion. Aḫšeri had also depended on the Cimmerians to suppress internal opposition to his rule, and their absence weakened him enough that he was soon was overthrown by a popular rebellion and killed along with most of his dynasty by a peasant revolt. Aḫšeri&#x27;s surviving son, Uallî, requested help from Ashurbanipal, which was provided through the intermediary of Ashurbanipal&#x27;s brother-in-law, the Scythian king Bartatua, who annexed Mannai into the Scythian kingdom while Uallî repressed the rebellion before ascending to the throne of Mannai and submitting to the Neo-Assyrian Empire. Despite this defeat, Mannai remained a significant power until the rise of the Median Empire in the late 7th century BC.

Following the Scythian conquest of Mannai, the centre of Scythian power in West Asia shifted to the region of the Lake Urmia, between the Caspian Sea and the Zagros Mountains in the northwest of the Iranian Plateau, where the fertile pastures around the lake allowed the Scythians to rear the large herds of horses that they depended on. Henceforth, the site corresponding to present-day Saqqez became the political centre of the Scythians in West Asia.

==== The reign of Madyes ====
Bartatua was succeeded by his son with Šērūʾa-ēṭirat, Madyes, who remained an ally of the Neo-Assyrian Empire.

=====Conquest of Media=====
In 652 BC, Esarhaddon&#x27;s eldest son, Šamaš-šuma-ukin, who had succeeded him as king of Babylon, rebelled against his younger brother Ashurbanipal: it took Ashurbanipal four years to fully suppress the Babylonian rebellion by 648 BC, and another year to destroy the power of Elam, who had supported Šamaš-šuma-ukin, and, although Ashurbanipal would nevertheless be able to maintain control over Babylonia for the rest of his reign, the Neo-Assyrian Empire finally emerged from this crisis severely worn out.

By 625 BC, the Medes had acquired knowledge of new ideologies and military technologies both from the sedentary powers like the Neo-Assyrian Empire and Urartu, and from the steppe nomads like the Cimmerians and the Scythians. Thanks to the Median integration of these influences, the Median king Phraortes had been able to combine Scythian and Neo-Assyrian military practices and create an organised army composed of distinct divisions of spearmen, archers, and cavalry, thus transforming Media into the dominant power of the Iranian Plateau.

When the revolt of Babylon broke out, Phraortes supported Šamaš-šuma-ukin, and Madyes helped Ashurbanipal repress the revolt externally by invading the Medes and imposing Scythian hegemony on Media.

Under Scythian rule, the Medes adopted more Scythian weaponry and military tactics, especially in the domain of archery, and they also adopted mounted cavalry as the main form of cavalry warfare.

=====Scythian hegemony in West Asia=====
The Scythian conquest of Media itself, in turn, marked the beginning of a nearly 30-year long period of Scythian hegemony in West Asia which Graeco-Roman authors later called the &quot;Scythian rule over Upper Asia,&quot; and during which the Scythian kingdom held hegemony not only in Trauscaucasia and Mannai, but would soon extend their rule to Urartu and Anatolia as well, with the various states in these regions, such as Mannai, Urartu and Media, continuing to exist under the suzerainty of the Scythian kingdom and having to pay tribute to it.

=====Defeat of the Cimmerians=====
======Cimmerian activities in Anatolia======
During the 7th century BC, the bulk of the Cimmerians were operating in Anatolia, where they controlled a large territory bordering Lydia in the west, covering Phrygia, and reaching Cilicia and the borders of Urartu in the east.

The disturbances experienced by the Neo-Assyrian Empire as result of the activities of the Cimmerians in Anatolia led to many of the rulers of this region to try to break away from Neo-Assyrian overlordship, so that the Cimmerians had effectively ended Neo-Assyrian control in Anatolia by the time that Esarhaddon had been succeeded as king of the Neo-Assyrian Empire by Ashurbanipal. By 657 BC, Neo-Assyrian records were referring to a Cimmerian threat against the western possessions of the Neo-Assyrian Empire in the province of Que or even part of the Levant.

In 657 BC itself, the Assyrian divinatory records were calling the Cimmerian king Dugdammî (the Lygdamis of the Greek authors) by the title of (), which in the Mesopotamian worldview could belong to the King of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, and had been usurped by the Cimmerians and needed to be won back by the Neo-Assyrian Empire This situation remained unchanged throughout the rest of the 650s and the early 640s BC.

======Cimmerian alliance with the Treres======
Around the , the Thracian tribe of the Treres migrated across the Thracian Bosporus and invaded Anatolia from the north-west, after which they allied with the Cimmerians, and, from around the , the Cimmerians were nomadising in Anatolia along with the Treres.

======Cimmerian attack on Lydia and Asian Greece======

In 644 BC, the Cimmerians and Treres under the Cimmerian king Dugdammî and the Treran king Kōbos, and in alliance with the Lycians or Lycaonians, attacked Lydia for a second time in 644 BC: this time they defeated the Lydians and captured their capital city of Sardis except for its citadel, and the Lydian king Gyges died during this attack.

After sacking Sardis, Lydgamis and Kobos led the Cimmerians and the Treres into invading the Greek city-states of the Troad, Aeolia and Ionia on the western coast of Anatolia, where they destroyed the city of Magnesia on the Meander as well as the Artemision of Ephesus.

======Cimmerian activities in Cilicia======
Sensing the exhaustion of Neo-Assyrian power following the suppression of the revolt of Šamaš-šuma-ukin, the Cimmerians moved to Cilicia on the north-west border of the Neo-Assyrian Empire in itself, immediately after their third invasion of Lydia and the attack on the Asian Greek cities. There, Dugdammî allied with the then rebellious Assyrian vassal state of Tabal, Mussi, to attack the Neo-Assyrian Empire.

However, Mussi died before the planned attack on Neo-Assyrian Empire, while Dugdammî carried it out but failed because, according to Neo-Assyrian sources, fire broke out in his camp. Following this, Dugdammî was faced with a revolt against himself, after which ended his hostilities against the Neo-Assyrian Empire and sent tribute to Ashurbanipal to form an alliance with him, while Ashurbanipal forced Dugdammi to swear an oath to not attack the Neo-Assyrian Empire.

======Death of Dugdammî======
Dugdammî soon broke his oath and attacked the Neo-Assyrian Empire again, but during his military campaign he contracted a grave illness whose symptoms included paralysis of half of his body and vomiting of blood as well as gangrene of the genitals, and he consequently committed suicide in 640 BC in Ḫilakku itself.

Dugdammî was succeeded as king of the western Cimmerians in Ḫilakku by his son Sandakšatru, who continued Dugdammî&#x27;s attacks against the Neo-Assyrian Empire but failed just like his father.

======Decline of the Cimmerians======
The power of the Cimmerians dwindled quickly after the death of Dugdammî, although the Lydian kings Ardys and Sadyattes might however have either died fighting the Cimmerians or were deposed for being incapable of efficiently fighting them, respectively in and .

======Rise of the Lydian Empire======

Despite these setbacks, the Lydian kingdom was able to grow in power, and the Lydians themselves appear to have adopted Cimmerian military practices such as the use of mounted cavalry, with the Lydians fighting using long spears and archers, both on horseback.

Around , and with Neo-Assyrian approval, the Scythians under Madyes conquered Urartu, entered Central Anatolia and defeated the Cimmerians and Treres. This final defeat of the Cimmerians was carried out by the joint forces of Madyes&#x27;s Scythians, whom Strabo of Amasia credits with expelling the Treres from Asia Minor, and of the Lydians led by their king Alyattes, who was himself the son of Sadyattes as well as the grandson of Ardys and the great-grandson of Gyges, whom Herodotus of Halicarnassus and Polyaenus of Bithynia claim permanently defeated the Cimmerians so that they no longer constituted a threat.

In Polyaenus&#x27; account of the defeat of the Cimmerians, he claimed that Alyattes used &quot;war dogs&quot; to expel them from Asia Minor, with the term &quot;war dogs&quot; being a Greek folkloric reinterpretation of young Scythian warriors who, following the Indo-European passage rite of the &quot;&quot;, would ritually take on the role of wolf- or dog-warriors.

The Cimmerians completely disappeared from history following this final defeat, and they were soon assimilated by the populations of Anatolia. It was also around this time that the last still-existing Syro-Hittite and Aramaean states in Anatolia, which had been either independent or vassals of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, Phrygia, Urartu, or the Cimmerians, also finally disappeared, although the exact circumstances of their end are still very uncertain.

Scythian power in West Asia thus reached its peak under Madyes, with the West Asian territories ruled by the Scythian kingdom extending from the Halys river in Anatolia in the west to the Caspian Sea and the eastern borders of Media in the east, and from Transcaucasia in the north to the northern borders of the Neo-Assyrian Empire in the south. And, following the defeat of the Cimmerians and the disappearance of the other Anatolian states, it was the new Lydian Empire of Alyattes which became the dominant power of Anatolia.

Archaeologically, the movement of the Cimmerians and Scythians into Anatolia corresponds to the expansion of the Scythian culture into this region.

It was also at this time that the Scythians first came into contact with the Greeks, in Anatolia.

=====First wave of Greek colonisation=====
The ancient Greeks had first been making expeditions in the Black Sea in the 8th century BC, and encounters with friendly native populations quickly stimulated trade relations and the development of more regular commercial transits, which in turn led to the formation of trading settlements.

After the Greek city-states in the Aegean Sea begun to experience social tensions caused by the growth of their populations and the Cimmerian invasions of Ionia in the middle of the 7th century BC, the shores of the Black Sea became a propitious destination to establish settlements since its coasts provided safe ports, defendable locations, and plenty of fish in the seas, estuaries and rivers. Furthermore, the local population in the North Pontic region was already producing a surplus of goods such as grain, which facilitated the peaceful formation of relations with the local peoples and the early development of trade with the peoples of the forest steppe.

The main agent for the Greek colonisation of the shores of the Black Sea was the city of Miletus from Ionia in western Anatolia, who was responsible for founding around 90 colonies, and other cities of Ionia, such as Samos and Chios, were also important participants of this process.

Thus, soon after, around , the Scythians in the Pontic Steppe came into contact with Greek settlers from Miletus who were starting to found their first colonies in the areas under Scythian rule on the northern coast of the Black Sea. This process of colonisation put the Scythians&#x27; nomadic world of the steppes into permanent contact with the urban one of the Aegean Greeks for the rest of their history.

======First Greek trade outposts======
The first wave of Greek colonisation of the north coast of the Black Sea consisted of attempts to develop trade with its native populations, and therefore involved the formation of trading enclaves (; ) which had to be set up at locations providing safe approach and good docking facilities, as well as granting access to the major rivers of the steppe through which the inland regions of the forest steppe could be reached; these rivers were important in their role as the routes through which various goods could be shipped to the south to the Greek colonies. The native populations and the colonists saw this process, intended to establish trade connections in places which already had a sparse population rather than to obtain land, as mutually beneficial, hence why it was largely peaceful.

Therefore, the earliest of the north Black Sea were built at Histria on the mouth of the Istros river, at Tyras on a promontory commanding the estuary of the Tyras river, and especially on the island of Borysthenēs, near the joint estuary of the Hypanis and Borysthenēs rivers and therefore granting access to both of them. The of Borysthenēs would henceforth thrive during the rest of the 7th century BC, and throughout the following 6th century BC.

These were themselves useful for the commercial ventures of their mother cities by acting as markets through which oil, wine and manufactured goods could be exchanged with the native populations in exchange for foodstuffs and rare raw materials such as grain, fish, animal products, metals, forest products, furs, and slaves brought through the inland trading networks. The success of this trade, as a result, reinforced itself into a way for the Greek colonies we well as their home cities to increase their power and wealth.

=====Decline in West Asia=====
By the mid-620s BC, the Neo-Assyrian Empire began unravelling after the death of Ashurbanipal: in addition to internal instability within Assyrian itself due to civil wars under his successors Aššur-etil-ilāni () and Sîn-šar-iškun (), Babylon also revolted against the Assyrians in 626 BC under the leadership of Nabopolassar, and the Assyrian general Sîn-šumu-līšir also rebelled against Sîn-šar-iškun in 626 BC.

======Revolt of Media======

By then, the Median king Cyaxares had grown powerful and started negotiations with the Scythians. The next year, in 625 BC, he invited the Scythian leaders at a feast in his palace, where he made them drunk and by assassinated them all, thus overthrowing the Assyro-Scythian yoke over the Medes and making them one of the first people to acquire independence from the Neo-Assyrian Empire.

The assassination of the Scythian rulers by Cyaxares brought an end to the hegemony of the Scythian kingdom in West Asia, after which its activities became limited to the eastern borderlands of the Neo-Assyrian Empire and the importation of West Asian goods into the Scythian kingdom&#x27;s core territories of the Ciscaucasian steppe ended.

The Medes at this time had acquired knowledge of new ideologies and military technologies both from the sedentary powers like the Neo-Assyrian Empire and Urartu, and from the steppe nomads like the Cimmerians and the Scythians: it was, weapons and military tactics, particularly in archery.) Thanks to the Median integration of these influences, Cyaxares was able to combine Scythian and Neo-Assyrian military practices and create an organised army composed of distinct divisions of spearmen, archers, and cavalry, thus transforming Media into the dominant power of the Iranian Plateau again like Phraortes had done before.

Following the successful revolts of Babylonia under Nabopolassar and Media under Cyaxares, the various vassals of the Neo-Assyrian Empire in Anatolia and on the Iranian Plateau started breaking away from Neo-Assyrian rule.

======Raid into the Levant======

With the power of their former Neo-Assyrian allies crumbling during the mid-620s BC, and the newly ascending Neo-Babylonian and Median empires having not yet consolidated themselves, the Scythians took advantage of the power vacuum to raid into the Levant some time between and . It is unknown whether this raid damaged the hold of the Neo-Assyrian Empire on its western provinces, although the last known Neo-Assyrian presence in Phoenicia dates from around this time, in the form of the mention of the governor of Ṣumur, Mannu-kī-aḫḫē, in a list of eponyms from .

The Scythian raid into the Levant reached as far south as Palestine, and was foretold by the Judahite prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah and Zephaniah, who foretold of a pending &quot;Disaster from the North&quot; which they believed would result in the destruction of Jerusalem. However, the Scythian raid did not affect Jerusalem or even the kingdom of Judah, which caused Jeremiah to lose favour with the Judahite king Josiah, who instead turned to the prophetess Huldah for counsel, and led to Jeremiah temporarily stopping prophesying for some years.

The Scythian raid reached the borders of the Saite Egyptian kingdom, where their advance was stopped by the marshes of the Nile Delta, after which the pharaoh Psamtik I met them and convinced them to turn back by offering them gifts.

The Scythians sacked several cities in Palestine while retreating, including the temple of the goddess ʿAštart in Ascalon. According to later Graeco-Roman authors, this the shrine of Ascalon was considered to be the most ancient of all temples to that goddess, as a result of which the perpetrators of this sacrilege and their descendants were allegedly cursed by ʿAštart with a &quot;female disease&quot; causing them to become a class of transvestite diviners called the  ( in Scythian).

=====War against the Neo-Assyrian Empire=====
Having reorganised his kingdom and grown his military power, Cyaxares attacked the Neo-Assyrian Empire; meanwhile, Nabopolassar had managed to take control of all Babylonia by 620 BC, and by 616 BC he was militarily comfortable enough to attack the Assyrian core territories; and Nabopolassar and Cyaxares soon allied with each other against the Neo-Assyrian Empire.

By 615, the Scythian kingdom was operating as an ally of Cyaxares in his war against the Neo-Assyrian Empire, possibly out of necessity, with the Scythians&#x27; abandonment of their former alliance with the Assyrians to instead side with the Neo-Babylonians and the Medes being a critical factor in worsening the military position of the Neo-Assyrian Empire. The Scythian kingdom supported the Medo-Babylonian conquests of Aššur in 614 BC, of Nineveh in 612 BC, and of the last Neo-Assyrian remnants at Ḫarran in 610 BC, which permanently destroyed the Neo-Assyrian Empire.

The presence of Scythian-style arrowheads at locations where the Neo-Babylonian Empire is known to have conducted military campaigns, and which are associated with the destruction layers of these campaigns, suggests that certain contingents composed of Scythians or of Medes who had adopted Scythian archery techniques might have recruited by the Neo-Babylonian army during this war. The Neo-Babylonian archery divisions themselves were influenced Scythian archery techniques because Scythian bows were more powerful than Akkadian ones.

Clay figurines depicting Scythian riders, as well as an Ionian shield and a Neo-Hittite battle-axe similar to those found in Scythian remains in the Pontic steppe, suggest that both the contingents as well as actual Scythian mercenaries had also participated at the final Neo-Babylonian victory over the Egyptians at Carchemish.

The Scythian or Scythian-style contingents also participated in the Neo-Babylonian campaigns in the southern Levant, including in the Babylonian annexation of the kingdom of Judah in 586 BC.

===== Beginning of Graeco-Scythian commercial activities =====
From the Greek settlements on the Black Sea coast, the Scythian aristocracy especially bought luxury goods which they used flauntingly during their lives and in their tombs as status markers: wine and the various Greek vessels used to mix and drink it were especially imported in large quantities and were even used as grave goods, while craftsmen in the Greek colonies manufactured items made of gold or electrum for Scythian patrons.

Once Scythian activities begun to decline in West Asia in the and ties between the Scythians and the Greek colonies started developing concurrently, the Scythians started buying Greek pottery imported from the Aegean islands, and a new thriving source of trade for the Scythian kingdom was created in the north shore of the Black Sea. Thus ended the importation into the Scythian kingdom&#x27;s core territories of the Ciscaucasian steppe of West Asian goods, which were replaced by goods bought from the Greek colonies or commissioned from Greek craftsmen by Scythian patrons over the course of to , thus resulting in Greek influences on the Scythians replacing West Asian ones from the beginning of the 6th century BC.

The relations between the Scythian kingdom and the Greek colonies of the northern Pontic region therefore remained initially largely peaceful, thanks to which the Greek cities possessed no defensive walls.

=====Expulsion from West Asia=====
By the , the ascending Median Empire of Cyaxares annexed Urartu, after having already annexed Mannai in 616 BC. This rise of Median power forced the Scythian kingdom to leave West Asia and retreat northward into the Ciscaucasian Steppe, after which the Scythian activities in West Asia, as well as the ties between West Asians and the Scythians over the course of the 7th century BC, and West Asian influences on the Scythians, all came to an end around .

Nevertheless, even after the Scythians&#x27; retreat from West Asia, complex relations continued to exist between the Median and Scythian kingdoms located, respectively, to the south and north of the Caucasus Mountains, with the Scythians continuing to be involved as partners and enemies of the Median kingdom in the Caucasian region.

======Remnants in West Asia======
Some splinter Scythian groups nevertheless remained in eastern Transcaucasia, especially in the area corresponding to modern-day Azerbaijan, and did not retreat to the north. Therefore, the area where they lived was called () by the Medes; this name was later recorded as  () by Ptolemy, and its inhabitants were called the () by Xenophon, as () by Arrian, and as the by Titus Livius.

These Scythians served in the army of Cyaxares, where they participated in the Median conquest of Urartu, and it was one such Scythian division was responsible for the capture and destruction of the fortresses of Argištiḫinili and Teišebaini in northern Urartu. The Median kingdom might also have employed Scythians as hunters to provide the court with game.

Hostilities eventually broke out between Cyaxares and some of these Scythians serving him, likely as a result of the Median kingdom ending the autonomy of these Scythians and fully annexing them. Later Graeco-Roman sources claimed that these Scythians left the Median kingdom and fled into the Lydian Empire, beginning a conflict between Lydia and Media: in the first two decades of the 6th century BC, the Median westwards expansion from the Iranian Plateau and the Lydian eastwards expansion from Anatolia came to blows, resulting in a war which lasted from and ended only due to a solar eclipse in 585 BC, after which peace was made between Lydia and Media and a new political order was established in West Asia.

These Scythians who had remained in West Asia had been completely assimilated into Median society and state by the mid-6th century BC so that they no longer constituted an independent group and no longer had a separate identity of their own.

====North Pontic Scythian kingdom====

After their expulsion from West Asia, the majority of the Scythians returned to the parts of the Ciscaucasian Steppe corresponding to present-day Stavropol and the Kuban river valley before moving into the Pontic Steppe, which only then started being occupied by the Scythians in bulk and on a large scale, resulting in the Pontic Steppe becoming the centre of Scythian power. Among the Scythians who had still remained in Ciscaucasia, the influence of the native populations of this region became more prominent during this period.

This movement of the Scythians into the Pontic Steppe was motivated by two main factors:
*to the south of the Caucasus was the powerful but hostile Median Empire, which compromised the security of the Scythian realm in Ciscaucasia;
*the Greek colonies on the shores of the Black Sea to the south and the mixed farmers of the forest steppe to the north essential source of trade for the Scythians, thus being a place from where they could obtain significant wealth.
The Scythian settlement in the Pontic Steppe had thus placed them in an extremely advantageous position:
*to the north, in the forest steppe, lived large settled mixed farmer populations who produced a large variety of highly sought-after commodities such as iron, charcoal, furs, honey, slaves, and grain;
*to the south, on the north shore of the Black Sea, were the Greek colonies which were seeking raw materials and manpower for their own use, as well as to export to Greece.
This situation therefore allowed the Scythian kingdom to mediate the thriving trade that the Greek colonies to their south were carrying out with the sedentary peoples of the forest steppe to their north, and which was carried out via the large rivers of the Scythian steppe flowing southwards into the Black Sea and formed the main access routes to these northern markets. The relations between the Scythian kingdom and the Greek traders were therefore mutually beneficial and influenced both the nomadic Scythians and the forest steppe populations, with the Scythian aristocracy profiting significantly from this trade.

The Pontic Steppe was therefore a particularly attractive territory for the Scythians to occupy, not only because it was an ideal terrain for their warrior pastoralist lifestyle, but also because it allowed them to obtain grain to supplement their diet from the mixed farmer population of the forest steppe to their north, and exotic luxury goods for their aristocracy to use as status markers from the Greek colonies on the shore of the Black Sea.

Attesting of this Scythian movement out of Ciscaucasia and into the Pontic Steppe, as well as of their deepening of the connections with the Greek colonies, Ciscaucasian helmets ceased to be used by the Scythians in the 6th century BC, and were replaced by Greek ones, especially of the Attic type, while the female burial of the 2nd Kelermes kurgan contained an Ionian Greek silver gilt mirror made in the 7th to 6th centuries BC.

=====Pontic Scythian political and social formation=====
Within the Pontic Steppe, the incoming Iranic Scythians settled in the eastern steppe regions on the western and eastern banks of the Hypanis and Borysthenēs rivers and immediately to the north of the Maeotian Sea eastwards until the Tanais river, while in the western parts of the Scythian kingdom lived several Thracian and Proto-Slavic sedentary tribes: the arriving Scythian conquerors established themselves as the ruling elite, known as the Royal Scythians, over the local population and assimilated them into a single tribal identity while allowing them to continue their various lifestyles and economic organisations.

Thus, in many parts of the north Pontic region under their rule, the Scythians established themselves as a ruling class over already present sedentary Thracian populations in the western regions: some of the Scythian tribes intermarried with the already present sedentary Thracian populations to form new tribes such as the Nomadic Scythians and the Alazones, composed of a Thracian populace with an Iranic ruling class. The Royal Scythians&#x27; ability to dominate these sedentary populations was itself derived from their nomadic military methods which they had first developed in Ciscaucasia. Therefore, many of the ethnically non-Scythian populations of the Pontic Steppe became designated by the term &quot;&quot; largely because they lived under the domination of the Scythians proper, after whom the Pontic Steppe also became known as .

During this early phase of the Pontic Scythian kingdom, the Royal Scythians settled in the region immediately to the west of the Tanais river, with their hold on the western part of the steppe located to the west of the Borysthenēs being light, and they were largely satisfied with tribute they levied from the sedentary agriculturist populations of this region.

In the Tauric Chersonese, where lived the Tauri, the Royal Scythians conquered the members of this population living in the foothills and the steppes, thus gaining control of mist of the peninsula and forming a mixed Scythi-Taurian population. Due to this mingling with the Scythians, the sites of the Taurian Kizil-Koba culture in the foothill steppes were different from those in the Tauric Mountains who remained independent of the Scythians. During the 6th century BC, the Scythians were few in number in the Tauric Chersonese, and, because they led a nomadic life, their population on the peninsula increased only during the seasonal migrations.

From the 7th to 5th centuries BC, the Scythian kingdom was a pre-state tribal class society constituted of tribes headed by their own lords, with the king being the main tribal lord of the dominant tribe of the incoming Iranic Scythians, known as the Royal Scythians, and all the other tribes within the Scythian kingdom being subject to the Royal Scythians, to whose king and warrior aristocracy they had to provide servants to.

The metallurgical workshops which produced the weapons and horse harnesses of the Scythians during the Early Scythian period were located in the forest steppe, with the centre of industry at that time being located in the region of the Tiasmyn group of the Scythian culture, which corresponded the country of the Arotēres, where an Iranic Scythian elite ruled over a sedentary Thracian population.

During this early phase of their northern Pontic kingdom, in the 6th to 5th centuries BC, the Scythian royalty would bury their dead in two main regions:
* in Ciscaucasia in the Kuban region inhabited by the Maeotians, where the royal and aristocratic tombs were the most lavish of all Scythian funerary monuments of the Early Scythian period, and included the kurgans of Kelermesskaya, Ulsky Aul, and Kostromskaya Stanitsa. The burials in these kurgans consisted either of rectangular or square pits covered with wood, or of wooden or stone vaults built on the ground surface, in which the deceased were laid out in supine position, accompanied by riding horses, as well as draught horses accompanied by chariots and several objects of West Asian origin;
* in the forest steppe, where the tombs were built using a slightly different rite than the Ciscaucasian ones: they consisted of pits covered with wood or wooden vaults built on the ground surface or let into pits, with the vaults having occasionally been burnt before being covered by the earthen mound. Of these, the most important was the Melhuniv kurgan, which contained grave goods of West Asian origin comparable to those of the Ciscaucasian tombs.
Only a very small number, about 20, of Scythian tombs from the 6th to 5th centuries BC were in the Pontic Steppe: these burial patterns followed a custom whereby the Scythian royalty buried their dead at the edges of their territory so as to mark the boundaries of their kingdom.

=====Scythian influence in the Pontic Steppe=====
The westward migration of the Scythians was accompanied by the introduction into the north Pontic region of articles originating in the Siberian Karasuk culture, such as distinctive swords and daggers, and which were characteristic of Early Scythian archaeological culture, consisting of cast bronze cauldrons, daggers, swords, and horse harnesses, which had themselves been influenced by Chinese art, with, for example, the &quot;cruciform tubes&quot; used to fix strap-crossings being of types which had initially been modelled by Shang artisans.

It was at this time that the Scythians brought the knowledge of working iron which they had acquired in West Asia with them and introduced it into the Pontic Steppe, whose peoples were still Bronze Age societies until then. Some West Asian blacksmiths might also have accompanied the Scythians during their nortwards retreat and become employed by Scythian kings, after which the practice of ironworking soon spread to the neighbouring populations.

The Scythian establishment in the Pontic Steppe, and therefore their subduing of the native populations of this region, was especially facilitated by the iron weapons and the military experience they had obtained in West Asia. Introduced into the Pontic Steppe during this period by the Scythians was the use of scale armour, which the Royal Scythian aristocracy had themselves borrowed from the West Asian peoples.

=====Expansion into Central Europe=====
======Migration of the Sindi======
As part of the Scythians&#x27; expansion into Europe, a section of the Scythian tribe of the Sindi left the region of the Maeotian Sea and, over the course of the 7th to 6th centuries BC, migrated westwards into the eastern section of the Pannonian Steppe, where they settled alongside the Sigynnae.

The majority of the Sindi instead remained in Ciscaucasia, where they settled on the peninsula which came to be known as the Sindic Chersonese () after them, and where they formed a ruling class over the native Maeotians, who were themselves of native Caucasian origin.

======In the forest steppe======
The presence of Scythian aristocratic burials in the forest steppe suggests that the Scythian kingdom in the 6th BC century was still continuing its policy of trying to establish its authority on the native populations of the forest steppe, as also attested by the how these latter populations were still building fortified settlements to defend themselves from Scythian attacks.

The Scythians were able to expand their hegemony into part of the forest steppe situated to the east of the Borysthenēs river over the course of the late 7th and early 6th centuries BC, soon after the end of their activities in West Asia, but they were only starting to enter the parts of the forest steppe to the west of the Borysthenēs at this time.

Once the Royal Scythians had moved from Ciscaucasia into the Pontic Steppe in the late 7th century BC and they had subjugated the eastern forest steppe, they collaborated closely with the ruling elites of the forest steppe tribes. During the 6th century BC, this dependancy of the forest steppe sedentary population consisted of tribute-offering, in exchange of which the Scythians would avoid launching military raids against them and would let the local rulers preserve their political organisation and preside over the production of agricultural produce to be given as tribute to the Scythians.

======Raids to the west======
Once the centre of Scythian power had shifted into the Pontic Steppe, from around the Scythians often raided into the adjacent regions, with Central and Southeast Europe being a frequent target of their attacks. Attacks by the Scythians were directed not only at Transylvania, Podolia and the Pannonian Steppe, but might also have been directed at southern Germania, where they attacked the Lusatian culture and caused its destruction, and from there, until as far as Gaul, and possibly even the Iberian peninsula: these Scythian incursions were not unlike those of the Huns and the Avars during the Migration Period, and of the Mongols in the mediaeval era, and were recorded in Etruscan bronze figurines depicting mounted Scythian archers.

Multiple settlements of the Lusatian culture were destroyed by Scythian attacks during this period, and Scythian arrowheads have been found at several sites located in what are present-day Poland and Slovakia, such as at Witaszkowo, , Strzegom, , and . The Scythians also attacked, sacked and destroyed many of the wealthy and important Iron Age settlements located to the north and south of the Moravian Gate and belonging to the eastern group of the Hallstatt culture, including that of Smolenice-Molpír, where Scythian-type arrows were found at this fortified hillfort&#x27;s access points at the gate and the south-west side of the acropolis

======Westwards Scythian influences======
Due to these Scythian incursions, new early Scythian-type objects originating from the steppes, consisting of Scythian-type weapons and horse-equipment, as well as remains associated with the early Scythians, started appearing from this time in Central Europe especially in Bessarabia, Transylvania, the Thracian and Pannonian plains, and what is presently Slovakia. Trade and the migration of some Scythian splinter groups into the Pannonian Basin also contributed to the appearance of these Scythian-type objects there.

Some of the populations of the Lusatian culture, as well as the eastern groups of the Hallstatt culture, might also have been influenced by the Scythians and therefore borrowed weapon and horse harness types from them: interactions with the Scythians led to the adoption of the Scythian-type &quot;Animal Style&quot; art and mounted archery by the population of these regions in the subsequent period. It was also at this time that the Scythians introduced metalwork types which followed Shang Chinese models into Western Eurasia, where they were adopted by the Hallstatt culture. Scythian artistic influences were also absorbed by Celtic art at this time.

Trade between the Pontic Scythian kingdom and the nomads of the Pannonian Basin as well as the migration of splinter Scythian groups there contributed to the transformation of the culture of these peoples into a more Scythian-like form. Among the populations influenced were the Agathyrsi of Transylvania and the Sigynnae of the north and northwest Pannonian Basin: after the Sigynnae had settled into the Pannonian Steppe in the 8th century BC, their originally Chernogorovka-Novocherkassk culture evolved into the Mezőcsát group, which itself evolved into the Vekerzug culture after coming under Scythian influence.

=====Second wave of Greek colonisation=====
The establishment of the Pontic Scythian kingdom was a catalyst for the development of extensive trade connections, and it was only after the bulk of the Scythians had moved into the Pontic Steppe that more permanent Greek colonies were founded in this region: the second wave of Greek colonisation of the north coast of the Black Sea, which started soon after , involved the formation of settlements possessing agricultural lands () for migrants from Miletus, Corinth, Phocaea and Megara seeking to establishing themselves to farm () in these regions where the land was fertile and the sea was plentiful.

The relations between the Scythian kingdom and the Greek colonies of the northern Pontic region were therefore initially largely peaceful, owing to which the Greek cities possessed no defensive walls and were surrounded by unfortified rural in which were produced the grain that was consumed in the cities or exported. The prosperity of these new Greek cities depended more on the agricultural production of their than on trade transiting through them being largely located on the coasts of the Tauric Chersonese.

However, the areas most especially favoured by this wave of colonisation were the Trachean and Sindic Chersoneses, which not only controlled the passage through the Cimmerian Bosporus linking the Black Sea to the Maeotian Sea and therefore also provided access to the rivers flowing into it, but also because of the large numbers of fish thriving in the nutrient-rich waters of the Maeotian Sea. The Cimmerian Bosporus was thus so particularly attractive for the Greek settlers that about nine new colonies were founded on both the Trachean and Sindic Chersoneses over the course of to , including on the Maeotian Sea near the estuary of the Tanais river, and later at Pantikapaion, followed by more places, so that about a dozen Greek colonies were soon located around the Cimmerian Bosporus. All of these colonies on the Cimmerian Bosporus were port cities, with the settlement of Pantikapaion, which directly overlooked the strait, being the most important of them.

Among these Greek colonies, the most prominent ones would be Pontic Olbia, which served the demands of the Scythian aristocracy of the Borysthenēs river valley, and Pantikapaion, who supplied the Scythian aristocrats in the Tauric and Sindic Chersoneses.

Pontic Olbia was one of the most important cities founded during this second wave of colonisation, and was located on the mainland next to the of Borysthenēs. The itself was soon moved to Olbia due to the poor quality of the port facilities of the island of Borysthenēs, leading to Olbia soon overshadowing the colony Borysthenēs to instead itself become an important cultural and commercial centre.

In the Pontic Steppe, the Greek colonists also found appealing opportunities to trade with the Scythians by selling them wine, olive oil, textiles, metal vessels, high quality ceramic, and luxury goods in exchange for furs, raw materials, fish, animal products, slaves, and grains: Pontic Olbia especially supplied the Scythians with luxury goods such as personal ornaments, gold and silver vases, glyptic, wine, and oil, as well as defensive and offensive weapons produced in workshops located in Olbia itself or imported from mainland Greece. Olbia&#x27;s main commercial partner in Greece during this period was the city-state of Athens; during the 6th century BC Olbia was also importing large amounts of painted ware from Rhodes, Samos, Corinth, and Ionia, as well as wine in amphorae from Chios and Thasos, and bronze objects such as tools and mirrors, which were all sold to the Scythians, who especially bought Corinthian and Athenian pottery.

An important gold trade route also connected Pontic Olbia with the inland areas, running north into the territory of the tribe of the Arotēres, and from there leading into inner Asia: the Greek cities were able to grow and thrive quickly because they had been able to develop extensive trade relations with distant regions thanks to the rule of the Scythian kingdom over the Pontic Steppe and of its kings&#x27; establishment of a which ensured that traders were safe from robbers. This thriving trade route in turn was an important source of profits for the Scythian royalty and aristocracy thanks to which they obtained significant wealth. The relations between the Scythian kingdom and the Greek traders were therefore mutually beneficial and influenced both the nomadic Scythians and the forest steppe populations, with the Scythian aristocracy profiting significantly from this trade.

Olbia especially maintained friendly relations with the surrounding populations at this time, especially with the Arotēres, with whom it had close connections.

Another factor which forced the Greek colonists to maintained friendly commercial, economic and political relations with the Scythians was the fear of possible Scythian attacks, in which case the Greek fortifications would not be able to withstand the attacks of the strong and large Scythian army. Therefore, the Greeks of the Pontic coast sent rich gifts to the Scythian kings and petty lords as tribute in exchange of their neutrality or even support. Scythian aristocracy reciprocated the Greek cities&#x27; amicable attitude by adopting the same friendly policy towards the Greek cities.

The contacts between the Scythians and the Greeks led to the formation of a mixed Graeco-Scythian culture, such as among the &quot;Hellenised Scythian&quot; tribe of the Callipidae, the Histrians, the Geloni to the north of Scythia, and the Hellenised populations in and around Crimea.

=====Rise of the Persian Empire=====
Meanwhile, in West Asia, the Median, Lydian, and Neo-Babylonian empires which the Scythians had interacted with during their stay to the south of the Caucasus Mountains had been replaced over the period of to by the Achaemenid Empire, founded by Cyrus II, the king of the Persians, who were a West Asian Iranic people distantly related to the Scythians.

The society of the Achaemenid Empire under Cyrus II and his earlier successors at this time still preserved many aspects of the earlier common Iranic culture which they shared in common with the Scythians.

The formation of the Persian Achaemenid Empire constituted a further pressure from the south which forced the Scythians to remain to the north of the Caucasus and of the Black Sea. Like during the 8th to 7th centuries BC, however, influences from Achaemenid-ruled West Asia would flow northwards across the Caucasus Mountains and would influence Scythian culture.

=====Third wave of Greek colonisation=====
In , Cyrus II had conquered the Lydian Empire and brought Anatolia under the rule of his newly founded Persian Achaemenid Empire, consequently setting in march a large outflow of Greek refugees fleeing the Persian conquest, of whom many fled to the north coast of the Black Sea, thus in turn starting a third wave of Greek colonisation of this region, lasting from around until .
Although the Greek cities of the Aegean Sea were still founding new colonies throughout all the coasts of the Black Sea, some of the already existing colonies were also starting to set up their own colonies, leading to the growth of the Greek migrant population in all of these settlements. This third wave of colonisation was complex, as attested by how the settlement of Chersonesus in the Tauric Chersonese was founded in the later 6th century BC, but would later be re-settled by colonists from Pontic Heracleia in the 5th century BC.

The importance of the Greek colonies of the north Black Sea coast drastically increased following the Persian Achaemenid Empire&#x27;s conquest of Egypt in 525 BC by Cambyses II, son of Cyrus II, which deprived the states of Greece proper of the Egyptian grain that they depended on.

These grain supplies were so important to the city-states of Greece, most especially of the then dominant Greek power of Athens, that this latter city started seeking new locations for producing grain on the north shore of the Black Sea. Therefore, Athens established very well defended new colonies on the north Black Sea coast near the already existing settlements, including Nymphaion near Pantikapaion, Athēnaion near Theodosia, and Stratokleia near Phanagoreia, which would act as sites where grain of very good quality was produced to be exported to Athens to feed its citizenry.

The various Greek city-states of the Aegean Sea also imported fish, furs and slaves from Scythia during this period, and in the mid-6th century BC the Greeks started employing Scythian mercenaries in the form of detachments of mounted archers to support their own hoplite armies.

The relations between the Greeks and the Scythians continued remaining largely peaceful during the later 6th century BC, although the only Greek colony in the region of the lower Tanais river, Krēmnoi, was destroyed by the Scythians between and , and Pantikapaion might have been destroyed by the Scythians around .

=====First wave of Sauromatian immigration=====
To the east of the Scythian kingdom across the Tanais lived the Sauromatians, who were an Iranic tribe closely related to the Scythians, and who were organised into a single tribal confederation. This Sauromatian kingdom maintained good relations with the Scythian kingdom throughout its existence, from the 6th to 4th centuries BC, thanks to which there existed a trade route starting in Scythia and reaching eastwards through the territory of the Sauromatians, with Scythian art in the middle Tanais river region exhibiting influences from the Sauromatian culture and, to a lesser degree, from the Ananyino culture.

However, in the period from to , the various Sauromatian communities living from the region stretching from the Ural Mountains to the Caspian Steppe came pressure from the Massagetae of Central Asia as a result of the campaigns of Cyrus II against this latter people. Due to these pressures, the Sauromatians from the territory of the Araxes Steppe in the east over the course of the 6th century BC took over the control of Ciscaucasia from the Scythian kingdom, beginning with the territory to the east of the river Laba, and then the whole Kuban valley.

By the end of the 6th century BC, the Scythians had lost their territories in the Kuban Steppe to the Sauromatians, and the Scythian earthworks in this region were abandoned, except for those in its westernmost part which included the Sindic Chersonese, where the Scythian Sindi tribe formed a ruling class over the native Maeotians independently of the bulk of the Scythians in the Pontic Steppe, due to which this country was named Sindica. By the 5th century BC, the Scythians had completely retreated from Ciscaucasia, and Sindica was the only part of this region where the Scythian culture still survived.

This process resulted in a wave of Sauromatian nomads crossing the Tanais river, immigrating into Scythia, settling near the Royal Scythians in the region of the Maeotian Sea on the right bank of the Tanais up to the Borysthenēs, and intermarrying with the local nomad inhabitants of the Pontic Steppe. The arrival of this wave of Sauromatian immigration destroyed several settlements in the river valleys of the Borysthenēs and of the other rivers of Scythia, and it might possibly have caused the replacement of the older Scythian ruling dynasty of Spargapeithes by a new one, founded by Ariapeithes.

Introduced in Scythia by the Sauromatian immigrants in the late 6th century BC was a new funerary rite, where the deceased were inhumated in &quot;catacombs&quot; made of one or more burial chambers branching from a vertical entrance well. These &quot;catacomb&quot; burials would become more commonly used for aristocratic burials in the 5th and 4th centuries BC. Scythian art from soon after this time also reflected influences from Central Asian and Siberian tradition.

This Sauromatian immigration also introduced new social norms into Scythia thanks to which women were now allowed to become warriors. Thus, the graves of Scythian women from this period and later contained the burials of armed women, mostly belonging to ordinary nomads, and more rarely to richer nomads, with 37% of Scythian women&#x27;s burials containing the graves of armed women. The grave goods of these tombs reflected influences from the east, such as bronze daggers characteristic of the Tagar culture, as well as human individuals with East Asian features, and one deceased woman was buried in a grave whose location corresponds to present-day Novosilka near Lypovets along with a Central Asian camel.

=====Anacharsis=====
The famous Scythian sage Anacharsis came from the Scythian royal dynasty in the 6th century BC, being the brother of the then reigning king Sauaios, and both Anacharsis and Sauaios being the sons of the preceding Scythian king Gnouros.

Some time in the late 6th century BC, Anacharsis left Scythia to travel to Greece, where he became respected enough as a skilled philosopher that he was granted Athenian citizenship. According to Herodotus of Halicarnassus, Anacharsis was shot with an arrow by his brother the king Sauaios as punishment for having performed a sacrifice to the Mother of the Gods in the wooded country of Hylaia, where was located an altar to this goddess.

Although much regarding the historicity of Anacharsis is uncertain, he later became popular in ancient Greek literature, in which he appeared as a sort of &quot;man of Nature&quot; and &quot;noble savage&quot; incarnating &quot;Barbarian wisdom,&quot; after which he especially a favourite figure of the Cynics.

At this time, the Scythians were ruled by a triple-monarchy, with the names of the kings Skōpasis, Taxakis, and Sauaios&#x27;s son Idanthyrsus, being recorded for the late 6th century BC.

=====The Persian invasion=====

In the late 6th century BC, the Achaemenid Persian Empire started expanding into Europe, beginning with the Persian annexation of all of Thrace, after which the Achaemenid king of kings Darius I crossed the Istros river in 513 BC and attacked the Scythian kingdom with an army of 700,000 to 800,000 soldiers, possibly with the goal of annexing it.

In response, the Scythian king Idanthyrsus summoned the kings of the peoples surrounding his kingdom to a council to decide how to deal with the Persian invasion. The Budini, Geloni and Sauromatians joined the Scythian-led alliance in resisting the Persian invasion, and Idanthyrsus led the joint forces of the Scythians and their allied neighbours in resisting the Persian invasion. Meanwhile, the Agathyrsi, Androphagi, Melanchlaeni, Neuri and Tauri refused to support the Scythians.

According to Herodotus of Halicarnassus, the Scythian-led alliance&#x27;s strategy was to adopt the tactic of retreating before the Persian army and staying one day&#x27;s march ahead of them instead of directly fighting them, while also employing scorched earth tactics so as to goad the Persian army deeper into the deserted parts of Scythian territory. The Persian army eventually crossed the Tanais river and built fortifications there, but the Scythians continued their tactics until the Persian army was no longer at a safe distance from the Istros, allowing the Scythians to launch guerrilla attacks on it.

The results of this campaign are unclear, with Darius I himself claiming that he had conquered the (), that is the Pontic Scythians, while the ancient Greek literary tradition, following the account of Herodotus of Halicarnassus, claimed that the Persian campaign had been defeated by the Scythians, due to which the Greeks started perceiving the Scythians as being invincible thanks to their nomadic lifestyle: Herodotus&#x27;s narrative is itself considered dubious by modern historians, and his account of the failure of Darius appears to have been extremely exaggerated. Some form of Achaemenid authority might have been established in Pontic Scythia as a result of this campaign without it having been annexed.

According to Herodotus, soon after the Persian invasion, the Scythians sent a diplomatic mission to Sparta in Greece with the goal of establishing a military alliance against Darius I. Herodotus claims that, as a result of this embassy, the Spartans started drinking undiluted wine, which they called the &quot;Scythian fashion&quot; of drinking wine. The planned attack against the Achaemenid Empire however never happened.

===Middle (or Classical) period===
The retreat of the Scythians from Ciscaucasia and the arrival of the Sauromatian incomers into the Pontic Steppe in the late 6th century BC caused significant cultural changes in Scythia, giving rise to the Middle or Classical Scythian period, which itself was a hybrid culture originating from a combination of a continuation of the material culture reflected in the Ciscaucasian Scythian burials with Sauromatian elements.

Among the changes in Scythia in this period was a significant increase in the number of monumental burials: it was from the Middle Scythian period that the largest number of Scythian burials in the Pontic Steppe were made, with the Scythian upper classes starting to bury their dead within the Pontic Steppe itself largely in the region of the rapids of the Borysthenēs river (possibly the country of mentioned by Herodotus), although some aristocratic burials were also located in the forest steppes. These burials, which included horse sacrifices, were continuations of the Ciscaucasian burial traditions. Scythian burials from this period include:
*some significant sites in the region of the Borysthenēs river rapids, such as the , the 1st barrow of the Zavadska Mohyla, the 5th barrow of the , Baby mohyla, and ;
*some in the Tauric Chersonese, such as the and .

====Consolidation====
As a result of the arrival of the Sauromatian incomers, and due to the need to resist Persian encroachment, the Scythian kingdom underwent political consolidation in the early 5th century BC, during which it underwent the most significant of its economic, political, social, and cultural development by completing its evolution from a tribal confederation into an early state polity capable of dealing with the polities threatening or trading with it in an effective way; during this period, the Scythian kings increased their power and wealth by concentrating economic power under their authority.

It was also during this period that the control of the Scythians over the western part of their kingdom became heavier and more coercive with respect to the sedentary agricultural peoples living to the west of the Borysthenēs.

=====Expansionism=====
A consequence of this consolidation of the Scythian kingdom was an increase in its expansionism and militarism.

======In Thrace======
In the west, nearby Thrace became a target of Scythian expansion following the complete Achaemenid retreat from Europe, with the Scythians coming into conflict with the various Thracian peoples during the 5th century BC, and gaining free access of the Wallachian and Moldavian Steppes while also establishing a presence to the south of the Istros river, around Kallatis and Dionysopolis.

In 496 BC, the Scythians launched a raid until as far south as the Thracian Chersonese on the Hellespont.

The Scythians&#x27; inroads in Thrace were however soon stopped by the emergence of the Odrysian kingdom in this region, following which the Scythian and Odrysian kingdoms mutually established the Istros as their common border after concluding friendly and mutually advantageous relations with each other some time around : from then on, the contacts between the Scythians and Thracians deepened, with each borrowing from the other&#x27;s art and lifestyle; marriage between the Scythian and Odrysian aristocracies were also concluded, including between their respective royal dynasties, with the Scythian king Ariapeithes marrying a daughter of the Odrysian kingdom&#x27;s founding king Tērēs I some time between and .

At some point between and , Ariapeithes was killed by the Agathyrsian king Spargapeithes, after which he was succeeded as king by his son Scyles, whose mother was a Greek woman from Histria.

======In Sindica======
To the southeast, the Scythians came into conflict with their splinter tribe of the Sindi, with whom they fought by crossing the frozen Cimmerian Bosporus during the winter.

======In the forest steppe======
A second direction where the Scythian kingdom expanded was in the north and north-west: the Scythian kingdom had continued its attempts to impose its rule on the forest steppe peoples throughout the 7th and 6th centuries BC, and by the 5th century BC, it was finally able to complete the process of subjugating the groups of these populations living to the west of the Borysthenēs after destroying their fortified settlements, which were subsequently abandoned.

With the completion of the subjugation of the forest steppe by the Scythians, the various ethnic groups inhabiting this region interacted to the point that their cultures fused with that of the Scythians, leading to the originally Scythian-type burials in kurgans which had originated in Ciscaucasia becoming widespread among the forest steppe populations.

During the 5th century BC, Scythian rule over the forest steppe people became increadingly dominating and coercive, leading to a decline of their sedentary agrarian lifestyle, especially in the region of the right bank of the Borysthenēs, where their settlements disintegrated and became fewer in number. This in turn resulted in a reduction in the importation of Greek goods by the peoples of the forest steppe in the 5th century BC.

The presence of Scythian kurgans from the site corresponding to modern Boryspil attests that the Scythians also appear to have captured territories from the tribes of the forest steppe at this time.

======On the Pontic coast======
The peaceful relations which had until then prevailed between the Scythian kingdom and the Greek colonies of the northern Pontic region came to an end during the period of expansionism in the early 5th century BC, when the Scythian kings for the first time started trying to impose their rule over the Greek colonies. In response to hostility from the Scythian kingdom, the Greek cities erected defensive installations while their were destroyed or abandoned, meaning that they lost their agricultural production base, while burials of men killed by Scythian arrows started appearing in their .

At the same time, because the Scythian kingdom still needed to trade with the Greeks in the lower Tanais region, in the early 5th century BC it replaced the formerly destroyed Greek colony of Krēmnoi with a Scythian settlement for this purpose, located at the site corresponding to present-day in the delta of the Tanais river. The population of this 40 hectare settlement was composed mostly of Scythians and a minority community of Greek merchants, with a smaller fortified section of this city being the residence of the local Scythian aristocrats, thus putting trade in this region directly under the control of the Scythian kingdom.

The hold of the Scythian kingdom on the western part of the northern Pontic region became firmer under the reign of the king Scyles, who was successfully able to impose Scythian rule on the Greek colonies in the northwestern Pontic coastal region and western Crimea, such as Nikōnion, Tyras, Pontic Olbia, and Kerkinitis, so that Scyles was minting coins at Nikōnion while Kerkinitis was paying tribute to the Scythian kingdom.

There was consequently a considerable migration of Scythians into Pontic Olbia at this time, and Scyles himself possessed a residence in Olbia which he would visit every year. The Greek colonies of the Black Sea coast thus continued adhering to their Hellenic culture while their population was very mixed, with Scythians being active at all levels of these cities, which even attracted Scythian aristocrats. During this period Greek influences also became more significant among the Scythians, especially among the aristocracy, while the inhabitants of the cities of the north shore of the Black Sea themselves borrowed the use of Scythian bows and swords.

The control of Scyles over the city of Nikōnion corresponded to the period when it was a member of the Delian League, thus putting it under the simultaneous hegemony of both the Scythian kingdom and the Greek city of Athens. This, as well as the contacts established by Athens in the Tauric Chersonese during this period, allowed the Scythian kingdom to engage in indirect relations with Athens when it was at the height of its power. In consequence, a community of Scythians also lived in Athens at this time and was active at all levels of society, as attested by the presence of graves of deceased Scythians in the cemetery of the Kerameikos, where a Scythian retainer had also been buried in the grave precinct of his master.

In the region of the Cimmerian Bosporus, while the Scythian kingdom was initially able to capture Nymphaion, it was however less successful at conquering the other Greek colonies there, where around 30 cities, including Myrmēkion, Tyritakē, and Porthmeus, banded together into an alliance under the leadership of Pantikapaion, built or strengthened their city walls, and successfully defended their independence. After this, they united into the Bosporan kingdom with Pantikapaion as its capital so as to manage their trade ventures and to organise their common defence against the Scythians. The Bosporan kingdom soon became a centre of production for Scythian customers living in the steppes, and, being a significant outpost of Greek culture, it therefore influenced both the Scythians and the Sindi by contributing to the development of Scythian art and style.

Despite the conflicts between the Scythian kingdom and the Greek cities, mutually beneficial exchanges between the Scythians, Maeotians and Greeks continued, and, throughout the Pontic Steppe, Scythians and Greeks lived and died in the same communities, with the presence of Scythian burials in this city&#x27;s necropolis attesting of the presence of marriages between the ruling elite of Nymphaion and the Scythian aristocracy.

=====Commercial activities=====
======Grain trading======
As result of these expansionist ventures, the Scythian kingdom, whose core population lived in the steppe between the forest steppe and the coastal region and therefore dominated these latter two regions, implemented an economic policy through a division of labour according to which:
*the settled populations of the forest steppe produced grain, which until then they were allowed to freely sell, but were now obliged to offer to the Scythian aristocracy as tribute;
*this grain offered in tribute was then shipped through the Borysthenēs and Hypanis rivers to Pontic Olbia, Tyras, and Nikōnion;
*these latter Greek cities, who had to specialise in trading after having lost their agricultural lands, in turn acted as trading agents by selling the grain at a profit for themselves.

The outbreak of the Peloponnesian War in Greece proper in 431 BC to some extent further increased the importance of the Pontic Steppe in supplying grain to Greece, so that the Bosporan kingdom became the main supplier of grain to Greece, and the Scythian kingdom in turn became an important seller of grain to the Bosporan kingdom: the Scythian nomadic aristocracy thus became the main intermediary in providing to the Bosporan kingdom the grain produced from the fertile and traditionally agricultural regions of the forest steppe and obtained through cultivation within the Scythian kingdom itself.

======Slave trading======
In the 5th century itself, the Greek cities in the Aegean Sea had started to import slaves from Scythia immediately after the end of the Persian invasions of Greece. The Greek cities acted as slave trade hubs but did not themselves capture slaves, and instead depended on the Scythian rulers to acquire slaves for them: although Scythian society was not heavily dependent on slaves, unlike the Greeks, the Scythian aristocrats nonetheless still found it profitable to acquire slaves from their subordinate tribes or through military raids in the forest steppe, who were then brought to Pontic Olbia, where they were sold to Greek merchants.
Among the Scythian slaves bought by the Greeks, one particular group was bought immediately after the Battle of Salamis by the city of Athens, where they constituted an organisation of public slaves employed by the city itself as an urban police force who acted as watchmen and guards and maintained order among the general publics. These &quot;Scythian archers&quot; would round up unwilling citizens and kettle them to vote, could be called by the chairman of the  to remove anyone speaking for too long, and had the power to make arrests.

======Other Scythian exports======
In addition to slaves, the Scythians sold cattle and animal products to the Greeks.

======Import of Greek goods======
The Greek colonies during this time were the main suppliers of luxury goods and art to the Scythians, and Greek-type gold objects from Scythian graves of this period may thus have originated as gifts from Greek dependants or Greek families allied to Scythian aristocrats which had been offered to these aristocrats as part of complex gifting traditions used to make and secure fealty bonds or form family ties through marriage.

Trade with the Greeks especially created a thriving demand for wine in Scythia: In exchange for slaves, the Greeks sold various consumer goods to the Scythians, the most prominent among these being wine. The island of Chios in the Aegean Sea, especially, produced wine to be sold to the Scythians, in exchange of which slaves from Scythia were sold in the island&#x27;s very prominent slave market.

Other commodities sold by the Greeks to the Scythians included fabrics, vessels, decorations made of precious metals, bronze items, and black burnished pottery.

====== Economic prosperity ======
Under these conditions, the grain and slave trade continued, and Pontic Olbia not only did not decline, but instead experienced economic prosperity.

The Scythian aristocracy also derived immense revenue from these commercial activities with the Greeks, most especially from the grain trade, with Scythian coins struck in Greek cities bearing the images of ears of grain. This prosperity of the Scythian aristocracy is attested by how Scythian art in this period largely celebrated the military success of the Scythian mounted warriors, as well as by how the lavish aristocratic burials progressively included more relatives, retainers, and were richly furnished with grave goods, especially imported ones, consisting of gold jewellery, silver and gold objects, including fine Greek-made toreutics, vessels and jewellery, and gold-plated weapons.

There was a very significant stratification in Scythia in terms of social and property among both the aristocratic and commoner the Scythians during this period, and Scythian commoners did not obtain any benefits from this trade, with luxury goods being absent from their tombs. That this economic success was limited to the Scythian aristocracy is reflected by how Scythian art in this period largely portrayed elements of prestige, as well as the divinisation of royal power, the cults of ancestral heroes, and celebrated military valour.

=====Greek influence=====

A consequence of the Scythians&#x27; close contacts with the Greek cities and of their import of Greek-manufactured art and luxury goods was that Greek art significantly influenced Scythian art and artistic preferences, in turn causing a progressive Hellenisation of the Scythian aristocracy.

The Greek supply of luxury goods in turn influenced Scythian art, so that the vegetal motifs which the Greek artisans used to decorate these goods were organically integrated into the &quot;Animal Style&quot; art of the Scythians and became used in works produced by both Greek and Scythian craftsmen.

Greek influence thus became a factor which shaped the evolution of Scythian weapons and horse harnesses, which were developed following Scythian norms and slowly perfected so they could be used more effectively: the Scythian composite armour, for example, was fitted with Greek-type shoulder guards in the 5th century BC.

=====Early sedentarisation=====
Beginning the 6th century BC, a period of deepening ties and the intensification of trade with the already sedentary Greeks led to the development of sedentary forms of economy in the more nomadic parts of the Scythian kingdom; the climate of the steppe around this time also became warmer and wetter, which caused grass which the nomads to rear their large herds of animals to grow abundance, thus allowing them to settle down in the steppe itself; these factors acted as catalysts for the process of sedentarisation of many nomadic Scythians which started during the Middle Scythian period in the late 5th century BC.

The Scythian aristocracy, who played an important role in the grain trade and were its primary profiters, were investing in increasing the grain production within the Scythian kingdom, and therefore expanded cereal cultivations to the regions adjacent to the Bosporan kingdom through which they exported their grain, especially in the Tauric Chersonese. This policy acted as a catalyst for the intensification of the process of sedentarisation of the Scythians, especially along the reaches of the lower Borysthenēs where the terrain was propitious for agriculture.

This process of sedentarisation was especially concentrated in the eastern part of the Tauric Chersonese, near the cities of the Bosporan Kingdom, but it was also occurring elsewhere in Scythia, with several village-sites forming on the left bank of the estuary of the Tyras near Nikōnion, and nomadic Scythians who had settled down had founded along the banks of the Borysthenēs and the smaller rivers of the steppe small settlements where were cultivated large amounts of crops such as wheat, millet and barley.

Consequently, part of the nomadic Scythians were adopting a settled lifestyle during the 5th century BC, especially along the reaches of the lower Borysthenēs where the terrain was propitious for agriculture, and where they formed small unfortified settlements. Part of the population of the of Pontic Olbia at this time was also composed of settled Scythians. The archaeological evidence suggests that the population of the Tauric Chersonese, most of whom were Scythians who had settled down to farm, during this time increased by 600%, especially in the Trachean Chersonese.

The development sedentarisation and settlement-formation finally led to the foundation in the late 5th and early 4th centuries BC of several new city-sites: among these settlements were important city-sites located on major routes which provided access to the major rivers of Scythia, and corresponding to present-day Yelizavetovskaya at the mouth of the Tanais, Traxtemyriv on the upper Borysthenēs, Nadlymansʹke near the estuary of Tyras, on the Vorskla river, and Kamianka at the confluence of the Borysthenēs and its tributary of the Konka river.

Despite this significant sedentarisation of the nomads, the majority of Scythians during this time and until the 3rd century BC however still remained composed of nomads.

===== The city of Kamianka =====
Internal tribal migrations within the Scythian kingdom during the 5th century BC appear to have caused central power to move to the region of the bend of the Borysthenēs, so that much of the Scythian settlements of the 5th and 4th centuries BC were located in the valley of the Borysthenēs and of its tributaries until the coastal region: the site of Kamianka, located in the Borysthenēs bend region and built in the late 5th century BC, was the largest and most important of the Scythian city-sites, measuring 12 square kilometres, and was protected by earthen ramparts, moats, the rivers and the salt lake of Bilozerka.

The &quot;acropolis&quot; of Kamianka was located high above the Konka river and was separated from the outer city by double-shell earthworks and a rampart topped by a Greek-style mudbrick wall. Large amounts of Greek red-figure pottery, wine , black lacquerware,  for mixing wine and water, imported jewellery, and bones of game animals killed during hunts have been found in the &quot;acropolis&quot; of Kamianka by archaeologists, implying that it was the location of the seasonal royal Scythian headquarters; much of the goods from the &quot;acropolis&quot; of Kamianka, such as the Greek pottery, were Bosporan-imported, attesting of the close links between the Scythian and Bosporan kingdoms at this time.

By the Middle Scythian period, the centre of Scythian metallurgy had shifted into the steppe, in the &quot;outer city&quot; of Kamianka, which was considerably larger than the acropolis, and was the residence of an agriculturalist population as well as of the metalsmiths who manufactured objects from copper, lead and zinc, gold- and silverwork, such as tools, simple jewellery, as well as weapons and armour and horse trappings used by the nomadic population of the steppe. Kamianka contained several blacksmiths&#x27; workshops which were contentrated into craftsmens&#x27; quarters, with 900 hectares of the city being dedicated to industrial scale metal production.

An open tract in was also located in the southeast of the &quot;outer city,&quot; and was perhaps used for grazing cattle, sheep and goats or for defensive purposes.

Thus, the city of Kamianka had become the economic, political and commercial capital of the Scythian kingdom in the late 5th century BC.

=====The city of Yelizavetovskaya=====
During this period, in the 5th to early 4th centuries BC, the site corresponding to present-day Yelizavetovskaya had become a well-fortified city where resided the local Scythian clan and tribal lords, and which functioned as the Scythian kingdom&#x27;s administrative, commercial and manufacturing centre for the lower Tanais and northern Maeotian sea region.

====Succession struggle====
Some time around , Scyles was overthrown by his half-brother Octamasadas, who was himself the son of Ariapeithes and of the daughter of the Odrysian king Tērēs I. Scyles fled to the Odrysian kingdom, but Tērēs I&#x27;s son and successor to the Odrysian kingship, Sitalkēs, met his nephew Octamasadas on the Odrysian-Scythian border on the Istros river, where Sitalkēs handed to him his half-brother Scyles, was executed by Octamasadas, while Octamasadas himself handed to Sitalkēs one of his uncles, a brother of Sitalkēs who had fled to Scythia.

Nothing is known about the third son of Ariapeithes, Oricus, other than that his mother was a Scythian woman and that he was likely the youngest son of Ariapeithes. Oricus might have even never become king, and some time after Octamasadas ousted Scyles, coins were minted in Pontic Olbia bearing the name of one Eminakos, who was either a governor of Olbia for Octamasadas or a successor of his.

=====External relations=====
As a result of the Scythian kingdom&#x27;s prosperity during this period, neighbouring populations borrowed elements of Scythian culture.

======With Central and Western Europe======
The populations of Central and Western Europe were still borrowing from the Scythians at this time, and Scythian-type arrowheads were found in these regions.

======With Thrace======

Thanks to the close family connections of Octamasadas to the Thracian Odrysian dynasty through his mother, contacts between the Scythian kingdom and Odrysian-ruled Thrace intensified during the period from to .

Significant Thracian influence consequently appeared in the grave goods of Scythian kurgans made of precious metals, with the art of Scythian bridle trappings from this period exhibiting influences from Thracian art. Thracian influence on Scythian culture was also visible in the 5th century BC in the form of Scythian production of single-bladed swords based on Thracian battle knives which had handles and crosspieces typical of the Scythian .

And, due to the influential position of the Scythian kingdom at this time, the Thracian Getae of the Carpathian and Balkan regions were importing large amounts of Scythian-manufactured weapons and horse equipment.

======With the Bosporan kingdom======
Soon after the accession of Octamasadas around , a Thracian aristocrat residing in Pantikapaion named Spartocus seized leadership of the Bosporan kingdom in , becoming the first member of the Spartocid dynasty to rule the Bosporan kingdom. with the rise of the Thracian Spartocus I being possibly connected to the assumption of the pro-Odrysian Octamasadas as king of Scythia.

These changes in the Bosporan Kingdom also led to cultural changes within it in the late 5th century BC, so that the Greek customs which had until then been normative there gave way to more Scythian ones.

Under the Spartocid dynasty, the Bosporan kingdom would thrive and maintain stable military, political and economic relations with the Scythian kingdom which allowed it, with Scythian support, to be able expand its rule to the whole Trachean and Sindic Chersoneses and conquer several non-Greek territories on the Asian side of the Cimmerian Bosporus so that it soon covered a wide territory stretching across the whole eastern coast of the Maeotian Sea till the mouth of the Tanais river in the north.

This process transformed the Bosporan kingdom into a cosmopolitan realm whose populations consisted of Greeks descended not only from the original settlers in the region as well as more recently arrived Athenian colonists, but also of Hellenised Thracians; members of this population in turn intermarried with Scythians from the Tauric Chersonese and Sauromatians living to the east of the Tanais river, which further added to the ethnic diversity of the Bosporan Kingdom.

It was then that Pontic Olbia started declining, partly due to the instability within the Scythian steppe to its north, but also because most of the trade, including the grain exports of the Scythian kingdom, passing through Oblia until then shifted to transiting through the cities of the Cimmerian Bosporus constiting the Bosporan Kingdom at this time.

The Scythians instead started importing ornaments, expensive weapons, horse harness decorations, cultic vessels made of previous metals, and pottery mostly manufactured in Pantikapaion in the Bosporan kingdom, and much of the grave goods, such as finely decorated vases, , toreutics, headgear and footwear for the Scythian aristocracy, jewellery, and decorative plaques for  and to decorate clothing, had been made in Bosporan Greek workshops, whose products thus replaced Olbian ones.

Thus, while Pontic Olbia was slowly declining, the trade between the Scythian and Bosporan kingdom continued to thrive, with the cities of the Cimmerian Bosporus being the main transit point through which Pontic Scythia was importing luxury goods from Thrace and fine tableware and wine from Greece, and where were located the workshops of the Greek craftsmen who produced luxurious goldwork for the new Scythian aristocracy.

Around that same time, Athenian commercial influence in the Bosporan Kingdom started declining, and, despite Athens sending someone as renowned as Pericles to negotiate, its influence in the Bosporan Kingdom had fully come to an end by the time that it had lost the Peloponnesian War in 404 BC.

======With Athens======
However, following Athens&#x27;s defeat in the Peloponnesian War, the Greeks living on the north shore of the Black Sea started buying more grain from the Scythians to export to Athens to end the food shortage there, resulting in the growth of trade with the Greek cities of the northern Black Sea.

=====Second wave of Sauromatian immigration=====
With the pressure of groups of the Massagetae moving into the countries of the Sauromatians in the regions between the Ural Mountains and the Tanais river continuing, sometime between and , a second wave of migration of Sauromatians from the Araxes Steppe entered Scythia, where these newcomers intermarried with the Scythian tribes already present there after which they may possibly have established themselves as the new ruling aristocracy of the Scythian kingdom.

The Royal Scythians might possibly left the Borysthenēs river valley under pressure from the new Sauromatian incomers and moved to the west, where they consolidated themselves on the coastal area to the west of the Hypanis river, and established their new headquarters in the northwestmost part of Thracian coast located immediately to the south of the Istros river. The sedendary communities of the forest steppe also came under pressure from this new wave of nomadic incomers.

=====Period of instability=====
The immigration into Scythia of the new wave of Sauromatian arrivants as well as the internal conflicts among the Scythians themselves, caused a temporary destabilisation of the Scythian kingdom which caused it to lose control of the Greek cities on the north shores of the Black Sea. Thus, the Greek colonies no longer faced any military threats from the Scythians, as evidenced by how Pontic Olbia, Nikōnion, and Tyras started to not only rebuild their , but even expanded them during the late 5th and early 4th centuries BC. It was also at this time that the Scythian kingdom lost control over Nymphaion, which was annexed by the Bosporan kingdom, which had itself been expanding its territories on the Asian side of the Cimmerian Bosporus.

The second wave of Sauromatian immigration had however also brought an end to the earlier trade routes of Scythia linking Olbia to the rich region of the middle Borysthenēs river where were located the markets it served, thus reducing its influence to a small coastal area between the Tyras and Borysthenēs rivers and initiating a period of slow decline for this city.

====Golden Age====
The period of instability ended soon, and Scythian culture experienced a period of prosperity during the 4th century BC, which was an unusually calm period in the broader Pontic and Danubian regions.
About 3,000 Scythian funerary monuments from the 4th century BC, and, out of those 2,300 already excavated by archaeologists in the 1980s, nearly 2,000 dated from this period while a smaller number dated from the preceding 5th century BC: with most Scythian monuments and the richest Scythian royal burials dating from this period, as exemplified by the lavish .

Most of the Scythian royal tombs of the 5th and 4th centuries BC were largely located in the country of , which corresponds to Borysthenēs river valley within a 45 kilometre wide radius from the river&#x27;s rapids that prevent further northwards navigation on the river. It is from the 4th century BC itself that can be dated two of the most lavishly furnished groups of Scythian burials in the region of the Borysthenēs rapids:
*the &quot;royal&quot; burials, which were the richest group, consisted of the Solokha mohyla, , , , , and ;
*the &quot;aristocratic&quot; burials were the second richest group, and included the , Tovsta, , 8th barrow of the , , , and ;
*in addition to these, several Scythian burials were also present in the territories of the Greek colonies of the north shore of the Black Sea, such as several rich tombs from the necropolis of Nymphaion, and the very lavish Kul-Oba kurgan near Pantikapaion.

=====Trade with the Greeks=====
This height of Scythian power corresponded to a time of unprecedented prosperity for the Greek colonies of the northern Black Sea, with whom the relations of the Scythian kingdom remained peaceful during this period: there was high demand for the Greek cities&#x27; trade goods, grains, slaves, and fish, thanks to which the relations between the Pontic and Aegean regions, especially with Athens, were flourishing.Although the Greek cities of the coast extended their territories considerably at this time, this did not infringe on the Scythians, who still possessed abundant pastures and whose settlements were still thriving. A large number of the toreutics used by the Scythians themselves as aristocratic and royal grave goods were during this period being made by Greek craftsmen, attesting of the strong Greek influence that the Scythians were then coming under and of the increasingly pronounced Hellenisation of the Scythian upper classes. Consequently, Scythian culture, especially that of the aristocracy, experienced rapidly-occurring extensive Hellenisation as a result of these extensive contacts with the Greek colonies on the Black Sea shore in the 4th century BC.

======Scytho-Bosporan relations======
The rule of the Spartocid dynasty in the Bosporan Kingdom under the kings Leukon I, Spartocus II and Pairisadēs I was also favourable for the Scythian kingdom because they provided stability which allowed both the Scythian and Bosporan kingdoms to flourish. Leukon employed Scythians in his army, and he was able to capture Theodosia with the help of Scythian horse cavalry, which he claimed to trust more than his own army.

Extensive contacts existed between the Scythian and Bosporan nobilities, possibly including dynastic marriages between the Scythian and Bosporan royalty: the rich burial of Kul-Oba belonged to one such Scythian noble who had close family ties to a member of the Bosporan aristocracy or even the ruling Spartocid dynasty, and who therefore chose to be buried at Kul-Oba following Scythian rites in a Greek-style tomb carved from stone.

During this time, and with the support of the Scythian kings, the sedentarised Scythian farmers sold large amounts of grain reaching up to 16,000 tonnes to Pantikapaion, who in turn sold this grain to Athens in mainland Greece. The dealings between mainland Greece and the northern Pontic region were significant enough that the Athenian Dēmosthenēs had significant commercial endeavours in the Bosporan kingdom, from where he received a 1000  of wheat per year, and he had the statues of the Bosporan rulers Pairisadēs I, Satyros I and Gorgippos insalled in the Athenian market.

Dēmosthenēs himself had had a Scythian maternal grandmother, and his political opponents Dinarchus and Aeschines went so far as to launch racist attacks against Dēmosthenēs by referring to his Scythian ancestry to attempt discrediting him.

=====Early Sarmatian immigration=====
The Scythian kingdom experienced an early wave of immigration by a related Iranic nomadic people, the Sarmatians, during the 4th century BC, to the Pontic steppe. This slow flow of Sarmatian immigration continued during the late 4th and early 3rd centuries BC, but these small and isolated groups did not negatively affect its hegemony.

====The reign of Ateas====
Between and 339 BC, the Scythians were ruled by their most famous king, Ateas, whose reign coincided with the growth of the kingdom of Macedonia under its king Philip II into a powerful kingdom capable of annexing much of Thrace until the Istros river. Estimates for the extent of the power of Ateas range from him having united all of Scythia from the Istros to the Tanais under his power to him being a leader of a group of Scythians who had retreated westwards under Sauromatian pressure and ruling only the western part of the Scythian kingdom.

By this period, Scythian tribes had already settled permanently on the lands to the south of the Istros corresponding to the region now called the Dobruja, and possibly in what is presently the Ludogorie region as well, where the people of Ateas lived with their families and their livestock. Consequently, the Tauric Chersonese and the region between the lower Istros and the Black Sea in northeastern Thrace both started being called &quot;Little Scythia&quot; (; ).

The main activities of Ateas were directed towards the Scythian border with Thrace on the Istros, so that by around he had captured lands from the Getae and expanded Scythian hegemony to the lands south of the Istros and to the Greek cities of the coast of the Black Sea and the parts of Thrace immediately south of the Istros, where he captured Kallatis and issued coins there. Ateas also successfully battled the Thracian Triballi and the Dacian Histriani, as well as threatened to conquer the city of Byzantion, where he may also have struck his coins.

Since both Ateas and Philip had been interested in the region to the immediate south of the Istros, the two kings formed an alliance against the Histriani. However, this alliance soon fell apart after Ateas refused to support Philip II&#x27;s advance on Byzantion, and war broke out between the Scythian and Macedonian kingdoms, ending in 339 BC in a battle at the estuary of the Istros where died the then 90 year old Ateas while Philip II was wounded, after which the Macedonians captured 20,000 Scythian women and children, a large number of cattle and more than 20,000 thoroughbred horses.

The Scythian kingdom had lost its new territories in Thrace and to the north of the Istros due to this defeat, which allowed the Getae to cross the Istros and settle between the Pyretos and the Tyras rivers. The power of Scythian kingdom was however not harmed by the death of Ateas, and it did not experience any weakening or disintegration as a result of it: the Kamianka city continued to prosper and the Scythian burials from this time were still as lavishly-furnished as those of the most prosperous periods of the 4th century BC, and a Scythian population continued to live in northeast Thrace.

====The late 4th century BC====
The defeat against Philip II would however be followed by a series of military defeats of the Scythian kingdom which would lead to it experiencing a very significant decline during the late 4th century BC.

Although the experience of Philip II&#x27;s military dealings with the Scythians led his son Alexander III to choose to avoid attacking the then still powerful Scythians, in 335 BC Alexander III crossed the Istros into Scythian territory during his campaign against the Getae, which harmed the remaining trade networks that Pontic Olbia could still depend on.

Between 339 and 329 BC, a Scythian king whose name has not been recorded fought a war against the king Pairisadēs I of the Bosporan kingdom.

In 331 or 330 BC, Alexander III&#x27;s general Zopyrion, who was then acting as the governor of Thrace, campaigned against the Getae and the Scythian kingdom. Although Zōpyriōn&#x27;s army of 30,000 men was able to reach Pontic Olbia and besiege it, they failed to capture it, and were defeated by the Scythians, with Zopyrion himself getting killed. Despite Zopyrion&#x27;s defeat, his attack initiated the final decline of Olbia, and various tribes from the West such as the Celts started moving into its territories.

Nevertheless, in 329 BC, the Scythian kingdom sent an embassy to Alexander at the time of his campaign in Bactria and Sogdia, after which Alexander sent an ambassador of his own to go to Pontic Scythia with the returning Scythian embassy. Alexander&#x27;s ambassador came back with another Scythian embassy after he had spent the winter in Bactria. During this time, the king of Scythia died and was succeeded by his brother, Agaros, in .

In 313 BC, the Agaros attempted to invade the territory to the south of the Istros again, but was defeated by the Macedonian king of Thrace, the diadoch Lysimachus.

In 309 BC, Agaros participated in the Bosporan Civil War on the side of Satyros II, son of Pairisadēs I, against his half-brother Eumēlos. Agaros provided Satyros with 20,000 infantrymen and 10,000 cavalrymen, and after Satyros was defeated and killed, his son, also named Paerisades, fled to Agaros&#x27;s realm for refuge.

In the early 3rd century BC, the Scythian kingdom started declining economically as a result of competition from Egypt, which under the Ptolemaic dynasty had again become a supplier of grain to Greece.

====End of Pontic Scythia====
In the early 3rd century BC, the Scythian kingdom faced a number of interlocking unfavourable conditions, such as climatic changes in the steppes and economic crises from overgrazed pastures and a series of military setbacks, as well as the intensifiation of the arrival from the east of the Sarmatians, who launched ravaging attacks against the Scythians, defeated them, and captured their pastures, with the smaller and more active Sarmatian groups overwhelming and subjugating the more numerous but politically static Scythians With the deprivation of its pastures, which were its most important resource, the Scythian kingdom suddenly collapsed, Scythian rule over the Pontic Steppe ended, and the Scythian capital of Kamianka was abandoned.

The Sarmatian tribe responsible for most of the destruction of the Pontic Scythian kingdom were the Roxolani, who had in the 4th century BC lived the trans-Araxes region, and from there crossed the Tanais river and captured the Pontic Steppe up to the Borysthenēs, where they may have become a mixed Scytho-Sarmatian tribe at this time.

As a consequence of the sudden end of the Pontic Scythian kingdom, the material culture of the Scythians also disappeared in the early 3rd century BC, with the large Scythian kurgans stopping being built and the large cities, such as the one at Gelonus, being abandoned at that time, and there being no known Scythian or Sarmatian monuments from this period. With the end of the Scythian kingdom, the peoples of the forest steppe became independent again returned to their original mixed farmer sedentary lifestyle while all Scythian elements disappeared from their culture.

With the end of the Pontic Scythian kingdom, grain exports from the northern Pontic region declined drastically, while Greek inscriptions stopped mentioning names of Scythian slaves, which were instead replaced by slaves of Sarmatian, Maeotian and other northern Pontic origins.

Following the invasion, the Sarmatian tribes became the new dominant force of the Pontic Steppe, resulting in the name &quot; () replacing &quot; as the name of the Pontic Steppe, and the name &quot;Sarmatians&quot; replacing that of &quot;Scythians&quot; as the generic designation of the peoples of the Pontic-Caspian Steppes until the invasion of the Huns.

Sarmatian pressure against the Scythians continued in the 3rd century BC, so that the Sarmatians had reached as far as the city of Chersonesus in the Tauric Chersonese by 280 BC, and most native and Greek settlements on the north shore of the Black Sea were destroyed by the Sarmatians over the course of the to , causing the Greek cities of the north shore of the Black Sea to decline, sometimes even into desolate ruins.

Around this time, the Scythians of the Tauric Chersonese had already become vassals of a Sarmatian tribe whose queen Amage allied with the city of Chersonesus. At one point, Amage intervened against these Scythian vassals of hers and executed their king for being rebellious. The historicity of Amage is however unclear.

In the regions to the west of the Borysthenēs, some Celtic groups crossed the Carpathians and settled down in the valleys of the Tyras and Pyretus rivers. These Celts, along with the Thracian Getae and the Germanic Bastarnae from the west, were also putting the Scythians under pressure by seizing their lands to expand their own territories.

By around some time between and , the Protogenes inscriptions recorded the Scythians as one of the minor groups who, along with the Sarmatian tribes of the Thisamatae and Saudaratae, were seeking shelter from the allied forces of the Celtic Galatae and the Germanic Sciri in the region of the Borysthenēs river near Pontic Olbia.

By the early 2nd century BC, the Bastarnae had grown powerful enough that they were able to stop the southward advance of the Sarmatians along the line of the Istros river.

===Late period===

With the Sarmatian invasion and the collapse of the Pontic Scythian kingdom, the Scythians were pushed to the fringes of the northern Pontic region where urban life was still possible, and they retreated to a series of fortified settlements along the major rivers and fled to the two regions both known as &quot;Little Scythia,&quot; which remained the only places where the Scythians could still be found in by the 2nd century BC were:
* the first Little Scythia, whose capital was Scythian Neapolis, was composed of the territories of the Tauric Chersonese and the lower reaches of the Borysthenēs and Hypanis rivers;
* the second Little Scythia was located in the northeast of Thrace immediately to the south of the mouth of the Istros river and the west of the Black Sea, in the territory corresponding to present-day Dobruja.
By this time, although the Scythians living in the Tauric Chersonese had managed to retain some of their nomadic lifestyle, the limited area of their polity forced them to become more and more sedentary and to primarily engage in stockbreeding in far away pastures, as well as in agriculture, and they also acted as trading intermediaries between the Graeco-Roman world and the peoples of the steppes.

With sedentarisation, both fortified and unfortified settlements replaced the older nomadic camps in the basin of the lower Borysthenēs river, which prevented the remaining Scythians from continuing to maintain a steppe economy. Therefore, the number of fortified settlements in the Tauric Chersonese increased with the retreat into this territory and away from the steppe of the Scythian aristocracy, who was then rapidly embracing a Hellenistic lifestyle. By the 1st century BC, these Scythians living in the Tauric Chersonese had fully become sedentary farmers.

These later Scythians slowly intermarried with the native Tauri and the infiltrating Sarmatians, and their culture had little to do with the earlier classical Scythian culture, instead consisting of a combination of those with the traditions of the Tauroi from the mountains of the Tauric Chersonese and of the Greeks of the coasts, and exhibiting Sarmatian and La Tène Celtic influences.

In the 1st century BC, both Little Scythias were destroyed and their territories annexed by the king Mithridates VI Eupator of the kingdom of Pontus despite the Scythians&#x27; alliance with their former enemies, the Roxolani, against him.

===End===
The Scythian populations in both Little Scythias continued to exist after the end of Mithridates&#x27;s empire, although they had become fully sedentary by then and were increasingly intermarrying with the native Tauri, hence why Roman sources often referred to them as &quot;Tauro-Scythians&quot; (; ).

These late Scythians were slowly assimilated by the Sarmatians over the course of to AD, although they continued to exist as an independent people throughout the 2nd century AD until around AD: in the settled regions of the lower Borysthenēs, lower Hypanis, and the Tauric Chersonese, an urbanised and Hellenised Scythian society continued to develop which also exhibited Thracian and Celtic influences.

The Scytho-Sarmatian Iranic nomads&#x27; dominance of the Pontic Steppe finally ended with the invasion of the Goths and other Germanic tribes around , which was when the Scythian settlements in Crimea and the lower Borysthenēs were permanently destroyed.

The Scythians nevertheless continued to exist until the invasion of the Huns in the 4th century BC, and they finally ceased to exist as an independent group after being fully assimilated by the other populations who moved into the Pontic Steppe at the height of the Migrations Period in the 5th century BC.

===Legacy===
The Graeco-Roman peoples were profoundly fascinated by the Scythians. This fascination endured in Europe even after both the disappearance of the Scythians and the end of Graeco-Roman culture, and continued throughout Classical and Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, lasting till the 18th century in the Modern Period.

====Antiquity====
=====In West Asia=====
The inroads of the Cimmerians and the Scythians into West Asia over the course of the 8th to 7th centuries BC, which were early precursors of the later invasions of West Asia by steppe nomads such as the Huns, various Turkic peoples, and the Mongols, in Late Antiquity and the Mediaeval Period, had destabilised the political balance which had prevailed in the region between the dominant great powers of Assyria, Urartu, and Phrygia, and also caused the decline and destruction of several of these states&#x27; power, consequently to the rise of multiple new powers such as the empires of the Medes and Lydians, thus irreversibly changing the geopolitical situation of West Asia.

These Cimmerians and Scythians also influenced the developments in West Asia through the spread of the steppe nomad military technology brought by them into this region, and which were disseminated during the periods of their respective hegemonies in West Asia.
The inroads of the Cimmerians and Scythians in West Asia over the course of the late-8th to late-7th century BC led to significant changes in this region.

The Achaemenid Persian Empire indiscriminately referred to the steppe nomads as : within this scheme, the Scythians of the northern Pontic region were labelled in Old Persian texts as ((; , in contrast to the (; and (; who lived in Central Asia.

The ancient Israelites called the Scythians (), which through a scribal error was corrupted to  (), appears in the Hebrew Bible, where is closely linked to  (), that is to the Cimmerians.

The Hebrew Bible also mentions ʾAškənāz together with (), that is Mannai, and (), that is Urartu, reflecting how the Scythian core territory in West Asia was located close to these two states.

=====In ancient art=====
The ancient Greeks from Anatolia who had witnessed the wars between the Scythians and Cimmerians symbolically depicted Scythian warriors during the 6th to 5th centuries BC as hunting dogs in the midst of battle. This was a Greek folkloric reinterpretation of young Scythian warriors who, following the Indo-European passage rite of the &quot;&quot;, would ritually take on the role of wolf- or dog-warriors.

=====In Graeco-Roman literature=====
The first mention of the Scythians in ancient Greek literature is in Hesiod&#x27;s , which refers to them as the &quot;mare-milking Scythians&quot; () and as the &quot;milk-drinkers who have wagons for houses&quot; () Hesiod also referred to the Scythians along with the Ethiopians and Libyans as peoples &quot;whose mind is over their tongue,&quot; that is who approve of prudent reserve.

======According to Herodotus of Halicarnassus======
Herodotus of Halicarnassus wrote a legendary account of the arrival of the Scythians into the lands of the Cimmerians:
* after the Scythians were expelled from Central Asia by the Massagetae, they moved to the west across the Araxes, and took possession of the Cimmerians&#x27; lands after chasing them away;
* the approach of the Scythians led to a civil war among the Cimmerians because the &quot;royal tribe&quot; wanted to remain in their lands and defend themselves from the invaders, while the rest of the people saw no use in fighting and preferred to flee;
* since neither side could be persuaded by the other, the &quot;royal tribe&quot; divided themselves into two equally numerous sides that fought each other till death, after which the commoners buried them by the Tyras river.

According to Herodotus, the Cimmerians fled to the south by following the shore of the Black Sea, and passed through Colchis before arriving in Anatolia. Meanwhile, the Scythians followed them, but missed the Cimmerians and instead followed the shore of the Caspian Sea, which led them into the lands of the Medes who were then besieging Nineveh under their king Cyaxares, who was defeated by the Scythians who then imposed their rule on Media and on all of Upper Asia for 28 years.

According to Herodotus&#x27;s account of the Cimmerians&#x27; flight, they moved south by following the shore of the Black Sea, while their Scythian pursuers followed the Caspian Sea&#x27;s coast, thus leading the Cimmerians into Anatolia and the Scythians into Media. While Cimmerian activities in Anatolia and Scythian activities in Media are attested, the claim that the Scythians arrived in Media while pursuing the Cimmerians is unsupported by evidence, and the arrival of the Scythians in West Asia about 40 years after that of the Cimmerians suggests that there is no available evidence to the later Graeco-Roman account of the Cimmerians crossing the Caucasus and moving south into West Asia under pressure from the Scythians migrating into their territories.

Herodotus&#x27;s narrative also contracted the events of the Scythians&#x27; arrival into West Asia by portraying Madyes as the king led them from the steppes into West Asia.

Herodotus also exaggerated the power of the Scythians in West Asia by claiming that they dominated all of it, which is a claim that finds no evidence for it in the Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian sources of the 7th century BC.

Herodotus&#x27;s narrative depicted Scythia as an opposite of Africa, especially Egypt, which was a theme continued by other ancient Greek authors, such as Pseudo-Hippocrates, who represented Greece as being the mean situated between these two extremes.

======In later Graeco-Roman literature======
By the 5th century BC, the image of the Scythians in Athens had become the quintessential stereotype used for Barbarians, that is for non-Greeks. Following the Greeks&#x27; caricatural representation of foreigners as being unmoderated drinkers, they increasingly associated the Scythians with drunkenness, which is a caricature that the later Greeks and the Romans also applied to the Celtic and Germanic peoples.

Ancient Greek authors consequently considered the Scythians and Persians, not as related Iranic peoples, but in opposition to each other:
*Greek authors held the Scythians as representing &quot;savagery&quot; and linked them to the Thracians;
*Greek authors meanwhile held the Persians as representing &quot;refined civilisation&quot; and connected them to the Assyrians and Babylonians.
This notion was reinforced by the Achaemenid invasion of Scythia, which the Greek authors interpreted as a model of the clash between &quot;nomadic savagery&quot; and &quot;sedentary civilisation.&quot;

Later Graeco-Roman tradition transformed the Scythian prince Anacharsis into a legendary figure as a kind of &quot;noble savage&quot; who represented &quot;Barbarian wisdom,&quot; due to which the ancient Greeks included him as one of the Seven Sages of Greece and he became a popular figure in Greek literature.

The 4th century BC Greek historian, Ephorus of Cyme, described the Scythians as one of the &quot;four great barbarian peoples&quot; of the known world, along with the Celts, Persians, and Libyans. Ephorus used the perception of Anacharsis as a personification of &quot;Barbarian wisdom&quot; to create an idealised image of the Scythians being as an &quot;invincible&quot; people, which became a tradition of Greek literature.

Ephorus created a fictitious account of a legendary Scythian king, named Idanthyrsos or Iandysos, who, 1500 years before the reign of the mythical first Assyrian king Ninus and 3000 years before the first Olympiad, allegedly defeated the equally legendary pharaoh Sesostris and became the ruler of all Asia. This story was a continuation of Ephorus of Cyme&#x27;s idealisation of the Scythians as an &quot;invincible&quot; people, and was drawn from Herodotus of Halicarnassus&#x27;s accounts of the Scythian invasion of Asia and the campaign of Darius in Scythia. This legend of the war between Idanthyrsos and Sesostris was itself based on Herodotus&#x27;s account of the Scythians&#x27; raid until the borders of Egypt, where the Saite king Psamtik I bribed them into turning back.

The Ancient Greeks included the Scythians in their mythology, with Herodorus of Heraclea making a mythical Scythian named Teutarus into a herdsman who served Amphitryon and taught archery to Heracles. Herodorus also portrayed the Titan Prometheus as a Scythian king, and, by extension, described Prometheus&#x27;s son Deucalion as a Scythian as well.

Strabo of Amasia in the 1st centuries BC and AD idealised the Scythians as leading a nomadic life founded on simplicity, thanks to which, according to him, they were the most simple, independent and honest, and the least perfidious people. According to Strabo&#x27;s narrative, the Scythians became &quot;corrupted&quot; and lost their simple and honest life because of the influence of the Greeks&#x27; &quot;love of luxury and sensual pleasures.&quot; Following Strabo, the Scythians continued to be represented as an idealised freedom-loving and truthful people Graeco-Roman literature.

The 1st century AD Jewish historian Flavius Josephus identified the Biblical Gog and Magog with the Scythians, or more generally with nomadic peoples from the north who were held back by the Caucasus Mountains and by the Gates of Alexander the Great.

The Romans confused the peoples whom they perceived as archetypical &quot;Barbarians,&quot; namely the Scythians and the Celts, into a single grouping whom they called the &quot;Celto-Scythians&quot; () and supposedly living from Gaul in the west to the Pontic steppe in the east.

======As general designation======
Herodotus also used the term &quot;&quot; to designate a number of non-Scythian ethnic groups of the Pontic Steppe as a result of them being dominated by the Scythians proper.

By the Roman period, the name of the Scythians was so widely used as a general designation for various peoples of the steppes that it was applied to various non-Scythian Sarmatian and Germanic tribes.

In Late Antiquity itself, as well as in and the Middle Ages, the name &quot;Scythians&quot; was used in Greco-Roman and Byzantine literature for various groups of nomadic &quot;barbarians&quot; living on the Pontic-Caspian Steppe who were not Scythians, like the Sarmatians and the Alans, or who were not related to the actual Scythians at all, such as the Huns, Goths, Ostrogoths, Gokturks, Pannonian Avars, Slavs, Pechenegs and Khazars.

For example, Byzantine sources referred to the Rus&#x27; raiders who attacked Constantinople in 860 AD in contemporary accounts as &quot;Tauroscythians&quot; because of their geographical origin, and despite their lack of any ethnic relation to Scythians.

=====Ancient grave robbing=====
The richness of Scythian burials was already well known in Antiquity, and, by the time the power of the Scythians came to an end in the 3rd century BC, the robbing of Scythian graves started and was initially carried out by Scythians themselves.

During Late Antiquity itself, another wave of grave robbery of Scythian burials occurred at the time of the Sarmatian and Hunnish domination of the Pontic Steppe, when these peoples reused older Scythian kurgans to bury their own dead.

====Mediaeval period====
Although the Scythians themselves had disappeared by the Middle Ages, the complex relations between their nomadic groupings and the settled populations of Southeast and Central Europe were continued by the Hungarians, the Bulgars, Rus and Poles.

Mediaeval authors followed the use of the name of the Scythians as an archaising term for steppe nomads to designate the Mongols.

=====In Mediaeval European literature=====
Following the Christianisation of Europe, the view that the peoples of this continent originated in West Asia as the descendants of Japheth became the normative historiography. At the same time, drawing on the Classical authors&#x27; lumping together of the ancient Celts and Scythians under the label of &quot;Barbarians,&quot; whereby these peoples, who were the for the Graeco-Romans, were pictured as sharing traits and resemble each other in how &quot;strange&quot; they were, the various cultures of North Europe started claiming ancestry from the &quot;Celto-Scythians&quot; and adopted the Graeco-Roman vision of the &quot;barbarity&quot; of ancient peoples of Europe as legitimate records of their own ancient cultures.

In this context, the similarity of the name with the Latin name of the Irish, , led to the flourishing of speculations of a Scythian ancestry of the Irish, as recorded in the  of Nennius, and consequently the 8th century text, the , claimed that a Scythian named Fénius Farsaid () presided over 27 scholars using the best parts of the new confused languages at Babel to create the Irish language.

Drawing on the confusion of the with both and the , as well as on the late antique conceptualisation of Scythia as a typical &quot;barbarian land&quot; which had persisted into the Middles Ages, Bede in the 8th century itself invented a Scythian origin for the Picts in his .

The Irish mythological text titled the  repeated this legend, and claimed that these supposed Scythian ancestors of the Irish had been invited to Egypt because the pharaoh admired how Nel, the son of Fénius, was knowledgeable on the world&#x27;s many languages, with Nel marrying the pharaoh&#x27;s daughter Scota. According to the , the Scythians fled from Egypt when pharaoh drowned after Moses parted the Red Sea during the flight of the Israelites, and went back to Scythia, and from there to Ireland via Africa and Spain while Nel&#x27;s and Scota&#x27;s son, Goídel Glas, became the eponym the Gaelic people.

=====Russian Chronicles=====
Continuing the Graeco-Roman tradition of referring to eastern peoples as &quot;Scythians,&quot; the 12th century Primary Chronicle referred to Kyivan Rus as &quot;Great Scythia&quot; ().

=====Mediaeval grave robbery=====
Little is known of the situation of Scythian tombs during the Mediaeval period, when Turkic tribes had moved into the regions formerly inhabited by the Scythians, although the earliest recorded cases of Scythian burials being robbed date from the 15th century BC.

====Modern period====
=====Modern pseudohistory=====
Drawing on the Biblical narrative and the Graeco-Roman conflation of the Scythians and Celts, early modern European scholars believed that the Celts were Scythians who were descended from Japheth&#x27;s son Magog, and that they were related to the Gauls, whom they believed were descended from Japheth&#x27;s other son Gomer. It therefore became popular among pseudohistorians of the 15th and 16th centuries who drew on this historiography to claim that the Irish people were the &quot;truest&quot; inheritors of Scythian culture so as both to distinguish and denigrate Irish culture.

During the early modern era itself, colonial ethnographers used the narrative of Herodotus of Halicarnassus to create an image of the Scythians as a notorious and &quot;savage&quot; people chauvinistically attached to their own customs and opposed to outside influences. Fascinated by this imagery, these ethnographers drew on it to claim populations who were completely unrelated to the Scythians, such as the Irish, Tatars, Mongols, Turks, and Indigenous peoples of the Americas, as being alleged descendants of the Scythians.

While claims of Scythian and Japhethic ancestry in much of Europe were abandoned during the Reformation and Renaissance, British works on Ireland continued to emphasise the alleged Scythian ancestry of the Irish to confirm their &quot;barbaric&quot; nature; these endeavours were further reinforced by 17th century proto-linguistic hypotheses about &quot;Scytho-Celtic&quot; languages and enjoyed enthusiastic popularity during the 18th century, until these origin hypotheses were finally discredited by early 19th century advances in philology and by the discovery of features common to the cultures of the ancient continental Celts and the Irish.

During the early modern period itself, Hungarian scholars identified the Hungarians with the Huns, and claimed that they descended from Scythians. Therefore, the image of the Scythians among Hungarians was shaped into one of &quot;noble savages&quot; who were valorous and honest, uncouth and hostile to &quot;Western refinement,&quot; but at the same time defended &quot;Christian civilisation&quot; from aggression from the East, such as from the Pechenegs, Cumans, and Tatars in the Middle Age, and from the Ottomans in the early modern period. This view was later superseded by the now established scientific consensus that the Hungarians are a Finno-Ugric people.

The 17th century Irish historian Roderick O&#x27;Flaherty continued the claim of the that the Irish descended from the Scythians in his history of Ireland titled , in which he identified Fénius Farsaid with the figure of Phoenix, who in Greek mythology was believed to have created the Phoenician alphabet. O&#x27;Flaherty elaborated on this by claiming that Fénius Farsaid also invented the Ogham script and the early Greek alphabet from which the Latin alphabet evolved.

In the 18th to 20th centuries, the racialist British Israelist movement developed a pseudohistory according to which, after population of the historical kingdom of Israel had been deported by the Neo-Assyrian Empire in 721 BC and became the Ten Lost Tribes, they fled to the north to the region near Sinope, from where they migrated into East and Central Europe and became the Scythians and Cimmerians, who themselves moved to north-west Europe and became the supposed ancestors of the white Protestant peoples of North Europe; being an antisemitic movement, British Israelists claim to be the most authentic heirs of the ancient Israelites while rejecting Jews as being &quot;contaminated&quot; through intermarriage with Edomites or adhere to the antisemitic conspiracy theory claiming that Jews descend from the Khazars. According to the scholar Tudor Parfitt, the proof cited by adherents of British Israelism is &quot;of a feeble composition even by the low standards of the genre.&quot;

=====Early modern grave robbery=====
Large scale robbery of Scythian tombs started when the Russian Empire started occupying the Pontic steppe in the 18th century: in 1718 the Russian Tsar Peter I issued decrees overseeing the collection of &quot;right old and rare&quot; objects to Saint Petersburg in exchange for compensation, and the material thus obtained became the basis of the Saint Petersburg State Hermitage Museum&#x27;s collection of Scythian gold. This resulted in significant grave robbery of Scythian burials, due to which most of the Scythian tombs of the Russian Empire had been sacked by 1764.

In the 19th century, Scythian kurgans in Ukraine, Kuban, and Crimea had been looted, so that by the 20th century, more than 85% of Scythian kurgans excavated by archaeologists had already been pillaged. The grave robbers of the 18th and 19th centuries were experienced enough that they almost always found the burial chambers of the tombs and stole the treasures contained within them.

=====Russian Scythianism=====

In the later 19th century, a cultural movement called () emerged in Russia whose members unreservedly referred to themselves and to Russians as a whole as (). Closely affiliated to the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, the were a movement of Russian nationalist religious mysticists who saw Russia as a sort of Messiah-like figure who would usher in a new historical era of the world, and their identification with the ancient Scythians was a positive acceptance of Dostoevsky&#x27;s view that Europe had always seen Russians as being Asiatic. The therefore used this image to distinguish Russia from the West, although they nevertheless did not see Russia as being a part of Asia, and their ideas were instead a revival of the old conceptualisation of Russia as being the bridge linking Europe and Asia.
The culmination of was the famous poem written in 1918 by Aleksandr Blok, titled (), in which he presented &quot;Scythia,&quot; that is Russia, as being different from the rest of Asia while also being closer to Europe. In , Blok depicted Russia as a barrier between the &quot;warring races&quot; of Europe and Asia, and he made use of the racist Yellow Peril ideology by threatening that Russia was capable of stopping its &quot;protection&quot; of Europe and allow East Asians to overrun it.

The scholar Adrienne Mayor hypothesised over the course of 1993 to 2011 that the legend of the griffin originated among the Scythians, who came across fossilised skeletons of the dinosaur  in Mongolia while mining for gold, and retold this discovery to the ancient Greeks, who interpreted them as mythical beings, thus creating the myth of the griffin. This hypothesis was contested by the palaeontologist Mark P. Witton, who argued that the imagery of the griffin originated in early Bronze Age West Asia and was transmitted from there into ancient Greek art during the Orientalising period. The imagery of griffins in Scythian art itself was borrowed from the artistic traditions of West Asia and ancient Greece.

The scholar David Anthony has also hypothesised that the martial role of women among Scytho-Sarmatians had given rise to the Greek myths about Amazons. However, according to the Scythologist Askold Ivantchik, the imagery of the Amazons was already known to Homer and was originally unrelated to the Scythians, with the link between Scythians and Amazons in Greek literature beginning only later in the 5th century BC.

== Culture and society ==

The Scythians were a member of the broader cultures of nomadic Iranic peoples living throughout the Eurasian steppe and possessed significant commonalities with them, such as similar weapons, horse harnesses and &quot;Animal Style&quot; art.

The Scythians were a people from the Eurasian steppe, whose conditions required them to be pastoralists, which required mobility to find natural pastures, which in turn shaped every aspect of the Scythian nomads&#x27; lives, ranging from the structure of their habitations and the style of their clothing to how they cooked.

This nomadic culture depended on a self-sufficient economy whose own resources could provide for its sustainance, and whose central component was the horse, which could be used peacefully to barter for commodities and services or belligerently in a form of warfare which provided nomadic fighters superiority until the creation of firearms.

Since the Scythians did not have a written language, their non-material culture can only be pieced together through writings by non-Scythian authors, parallels found among other Iranic peoples, and archaeological evidence.

===Location===
====Early phase in the western steppes====
After migrating out of Central Asia and into the western steppes, the Scythians first settled and established their kingdom in the area between the Araxes, the Caucasus Mountains and the Maeotian Sea.

====In West Asia====
In West Asia, the Scythians initially settled in the area between the Araxes and Kura rivers before further expanding into the region to the south of the Kuros river in what is present-day Azerbaijan, where they settled around what is today Mingəçevir, Gəncə and the Muğan plain, and Transcaucasia remained their centre of operations in West Asia until the early 6th century BC, although this presence in West Asia remained an extension of the Scythian kingdom of the steppes, and the Scythian kings&#x27; headquarters were instead located in the Ciscaucasian steppes.

During the peak of the Scythians&#x27; power in West Asia after they had conquered Media, Mannai and Urartu and defeated the Cimmerians, the Scythian kingdom&#x27;s possessions in the region consisted of a large area extending from the Halys river in Anatolia in the west to the Caspian Sea and the eastern borders of Media in the east, and from Transcaucasia in the north to the northern borders of the Neo-Assyrian Empire in the south.

====In the Pontic steppe====

The territory of the Pontic Scythians extended across the Pontic steppe from the Don river in the east to the Danube river in the west and the Prut river in the northwest. To the south, the territory of the Scythians included the steppe regions of Crimea and the Black Sea Lowland, and it was bounded in this direction by the Black and Maeotian Seas from the mouths of the Istros to the Tanais rivers.

To the north of the steppe proper were the forest steppes, which covered the area of the Dnipro hills, the middle reaches of the Dnipro river itself, and stretched from part of the Dnipro Lowland up to the middle Don river. The characteristic features of the forest steppe were the large forest tracts and woodless tracts of meadow steppe.

The Scythian kingdom covered the territory of the treeless steppe immediately north of the Black Sea&#x27;s coastline, which was inhabited by nomadic pastoralists, as well as the fertile black-earth forest steppe area to the north of the treeless steppe, which was inhabited by an agricultural population, and the northern border of this Scythian kingdom were the mixed deciduous woodlands laying to the north of the forest steppe.

Until the late 6th century BC, the Scythians&#x27; territory also included the Ciscaucasian steppe around the Kuban river, although by the 5th century BC the Scythian kingdom no longer included Ciscaucasia and had become limited by the Don river to its east.

Several rivers flowed southwards across this region and emptied themselves into the Black Sea, of which the largest one was the Borysthenēs (Dnipro), which was the richest river in Scythia, with most of the fish living in it, and the best pastures and most fertile lands being located on its banks, while its water was the cleanest; due to this, the Borysthenēs was the central axis of Scythia, and Graeco-Roman authors compared it to the Nile in Egypt. Other important rivers of Scythia were the:
* Istros (Danube),
* Tyras (Dnister),
* Hypanis (Southern Buh),
* Panticapes (Inhulets),
* Hypacyris (Kalanchak),
* Gerrhus (either Molochna or Konka),
* and Tanais (Don).

=====Climate=====
The Pontic Steppe at this time was dominated by a temperate climate, with cold winters and summers which were warmer, wetter and damper compared to present-day Ukraine, due to which Graeco-Roman writers wrote exaggerated reports claiming that Scythia was either eternally cold and covered in frost or damp and foggy.

Pontic Scythia was part of the Eurasian Steppe and was therefore covered by a largely treeless grassland inhabited by the pastoralist nomadic tribes. To the north of the steppe was a forest steppe zone growing on a distinctly fertile type of black soil, which was inhabited by an agricultural population, and was itself was bordered on the north by mixed coniferous woodlands, then the coniferous taiga, and finally the treeless tundra.

Beginning in the 9th century BC, the climate of the Pontic Steppe became cooler and drier, which led various nomadic groups to move into the forest steppe and the northern foothills of the Caucasus to search for better pastures. By the 5th cenury BC, the climate became warmer and wetter, allowing the nomads to move southwards into the steppe itself.

This wetter and damper environment of the Sub-Atlantic climate was very favourable for settlement in the 1st millennium BC, with the boundary between the steppe and forest steppe being further to the south than the present one, and there was abundance of grass thanks to which the nomads could rear large herds of horses and cattle.

The region within the Scythian Pontic realm which was covered with forests was named by the Greeks as the country of (), and consisted of the region of the lower Dnipro river along the territory of what is modern-day Kherson.

In these favourable climatic conditions, the ranges of beavers and elk extended further south than presently, with beavers then being present in the lower Dnipro and lower Southern Buh river valleys, and elk living until the environs of Olbia, and the bones both these animals have been found in kitchen refuse dating from the Scythian period.

=====Neighbouring populations=====
The neighbours of the Scythians in the Pontic Steppe included:
* the Thracian Getae, who lived to the west of Scythia, across the Danube and Pyretos rivers.
* the Melanchlaeni and the Androphagi, who lived to the east of the middle Dnipro river, in the forest steppe bordering the territory of the Royal Scythians to the north, respectively in the valleys of the Donets and Sula rivers. These populations were either of Scythic or of mixed Scythic and native origin.
* the Sauromatians, who lived to the east of the Scythians, in the steppe between the Don and the Volga, were another Scythic people. They were the immediate neighbours of the Royal Scythians to the east, across the Don river.
* the Neuri, who were a Baltic population of the region of the forest steppe corresponding to modern-day Belarus, lived to the north of the Aroteres. They corresponded to the Milograd culture.
* the Agathyrsi lived to the west of the Aroteres and of the Neuri.
* the Budini, to the east of the Neuroi and in the valley of the Vorskla river, were either a Scythic tribe, or one of the many Finno-Ugric populations living in the eastern forest steppe until the Ural Mountains.
* the Gelonians, to the east of the Dnipro, in the valley of the Vorskla river.
* the Maeotians lived on the eastern coast of the Maeotian Sea.
* the Tauri lived in the Crimean Mountains.

====Little Scythia====
After the 3rd century BC, Scythian territory became restricted to two small states, each called &quot;Little Scythia,&quot; respectively located in Dobruja and Crimea:
*in Dobruja, the Scythian kingdom&#x27;s territory stretched from Tyras or even Pontic Olbia in the north to Odessus in the south;
*in Crimea, the Scythian kingdom covered a limited a territory which included the steppes and foothills of the Tauric Chersonese until Taurida, the lower Borysthenēs, and the lower Hypanis rivers.

===Ethnicity===
====Central Asian Iranic origins====
The originally nomadic Scythians who migrated out of Central Asia were an Eastern Iranic people who shared a common language, origins and culture with the Iranic nomads of the Chernogorovka-Novocherkassk complex, such as the Cimmerians.

This origin from Central Asia, which was also ultimately the case with other Iranic peoples such as the Medes, Persians, Parthians, and Sogdians, was visible until at least the 5th century BC in how these various peoples shared common myths as well as styles of dress and ornaments such as the wearing of tunics and trousers.

====Later tribal confederation====
Within the Pontic Steppe, the incoming Scythian conquerors became known as the Royal Scythians after establishing themselves as the ruling elite over the local population and assimilating them into a single tribal identity while allowing them to continue their various lifestyles and economic organisations, so that not all populations of Pontic Scythia were themselves Scythians, with some being under Scythian hegemony and others being independent.

The consequence of this political structure under the suzerainty of the Royal Scythians was many of the non-Scythian populations of the Pontic Steppe becoming designated by the term &quot;&quot; largely because they lived under the domination of the Iranic Scythian ruling class.

====Constituent tribes====
The population of the North Pontic Scythian kingdom was a complex political structure composed of both Scythian and non-Scythian peoples:
*the Scythians proper, who were a group of Iranic nomadic pastoralist tribes, were located primarily in the steppe regions of the northern Tauric Chersonese and in the steppes of eastern Scythia, to the north of the Maeotian Sea, and between the rivers Tanais and Borysthenēs for the Royal Scythians, and between the Borysthenēs and the Hypanis for the Nomad Scythians;
*various Proto-Slavic and Thracian sedentary farmer tribes populations between the Borysthenēs and the Istros;
**the populations in the forest-steppes Borysthenēs-Hypanis interfluve were Proto-Slavs, while those in the region of the Pyretos and southern Borysthenēs rivers were Thracians;
**some of these sedentary farmers later moved into the Tauric Chersonese.
The Borysthenēs river thus marked a cultural boundary between the sedentary farmers in the west and the pastoral nomads in the east: these various populations constituting the overarching Scythian political structure were furthermore organised into tribes which were themselves headed by local lords. These tribes were in turn subject to the dominant tribe of the Royal Scythians, who formed the tribal aristocracy of the Scythians and whose ruling lord was the king of all Scythians.

The Scythians were composed of a number of tribal units, including:
* the Royal Scythians were an Iranic tribe who nomadised in the Pontic Steppe, in an area limited by the Dnipro river in the west, and the Don river and the port of Krēmnoi in the east, as well in the Tauric Chersonese up to the Cimmerian Bosporus in its east. Herodotus of Halicarnassus called them the &quot;bravest of the Scythian tribes.&quot;
**The Royal Scythians were the main Scythian tribe as well as the ruling dominant tribe of the whole of Scythia to whom all the other tribes were subjects, with the high king of all the Scythians coming from the tribe of the Royal Scythians.
***the various tribes being each led by their own lords were all subservient to the lord of the Royal Scythians, and they all paid tribute to the Royal Scythians and provided them and the high king with servants.
** the Royal Scythians were also known by two other names:
*** ( (Scythian: ) corresponds to the Young Avestan name (), meaning &quot;placed at the front.&quot;
*** () is the Greek form of the Scythian endonym , formed by the addition of the plural suffix to the Scythian endonym 
** The Royal Scythians and the Nomad Scythians were the only fully nomadic tribes within Scythia.
* the Nomad Scythians, who lived to the west of the Royal Scythians, between the Inhul and the bend of the Dnipro, were a mixed Thracian and Iranic Scythian nomadic tribe. The Nomad Scythians and the Royal Scythians were the only fully nomadic tribes in Scythia.
* the Free Scythians, who were a tribe of mixed Scythian-Sauromatian origin, lived in the southeastern Pontic Steppe, between the port of Krēmnoi and the Don or the Donets river.
* the &#x27; () or &#x27; (), who were the westernmost Scythian tribe, were semi-nomads who occupied the steppe between the Inhul and the Dnister around the region where the Dnister and the Southern Buh flow the closest to each other.
**The Alazones led semi-nomadic lives, with those of them who lived in the steppe being pastoral nomads and those who lived in the valleys of the Southern Buh and nearby rivers being farmers who cultivated wheat, onions, garlic, lentils and millet. The were the southern neighbours of the Aroteres and, like them, might have been of mixed Thracian and Iranic origins. The were themselves in turn the northern neighbours of the Callipidae.
* the Scythian Ploughmen or Scythian Husbandmen, or () who were the northern neighbours of the Alazones, were sedentary agriculturists who lived in a region with fertile black earth corresponding to the modern-day part of Ukraine which lies to the west of the Dnipro river until the region of Vinnytsia. Their neighbours to the north were the Baltic Neuri, and to the south were the Alazones.
** The Aroteres were large sedentary Thracian or proto-Slavic population of Scythia who descended from the Late Bronze Age Chernoles Culture, over whom had established themselves an Iranic Scythian ruling class during the 6th century BC.
* the Callipidae () were a semi-nomadic population of mixed Greek-Scythian origin who lived across a wide section of land adjacent to the shores of the Black sea ranging from the estuary of the Southern Buh river to the area of modern-day Odesa or even until the estuary of the Dnister. The western neighbours of the Callipadae across the Dnister river were Thracian tribe of the Getae in Bessarabia, while Thracian populations under Scythian rule lived on the coast. Their northern neighbours were the .
**The Callipidae were a considerably Hellenised tribe consisting of a large settled Thracian population with a Scythian ruling class who had significantly intermarried with Greek settlers.
* the Scythian Agriculturalists or () were another population of Thracian origin. The lived in the valley of the lower Dnipro river, in the wooded country of , and they may have been sedendary or semi-nomadic.
* a tribe not named by the Greek authors lived on the north-west shore of the Maeotian Sea, and corresponded to the archaeological &quot;Obytichna 12 type&quot; settlements.
Of the many tribes constituting the Scythian kingdom, the nomadic tribes lived on the steppes immediately to the north of the Maeotian Sea and on the right and left banks of the Borysthenēs river.

In addition to the Scythians themselves, as well as the Thracians who had inhabited the region since the Bronze Age, the population of the Pontic Scythian kingdom consisted of Greeks living in colonies on the northern shore of the Black Sea.

There were initially few differences within the many Scythian tribes and tribal groupings in the early period of the Pontic Scythian kingdom, which later became more pronounced as these eventually conquered various native populations.

====Related populations====
The Scythians were closely related to other Iranic nomads who occupied the Eurasian steppe during Antiquity, such as:
*the Cimmerians of the Caspian Steppe;
*the Sauromatians of the Volga-Ural region;
*the Saka of Central Asia, including:
**the Massagetae around the Oxus and the Aral Sea;
**other Saka groups in the steppe and montane steppe of what is presently East Kazakhstan;
**the Pazyryk culture in what is presently the Altai Republic;
**the Tagar culture in the Minusinsk Hollow;
**the Aldy-Bel and Sagly cultures in Tuva;
**the Chandman culture on the northern and central Mongolian Plateau;
*the Yuezhi.

These various steppe nomads were themselves members of the eastern group of Iranic peoples, whose other member populations included the Bactrians, the Chorasmians, and the Sogdians, while the western group of Iranic peoples included the Medes, Parthians and Persians.

These common Iranic origins of Medes, Persians, Parthians, Scythians and Sogdians were visible until at least the 5th century BC in how these various peoples shared common myths as well as styles of dress and ornaments.

===Language===

The Scythians as well as the Saka of Central Asia spoke a group of languages belonging to the Iranic family, more specifically to the eastern branch of the Iranic language family.

A specific feature of the language of the Pontic Scythians was the transformation of the sound /δ/ () into .

The Scythian languages may have formed a dialect continuum: &quot;Scytho-Sarmatian&quot; in the west and &quot;Scytho-Khotanese&quot; or Saka in the east. The Scythian languages were mostly marginalised and assimilated as a consequence of the late antiquity and early Middle Ages Slavic and Turkic expansions. The western (Sarmatian) group of ancient Scythian survived as the medieval language of the Alans and eventually gave rise to the modern Ossetian language.

===Social organisation===
====Class system====

Scythian society was stratified along class lines. Herodotus of Halicarnassus named the three classes of Scythians only once in his writings, where he described them as descended from the three sons of the Scythian ancestor-god Targitaos:
* the Auchatae (), who were the priestly class, descended from Targitaos&#x27;s eldest son, Lipoxais, occupied the middle position;
* the Catiari () and Traspies (), who were the farmer-and-peasant class, descended from Targitaos&#x27;s middle son, Arpoxais, and occupied the lowest social position;
* the Royal Scythians, also called the Scoloti () and the Paralatae (), who were the warrior-aristocracy, descended from Targitaos&#x27;s youngest son, Kolaxais, occupied the highest social position and dominated the other two classes, with the Scythian kings belonging to this dominant class.

By the 5th to 4th centuries BC, the Scythian population was stratified into five different class groups:
#the aristocracy;
#very wealthy commoners;
#moderately wealthy commoners;
#the peasantry, who were the producer class and formed the mass of the populace;
#the poor.

=====The aristocracy=====
The Scythian aristocracy were an elite class dominating all aspects of Scythian life consisting of property owners who possessed landed estates large enough that it sometimes took a whole day to ride around them. These freeborn Scythian rulers used the whip as their symbol.

The burials of the deceased from the aristocracy and royalty were the largest ones, varying from 14 to 21 metres in height, and were the most elaborate and luxurouusly-equipped ones: their contents included between 3 and 11 human sacrifices, between 4 and 16 horse sacrifices, the presence of gold on the horse harnesses, and the lavishness and large range of the grave goods.

The Scythian kings, especially, were buried along with servants, cupbearers, grooms, and their entourage from their subordinate tribes, who were killed when the king died and buried in his grave to follow him in the afterlife.

=====Commoners=====
The commoners were free but still depended to some extent on the aristocracy. They were allowed to own some property, usually a pair of oxen needed to pull a cart, hence why they were called () in Greek. By the 4th century BC, the economic exploitation of these free commoners became the main economic policy of Scythia.

Within this system of commoner dependency on the aristocrats and royalty, these elite classes rewarded their dependants&#x27; loyalty through presents consisting of metal products whose manufacture was overseen by the elites themselves in the industrial centre located in the Scythian capital city at Kamianka.

The burials of these commoners were largely simple, and contained simpler furnishings and fewer grave goods, although the tombs of commoner warriors could contain weapons, horse gear and sometimes a horse as well.

The commoners were buried in fewer kurgans compared to the upper classes, and were sometimes instead inhumated as the sacrificed retinue of in secondary burials of Scythian aristocrats. Similarly, the commoner buried in one of the smaller barrows around the Solokha royal kurgan belonged to a warrior accompanied with five horses, but did not contain much wealth

=====Serfdom=====
Serfs belonged to the poorest sections of the native populations of Scythia, and, being tied to the land and not possessing cattle, they were not free and did not own cattle or wagons. Stablemen and farmers were recruited from the serf class.

=====Slavery=====
Although Scythian society was not dependent on slavery, A rudimentary form of it was nevertheless practised in Scythia according to which slaves performed only domestic tasks.

However, the Scythian ruling class nevertheless still used a large number of slaves to till the land and tend to the cattle. Slaves were also assigned to the production of dairy products. The Greek author Herodotus of Halicarnassus claimed that the Scythians used to blind their slaves to prevent them from eating the most valuable of these dairy products. He also claimed that the Scythian kings considered the inhabitants of Crimea to be their slaves.

=====Class hierarchies=====
The class stratification of Scythian society corresponded to a hierarchy of social standing and property ownership which is visible in how export of the grain cultivated by the common freemen profited only the aristocracy but not these commoners, whose graves lacked the lavish furnishing of the aristocratic burials, although rings, clothing plaques and gold-covered wood handles could still be present in their burials.

This drastic difference between the aristocracy and the commoners is also visible in how Scythian art only represented the interested of the Scythian ruling classes.

====Clan structures====
Scythian society was constituted of kinship structures where clan groups formed the basis of the community and of political organisation.

Clan elders wielded considerable power, and were able to depose kings, such as when the Scythian army overthrew the king Scyles and the Scythians demanded his extradition from the Thracians, after which he was executed. Following the deposition of Scyles, the power of both the king and the warrior-aristocracy became further entrenched.

As an extension of clan-based relations, a custom of blood brotherhood existed among the Scythians, whereby the blood of the sworn blood brothers was poured in a cup of wine in which their swords, arrows, battle-aces, and spears were lowered before they drank it.

====Gender roles====
=====Patriarchy=====
Scythian society was a patriarchal one where women were subordinate to men, although women from the upper classes were free to ride horses, while women from the lower classes may have not been free to do so and may have spent most of their time indoors. Among the more nomadic tribes, the women and children spent most of their time indoors in the wagons, with Herodotus of Halicarnassus having recorded that women held a higher status among the Sauromatians than among the Scythians.

With immigration into Scythia in the late 6th century BC of a wave of Sauromatians, among whom women held high social status, the standing of women improved in Scythian society enough that they were allowed to become warriors as from the Middle Scythian period.

=====Marriage customs=====
Polygamy was practised among the Scythian upper classes, and kings had harems in which both local women and woman who had been bought lived. Some of these women were the kings&#x27; legal wives and others were their concubines. After the deaths of Scythian men, their main wives or concubines would be killed and buried alongside them.

Reflecting the patriarchal structure of Scythian society, the wives and concubines could be passed down as inheritance, as when the Scythian king Scyles married Opoea, who had been one of his father&#x27;s wives.

=====Gender non-conformity=====
Within Scythian priesthood there existed a group of transgender soothsayers, called the  (), who were born and lived their early lives as men, and later in their lives assumed the mannerisms and social roles role of women.

====Administrative structure====
The Scythians, like the Cimmerians, were organised into a tribal nomadic state with its own territorial boundaries, and comprising both pastoralist and urban elements. Such nomadic states were managed by institutions of authority presided over by the rulers of the tribes, the warrior aristocracy, and ruling dynasty.

=====Kingship=====
The Scythians were monarchical, and the king of all the Scythians was the main tribal chief, who was from the dominant tribe of the Royal Scythians.

Power among the Scythian kings was passed down a single dynasty, and the historian and anthropologist Anatoly Khazanov has suggested that the Scythians had been ruled by the same dynasty from the time of their stay in West Asia until the end of their kingdom in the Pontic Steppe, while the Scythologist Askold Ivantchik has instead proposed that the Scythians had been ruled by at least three dynasties, including that of Bartatua, that of Spargapeithes, and that of Ariapeithes.

Although the kings&#x27; powers were limited by the popular and warrior assemblies, royal power itself was held among the Scythians to be divinely ordained: this conception of royal power, which is well documented in the ritual symbols depicted on 5th to 3rd century BC Scythian toreutics, was initially foreign to Scythian culture and originated in West Asia during the period of Scythian presence there in the 7th century BC.

The Scythian kings were later able to further increase their position through the concentration of economic power in their hands because of their dominance of the grains trade with the Greeks, which made them and the Scythian warrior-aristocracy as a whole, very wealthy.

After their death, the Scythian kings were buried along with one or some of their wives. The kings also chose servants, cupbearers, courtiers, and members of the royal entourage from the tribes under his authority, who were to be killed and buried along with him to follow and serve him in the afterlife. Warriors belonging to the entourage of Scythian rulers were also buried in smaller and less magnificent tombs surrounding the tombs of the rulers.

By the 4th century BC, the Scythian kingdom had developed into a rudimentary state after the king Ateas had united all the Scythian tribes under his personal authority.

=====Popular and warrior assemblies=====
The Scythians were organised into popular and warrior assemblies that limited the power of the kings. The gatherings of these assemblies were held in the nomes, such as the one at which the overthrow of the king Scyles was decided.

=====Dependancy=====
Scythian aristocrats had dependants: these could be lower-class Scythians, to whom they offered metal products as rewards for their loyalty, or Greeks, from whom they obtained gifts such as objects made of precious metals.

=====Administrative divisions=====
The Scythians were ruled by a triple monarchy, with a high king who ruled all of the Scythian kingdom, and two younger kings who ruled in sub-regions. The kingdom composed of three kingdoms which were in turn made of nomes headed by local lords, not unlike the Great Chiefs of ancient Egypt and the Satraps of the Achaemenid Empire.

Ceremonies were held in each nome on a yearly basis.

The Scythians thus possessed a complex political organisation arising from their agro-pastoralist lifestyle and economy. Such structures were also present among:
*the ancient Xiongnu, where a supreme ruler presided over several commanders and governors who ruled over different districts at various locations;
*and the late nomadic Huns, who possessed a complex system of sub-kings and a complex bureaucracy who served the supreme king.

===Economy===
Within the Pontic Steppe, the incoming Scythian conquerors established themselves as the ruling elite over the local population and assimilated them into a single tribal identity while allowing them to continue their various lifestyles and economic organisations.

The peoples of Scythia were thus agro-pastoralists consisting of a mix of sedentary farmer populations and nomads, with the tribes living in the steppes remaining primarily nomadic and having lifestyles and customs inextricably linked to their nomadic way of life.

The dominant tribe of the Royal Scythians, especially, originally led a transhumant warrior-pastoralist nomadic way of life by spending the summer northwards in the steppes and moving southwards towards the coasts in the winter.

With the integration of Scythia with the Greek colonies on the northern shore of the Black Sea, the Scythians also soon became involved in activities such as cultivating grain, fishing, trading and craftsmanship.

====Pastoralism====
The Scythians practised animal husbandry, and their society was highly based on nomadic pastoralism, which was practised by both the sedendary and nomadic Scythian tribes, with their herds being made up of about 40% horses, 40% cattle, and 18% sheep, but no pigs, which the Scythians refused to keep in their lands. Horse rearing was especially an important part of Scythian life, not only because the Scythians rode them, but also because horses were a source of food.

During the 1st millennium BC, the wet and damp climate prevailing in the Pontic Steppe constituted a propitious environment which caused grass to grow in abundance, in turn allowing the Scythians to rear large herds of horse and cattle.

Scythian pastoralism followed seasonal rhythm, moving closer to the shores of the Maeotian Sea in winter and back to the steppe in summer, with the grazing location often changing due to the herds and flocks moving on to search for new pastures once the already occupied pastures had been grazed. The Scythians appear to have not stored food for their animals, who therefore likely foraged under the snow during winter.

The strong reliance of the Scythians on pastoralism itself ensured the self-sufficiency of the Scythians, and was conducive towards the nomadic lifestyle. This importance of pastoralism for the Scythians is visible in how representations of pastoral activities formed the predominant theme of Scythian petroglyphic art.

The nomadic Scythians were able to rear large flocks and herds because of the grass growing abundantly on the treeless steppe thanks to the propitious climate then prevailing to the north of the Black Sea, and they especially grew barley to provide feed for their animals.

====Hunting====
Hunting among the Scythians was primarily done for sport and entartainment rather than for procuring meat, although it was occasionally also carried out for food.

====Agriculture====
Conditions in the southern lands near the shores of the Black Sea, such as in Hylaea and the valleys further north along the Dnipro, were propitious for agriculture and for cultivating cereals, orchards and vineyards. In addition to the sedentary Scythian tribes, the nomadic Scythians themselves also complemented their mobile pastoralism with agriculture.

The settlements in the valley of the Borysthenēs river especially grew wheat, millet, and barley, which grew abundantly thanks to the fertile black soil of the steppe. This allowed the Scythians to, in addition of being principally reliant on domesticated animals, also complement their source of food with agriculture, and the Scythian upper classes owned large estates in which large numbers of slaves and members of the tribes subordinate to the Royal Scythians were used to till the land and rear cattle.

Among the tribes subordinate to the nomadic Iranic Scythian, the sedendary Scythian tribes of the Callipidae, Aroteres, Georgoi, and Alizones, engaged in agriculture, and grew crops for their own use as well as to be exported to the Greeks on the northern shores of the Black Sea. These tribes were able to cultivate large quantities of crops thanks to the use of wooden ploughs. The ancient Greek author Herodotus of Halicarnassus recorded that these sedendary Scythian tribes grew wheat, barley, millet, lentils, beans, onions, and garlic; and an oven used to dry grains of wheat, barley, and rye was located at the site of Shyroka Balka, near Pontic Olbia.

The Callipidae cultivated crops including wheat and millet, and also engaged in animal husbandry and fishing at sea.

====Crafts and materials====
Aside from the consumed milk and meat, other parts of the animals reared by the Scythians were used to make skins and wool:
*felts made of sheep&#x27;s wool and sewn sheepskins were used to make caps and tents;
*wool, hide, and fur was used to make clothing and blankets;
*leather was used to make armour, helmets, trousers, shoes, pendants, velts, and quivers;
*horse hair was used to make ropes used to cut animals from the herds and tether, laden, and bridle them;
*hemp from cannabis plants was used to make lariats used to herd horses and lassoes used in warfare;
*bone was a light and accessible material:
**bone was easily worked into many types of tools and ornaments;
**bone was also used as fuel because it produced higher temperatures when burnt.

The native sedentary Thracians populations who lived in Scythia manufactured products such as pottery, woodwork, and weaving, as well as bronze metal-working made out of raw materials imported from Transylvania. From this practice of handicraft, the peoples of Scythia obtained simple tools and ornaments, as well as certain types of weapons:
*wood was a light, important, and accessible material:
**it was easy to work into many types of tools and ornaments, such as spear shafts, arrows, battle-axes, tools, composite bows, ploughs, wagons, tents, and other objects used in daily life;
**it was also used as fuel;
**wood was obtained from the extensive woodlands on the well-watered lands of the lower Dnipro;

=====Metalworking=====

The populations of Scythia practised both metal casting and blacksmithing, with the same craftsmen usually both casting copper and bronze and forging iron:
*cast bronze bronze and iron were used to produce weapons and heavy tools;
*Scythian bronze-working products included:
**large bronze semi-spheric cauldrons with truncated cones as their stands, and which were decorated in cast and had either two or four animal-shaped handles on their rims;
**socketed bronze finials which were placed at the top of poles and decorated with various animal figures;
*The ores from which copper and tin were smelted were likely mined in the region of the Donets Ridge, and metal might also have been imported from the Ural Mountains and the Caucasus. Iron was meanwhile smelted out of bog iron ores obtained from the swampy regions on the lower Dnipro.

The Scythians and the peoples of the Pontic steppe were still Bronze Age societies until the 8th century BC, and it was only after the Scythians had expanded into West Asia that they acquired knowledge of ironworking, which they then brought with them into the Pontic Steppe after they had been expelled from West Asia around .

=====Goldsmithing=====
The Scythians had practised goldsmithing from an early date, with remains from the 2nd Aržan kurgan attesting that the Scythians were already skilled in working gold before their migration out of Central Asia. This tradition of goldsmithing continued until the times of the Pontic Scythian kingdom.

======Industrial organisation======
The metallurgical workshops which produced the weapons and horse harnesses of the Scythians during the Early Scythian period were located in the forest steppe, with the centre of industry at that time being located in the region of the Tiasmyn group of the Scythian culture, which corresponded the country of the Arotēres, where an Iranic Scythian elite ruled over a sedentary Thracian population.

By the Middle Scythian period, its principal centre was at a site corresponding to present-day Kamianka, where bog iron ores from the Kryvyi Rih region were smelted and forged to produce iron, and various tools, ornaments, and weapons were made: the whole process of manufacturing iron, from the initial smelting to the final forging, were carried out there Other metals, such as copper, lead, and zinc were also smelted at Kamianka, while gold- and silversmiths also worked there. This large-scale industrial operation consumed large amounts of timber which was obtained from the river valleys of Scythia, and metalworking might have developed at Kamianka because timber was available nearby.

Kamianka was the location where the Scythian king oversaw metal production on an industrial scale: some of the city&#x27;s products were used by the Scythian aristocracy itself or offered by them to their dependants and their descendants in exchange for their loyalty; and Kamianka appears to have also been the main supplier of metal items, especially made of iron and bronze, to the Scythian nomads living in the steppes; meanwhile, the surplus of the metal was turned into ingots and shipped to Pontic Olbia to be traded.

=====Textiles=====
Textiles used to produce Scythian garments included

The Scythians manufactured textiles using spindles, and wool, hemp, ramie, and mixed fibres that were made into cloth through plain, twill and tapestry weaving, while silk appears to have been imported from China.

====Trade====
The Pontic Scythians practised trade extensively, with the substantial trade relations existed between the Scythians and the Greeks which continued the long-established exchanges of goods between the northern Pontic and Aegean region that had already existed since the 3rd and 2nd millennia BC. These trade relations became more intense after the Greeks established colonies on the shores of the Black Sea, as a consequence of which the Scythians engaged in trade with both European and Asian Greece.

The ancient Greeks had first been starting to make expeditions in the Black Sea in the 8th century BC, and encounters with friendly native populations quickly stimulated trade relations and the development of more regular commercial transits. The first Greek colonies of the north coast of the Black Sea attempted to develop trade with its native populations, and therefore they had set up trading enclaves (; ) in the 7th century BC. These colonies were themselves useful for the commercial ventures of their mother cities by acting as markets through which manufactured goods could be exchanged with the native populations in exchange for foodstuffs and rare raw materials such as metals, furs, and slaves brought through the inland trading networks.

The location of the Scythians in the Pontic Steppe had thus placed them in an extremely advantageous position:
*to the north, in the forest steppe, lived large settled farmer populations who produced a large variety of highly sought-after commodities such as iron, charcoal, furs, honey, slaves, and grain;
*to the south, on the north shore of the Black Sea, were the Greek colonies which were seeking raw materials and manpower for their own use, as well as to export to Greece.
This situation therefore allowed the Scythian kingdom to mediate the thriving trade that the Greek colonies to their south were carrying out with the sedentary peoples of the forest steppe to their north, and which was carried out via the large rivers of the Scythian steppe flowing southwards into the Black Sea, which formed the main access routes to these northern markets.

====Scythian exports====
The Scythians exported iron, grain and slaves to the Greek colonies, and animal products, grain, fish, honey, wax, forest products, furs, skins, wood, horses, cattle, sheep, and slaves to mainland Greece on both sides of the Aegean Sea. Also sold to the Greeks by the Scythians were beavers and beaver-skins, and rare furs that the Scythians had themselves bought from the populations living to their north and east such as the Thyssagetae and Iurcae of the Ural Mountains who hunted rare animals and sewed their skins into clothing.

Other Scythian exports to Greece included various metals smelted from ores and processed into ingots by the Scythians themselves at their industrial centre in their capital city of Kamianka. Ingots of these metals were shipped down the rivers of Scythia till Pontic Olbia, where they were sold to the Greeks.

The Greeks were also especially interested in buying Scythian horses, and in the mid-6th century BC the Greeks started employing Scythian mercenaries in the form of detachments of mounted archers to support their own hoplite armies.

=====The grain trade=====
The most important of these export goods was grain, and most especially wheat, with the Scythians on the lower Dnipro river cultivating crops principally for export, and the tribes of the Callipidae, Aroteres, Georgoi, and Alizones selling part of their large crop yields to the Greeks; an oven used to dry grain such as wheat, barley, and rye, was located at Shyroka Balka.

======Athenian commercial ventures======
The importance of the Greek colonies of the north Black Sea coast drastically increased in the later 6th century BC following the Persian Empire&#x27;s conquest of Egypt, which deprived the states of Greece proper of the Egyptian grain that they depended on. These grain supplies were so important to the city-states of Greece, most especially of the then dominant Greek power of Athens, that this latter city started seeking new locations for producing grain on the north shore of the Black Sea. Therefore, Athens established very well defended new colonies on the north Black Sea coast near the already existing settlements which would act as sites where grain of very good quality was produced to be exported to Athens to feed its citizenry.

======Scythian-managed grain trade======
The relations between the Scythians and the Greek colonies became more hostile in the early 5th century BC, with the Scythians destroying the Greek cities&#x27; and rural settlements, and therefore their grain-producing hinterlands. The result was that the Scythians instituted an economic policy under their control whereby the sedentary peoples of the forest steppe to their north became the primary producers of grain, which was then transported through the Buh and Dnipro rivers to the Greek cities to their south such as Tyras, Niconium and Pontic Olbia, from where the cities exported it to mainland Greece at a profit for themselves.

The Scythian monopoly over the trade of grain imported from the forest steppe to the Greek cities came to an end sometime between 435 and 400 BC, after which the Greek cities regained their independence and rebuilt their .

======Bosporan grain trade======
Beginning in the 5th century BC, the grain trade with Greece was carried out through the intermediary of the Bosporan kingdom, due to which the Scythians expanded their agricultural activities to the areas adjoining the Bosporan Kingdom, including in Crimea, resulting in some of the sedentary Scythian farmers moving into Crimea so as to cultivate their crops in close proximity to these clients. As a consequence of the Peloponnesian War, the Bosporan Kingdom became the main supplier of grain to Greece in the 4th century BC, which resulted in an increase of the trade of grain between the Scythians and the Bosporans.

======Scythian profits======
The Scythian aristocracy played an important role in this grain trade by becoming the main intermediary in providing grain, obtained both through from the agriculturalist peoples of the forest steppe and cultivation within Scythia itself, to the Bosporan Kingdom. The Scythian aristocracy was the main beneficiary of these commercial activities, from which it derived immense revenue and was able to significantly enrich itself, hence why it sought to increase the amount of grain produced in Scythia.

The rich aristocratic burials richly furnished with imported grave goods and gold silver objects, including fine Greek-made toreutics and jewellery, attest of the Scythian aristocracy&#x27;s economic power derived from the grain trade, due to which the coins minted by Scythian kings at Pontic Olbia were struck with depictions of ears of grain. Scythian commoners did however not obtain any benefits from this trade, and luxury goods were absent from their tombs.

Inscriptions from the Greek cities on the northern Black Sea coast also show that upper class Greek families also derived wealth from this trade, and as a consequence of these flourishing trade relations, which were themselves possible only thanks to the protection and cooperation of the Scythian kings, the Greek colonies on the northern shores of the Black Sea rapidly grew during the 6th century BC.

=====The slave trade=====

In the 5th century, the Greek cities in the Aegean Sea had started to import slaves from Scythia immediately after the end of the Persian invasions of Greece. Although Scythian society was not heavily dependent on slaves, unlike the Greeks, the Scythian aristocrats nonetheless still found it profitable to organise raids in the forest steppe to obtain slaves, who were then brought to Pontic Olbia, where they were sold to Greek merchants.

The Scythians also sold slaves to the Greeks, with the slaves to be sold being acquired from neighbouring or subordinate tribes during military campaigns, and the Greek colonies on the northern Black Sea coast being hubs of slave trafficking. After the Greek city-state of Athens had defeated the Persians at Salamis in 480 BC, it bought 300 Scythian slave archers who acted as a police force in the city and who lived in tents. When the Greek city of Mytilene broke away from the Delian League in 428 BC, it also bought a similar force of Scythian warriors.

====Scythian imports====
Beginning in the 7th and 6th centuries BC, the Scythians had been importing craft goods and luxuries such as vessels, decorations made from previous metals, bronze items, personal ornaments, gold and silver vases, black burnished pottery, carved semi-precious and gem stones, wines, fabrics, oil, and offensive and defensive weapons made in the workshops of Pontic Olbia or in mainland Greece, as well as pottery made by the Greeks of the Aegean islands.

The Scythians also imported large amounts of Scythian-type precious metal items decorated in the &quot;Animal-style&quot; type of art made mainly by Greek craftsmen in the Greek colonies.

Among the Greek colonies, the Pontic Olbia served the demands of the Scythian aristocracy of the Borysthenēs river valley, and Pantikapaion supplied the Scythian aristocrats in the Tauric and Sindic Chersoneses, although Pontic Olbia started declining in the late 5th century BC due to most of the trade passing through it then shifting to transiting through the cities of the Cimmerian Bosporus constituting the Bosporan Kingdom.

===== Importation of wine =====
In exchange for their many exports, especially of slaves and metals, to Greece the Scythians bought various Greek products, especially  of wine, and the pottery used to consume said wine, such as  and . The Scythian aristocrats and royalty residing in the acropolis of the city of Kamianka shipped the surplus of metal produced in that city to Pontic Olbia to be traded in exchange for the wine and fine pottery that they consumed.

The island of Chios in the Aegean Sea, especially, produced wine to be sold to the Scythians, in exchange of which slaves from Scythia were sold in the island&#x27;s very prominent slave market.

The Scythians also bought olive oil, perfumes, ointments, and other luxury goods from the Greeks, such as Scythian-style objects crafted by Greek artisans.

===== Scythian trade relations =====
The Pontic Steppe was thus a particularly attractive territory for the Scythians to occupy because it allowed them to obtain grain to supplement their diet from the mixed farmer population of the forest steppe to their north, and exotic luxury goods for their aristocracy to use as status markers from the Greek colonies on the shore of the Black Sea: the Scythian aristocracy especially bought luxury goods which they used flauntingly during their lives and in their tombs as status markers: wine and the various Greek vessels used to mix and drink it were especially imported in large quantities and were even used as grave goods, while craftsmen in the Greek colonies manufactured items made of gold or electrum for Scythian patrons.

===== Pottery importation =====
During the earlier Middle Scythian period of the 5th century BC, the Scythians were importing Corinthian and Athenian pottery; and by the later Middle Scythian period of the 4th to 3rd centuries BC the market for Pontic Olbia was limited to a small part of western Scythia, while the rest of the kingdom&#x27;s importations came from the Bosporan kingdom, especially from Pantikapaion, from where came most of Scythia&#x27;s imported pottery, as well as richly decorated fine vases, , and decorative toreutic plaques for .

===== Hellenisation as consequence of trade =====
A consequence of the Scythian import of Greek-manufactured art and luxury goods was that Greek art significantly influenced Scythian art and artistic preferences, and, by the Middle and Late Scythian periods, most of the artwork in the Scythian tombs consisted of Scythian motifs and scenes representing Scythian life which had been done by Greek artisans.

====The gold trade route====
An important trade route existed in Scythia during the Early Scythian period which started in Pontic Olbia and followed the course of the Inhul river and crossed the Dnipro, after which it turned east until the country of the Gelonians and, after crossing the Don and the Volga, passed through the Ural Mountains and continued into Asia until the Altai Mountains.

Herodotus of Halicarnassus claimed that the Scythians frequently went to the eastern of this route, where they required the use of seven interpreters who knew seven different languages to be able to conduct trade.

Gold was traded from eastern Eurasia until Pontic Olbia through this route, and the Scythian tradesmen went to the distant regions on its course to carry out commerce. The conquest of the north Pontic region by the Scythians and their imposition of a &quot;&quot; created the conditions of safety for traders which enabled the establishment of this route. Olbian-made goods have been found at multiple locations lying on this route till the Ural Mountains.

This trade route was another significant source of revenue for the Scythian rulers, and its location also provided to Pontic Olbia the important position of being a commercial and cultural centre in the northern Pontic region for at least two centuries, and the city itself maintained friendly relations with the populations neighbouring it.

====Coinage====
Although the Scythians adopted the use of coinage as a method of payment for trade with the Greeks, they never used it for their own domestic market.

===Lifestyle===
====Equestrianism====
Being equestrian nomads, the Scythians excelled at horsemanship, with Scythian horses being the most high quality ones in Europe in the time of the Scythians, and Scythian men spent most of their lives on horseback.

During the 1st millennium BC, the wet and damp climate prevailing in the Pontic Steppe constituted a propitious environment which caused grass to grow in abundance, in turn allowing the Scythians to rear large herds of a small but very swift breed of horse that they rode directly and also used for drawing carts. Graeco-Roman authors claimed that the Scythians and Sarmatians would castrate their horses because these were otherwise too turbulent to handle.

=====Saddles=====
The saddle was invented by the Scythians in the 7th century BC, and consisted of two felt cushions stuffed with stag hair and mounted on felt sweatbands; in some cases, the cushions were attached to wooden saddle frames placed to their back and front. Scythian saddles had four raised bolsters at each corner, which, at a time when the stirrup had not yet been invented, allowed the riders to lean into the forward bolsters and raise themselves without being encumbered by the bouncing of their running horses.

Scythian saddles very colourful and dyed in red, yellow, dark blue, black, and white; they were also wholly decorated with wool, leather, and felt, as well as wooden carvings decorated in gold leaf.

====Nomadism and sedentarisation====
The peoples of Scythia consisted of a mix of sedentary farmer populations and nomads, with the tribes living in the steppes remaining primarily nomadic and having lifestyles and customs inextricably linked to their nomadic way of life.

During these early periods, the nomadic Scythians did not build settlements, but instead lived in wagons and temporary tents while leading a mobile pastoral life with their herds and wagon trains. The dominant tribe of the Royal Scythians, especially, originally led a transhumant pastoralist nomadic way of life by spending the summer northwards in the steppes and moving southwards towards the coasts in the winter.

Due to their nomadic lifestyle, the Scythians had many customs in common with other nomads like the Xiongnu, Göktürks and Mongols, such as the wearing of trousers and boots instead of the long flowing clothing of the Mediterranean and Chinese peoples.

With the integration of Scythia with the Greek colonies on the northern shore of the Black Sea, the Scythians soon became involved with deepening ties with the already sedentary Greeks, the development of sedentary forms of economy such as cultivating grain, fishing and craftsmanship, as well as the intensification of trade in the more nomadic parts of the Scythian kingdom beginning the 6th century BC, due to which some of the nomadic Scythians started to settle down, so that they had already started becoming semi-nomads and sedentary farmers by the 5th century BC during the Middle period, and they had largely become settled farmers by the 3rd century BC.

====Habitations====
Among the various Scythian tribes, the sedentary farmer tribes lived in western Scythia between the Danube and the Dnipro, while the nomadic pastoralist tribes lived in eastern Scythia between the Dnipro and the Don. Some of these sedentary farmers later moved into Crimea.

=====Tents=====
The more nomadic Scythians lived in habitations suited for nomadic lifestyles, such as tents of the same type as the more recent of the Turkic peoples and the of the Mongolic peoples that could easily be assembled and disassembled to be transported to different locations, as well as covered wagons that functioned as tents on up to six wheels. The walls and floors of these portable habitations were made of felt and the tents themselves were bound together using ropes made from horse hair.

The division of Scythian burial chambers into weapon-arsenals, kitchen areas, stables, and living rooms for the deceased family members and their servants, as well as their furnishings, were modelled on the habitations in which the Scythians dwelt during their lives.

Owing to their nomadic lifestyle, the early Scythians organised their dwellings into wagon trains which were constantly on the move according to the rhythm of their pastoralist movements.

=====Sedentary settlements=====
======Scythian settlements======
Beginning in the 5th and 4th centuries BC, the Scythians started building fortified sedentary settlements, of which the most important ones were located on major routes which provided access to the major rivers of Scythia, and corresponding to present-day Jelizavetovskaja at the mouth of the Tanais, Trakhtemyriv on the upper Borysthenēs, Nadlimans&#x27;ke near the estuary of Tyras, on the Vorskla river, and Kamianka at the confluence of the Borysthenēs and one of its tributaries.

The largest and most important of these was the settlement of Kamianka, built in the late 5th century BC and protected by ramparts and steep banks of the Borysthenēs river. The Kamianka site was the location of the seasonal royal headquarters and the aristocrats and royalty residing in the city&#x27;s acropolis, which contained stone houses and buildings built over stone foundations.

Kamianka was also the location of a city where the Scythian king oversaw metal production on an industrial scale, being therefore the residence of a farmer population and of metalsmiths. The houses of these farmers and metalsmiths were single-storeyed, with gable-rooves, ranged from 40 to 150 metres square in size and could include multiple rooms, and had clay-painted and felt-fabric adorned walls made of beams buried vertically in the ground; Kamianka also contained square pit houses made of pole constructions with recessed surfaces.

Blacksmiths&#x27; workshops in Scythian settlements from this time were located in both the ground-level and pit houses, where they formed groups of craftsmen&#x27;s quarters.

Smaller Scythian settlements also existed, where were cultivated large amounts of crops such as wheat, millet, and barley.

====Vehicles====
In addition to horse-riding and wagons, the Scythians also used carts which could cover large distances.

====Diet====
The Scythians ate the meat from the horses, cattle, and sheep they reared.

Milk, especially that of mares, was also an important part of the Scythians&#x27; diet, and it was both consumed and used to make cheese and an alcoholic drink made from milk similar to the  still widely consumed by Eurasian steppe nomads.

The Scythians also consumed wheat and millet in the form of a porridge.

The Scythians also supplemented, to varying extents depending on the regions where they lived, their diets by hunting deer, steppe antelopes, beavers, and other wild animals, as well as by fishing from the large rivers flowing through Scythia.

Cooking was mainly done in cauldrons and over fires using dried dung as fuel.

=====Wine consumption=====
In addition to these, the Scythians consumed large amounts of wine, which they bought from the Greeks. Unlike the Greeks, who diluted wine with water before drinking it, the Scythians drank it undiluted, due to which undiluted wine was called &quot;Scythian-style wine&quot; among the Greeks, who also equated the drinking of wine &quot;in the Scythian way&quot; with immoderate and unrestrained binge drinking.

During the earlier phase of the Scythian Pontic kingdom, wine was primarily consumed by the aristocracy, and its consumption became more prevalent among the wealthier members of the populace only after the 5th century BC.

====Clothing and grooming====

Scythian garments were sewn together from several pieces of cloth, and generally did not require the use of fibulae to be held in place, unlike the clothing of other ancient European peoples. Scythian dress consisted of combination of various leathers and furs designed for efficiency and comfort on horseback, and was expensively and richly decorated with brightly coloured embroidery and applique work as well as facings of pearl and gold.

The Scythians wore clothing typical of the steppe nomads, which tended to be soft, warm, and close-fitting, made from wool and leather and fur and felts, and decorated with d and golden ornaments:
*the clothing of Scythian men consisted of:
**long-sleeved jacket made of embroidered leather;
***these jackets were belted and had lapels on the chest, trimmed with fur at the edges;
***the jackets also possessed long flaps at their bottom that would have waved up and down during horse riding;
**long and wide trousers (called in the Scythian language) that could be either narrow or wide;
***Scythian trousers were elaborately decorated with patterned textiles and s;
**the jackets and trousers were decorated with curved lines and other patterns and trimmed with decorated strips along the seams;
**half-boots into which the trousers were tucked or ankle-boots;
***the boots were either tied to the feet with narrow laces under the ankle or around the foot itself;
**Scythian men wore pointed caps with flaps on the side and on the back that could be tied at the front during earlier periods;
**Scythian men went bareheaded in later times.
*Scythian women wore:
**shoes or short boots;
**long dresses that could be pleated or have furbelows on the lower edges;
**mantles;
**the dresses and mantles were decorated with triangular or round metallic plates, which were made of gold for wealthier women and of bronze for poorer women;
**women belonging to the upper classes wore:
*** cloaks over their dresses;
***tall headdresses whose shapes ranged from simple diadems to close-fitting caps to 30 cm-high -shaped hats;
***a veil over their head.
Scythian dress was brightly coloured using resist painting and embroidery, and was decorated with gold s sewn into the clothing.

Scythians wore jewellery usually made of gold, but sometimes also of bronze:
*both men and women wore:
**earrings;
**bracelets made of silver and bronze wire;
**neck rings and torcs made of gold with animal figure-shaped or animal head-shaped terminals;
***torcs were especially worn by members of the warrior aristocracy and was a necessary attribute of this class;
**necklaces made of gold beads and various imported semi-precious stones;
*Scythian women wore:
**earrings;
**elaborate torcs;
**rings of various shapes;
**gold bangles;
**bracelets of pearls and other materials.

=====Hairstyle=====
Scythian men grew their hair long and their beards to significant sizes. Nothing is known about the hairstyles of Scythian women.

=====Grooming=====
The Scythians were acquainted with the use of soap, which they used to wash their heads.

According to Herodotus of Halicarnassus, Scythian men however did not wash their bodies with water, and instead cleaned themselves in a steam bath in a small tent where the flower buds of cannabis were thrown on hot stones to induce intoxication.

Scythian women meanwhile used to clean and beautify themselves by using a paste made from the wood of cypress and cedar, ground together with frankincense, and water on a stone until it acquired a thick consistency. The women then applied this paste over themselves and removed it after a day, leaving their skin clean, glossy, and sweet-smelling. Scythian women also used cosmetics such as scented water and various ointments.

These cleaning practices were especially performed after funerals.

Scythian men and women both used mirrors, and bronze mirrors made in Pontic Olbia and whose handles were decorated with animal figures such as those of stags, panthers, and rams, were popular during the early Scythian periods.

====Medicine====
A group of Scythian shaman-priests called the (, ) was knowledgeable in the use of snake venom for medicinal purposes. During the Third Mithridatic War, these Agaroi used snake venom to stop a thigh wound received by Mithridates VI of Pontus from haemorrhaging.

Cannabis was used by the Scythians as a way to relieve pain from daily activities, arthritis, and constant warfare.

The Scythians applied the oil of wild cabbage, which has analgesic, circulation-stimulating, and anti-bacterial properties, on their bodies to help them withstand the cold in winter and to repel insects in the summer.

The paste made of cypress and cedar wood, frankincense, and water used by Scythian women to clean themselves also had medicinal properties since cedar and cypress oil and frankincense possess antiseptic properties useful for fighting infection, with cedar and cypress oil also being astringents capable of ameliorating oily and flaky skin and treat acne and dermatitis, while frankincense has anti-inflammatory, anti-anxiety, and anti-depressant properties.

In addition to human medicine, the Scythians were adept at veterinary medicine and were especially knowledgeable in treating the health problems of their horses.

====Pets====
The Scythians had domestic dogs.

=====Art=====
======Literary art======
The Scythians might have had bards who composed and recited oral poetry.

======Physical art======

======The &quot;Animal Style&quot;======
The art of the Scythians was part of specific zoomorphic style called the &quot;Animal Style,&quot; which was typical of the Eurasian steppe nomads and represented a limited and specific range of animals in very specific canonical poses.

======Development======
The &quot;Animal Style&quot; art of the Scythians was a variant of the art of the Eurasian Steppe nomads, which itself initially developed in eastern Eurasian steppes of Central Asia and Siberia during the 9th century BC under the partial influence of ancient Chinese art and of the &quot;static&quot; naturalistic art of the inhabitants of the Siberian woodlands, after which it arrived westward into eastern Europe during the 8th century BC.

The distinctive style of art characteristic of the Scythians proper emerged during their stay in Western Asia during the 7th century BC, and especially during their occupation of Media, when the Scythian upper class came under the influence of West Asian culture, as a consequence of which the art of the Scythians absorbed many West Asian motifs and themes.

Beginning in the 5th century BC, Scythian art experienced the influence of arriving Sauromatians from the east, the borrowing of elements from Thracian art as well as the incorporation of elements from Greek and Achaemenid Persian art.

This Scythian art formed out of various influences later spread to the west, in the region which corresponds to present Romania, and eventually it brought influences from Iranic and West Asian art into Celtic art, and also introduced metalwork types which followed Shang Chinese models, such as &quot;cruciform tubes&quot; used in harnesses, into Western Eurasia, where they were adopted by the Hallstatt culture.

Scythian art stopped existing after the end of the Pontic Scythian kingdom in the early 3rd century BC, and the art of the later Scythians of Crimea and Dobruja was completely Hellenised, with their paintings and sculptures belonging to the Greek artistic tradition and having probably been made by Greek sculptors.

====Religion====

The religion of the Scythians was a variant of the Pre-Zoroastrian Iranic religion which differed from Zoroastrian and the post-Zoroastrian Iranic religions, and instead belonged to a more archaic stage of Indo-Iranic religious development than the Zoroastrian and Hindu systems. The use of cannabis to induce trance and divination by soothsayers was a characteristic of the Scythian belief system.

Unlike the Persians and the Medes, the Iranic peoples of the steppe such as the Scythians and the Sarmatians were not affected by the Zoroastrian reforms of ancient Iranic religion.

Within the Scythian religion there existed a genealogical myth which the Scythian kings used as justification for their divine right to rule.

====Warfare====

The Scythians were a people with a strong warrior culture, and fighting was one of the main occupations of Scythian men, so that war constituted a sort of national industry for the Scythians, and was especially one through which they could meet their society&#x27;s demands and their aristocracy could obtain luxuries. Scythian men were all trained in war exercises and in archery from a young age, hence why the furnishings of Scythian burial chambers included weapons, thus reflecting the martial nature of their society which was made of mounted warriors. The Aroteres were an especially war-like Scythian tribe.

However, the mostly small number of depictions of warfare compared to the larger number of representations of peaceful pastoralist activities in Scythian petroglyphic art suggests that the war-like tendencies of the Scythians might have been exaggerated by Herodotus of Halicarnassus and the modern authors who drew on him as a source.

=====Weapons=====
The Scythians used weapons made from cast iron and bronze.

======Archery======
Mounted archery was the main form of Scythian warfare. Scythian saddles had four raised bolsters at each corner, which, at a time when the stirrup had not yet been invented, allowed the riders to lean into the forward bolsters and raise themselves so they could use shoot their arrows from horseback. This type of saddle preserved the mounted archer from the bouncing of the running horses, thus allowing Scythian mounted archers to operate at very high performance levels.

The main Scythian armament were the bow and arrows:
*the typical weapon of the Scythians was the very recurved or reflex composite bow that was easy to use for mounted warriors. Scythian bows were the most complex composite bows in both their recurved profiles and their cross-sections, highly engineered and made from wood, horn, sinew, and sturgeon fish glue through laborious craftsmanship, and were capable of delivering military draw weights;:
*although the shape of Scythian arrows changed with time, they maintained a basic structure. Scythian arrows had shafts made of reed or birch wood, with arrowheads mostly of bronze, and more rarely iron and bone.
*Scythian trilobate arrowheads possessed propeller twists that made them spin, thus making them more aerodynamically efficient;
*Scythian arrows sometimes made with a single barb on one side: these caused star wounds that were more difficult to sew together, therefore increasing the risk of haemorrhage among those shot, which terrorised those who received such wounds;
*arrowheads were likely fitted on detachable foreshafts, ensuring the arrowheads remained in the body thanks to the detachability of the foreshafts, which made them especially useful when using poisoned arrows;
*the shape of Scythian bows and the shape of their bronze arrowheads made them the most powerful firing weapon of their time, due to which they were adopted by West Asian armies in the 7nd century BC.

When not used, Scythian bows and arrows were kept in a combined quiver-bowcase called a  which was made of leather or bark and was decorated with gold or bronze plates and could each contain up to 300 arrows. Unlike quivers that were set at the right hip among all other cultures, Scythian were hanged from belts at the left hip, with the arrowd being usually taken from the using the bow hand and drawn on the bowstring using the right hand, although the Scythians were skilled at ambidextrous archery.

Scythian bows and arrows might have required the use of thumb rings to be drawn, although none have been found yet, possibly because hey might have been made of perishable materials.

======Poisons======
The Scythians coated their arrows with a potent poison referred to in Greek as (). To prepare this poison, the Scythians captured small adders that had recently given birth, which they left to decompose, while the Scythian priests filled leather bags with human blood and buried them in dung to putrefy it, after which they mixed decomposed matter in the blood with the decomposed remains of the snakes.

In addition to the snakes&#x27; venom retaining its effect in their decomposed bodies, the human blood was propitious for the growth of bacterial populations such as tetanus- and gangrene-causing germs from the dung. Thus, if an individual initially survived being shot with a poisoned Scythian arrow, they would still experience the effects of the snake poison, including the disintegration of blood cells, shock, and respiratory paralysis, with the gangrening of the wound starting the next day, followed by tetanus after around a week.

The was crafted to cause lasting harm so that even the most minor wounds from arrows coated with it had a high likeliness to be lethal, and the unlikely possible survivors of poisoning would have been incapacitated for life. The was used only against human enemies and was not used for hunting since the meat of animals contaminated with the toxins would not have been proper for consumption.

The stench of the -coated arrows also functioned as stench weapons because the near-unanimous revulsion by human cultures for smell of rotting and faeces, and the belief in ancient periods that such foul miasmas caused disease.

The was also referred to in Greek as (), meaning . The adjective (), meaning , was borrowed into Latin as , to which the meaning of the Greek term (), meaning was transferred. From Latin is derived the modern word , referring to something poisonous.

Another poison used by the Scythians to coat their arrows was hemlock.

The shafts and foreshafts of Scythian poisoned arrows were painted with zigzag and diamond patterns emulating the scaly designs of snake skins.

======Other weapons======
In addition to the bow and arrow, the Scythians also used weapons such as:
*iron spears measuring between 1.70 and 2.20 metres long with bay leaf-shaped spearheads that sometimes had a ferrule at the bottom;
*long swords in the early period;
*50 to 70 centimetre-short iron swords and daggers called :
**although considered &quot;typically Scythian&quot; weapons, the had been borrowed by the Scythians from Transcaucasian peoples, more specifically from Georgian Bronze Age weaponry.
*bimetallic pickaxes, called , made of an iron blade and a bronze socket;
*shaft-hole war-axes;
*pole-axes;
*other sorts of battle-axes;
*lances;
*darts;
*lassoes;
*and slings.

=====Armour=====
Some Scythian warriors wore rich protective armour and belts made of metal plates, including:
*commoner warriors used leather or hide armour;
*aristocrats used scale armour made of scales of bone, bronze, and iron sewn onto leather along the top edge;
**scale armour had been borrowed by the Scythians from the peoples of West Asia during the 7th century BC and then made into a prevalent aspect of the Scythian culture of the northern Pontic region;
**scale armour was also used to protect horses, especially in the chest area;
*sometimes, instead of armour, the Scythians used composite battle-belts, which were made of scales sewn onto wide strips of either iron sheet, hide, or leather;
*helmets:
**cast bronze helmets with an opening for the face, called of the &quot;Kuban type,&quot; were made by the native Caucasian peoples in the 6th and early 5th centuries BC for Scythians;
**Greek-made Attic, Corinthian, Chalcidic, and Thracian helmets replaced the Caucasian-made &quot;Kuban type&quot; helmets in the 6th century BC;
**composite scale helmets made of iron or bronze plates started being used in the later 6th century BC;
*Greek-made greaves were imported from the 5th century BC.

The Scythians used locally-made small hide or wicker or wooden shields reinforced with iron strips, with the shields of Scythian aristocrats often being decorated with decorative central plaques.

=====Command structure=====
The high king had the supreme authority over the armies of the Royal Scythians and their subordinate tribes; the local lords were in charge of the army of a nome; the heads of clans were in charge of war bands.

The nomes of the Scythian kingdom were in charge of spreading information about the war at the time of the Persian invasion of Scythia.

Mounted archery was the mode of fighting of the free commoners of Scythia, who were called () in Greek.

Serfs and slaves were subordinate to the warriors and accompanied them unarmed, and would be armed with spears only in extremely severe situations.

=====Tactics=====
The Scythians fought in mass formations of mounted archers and were adept at using feigned flight tactics.

=====War customs=====
The Scythians had several war-related customs meant to transfer the power of defeated enemies to Scythian warriors:
*every Scythian warrior would drink the blood of the first enemy they would kill;
*the Scythians would collect the severed heads of their enemies and bring them to their king;
**the war spoils would be divided among the warriors depending on the number of heads they brought;
**it was also on the number of severed heads that a warrior had brought to the king that depended the rank of honour given on the warriors at the annual ceremony where the local lords of the nomes would pour wine into a large vessel for the warriors who had been successful in battle by killing at least one enemy;
**it was considered the worst disgrace possibly by the Scythians to sit to one side due to having killed no enemies;
*the heads of enemies were scalped, and the scalps themselves were tanned and used as:
**decorative handkerchiefs tied to the bridles of horses;
**as towels to be shown off;
**the ancient Greeks associated the practice of scalping so closely with the Scythians that they used the term (), literally meaning &quot;to Scythianise away,&quot; as name for scalping;
*the Scythians would fashion the tops of their enemies&#x27; skulls into drinking bowls which were covered in leather, and would be gilded on the inside if they belonged to rich Scythians;
**this custom was likely derived from the belief that this was a way of absorbing the power of an enemy;
*the corpses of enemies would be flayed, after which the skin would be tanned, and the warriors would:
**either stretch them on wooden frames and carried by the warriors;
**or made into saddles;
**the skin and fingernails from the enemies&#x27; right hands was used to make .

==Physical appearance==
The Scythians looked similar to the populations of Europe, and depictions of Scythian men in Persian sculptures and on Scythian gold objects show them as stocky and powerfully built, with strong facial features and long and thick wavy hair.

Upper class Scythians were particularly tall with the men usually being over 1.80 metres tall, sometimes reaching 1.90 metres, and on some rarer occasions being even more than 2 metres tall.

The difference in height between these upper class Scythians and the Scythian commoners was of around 10 to 15 centimetres, with the height difference being a symbol of status among the upper-class men. Analysis of skeletons shows that Scythians had longer arm and leg bones and stronger bone formation than present-day people living in their former territories.

Due to his unfamiliarity with Scythian dress, Pseudo-Hippocrates inaccurately claimed that the Scythians suffered from hypermobility of the joints.

In &quot;Histories&quot;, the 5th-century BC Greek historian Herodotus describes the Budini of Scythia as red-haired and grey-eyed. In the 5th century BC, Greek physician Hippocrates argued that the Scythians were light skinned. In the 3rd century BC, the Greek poet Callimachus described the Arismapes (Arimaspi) of Scythia as fair-haired. The 2nd-century BC Han Chinese envoy Zhang Qian described the Sai (Saka), an eastern people closely related to the Scythians, as having yellow (probably meaning hazel or green) and blue eyes. In the late 2nd century AD, the Christian theologian Clement of Alexandria says that the Scythians and the Celts have long auburn hair. The 2nd-century Greek philosopher Polemon includes the Scythians among the northern peoples characterised by red hair and blue-grey eyes. In the late 2nd or early 3rd century AD, the Greek physician Galen writes that Scythians, Sarmatians, Illyrians, Germanic peoples and other northern peoples have reddish hair. The fourth-century bishop Gregory of Nyssa wrote that the Scythians were fair skinned and blond haired. The 5th-century physician Adamantius, who often followed Polemon, describes the Scythians as fair-haired.

=== Archaeology ===
Scythian archaeology can be divided into three stages:
* Early Scythian – from the mid-8th or the late 7th century BC to 
* Classical Scythian or Mid-Scythian – from to 
* Late Scythian – from to the mid-3rd century AD, in the Crimea and the Lower Dnipro, by which time the population was settled.

Archaeological remains of the Scythians include barrow grave tombs called &quot;kurgans&quot; (ranging from simple exemplars to elaborate &quot;Royal kurgans&quot; containing the &quot;Scythian triad&quot; of weapons, horse-harness, and Scythian-style wild-animal art), gold, silk, and animal sacrifices, in places also with suspected human sacrifices.

Mummification techniques and permafrost have aided in the relative preservation of some remains. Scythian archaeology also examines the remains of cities and fortifications.

==Genetics==
The Scythians (specifically Western or Pontic Scythians, as in differentiation from Eastern Scythian Saka) primarily emerged from the Bronze and Iron Age population of the Pontic-Caspian and Central Asian Steppe (Western Steppe Herders or &quot;Steppe_MLBA&quot;) associated with the Andronovo culture. The (Western or Pontic) Scythians (such as Sarmatians) fall in or close to the European-related cluster, while Eastern Scythians (such as the Pazyryk culture) are more heterogeneous, both genetically and culturally.

=== Maternal haplogroups ===
Western Scythians carried diverse West Eurasian and East Eurasian maternal lineages. Initially, the Western Scythians carried only West Eurasian maternal haplogroups, however the frequency of East Eurasian haplogroups rises to 26% in samples dated from the 6th-2nd centuries BCE. Among the Western Scythians discovered at Rostov-on-Don, in European Russia, East Eurasian maternal haplogroups make up 37.5% of the total. These results suggest that there was increasing marriages to women of East Eurasian origin among the Western Scythians. The East Eurasian maternal lineages were likely brought by individuals sharing affinities with modern-day Nganasan people, as well as the ancient Okunevo culture.

=== Paternal haplogroups ===
Scythians living in the steppes near the Seversky-Donets River had haplogroup R1a, while Scythians living near the Dniester River had haplogroups R1b, E1b and I2a. Those Scythians living in the forest-steppes west of the Dnieper had haplogroups R1a, R1b and J2a, while Scythians near the Seversky-Donets River had haplogroups R1a and Q1b.

==List of rulers==
The relationships of the various Scythian kings with each other are not known for certain, although the historian and anthropologist Anatoly Khazanov suggests that the Scythians had been ruled by the same dynasty from the time of their stay in West Asia until the end of their kingdom in the Pontic steppe, and that Madyes and the later Scythian kings Spargapeithes and Ariapeithes belonged to the same dynasty, and Ellis Minns suggested in 1913 that Idanthyrsus was probably the father of Ariapeithes.

Meanwhile, the scholar Askold Ivantchik instead considers Madyes, Spargapeithes, and Ariapeithes to have each belonged to a different dynasty.

<text>The Marihuana Tax Act of 1937, , was a United States Act that placed a tax on the sale of cannabis. The H.R. 6385 act was drafted by Harry Anslinger and introduced by Rep. Robert L. Doughton of North Carolina, on April 14, 1937. The Seventy-fifth United States Congress held hearings on April 27, 28, 29th, 30th, and May 4, 1937. Upon the congressional hearings confirmation, the H.R. 6385 act was redrafted as H.R. 6906 and introduced with House Report 792. The Act is referred to, using the modern spelling, as the 1937 Marijuana Tax Act. It was overturned in 1969 in &quot;Leary v. United States&quot;, and was repealed by Congress the next year.

==Background==
Regulations and restrictions on the sale of Cannabis sativa as a drug began as early as 1906 (see Legal history of cannabis in the United States). The head of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics (FBN), Harry J. Anslinger, alleged, in the 1930s, the FBN had an increase of reports of people using marijuana. In 1935, he gained the support of president Franklin D. Roosevelt lobbying states to adoption the model Uniform State Narcotic Act to regulate of cannabis. The Marihuana Tax Act, according to Clinton Hester, the then-Assistant General Counsel to the United States Treasury Department, was itself based on the National Firearms Act and the Harrison Narcotics Tax Act: 

The total production of hemp fiber in the United States in 1933 decreased to around 500 tons per year. Cultivation of hemp began to increase in 1934 and 1935, but production remained low compared with other fibers.

Interested parties write that the aim of the Act was to reduce the hemp industry through excessive taxation largely as an effort of businessmen Andrew Mellon, Randolph Hearst, and the Du Pont family. The same parties argue that with the invention of the decorticator, hemp was an economical replacement for paper pulp in the newspaper industry. Newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst realized cheap, sustainable, and easily-grown hemp threatened his extensive timber holdings. Mellon, Secretary of the Treasury and the wealthiest man in the US, invested heavily in the Du Pont family&#x27;s new synthetic fiber, nylon, to compete with hemp. 1916, United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) chief scientists Jason L. Merrill and Lyster H. Dewey created a paper, USDA Bulletin No. 404 &quot;Hemp Hurds as Paper-Making Material&quot;, in which they concluded this paper from the woody inner portion of the hemp stem broken into pieces, the &#x27;hemp hurds&#x27;, was &quot;favorable in comparison with those used with pulp wood&quot;. Dewey and Merrill believed hemp hurds were a sustainable source for paper production. The concentration of cellulose in hemp hurds is generally around 35%. Manufacture of paper -- on equipment designed to use wood-pulp -- with hemp as a raw material shows hemp lacks the qualities needed to become a major competitor to the traditional paper industry. 2003, 95% of the hemp hurds in the EU were used for animal bedding, almost 5% were used as building material. Spokespersons from DuPont and many fiber manufacturers dispute a link between their promotion of nylon over hemp. They explain that the purpose of developing nylon was to produce a fiber competitive with silk and rayon.

The American Medical Association (AMA) opposed the taxation because the tax was imposed on physicians prescribing cannabis, retail pharmacists selling cannabis, and medical cannabis cultivation/manufacturing. The AMA proposed cannabis instead be added to the Harrison Narcotics Tax Act which would have been more efficient and created less burden on doctors. Dr. William Creighton Woodward, legislative counsel for the AMA, testified on behalf of the AMA. He stated that the claims about marijuana addiction, violence, and overdosage were not supported, and that the law should not burden further investigation into medical use.

After hearings with lawyers from Du Pont Chemicals and the Hearst Newspapers Group, the taxation was passed on the grounds of &#x27;differing&#x27; reports and hearings. Anslinger also referred to the International Opium Convention from 1928 included cannabis as a drug not a medicine. All state legislatures approved laws against improper use of cannabis based on the model Uniform State Narcotic Act. By 1951, however, spokespeople from Du Pont, Hearst and others came up with new improved rationalizations, and the Boggs Act superseded the Marihuana Taxation Act of 1937. In August 1954, the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 was enacted, and the Marihuana Taxation Act was included in Subchapter A of Chapter 39 of the 1954 Code.

==Operation of the act==

Shortly after the 1937 Marihuana Tax Act went into effect on October 1, 1937, the Federal Bureau of Narcotics and Denver City police arrested Moses Baca for possession and Samuel Caldwell for dealing. Baca and Caldwell&#x27;s arrest made them the first marijuana convictions under U.S. federal law for not paying the marijuana tax. Judge Foster Symes sentenced Baca to 18 months and Caldwell to four years in Leavenworth Penitentiary for violating the 1937 Marihuana Tax Act.

After the Philippines fell to Japanese forces in 1942, the Department of Agriculture and the US Army urged farmers to grow fiber hemp. Tax stamps for cultivation of fiber hemp began to be issued to farmers. Without any change in the Marihuana Tax Act, were cultivated with hemp between 1942 and 1945. The last commercial hemp fields were planted in Wisconsin in 1957.

In 1967, President Johnson&#x27;s Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice opined, &quot;The Act raises an insignificant amount of revenue and exposes an insignificant number of marijuana transactions to public view, since only a handful of people are registered under the Act. It has become, in effect, solely a criminal law, imposing sanctions upon persons who sell, acquire, or possess marijuana.&quot;

In 1969 in &quot;Leary v. United States&quot;, part of the Act was ruled to be unconstitutional as a violation of the Fifth Amendment, since a person seeking the tax stamp would have to incriminate him/herself. In response the Congress passed the Controlled Substances Act as Title II of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, which repealed the 1937 Act.

==Etymology==
Although the spelling &quot;marijuana&quot; is common in current use, the spelling used in the Marihuana Taxation Act is &quot;marihuana&quot;. &quot;Marihuana&quot; was the spelling used in Federal documents at the time.

In addition, the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 legitimized the use of the term &quot;marijuana&quot; as a label for hemp and cannabis plants and products in the US and around the world. Prior to 1937, &quot;marijuana&quot; was slang; it was not included in any official dictionaries. The word &quot;marijuana&quot; is probably of Mexican origin. Mexico passed prohibition for export to the US in 1925 following the International Opium Convention. In the years leading up to the taxation act, it was in common use in the United States, &quot;smoked like tobacco&quot;, and called &quot;ganjah&quot;, or &quot;ganja&quot;.

==The La Guardia Committee Report==
The only authoritative voice that opposed Anslinger&#x27;s campaign against cannabis was that of New York Mayor, Fiorello La Guardia, who appointed in 1938 a commission of investigation, and in 1944 strongly objected to Anslinger&#x27;s campaign with the La Guardia Committee.

<doc id="55097" wikidata="Q953944" url="?curid=55097" title="U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission">
<text>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is an independent agency of the United States federal government, created in the aftermath of the Wall Street crash of 1929. Its primary purpose is to enforce laws against market manipulation.

Created by Section 4 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (now codified as and commonly referred to as the Exchange Act or the 1934 Act), the SEC enforces the Securities Act of 1933, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002, among other statutes.

==Overview==
The SEC has a three-part mission: to protect investors; maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and facilitate capital formation.

To achieve its mandate, the SEC enforces the statutory requirement that public companies and other regulated entities submit quarterly and annual reports, as well as other periodic disclosures. In addition to annual financial reports, company executives must provide a narrative account, called the &quot;management discussion and analysis&quot; (MD&amp;A), that outlines the previous year of operations and explains how the company fared in that time period. MD&amp;A usually addresses the upcoming year, outlining future goals and approaches to new projects.

Quarterly and semiannual reports from public companies are crucial for investors to make sound decisions when investing in capital markets. Unlike banking, investment in capital markets is not guaranteed by the federal government. The potential for large gains needs to be weighed against that of sizable losses. Mandatory disclosure of financial and other information about the issuer and the security itself gives private individuals as well as large institutions the same fundamental facts about the public companies they invest in, thereby increasing public scrutiny while reducing insider trading and fraud.

In an attempt to level the playing field for all investors, the SEC maintains an online database called EDGAR (the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system) from which investors can access information filed with the agency, such as reports. The same online system also accepts tips and complaints from investors to help the SEC track down violators of the securities laws, as well as offering publications on investment-related topics for public education. The SEC maintains a strict policy of refraining from commenting on the existence or status of any ongoing investigation.

==History==
===Background===
Prior to the enactment of the federal securities laws and the creation of the SEC, securities trading was governed by so-called blue sky laws. These laws were enacted and enforced at the state level and regulated the offering and sale of securities to protect the public from fraud. Though the specific provisions of these laws varied among states, they all required the registration of all securities offerings and sales, as well as of every U.S. stockbroker and brokerage firm. However, blue sky laws were generally considered ineffective. For example, as early as 1915, the Investment Bankers Association told its members that they could circumvent blue sky laws by making securities offerings across state lines through the mail.

===Founding===

The SEC&#x27;s authority was established by the Securities Act of 1933 and Securities Exchange Act of 1934; both laws are considered parts of Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal program.

After the Pecora Commission hearings on abuses and frauds in securities markets, Congress passed the Securities Act of 1933 (), which federally regulates original issues of securities across state lines, primarily by requiring that issuing companies register distributions prior to sale so that investors may access basic financial information and make informed decisions. For the first year of the law&#x27;s enactment, the enforcement of the statute rested with the Federal Trade Commission.

The subsequent Securities Exchange Act of 1934 () regulates secondary markets for securities. The 1934 Act regulates secondary trading between individuals and companies which are often unrelated to the original issuers of securities. Entities under the SEC&#x27;s authority include securities exchanges with physical trading floors such as the New York Stock Exchange, self-regulatory organizations, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, NASDAQ, alternative trading systems, and any other persons engaged in transactions for the accounts of others. Section 4 of the 1934 Act transferred the FTC&#x27;s enforcement authority under the 1933 Act to the newly created Securities and Exchange Commission and tasked the new commission with enforcing both acts.
In 1934, Roosevelt named his friend Joseph P. Kennedy, a self-made multimillionaire, financier, and leader among the Irish-American community, as chairman of the SEC. Roosevelt chose Kennedy partly based on his experience on Wall Street. Two of the other five commissioners were James M. Landis and Ferdinand Pecora. Kennedy added a number of intelligent young lawyers to the SEC staff, including William O. Douglas and Abe Fortas, both of whom later became Supreme Court justices.

Kennedy&#x27;s team defined four missions for the new commission: (1) to restore investor confidence in the securities market, which had practically collapsed; (2) to restore integrity to securities markets by prosecuting and eliminating fraudulent and unsound practices targeting investors; (3) to end million-dollar insider trading by top officials of major corporations; and (4) to establish a complex and universal system of registration for securities sold in America, with a clear-cut set of deadlines, rules and guidelines. The SEC succeeded; Kennedy reassured the American business community that they would no longer be deceived and tricked and taken advantage of by Wall Street. He became a cheerleader for ordinary investors to return to the market and enable the economy to grow again.

Later SEC commissioners and chairmen include William O. Douglas, Jerome Frank, and William J. Casey.

Since 1994, most registration statements (and associated materials) filed with the SEC can be accessed via the SEC&#x27;s online system, EDGAR.

===21st century===
In 2019, the Securities and Exchange Commission Historical Society introduced an online gallery to illustrate changes in the US securities market structure since the 1930s. The online gallery features a narrative history supported by dozens of documents, papers, interviews, photos and videos.

===List of chairs===

==Organizational structure==
===Commission members===
The commission has five commissioners who are appointed by the president of the United States. No more than three commissioners may belong to the same political party. Their terms last five years and are staggered so that one commissioner&#x27;s term ends on June 5 of each year. Service may continue up to eighteen additional months past term expiration.

The president also designates one of the commissioners as chairman, the SEC&#x27;s top executive. However, the president does not possess the power to fire the appointed commissioners, a provision that was made to ensure the independence of the SEC. This issue arose during the 2007–2008 financial crisis and the John McCain 2008 presidential campaign.

===Current commissioners===
The current board members :
===Divisions===

Within the SEC, there are six divisions, which is headquartered in Washington, D.C.

The SEC&#x27;s divisions are:
* Corporation Finance
* Trading and Markets
* Investment Management
* Enforcement
* Economic and Risk Analysis
* Examinations

Corporation Finance is the division that oversees the disclosure made by public companies, as well as the registration of transactions, such as mergers, made by companies. The division is also responsible for operating EDGAR.

The Trading and Markets division oversees self-regulatory organizations (SRO&#x27;s) such as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB) and all broker-dealer firms and investment houses. This division also interprets proposed changes to regulations and monitors operations of the industry. In practice, the SEC delegates most of its enforcement and rulemaking authority to FINRA. In fact, all trading firms not regulated by other SROs must register as a member of FINRA. Individuals trading securities must pass exams administered by FINRA to become registered representatives.

The Investment Management Division oversees registered investment companies, which include mutual funds, as well as registered investment advisors. These entities are subject to extensive regulation under various federal securities laws. The Division of Investment Management administers various federal securities laws, in particular, the Investment Company Act of 1940 and Investment Advisers Act of 1940. This division&#x27;s responsibilities include:
* assisting the commission in interpreting laws and regulations for the public and SEC inspection and enforcement staff;
* responding to no-action requests and requests for exemptive relief;
* reviewing investment company and investment adviser filings;
* assisting the commission in enforcement matters involving investment companies and advisers; and
* advising the commission on adapting SEC rules to new circumstances.

The Enforcement Division investigates violations of the securities laws and regulations to bring legal actions against alleged violators. It is the largest division in terms of both headcount and budget, and its resources have been increased by more than 50% since the 2007–2008 financial crisis. The SEC can bring a civil action in a U.S. District Court, or an administrative proceeding which is heard by an independent administrative law judge (ALJ). The SEC does not have criminal authority but may refer matters to state and federal prosecutors.

The Economic and Risk Analysis Division (DERA) was created in September 2009 to integrate financial economics and rigorous data analytics into the core mission of the SEC. The division is involved across the entire range of SEC activities, including policy-making, rule-making, enforcement, and examination. As the agency&#x27;s &quot;think tank&quot;, DERA relies on a variety of academic disciplines, quantitative and non-quantitative approaches, and knowledge of market institutions and practices to help the commission approach complex matters in a fresh light. DERA also assists in the commission&#x27;s efforts to identify, analyze, and respond to risks and trends, including those associated with new financial products and strategies. Through the range and nature of its activities, DERA serves the critical function of promoting collaborative efforts throughout the agency and breaking through silos that might otherwise limit the impact of the agency&#x27;s institutional expertise. The division&#x27;s activities include providing detailed, high-quality economic and statistical analyzes, and specific subject-matter expertise to the commission and other divisions/offices and developing customized, analytic tools and analyzes to proactively detect market risks indicative of possible violations of the federal securities laws. Using data, DERA staff create analytic programs designed to detect patterns identifying risks, enabling commission divisions and offices to deploy scarce resources targeting possible misconduct. DERA also houses the commission&#x27;s chief economist.

The Division of Examinations conducts the SEC&#x27;s National Exam Program. The division&#x27;s mission is to protect investors, ensure market integrity and support responsible capital formation through risk-focused strategies that: (1) improve compliance; (2) prevent fraud; (3) monitor risk; and (4) inform policy. The results of the division&#x27;s examinations are used by the SEC to inform rule-making initiatives, identify and monitor risks, improve industry practices and pursue misconduct.

===Regional offices===
There are 11 regional offices throughout the US, which are listed below along with the name of the respective regional director.

Among the SEC&#x27;s offices are:
* The &quot;Office of General Counsel&quot;, which acts as the agency&#x27;s &quot;lawyer&quot; before federal appellate courts and provides legal advice to the commission and other SEC divisions and offices;
* The &quot;Office of the Chief Accountant&quot;, which establishes and enforces accounting and auditing policies set by the SEC. This office has played a role in such areas as working with the Financial Accounting Standards Board to develop Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board in developing audit requirements, and the International Accounting Standards Board in advancing the development of International Financial Reporting Standards;
* The &quot;Office of Compliance, Inspections and Examinations&quot;, which inspects broker-dealers, stock exchanges, credit rating agencies, registered investment companies, including both closed-end and open-end (mutual funds) investment companies, money funds. and Registered Investment Advisors;
* The &quot;Office of International Affairs&quot;, which represents the SEC abroad and which negotiates international enforcement information-sharing agreements, develops the SEC&#x27;s international regulatory policies in areas such as mutual recognition, and helps develop international regulatory standards through organizations such as the International Organization of Securities Commissions and the Financial Stability Forum; and
* The &quot;Office of Information Technology&quot;, which supports the commission and staff in information technology, including application development, infrastructure operations. and engineering, user support, IT program management, capital planning, security, and enterprise architecture.
* The &quot;Inspector General&quot;. The SEC announced in January 2013 that it had named Carl Hoecker the new inspector general. He has a staff of 22.
* The &quot;SEC Office of the Whistleblower&quot; provides assistance and information from a whistleblower who knows of possible securities law violations: this can be among the most powerful weapons in the law enforcement arsenal of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Created by Section 922 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act amended the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the &quot;Exchange Act&quot;) by, among other things, adding Section 21F, entitled &quot;Securities Whistleblower Incentives and Protection&quot;. Section 21F directs the commission to make monetary awards to eligible individuals who voluntarily provide original information that leads to successful commission enforcement actions resulting in the imposition of monetary sanctions over $1,000,000, and certain successful related actions.

==Communications==
===Comment letters===
Comment letters are issued by the SEC&#x27;s Division of Corporation Finance in response to a company&#x27;s public filing. This letter, initially private, contains an itemized list of requests from the SEC. Each comment in the letter asks the filer to provide additional information, modify their submitted filing, or change the way they disclose in future filings. The filer must reply to each item in the comment letter. The SEC may then reply back with follow-up comments. This correspondence is later made public.

In October 2001 the SEC wrote to CA, Inc., covering 15 items, mostly about CA&#x27;s accounting, including 5 about revenue recognition. The chief executive officer of CA, to whom the letter was addressed, pleaded guilty to fraud at CA in 2004.

In June 2004, the SEC announced that it would publicly post all comment letters, to give investors access to the information in them. An analysis of regulatory filings in May 2006 over the prior 12 months indicated, that the SEC had not accomplished what it said it would do. The analysis found 212 companies that had reported receiving comment letters from the SEC, but only 21 letters for these companies were posted on the SEC&#x27;s website. John W. White, the head of the Division of Corporation Finance, told the &quot;New York Times&quot; in 2006: &quot;We have now resolved the hurdles of posting the information... We expect a significant number of new postings in the coming months.&quot;

===No-action letters===
No-action letters are letters by the SEC staff indicating that the staff will not recommend to the commission that the SEC undertake enforcement action against a person or company if that entity engages in a particular action. These letters are sent in response to requests made when the legal status of an activity is not clear. These letters are publicly released and increase the body of knowledge on what exactly is and is not allowed. They represent the staff&#x27;s interpretations of the securities laws and, while persuasive, are not binding on the courts.

One such use, from 1975 to 2007, was with the nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO), a credit rating agency that issues credit ratings that the SEC permits other financial firms to use for certain regulatory purposes.

==Freedom of Information Act processing performance==
In the latest Center for Effective Government analysis of 15 federal agencies which receive the most Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests published in 2015 (using 2012 and 2013 data, the most recent years available), the SEC was among the 5 lowest performers, earned a D− by scoring 61 out of a possible 100 points, i.e. did not earn a satisfactory overall grade. It had deteriorated from a D− in 2013.

==Operations==

=== List of major SEC enforcement actions (2009–12) ===
The SEC&#x27;s Enforcement Division took a number of major actions in 2009–12.

===Regulatory action in the credit crunch===
The SEC announced on September 17, 2008, strict new rules to prohibit all forms of &quot;naked short selling&quot; as a measure to reduce volatility in turbulent markets.

The SEC investigated cases involving individuals attempting to manipulate the market by passing false rumors about certain financial institutions. The commission has also investigated trading irregularities and abusive short-selling practices. Hedge fund managers, broker-dealers, and institutional investors were also asked to disclose under oath certain information pertaining to their positions in credit default swaps. The commission also negotiated the largest settlements in the history of the SEC (approximately $51 billion in all) on behalf of investors who purchased auction rate securities from six different financial institutions.

===Regulatory failures===
The SEC has been criticized &quot;for being too &#x27;tentative and fearful&#x27; in confronting wrongdoing on Wall Street&quot;, and for doing &quot;an especially poor job of holding executives accountable&quot;.

Christopher Cox, the former SEC chairman, has recognized the organization&#x27;s multiple failures in relation to the Bernard Madoff fraud. Starting with an investigation in 1992 into a Madoff feeder fund that only invested with Madoff, and which, according to the SEC, promised &quot;curiously steady&quot; returns, the SEC did not investigate indications that something was amiss in Madoff&#x27;s investment firm. The SEC has been accused of missing numerous red flags and ignoring tips on Madoff&#x27;s alleged fraud.

As a result, Cox said that an investigation would ensue into &quot;all staff contact and relationships with the Madoff family and firm, and their impact, if any, on decisions by staff regarding the firm&quot;. SEC assistant director of the Office of Compliance Investigations Eric Swanson had met Madoff&#x27;s niece, Shana Madoff, when Swanson was conducting an SEC examination of whether Bernard Madoff was running a Ponzi scheme because she was the firm&#x27;s compliance attorney. The investigation was closed, and Swanson subsequently left the SEC, and married Shana Madoff.

Approximately 45 percent of institutional investors thought that better oversight by the SEC could have prevented the Madoff fraud. Harry Markopolos complained to the SEC&#x27;s Boston office in 2000, telling the SEC staff they should investigate Madoff because it was impossible to legally make the profits Madoff claimed using the investment strategies that he said he used.

In June 2010, the SEC settled a wrongful termination lawsuit with former SEC enforcement lawyer Gary J. Aguirre, who was terminated in September 2005 following his attempt to subpoena Wall Street figure John J. Mack in an insider trading case involving hedge fund Pequot Capital Management; Mary Jo White, who later served as chair of the 
SEC, was at the time representing Morgan Stanley and was involved in this case. While the insider case was dropped at the time, a month prior to the SEC&#x27;s settlement with Aguirre the SEC filed charges against Pequot. The Senate released a report in August 2007 detailing the issue and calling for reform of the SEC.

On September 26, 2016, Democratic senator Mark Warner sent a letter to the SEC, asking them to evaluate whether the current disclosure regime was adequate, citing the low number of companies&#x27; disclosures to date.

====Inspector General office failures====
In 2009, the Project on Government Oversight, a government watchdog group, sent a letter to Congress criticizing the SEC for failing to implement more than half of the recommendations made to it by its Inspector General. According to POGO, in the prior two years, the SEC had taken no action on 27 out of 52 recommended reforms suggested in Inspector General reports, and still had a &quot;pending&quot; status on 197 of the 312 recommendations made in audit reports. Some of the recommendations included imposing disciplinary action on SEC employees who receive improper gifts or other favors from financial companies, and investigating and reporting the causes of the failures to detect the Madoff ponzi scheme.

In a 2011 article by Matt Taibbi in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, former SEC employees were interviewed and commented negatively on the SEC&#x27;s Office of the Inspector General (OIG). Going to the OIG was &quot;well-known to be a career-killer&quot;.

Because of concerns raised by David P. Weber, former SEC Chief Investigator, regarding conduct by SEC Inspector General H. David Kotz, Inspector General David C. Williams of the U.S. Postal Service was brought in to conduct an independent, outside review of Kotz&#x27;s alleged improper conduct in 2012. Williams concluded in his 66-page Report that Kotz violated ethics rules by overseeing probes that involved people with whom he had conflicts of interest due to &quot;personal relationships&quot;. The report questioned Kotz&#x27;s work on the Madoff investigation, among others, because Kotz was a &quot;very good friend&quot; with Markopolos. It concluded that while it was unclear when Kotz and Markopolos became friends, it would have violated U.S. ethics rules if their relationship began before or during Kotz&#x27;s Madoff investigation. The report also found that Kotz himself &quot;appeared to have a conflict of interest&quot; and should not have opened his Standford investigation, because he was friends with a female attorney who represented victims of the fraud.

==== Destruction of documents ====
According to former SEC employee and whistleblower Darcy Flynn, also reported by Taibbi, the agency routinely destroyed thousands of documents related to preliminary investigations of alleged crimes committed by Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, SAC Capital, and other financial companies involved in the Great Recession that the SEC was supposed to have been regulating. The documents included those relating to &quot;Matters Under Inquiry&quot;, or MUI, the name the SEC gives to the first stages of the investigation process. The tradition of destruction began as early as the 1990s. This SEC activity eventually caused a conflict with the National Archives and Records Administration when it was revealed to them in 2010 by Flynn. Flynn also described a meeting at the SEC in which top staff discussed &quot;refusing to admit the destruction had taken place, because it was possibly illegal&quot;.

Iowa Republican Senator Charles Grassley, among others, took note of Flynn&#x27;s call for protection as a whistleblower, and the story of the agency&#x27;s document-handling procedures. The SEC issued a statement defending its procedures. NPR quoted University of Denver Sturm College of Law professor Jay Brown as saying: &quot;My initial take on this is it&#x27;s a tempest in a teapot,&quot; and Jacob Frenkel, a securities lawyer in the Washington, D.C., area, as saying in effect &quot;there&#x27;s no allegation the SEC tossed sensitive documents from banks it got under subpoena in high-profile cases that investors and lawmakers care about&quot;. NPR concluded its report:

The debate boils down to this: What does an investigative record mean to Congress? And the courts? Under the law, those investigative records must be kept for 25 years. But federal officials say no judge has ruled that papers related to early-stage SEC inquiries are investigative records. The SEC&#x27;s inspector general says he&#x27;s conducting a thorough investigation into the allegations. [Kotz] tells NPR that he&#x27;ll issue a report by the end of September.

==== SEC and cryptocurrency ====
On June 5, 2023, the SEC filed 13 charges against Binance entities and its founder Changpeng Zhao, citing allegations of mishandling customer funds and operating without proper registration. The following day, the SEC charged Coinbase for operating as an unregistered securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency, further signaling its intensified scrutiny of major players in the industry.

A key point of contention between the SEC and the crypto industry lies in defining what constitutes a security. The SEC applies the Howey Test, derived from a 1946 U.S. Supreme Court decision, which defines a security as &quot;an investment of money in a common enterprise with profits to come solely from the efforts of others.&quot; The agency has classified many crypto assets as securities based on this test, asserting that their value often depends on the efforts of developers or other central parties behind blockchain projects. Critics argue that the test is outdated and ill-suited to the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies, leaving regulatory definitions unclear and fostering uncertainty. Research by economists found that unpredictable SEC enforcement actions under Gensler, classifying cryptocurrencies as securities without clear guidelines, caused prolonged destabilization in crypto markets. Unclear guidelines raise doubts about the agency&#x27;s ability to maintain fair and orderly markets.

SEC and Cypersecurity Risk

On July 26, 2023, the SEC adopted the Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure rule which was designed to encourage public companies to transparently and effectively manage cybersecurity risk.

====Climate disclosure rule====

In 2024, the SEC decided on a climate disclosure rule, The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors. It requires companies to disclose information on their risk to be impacted by climate change and a company&#x27;s risks to profit by a growing number of climate change regulations, concerning direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions produced.

== Whistleblower program ==
The SEC runs a whistleblower rewards program, which rewards individuals who report violations of securities laws to the SEC. The program began in 2011 with the passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and allows whistleblowers to be given 10–30% of the penalties collected by the SEC and other agencies as a result of the whistleblower&#x27;s information. As of 2021, the SEC had recovered $4.8 billion in monetary remedies as a result of information obtained through the whistleblower program and had paid out over $1 billion to whistleblowers. As part of the program, the SEC issues a report to Congress each year and the 2021 report is available online.

== Relationship to other agencies ==
In addition to working with various self-regulatory organizations such as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), and Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB), the SEC also works with federal agencies, state securities regulators, international securities agencies and law enforcement agencies.

In 1988, Executive Order 12631 established the president&#x27;s Working Group on Financial Markets. The Working Group is chaired by the secretary of the treasury and includes the chairman of the SEC, the chairman of the Federal Reserve and the chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The goal of the Working Group is to enhance the integrity, efficiency, orderliness, and competitiveness of the financial markets while maintaining investor confidence.

The Securities Act of 1933 was originally administered by the Federal Trade Commission. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 transferred this responsibility from the FTC to the SEC. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 also gave the SEC the power to regulate the solicitation of proxies, though some of the rules the SEC has since proposed (like the universal proxy) have been controversial.&#x27;&#x27; The main mission of the FTC is to promote consumer protection and to eradicate anti-competitive business practices. The FTC regulates general business practices, while the SEC focuses on the securities markets.

The Temporary National Economic Committee was established by joint resolution of Congress 52 Stat. 705 on June 16, 1938. It was in charge of reporting to Congress on abuses of monopoly power. The committee was defunded in 1941, but its records are still under seal by order of the SEC.

The Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB) was established in 1975 by Congress to develop rules for companies involved in underwriting and trading municipal securities. The MSRB is monitored by the SEC, but the MSRB does not have the authority to enforce its rules.

The Asset Management Advisory Committee (AMAC) was formally established on 1 November 2019, to provide the SEC with &quot;diverse perspectives on asset management and related advice and recommendations&quot;. Topics the committee may address include trends and developments affecting investors and market participants, the effects of globalization, and changes in the role of technology and service providers. The committee is composed of outside experts, including individuals representing the views of retail and institutional investors, small and large funds, intermediaries, and other market participants.

While most violations of securities laws are enforced by the SEC and the various SROs it monitors, state securities regulators can also enforce statewide securities blue sky laws. States may require securities to be registered in the state before they can be sold there. National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996 (NSMIA) addressed this dual system of federal-state regulation by amending Section 18 of the 1933 Act to exempt nationally traded securities from state registration, thereby pre-empting state law in this area. However, NSMIA preserves the states&#x27; anti-fraud authority over all securities traded in the state.

The SEC also works with federal and state law enforcement agencies to carry out actions against actors alleged to be in violation of the securities laws.

The SEC is a member of International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), and uses the IOSCO Multilateral Memorandum of Understanding as well as direct bilateral agreements with other countries&#x27; securities commissions to deal with cross-border misconduct in securities markets.

<text>Carnarvon National Park is located in the Southern Brigalow Belt bioregion in the Maranoa Region in Central Queensland, Australia. The park is 593 km northwest of Brisbane. It began life as a reserve gazetted in 1932 to protect Carnarvon Gorge for its outstanding scenic values, its Indigenous and non-Indigenous cultural heritage, and its geological significance.

==Rocks and landscapes==

Situated within the Central Queensland Sandstone Belt, and straddling the Great Dividing Range, Carnarvon National Park preserves and presents significant elements of Queensland&#x27;s geological history including two sedimentary basins, the Bowen and the Surat, and the Buckland Volcanic Province. The youngest rocks in the area are the igneous basalt rocks of the Buckland volcanic Province, which were laid down between 35 and 27 million years ago. Since that time, water and wind have eroded the park&#x27;s landscapes into a network of sandy plains, valleys, and gorges separated by basalt-capped tablelands and ranges.

The park is rich in groundwater, numerous springs. The elevated areas protected within Carnarvon National Park have high value for above-ground catchments as well. Five major river systems rise within the park&#x27;s boundary: the Comet, Dawson, Maranoa, Nogoa, and Warrego. The Warrego and Maranoa lie inland of the Great Dividing Range on the northern boundary of the Murray-Darling Basin.

==Flora==

Forty regional ecosystems are known to exist within the park and nine of them are listed as endangered, due to large-scale land clearing within the region. Twenty-three species of flora listed as rare and threatened (Under Queensland legislation) have been found in the park, including the iconic &quot;Livistona nitida&quot; (Carnarvon Fan Palm, Carnarvon Gorge section), &quot;Cadellia pentastylis&quot; (Ooline, Moolayember section), and &quot;Stemmacantha australis&quot; (Austral Cornflower, Mount Moffatt section).

Several plants occur in disjunct populations, or reach the limits of their distribution, within the Park such as the isolated colony of &quot;Angiopteris evecta&quot; (King Fern) found in Wards Canyon, Carnarvon Gorge. Artesian springs in the Salvator Rosa section of the park are considered amongst the most biodiverse in the state.

==Fauna==

Over 210 bird species have been recorded within Carnarvon National Park, along with about 60 species of mammals. This park is particularly rich in species of bats with at least twenty known to be there. The &quot;Ornithorhyncus anatinus&quot;, the platypus, is at its western limit of habitation in Queensland within this National Park, along with most of the park&#x27;s gliding possums. Carnarvon Gorge has commercial night tours that take visitors into the park in search of gliders and other nocturnal life.

At least 90 species of reptiles call this park home, over half of which are either skinks or geckoes, and 35 species have their State distributional limits here. Twenty-two species of amphibians have been found in the park, including isolated populations of &quot;Litoria fallax&quot; (eastern Sedgefrog) and &quot;Adelotus brevis&quot; (Tusked Frog).

Over ten species of fish inhabit the park&#x27;s waterways, the largest of which is &quot;Anguilla reinhardtii&quot; (long-finned eel). The park&#x27;s invertebrate fauna is thought to be extremely diverse, and at least nine species are considered to be endemic to the Carnarvon Range, including two species of dragonfly, two species of stonefly, a dobson fly, and four species of land snail.

Feral animals are present within the National Park, the ones presenting the most serious problems being brumbies and pigs. In 2007, culling of both species began by riflemen in helicopters or airplanes. In 2008 the third phase of an aerial culling of Brumbies took place, by shooting 700 horses from a helicopter, in Carnarvon National Park. Such aerial culling is a contentious issue to some members of the public. However, there is little doubt that both species cause considerable alteration to the values the park is designed to protect. Through their grazing and their repetitious patterns of movement, feral horses alter the composition of the ground cover, and this can accelerate erosion through over-grazing and excessive hoof traffic. Feral pigs are thought to be responsible for the localised extinction of the Australian brush-turkey from some areas of this National Park.

==History==

Carnarvon National Park has grown significantly since its inception, and Carnarvon Gorge is now but one of its seven sections.

* Goodlife
* Salvator Rosa
* Ka Ka Mundi
* Buckland Tableland
* Mount Moffatt
* Carnarvon Gorge
* Moolayember

In expanding the National Park, the Queensland National Parks and Wildlife Service have sought to enhance the reserves catchment value and increase the diversity of regional ecosystems protected within its boundaries. The park&#x27;s regional conservation importance is significant as its 298,000 hectares represents over half the total landmass of protected areas within the Southern Brigalow Belt bioregion.

===Human history===

Carnarvon National Park is significant to Bidjara, Karingbal, and Kara Kara people of Central Queensland. The park contains many reminders of Aboriginal cultural connection in rock art sites, burial places and occupation sites. Kenniff Cave, in the Mount Moffatt section, was the first Australian archaeological site to return carbon dates on occupational evidence that pushed human occupation of the continent into the Late Pleistocene at 19,500 years before present. Prior to D.J. Mulvaney&#x27;s excavation of Kenniff Cave, it was thought that Australia had only been occupied during the Holocene, fewer than 10,000 years before present.
The indigenous stencil artists of Central Queensland, such as those who created sites such as the Art Gallery and Cathedral Cave in Carnarvon Gorge, are regarded by some researchers as the best in the world. It appears they developed complex stencilling techniques that have not been replicated elsewhere. Only one full adult body stencil is known to exist in the world; it can be seen publicly at the Tombs site in the Mount Moffatt section of the park. It is the largest known stencil, and a good example of the heights to which this form of human expression was taken in Central Queensland.

Contemporary Indigenous culture in the park is much changed from that of pre-colonial Central Queensland; however strong Indigenous links to the landscapes within Carnarvon National Park are maintained through traditional owner involvement in the protection and preservation of the Park&#x27;s cultural sites.

The first European to traverse the future park was Thomas Mitchell, in the 1840s. Settlers followed in the footsteps of the explorers, lured by reports of the region&#x27;s permanent water. Altercations with local Indigenous groups soon broke out and escalated into a state of mutual aggression that was maintained until the 1870s.

The remoteness of the area during early settlement attracted some interesting local characters, some of whom came to the area to avoid unwanted official scrutiny. The Ward brothers hunted fur in the Carnarvons year round at a time when there were restricted open seasons. The Kenniff brothers (Kenniff Cave&#x27;s namesakes) became notorious local horse thieves, and later murderers.

Today, tourism, recreation, and conservation are the main human activities conducted on the park. The most popular section of the park is the Carnarvon Gorge section which receives an estimated 65,000 visitors per year. Mount Moffatt is the next most visited section, followed by Salvator Rosa and Ka Ka Mundi. The remaining sections of the park receive virtually no visitation at all, and are consequently high in wilderness values.

Carnarvon National Park offers a variety of recreational activities including four-wheel driving, wildlife watching, hiking along maintained tracks, and bush walking into remote areas. A ninety-kilometre-long trail is currently underway that will allow bush walkers to circumnavigate Carnarvon Gorge in around five days.

==Access==

The Carnarvon Gorge section is accessible from either Rolleston or Injune along the Carnarvon Highway. The Mount Moffatt section is accessible from either Injune or Mitchell. The Salvator Rosa and Ka Ka Mundi sections are accessible via the Tambo Road from either Tambo or Springsure.

<text>Pierre Henri Marie Schaeffer ( , ; 14 August 1910 – 19 August 1995) was a French composer, writer, broadcaster, engineer, musicologist, acoustician and founder of Groupe de Recherche de Musique Concrète (GRMC). His innovative work in both the sciences—particularly communications and acoustics—and the various arts of music, literature and radio presentation after the end of World War II, as well as his anti-nuclear activism and cultural criticism garnered him widespread recognition in his lifetime.

Schaeffer is most widely and currently recognized for his accomplishments in electronic and experimental music, at the core of which stands his role as the chief developer of a unique and early form of avant-garde music known as musique concrète. The genre emerged in Europe from the utilization of new music technology developed in the post-war era, following the advance of electroacoustic and acousmatic music.

Schaeffer&#x27;s writings (which include written and radio-narrated essays, biographies, short novels, a number of musical treatises and several plays) are often oriented towards his development of the genre, as well as the theoretics and philosophy of music in general.

Today, Schaeffer is considered one of the most influential experimental, electroacoustic and subsequently electronic musicians, having been the first composer to develop a number of recording and sampling techniques that are ubiquitous in modern sound and music production . His collaborative endeavors are considered milestones in the histories of electronic and experimental music.

== Life ==
=== Early life and education ===
Schaeffer was born in Nancy in 1910. His parents were both musicians (his father was a violinist; his mother, a singer), and at first it seemed that Pierre would also take on music as a career. However, his parents discouraged his musical pursuits from childhood and had him educated in engineering. He studied at several universities in this inclination, the first of which was Lycée Saint-Sigisbert, located in his hometown of Nancy. Afterwards he moved westwards in 1929 to the École Polytechnique in Paris and finally completed his education in the capital at the École supérieure d&#x27;électricité, in 1934.

Schaeffer received a diploma in radio broadcasting from the École Polytechnique. He may have also received a similar qualification from the École nationale supérieure des télécommunications, although it is not verifiable as to whether or not he ever actually attended this university.

=== Early experimentation ===
Later in 1934 Schaeffer entered his first employment as an engineer, briefly working in telecommunications for the Postes et Télécommunications in Strasbourg. In 1935 he began a relationship with a woman named Elisabeth Schmitt, and later in the year married her and with her had his first child, Marie-Claire Schaeffer. He and his new family then officially relocated to Paris in 1936 where began his work in radio broadcasting and presentation. It was there that he began to move away from his initial interests in telecommunications and to pursue music instead, combining his abilities as an engineer with his passion for sound. In his work at the station, Schaeffer experimented with records and an assortment of other devices—the sounds they made and the applications of those sounds—after convincing the radio station&#x27;s management to allow him to use their equipment. This period of experimentation was significant for Schaeffer&#x27;s development, bringing forward many fundamental questions he had on the limits of modern musical expression.
In these experiments, Pierre tried playing sounds backwards, slowing them down, speeding them up and juxtaposing them with other sounds, all techniques which were virtually unknown at that time. He had begun working with new contemporaries whom he had met through RTF, and as such his experimentation deepened. Schaeffer&#x27;s work gradually became more avant-garde, as he challenged traditional musical style with the use of various devices and practices. Eventually, a unique variety of electronic instruments—ones which Schaeffer and his colleagues created, using their own engineering skills—came into play in his work, like the chromatic, sliding and universal phonogenes, François Bayle&#x27;s Acousmonium and a host of other devices such as gramaphones and some of the earliest tape recorders.

=== Beginnings of writing career ===
In 1938 Schaeffer began his career as a writer, penning various articles and essays for the &quot;Revue Musicale&quot;, a French journal of music. His first column, &quot;Basic Truths&quot;, provided a critical examination of musical aspects of the time.

An ardent Catholic, Schaeffer began to write religiously based pieces, and in the same year as his &quot;Basic Truths&quot; he published his first novel: &quot;Chlothar Nicole&quot; — a short Christian novel.

=== Club d&#x27;essai and the origin of musique concrète ===
The Studio d&#x27;Essai, later Club d&#x27;Essai, was founded in 1942 by Pierre Schaeffer at the Radiodiffusion Nationale (France). It played a role in the activities of the French resistance during World War II, and later became a center of musical activity.

=== Groupe de Recherche de Musique Concrète ===
In 1949, Schaeffer met the percussionist-composer Pierre Henry, with whom he collaborated on many compositions, and in 1951, he founded the &quot;Groupe de Recherche de Musique Concrète&quot; (GRMC) in the French Radio Institution. This gave him a new studio, which included a tape recorder. This was a significant development for Schaeffer, who previously had to work with phonographs and turntables to produce music. Schaeffer is generally acknowledged as being the first composer to make music using magnetic tape. His continued experimentation led him to publish &quot;À la Recherche d&#x27;une Musique Concrète&quot; (French for &quot;&quot;In Search of a Concrete Music&quot;) in 1952, which was a summation of his working methods up to that point. His only opera, &quot;Orphée 53&quot; (&quot;Orpheus 53&quot;&quot;), premiered in 1953.

Schaeffer left the GRMC in 1953 and reformed the group in 1958 as the &quot;Groupe de Recherche Musicale[s]&quot; (GRM) (at first without &quot;s&quot;, then with &quot;s&quot;).

In 1954 Schaeffer founded traditional music label Ocora (&quot;Office de Coopération Radiophonique&quot;) alongside composer, pianist, and musicologist Charles Duvelle, with a worldwide coverage in order to preserve African rural soundscapes. Ocora also served as a facility to train technicians in African national broadcasting services.

Over the years, Schaeffer mentored a number of students who went on to have successful careers, including Éliane Radigue and the young Jean Michel Jarre, who called his mentor the first disc jockey. His last &quot;&quot;étude&quot; (&quot;study&quot;) came in 1959: the &quot;Study of Objects&quot;&quot; (&quot;Études aux Objets&quot;).

=== Later life and death ===
Schaeffer became an associate professor at the Paris Conservatoire from 1968 to 1980 after creating a &quot;class of fundamental music and application to the audiovisual.&quot;

In the aftermath of the 1988 Armenian earthquake, the 78-year-old Schaeffer led a 498-member French rescue team to look for survivors in Leninakan, and worked there until all foreign personnel were asked to leave.

Schaeffer suffered from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease later in his life, and died from the condition in Aix-en-Provence in 1995. He was 85 years old. He is buried in Delincourt in the green Vexin region (55 minutes from Paris) where he used to have his countryside property.

Schaeffer was thereafter remembered by many of his colleagues with the title, &quot;Musician of Sounds&quot;.

== Legacy ==
=== Musique concrète ===


The term musique concrète (French for &quot;real music&quot;, literally &quot;concrete music&quot;), was coined by Schaeffer in 1948. Schaeffer believed traditionally classical (or as he called it, &quot;serious&quot;) music begins as an abstraction (musical notation) that is later produced as audible music. Musique concrète, by contrast, strives to start with the &quot;concrete&quot; sounds that emanate from base phenomena and then abstracts them into a composition. The term musique concrète is then, in essence, the breaking down of the structured production of traditional instruments, harmony, rhythm, and even music theory itself, in an attempt to reconstruct music from the bottom up.

From the contemporary point of view, the importance of Schaeffer&#x27;s musique concrète is threefold. He developed the concept of including any and all sounds into the vocabulary of music. At first he concentrated on working with sounds other than those produced by traditional musical instruments. Later on, he found it was possible to remove the familiarity of musical instrument sounds and abstract them further by techniques such as removing the attack of the recorded sound. He was among the first musicians to manipulate recorded sound for the purpose of using it in conjunction with other sounds in order to compose a musical piece. Techniques such as tape looping and tape splicing were used in his research, often comparing to sound collage. The advent of Schaeffer&#x27;s manipulation of recorded sound became possible only with technologies that were developed after World War II had ended in Europe. His work is recognized today as an essential precursor to contemporary sampling practices. Schaeffer was among the first to use recording technology in a creative and specifically musical way, harnessing the power of electronic and experimental instruments in a manner similar to Luigi Russolo, whom he admired and from whose work he drew inspiration.

Furthermore, he emphasized the importance of &quot;playing&quot; (in his term, &quot;jeu&quot;) in the creation of music. Schaeffer&#x27;s idea of &quot;jeu&quot; comes from the French verb &quot;jouer&quot;, which carries the same double meaning as the English verb play: &#x27;to enjoy oneself by interacting with one&#x27;s surroundings&#x27;, as well as &#x27;to operate a musical instrument&#x27;. This notion is at the core of the concept of musique concrète, and reflects on freely improvised sound, or perhaps more specifically electroacoustic improvisation, from the standpoint of Schaeffer&#x27;s work and research.

=== Influences on music ===
In 1955, Éliane Radigue, an apprentice of Pierre Schaeffer at Studio d&#x27;Essai, learned to cut, splice and edit tape using his techniques. She then went on to work as an assistant to Pierre Henry in 1967. However, she became more interested in tape feedback and began working on her own pieces. She composed several works (&quot;Jouet Electronique&quot; [1967], &quot;Elemental I&quot; [1968], &quot;Stress-Osaka&quot; [1969]&quot;, Usral&quot; [1969]&quot;, Ohmnht&quot; [1970] &quot;Vice Versa, etc&quot; [1970]) by processing the feedback between two tape recorders and a microphone.

Pierre&#x27;s GRM student Jean Michel Jarre went on to great international success. Jarre&#x27;s 1997 album Oxygene 7-13 is dedicated to Schaeffer. Pierre Henry also made a tribute to the man, composing his &quot;Écho d&#x27;Orphée, Pour P. Schaeffer&quot; alongside him for Schaeffer&#x27;s last work and second compilation, &quot;L&#x27;Œuvre Musicale&quot;. His other notable pupils include Joanna Bruzdowicz, Jorge Antunes, Bernard Parmegiani, Micheline Coulombe Saint-Marcoux, Armando Santiago, Elzbieta Sikora.

In the early 1980s, Pierre Schaeffer distanced himself from the contemporary musical scene after criticizing the avant-garde of the 1950s, which intended to break with tradition. Schaeffer recognized the virtuoso Otavio Henrique Soares Brandão as his most faithful disciple, who under his guidance performed a reading of his work &quot;Traité des Objets Musicaux&quot;. This reading aims to create an innovative piano and musical instrumental technique that does not break with tradition. Pierre Schaeffer wrote four texts on the topic: &quot;Apropos de la Transcription pour Piano par Otavio Brandão de l&#x27;Étude aux Objets&quot; (1988); &quot;Réponse à Otávio&quot;, in text of the program of the Soares Brandão concert at Salle Pleyel in honor of Schaeffer&#x27;s eightieth birthday (1990); &quot;Declaration de Pierre Schaeffer sur Ibis et Otavio Soares Brandão&quot; (1990); and &quot;Déclaration de Pierre Schaeffer (Porte Parole)&quot; (1993).

Many rap albums, such as &quot;It Takes A Nation of Millions To Hold Us Back&quot; by Public Enemy and &quot;3 Feet High And Rising&quot; by De La Soul take ordinary sounds and use them to create a finished product.

=== Other ===
The Qwartz Electronic Music Awards has named several of its past events after Schaeffer. Pierre himself was a prize winner at the awards more than once.

== Works ==
=== Music ===
Commercial release of Schaeffer&#x27;s work was limited at best; Schaeffer released his work to the public primarily to disseminate a new and avant-garde form of music. The original production of his marketed work was done by the &quot;&quot;Groupe de Recherches Musicales&quot; (a.k.a. GRM; now owned and operated by INA or the &quot;Institut national de l&#x27;audiovisuel&quot;), the company which he initially had formed around his creations. Other music was broadcast live (Pierre himself being notable on French radio at the time). Some individual tracks found their way into the use of other artists, with Pierre&#x27;s work being fronted in mime performances and ballets. Now after his death, various musical production companies, such as &quot;Disques Adès&quot; and &quot;Phonurgia Nova&quot; have been granted rights to distribute his work.

=== Broadcast narratives ===
Apart from his published and publicized music, Schaeffer conducted several musical (and specifically musique concrète-related) presentations via French radio. Although these broadcasts contained musical pieces by Schaeffer they cannot be adequately described as part of his main line of musical output. This is because the radio &quot;essays&quot;&quot;, as they were appropriately named, were mainly narration on Schaeffer&#x27;s musical theories philosophies rather than compositions in and of themselves.

Schaeffer&#x27;s radio narratives include the following:
* &quot;The Shell Filled With Planets&quot; (1944)
* &quot;Cantata to Alsace&quot; (1945)
* &quot;An Hour of the World&quot; (1946)
* &quot;From Claudel to Brangues&quot; (1953)
* &quot;Ten Years of Radiophonic Experiments from the &#x27;Studio&#x27; to the &#x27;Club&#x27; d&#x27;Essai: 1942–1952&quot; (1955)

=== Selected writings ===

Schaeffer&#x27;s literary works, fiction and non-fiction, span a range of genres. He predominantly wrote treatises and essays, but also penned a film review and two plays. An ardent Catholic, Schaeffer wrote &quot;Chlothar Nicole&quot; (French: &quot;Clotaire Nicole&quot;; published 1938)—a Christian novel or short story—and &quot;Tobias&quot; (French: &quot;Tobie&quot;; published 1939) a religiously based play.

<text>World Brain is a collection of essays and addresses by the English science fiction pioneer, social reformer, evolutionary biologist and historian H. G. Wells, dating from the period of 1936–1938. Throughout the book, Wells describes his vision of the World Brain: a new, free, synthetic, authoritative, permanent &quot;World Encyclopaedia&quot; that could help world citizens make the best use of universal information resources and make the best contribution to world peace.

== Background ==

Plans for creating a global knowledge network long predate Wells. Andrew Michael Ramsay described, c. 1737, an objective of freemasonry as follows:

... to furnish the materials for a Universal Dictionary ... By this means the lights of all nations will be united in one single work, which will be a universal library of all that is beautiful, great, luminous, solid, and useful in all the sciences and in all noble arts. This work will augment in each century, according to the increase of knowledge.

The Encyclopedist movement in France in the mid-eighteenth century was a major attempt to actualize this philosophy. However, efforts to encompass all knowledge came to seem less possible as the available corpus expanded exponentially.

In 1926, extending the analogy between global telegraphy and the nervous system, Nikola Tesla speculated that:

Paul Otlet, a contemporary of Wells and information science pioneer, revived this movement in the twentieth century. Otlet wrote in 1935, &quot;Man would no longer need documentation if he were assimilated into a being that has become omniscient, in the manner of God himself.&quot; Otlet, like Wells, supported the internationalist efforts of the League of Nations and its International Institute of Intellectual Cooperation.

For his part, Wells had advocated world government for at least a decade, arguing in such books as &quot;The Open Conspiracy&quot; for control of education by a scientific elite.

==Synopsis==
In the wake of the first World War, Wells believed that people needed to become more educated and conversant with events and knowledge that surrounded them. In order to do this he offered the idea of the knowledge system of the World Brain that all humans could access.

=== World Encyclopedia ===
This section, Wells&#x27;s first expression of his dream of a World Brain, was delivered as a lecture at the , Weekly Evening Meeting, Friday, 20 November 1936.

Wells begins the lecture with a statement on his preference for cohesive worldviews rather than isolated facts. Correspondingly, he wishes the world to be such a whole &quot;as coherent and consistent as possible&quot;. He mentions &quot;The Work, Wealth and Happiness of Mankind&quot; (1931), one of his own attempts at providing intellectual synthesis, and calls it disappointingly unmatched.

He expresses dismay at the ignorance of social science among the Treaty of Versailles and League of Nations framers. He mentions some recent works on the role of science in society and states his main problem as follows:

We want the intellectual worker to become a more definitely organised factor in the human scheme. How is that factor to be organised? Is there any way of implementing knowledge for ready and universal effect?

In answer he introduces the doctrine of New Encyclopaedism as a framework for integrating intellectuals into an organic whole. For the ordinary man, who will necessarily be an educated citizen in the modern state:

From his point of view the World Encyclopaedia would be a row of volumes in his own home or in some neighbouring house or in a convenient public library or in any school or college, and in this row of volumes he would, without any great toil or difficulty, find in clear understandable language, and kept up to date, the ruling concepts of our social order, the outlines and main particulars in all fields of knowledge, an exact and reasonably detailed picture of our universe, a general history of the world, and if by any chance he wanted to pursue a question into its ultimate detail, a trustworthy and complete system of reference to primary sources of knowledge. In fields where wide varieties of method and opinion existed, he would find, not casual summaries of opinions, but very carefully chosen and correlated statements and arguments. [...] This World Encyclopaedia would be the mental background of every intelligent man in the world. It would be alive and growing and changing continually under revision, extension and replacement from the original thinkers in the world everywhere. Every university and research institution should be feeding it. Every fresh mind should be brought into contact with its standing editorial organisation. And on the other hand its contents would be the standard source of material for the instructional side of school and college work, for the verification of facts and the testing of statements—everywhere in the world. Even journalists would deign to use it; even newspaper proprietors might be made to respect it.

Such an encyclopedia would be akin to a secular bible. Universal acceptance would be possible due to the underlying similarity of human brains. For specialists and intellectuals, the World Encyclopedia will provide valuable coordination with other intellectuals working in similar areas.

Wells calls for the formation of an Encyclopaedia Society to promote the project and defend it from exploitation (e.g. by an &quot;enterprising publisher&quot; trying to profit from it). This society would also organize departments for production. Of course, the existence of a society has its own risks:

And there will be a constant danger that some of the early promoters may feel and attempt to realise a sort of proprietorship in the organisation, to make a group or a gang of it. But to recognise that danger is half-way to averting it.

The language of the World Encyclopedia would be English because of its greater range, precision, and subtlety.

Intellectual workers across the world would be increasingly bound together through their participation.

Wells wishes that wise world citizens would ensure world peace. He suggests that a world intellectual project will have more positive impact to this end than will any political movement such as communism, fascism, imperialism, pacifism, etc.

He ended his lecture as follows:

[W]hat I am saying ... is this, that without a World Encyclopaedia to hold men&#x27;s minds together in something like a common interpretation of reality, there is no hope whatever of anything but an accidental and transitory alleviation of any of our world troubles.

=== The Brain Organization of the Modern World ===
This section was first delivered as a lecture in America, October and November 1937.

This lecture promotes the doctrine New Encyclopedism described previously. Wells begins with the observation that the world has become a single interconnected community due to the enormously increased speed of telecommunications. Secondly, he says that energy is available on a new scale, enabling, among other things, the capability for mass destruction. Consequently, the establishment of a new world order is imperative:

One needs an exceptional stupidity even to question the urgency we are under to establish some effective World Pax, before gathering disaster overwhelms us. The problem of reshaping human affairs on a world-scale, this World problem, is drawing together an ever-increasing multitude of minds.

Neither Christianity nor socialism can solve the World Problem. The solution is a modernized &quot;World Knowledge Apparatus&quot;—the World Encyclopedia—&quot;a sort of mental clearing house for the mind, a depot where knowledge and ideas are received, sorted, summarized, digested, clarified and compared&quot;. Wells thought that technological advances such as microfilm could be used towards this end so that &quot;any student, in any part of the world, will be able to sit with his projector in his own study at his or her convenience to examine &quot;any&quot; book, &quot;any&quot; document, in an exact replica&quot;.

In this lecture Wells develops the analogy of the encyclopedia to a brain, saying, &quot;it would be a clearing house for universities and research institutions; it would play the role of a cerebral cortex to these essential ganglia&quot;.

He mentions the International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation, an advisory branch of the League of Nations, and the 1937 World Congress of Universal Documentation as contemporary forerunners of the world brain.

=== A Permanent World Encyclopedia ===
This section was first published in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, April 1937, and contributed to the new &quot;Encyclopédie française&quot;, August 1937.

In this essay, Wells explains how current encyclopaedias have failed to adapt to both the growing increase in recorded knowledge and the expansion of people requiring information that was accurate and readily accessible. He asserts that these 19th-century encyclopaedias continue to follow the 18th-century pattern, organisation and scale. &quot;Our contemporary encyclopedias are still in the coach-and-horse phase of development,&quot; he argued, &quot;rather than in the phase of the automobile and the aeroplane&quot;.

Wells saw the potential for world-altering impacts this technology could bring. He felt that the creation of the encyclopaedia could bring about the peaceful days of the past, &quot;with a common understanding and the conception of a common purpose, and of a commonwealth such as now we hardly dream of&quot;.

Wells anticipated the effect and contribution that his World Brain would have on the university system as well. He wanted to see universities contributing to it, helping it grow, and feeding its search for holistic information. &quot;Every university and research institution should be feeding it&quot; (p. 14). Elsewhere Wells wrote: &quot;It would become the logical nucleus of the world&#x27;s research universities and post-graduate studies.&quot; He suggested that the organization he was proposing &quot;would outgrow in scale and influence alike any single university that exists, and it would inevitably take the place of the loose-knit university system of the world in the concentration of research and thought and the direction of the general education of mankind&quot;. In fact the new encyclopedism he was advocating was &quot;the only possible method I can imagine, of bringing the universities and research institutions around the world into effective cooperation and creating an intellectual authority sufficient to control and direct collective life&quot;. Ultimately the World Encyclopaedia would be &quot;a permanent institution, a mighty super-university, holding together, utilizing and dominating all of the teaching and research organizations at present in existence&quot;.

=== Speech to the Congrès Mondial De La Documentation Universelle ===
This section provides a brief excerpt of Wells&#x27;s speech at the World Congress of Universal Documentation, 20 August 1937. He tells the participants directly that they are participating in the creation of a world brain. He says:

 I am speaking of a process of mental organisation throughout the world which I believe to be as inevitable as anything can be in human affairs. The world has to pull its mind together, and this is the beginning of its effort. The world is a Phoenix. It perishes in flames and even as it dies it is born again. This synthesis of knowledge is the necessary beginning to the new world.

=== The Informative Content of Education ===
This section was delivered as the Presidential Address to the Educational Science Section of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, 2 September 1937.

Wells expresses his dismay at the general state of public ignorance, even among the educated, and suggest that the Educational Science Section focus on the bigger picture:

For this year I suggest we give the questions of drill, skills, art, music, the teaching of languages, mathematics and other symbols, physical, aesthetic, moral and religious training and development, a rest, and that we concentrate on the inquiry: What are we telling young people directly about the world in which they are to live?

He asks how the &quot;irreducible minimum of knowledge&quot; can be imparted to all people within ten years of education—realistically, he says, amounting to 2400 hours of classroom instruction. He suggests minimizing the teaching of names and dates in British history and focusing instead on newly available information about prehistory, early civilisation (without the traditionally heavy emphasis on Palestine and the Israelites), and the broad contours of world history. He suggests better education in geography, with an inventory of the world&#x27;s natural resources, and a better curriculum in money and economics. He calls for a &quot;modernised type of teacher&quot;, better paid, with better equipment, and continually updated training.

== Influence ==

===1930s: World Congress of Universal Documentation===

One of the stated goals of this Congress, held in Paris, France, in 1937, was to discuss ideas and methods for implementing Wells&#x27;s ideas of the World Brain. Wells himself gave a lecture at the Congress.

Reginald Arthur Smith extended Wells&#x27;s ideas in the book &quot;A Living Encyclopædia: A Contribution to Mr. Wells&#x27;s New Encyclopædism&quot; (London: Andrew Dakers Ltd., 1941).

=== 1960s: The World Brain as a supercomputer ===

==== From World Library to World Brain ====
In his 1962 book &quot;Profiles of the Future&quot;, Arthur C. Clarke predicted that the construction of what H. G. Wells called the World Brain would take place in two stages. He identified the first stage as the construction of the &quot;World Library&quot;, which is basically Wells&#x27;s concept of a universal encyclopaedia accessible to everyone from their home on computer terminals. He predicted this phase would be established (at least in the developed countries) by the year 2000. The second stage, the &quot;World Brain&quot;, would be a superintelligent artificially intelligent supercomputer that humans would be able to mutually interact with to solve various world problems. The &quot;World Library&quot; would be incorporated into the &quot;World Brain&quot; as a subsection of it. He suggested that this supercomputer should be installed in the former war rooms of the United States and the Soviet Union once the superpowers had matured enough to agree to co-operate rather than conflict with each other. Clarke predicted the construction of the &quot;World Brain&quot; would be completed by the year 2100.

In 1964, Eugene Garfield published an article in the journal &quot;Science&quot; introducing the Science Citation Index; the article&#x27;s first sentence invoked Wells&#x27;s &quot;magnificent, if premature, plea for the establishment of a world information center&quot;, and Garfield predicted that the Science Citation Index &quot;is a harbinger of things to come—a forerunner of the World Brain&quot;.

=== 1990s: World Wide Web of documents ===

==== World Wide Web as a World Brain ====
Brian R. Gaines in his 1996 paper &quot;Convergence to the Information Highway&quot; saw the World Wide Web as an extension of Wells&#x27;s &quot;World Brain&quot; that individuals can access using personal computers. In papers published in 1996 and 1997 (that did not cite Wells), Francis Heylighen and Ben Goertzel envisaged the further development of the World Wide Web into a global brain, i.e. an intelligent network of people and computers at the planetary level. The difference between &quot;global brain&quot; and &quot;world brain&quot; is that the latter, as envisaged by Wells, is centrally controlled, while the former is fully decentralised and self-organizing.

In 2001, Doug Schuler, a professor at Evergreen State University, proposed a worldwide civic intelligence network as the fulfillment of Wells&#x27;s world brain. As examples he cited Sustainable Seattle and the &quot;Technology Healthy City&quot; project in Seattle.

====Wikipedia as a World Brain====

A number of commentators have suggested that Wikipedia represents the World Brain as described by Wells. Joseph Reagle has compared Wells&#x27;s warning about the need to defend the World Encyclopedia from propaganda with Wikipedia&#x27;s norm:

In keeping with the universal vision, and anticipating a key Wikipedia norm, H. G. Wells was concerned that his &quot;World Brain&quot; be an &quot;encyclopedia appealing to all mankind&quot;, and therefore it must remain open to corrective criticism, be skeptical of myths (no matter how &quot;venerated&quot;) and guard against &quot;narrowing propaganda&quot;. This strikes me as similar to the pluralism inherent in the Wikipedia &quot;Neutral Point of View&quot; goal of &quot;representing significant views fairly, proportionately, and without bias&quot;.

<doc id="55106" wikidata="Q217964" url="?curid=55106" title="LZ 129 Hindenburg">
<text>LZ 129 &quot;Hindenburg&quot; (; Registration: D-LZ 129) was a German commercial passenger-carrying rigid airship, the lead ship of its class, the longest class of flying machine and the largest airship by envelope volume. It was designed and built by the Zeppelin Company (&quot;Luftschiffbau Zeppelin GmbH&quot;) on the shores of Lake Constance in Friedrichshafen, Germany, and was operated by the German Zeppelin Airline Company (&quot;Deutsche Zeppelin-Reederei&quot;). It was named after Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg, who was President of Germany from 1925 until his death in 1934.

The airship flew from March 1936 until it was destroyed by fire 14 months later on May 6, 1937, while attempting to land at Lakehurst Naval Air Station in Manchester Township, New Jersey, at the end of the first North American transatlantic journey of its second season of service. This was the last of the great airship disasters; it was preceded by the crashes of the British R38, the US airship &quot;Roma&quot;, the French &quot;Dixmude&quot;, the USS &quot;Shenandoah&quot;, the British R101, and the USS &quot;Akron&quot;.

==Design and development==
The Zeppelin Company had proposed &quot;LZ 128&quot; in 1929, after the world flight of the LZ 127 &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot;. This ship was to be approximately long and carry of hydrogen. Ten Maybach engines were to power five tandem engine cars (a plan from 1930 showed only four). The disaster of the British airship &quot;R 101&quot; prompted the Zeppelin Company to reconsider the use of hydrogen, therefore scrapping the LZ 128 in favour of a new airship designed for helium, the LZ 129. Initial plans projected the LZ 129 to have a length of , but was dropped from the tail in order to allow the ship to fit in Lakehurst Hangar No. 1.

Manufacturing of components began in 1931, but construction of the &quot;Hindenburg&quot; did not commence until March 1932. The delay was largely due to Daimler-Benz designing and refining the LOF-6 diesel engines to reduce weight while fulfilling the output requirements set by the Zeppelin Company.

&quot;Hindenburg&quot; had a duralumin structure, incorporating 15 Ferris wheel-like main ring bulkheads along its length, with 16 cotton gas bags fitted between them. The bulkheads were braced to each other by longitudinal girders placed around their circumferences. The airship&#x27;s outer skin was of cotton doped with a mixture of reflective materials intended to protect the gas bags within from radiation, both ultraviolet (which would damage them) and infrared (which might cause them to overheat). The gas cells were made by a new method pioneered by Goodyear using multiple layers of gelatinized latex rather than the previous goldbeater&#x27;s skins. In 1931 the Zeppelin Company purchased of duralumin salvaged from the wreckage of the October 1930 crash of the British airship R101.


&quot;Hindenburg&quot;″s interior furnishings were designed by Fritz August Breuhaus, whose design experience included Pullman coaches, ocean liners, and warships of the German Navy. The upper &quot;A&quot; Deck contained 25 small two-passenger cabins in the middle flanked by large public rooms: a dining room to port and a lounge and writing room to starboard. Paintings on the dining room walls portrayed the &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot;″s trips to South America. A stylized world map covered the wall of the lounge. Long slanted windows ran the length of both decks. The passengers were expected to spend most of their time in the public areas, rather than their cramped cabins.

The lower &quot;B&quot; Deck contained washrooms, a mess hall for the crew, and a smoking lounge. Harold G. Dick, an American representative from the Goodyear Zeppelin Company, recalled &quot;The only entrance to the smoking room, which was pressurized to prevent the admission of any leaking hydrogen, was via the bar, which had a swiveling air lock door, and all departing passengers were scrutinized by the bar steward to make sure they were not carrying out a lit cigarette or pipe.&quot;

===Use of hydrogen instead of helium===
Helium was initially selected for the lifting gas because it was the safest to use in airships, as it is not flammable. One proposed measure to save helium was to make double-gas cells for 14 of the 16 gas cells; an inner hydrogen cell would be protected by an outer cell filled with helium, with vertical ducting to the dorsal area of the envelope to permit separate filling and venting of the inner hydrogen cells. At the time, however, helium was also relatively rare and extremely expensive as the gas was available in industrial quantities only from distillation plants at certain oil fields in the United States. Hydrogen, by comparison, could be cheaply produced by any industrialized nation and being lighter than helium also provided more lift. Because of its expense and rarity, American rigid airships using helium were forced to conserve the gas at all costs and this hampered their operation.

Despite a U.S. ban on the export of helium under the Helium Control Act of 1927, the Germans designed the airship to use the far safer gas in the belief that they could convince the U.S. government to license its export. When the designers learned that the National Munitions Control Board refused to lift the export ban, they were forced to re-engineer &quot;Hindenburg&quot; to use flammable hydrogen gas, which was the only alternative lighter-than-air gas that could provide sufficient lift. One of the side benefits of being forced to utilize the flammable yet lighter hydrogen was that more passenger cabins could be added.

==Operational history==

===Launching and trial flights===

Four years after construction began in 1932, &quot;Hindenburg&quot; made its maiden test flight from the Zeppelin dockyards at Friedrichshafen on March 4, 1936, with 87 passengers and crew aboard. These included the Zeppelin Company chairman, Dr. Hugo Eckener, as commander, former World War I Zeppelin commander Lt. Col. Joachim Breithaupt representing the German Air Ministry, the Zeppelin Company&#x27;s eight airship captains, 47 other crew members, and 30 dockyard employees who flew as passengers. Harold G. Dick was the only non-Luftschiffbau representative aboard. Although the name &quot;Hindenburg&quot; had been quietly selected by Eckener over a year earlier, only the airship&#x27;s formal registration number (D-LZ129) and the five Olympic rings (promoting the 1936 Summer Olympics to be held in Berlin that August) were displayed on the hull during its trial flights. As the airship passed over Munich on its second trial flight the next afternoon, the city&#x27;s Lord Mayor, Karl Fiehler, asked Eckener by radio the LZ129&#x27;s name, to which he replied &quot;Hindenburg&quot;. On March 23, &quot;Hindenburg&quot; made its first passenger and mail flight, carrying 80 reporters from Friedrichshafen to Löwenthal. The ship flew over Lake Constance with &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot;.

The name &quot;Hindenburg&quot; lettered in high red Fraktur script (designed by Berlin advertiser Georg Wagner) was added to its hull three weeks later before the &quot;Deutschlandfahrt&quot; on March 26. No formal naming ceremony for the airship was ever held. 

The airship was operated commercially by the Deutsche Zeppelin Reederei (DZR) GmbH, which had been established by Hermann Göring in March 1935 to increase Nazi influence over airship operations. The DZR was jointly owned by the Luftschiffbau Zeppelin (the airship&#x27;s builder), the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (German Air Ministry), and Deutsche Lufthansa A.G. (Germany&#x27;s national airline at that time), and also operated the LZ 127 &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; during its last two years of commercial service to South America from 1935 to 1937. &quot;Hindenburg&quot; and its sister ship, the LZ 130 &quot;Graf Zeppelin II&quot; (launched in September 1938), were the only two airships ever purpose-built for regular commercial transatlantic passenger operations, although the latter never entered passenger service before being scrapped in 1940.

After a total of six flights made over a three-week period from the Zeppelin dockyards where the airship had been built, &quot;Hindenburg&quot; was over Hugo Eckener&#x27;s for a formal public debut in a Nazi Party propaganda flight around Germany (&quot;Die Deutschlandfahrt&quot;) made jointly with the &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; from March 26 to 29. This was to be followed by its first commercial passenger flight, a four-day transatlantic voyage to Rio de Janeiro that departed from the Friedrichshafen Airport in nearby Löwenthal on March 31. After again departing from Löwenthal on 6 May on its first of ten round trips to North America made in 1936, all &quot;Hindenburg&quot;″s subsequent transatlantic flights to both North and South America originated at the airport at Frankfurt am Main.

===&quot;Die Deutschlandfahrt&quot;===
Although designed and built for commercial transatlantic passenger, air freight, and mail service, at the behest of the Reich Ministry for Public Enlightenment and Propaganda (&quot;Reichsministerium für Volksaufklärung und Propaganda&quot; or &quot;Propagandaministerium&quot;), &quot;Hindenburg&quot; was first pressed into use by the Air Ministry (its DLZ co-operator) as a vehicle for the delivery of Nazi propaganda. On March 7, 1936, ground forces of the German Reich had entered and occupied the Rhineland, a region bordering France, which had been designated in the 1919 Treaty of Versailles as a de-militarized zone established to provide a buffer between Germany and that neighboring country.

In order to justify its remilitarization—which was also a violation of the 1925 Locarno Pact—a &quot;post hoc&quot; referendum was quickly called by Hitler for March 29 to &quot;ask the German people&quot; to both ratify the Rhineland&#x27;s occupation by the German Army, and to approve a single party list composed exclusively of Nazi candidates to sit in the new Reichstag. The &quot;Hindenburg&quot; and the &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; were designated by the government as a key part of the process. As a public relations ploy, Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels demanded that the Zeppelin Company make the two airships available for a tour of Germany (Deutschlandfahrt), flying &quot;in tandem&quot; around Germany over the four-day period prior to the voting with a joint departure from Löwenthal on the morning of March 26.

The Zeppelin Company chairman, Dr. Hugo Eckener, disapproved of this propaganda use of his craft. According to American reporter William L. Shirer, &quot;Hugo Eckener, who is getting [the Hindenburg] ready for its maiden flight to Brazil, strenuously objected to putting it in the air this weekend on the ground it was not fully tested, but Dr. Goebbels insisted. Eckener, no friend of the regime, refused to take it up himself, but allowed Captain [Ernst] Lehmann to. [Goebbels] is reported howling mad and is determined to get Eckener.&quot;

While gusty wind conditions on the morning March 26 threatened a safe launch of the new airship, &quot;Hindenburg&quot;″s commander, Captain Ernst Lehmann, was determined to impress the politicians, Nazi party officials, and press present at the airfield with an &quot;on time&quot; departure and thus proceeded with its launch despite the adverse conditions. As the massive airship began to rise under full engine power she was caught by a 35-degree crosswind gust, causing her lower vertical tail fin to strike and be dragged across the ground, resulting in significant damage to the bottom portion of the airfoil and its attached rudder. Hugo Eckener was furious and rebuked Lehmann.

&quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot;, which had been hovering above the airfield waiting for &quot;Hindenburg&quot; to join it, had to start off on the propaganda mission alone while LZ 129 returned to her hangar. There temporary repairs were quickly made to its empennage before joining up with the smaller airship several hours later. As millions of Germans watched from below, the two giants of the sky sailed over Germany for the next four days and three nights, dropping propaganda leaflets, blaring martial music and slogans from large loudspeakers, and broadcasting political speeches from a makeshift radio studio aboard &quot;Hindenburg&quot;.

On March 29, as German citizens voted overwhelmingly in favor of the Rhineland re-occupation, the &quot;Hindenburg&quot; was aloft over Berlin. Later, Hugo Eckener privately mocked Goebbels by telling friends, &quot;There were forty persons on the &quot;Hindenburg&quot;. Forty-two &#x27;yes&#x27; votes were counted.&quot; William Shirer recorded: &quot;Goebbels has forbidden the press to mention Eckener&#x27;s name.&quot;

===First commercial passenger flight===

With the completion of voting on the referendum (which the German Government claimed had been approved by a &quot;98.79% &#x27;Yes&#x27; vote&quot;), &quot;Hindenburg&quot; returned to Löwenthal on March 29 to prepare for its first commercial passenger flight, a transatlantic passage to Rio de Janeiro scheduled to depart from there on March 31. Hugo Eckener was not to be the commander of the flight, however, but was instead relegated to being a &quot;supervisor&quot; with no operational control over &quot;Hindenburg&quot; while Ernst Lehmann had command of the airship. To add insult to injury, Eckener learned from an Associated Press reporter upon &quot;Hindenburg&quot;″s arrival in Rio that Goebbels had also followed through on his month-old threat to decree that Eckener&#x27;s name would &quot;no longer be mentioned in German newspapers and periodicals&quot; and &quot;no pictures nor articles about him shall be printed.&quot; This action was taken because of Eckener&#x27;s opposition to using &quot;Hindenburg&quot; and &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; for political purposes during the &quot;Deutschlandfahrt&quot;, and his &quot;refusal to give a special appeal during the Reichstag election campaign endorsing Chancellor Adolf Hitler and his policies.&quot; The existence of the ban was never publicly acknowledged by Goebbels, and it was quietly lifted a month later.

While at Rio, the crew noticed one of the engines had noticeable carbon buildup from having been run at low speed during the propaganda flight days earlier. On the return flight from South America, the automatic valve for gas cell 3 stuck open. Gas was transferred from other cells through an inflation line. It was never understood why the valve stuck open, and subsequently the crew used only the hand-operated maneuvering valves for cells 2 and 3. Thirty-eight hours after departure, one of the airship&#x27;s four Daimler-Benz 16-cylinder diesel engines (engine car no. 4, the forward port engine) suffered a wrist pin breakage, damaging the piston and cylinder. Repairs were started immediately and the engine functioned on fifteen cylinders for the remainder of the flight. Four hours after engine 4 failed, engine no. 2 (aft port) was shut down, as one of two bearing cap bolts for the engine crankshaft failed and the cap fell into the crank case. The cap was removed and the engine was run again, but when the ship was off Cape Juby the second cap broke and the engine was shut down again. The engine was not run again to prevent further damage. With three engines operating at a speed of and headwinds reported over the English Channel, the crew raised the airship in search of counter-trade winds usually found above , well beyond the airship&#x27;s pressure altitude. Unexpectedly, the crew found such a wind at the lower altitude of which permitted them to guide the airship safely back to Germany after gaining emergency permission from France to fly a more direct route over the Rhone Valley. The nine-day flight covered in 203 hours and 32 minutes of flight time. All four engines were later overhauled and no further problems were encountered on later flights. For the rest of April, &quot;Hindenburg&quot; remained at its hangar where the engines were overhauled and the lower fin and rudder received a final repair; the ground clearance of the lower rudder was increased from 8 to 14 degrees.

===1936 transatlantic season===

&quot;Hindenburg&quot; made 17 round trips across the Atlantic in 1936—its first and only full year of service—with ten trips to the United States and seven to Brazil. The flights were considered demonstrative rather than routine in schedule. The first passenger trip across the North Atlantic left Frankfurt on 6 May with 56 crew and 50 passengers, arriving in Lakehurst, New Jersey on 9 May. As the elevation at Rhein-Main&#x27;s airfield lies at above sea level, the airship could lift more at takeoff there than she could from Friedrichshafen, which was situated at . Each of the ten westward trips that season took 53 to 78 hours and eastward took 43 to 61 hours. The last eastward trip of the year left Lakehurst on October 10; the first North Atlantic trip of 1937 ended in the &quot;Hindenburg&quot; disaster.

In May and June 1936, &quot;Hindenburg&quot; made surprise visits to England. In May it was on a flight from America to Germany when it flew low over the West Yorkshire town of Keighley. A parcel was then thrown overboard and landed in the High Street. Two boys, Alfred Butler and Jack Gerrard, retrieved it and found the contents to be a bouquet of carnations, a small silver cross and a letter on official note paper dated May 22, 1936. The letter read: &quot;To the finder of this letter, please deposit these flowers and cross on the grave of my dear brother, Lt. Franz Schulte, 1 Garde Regt, zu Fuss, POW in Skipton cemetery in Keighley near Leeds. Many thanks for your kindness. John P. Schulte, the first flying priest&quot;. Historian Oliver Denton speculates that the June visit may have had a more sinister purpose: to observe the industrial heartlands of Northern England.

In July 1936, &quot;Hindenburg&quot; completed a record Atlantic round trip between Frankfurt and Lakehurst in 98 hours and 28 minutes of flight time (52:49 westbound, 45:39 eastbound). Many prominent people were passengers on the &quot;Hindenburg&quot;, including boxer Max Schmeling making his triumphant return to Germany in June 1936 after his world heavyweight title knockout of Joe Louis at Yankee Stadium. In the 1936 season, the airship flew and carried 2,798 passengers and 160 tons of freight and mail, encouraging the &quot;Luftschiffbau Zeppelin&quot; Company to plan the expansion of its airship fleet and transatlantic service.

The airship was said to be so stable a pen or pencil could be balanced on end atop a table without falling. Launches were so smooth that passengers often missed them, believing the airship was still docked to the mooring mast. A one-way fare between Germany and the United States was US$400 (); &quot;Hindenburg&quot; passengers were affluent, usually entertainers, noted sportsmen, political figures, and leaders of industry. &quot;Hindenburg&quot; was used again for propaganda when it flew over the Olympic Stadium in Berlin on August 1 during the opening ceremonies of the 1936 Summer Olympic Games. Shortly before the arrival of Adolf Hitler to declare the Games open, the airship crossed low over the packed stadium while trailing the Olympic flag on a long weighted line suspended from its gondola. On September 14, the ship flew over the annual Nuremberg Rally.

On October 8, 1936, &quot;Hindenburg&quot; made a 10.5 hour flight (the &quot;Millionaires Flight&quot;) over New England carrying 72 wealthy and influential passengers including financier and future U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom Winthrop W. Aldrich, his 28-year-old nephew Nelson Rockefeller, who became the Governor of New York and, later, Vice President of the United States, various German and American government officials and military officers, as well as key figures in the aviation industry, including Juan Trippe, founder and Chief Executive of Pan American Airways, and World War I flying ace Captain Eddie Rickenbacker, president of Eastern Airlines. The ship arrived at Boston by noon and returned to Lakehurst at 5:22pm before making its final transatlantic flight of the season back to Frankfurt.

During 1936, &quot;Hindenburg&quot; had a Blüthner aluminium grand piano placed on board in the music salon, though the instrument was removed after the first year to save weight. Over the winter of 1936–37, several alterations were made to the airship&#x27;s structures. The greater lift capacity allowed nine passenger cabins to be added, eight with two beds and one with four, increasing passenger capacity to 70. These windowed cabins were along the starboard side aft of the previously installed accommodations, and it was anticipated for the LZ 130 to also have these cabins. Additionally, the Olympic rings painted on the hull were removed for the 1937 season.

&quot;Hindenburg&quot; also had an experimental aircraft hook-on trapeze similar to the one on the U.S. Navy Goodyear–Zeppelin built airships &quot;Akron&quot; and &quot;Macon&quot;. This was intended to allow customs officials to be flown out to &quot;Hindenburg&quot; to process passengers before landing and to retrieve mail from the ship for early delivery. Experimental hook-ons and takeoffs, piloted by Ernst Udet, were attempted on March 11 and April 27, 1937, but were not very successful, owing to turbulence around the hook-up trapeze. The loss of the ship ended all prospects of further testing.

==Final flight: May 3–6, 1937==

After making the first South American flight of the 1937 season in late March, &quot;Hindenburg&quot; left Frankfurt for Lakehurst on the evening of 3 May, on its first scheduled round trip between Europe and North America that season. Although strong headwinds slowed the crossing, the flight had otherwise proceeded routinely as it approached for a landing three days later.

&quot;Hindenburg&quot;″s arrival on 6 May was delayed for several hours to avoid a line of thunderstorms passing over Lakehurst, but around 7:00 pm the airship was cleared for its final approach to the Naval Air Station, which it made at an altitude of with Captain Max Pruss in command. At 7:21 pm a pair of landing lines were dropped from the nose of the ship and were grabbed hold of by ground handlers. Four minutes later, at 7:25 pm &quot;Hindenburg&quot; burst into flames and dropped to the ground in a little over half a minute. Of the 36 passengers and 61 crew aboard, 13 passengers and 22 crew died, as well as one member of the ground crew, a total of 36 lives lost. Herbert Morrison&#x27;s commentary of the incident became a classic of audio history.

The exact location of the initial fire, its source of ignition, and the source of fuel remain subjects of debate. The cause of the accident has never been determined conclusively, although many hypotheses have been proposed. Sabotage theories notwithstanding, one hypothesis often put forth involves a combination of gas leakage and atmospheric static conditions. Manually controlled and automatic valves for releasing hydrogen were located partway up one-meter diameter ventilation shafts that ran vertically through the airship. Hydrogen released into a shaft, whether intentionally or because of a stuck valve, would have mixed with air already in the potentially in an explosive ratio. Alternatively, a gas cell could have been ruptured by the breaking of a structural tension wire causing a mixing of hydrogen with air. The high static charge collected from flying within stormy conditions and inadequate grounding of the outer envelope to the frame could have ignited any resulting gas-air mixture at the top of the airship. In support of the hypothesis that hydrogen was leaking from the aft portion of the &quot;Hindenburg&quot; prior to the conflagration, water ballast was released at the rear of the airship and six crew members were dispatched to the bow to keep the craft level. 

Another more recent theory involves the airship&#x27;s outer covering. The silvery cloth covering contained material with cellulose nitrate, which is highly flammable. This theory is controversial and has been rejected by other researchers because the outer skin burns too slowly to account for the rapid flame propagation and gaps in the fire correspond with internal gas cell divisions, which would not be visible if the fire had spread across the skin first. Hydrogen fires had previously destroyed many other airships.

The duralumin framework of &quot;Hindenburg&quot; was salvaged and shipped back to Germany. There the scrap was recycled and used in the construction of military aircraft for the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, as were the frames of &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; and &quot;Graf Zeppelin II&quot; when they were scrapped in 1940.

==Appearances in media==

* Charlie Chan was a passenger aboard the &quot;Hindenburg&quot; in the 1937 film &quot;Charlie Chan at the Olympics&quot;.
* An image of the burning airship was used as the cover of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s self-titled debut album (1969).
* &quot;The Hindenburg&quot; is a 1975 film inspired by the disaster, but centered on the sabotage theory. Some of these plot elements were based on real bomb threats before the flight began, as well as proponents of the sabotage theory. The actual model from the movie is now on permanent display in the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C.
* In &quot;The Waltons&quot; 1977 episode &quot;The Inferno&quot;, John Boy Walton is sent by a publication to cover the New Jersey landing, and is traumatized by witnessing the event.
* &quot;Hindenburg: The Last Flight&quot; is a 2011 German TV miniseries directed by Philipp Kadelbach. Like the 1975 film, it also focuses on the sabotage theory; the plot is about a young engineer who uncovers a plot to blow up the Hindenburg while the German airship is preparing for its maiden voyage to America.

<doc id="55109" wikidata="Q1291186" url="?curid=55109" title="Alpine National Park">
<text>The Alpine National Park is a national park located in the Central Highlands and Alpine regions of Victoria, Australia. The national park is located northeast of Melbourne. It is the largest National Park in Victoria, and covers much of the higher areas of the Great Dividing Range in Victoria, including Victoria&#x27;s highest point, Mount Bogong at and the associated subalpine woodland and grassland of the Bogong High Plains. The park&#x27;s north-eastern boundary is along the border with New South Wales, where it abuts the Kosciuszko National Park. On 7 November 2008 the Alpine National Park was added to the Australian National Heritage List as one of eleven areas constituting the Australian Alps National Parks and Reserves.

==Ecology==

Ecologically, Alpine refers to areas where the environment is such that trees are unable to grow and vegetation is restricted to dwarfed shrubs, alpine grasses and ground-hugging herbs. In Victoria this is roughly those areas above . Below this is the sub-alpine zone, an area of open forest dominated by snow-gums, with significant areas of grasslands. This zone includes basins where cold air settles, restricting tree growth. In wetter areas these basins form Sphagnum bogs, which play an important role in the water cycle.

Water enters the alps as snow or rain. Bogs and frost hollows collect the water as snow melt and run off. A key element of these bogs is Sphagnum Moss, which acts as a sponge, absorbing up to twenty times its weight in water. These bogs then release the water over summer, ensuring creeks flow throughout most of the year maintaining the alps&#x27; creeks and streams. The greatest risk to this system is damage to the Sphagnum bogs. Trampling by feral animals (pigs, cattle, horses, humans) reduces their ability to absorb and then release water; instead of a steady release, water flows increase significantly in spring, leading to erosion and scouring of river beds, and ceases over summer and autumn, leading to localised drought. Fire can remove riparian vegetation, also increasing run-off and erosion.

Below the sub-alpine zone is the montane zone. On the alps southern fall, this exists as wet forest and rainforest, a consequence of the higher rainfall on this side of the park. Tall forests of Alpine Ash and Mountain Ash grow in deep soils while species like Mountain Gum are found in shallower soils or drier sites. The understory is usually shrubby, with a dense ground-layer of grasses, lilies, ferns and the like.

Rainforests are areas where the canopy cover is high, greater than 70%. The tree species are often specialists, such as Myrtle Beech in Cool Temperate Rainforest and Lilly Pilly in Warm Temperate Rainforest. Rainforest species are shade tolerant and able to regenerate below an undisturbed canopy or in small gaps created when a tree falls. Rainforest often merges with the surrounding, usually damp or wet, eucalypt forests. These forests are home to a diverse bird life and many mammals, some of which are restricted to a particular ecological niche within the ecosystem. This can include particular vegetation for foraging, or the presence of older trees with their larger hollows, a requirement for some arboreal mammals and birds. Rainforest species regenerate without fire and may be intolerant to fire, while other eucalypt species require fire. Fire can also affect the breeding of some mammals. Fire in Spring, for example, is considered to put juvenile Spot-tailed Quolls at risk. The montane zone on the alps drier, northern fall consists of dry forest and woodland with eucalypt species such as stringybarks, boxes and peppermints. Dry forest and woodlands also surround the wet forests on the southern side of the alps. These forests provide habitat for a wide range of species.

Dry forest and woodland abut private land in many areas and as a consequence have been subject to clearing, modification and fragmentation. Thus, the major threat in these areas is fire management (protection of private assets is a key objective and so past fire regimes may not reflect environmental needs), weed invasion and lack of connectivity between patches.

===Fauna===
The national park protects many threatened species, including the spotted tree frog, she-oak skink, smoky mouse, broad-toothed mouse and mountain pygmy possum.

Alpine Bogs and Associated Fens have now been listed as a threatened ecological community by the Australian government.

==Bushfires==
The park has been affected by bushfires with lightning strikes starting large fires in January 2003 and again in December 2006, each fire burning over over a number of weeks. The largest previous fire was the Black Friday fires of 1939. While fire is a feature of most Australian ecosystems, some alpine ecosystems, such as Alpine Bogs and Fens, are susceptible due to the sensitivity of the component species. The 2003 fires created a mosaic of burnt and unburnt areas. In some areas where the 2006-07 fires burnt over the same ground, species and communities have struggled to recover. A lightning strike on the slopes of Mount Feathertop near Harrietville in January 2013 started a bushfire which burnt for around two months.

==Agriculture==
For much of the European history of the national park, agricultural activity was conducted in the park, with quotas of cattle allowed to graze on the High Plains during summer. Australia&#x27;s alpine area was first used for grazing around the 1840s. Concerns about the environmental effects led various governments to remove grazing from parts of the alps over the next century. Grazing was temporarily halted in Mount Buffalo National Park in the 1920s and stopped altogether in 1952. Cattle were taken out of Kosciuszko National Park in NSW during the 1950s and 1960s due to concerns about the effect of grazing on water quality for the Snowy River Scheme. Grazing was also removed from Mounts Feathertop, Hotham and Bogong around this time, from around Mount Howitt in the 1980s, and from the northern Bogong High Plains, the Bluff and part of Davies Plains in the early 1990s, leaving about one third of the Alpine National Park – over – available for grazing. In 2005, the Victorian Government made the decision that cattle grazing would be banned in the remaining area of the Alpine National Park; although allowing grazing in adjacent state forest areas. When the Bracks Labor Victorian Government announced plans to end this grazing, the Howard coalition Federal Government floated the idea of using national cultural heritage powers to preserve grazing on the basis of the cultural place given to the mountain cattleman, notably through &quot;The Man from Snowy River&quot;.

For a period of over five years cattle were banned from the park, a decision which angered representative bodies of the graziers. As of January 2011 a group of cattlemen was permitted by Parks Victoria to return small numbers of cattle to fenced areas in the Alpine National Park. By 2013, fuel loads and weeds in the high plains had increased significantly and the Victorian Government sought Federal Government approval to remove the bans and commence a three-year trial to reinstate alpine grazing.

==Attractions==
This area is popular in summer for bushwalking, cross-country skiing, mountain biking, four wheel driving and fishing. The major drawcards are the cooler alpine weather and the stunning scenery created by the highest peaks in Victoria. Walking tracks lead to most peaks and many extended walks are possible. The Australian Alps Walking Track, which begins in Walhalla and extends north to Canberra, traverses the park. Bush camping is permitted within the park subject to Parks Victoria guidelines and seasonal restrictions.

In winter much of the area is snow-covered and only accessible on skis. Falls Creek and Mount Hotham are major downhill ski resorts adjacent to the national park from where cross-country skiers journey into the park to areas such as the Bogong High Plains and Mount Bogong.

Hunting is a popular winter activity, with the park open to stalking (hunting without dogs) of Sambar deer from mid-February to mid-December.

===Major peaks===
The following major peaks are located within the Alpine National Park, in order of descending elevation above sea level:

==Name==
In Serbian, the town is known as &quot;Sremski Karlovci&quot; (Сремски Карловци), in Croatian as &quot;Srijemski Karlovci&quot;, in German as &quot;Karlowitz&quot; or &quot;Carlowitz&quot;, in Hungarian as &quot;Karlóca&quot;, in Polish as &quot;Karłowice&quot;, in Romanian as &quot;Carloviț&quot; and in Turkish as &quot;Karlofça&quot;. The former Serbian name used for the town was &quot;Karlovci&quot; (Карловци), which is also used today, albeit unofficially. The name of the town in Serbian is plural.

==Geography==
The town is situated along the Danube River, about 12 km from Novi Sad and 75 km from Belgrade, in the geographical region of Syrmia. The town of Sremski Karlovci is the only settlement in the municipality.

==History==

===Ancient, medieval and early modern history===
In ancient times, the Romans maintained a small fortress at this location. The town was first mentioned in historical documents in 1308 with the name &quot;Karom&quot;. The medieval fortress of Karom was built on the ruins of the ancient Roman one. Until 1521, Karom was a possession of Hungarian noble families, of whom the most well known were Báthory and Morović.

In 1521, Turkish military commander Bali-beg conquered Karom under the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s invasion of Europe. During the next 170 years, the town was part of the Ottoman Empire. The Slavic name for the town – &quot;Karlovci&quot;, was first recorded in 1532/33. During Ottoman rule, the town was still predominately Serbian in ethnicity, with the smaller part of population composed of Muslims. According to the Ottoman defterler from 1545, the population of Karlovci numbered 547 Christian (Serb) houses. The city also had three Orthodox churches and a monastery. From 1557, it belonged to &quot;Eparchy of Belgrade and Srem&quot; of the Serbian Patriarchate of Peć.

===Habsburg Monarchy===

Between 16 November 1698 and 26 January 1699, the town of Karlovci was the site of a congress that ended the hostilities between the Ottoman Empire and the Holy League, a coalition of various European powers including Habsburg monarchy, Poland, Venice and Russia. The congress produced the Treaty of Karlowitz. It was the first time a round table was used in international politics.

After this peace treaty, the town was considered part of the Habsburg monarchy and was included in its Military Frontier. According to 1702 data, the population was composed of 215 Orthodox and 13 Catholic houses. By 1753, the population of the town numbered 3,843 people, of which 3,110 were classified as ethnic Serbs.

The town was the spiritual, political and cultural center of the Serbs in the Habsburg Monarchy. The Metropolitan of the Serbian Orthodox Church resided here. In the early 21st century, the Serbian Patriarch retains the title of Metropolitan of Karlovci.

The town had the earliest Serb (and Slavic in general) gymnasium (Serbian: &quot;gimnazija&quot;/, French: &quot;lycée&quot;), founded on 3 August 1791. Three years after this, the Orthodox seminary of Sremski Karlovci was founded here. It was the second-oldest Orthodox seminary in the world (after the Spiritual Academy in Kyiv), and it still operates.


At the Serb National Assembly in Karlovci in May 1848, Serbs declared the unification of the regions of Srem, Banat, Bačka, and Baranja (including parts of the Military Frontier) into the province of Serbian Vojvodina. In the late 18th century, the Habsburg monarchy had invited numerous settlers from Bavaria and southern Germany into some of these regions along the Danube, in order to repopulate the area and re-establish agriculture after the effects of the Ottoman invasion and disease. The Germans, who became known as Danube-Swabians, were allowed to keep their language and Catholic religion. For more than a century, they had fairly autonomous settlements.

The first capital of Serbian Vojvodina was in Karlovci; it was later moved to Zemun, Veliki Bečkerek, and Temišvar. At the same time the title of the Orthodox Metropolitan of Karlovci was raised to that of Patriarch.

When Serbian Vojvodina was in 1849 organized as the new province named Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar, the town of Karlovci was not included into this province. It was returned to the administration of the Military Frontier (a Petrovaradin regiment that was part of Slavonian Krajina). With the abolition in 1881 of the Military Frontier, the town was included in Syrmia County of Croatia-Slavonia, the autonomous kingdom within Kingdom of Hungary and Austria-Hungary.

An Orthodox Patriarchate of Karlovci operated after 1848 in Karlovci until 1920, after World War I. At that time, the position was joined with the Metropolitanate of Belgrade to form the united Serbian Orthodox Church, in what was then the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.

Between 1921 and 1944 the Patriarchate of Karlovci&#x27;s Palace was the seat of the administration of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia.

===Yugoslavia and Serbia (1918–onward)===
In 1918, the town became part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (also known as the Kingdom of Yugoslavia). In the summer of 1921, the town&#x27;s former palace of the Patriarch of Karlovci was used as the residence of Russian metropolitan Antony (Khrapovitsky). Together with some refugee bishops from Russia, he organised what a few years later was instituted as the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia (ROCOR). (Some critics called this ecclesiastical body the &quot;Karlovatsky Synod&quot; (), or ″Karlovatsky group″, also known in English as Synod of Karlovci.)

In 1922, the town became the headquarters of Russian White émigrés under the leadership of General Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel. In 1924 he set up the Russian All-Military Union, designed to include all Russian military émigrés the world over. Many emigres went to western Europe, especially France, and to the United States. A monument to Wrangel, sculpted by Vasiliy Azemsha, was unveiled in September 2007 in Karlovci.

Between 1929 and 1941, the town was part of Danube Banovina, a province of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. During World War II (1941–1944), after Nazi Germany&#x27;s invasion of eastern Europe, the town was occupied by forces of the Axis Powers. It was attached to the Independent State of Croatia. During that time its name was changed to &quot;Hrvatski Karlovci&quot;. After the end of the war, most ethnic Germans were expelled from eastern Europe. The town became part of the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina, Serbia.

Between 1980 and 1989, Sremski Karlovci was one of the seven municipalities of the city of Novi Sad.

In January 2021 PM Igor Mirović announced a reconstruction of the facades of historically important buildings in Sremski Karlovci.

==Demographics==
According to the 2011 census, the municipality of Sremski Karlovci has 8,750 inhabitants.

==Politics==
Until 1989 Sremski Karlovci formed one of the urban municipalities of the city of Novi Sad. After Novi Sad merged six of its municipalities into one &quot;Novi Sad municipality&quot;, the municipality of Sremski Karlovci held a referendum to separate from Novi Sad, and established a separate municipality independent from Novi Sad. Although Sremski Karlovci lies in Syrmia region, the municipality belongs in South Bačka District, and not in the Syrmia District, because of its close proximity to Novi Sad.

In the Serbian local elections held on 24 April 2016, Sremski Karlovci elected a new municipality parliament, ending the rule of the DS in the town. Nenad Milenković, of the Serbian progressive Party, was elected as the new mayor of the municipal parliament.

<doc id="55112" wikidata="Q441890" url="?curid=55112" title="Little Desert National Park">
<text>The Little Desert National Park is a national park in the Wimmera Mallee region of Victoria, Australia. The national park is situated near Dimboola, approximately west of Melbourne and extends from the Wimmera River in the east to the South Australian border in the west near .

While the region is surrounded by agricultural land, the area of the Little Desert itself &quot;consists mainly of deep sandy soils with very low fertility, interspersed with small pockets of clay soils. There are occasional rocky, sandstone outcrops and buckshot rises. Average yearly rainfall varies remarkably from the east to the west.&quot; The Little Desert &quot;remains relatively undisturbed by human activity, even though in the earlier years of European settlement it experienced some industry in the way of grazing and woodcutting.&quot; Now the desert is a National Park, and is &quot;broken up into three blocks&quot;: Western Block, Central Block and Eastern Block; demarcated by two north-south roads, the Nhill-Harrow road and the Kaniva-Edenhope road.

Today the National Park is an important tourist destination receiving about 50,000 visitors each year. Parks Victoria maintain multiple camping sites, walking tracks, look-outs and four-wheel-driving tracks throughout the park. Although most internal roads within the National Park are only accessible by four-wheel-drive vehicles and some are closed during winter or after wet weather.

==History==
===Pre-National Park===
Prior to the establishment of the park, small Aboriginal family groups camped along the Wimmera River. European activity began with grazing from the 1840s but had ceased by the 1960s. During the Second World War the Central Block was used as a bombing and gunnery range and the remains of several concrete observation bunkers are still present.

===National Park===
The low-nutrient sandy soil combined with low rainfalls made farming difficult. After the Second World War, the State Government considered clearing and selling land in the Little Desert region. Local opposition to selling the land for farming was intense and quickly gathered support around Victoria. The Bolte Government was initially unmoved by environmental concerns. Public outrage over the proposed subdivision resulted in the responsible minister&#x27;s losing his safe seat in a by-election. The Little Desert debate galvanised Victoria&#x27;s conservation movement into forming a peak body, the Conservation Council of Victoria, and the conservative Victorian government of Henry Bolte to adopt environmental policies, such as establishing the Land Conservation Council to systematically and independently review all future public land use across the state. The architect of the Land Conservation Council was the newly appointed Minister of Lands, Conservation and Soldier Settlement, William Borthwick, who supported retaining the area as a nature reserve. So in 1955 the Kiata Lowan Sanctuary was established to preserve the &#x27;Eastern block&#x27; of the Desert and protect the local Malleefowl. In 1969 this Sanctuary became &#x27;The Little Desert National Park&#x27; in the &#x27;Eastern Block&#x27; and in 1986 the &#x27;Central&#x27; and &#x27;Western&#x27; Blocks were added.

=== 2025 bushfire ===
On 27 January a fire was burning out of control in Little Desert National Park. Residents of nearby Dimboola were evacuated. More than were burnt in under 8 hours. On 31 January it was deemed contained after burning . Little Desert Nature Lodge, a &quot;popular wedding and conference centre&quot; near the parks&#x27; boundary, was destroyed.

==Flora and fauna==
The Little Desert receives an annual rainfall of approximately , though there is a gradient from in the east to near Naracoorte. The vegetation of the park ranges from pure mallee heathland in the Eastern Block to cypress pine and casuarina woodlands in the moister Western Block. In the Western Block, there are large areas of seasonal swampland formed over claypans. Laterites are scattered throughout the sandy areas of the park and characterised by broombush. Brush-tailed possums and Grey kangaroos are common throughout the park, and lizards can be observed basking in the sun.

===Birds===
With over 200 species of birds the national park has been identified by BirdLife International, an international NGO, as an Important Bird Area because it supports populations of malleefowl and diamond firetails.
The malleefowl is a rare bird found on the site and their protection was a contributory factor in the decision to preserve the area in 1968.

<text>Cabbage, comprising several cultivars of &quot;Brassica oleracea&quot;, is a leafy green, red (purple), or white (pale green) biennial plant grown as an annual vegetable crop for its dense-leaved heads. It is descended from the wild cabbage (&quot;B. oleracea&quot; var. &quot;oleracea&quot;), and belongs to the &quot;cole crops&quot; or brassicas, meaning it is closely related to broccoli and cauliflower (var. &quot;botrytis&quot;); Brussels sprouts (var. &quot;gemmifera&quot;); and Savoy cabbage (var. &quot;sabauda&quot;).

A cabbage generally weighs between . Smooth-leafed, firm-headed green cabbages are the most common, with smooth-leafed purple cabbages and crinkle-leafed savoy cabbages of both colours being rarer. Under conditions of long sunny days, such as those found at high northern latitudes in summer, cabbages can grow quite large. , the heaviest cabbage was . Cabbage heads are generally picked during the first year of the plant&#x27;s life cycle, but plants intended for seed are allowed to grow a second year and must be kept separate from other cole crops to prevent cross-pollination. Cabbage is prone to several nutrient deficiencies, as well as to multiple pests, and bacterial and fungal diseases.

Cabbage was most likely domesticated somewhere in Europe in ancient history before 1000 BC. Cabbage use in cuisine has been documented since Antiquity. It was described as a table luxury in the Roman Empire. By the Middle Ages, cabbage had become a prominent part of European cuisine, as indicated by manuscript illuminations. New variates were introduced from the Renaissance on, mostly by Germanic-speaking peoples. Savoy cabbage was developed in the 16th century. By the 17th and 18th centuries, cabbage was popularised as staple food in central, northern, and Eastern Europe. It was also employed by European sailors to prevent scurvy during long ship voyages at sea. Starting in the early modern era, cabbage was exported to the Americas, Asia, and around the world.

They can be prepared many different ways for eating; they can be pickled, fermented (for dishes such as sauerkraut, kimchi), steamed, stewed, roasted, sautéed, braised, or eaten raw. Raw cabbage is a rich source of vitamin K, vitamin C, and dietary fiber. World production of cabbage and other brassicas in 2020 was 71 million tonnes, led by China with 48% of the total.

== Description ==
Cabbage seedlings have a thin taproot and cordate (heart-shaped) cotyledons. The first leaves produced are ovate (egg-shaped) with a lobed petiole. Plants are tall in their first year at the mature vegetative stage, and tall when flowering in the second year. Heads average between , with fast-growing, earlier-maturing varieties producing smaller heads. Most cabbages have thick, alternating leaves, with margins that range from wavy or lobed to highly dissected; some varieties have a waxy bloom on the leaves. Plants have root systems that are fibrous and shallow. About 90% of the root mass is in the upper of soil; some lateral roots can penetrate up to deep.

The inflorescence is an unbranched and indeterminate terminal raceme measuring tall, with flowers that are yellow or white. Each flower has four petals set in a perpendicular pattern, as well as four sepals, six stamens, and a superior ovary that is two-celled and contains a single stigma and style. Two of the six stamens have shorter filaments. The fruit is a silique that opens at maturity through dehiscence to reveal brown or black seeds that are small and round in shape. Self-pollination is impossible, and plants are cross-pollinated by insects. The initial leaves form a rosette shape comprising 7 to 15 leaves, each measuring by ; after this, leaves with shorter petioles develop and heads form through the leaves cupping inward.

Many shapes, colors and leaf textures are found in various cultivated varieties of cabbage. Leaf types are generally divided between crinkled-leaf, loose-head savoys and smooth-leaf firm-head cabbages, while the color spectrum includes white and a range of greens and purples. Oblate, round and pointed shapes are found.

Cabbage has been selectively bred for head weight and morphological characteristics, frost hardiness, fast growth and storage ability. The appearance of the cabbage head has been given importance in selective breeding, with varieties being chosen for shape, color, firmness and other physical characteristics. Breeding objectives are now focused on increasing resistance to various insects and diseases and improving the nutritional content of cabbage. Scientific research into the genetic modification of &quot;B. oleracea&quot; crops, including cabbage, has included European Union and United States explorations of greater insect and herbicide resistance.

There are several &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; entries related to cabbage. These include the heaviest cabbage, at , heaviest red cabbage, at , longest cabbage roll, at , and the largest cabbage dish, at .

==Taxonomy==

Cabbage (&quot;Brassica oleracea&quot; or &quot;B. oleracea&quot; var. &quot;capitata&quot;, var. &quot;tuba&quot;, var. &quot;sabauda&quot; or var. &quot;acephala&quot;) is a member of the genus &quot;Brassica&quot; and the mustard family Brassicaceae. Several other cruciferous vegetables (sometimes known as &quot;cole crops&quot;) are cultivars of &quot;B. oleracea&quot;, including broccoli, collard greens, brussels sprouts, kohlrabi and sprouting broccoli. All of these developed from the wild cabbage &quot;B. oleracea&quot; var. &quot;oleracea&quot;, also called colewort or field cabbage. This original species evolved over thousands of years into those seen today, as selection resulted in cultivars having different characteristics, such as large heads for cabbage, large leaves for kale and thick stems with flower buds for broccoli.

&quot;Cabbage&quot; was originally used to refer to multiple forms of &quot;B. oleracea&quot;, including those with loose or non-existent heads. A related species, &quot;Brassica rapa&quot;, is commonly named Chinese, napa or celery cabbage, and has many of the same uses. It is also a part of common names for several unrelated species. These include cabbage bark or cabbage tree (a member of the genus &quot;Andira&quot;) and cabbage palms, which include several genera of palms such as &quot;Mauritia&quot;, &quot;Roystonea oleracea&quot;, &quot;Acrocomia&quot; and &quot;Euterpe oenocarpus&quot;.

=== Etymology ===
The original family name of brassicas was &quot;Cruciferae&quot;, which derived from the flower petal pattern thought by medieval Europeans to resemble a crucifix. The word &quot;brassica&quot; derives from &quot;bresic&quot;, a Celtic word for cabbage. The varietal epithet &quot;capitata&quot; is derived from the Latin word for &#x27;having a head&#x27;.

Many European and Asiatic names for cabbage are derived from the Celto-Slavic root &quot;cap&quot; or &quot;kap&quot;, meaning &quot;head&quot;. The late Middle English word &quot;cabbage&quot; derives from the word &quot;caboche&quot; (&quot;head&quot;), from the Picard dialect of Old French. This in turn is a variant of the Old French &quot;caboce&quot;.

== Cultivation ==

=== History ===
Although cabbage has an extensive history, it is difficult to trace its exact origins owing to the many varieties of leafy greens classified as &quot;brassicas&quot;. A possible wild ancestor of cabbage, &quot;Brassica oleracea&quot;, originally found in Britain and continental Europe, is tolerant of salt but not encroachment by other plants and consequently inhabits rocky cliffs in cool damp coastal habitats, retaining water and nutrients in its slightly thickened, turgid leaves. However, genetic analysis is consistent with feral origin of this population, deriving from plants escaped from field and gardens. According to the triangle of U theory of the evolution and relationships between &quot;Brassica&quot; species, &quot;B. oleracea&quot; and other closely related kale vegetables (cabbages, kale, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and cauliflower) represent one of three ancestral lines from which all other brassicas originated.

Cabbage was probably domesticated later in history than Near Eastern crops such as lentils and summer wheat. Because of the wide range of crops developed from the wild &quot;B. oleracea&quot;, multiple broadly contemporaneous domestications of cabbage may have occurred throughout Europe. Nonheading cabbages and kale were probably the first to be domesticated, before 1000 BC, perhaps by the Celts of central and western Europe, although recent linguistic and genetic evidence enforces a Mediterranean origin of cultivated brassicas.

While unidentified brassicas were part of the highly conservative unchanging Mesopotamian garden repertory, it is believed that the ancient Egyptians did not cultivate cabbage, which is not native to the Nile valley, though the word &quot;shaw&#x27;t&quot; in Papyrus Harris of the time of Ramesses III has been interpreted as &quot;cabbage&quot;. The ancient Greeks had some varieties of cabbage, as mentioned by Theophrastus, although whether they were more closely related to today&#x27;s cabbage or to one of the other &quot;Brassica&quot; crops is unknown. The headed cabbage variety was known to the Greeks as &quot;krambe&quot; and to the Romans as &quot;brassica&quot; or &quot;olus&quot;; the open, leafy variety (kale) was known in Greek as &quot;raphanos&quot; and in Latin as &quot;caulis&quot;. Ptolemaic Egyptians knew the cole crops as &quot;gramb&quot;, under the influence of Greek &quot;krambe&quot;, which had been a familiar plant to the Macedonian antecedents of the Ptolemies. By early Roman times, Egyptian artisans and children were eating cabbage and turnips among a wide variety of other vegetables and pulses.

Chrysippus of Cnidos wrote a treatise on cabbage, which Pliny knew, but it has not survived. The Greeks were convinced that cabbages and grapevines were inimical, and that cabbage planted too near the vine would impart its unwelcome odor to the grapes; this Mediterranean sense of antipathy survives today.

&quot;Brassica&quot; was considered by some Romans a table luxury, although Lucullus considered it unfit for the senatorial table. The more traditionalist Cato the Elder, espousing a simple Republican life, ate his cabbage cooked or raw and dressed with vinegar; he said it surpassed all other vegetables, and approvingly distinguished three varieties; he also gave directions for its medicinal use, which extended to the cabbage-eater&#x27;s urine, in which infants might be rinsed. Pliny the Elder listed seven varieties, including Pompeii cabbage, Cumae cabbage and Sabellian cabbage. 

According to Pliny, the Pompeii cabbage, which could not stand cold, is &quot;taller, and has a thick stock near the root, but grows thicker between the leaves, these being scantier and narrower, but their tenderness is a valuable quality&quot;. The Pompeii cabbage was also mentioned by Columella in &quot;De Re Rustica&quot;. Apicius gives several recipes for &quot;cauliculi&quot;, tender cabbage shoots. The Greeks and Romans claimed medicinal usages for their cabbage varieties that included relief from gout, headaches and the symptoms of poisonous mushroom ingestion. 

The antipathy towards the vine made it seem that eating cabbage would enable one to avoid drunkenness. Cabbage continued to figure in the &quot;materia medica&quot; of antiquity as well as at table: in the first century AD Dioscorides mentions two kinds of coleworts with medical uses, the cultivated and the wild, and his opinions continued to be paraphrased in herbals right through the 17th century.

At the end of Antiquity cabbage is mentioned in &quot;De observatione ciborum&quot; (&quot;On the Observance of Foods&quot;) by Anthimus, a Greek doctor at the court of Theodoric the Great. Cabbage appears among vegetables directed to be cultivated in the &quot;Capitulare de villis&quot;, composed in 771–800 AD, that guided the governance of the royal estates of Charlemagne.

In Britain, the Anglo-Saxons cultivated &quot;cawel&quot;. When round-headed cabbages appeared in 14th-century England they were called &quot;cabaches&quot; and &quot;caboches&quot;, words drawn from Old French and applied at first to refer to the ball of unopened leaves, the contemporaneous recipe that commences &quot;Take cabbages and quarter them, and seethe them in good broth&quot;, also suggests the tightly headed cabbage.
Manuscript illuminations show the prominence of cabbage in the cuisine of the High Middle Ages, and cabbage seeds feature among the seed list of purchases for the use of King John II of France when captive in England in 1360, but cabbages were also a familiar staple of the poor: in the lean year of 1420 the &quot;Bourgeois of Paris&quot; noted that &quot;poor people ate no bread, nothing but cabbages and turnips and such dishes, without any bread or salt&quot;. French naturalist Jean Ruel made what is considered the first explicit mention of head cabbage in his 1536 botanical treatise &quot;De Natura Stirpium&quot;, referring to it as &quot;capucos coles&quot; (&quot;head-coles&quot;).

In Istanbul, Sultan Selim III penned a tongue-in-cheek ode to cabbage: without cabbage, the halva feast was not complete. In India, cabbage was one of several vegetable crops introduced by colonizing traders from Portugal, who established trade routes from the 14th to 17th centuries. Carl Peter Thunberg reported that cabbage was not yet known in Japan in 1775.

Many cabbage varieties—including some still commonly grown—were introduced in Germany, France, and the Low Countries. During the 16th century, German gardeners developed the savoy cabbage. During the 17th and 18th centuries, cabbage was a food staple in such countries as Germany, England, Ireland and Russia, and pickled cabbage was frequently eaten. Sauerkraut was used by Dutch, Scandinavian and German sailors to prevent scurvy during long ship voyages.

Jacques Cartier first brought cabbage to the Americas in 1541–42, and it was probably planted by the early English colonists, despite the lack of written evidence of its existence there until the mid-17th century. By the 18th century, it was commonly planted by both colonists and native American Indians. Cabbage seeds traveled to Australia in 1788 with the First Fleet, and were planted the same year on Norfolk Island. It became a favorite vegetable of Australians by the 1830s and was frequently seen at the Sydney Markets. In Brno, Czech Republic there is an open-air market named after cabbage which has been in operation since 1325, the Zelný trh.

=== Modern cultivation ===

Cabbage is generally grown for its densely leaved heads, produced during the first year of its biennial cycle. Plants perform best when grown in well-drained soil in a location that receives full sun. Different varieties prefer different soil types, ranging from lighter sand to heavier clay, but all prefer fertile ground with a pH between 6.0 and 6.8. For optimal growth, there must be adequate levels of nitrogen in the soil, especially during the early head formation stage, and sufficient phosphorus and potassium during the early stages of expansion of the outer leaves. 

Temperatures between prompt the best growth, and extended periods of higher or lower temperatures may result in premature bolting (flowering). Flowering induced by periods of low temperatures (a process called vernalization) only occurs if the plant is past the juvenile period. The transition from a juvenile to adult state happens when the stem diameter is about . Vernalization allows the plant to grow to an adequate size before flowering. In certain climates, cabbage can be planted at the beginning of the cold period and survive until a later warm period without being induced to flower, a practice that was common in the eastern US.
Plants are generally started in protected locations early in the growing season before being transplanted outside, although some are seeded directly into the ground from which they will be harvested. Seedlings typically emerge in about 4–6 days from seeds planted deep at a soil temperature between . Growers normally place plants apart. Closer spacing reduces the resources available to each plant (especially the amount of light) and increases the time taken to reach maturity. 

Some varieties of cabbage have been developed for ornamental use; these are generally called &quot;flowering cabbage&quot;. They do not produce heads and feature purple or green outer leaves surrounding an inner grouping of smaller leaves in white, red, or pink. Early varieties of cabbage take about 70 days from planting to reach maturity, while late varieties take about 120 days. 

Cabbages are mature when they are firm and solid to the touch. They are harvested by cutting the stalk just below the bottom leaves with a blade. The outer leaves are trimmed, and any diseased, damaged, or necrotic leaves are removed. Delays in harvest can result in the head splitting as a result of expansion of the inner leaves and continued stem growth.

When being grown for seed, cabbages must be isolated from other &quot;B. oleracea&quot; subspecies, including the wild varieties, by to prevent cross-pollination. Other &quot;Brassica&quot; species, such as &quot;B. rapa&quot;, &quot;B. juncea&quot;, &quot;B. nigra&quot;, &quot;B. napus&quot; and &quot;Raphanus sativus&quot;, do not readily cross-pollinate.

===Cultivars===

There are several cultivar groups of cabbage, each including many cultivars:
* Savoy – Characterized by crimped or curly leaves, mild flavor and tender texture
* Spring greens (Brassica oleracea) – Loose-headed, commonly sliced and steamed
* Green – Light to dark green, slightly pointed heads.
* Red – Smooth red leaves, often used for pickling or stewing
* White, also called Dutch – Smooth, pale green leaves

Some sources only delineate three cultivars: savoy, red and white, with spring greens and green cabbage being subsumed under the last.

===Cultivation problems===
Due to its high level of nutrient requirements, cabbage is prone to nutrient deficiencies, including boron, calcium, phosphorus and potassium. There are several physiological disorders that can affect the postharvest appearance of cabbage. Internal tip burn occurs when the margins of inside leaves turn brown, but the outer leaves look normal. Necrotic spot is where there are oval sunken spots a few millimeters across that are often grouped around the midrib. In pepper spot, tiny black spots occur on the areas between the veins, which can increase during storage.

Fungal diseases include wirestem, which causes weak or dying transplants; &quot;Fusarium&quot; yellows, which result in stunted and twisted plants with yellow leaves; and blackleg (see &quot;Leptosphaeria maculans&quot;), which leads to sunken areas on stems and gray-brown spotted leaves. The fungi &quot;Alternaria brassicae&quot; and &quot;A. brassicicola&quot; cause dark leaf spots in affected plants. They are both seedborne and airborne, and typically propagate from spores in infected plant debris left on the soil surface for up to twelve weeks after harvest. &quot;Rhizoctonia solani&quot; causes the post-emergence disease wirestem, resulting in killed seedlings (&quot;damping-off&quot;), root rot or stunted growth and smaller heads.

One of the most common bacterial diseases to affect cabbage is black rot, caused by &quot;Xanthomonas campestris&quot;, which causes chlorotic and necrotic lesions that start at the leaf margins, and wilting of plants. Clubroot, caused by the soilborne slime mold-like organism &quot;Plasmodiophora brassicae&quot;, results in swollen, club-like roots. Downy mildew, a parasitic disease caused by the oomycete &quot;Peronospora parasitica&quot;, produces pale leaves with white, brownish or olive mildew on the lower leaf surfaces; this is often confused with the fungal disease powdery mildew.

Pests include root-knot nematodes and cabbage maggots, which produce stunted and wilted plants with yellow leaves; aphids, which induce stunted plants with curled and yellow leaves; harlequin cabbage bugs, which cause white and yellow leaves; thrips, which lead to leaves with white-bronze spots; striped flea beetles, which riddle leaves with small holes; and caterpillars, which leave behind large, ragged holes in leaves. The caterpillar stage of the &quot;small cabbage white butterfly&quot; (&quot;Pieris rapae&quot;), commonly known in the United States as the &quot;imported cabbage worm&quot;, is a major cabbage pest in most countries.

The large white butterfly (&quot;Pieris brassicae&quot;) is prevalent in eastern European countries. The diamondback moth (&quot;Plutella xylostella&quot;) and the cabbage moth (&quot;Mamestra brassicae&quot;) thrive in the higher summer temperatures of continental Europe, where they cause considerable damage to cabbage crops. The mustard leaf beetle (&quot;Phaedon cochleariae&quot;), is a common pest of cabbage plants. The mustard leaf beetle will often choose to feed on cabbage over their natural host plants as cabbage is more abundant in palatable compounds such as glucosinolates that encourage higher consumption. The cabbage looper (&quot;Trichoplusia ni&quot;) is infamous in North America for its voracious appetite and for producing frass that contaminates plants. In India, the diamondback moth has caused losses up to 90 percent in crops that were not treated with insecticide. Destructive soil insects such as the cabbage root fly (&quot;Delia radicum&quot;) has larvae can burrow into the part of plant consumed by humans.

Planting near other members of the cabbage family, or where these plants have been placed in previous years, can prompt the spread of pests and disease. Excessive water and excessive heat can also cause cultivation problems.

Factors that contribute to reduced head weight include: growth in the compacted soils that result from no-till farming practices, drought, waterlogging, insect and disease incidence, and shading and nutrient stress caused by weeds.

=== Production ===
In 2020, world production of cabbages (combined with other brassicas) was 71 million tonnes, led by China with 48% of the world total (table). Other substantial producers were India, Russia, and South Korea.

==Toxicity==
When overcooked, toxic hydrogen sulfide gas is produced.

Excessive consumption of cabbage may lead to increased intestinal gas which causes bloating and flatulence due to the trisaccharide raffinose, which the human small intestine cannot digest, but is digested by bacteria in the large intestine.

Cabbage has been linked to outbreaks of some food-borne illnesses, including &quot;Listeria monocytogenes&quot; and &quot;Clostridium botulinum&quot;. The latter toxin has been traced to pre-made, packaged coleslaw mixes, while the spores were found on whole cabbages that were otherwise acceptable in appearance. &quot;Shigella&quot; species are able to survive in shredded cabbage. Two outbreaks of &quot;E. coli&quot; in the United States have been linked to cabbage consumption. Biological risk assessments have concluded that there is the potential for further outbreaks linked to uncooked cabbage, due to contamination at many stages of the growing, harvesting and packaging processes. Contaminants from water, humans, animals and soil have the potential to be transferred to cabbage, and from there to the end consumer.

Whilst not a toxic vegetable in its natural state, an increase in intestinal gas can lead to the death of many small animals like rabbits due to gastrointestinal stasis.

Cabbage and other cruciferous vegetables contain small amounts of thiocyanate, a compound associated with goiter formation when iodine intake is deficient.

==Uses==
===Culinary===

The characteristic flavor of cabbage is caused by glucosinolates, a class of sulfur-containing glucosides. Although found throughout the plant, these compounds are concentrated in the highest quantities in the seeds; lesser quantities are found in young vegetative tissue, and they decrease as the tissue ages. Cooked cabbage is often criticized for its pungent, unpleasant odor and taste. These develop when cabbage is overcooked and hydrogen sulfide gas is produced.

Cabbage consumption varies widely around the world: Russia has the highest annual per capita consumption at , followed by Belgium at and the Netherlands at . Americans consume annually per capita.

=== Nutrition ===
Raw cabbage is 92% water, 6% carbohydrates, 1% protein, and contains negligible fat. In a 100-gram reference amount, raw cabbage is a rich source of vitamin C and vitamin K, containing 44% and 72%, respectively, of the Daily Value (DV). Cabbage is also a moderate source (10–19% DV) of vitamin B6 and folate, with no other nutrients having significant content per 100-gram serving.

=== Local market and storage ===
Cabbages sold for market are generally smaller, and different varieties are used for those sold immediately upon harvest and those stored before sale. Those used for processing, especially sauerkraut, are larger and have a lower percentage of water. Both hand and mechanical harvesting are used, and hand-harvesting is generally used for cabbages destined for market sales. In commercial-scale operations, hand-harvested cabbages are trimmed, sorted, and packed directly in the field to increase efficiency.

Vacuum cooling rapidly refrigerates the vegetable, allowing for earlier shipping and a fresher product. Cabbage can be stored the longest at with a humidity of 90–100%; these conditions will result in up to six months of longevity. When stored under less ideal conditions, cabbage can still last up to four months.

===Food preparation===
Cabbage is prepared and consumed in many ways. The simplest options include eating the vegetable raw or steaming it, though many cuisines pickle, stew, sautée or braise cabbage. Pickling is a common way of preserving cabbage, creating dishes such as sauerkraut and kimchi, although kimchi is more often made from Napa cabbage. Savoy cabbages are usually used in salads, while smooth-leaf types are utilized for both market sales and processing. Tofu and cabbage is a staple of Chinese cooking, while the British dish bubble and squeak is made primarily with leftover potato and boiled cabbage and eaten with cold meat. 

In Poland, cabbage is one of the main food crops, and it features prominently in Polish cuisine. It is frequently eaten, either cooked or as sauerkraut, as a side dish or as an ingredient in such dishes as bigos (cabbage, sauerkraut, meat, and wild mushrooms, among other ingredients) gołąbki (stuffed cabbage) and pierogi (filled dumplings). Other eastern European countries, such as Hungary and Romania, also have traditional dishes that feature cabbage as a main ingredient. In India and Ethiopia, cabbage is often included in spicy salads and braises. In the United States, cabbage is used primarily for the production of coleslaw, followed by market use and sauerkraut production.

=== Phytochemicals ===
Basic research on cabbage phytochemicals is ongoing to discern if certain cabbage compounds may affect health or have potential for anti-disease effects, such as sulforaphane and other glucosinolates. Studies on cruciferous vegetables, including cabbage, include whether they may lower the risk against colon cancer. Cabbage is a source of indole-3-carbinol, a chemical under basic research for its possible properties.

===Herbalism===

In addition to its usual purpose as an edible vegetable, cabbage has been used historically in herbalism. The Ancient Greeks recommended consuming the vegetable as a laxative, and used cabbage juice as an antidote for mushroom poisoning, for eye salves, and for liniments for bruises. The ancient Roman, Pliny the Elder, described both culinary and medicinal properties of the vegetable. Ancient Egyptians ate cooked cabbage at the beginning of meals to reduce the intoxicating effects of wine. This traditional usage persisted in European literature until the mid-20th century.

The supposed cooling properties of the leaves were used in Britain as a treatment for trench foot in World War I, and as compresses for ulcers and breast abscesses. Other medicinal uses recorded in European folk medicine include treatments for rheumatism, sore throat, hoarseness, colic, and melancholy. Both mashed cabbage and cabbage juice have been used in poultices to remove boils and treat warts, pneumonia, appendicitis, and ulcers.

<doc id="55116" wikidata="Q1722" url="?curid=55116" title="Dubrovnik">
<text>Dubrovnik (, , ; see notes on naming), historically known as Ragusa (), is a city in southern Dalmatia, Croatia, by the Adriatic Sea. It is one of the most prominent tourist destinations in the Mediterranean, a seaport and the centre of the Dubrovnik-Neretva County. Its total population is 41,562 (2021 census). In 1979, the city of Dubrovnik was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites in recognition of its outstanding medieval architecture and fortified old town.

The history of the city probably dates back to the 7th century, when the town known as was founded by refugees from Epidaurum (). It was under protectorate of the Byzantine Empire and later under the sovereignty of the Republic of Venice. Between the 14th and 19th centuries, Dubrovnik ruled itself as a free state. The prosperity of the city was historically based on maritime trade; as the capital of the maritime Republic of Ragusa, it achieved a high level of development, particularly during the 15th and 16th centuries, as it became notable for its wealth and skilled diplomacy. At the same time, Dubrovnik became a cradle of Croatian literature. In his letter to Nikola Nalješković (1564), poet Ivan Vidalić named it &quot;crown of Croatian cities&quot;.

The entire city was almost destroyed in a devastating earthquake in 1667. During the Napoleonic Wars, Dubrovnik was occupied by the French Empire forces, and then the Republic of Ragusa was abolished and incorporated into the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy and later into the Illyrian Provinces of France. In the early 19th to early 20th century, Dubrovnik was part of the Kingdom of Dalmatia within the Austrian Empire. Dubrovnik became part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia immediately upon its creation, and it was incorporated into its Zeta Banovina in 1929, before becoming part of the Banovina of Croatia upon its creation in 1939. During World War II, it was part of the Axis puppet state Independent State of Croatia, before being reincorporated into Socialist Republic of Croatia in Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

In 1991, during the Croatian War of Independence, Dubrovnik was besieged by the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army for seven months and suffered significant damage from shelling. After undergoing repair and restoration works in the 1990s and early 2000s, it re-emerged as one of the Mediterranean&#x27;s top tourist destinations, as well as a popular filming location. According to Holidu, Dubrovnik was the most &#x27;over-touristed&#x27; destination in Europe during 2023, with 27.42 tourists for each inhabitant. Often called &quot;The Queen of Adriatic&quot; Dubrovnik is considered one of the most popular destinations in the Adriatic and in Europe.

==Names==
The names &quot;Dubrovnik&quot; and &quot;Ragusa&quot; co-existed for several centuries. &quot;Ragusa&quot;, recorded in various forms since at least the 10th century (in Latin, Dalmatian, Italian; in ), remained the official name of the Republic of Ragusa until 1808, and of the city within the Kingdom of Dalmatia until 1918, while &quot;Dubrovnik&quot;, first recorded in the late 12th century, was in widespread use by the late 16th or early 17th century.

The name &quot;Dubrovnik&quot; of the Adriatic city is first recorded in the Charter of Ban Kulin (1189). The most common explanation for the origin is from a Proto-Slavic word meaning &#x27;oak&#x27;, and the term referring to &#x27;oak wood&#x27; or &#x27;oak forest&#x27;, as means &#x27;oakwood&#x27;, &#x27;forest&#x27;.

The historical name &quot;Ragusa&quot; is recorded in the Greek form (, Latinized ) in the 10th century. It was recorded in various forms in the medieval period, &quot;Rausia&quot;, &quot;Lavusa&quot;, &quot;Labusa&quot;, &quot;Raugia&quot;, &quot;Rachusa&quot;. Various attempts have been made to etymologize the name. Suggestions include derivation from Greek , &quot;grape&quot;; from Greek , &quot;narrow passage&quot;; Greek &quot;ragged (of rocks)&quot;, () &quot;fissure&quot;; from the name of the Epirote tribe of the &quot;Rhogoi&quot;, from an unidentified Illyrian substrate. A connection to the name of Sicilian Ragusa has also been proposed. It has been proposed by V. Orel that the Proto-Albanian *&quot;rāguša&quot; of Albanian &quot;&quot; &#x27;grape&#x27; is related to &quot;Ragusa&quot; or the source of the name. Putanec (1993) gives a review of etymological suggestion, and favours an explanation of the name as pre-Greek (&quot;Pelasgian&quot;), from a root cognate to Greek &quot;fissure&quot;, with a suffix &quot;-ussa&quot; also found in the Greek name of Brač, &quot;Elaphousa&quot;. The name of the city in the native Dalmatian language, now extinct, was , as shown by a 1325 letter in Dalmatian. In Albanian, the city was historically referred to as &quot;&quot; (), from Latin &quot;Ragusium.&quot;

The classical explanation of the name is due to Constantine VII&#x27;s &quot;De Administrando Imperio&quot; (10th century). According to this account, Ragusa () is the foundation of the refugees from Epidaurum (Ragusa Vecchia), a Greek city situated some to the south of Ragusa, when that city was destroyed in the Slavic incursions of the 7th century. The name is explained as a corruption of a Dalmatae/Romance word &quot;Lausa&quot;, the name of the rocky island on which the city was built (connected by Constantine to Greek &quot;rock, stone&quot;).

==History==

=== Origins ===


Dubrovnik was inhabited by the Illyrian tribe of Pleraei in ancient times. According to Constantine Porphyrogenitus&#x27;s &quot;De Administrando Imperio&quot; ( 950), Ragusa was founded in the 7th century, named after a &quot;rocky island&quot; called &quot;Lausa&quot;, by refugees from Epidaurum (Ragusa Vecchia), a Roman city situated some to the south, when that city was destroyed by Slavs fighting with the Avars. It was one of the Dalmatian city-states.

Excavations in 2007 revealed a Byzantine basilica from the 8th century and parts of the city walls.
The size of the old basilica clearly indicates that there was quite a large settlement at the time.
There is also evidence for the presence of a settlement in the pre-Christian era, most notably the finding of ancient coins from the 3rd and 2nd century BC, as well as archeological fragments from the 1st century BC in the area of the old City port.

Antun Ničetić, in his 1996 book &quot;&quot; (), expounds the theory that Dubrovnik was established by Greek sailors, as a station halfway between the two Greek settlements of Budva and Korčula, apart from each of them.

===Republic of Ragusa===


After the fall of the Ostrogothic Kingdom, the town came under the protection of the Byzantine Empire. In the 12th and 13th centuries, Dubrovnik grew into an oligarchic republic. After the Crusades, Dubrovnik came under the sovereignty of Venice (1205–1358), which would give its institutions to the Dalmatian city. In 1240 Ragusa purchased the island of Lastovo from Stefan Uroš I, king of Serbia, who had rights over the island as ruler of parts of Zachlumia. After a fire destroyed most of the city on the night of August 16, 1296, a new urban plan was developed. By the Peace Treaty of Zadar in 1358, Dubrovnik achieved relative independence as a vassal-state of the Kingdom of Hungary. 

Between the 14th century and 1808, Dubrovnik ruled itself as a free state, although it was a tributary from 1382 to 1804 of the Ottoman Empire and paid an annual tribute to its sultan. The Republic reached its peak in the 15th and 16th centuries, when its thalassocracy rivalled that of the Republic of Venice and other Italian maritime republics.

There are also signs of a long established Albanian population in the Ragusan hinterlands since at least the Medieval period. And a Ragusan document dating to 1285 states: &quot;I heard a voice crying in the mountains in Albanian&quot; (Audivi unam vocem clamantem in monte in lingua albanesca).

For centuries, Dubrovnik was an ally of Ancona, the other Adriatic maritime republic rival of Venice, which was itself the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s chief rival for control of the Adriatic. This alliance enabled the two towns set on opposite sides of the Adriatic to resist attempts by the Venetians to make the Adriatic a &quot;Venetian Bay&quot;, also controlling directly or indirectly all the Adriatic ports. Ancona and Dubrovnik developed an alternative trade route to the Venetian (Venice–Austria–Germany): starting in Dubrovnik it went on to Ancona, through Florence and ended in Flanders. 
Ragusa was an important base for the traffic of the Balkan slave trade, from which slaves were transported from the Balkans across the Adriatic Sea to the Aegean Sea, from which they were sold on to either slavery in Spain in the West or slavery in Egypt in the South.

The Republic of Ragusa received its own Statutes as early as 1272, which, among other things, codified Roman practice and local customs. The Statutes included prescriptions for town planning and the regulation of quarantine (for sanitary reasons).

The Republic was an early adopter of what are now regarded as modern laws and institutions: a medical service was introduced in 1301, with the first pharmacy, still operating to this day, being opened in 1317. An almshouse was opened in 1347, and the first quarantine hospital (Lazarete) was established in 1377. Slave trading (Balkan slave trade) was abolished in 1418, and an orphanage opened in 1432. A water supply system, instead of a cistern, was constructed in 1438 by the Neapolitan architect and engineer Onofrio della Cava. He completed the aqueduct with two public fountains. He also built a number of mills along one of its branches.

The city was ruled by the local aristocracy which was of Latin-Dalmatian extraction and formed two city councils. As usual for the time, they maintained a strict system of social classes. The republic abolished the slave trade early in the 15th century and valued liberty highly. The city successfully balanced its sovereignty between the interests of Venice and the Ottoman Empire for centuries.

Latin was originally used in official documents of the Republic. Italian came to use in the early 15th century. A variant of the Dalmatian language was among the spoken ones, and was influenced by Croatian and Italian. The presence of Croatian in everyday speech increased in the late 13th century, and in literary works in the mid-15th century. In the coming decades, Dubrovnik became a cradle of Croatian literature.

The economic wealth of the Republic was partially the result of the land it developed, but especially of seafaring trade. With the help of skilled diplomacy, Dubrovnik merchants travelled lands freely and the city had a huge fleet of merchant ships (known as ) that travelled all over the world. From these travels they founded some settlements, from India (cf. Ragusan trade with India) to America, and brought parts of their culture and flora home with them. One of its keys to success was not conquering, but trading and sailing under a white flag with the word (freedom) prominently featured on it. The flag was adopted when slave trading was abolished in 1418.

In search of Indian spices and textiles, merchants from Dubrovnik arrived in Goa, India, and settled in what is now called Gandauli. The people of Dubrovnik arrived in the Portuguese colony of Goa between 1530 and 1535, and after that they founded their own colony, Sao Braz, named after the patron saint of Dubrovnik, St. Blaise. The church was built around 1563 and was a replica of the original church of St. Blaise in Dubrovnik. About 12,000 inhabitants lived in São Braz and was a thriving colony until the 1570s when trade between Croats and Indians declined. 

Many Conversos, Jews from Spain and Portugal who converted to Christianity, were attracted to the city. In May 1544, a ship landed there filled exclusively with Portuguese refugees, as Balthasar de Faria reported to King John. During this time one of the most famous cannon and bell founders of his time worked in the city: Ivan Rabljanin (also known as Magister Johannes Baptista Arbensis de la Tolle). By 1571 Dubrovnik had sold its protection over some Christian settlements in other parts of the Ottoman Empire to France and Venice. At that time there was also a colony of Dubrovnik in Fes in Morocco. The bishop of Dubrovnik was a Cardinal protector in 1571, at that time there were only 16 other countries which had Cardinal protectors.

Dubrovnik was a tributary state of the Ottoman Empire at one time. From this, they gained benefits such as access to the Black Sea, paid less customs duties (they however needed to make tribute payments) and had the diplomatic support of the Turks in trade disputes against the Venetians. This status also allowed increased trade with the inland regions through the Balkan overland trade which made merchants from Dubrovnik to build up a strong network unequaled with other Christian states.

The Republic gradually declined due to a combination of a Mediterranean shipping crisis and the catastrophic earthquake of 1667 that killed over 5,000 citizens, levelled most of the public buildings and, consequently, negatively affected the well-being of the Republic. In 1699, the Republic was forced to sell two mainland patches of its territory to the Ottomans in order to avoid being caught in the clash with advancing Venetian forces. Today this strip of land belongs to Bosnia and Herzegovina and is that country&#x27;s only direct access to the Adriatic. A highlight of Dubrovnik&#x27;s diplomacy was the involvement in the American Revolution.

=== Early modern period ===

On 27 May 1806, the forces of the Empire of France occupied the neutral Republic of Ragusa. Upon entering Ragusan territory without permission and approaching the capital, the French General Jacques Lauriston demanded that his troops be allowed to rest and be provided with food and drink in the city before continuing on to take possession of their holdings in the Bay of Kotor. However, this was a deception because as soon as they entered the city, they proceeded to occupy it in the name of Napoleon. Almost immediately after the beginning of the French occupation, Russian and Montenegrin troops entered Ragusan territory and began fighting the French army, raiding and pillaging everything along the way and culminating in a siege of the occupied city during which 3,000 cannonballs fell on it. In 1808 Marshal Marmont issued a proclamation abolishing the Republic of Ragusa and amalgamating its territory into the French Empire&#x27;s client state, the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy. Marmont claimed the newly created title of &quot;Duke of Ragusa&quot; () and in 1810 Ragusa, together with Istria and Dalmatia, went to the newly created French Illyrian Provinces.
After seven years of French occupation, encouraged by the desertion of French soldiers after the failed invasion of Russia and the reentry of Austria in the war, all the social classes of the Ragusan people rose up in a general insurrection, led by the patricians, against the Napoleonic invaders. On 18 June 1813, together with British forces they forced the surrender of the French garrison of the island of Šipan, soon also the heavily fortified town of Ston and the island of Lopud, after which the insurrection spread throughout the mainland, starting with Konavle. They then laid siege to the occupied city, helped by the British Royal Navy, who had enjoyed unopposed domination over the Adriatic sea, under the command of Captain William Hoste, with his ships HMS &quot;Bacchante&quot; and . Soon the population inside the city joined the insurrection. The Austrian Empire sent a force under General Todor Milutinović offering to help their Ragusan allies. However, as was soon shown, their intention was to in fact replace the French occupation of Ragusa with their own. Seducing one of the temporary governors of the Republic, Biagio Bernardo Caboga, with promises of power and influence (which were later cut short and who died in ignominy, branded as a traitor by his people), they managed to convince him that the gate to the east was to be kept closed to the Ragusan forces and to let the Austrian forces enter the City from the west, without any Ragusan soldiers, once the French garrison of 500 troops under General Joseph de Montrichard had surrendered.

After this, the Flag of Saint Blaise was flown alongside the Austrian and British colors, but only for two days because, on 30 January, General Milutinović ordered Mayor Sabo Giorgi to lower it. Overwhelmed by a feeling of deep patriotic pride, Giorgi, the last Rector of the Republic, refused to do so &quot;for the masses had hoisted it&quot;. Subsequent events proved that Austria took every possible opportunity to invade the entire coast of the eastern Adriatic, from Venice to Kotor. The Austrians did everything in their power to eliminate the Ragusa issue at the Congress of Vienna. Ragusan representative Miho Bona, elected at the last meeting of the Major Council, was denied participation in the Congress, while Milutinović, prior to the final agreement of the allies, assumed complete control of the city.

Regardless of the fact that the government of the Ragusan Republic never signed any capitulation nor relinquished its sovereignty, which according to the rules of Klemens von Metternich that Austria adopted for the Vienna Congress should have meant that the Republic would be restored, the Austrian Empire managed to convince the other allies to allow it to keep the territory of the Republic. While many smaller and less significant cities and former countries were permitted an audience, that right was refused to the representative of the Ragusan Republic. All of this was in blatant contradiction to the solemn treaties that the Austrian Emperors signed with the Republic: the first on 20 August 1684, in which Leopold I promises and guarantees inviolate liberty (&quot;inviolatam libertatem&quot;) to the Republic, and the second in 1772, in which the Empress Maria Theresa promises protection and respect of the inviolability of the freedom and territory of the Republic.

===Languages===

The official language until 1472 was Latin. As a consequence of the increasing migration of Slavic population from inland Dalmatia, the language spoken by much of the population was Croatian, typically referred to in Dubrovnik&#x27;s historical documents simply as &quot;Slavic&quot;. To oppose the demographic change due to increased Slavic immigration from the Balkans, the native Romance population of Ragusa, which made up the oligarchic government of the Republic, tried to prohibit the use of any Slavic languages in official councils. Archeologists have also discovered medieval Glagolitic tablets near Dubrovnik, such as the inscription of Župa Dubrovačka, indicating that the Glagolitic script was also likely once used in the city.

The Italian language as spoken in the republic was heavily influenced by the Venetian language and the Tuscan dialect. Italian took root among the Dalmatian-speaking merchant upper classes, as a result of Venetian influence which strengthened the original Latin element of the population.

On 14 July 1284 in Ragusa, the Albanian language was attested for the first time in history when a crime witness testified: &quot;I heard a voice crying on the mountain in the Albanian language&quot; (Latin: &quot;Audivi unam vocem, clamantem in monte in lingua albanesca&quot;).

===Austrian rule===


When the Habsburg Empire annexed these provinces after the 1815 Congress of Vienna, the new authorities implemented a bureaucratic administration, established the Kingdom of Dalmatia, which had its own Sabor (Diet) or Parliament which is the oldest Croatian political institution based in the city of Zadar, and political parties such as the Autonomist Party and the People&#x27;s Party. They introduced a series of modifications intended to slowly centralise the bureaucratic, tax, religious, educational, and trade structure. These steps largely failed, despite the intention of wanting to stimulate the economy. Once the personal, political and economic damage of the Napoleonic Wars had been overcome, new movements began to form in the region, calling for a political reorganisation of the Adriatic along national lines.

The combination of these two forces—a flawed Habsburg administrative system and new national movement claiming ethnicity as the founding block toward a community—posed a particularly perplexing problem: Dalmatia was a province ruled by the German-speaking Habsburg monarchy, with bilingual (Croatian- and Italian-speaking) elites that dominated the general population consisting of a Slavic Catholic majority, as well as a Slavic Orthodox minority. 

In 1815, the former Dubrovnik government (its noble assembly) met for the last time in Ljetnikovac in Mokošica. Once again, extreme measures were taken to re-establish the Republic, but it was all in vain. After the fall of the Republic most of the aristocracy was recognised by the Austrian Empire.

In 1832, Baron Šišmundo Getaldić-Gundulić (&quot;Sigismondo Ghetaldi-Gondola&quot;) (1795–1860) was elected Mayor of Dubrovnik, serving for 13 years; the Austrian government granted him the title of &quot;Baron&quot;.

Count Rafael Pucić (&quot;Raffaele Pozza&quot;) (1828–1890) was elected for first time Podestà of Dubrovnik in the year 1869 after this was re-elected in 1872, 1875, 1882, 1884) and elected twice into the Dalmatian Council, 1870, 1876. The victory of the Nationalists in Split in 1882 strongly affected in the areas of Korčula and Dubrovnik. It was greeted by the mayor (podestà) of Dubrovnik Rafael Pucić, the National Reading Club of Dubrovnik, the Workers Association of Dubrovnik and the review &quot;Slovinac&quot; as well as by the communities of Kuna and Orebić, the latter one getting the nationalist government even before Split.

In 1901, the narrow-gauge (760 mm) railway line was opened primarily to connect the port city of Dubrovnik with the interior of Bosnia and Herzegovina and further into Europe. The line was operational from 1901 to 1976.

In 1905, the Committee for establishing electric tram service, headed by Luko Bunić was established. Other members of the Committee were Ivo Papi, Miho Papi, Artur Saraka, Mato Šarić, Antun Pugliesi, Mato Gracić, Ivo Degiulli, Ernest Katić and Antun Milić. The tram service in Dubrovnik existed from 1910 to 1970.

Pero Čingrija (1837–1921), one of the leaders of the People&#x27;s Party in Dalmatia, played the main role in the merger of the People&#x27;s Party and the Party of Right into a single Croatian Party in 1905.

===Yugoslav period (1918–1991)===


With the fall of Austria-Hungary in 1918, the city was incorporated into the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes (later renamed to Kingdom of Yugoslavia). Dubrovnik became one of the 33 oblasts of the Kingdom. When Yugoslavia was divided among nine banovinas in 1929, the city became part of the Zeta Banovina. In 1939, Dubrovnik became part of the newly created Banovina of Croatia.

During the World War II in Yugoslavia, Dubrovnik became part of the Axis puppet state, Independent State of Croatia (NDH), occupied by the Italian Army first, and by the German Army after 8 September 1943. There were clashes between Italian and German troops in Dubrovnik when the Germans took over. In October 1944, Yugoslav Partisans liberated Dubrovnik, arresting more than 300 citizens and executing 53 without trial; this event came to be known, after the small island on which it occurred, as the Daksa executions. Communist leadership during the next several years continued political prosecutions, which culminated on 12 April 1947 with the capture and imprisonment of more than 90 citizens of Dubrovnik. After the war the remaining members of Dalmatian Italians of Dubrovnik left Yugoslavia towards Italy (Istrian-Dalmatian exodus).

Under communism Dubrovnik became part of SR Croatia within SFR Yugoslavia. After the World War II, the city started to attract crowds of tourists–even more after 1979, when the city joined the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites. The growth of tourism also led to the decision to demilitarise the Dubrovnik Old Town. The income from tourism was pivotal in the post-war development of the city, including its airport. The Dubrovnik Summer Festival was founded in 1950. The Adriatic Highway (&quot;Magistrala&quot;) was opened in 1965 after a decade of works, connecting Dubrovnik with Rijeka along the whole coastline, and giving a boost to the tourist development of the Croatian Riviera.

===Siege of Dubrovnik and its consequences===
In 1991, Croatia and Slovenia, which at that time were republics within SFR Yugoslavia, declared their independence. The Socialist Republic of Croatia was renamed as the Republic of Croatia.

Despite the demilitarisation of the Old Town in early 1970s in an attempt to prevent it from ever becoming a casualty of war, following Croatia&#x27;s independence in 1991, Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army (JNA)–by then composed primarily of Serbs–attacked the city. The new Croatian government set up a military outpost in the city itself. Montenegro–led by President Momir Bulatović and Prime Minister Milo Đukanović, who came to power in the Anti-bureaucratic revolution and were allied to Slobodan Milošević in Serbia–declared that Dubrovnik should not remain in Croatia. At the time most residents of Dubrovnik had come to identify as Croatian, with Serbs accounting for 6.8 percent of the population.

On 1 October 1991, Dubrovnik was attacked by the JNA resulting in a siege that lasted for seven months. The heaviest artillery attack was on 6 December with 19 people killed and 60 wounded. The number of casualties in the conflict, according to the Croatian Red Cross, was 114 killed civilians, among them poet Milan Milišić. Foreign newspapers were criticised for placing heavier attention on the damage suffered by the Old Town than on human casualties. Nonetheless, the artillery attacks on Dubrovnik damaged 56% of its buildings to some degree, as the historic walled city, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, sustained 650 hits by artillery rounds. The Croatian Army lifted the siege in May 1992, and liberated Dubrovnik&#x27;s surroundings by the end of October, but the danger of sudden attacks by the JNA lasted for another three years.

Following the end of the war, damage caused by the shelling of the Old Town was repaired. Adhering to UNESCO guidelines, repairs were performed in the original style. Most of the reconstruction work was done between 1995 and 1999. The inflicted damage can be seen on a chart near the city gate, showing all artillery hits during the siege, and is clearly visible from high points around the city in the form of the more brightly coloured new roofs.

The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) issued indictments for JNA generals and officers involved in the bombing. General Pavle Strugar, who coordinated the attack on the city, was sentenced to a seven-and-a-half-year prison term by the tribunal for his role in the attack.

===Post-war Dubrovnik in Republic of Croatia===

The 1996 Croatia USAF CT-43 crash, near Dubrovnik Airport, killed everyone on a United States Air Force jet, including United States Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown, &quot;The New York Times&quot; Frankfurt Bureau chief Nathaniel C. Nash, and 33 other people.

In October 2023, Dubrovnik joined European Network of Saint James Way Paths, with a 147-kilometer pilgrimage route &quot;Camino Dubrovnik-Međugorje&quot;, expected to be open to visitors in May 2024.

== Geography ==
Dubrovnik is located in the southern tip of the Dalmatia region of Croatia in the Adriatic Sea. It is part of the Dubrovnik-Neretva County and borders the municipality of Dubrovačko Primorje to the north, more specifically the Majkovi village.

=== Islands ===


There are several islands (part of the Elaphiti Islands archipelago) off the coast of Dubrovnik, including from north to south (the islands in bold are larger and populated, and most of these are uninhabited):
* Olipa
* Tajan
* Mišnjak
* Jakljan
* Šipan
* Crkvina
* Kosmeč
* Ruda
* Lopud
* Koločep
* Daksa
* Grebeni
* Sveti Andrija
Another island disputedly part of the Elaphiti Islands is:
* Lokrum

=== Climate ===
Dubrovnik has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csa&quot;). Dubrovnik has hot, muggy, relatively dry summers and mild to cool wet winters. The bora wind blows cold gusts down the Adriatic coast between October and April, and thundery conditions are common year round, even in summer, when they interrupt the warm, sunny days. The air temperatures can slightly vary, depending on the area or region. Typically, in July and August daytime maximum temperatures reach , and at night drop to approximately . In spring and autumn, maximum temperatures are typically between and . Dubrovnik has the mildest winters of any Croatian city, with daytime temperatures around in the coldest months. Snow in Dubrovnik is very rare.

==Heritage==

The annual Dubrovnik Summer Festival is a 45-day-long cultural event with live plays, concerts and games. It has been awarded a Gold International Trophy for Quality (2007) by the Editorial Office in collaboration with the Trade Leaders Club.

The patron saint of the city is Sveti Vlaho (Saint Blaise), whose statues are seen around the city. He has an importance similar to that of St. Mark the Evangelist to Venice. One of the larger churches in the city is named after Saint Blaise.
February 3 is the feast of Sveti Vlaho. Every year the city of Dubrovnik celebrates the holiday with Mass, parades, and festivities that last for several days.

The Old Town of Dubrovnik is depicted on the reverse of the Croatian 50 kuna banknote, issued in 1993 and 2002.

The city boasts many old buildings, such as the Arboretum Trsteno, the oldest arboretum in the world, which dates back to before 1492. Also, the third-oldest European pharmacy and the oldest still in operation, having been founded in 1317, is in Dubrovnik, at the Little Brothers monastery.

In history, many Conversos (Marranos) were attracted to Dubrovnik, formerly a considerable seaport. In May 1544, a ship landed there filled exclusively with Portuguese refugees, as Balthasar de Faria reported to King John. Another admirer of Dubrovnik, George Bernard Shaw, visited the city in 1929 and said: &quot;If you want to see heaven on earth, come to Dubrovnik.&quot;

In the bay of Dubrovnik is the wooded island of Lokrum, where according to legend, Richard the Lionheart, King of England, was cast ashore after being shipwrecked in 1192. The island includes a fortress, botanical garden, monastery and naturist beach.

Among the many tourist destinations are a few beaches. Banje, Dubrovnik&#x27;s main public beach, is home to the Eastwest Beach Club. There is also Copacabana Beach, a stony beach on the Lapad peninsula, named after the popular beach in Rio de Janeiro.

By 2018, the city had to take steps to reduce the excessive number of tourists, especially in the Old Town. One method to moderate the overcrowding was to stagger the arrival/departure times of cruise ships to spread the number of visitors more evenly during the week. In 2023, Dubrovnik&#x27;s mayor closed the terrace of a bar in Stradun for the nuisance it created for the neighborhood and announced a ban on wheeled luggage in the old town to limit noise on paved streets of the Old Town.

===Important monuments===

Few of Dubrovnik&#x27;s Renaissance buildings survived the earthquake of 1667 but enough remained to give an idea of the city&#x27;s architectural heritage. The finest Renaissance highlight is the Sponza Palace which dates from the 16th century and is currently used to house the National Archives. The Rector&#x27;s Palace is a Gothic-Renaissance structure that displays finely carved capitals and an ornate staircase. It now houses a museum. Its façade is depicted on the reverse of the Croatian 50 kuna banknote, issued in 1993 and 2002. The St. Saviour Church is another remnant of the Renaissance period, next to the much-visited Franciscan Church and Monastery. The Franciscan monastery&#x27;s library possesses 30,000 volumes, 216 incunabula, and 1,500 valuable handwritten documents. Exhibits include a 15th-century silver-gilt cross and silver thurible, an 18th-century crucifix from Jerusalem, a martyrology (1541) by Bemardin Gucetic and illuminated psalters.

Dubrovnik&#x27;s most beloved church is St Blaise&#x27;s church, built in the 18th century in honour of Dubrovnik&#x27;s patron saint. Dubrovnik&#x27;s Baroque Cathedral was built in the 18th century and houses an impressive Treasury with relics of Saint Blaise. The city&#x27;s Dominican Monastery resembles a fortress on the outside but the interior contains an art museum and a Gothic-Romanesque church. A special treasure of the Dominican monastery is its library with 216 incunabula, numerous illustrated manuscripts, a rich archive with precious manuscripts, documents and an extensive art collection.

The Neapolitan architect and engineer Onofrio della Cava completed the aqueduct with two public fountains, both built in 1438. Close to the Pile Gate stands the Big Onofrio&#x27;s Fountain in the middle of a small square. It may have been inspired by the former Romanesque baptistry of the former cathedral in Bunić Square. The sculptural elements were lost in the earthquake of 1667. Water jets gush out of the mouth of the sixteen mascarons. The Little Onofrio&#x27;s Fountain stands at the eastern side of the Placa, supplying water to the market place in the Luža Square. The sculptures were made by the Milanese artist Pietro di Martino (who also sculpted the ornaments in the Rector&#x27;s Palace and made a statue – now lost – for the Franciscan church).

The Dubrovnik Bell Tower, built in 1444, is one of the symbols of the free city state of Ragusa. It was built by the local architects Grubačević, Utišenović and Radončić. It was rebuilt in 1929 as it had lost its stability through an earthquake and was in danger of falling. The brass face of the clock shows the phases of the moon. Two human figures strike the bell every hour. The tower stands next to the House of the Main Guard, also built in Gothic style. It was the residence of the admiral, commander-in-chief of the army. The Baroque portal was built between 1706 and 1708 by the Venetian architect Marino Gropelli (who also built St Blaise&#x27;s church).
In 1418, the Republic of Ragusa, as Dubrovnik was then named, erected a statue of Roland (Ital. Orlando) as a symbol of loyalty to Sigismund of Luxembourg (1368–1437), King of Hungary and Croatia (as of 1387), Prince-Elector of Brandenburg (between 1378 and 1388 and again between 1411 and 1415), German King (as of 1411), King of Bohemia (as of 1419) and Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire (as of 1433), who helped by a successful war alliance against Venice to retain Ragusa&#x27;s independence. It stands in the middle of Luža Square. Roland statues were typical symbols of city autonomy or independence, often erected under Sigismund in his Electorate of Brandenburg. In 1419 the sculptor Bonino of Milano, with the help of local craftsmen, replaced the first Roland with the present Gothic statue. Its forearm was for a long time the unit of measure in Dubrovnik: one ell of Dubrovnik is equal to .
===Walls of Dubrovnik===

A feature of Dubrovnik is its walls which run almost around the city. The walls are thick on the landward side but are much thinner on the seaward side. The system of turrets and towers was intended to protect the vulnerable city. The walls of Dubrovnik have also been a popular filming location for the fictional city of King&#x27;s Landing in the HBO television series, &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;.
The walls have been visited by 1.3 million people in 2018.

==Demographics==

The total population of the city is 41,562 (census 2021), in the following settlements:

* Bosanka, population 139

* Sustjepan, population 323
* Šipanska Luka, population 211
* Šumet, population 176
* Trsteno, population 222
* Zaton, population 985
The population was 42,615 in 2011, down from 49,728 in 1991

In the 2011 census, 90.34% of the population identified as Croat, 3.52% as Bosniak, 2.73% as Serb and 0.51% as Albanian.

The official language of the ancient Republic of Ragusa was Italian from 1492 to 1807. For this reason, historically, there was a significant community of Italians in Dubrovnik, the Dalmatian Italians. According to the Austrian censuses they were 331 Dalmatian Italians (4.6% of the total population) in 1890, 548 (6.5%) in 1900 and 409 (4.6%) in 1910. Their number dropped drastically following the Istrian-Dalmatian exodus, which took place from 1943 to 1960. From the 2011 Croatian census, there are 27 Dalmatian Italians present in Dubrovnik, correspond to 0.06% of the total population.

==Transport==

Dubrovnik has its own international airport, located approximately southeast of Dubrovnik city centre, near Čilipi. Buses connect the airport with the Dubrovnik old main bus station in Gruž. In addition, a network of modern, local buses connects all Dubrovnik neighbourhoods running frequently from dawn to midnight. However, Dubrovnik, unlike Croatia&#x27;s other major centres, is not accessible by rail; until 1975 Dubrovnik was connected to Mostar and Sarajevo by a narrow-gauge railway (760 mm) built during the Austro-Hungarian rule of Bosnia.

The A1 highway, in use between Zagreb and Ploče, is planned to be extended all the way to Dubrovnik. Because the area around the city is disconnected from the rest of Croatian territory, the highway will either cross the Pelješac Bridge whose construction was completed in 2022, or run through Neum in Bosnia and Herzegovina and continue to Dubrovnik.

==Education==
Dubrovnik has a number of higher educational institutions. These include the University of Dubrovnik, the Libertas University (Dubrovnik International University), Rochester Institute of Technology Croatia (former American College of Management and Technology), a University Centre for Postgraduate Studies of the University of Zagreb, and an Institute of History of the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts.

==Sports==
The city will host the 2025 World Men&#x27;s Handball Championship at the new arena, along with the countries Denmark and Norway.

Local football club NK GOŠK Dubrovnik has been playing in the third tier of the Croatian football pyramid for years.

Local waterpolo club VK Jug is among the most successful in Croatian history, with many of its players being members of the Croatia national water polo team.

==In popular culture==

Roger Corman&#x27;s 1964 war thriller &quot;The Secret Invasion&quot; is set in Dubrovnik and was filmed on location there. Although the story is fiction the fighting between Italian and German troops depicted at the end is based on fact.

The HBO series &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; used Dubrovnik as a filming location, representing the cities of King&#x27;s Landing and Qarth.

Parts of &quot;Star Wars: The Last Jedi&quot; were filmed in Dubrovnik in March 2016, in which Dubrovnik was used as the setting for the casino city of Canto Bight.

Dubrovnik was one of the European sites used in the Bollywood movie &quot;Fan&quot; (2016), starring Shah Rukh Khan.

In early 2017, &quot;Robin Hood&quot; was filmed on locations in Dubrovnik.

In Kander and Ebb&#x27;s song &quot;Ring Them Bells&quot;, the protagonist, Shirley Devore, goes to Dubrovnik to look for a husband and meets her neighbor from New York.

The text-based video game &quot;Quarantine Circular&quot; is set aboard a ship off the coast of Dubrovnik, and a few references to the city are made throughout the course of the game.

The Dubrovniks were an Australian Independent rock band formed in 1987. Often regarded as a &#x27;Supergroup&#x27; due to the band members having played in various established bands such as Hoodoo Gurus, Beasts of Bourbon, and The Scientists. The band chose their name due to two members of the band Roddy Radalj (guitar vocals) and Boris Sujdovik (bass) being born in Dubrovnik.

<text>Juliette Binoche (; born 9 March 1964) is a French actress. She has appeared in more than 60 films, particularly in French and English languages, and has been the recipient of numerous accolades, including an Academy Award, a British Academy Film Award and a César Award.

Binoche first gained recognition for working with such auteur directors as Jean-Luc Godard (&quot;Hail Mary&quot;, 1985), Jacques Doillon (&quot;Family Life&quot;, 1985), and André Téchiné; the latter made her a star in France with a leading role in his drama &quot;Rendez-vous&quot; (1985). She won the Volpi Cup and César Award for Best Actress for her performance as a grieving music composer in Krzysztof Kieślowski&#x27;s &quot;Three Colours: Blue&quot; (1993) and the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for playing a nurse in &quot;The English Patient&quot; (1996). For starring in the romantic film &quot;Chocolat&quot; (2000), Binoche received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress. In 2010, she won the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actress for her role as an antiques dealer in Abbas Kiarostami&#x27;s &quot;Certified Copy&quot;. Binoche has since starred in such films as &quot;Clouds of Sils Maria&quot; (2014), &quot;High Life&quot; (2018) and &quot;The Taste of Things&quot; (2023).

Binoche has appeared on stage intermittently, most notably in a 1998 London production of Luigi Pirandello&#x27;s &quot;Naked&quot; and in a 2000 production of Harold Pinter&#x27;s &quot;Betrayal&quot; on Broadway for which she was nominated for a Tony Award. In 2008, she began a world tour with a modern dance production &quot;in-i&quot; devised in collaboration with Akram Khan.

==Early life==
Binoche was born in Paris, the daughter of Jean-Marie Binoche, a director, actor, and sculptor, and Monique Yvette Stalens (born 1939), a teacher, director, and actress. Her father, who is French, also has one eighth Portuguese-Brazilian ancestry; he was raised partly in Morocco by his French-born parents. Her mother was born in Częstochowa, Poland. Binoche&#x27;s maternal grandfather, Andre Stalens, was born in Poland, of Belgian (Walloon) and French descent, and Binoche&#x27;s maternal grandmother, Julia Helena Młynarczyk, was of Polish origin. Both of them were actors who were born in Częstochowa; the German Nazi occupiers imprisoned them at Auschwitz as intellectuals.

Her great-uncle was Léon Binoche, who won a gold medal in rugby at the 1900 Paris Olympics. 

When Binoche&#x27;s parents divorced in 1968, four-year-old Juliette and her sister Marion were sent to a provincial boarding school. During their teens, the Binoche sisters spent their school holidays with their maternal grandmother, not seeing their parents for months at a time. Binoche has stated that this perceived parental abandonment had a profound effect on her.

She was not particularly academic and in her teenage years began acting at school in amateur stage productions. At seventeen, she directed and starred in a student production of the Eugène Ionesco play, &quot;Exit the King&quot;. She studied acting at the &quot;Conservatoire National Supérieur d&#x27;Art Dramatique&quot; (CNSAD), but quit after a short time as she disliked the curriculum. In the early 1980s, she found an agent through a friend and joined a theater troupe, touring France, Belgium and Switzerland under the pseudonym &quot;Juliette Adrienne&quot;. Around this time, she began lessons with acting coach Vera Gregh.

Her first professional screen experience came as an extra in the three-part TF1 television series &quot;Dorothée, danseuse de corde&quot; (1983) directed by Jacques Fansten, followed by a similarly small role in the provincial television film &quot;Fort bloque&quot; directed by Pierrick Guinnard. After this, Binoche secured her first feature-film appearance with a minor role in Pascal Kané&#x27;s &quot;Liberty Belle&quot; (1983). Her role required just two days on-set, but was enough to inspire Binoche to pursue a career in film.

==Career==

===1984–1991===

Binoche&#x27;s early films established her as a French star of some renown. In 1983, she auditioned for the female lead in Jean-Luc Godard&#x27;s controversial &quot;Hail Mary&quot;, a modern retelling of the Virgin birth. Godard requested a meeting with Binoche having seen a photo of her taken by her boyfriend at the time. Although she said she spent six months on the film&#x27;s set in Geneva, her presence in the final cut is confined to just a few scenes. Further supporting roles followed in a variety of French films. Annick Lanoë&#x27;s &quot;Les Nanas&quot; gave Binoche her most noteworthy role to date, playing opposite established stars Marie-France Pisier and Macha Méril in a mainstream comedy, though she has stated the experience was not particularly memorable or influential. She gained more significant exposure in Jacques Doillon&#x27;s critically acclaimed &quot;Family Life&quot; cast as the volatile teenage step-daughter of Sami Frey&#x27;s central character. This film was to set the tone of her early career. Doillon has commented that in the original screenplay her character was written to be 14 years old, but he was so impressed with Binoche&#x27;s audition he changed the character&#x27;s age to 17 to allow her take the role. In April 1985, Binoche followed this with another supporting role in Bob Decout&#x27;s &quot;Adieu Blaireau&quot;, a &quot;policier&quot; thriller starring Philippe Léotard and Annie Girardot. &quot;Adieu Blaireau&quot; failed to have much impact with critics or audiences.

It was to be later in 1985 that Binoche would fully emerge as a leading actress with her role in André Téchiné&#x27;s &quot;Rendez-vous&quot;. She was cast at short notice when Sandrine Bonnaire had to abandon the film due to a scheduling conflict. &quot;Rendez-vous&quot; premiered at the 1985 Cannes Film Festival, winning Best Director. The film was a sensation and Binoche became the darling of the festival. &quot;Rendez-Vous&quot; is the story of a provincial actress, Nina (Binoche), who arrives in Paris and embarks on a series of dysfunctional liaisons with several men, including the moody, suicidal Quentin (Lambert Wilson). However it is her collaboration with theater director Scrutzler, played by Jean-Louis Trintignant, which comes to define Nina. In a review of &quot;Rendez-Vous&quot; in Film Comment, Armond White described it as &quot;Juliette Binoche&#x27;s career-defining performance&quot;.

In 1986, Binoche was nominated for her first César for Best Actress in a Leading Role for her performance in the film. Following &quot;Rendez-Vous&quot;, she was unsure of what role to take next. She auditioned unsuccessfully for Yves Boisset&#x27;s &quot;Bleu comme l&#x27;enfer&quot; and Robin Davis&#x27;s &quot;Hors la loi&quot;, but was eventually cast in &quot;My Brother-in-Law Killed My Sister&quot; (1986) by Jacques Rouffio opposite the popular French stars Michel Serrault and Michel Piccoli. This film was a critical and commercial failure. Binoche has commented that Rouffio&#x27;s film is very significant to her career as it taught her to judge roles based on the quality of the screenplay and her connection with a director, not on the reputation of other cast members. Later in 1986, she again starred opposite Michel Piccoli in Leos Carax&#x27;s &quot;Mauvais Sang&quot;. This film was a critical and commercial success, leading to Binoche&#x27;s second César nomination. &quot;Mauvais Sang&quot; is an avant-garde thriller in which she plays Anna the vastly younger lover of Marc (Piccoli) who falls in love with Alex (Denis Lavant), a young thief. Binoche has stated that she, &quot;discovered the camera&quot;, while shooting this film.

In August 1986, Binoche began filming Philip Kaufman&#x27;s adaptation of Milan Kundera&#x27;s novel &quot;The Unbearable Lightness of Being&quot;, portraying the young and innocent Tereza. Released in 1988, this was Binoche&#x27;s first English language role and was a worldwide success with critics and audiences alike. Set against the USSR&#x27;s invasion of Prague in 1968, the film tells the story of the relationships a Czech surgeon, Tomas (Daniel Day-Lewis), has with his wife Tereza and his lover Sabina (Lena Olin). Binoche has stated that at the time her English was very limited and that she relied on a French translation to fully grasp her role. After this success, Binoche decided to return to France rather than pursue an international career. In 1988, she filmed the lead in Pierre Pradinas&#x27;s &quot;Un tour de manège&quot;, a little-seen French film opposite François Cluzet. She has stated that her attraction to this film was that it gave her the opportunity to work with close friends and family. Pradinas is the husband of her sister Marion Stalens who was set photographer on the film and appeared in a cameo role. In the summer of 1988, Binoche returned to the stage in an acclaimed production of Anton Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;The Seagull&quot; directed by Russian director Andrei Konchalovsky at Théâtre de l&#x27;Odéon in Paris.

Later that year, she began work on Leos Carax&#x27;s &quot;Les Amants du Pont-Neuf&quot;. The film was beset by problems and took three years to complete, requiring investment from three producers and funds from the French government. When finally released in 1991, &quot;Les Amants du Pont-Neuf&quot; was a critical success. Binoche won a European Film Award as well as securing her third César nomination for her performance. In the film Binoche portrays an artist who lives rough on the famous Parisian bridge where she meets another young vagrant (Denis Lavant). This iconic part of the city becomes the backdrop for a wildly passionate love story and some of the most visually arresting images of the city ever created. The paintings featured in the film were Binoche&#x27;s own work. She also designed the French poster for the film which features an ink drawing of the eponymous lovers locked in embrace. During a break in filming in 1990, Binoche spent five days shooting &quot;Mara&quot; for Mike Figgis, based on Henry Miller&#x27;s &quot;Quiet Days in Clichy&quot;. This 30-minute film was part of HBO&#x27;s anthology series &quot;Women &amp; Men 2&quot;. The film became somewhat contentious when, according to Mike Figgis, HBO altered it once he had completed it. The film premiered on HBO in the U.S. on 18 August 1991.

At this point, Binoche seemed to be at a crossroads in her career. She was recognized as one of the most significant French actresses of her generation. However, the long production of &quot;Les Amants du Pont-Neuf&quot; had forced her to turn down several significant roles in international productions including &quot;The Double Life of Véronique&quot; by Krzysztof Kieślowski, &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot; by Jean-Paul Rappeneau, &quot;Night and Day&quot; by Chantal Akerman, and &quot;Beyond the Aegean&quot;, an aborted project with Elia Kazan. Binoche then chose to pursue an international career outside France.

===1992–2000===

In the 1990s, Binoche was cast in a series of critically and commercially successful international films, winning her praise and awards. In this period, her persona developed from that of a young gamine to a more melancholic, tragic presence. Critics suggested that many of her roles were notable for her almost passive intensity in the face of tragedy and despair. In fact, Binoche has nicknamed her characters from this period as her &quot;sorrowful sisters&quot;. Following the long shoot of &quot;Les Amants du Pont-Neuf&quot;, Binoche relocated to London for the 1992 productions of &quot;Emily Brontë&#x27;s Wuthering Heights&quot; and &quot;Damage&quot;, both of which considerably enhanced her international reputation. Yet, from a professional and personal point of view, both films were significant challenges for Binoche; her casting opposite Ralph Fiennes&#x27;s Heathcliff in &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, instead of English actresses Helena Bonham Carter and Kate Beckinsale, was immediately contentious and drew derision from the British press, unimpressed that a uniquely English role had gone to a French actress. The film had its world premiere at the 1992 Edinburgh International Film Festival. Reviews were poor, with Binoche being cynically dubbed &quot;Cathy Clouseau&quot; and derided for her &quot;franglais&quot; accent. Both Binoche and director Peter Kosminsky distanced themselves from the film, with Binoche refusing to do any promotion for the film or to redub it into French.

&quot;Damage&quot;, a UK and French co-production, is the story of a British Conservative minister played by Jeremy Irons who embarks on a torrid affair with his son&#x27;s fiancée (Binoche). Based on the novel by Josephine Hart and directed by veteran French director Louis Malle, &quot;Damage&quot; seemed to be the ideal international vehicle for Binoche; however the production was fraught with difficulties and dogged by rumours of serious conflict. In an on-set interview, Malle stated that it was the &quot;most difficult&quot; film he had ever made, while Binoche commented that &quot;the first day was one big argument&quot;. &quot;Damage&quot; opened in the UK late in 1992 and debuted early in 1993 on US screens. Reviews were somewhat mixed. For her performance, Binoche received her fourth César nomination.

In 1993, she appeared in Krzysztof Kieślowski&#x27;s &quot;Three Colours: Blue&quot; to much critical acclaim. The first film in a trilogy inspired by the ideals of the French republic and the colors of its flag, &quot;Three Colors: Blue&quot; is the story of a young woman who loses her composer husband and daughter in a car accident. Though devastated she learns to cope by rejecting her previous life in favor of conscious &quot;nothing&quot;; rejecting all people, belongings and emotions. &quot;Three Colours: Blue&quot; premiered at the 1993 Venice Film Festival, landing Binoche the Best Actress Prize. She also won a César, and a nomination for the Golden Globe. Binoche has said her inspirations for the role were her friend and coach Vernice Klier who suffered a similar tragedy, and the book &quot;The Black Veil&quot; by Anny Duperey which deals with the author&#x27;s grief at losing her parents at a young age. Binoche made cameo appearances in the other two films in Kieślowski&#x27;s trilogy, &quot;Three Colours: White&quot; and &quot;Three Colours: Red&quot;. Around this time, Steven Spielberg offered her roles in &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; and &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot;. She turned down both parts. After the success of &quot;Three Colors: Blue&quot;, Binoche took a short sabbatical during which she gave birth to her son Raphaël in September 1993.

In 1995, Binoche returned to the screen in a big-budget adaptation of Jean Giono&#x27;s &quot;The Horseman on the Roof&quot; directed by Jean-Paul Rappeneau. The film was particularly significant in France as it was at the time the most expensive film in the history of French cinema. The film was a box office success around the world and Binoche was again nominated for a César for Best Actress. This role, as a romantic heroine, was to influence the direction of many of her subsequent roles in the late 1990s. In 1996, Binoche appeared in her first comedic role since &quot;My Brother-in-Law Killed My Sister&quot; a decade before; &quot;A Couch in New York&quot; was directed by Chantal Akerman and co-starred William Hurt. This screw-ball comedy tells the story of a New York psychiatrist who swaps homes with a Parisian dancer. The film was a critical and commercial failure. &quot;Three Colors: Blue&quot;, &quot;The Horseman on the Roof&quot; and &quot;A Couch in New York&quot; all gave Binoche the opportunity to work with prestigious directors she had turned down during the prolonged shoot of &quot;Les Amants du Pont-Neuf&quot;.

Her next role in &quot;The English Patient&quot; reinforced her position as an international movie star. The film, based on the novel by Michael Ondaatje and directed by Anthony Minghella, was a worldwide hit. Produced by Saul Zaentz, producer of &quot;The Unbearable Lightness of Being&quot;, the film reunited Juliette Binoche with Ralph Fiennes, Heathcliff to her Cathy four years previously. Binoche has said that the shoot on location in Tuscany and at the famed Cinecittà in Rome was among the happiest professional experiences of her career. The film, which tells the story of a badly burned, mysterious man found in the wreckage of a plane during World War II, won nine Academy Awards, including Best Supporting Actress for Juliette Binoche. With this film, she became the second French actress to win an Oscar, following Simone Signoret&#x27;s win for &quot;Room at the Top&quot; in 1960. After this international hit, Binoche returned to France and began work opposite Daniel Auteuil on Claude Berri&#x27;s &quot;Lucie Aubrac&quot;, the true story of a French Resistance heroine. Binoche was released from the film six weeks into the shoot due to differences with Berri regarding the authenticity of his script. Binoche has described this event as being like &quot;an earthquake&quot; to her.
Next, Binoche was reunited with director André Téchiné for &quot;Alice et Martin&quot; (1998), the story of a relationship between an emotionally damaged Parisian musician and her younger lover who hides a dark family secret. The film failed to find an audience in France, although it was critically acclaimed in the UK. In February 1998, Binoche made her London stage debut in a new version of Luigi Pirandello&#x27;s &quot;Clothe the Naked&quot; re-titled &quot;Naked&quot; and adapted by Nicolas Wright. The production, directed by Jonathan Kent, was very favorably received. Following this acclaimed performance, she returned to French screens with &quot;Children of the Century&quot; (1999), a big budget romantic epic, in which she played 19th-century French proto-feminist author George Sand. The film depicted Sand&#x27;s affair with the poet and dandy Alfred de Musset played by Benoît Magimel. The following year saw Binoche in four contrasting roles, each of which enhanced her reputation. &quot;La Veuve de Saint-Pierre&quot; (2000) by Patrice Leconte, for which she was nominated for a César for Best Actress, was a period drama which saw Binoche appear opposite Daniel Auteuil in the role of a woman who attempts to save a condemned man from the guillotine. The film won favorable reviews, particularly in the U.S. where it was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film.

Next, she appeared in Michael Haneke&#x27;s &quot;Code Unknown&quot;, a film which was made following Binoche&#x27;s approach to the Austrian director. The film premiered in competition at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival. This critically acclaimed role was a welcome change from playing the romantic heroine in a series of costume dramas. Later that year, Binoche made her Broadway debut in an adaptation of Harold Pinter&#x27;s &quot;Betrayal&quot; for which she was nominated for a Tony Award. Staged by the Roundabout Theatre Company and directed by David Leveaux, the production also featured Liev Schreiber and John Slattery. Back on screen, Binoche was the heroine of the Lasse Hallström film &quot;Chocolat&quot; from the best selling novel by Joanne Harris. For her role Binoche won a European Film Audience Award for Best Actress and was nominated for an Academy Award and a BAFTA. &quot;Chocolat&quot; is the story of a mysterious stranger who opens a &quot;chocolaterie&quot; in a conservative French village in 1959. The film was a worldwide hit.

Between 1995 and 2000, Binoche was the advertising face of the Lancôme perfume &quot;Poème&quot;, her image adorning print campaigns photographed by Richard Avedon and a television advertising campaign, including an advert directed by Anthony Minghella and scored by Gabriel Yared. By the end of this period and following roles in a number of prestige productions, critics were wondering if Binoche was typecast as the tragic, despairing muse. In a feature article entitled &quot;The Erotic Face&quot; in the June 2000 edition of British film criticism magazine &quot;Sight and Sound&quot;, Ginette Vincendeau pondered Binoche&#x27;s persona; Vincendeau suggested that the fixation of numerous directors upon her face had led to an erasure of her body, and to her being perceived only as a romantic icon rather than a versatile actress.

===2001–2006===

After the success of &quot;Chocolat&quot;, Binoche was internationally recognized as an A-list movie star in the early 2000s, but as an actor her persona became somewhat fixed following a series of period roles portraying a stoic heroine facing tragedy and desolation. Keen to try something new, Binoche returned to French cinema in 2002 in an unlikely role: she played a ditsy beautician in &quot;Jet Lag&quot; opposite Jean Reno. The film, directed by Daniele Thompson, was a box office hit in France and Binoche was once again nominated for a César for Best Actress. The film tells the story of a couple who meet at an airport during a strike. Initially the pair despises each other, but, over the course of one night, they find common ground and maybe even love. This playful spirit continued when Binoche featured in a 2003 Italian television commercial for the chocolates Ferrero Rocher. The advertisement played upon her &quot;Chocolat&quot; persona featuring Binoche handing out the chocolates to people on the streets of Paris.

In a more serious vein, Binoche traveled to South Africa to make John Boorman&#x27;s &quot;In My Country&quot; (2004) opposite Samuel L. Jackson. Based on the book &quot;Country of My Skull&quot; by Antjie Krog, the film examines The Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) hearings following the abolition of Apartheid in the mid-1990s. Although the film premiered at the 2004 Berlin International Film Festival, it received much criticism for the inclusion of a fictional romantic liaison and for its depiction of black South Africans. Despite the negative reception, Binoche was extremely enthusiastic about the film and her connection with Boorman. Her sister, Marion Stalens, also traveled to South Africa to shoot a documentary, &quot;La réconciliation?&quot;, which explores the TRC process and follows Binoche&#x27;s progress as she acts in Boorman&#x27;s film. Next, Binoche re-teamed with Michael Haneke for &quot;Caché&quot;. The film was an immediate success, winning best director for Haneke at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival, while Binoche was nominated for a European Film Award for Best Actress for her role. The film tells the story of a bourgeois Parisian couple, played by Binoche and Daniel Auteuil, who begin to receive anonymous videotapes containing footage shot over long periods, surveying the outside of their home. &quot;Caché&quot; went on to feature in the number one position on the &quot;Top 10 of the 2000s&quot; list published by The Times at the end of the decade.

Binoche&#x27;s next film, &quot;Bee Season&quot;, based on the celebrated novel by Myla Goldberg, cast her opposite Richard Gere. The film was not a success at the box office taking less than $5 million worldwide. For many critics the film, although intelligent, was &quot;distant and diffuse&quot;. &quot;Bee Season&quot; depicts the emotional disintegration of a family just as their daughter begins to win national spelling bees. &quot;Mary&quot; (2005) featured Binoche in a somewhat unlikely collaboration with the controversial American director Abel Ferrara for an investigation of modern faith and Mary Magdalene&#x27;s position within the Catholic Church. Featuring Forest Whitaker, Matthew Modine and Marion Cotillard, &quot;Mary&quot; was a success, winning the Grand Prix at the 2005 Venice Film Festival. Despite these accolades and favorable reviews, particularly from the cultural magazine &quot;Les Inrockuptibles&quot;, &quot;Mary&quot; failed to secure a distributor in key markets such as the US and the UK.

The Cannes Film Festival in 2006 saw Binoche feature in the anthology film &quot;Paris, je t&#x27;aime&quot; appearing in a section directed by the Japanese director Nobuhiro Suwa. Suwa&#x27;s &quot;Place des Victoires&quot; is the story of a grief-stricken mother who manages to have a final brief moment with her dead son. The segment also features Willem Dafoe and Hippolyte Girardot. &quot;Paris, je t&#x27;aime&quot; was a popular success, taking over $17 million, at the world box-office. In September 2006, Binoche appeared at the Venice Film Festival to launch &quot;A Few Days in September&quot;, written and directed by Santiago Amigorena. Despite an impressive cast including John Turturro, Nick Nolte and up-and-coming French star Sara Forestier, the film was a failure. &quot;A Few Days in September&quot; is a thriller set between 5 and 11 September 2001, in which Binoche plays a French secret service agent, who may, or may not, have information relating to impending attacks on the U.S. The film was the recipient of harsh criticism from the press for its perceived trivialisation of the events of 11 September 2001. While promoting the film in the UK, Binoche told an interviewer she believed the CIA and other government agencies must have had foreknowledge of the 11 September attacks, as depicted in the film.

Next, Binoche traveled to the 2006 Toronto International Film Festival for the premiere of &quot;Breaking and Entering&quot;, her second film with Anthony Minghella in the director&#x27;s chair, based on his first original screenplay since his breakthrough film &quot;Truly, Madly, Deeply&quot; (1991). In &quot;Breaking and Entering&quot;, Binoche played a Bosnian refugee living in London, while Jude Law co-starred as a well-to-do businessman drawn into her life via an act of deception. In preparation for her role, Binoche traveled to Sarajevo where she met women who had survived the war of the 1990s. Lushly photographed by Benoît Delhomme, &quot;Breaking and Entering&quot; portrays intersecting lives amongst the flux of urban renewal in inner-city London. Despite the fact that Binoche was praised for her performance, the film did not ring true for critics and failed to find an audience. In a review in &quot;Variety&quot;, Todd McCarthy writes that, &quot;Binoche, physically unchanged as ever, plays Amira&#x27;s controlled anguish with skill&quot;. &quot;Breaking and Entering&quot; also featured Robin Wright, Vera Farmiga, Juliet Stevenson, Rafi Gavron and Martin Freeman.

Although Binoche began the decade on a professional high with an Academy Award nomination for &quot;Chocolat&quot;, she struggled at the beginning of the 2000s to secure roles that did not confine her to the tragic, melancholic persona developed in the 1990s. Despite the huge success of &quot;Caché&quot;, other high-profile films such as &quot;In My Country&quot;, &quot;Bee Season&quot; and &quot;Breaking and Entering&quot; failed critically and commercially. Binoche again seemed to be at a crossroads in her career.

===2007–2012===
2007 was the start of a particularly busy period for Binoche, one that would see her take on diverse roles in a series of critically acclaimed international movies giving her film career a new impetus, as she shed the restrictions that seemed to have stifled her career in the early part of the decade. The Cannes Film Festival saw the premiere of &quot;Flight of the Red Balloon&quot; (2007) by the Taiwanese director Hou Hsiao-hsien. It was originally conceived as a short film to form part of a 20th anniversary tribute to the Musée d&#x27;Orsay, to be produced by Serge Lemoine, president of the museum. When that idea failed to find sufficient funding, Hou developed it into a feature-length film and secured the necessary financing. The film was well received by international critics and went on to debut around the world early in 2008. Paying homage to Albert Lamorisse&#x27;s 1957 short &quot;The Red Balloon&quot;, Hou&#x27;s film tells the story of a woman&#x27;s efforts to juggle her responsibilities as a single mother with her commitment to her career as a voice artist. Shot on location in Paris, the film was entirely improvised by the cast. The film was number one on the influential critic J. Hoberman&#x27;s &quot;Top 10 List&quot; for 2008 published in The Village Voice.

She was also honored with the Maureen O&#x27;Hara Award at the Kerry Film Festival in 2010, an award offered to women who have excelled in their chosen field in film.

&quot;Disengagement&quot; by Amos Gitai premiered out-of-competition at the 2007 Venice Film Festival. Co-starring Liron Levo and Jeanne Moreau, &quot;Disengagement&quot; is a political drama charting the story of a French woman, of Dutch/Palestinian origin, who goes in search of a daughter she abandoned 20 years previously on the Gaza strip. She arrives in Gaza during the 2005 Israeli disengagement. The film won the prestigious Premio Roberto Rossellini and was critically acclaimed, particularly by the eminent &quot;Cahiers du cinéma&quot;. However the film proved more controversial in Israel where state television station Channel 1 withdrew financial support for the film citing the &quot;left-wing nature of Gitai&#x27;s films&quot;.

In stark contrast, Peter Hedges co-wrote and directed the Disney-produced &quot;Dan in Real Life&quot;, a romantic comedy featuring Binoche alongside Steve Carell. It was released in October 2007, becoming a popular commercial success in the US, before debuting around the world in 2008. The film grossed over $65 million at the worldwide box-office. &quot;Dan in Real Life&quot; is the story of a widowed man (Carell) who meets, and instantly falls for, a woman (Binoche), only to discover she is the new girlfriend of his brother. The film also features Dane Cook, Emily Blunt and Dianne Wiest.

Back in France, Binoche experienced popular and critical success in &quot;Paris&quot; directed by Cédric Klapisch. &quot;Paris&quot; is Klapisch&#x27;s personal ode to the French capital and features an impressive ensemble of French talent, including Romain Duris, Fabrice Luchini and Mélanie Laurent. &quot;Paris&quot; was one of the most successful French films internationally in recent years, having grossed over $22 million at the world box office. Binoche and Klapisch had originally met on the set of &quot;Mauvais Sang&quot; in 1986, where Klapisch was working as a set electrician.

Also in France, &quot;Summer Hours&quot; (2008), directed by Olivier Assayas, is the critically acclaimed story of three siblings who struggle with the responsibility of disposing of their late mother&#x27;s valuable art collection. The film premiered in France in March 2008 and had its U.S. debut at the 2008 New York Film Festival, before going on general release in the U.S. on 19 May 2009. Widely acclaimed, the film was nominated for the Prix Louis Delluc in France and appeared on numerous U.S. &quot;Top 10 lists&quot;, including first place on David Edelstein&#x27;s &quot;Top 10 of 2009&quot; list in &quot;New York&quot; magazine, and J. R. Jones&#x27;s list in the Chicago Reader. &quot;Summer Hours&quot; also features Charles Berling, Jérémie Renier and Édith Scob.

In the autumn of 2008, Binoche starred in a theatrical dance production titled &quot;in-i&quot;, co-created with renowned choreographer Akram Khan. The show, a love story told through dance and dialogue, featured stage design by Anish Kapoor and music by Philip Sheppard. It premiered at the National Theatre in London before embarking on a world tour. &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; in the UK commented that, &quot;Binoche&#x27;s physical achievement is incredible: Khan is a master mover&quot;. The production was part of a &#x27;Binoche Season&#x27; titled &quot;Ju&#x27;Bi&#x27;lations&quot;, also featuring a retrospective of her film work and an exhibition of her paintings, which were also published in a bilingual book &quot;Portraits in Eyes&quot;. The book featured ink portraits of Binoche as each of her characters and of each director she had worked with up to that time. She also penned a few lines to each director.

In April 2006 and again in December 2007, Binoche traveled to Tehran at the invitation of Abbas Kiarostami. While there in 2007, she shot a cameo appearance in his film &quot;Shirin&quot; (2008) which he was shooting at the time. Binoche&#x27;s visit proved controversial when two Iranian MPs raised the matter in parliament, advising more caution be exercised in granting visas to foreign celebrities which might lead to &quot;cultural destruction&quot;. In June 2009, Binoche began work on &quot;Certified Copy&quot; directed by Kiarostami. The film was an Official Selection in competition at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival. Binoche won the Best Actress Award at the festival for her performance. The film went on general release in France on 19 May 2010 to very positive reviews. Her win at the 2010 Cannes Film festival makes Binoche the first actress to win the European &quot;best actress triple crown&quot;: Best Actress at Venice for &quot;Three Colors: Blue&quot;, Best Actress at Berlin for &quot;The English Patient&quot; and Best Actress at Cannes for &quot;Certified Copy&quot;. The September 2010 UK release of the film was overshadowed when French actor Gérard Depardieu made disparaging comments about Binoche to the Austrian magazine &quot;Profil&quot;, &quot;Please can you explain to me what the mystery of Juliette Binoche is meant to be?&quot; he said. &quot;I would really like to know why she has been so esteemed for so many years. She has nothing – absolutely nothing&quot;. In response, while promoting &quot;Certified Copy&quot;, Binoche spoke to movie magazine &quot;Empire&quot; saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t know him. I understand you don&#x27;t have to like everyone and you can dislike someone&#x27;s work. But I don&#x27;t understand the violence [of his statements]... I do not understand why he is behaving like this. It is his problem.&quot; &quot;Certified Copy&quot; proved to be controversial in Kiarostami&#x27;s homeland when Iranian authorities announced on 27 May 2010 that the film was to be banned in Iran, apparently due to Binoche&#x27;s attire; Deputy Culture Minister Javad Shamaqdari is quoted as saying, &quot;If Juliette Binoche were better clad it could have been screened but due to her attire there will not be a general screening.&quot;
Following the success of &quot;Certified Copy&quot;, Binoche appeared in a brief supporting role in &quot;The Son of No One&quot; for American writer and director Dito Montiel. The film also stars Channing Tatum, Al Pacino and Ray Liotta. &quot;The Son of No One&quot; premiered at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival to fairly negative reaction. It was acquired by Anchor Bay Entertainment for distribution in the US and other key territories arriving in selected US cinemas on 4 November 2011. , according to film review aggregator &quot;Rotten Tomatoes&quot;, &quot;The Son of No One&quot; is Juliette Binoche&#x27;s least critically successful film, with only 18% of critics giving it a positive review.

In June 2010, Binoche started work on &quot;Elles&quot; for Polish director Małgorzata Szumowska. &quot;Elles&quot;, produced under the working title &quot;Sponsoring&quot;, is an examination of teenage prostitution with Juliette Binoche playing a journalist for &quot;ELLE&quot;. The film was released in France on 1 February 2012. On 12 January 2011, Variety announced that Juliette Binoche would star in &quot;Another Woman&#x27;s Life&quot; loosely based on the novel &quot;La Vie d&#x27;une Autre&quot; by Frédérique Deghelt. Released in France on 15 February 2012, the film is the directorial debut of the French actress Sylvie Testud and co-stars actor/director Mathieu Kassovitz. &quot;Another Woman&#x27;s Life&quot; is the story of Marie (Binoche) a young woman who meets and spends the night with Paul (Kassovitz). When she wakes up, she discovers that 15 years have passed. With no memory of these years she learns she has acquired an impressive career, a son and a marriage to Paul which seems headed for divorce. The film met with generally mixed reviews in France.

On 17 February 2011, Screendaily announced that Binoche had been cast in David Cronenberg&#x27;s film &quot;Cosmopolis&quot; with Robert Pattinson, Paul Giamatti, Mathieu Amalric, and Samantha Morton. Binoche appeared in a supporting role as a New York art dealer, Didi Fancher, who is having an affair with Pattinson&#x27;s Eric Packer. The film, produced by Paulo Branco, began principal photography on 24 May 2011 and was released in 2012, following a competition slot at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival. &quot;Cosmopolis&quot; received mixed reviews from critics. August 2012 saw the French release of &quot;An Open Heart&quot; opposite Édgar Ramírez and directed by Marion Laine. Based on the novel &quot;Remonter l&#x27;Orénoque&quot; by Mathias Énard, the film is the story of the obsessive relationship between two highly successful surgeons. The film depicts the consequences of an unexpected pregnancy and alcoholism upon their relationship. The second film directed by Laine, &quot;An Open Heart&quot; met with tepid reviews in France and poor box office receipts.

===2013–present===

Released at the 2013 Berlin International Film Festival, Bruno Dumont&#x27;s &quot;Camille Claudel 1915&quot; is a drama recounting three days of the 30 years French artist Camille Claudel (Binoche) spent in a mental asylum though she had not been diagnosed with any malady. The film examines Claudel&#x27;s fight to maintain her sanity and find creative inspiration while awaiting a visit from her brother, the poet Paul Claudel. The film received excellent reviews with Binoche in particular gaining praise for her performance.

Following this, Binoche completed work on &quot;A Thousand Times Good Night&quot; for director Erik Poppe in which she plays a war photographer and the romantic drama &quot;Words and Pictures&quot; with Clive Owen from veteran director Fred Schepisi. She co-starred in Gareth Edwards&#x27;s &quot;Godzilla&quot;, which was theatrically released in May 2014. August 2013 saw Binoche reunite with Olivier Assayas for &quot;Clouds of Sils Maria&quot;. The film was written especially for Binoche and plot elements parallel her life. It also featured Kristen Stewart and Chloë Grace Moretz. The film had its debut at Cannes 2014. Following this role Binoche was slated to appear in &quot;Nobody Wants the Night&quot; by Isabel Coixet which was due to begin shooting late in 2013.

In 2015, Binoche starred on stage in a new English language translation of &quot;Antigone&quot;. Directed by Ivo van Hove, the production had a world premier in Luxembourg at the end of February. Then, it embarked an international tour to London, Antwerp, Amsterdam, Edinburgh, Paris, Recklinghausen and New York.

Binoche narrated the new documentary film titled &quot;Talking about Rose&quot; about the Chad soldier Rose Lokissim who fought against Hissène Habré&#x27;s dictatorship in the 1980s.

In 2016, Binoche reunited with Bruno Dumont for a comedy film &quot;Slack Bay&quot;. The 2016 Cannes Film Festival saw the première of &quot;Slack Bay&quot; (&quot;Ma Loute&quot;), also starring Fabrice Luchini and Valeria Bruni Tedeschi, which is a burlesque comedy based in the Ambleteuse region of Northern France. Set in 1910, the film tells the unusual story of two families linked by an unlikely romance. &quot;Ma Loute&quot; won much praise from French critics and was a popular success at the French box office.

Following the success of her reunion with Bruno Dumont, Juliette Binoche next made a special appearance in &quot;Polina, danser sa vie&quot; (2016) directed by Valérie Müller and Angelin Preljocaj, focusing on the story of a gifted Russian ballerina, Polina (Anastasia Shevtsoda). From Moscow to Aix-En-Provence and Antwerp, from success to disillusion, we follow Polina&#x27;s incredible destiny. Binoche portrays a choreographer, Liria Elsaj, who awakens a desire in Polina to move away from classical ballet to explore more contemporary dance. In October 2017, she performed Barbara&#x27;s autobiographical prose in the Philharmonie de Paris, accompanied by the French pianist Alexandre Tharaud.

&quot;Telle mère, telle fille&quot; (&quot;Like Mother, Like Daughter&quot;) (2017) is a comedy from Noémie Saglio and features Binoche as a free-wheeling 47-year-old who falls pregnant at the same time as her uptight daughter Avril (Camille Cottin). The film also features Lambert Wilson, reuniting with Binoche 32 years after they were a sensation at the 1985 Cannes Film Festival in André Téchiné&#x27;s &quot;Rendez-Vous&quot;. In May 2017 Binoche and Cottin appeared together again, this time on the small screen in the final episode of the second season of &quot;Dix Pour Cent&quot; (&quot;Call My Agent&quot;) where Juliette Binoche played herself in a tongue-in-cheek episode centering on the Cannes Film Festival.

Returning to the big screen, Binoche next appeared in a supporting role in Rupert Sanders&#x27;s big screen adaptation of the cult manga &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; (2017). Binoche played Dr Ouelet, a scientist with the Hanka organization responsible for creating the ghost in the shell, Major, portrayed by Scarlett Johansson. Binoche, Sanders and Johansson did extensive promotion for the film in the US, Japan, Europe and Australia.

May 2017 saw the première of Claire Denis&#x27;s &quot;Un Beau Soleil Intérieur&quot; (&quot;Let the Sunshine In&quot;) (2017) at the Quinzaine des Réalisateurs selection at the Cannes Film Festival. The film is the story of a middle-aged Parisian artist, Isabelle (Binoche), who is searching for true love at last. The film depicts her many encounters with a number of unsuitable men. The film also features Xavier Beauvois, Nicolas Duvauchelle, Josiane Balasko, Valeria-Bruni Tedeschi and Gérard Depardieu. &quot;Un Beau Soleil Intérieur&quot; was a success with audiences and critics around the world.

Next, Binoche appeared in Naomi Kawase&#x27;s &quot;Vision&quot; (2018). Following that, she reunited with Claire Denis for the English language &quot;High Life&quot; (2018), Olivier Assayas for &quot;Doubles Vies&quot; (2019) and Patrice Leconte for &quot;La maison vide&quot; (2019).

In 2024, the Board of the European Film Academy unanimously elected her President of the Academy, replacing Agnieszka Holland, the Polish director, who decided to devote her time to filmmaking.

On February 4 2025, Binoche was named as jury president for that year&#x27;s Cannes Film Festival. 

==Personal life==
Binoche has two children: son Raphaël (born on 2 September 1993), whose father is André Halle, a professional scuba diver, and daughter Hana (born on 16 December 1999), whose father is actor Benoît Magimel, with whom Binoche starred in the 1999 film &quot;Children of the Century&quot; and the 2023 film &quot;The Taste of Things&quot;. Her sister, Marion Stalens, born 1960, is a professional photographer with Corbis, as well as a director of documentary films, including: &quot;La réconciliation?&quot;, a documentary shot on the set of John Boorman&#x27;s film &quot;In My Country&quot;; &quot;The Actress and the Dancer&quot;, which explores the genesis of Binoche&#x27;s dance show &quot;In-I&quot;; and &quot;Juliette Binoche – Sketches for a Portrait&quot;, a documentary which follows Binoche as she paints the portraits that would later appear in her book &quot;Portraits in Eyes&quot;. Marion is married to stage director Pierre Pradinas.

Her half-brother Camille Humeau (born 1978) is a musician and has been part of the line-up of Oncle Strongle, before top-lining the group Artichaut Orkestra. In 2007, he appeared in a stage production of &quot;Cabaret&quot; directed by Sam Mendes.

===Charitable work===
Since 1992, Binoche has been a patron of the French Cambodian charity &quot;Enfants d&#x27;Asie&quot; (previously ASPECA). Through this charity, she is godmother to five Cambodian orphans, and has funded the construction of a children&#x27;s home in Battambang. Starting in 2000, she has been involved with the organization Reporters Without Borders. In 2002, she presided over &quot;Photos of Stars&quot; with Thierry Ardisson. Nearly 100 French stars were given disposable cameras, which were then auctioned, the buyer then having the exclusive photos taken by the star developed.

===Political views and activism===
On 7 February 2006, Binoche attended a high-profile demonstration organized by Reporters Without Borders in support of Jill Carroll and two Iraqi journalists who had been abducted in Baghdad.

She supported José Bové in the 2007 French presidential election, which was won by Nicolas Sarkozy. She disclosed on a number of occasions that she did not approve of the Sarkozy administration, stating that he was creating a monarchic republic.

In 2009, she commented on the September 11 attacks during the shooting of &quot;Quelques jours en septembre&quot;, a spy film in which interest groups, including the American secret services, were aware of an imminent attack on the United States. She talked with a secret agent, who was a consultant for the film, and was reported in an English newspaper saying: &quot;He couldn&#x27;t tell me everything, but he told me a lot. I was surprised by some things.&quot;

Binoche and numerous other French personalities, including Isabelle Adjani, Yvan Attal, Jane Birkin, and Josiane Balasko, joined Réseau Éducation Sans Frontières (RESF) on 7 January 2010 with a symbolic &quot;cake of solidarity&quot; to highlight the taxation and legitimacy issues being faced by undocumented workers in France.

Binoche was a signatory to a June 2010 petition organized by Reporters Without Borders and Shirin Ebadi to protest against the detention of numerous people, including members of the press, who were protesting the occasion of the first anniversary of the disputed re-election of Iran&#x27;s president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

At the 2010 Cannes Film Festival, Binoche spoke out against the detention of Iranian director Jafar Panahi, incarcerated in Tehran&#x27;s Evin Prison since 1 March 2010 without charge or conviction. At the press conference following the press screening of &quot;Copie Conforme&quot;, Binoche was informed that Panahi had begun a hunger strike. The following day, Binoche attended a press conference called especially to demand the release of Panahi. Also in attendance were Abbas Kiarostami, Mohsen Makhmalbaf, and Gilles Jacob. Binoche read a letter that said that Panahi&#x27;s detention was &quot;unwarranted and intolerable&quot;. When Binoche was awarded the Best Actress award at the festival, brandishing his name on a placard, she used her speech as an opportunity to raise Panahi&#x27;s plight once again. On 25 May, it was announced that Panahi had been released on bail. It was generally agreed that the publicity Binoche and Kiarostami elicited for his case was a strong factor in his release. On 20 December 2010, Panahi, after being prosecuted for &quot;assembly and colluding with the intention to commit crimes against the country&#x27;s national security and propaganda against the Islamic Republic&quot;, was handed a six-year jail sentence and a 20-year ban on making or directing any movies, writing screenplays, giving any form of interview with Iranian or foreign media, as well as leaving the country. Binoche continued to lobby on his behalf.

In May 2018, she co-authored a tribune in the newspaper &quot;Le Monde&quot;, in which she opposed the lawsuit brought by the French judiciary to three people who had helped migrants, and said she had already helped migrants in need and intended to continue to do so.

In 2018 she signed a letter calling to act “firmly and immediately” for stopping climate change and biodiversity loss.

In February 2019, during a press conference at the Berlin International Film Festival, Binoche said that Harvey Weinstein was a great producer and &quot;we shouldn&#x27;t forget, even though it has been difficult for some directors and actors, and especially actresses&quot;. Binoche also said: &quot;I almost want to say peace to his mind and heart, that&#x27;s all, I&#x27;m trying to put my feet in his shoes. He&#x27;s had enough, I think. A lot of people have expressed themselves. Now justice has to do its work.&quot;

<text>A juggernaut (), in current English usage, is a literal or metaphorical force regarded as merciless, destructive, and unstoppable.

This English usage originates in the mid-nineteenth century. &quot;Juggernaut&quot; is the early rendering in English of Jagannath, an important deity in the Hindu traditions of eastern and north-eastern India. The meaning originates from the Hindu temple cars, which are chariots, often huge, used in processions or religious parades for Jagannath and other deities, the largest of which, once set into motion, are difficult to stop, steer or control by humans, on account of their massive weight.

Since the Middle Ages, Europeans had been fascinated by accounts of the &quot;Ratha Yatra&quot; ( ) at Puri, which claimed that pilgrims threw themselves under the temple cars. However, by 1825 it was said: &quot;That excess of fanaticism which formerly prompted the pilgrims to court death by throwing themselves in crowds under the wheels of the car of Jaganath, has happily long ceased&quot;. Despite this, a New York Times report from 1864 reported witnessing celebrants deliberately placing themselves under the wheels of the device against the will of the authorities. 

==Overview==
The figurative use of the word is analogous to figurative uses of steamroller or battering ram to mean something overwhelming. Its ground in social behavior is similar to that of bandwagon, but with overtones of devotional sacrifice. Its British English meaning of a large heavy truck or articulated lorry dates from the second half of the twentieth century.

The word is derived from the Sanskrit/Odia (Devanagari , Odia ) &quot;world-lord&quot;, combining (&quot;world&quot;) and (&quot;lord&quot;), which is one of the names of Krishna found in the Sanskrit epics.

The English loanword &quot;juggernaut&quot; in the sense of &quot;a huge wagon bearing an image of a Hindu god&quot; is from the seventeenth century, inspired by the Jagannatha Temple in Puri, Odisha (Orissa), which has the &quot;Ratha Yatra&quot; (&quot;Temple car procession&quot;), an annual procession of chariots carrying the &quot;murtis&quot; (images) of &quot;Jagannātha&quot;, Subhadra, and Balabhadra. 

The first European description of this festival is found in a thirteenth-century account by the Late Medieval Franciscan friar and missionary Odoric of Pordenone, who describes Hindus, as a religious sacrifice, casting themselves under the wheels of these huge chariots and being crushed to death. Odoric&#x27;s description was later taken up and elaborated upon in the popular fourteenth-century &quot;Travels of John Mandeville&quot;. Others have suggested more prosaically that the deaths, if any, were accidental and caused by the press of the crowd and the general commotion. Contemporaneous reports from colonial Kolkata report witnessing intentional suicides at the processions which were either tacitly allowed or else ignored by clerics, despite the practice being prohibited by government policy. 

Many speakers and writers apply the term to a large machine, or collectively to a team or group of people working together (such as a highly successful sports team or corporation), or even a growing political movement led by a charismatic leader—and it often bears an association with being crushingly destructive towards all obstacles.

== In popular culture ==
The figurative sense of the English word juggernaut, as a merciless, destructive, and unstoppable force, became common in the mid-nineteenth century. Mary Shelley used the term in her novel &quot;The Last Man&quot;, published in 1826, to describe the plague: &quot;like Juggernaut, she proceeds crushing out the being of all who strew the high road of life&quot;. Charles Dickens used the term in &quot;The Life and Adventures of Martin Chuzzlewit&quot;, published in 1844, to describe the love-lorn sentiments of Mr. Augustus Moddle, the &#x27;youngest gentleman&#x27; at Mrs. Todgers&#x27;s: &quot;He often informed Mrs. Todgers that the sun had set upon him; that the billows had rolled over him; that the Car of Juggernaut had crushed him; and also that the deadly Upass tree of Java had blighted him.&quot; Robert Louis Stevenson used the term in &quot;Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde&quot;, published in 1886, when describing the violent Edward Hyde as &quot;like some damned Juggernaut&quot; after he trampled a child.

Other notable writers to have used the word this way range from H. G. Wells and Longfellow to Joe Klein. Bill Wilson in &quot;Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions&quot; of Alcoholics Anonymous describes &quot;self-sufficiency&quot; in society at large as being a &quot;bone-crushing juggernaut whose final achievement is ruin&quot;. To the contrary, Mark Twain (autobiography, vol 2), describes Juggernaut as the kindest of gods. Any pretensions to rank or caste do not exist within its temple.

Juggernaut (Cain Marko) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Stan Lee and artist/co-writer Jack Kirby, he first appeared in &quot;X-Men&quot; #12 (July 1965) as an adversary of the eponymous superhero team. He possesses superhuman strength and durability, and is virtually immune to most physical attacks; his helmet also protects him from mental attacks.

In the future wars depicted in John Shirley&#x27;s &quot;Eclipse Trilogy&quot;, the contending armies use &quot;Jaegernauts&quot; — large rolling war machines that can destroy entire city blocks, high rises and other large buildings.

The Odisha Juggernauts are a sports team in the Indian Ultimate Kho Kho league.

<text>The Treaty of Passarowitz, or Treaty of Požarevac, was the peace treaty signed in Požarevac (, , ), a town that was in the Ottoman Empire but is now in Serbia, on 21 July 1718 between the Ottoman Empire and its adversaries, the Habsburg monarchy and the Republic of Venice.

The treaty saw the cession of several Ottoman territories to the Habsburgs, and it was regarded in its time as an extraordinary success and source of pride in Vienna. The treaty marked the end of Ottoman occupation within the Kingdom of Hungary with the cession of Belgrade, Syrmia and the Eyalet of Temesvár.

==Background==
Between 1714 and 1718, the Ottomans had been successful against Venice in Ottoman Greece and Crete (Ottoman–Venetian War) but had been defeated at Petrovaradin (1716) by the Habsburg troops of Prince Eugene of Savoy (Austro-Turkish War of 1716–1718).

Peace was arranged with the intervention of Great Britain and the Dutch Republic, and the treaty was signed by Sir Robert Sutton and Jacob Colyer on behalf of their governments.

The other signatories were 
*Damian Hugo, Count of Virmont and Michael von Talmann for the Habsburg monarchy, 
*Vendramino Bianchi and Carlo Ruzzini for Venice 
*Silindar Ibrahim–aga and Mehmed–efendija for the Ottoman Empire. 

==Terms==
The Ottoman Empire lost the Banat of Temeswar, western Wallachia, northern Serbia (including the fortress town of Belgrade), and northern part of Bosnia, namely the region of Posavina to the Habsburgs. The Habsburgs also received assurances that their merchants could operate in the Ottoman domain and that Catholic priests would regain revoked privileges, which allowed the Habsburg emperor to interfere in Ottoman affairs through connections with the church community and by championing the Catholic faith.

Venice ceded the Morea, its last remaining outposts in Crete, and the islands of Aegina and Tinos. Venice retained only the Ionian Islands (with Ottoman-occupied Kythira added to them), and the cities of Preveza and Arta on the Epirote mainland. In Dalmatia, Venice made some small advances by taking the areas of Imotski and Vrgorac in the Hinterland.

==Aftermath==
The treaty gave the Habsburgs control over the northern part of present-day Serbia, which they had temporarily occupied during the Great Turkish War between 1688 and 1690. The Habsburgs established the Kingdom of Serbia as a crown land. The Habsburgs also formed the Banat into another crown land.

Habsburg control lasted 21 years, when the Turks won the Austro-Russian–Turkish War (1735–39). In the 1739 Treaty of Belgrade, the Ottoman Empire regained northern Bosnia, Habsburg Serbia (including Belgrade) and southern parts of the Banat of Temeswar, and Oltenia was returned to Wallachia.
