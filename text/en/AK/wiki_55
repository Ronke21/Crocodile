<text>A fast-food restaurant, also known as a quick-service restaurant (QSR) within the industry, is a specific type of restaurant that serves fast-food cuisine and has minimal table service. The food served in fast-food restaurants is typically part of a &quot;meat-sweet diet&quot;, offered from a limited menu, cooked in bulk in advance and kept hot, finished and packaged to order, and usually available for take away, though seating may be provided. Fast-food restaurants are typically part of a restaurant chain or franchise operation that provides standardized ingredients and/or partially prepared foods and supplies to each restaurant through controlled supply channels. The term &quot;fast food&quot; was recognized in a dictionary by Merriam–Webster in 1951.

While the first fast-food restaurant in the United States was a White Castle in 1921, fast-food restaurants had been operating elsewhere much earlier, such as the Japanese fast food company Yoshinoya, started in Tokyo in 1899. Today, American-founded fast-food chains such as McDonald&#x27;s ( 1940) and KFC (est. 1952) are multinational corporations with outlets across the globe.

Variations on the fast-food restaurant concept include fast-casual restaurants and catering trucks. Fast-casual restaurants have higher sit-in ratios, offering a hybrid between counter-service typical at fast-food restaurants and a traditional table service restaurant. Catering trucks (also called food trucks) often park just outside worksites and are popular with factory workers.

==History==
In 1896, the first self-service restaurant (the &quot;Stollwerck-Automatenrestaurant&quot;) opened in Berlin&#x27;s Leipziger Straße.

===United States===

Some trace the modern history of fast food in the United States to 7 July 1912, with the opening of a fast-food restaurant called the Automat in New York. The Automat was a cafeteria with its prepared foods behind small glass windows and coin-operated slots. Joseph Horn and Frank Hardart had already opened the first Horn &amp; Hardart Automat in Philadelphia in 1902, but their &quot;Automat&quot; at Broadway and 13th Street, in New York City, created a sensation. Numerous Automat restaurants were built around the country to deal with the demand. Automats remained extremely popular throughout the 1920s and 1930s. The company also popularized the notion of &quot;take-out&quot; food, with their slogan &quot;Less work for Mother&quot;.

Most historians agree that the American company White Castle was the first fast-food outlet, starting in Wichita, Kansas in 1916 with food stands and founding in 1921, selling hamburgers for five cents apiece from its inception and spawning numerous competitors and emulators. What is certain, however, is that White Castle made the first significant effort to standardize the food production in, look of, and operation of fast-food hamburger restaurants. William Ingram&#x27;s and Walter Anderson&#x27;s White Castle System created the first fast-food supply chain to provide meat, buns, paper goods, and other supplies to their restaurants, pioneered the concept of the multi-state hamburger restaurant chain, standardized the look and construction of the restaurants themselves, and even developed a construction division that manufactured and built the chain&#x27;s prefabricated restaurant buildings. The McDonald&#x27;s Speedee Service System and, much later, Ray Kroc&#x27;s McDonald&#x27;s outlets and Hamburger University all built on principles, systems and practices that White Castle had already established between 1923 and 1932.

The hamburger restaurant most associated by the public with the term &quot;fast food&quot; was created by two brothers originally from Nashua, New Hampshire. Richard and Maurice McDonald opened a barbecue drive-in in 1940 in the city of San Bernardino, California. After discovering that most of their profits came from hamburgers, the brothers closed their restaurant for three months and reopened it in 1948 as a walk-up stand offering a simple menu of hamburgers, french fries, shakes, coffee, and Coca-Cola, served in disposable paper wrapping. As a result, they could produce hamburgers and fries constantly, without waiting for customer orders, and could serve them immediately; hamburgers cost 15 cents, about half the price at a typical diner. Their streamlined production method, which they named the &quot;Speedee Service System&quot; was influenced by the production line innovations of Henry Ford.

By 1954, The McDonald brothers&#x27; stand was restaurant equipment manufacturer Prince Castle&#x27;s biggest purchaser of milkshake blending machines. Prince Castle salesman Ray Kroc traveled to California to discover why the company had purchased almost a dozen of the units as opposed to the normal one or two found in most restaurants of the time. Enticed by the success of the McDonald&#x27;s concept, Kroc signed a franchise agreement with the brothers and began opening McDonald&#x27;s restaurants in Illinois. By 1961, Kroc had bought out the brothers and created what is now the modern McDonald&#x27;s Corporation. One of the major parts of his business plan was to promote cleanliness of his restaurants to growing groups of Americans that had become aware of food safety issues. As part of his commitment to cleanliness, Kroc often took part in cleaning his own Des Plaines, Illinois outlet by hosing down the garbage cans and scraping gum off the cement. Another concept Kroc added was great swaths of glass which enabled the customer to view the food preparation, a practice still found in chains such as Krispy Kreme. A clean atmosphere was only part of Kroc&#x27;s grander plan which separated McDonald&#x27;s from the rest of the competition and attributes to their great success. Kroc envisioned making his restaurants appeal to suburban families.

At roughly the same time as Kroc was conceiving what eventually became McDonald&#x27;s Corporation, two Miami, Florida businessmen, James McLamore and David Edgerton, opened a franchise of the predecessor to what is now the international fast-food restaurant chain Burger King. McLamore had visited the original McDonald&#x27;s hamburger stand belonging to the McDonald brothers; sensing potential in their innovative assembly line–based production system, he decided he wanted to open a similar operation of his own. The two partners eventually decided to invest their money in Jacksonville, Florida-based Insta-Burger King. Originally opened in 1953, the founders and owners of the chain, Keith G. Cramer and his wife&#x27;s uncle Matthew Burns, opened their first stores around a piece of equipment known as the Insta-Broiler. The Insta-Broiler oven proved so successful at cooking burgers, they required all of their franchises to carry the device. By 1959 McLamore and Edgarton were operating several locations within the Miami-Dade area and were growing at a fast clip. Despite the success of their operation, the partners discovered that the design of the insta-broiler made the unit&#x27;s heating elements prone to degradation from the drippings of the beef patties. The pair eventually created a mechanized gas grill that avoided the problems by changing the way the meat patties were cooked in the unit. After the original company began to falter in 1959, it was purchased by McLamore and Edgerton who renamed the company Burger King.

While fast-food restaurants usually have a seating area in which customers can eat the food on the premises, orders are designed to be taken away, and traditional table service is rare. Orders are generally taken and paid for at a wide counter, with the customer waiting by the counter for a tray or container for their food. A &quot;drive-through&quot; service can allow customers to order and pick up food from their cars.

Nearly from its inception, fast food has been designed to be eaten &quot;on the go&quot; and often does not require traditional cutlery and is eaten as a finger food. Common menu items at fast-food outlets include fish and chips, sandwiches, pitas, hamburgers, fried chicken, french fries, chicken nuggets, tacos, pizza, and ice cream, although many fast-food restaurants offer &quot;slower&quot; foods like chili, mashed potatoes, and salads.

==Cuisine==
Modern commercial fast food is highly processed and prepared on a large scale from bulk ingredients using standardized cooking and production methods and equipment. It is usually rapidly served in cartons, bags, or in a plastic wrapping, in a fashion which reduces operating costs by allowing rapid product identification and counting, promoting longer holding time, avoiding transfer of bacteria, and facilitating order fulfillment. In most fast-food operations, menu items are generally made from processed ingredients prepared at central supply facilities and then shipped to individual outlets where they are cooked (usually by grill, microwave, or deep-frying) or assembled in a short amount of time either in anticipation of upcoming orders (i.e., &quot;to stock&quot;) or in response to actual orders (i.e., &quot;to order&quot;). Following standard operating procedures, pre-cooked products are monitored for freshness and disposed of if holding times become excessive. This process ensures a consistent level of product quality, and is key to delivering the order quickly to the customer and avoiding labor and equipment costs in the individual stores.

Because of commercial emphasis on taste, speed, product safety, uniformity, and low cost, fast-food products are made with ingredients formulated to achieve an identifiable flavor, aroma, texture, and &quot;mouth feel&quot; and to preserve freshness and control handling costs during preparation and order fulfillment. This requires a high degree of food engineering. The use of additives, including salt, sugar, flavorings and preservatives, and processing techniques may limit the nutritional value of the final product.

===Value meals===
A &quot;value meal&quot; is a group of menu items offered together at a lower price than they would cost individually. A hamburger, side of fries, and drink commonly constitute a value meal—or &quot;combo&quot; depending on the chain. Value meals at fast-food restaurants are common as a merchandising tactic to facilitate bundling, up-selling, and price discrimination. Most of the time they can be upgraded to a larger side and drink for a small fee. The perceived creation of a &quot;discount&quot; on individual menu items in exchange for the purchase of a &quot;meal&quot; is also consistent with the loyalty marketing school of thought.

==Technology==
Early fast-food production relied on manual, physical methods of tracking orders, such as order wheels.

To make quick service possible and to ensure accuracy and security, many fast-food restaurants have incorporated hospitality point of sale systems. This makes it possible for kitchen crew people to view orders placed at the front counter or drive through in real time. Wireless systems allow orders placed at drive through speakers to be taken by cashiers and cooks. Drive through and walk through configurations will allow orders to be taken at one register and paid at another. Modern point of sale systems can operate on computer networks using a variety of software programs. Sales records can be generated and remote access to computer reports can be given to corporate offices, managers, troubleshooters, and other authorized personnel.

Food service chains partner with food equipment manufacturers to design highly specialized restaurant equipment, often incorporating heat sensors, timers, and other electronic controls into the design. Collaborative design techniques, such as rapid visualization and computer-aided design of restaurant kitchens are now being used to establish equipment specifications that are consistent with restaurant operating and merchandising requirements.

==Business==


===Consumer spending===
In the United States, consumers spent about $110 billion on fast food in 2000 (which increased from $6 billion in 1970). The National Restaurant Association forecasts that fast-food restaurants in the US will reach $142 billion in sales in 2006, a 5% increase over 2005. In comparison, the full-service restaurant segment of the food industry is expected to generate $173 billion in sales. Fast food has been losing market share to so-called fast-casual restaurants, which offer more robust and expensive cuisines.

===Major international brands===
McDonald&#x27;s, a fast-food supplier, opened its first franchised restaurant in the US in 1955 (1974 in the UK). It has become a phenomenally successful enterprise in terms of financial growth, brand-name recognition, and worldwide expansion. Ray Kroc, who bought the franchising license from the McDonald brothers, pioneered concepts which emphasized standardization. He introduced uniform products, identical in all respects at each outlet, to increase sales. Kroc also insisted on cutting food costs as much as possible, eventually using the McDonald&#x27;s Corporation&#x27;s size to force suppliers to conform to this ethos.

Other prominent international fast-food companies include Burger King, the number two hamburger chain in the world, known for promoting its customized menu offerings (&quot;Have it Your Way&quot;). Another international fast-food chain is KFC, which sells chicken-related products and is the number 1 fast-food company in the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

===Franchising===
A fast-food chain restaurant is generally owned either by the parent company of the fast-food chain or a franchisee – an independent party given the right to use the company&#x27;s trademark and trade name. In the latter case, a contract is made between the franchisee and the parent company, typically requiring the franchisee to pay an initial, fixed fee in addition to a continual percentage of monthly sales. Upon opening for business, the franchisee oversees the day-to-day operations of the restaurant and acts as a manager of the store. Once the contract expires, the parent company may choose to &quot;renew the contract, sell the franchise to another franchisee, or operate the restaurant itself.&quot; In most fast-food chains, the number of franchised locations exceeds the number of company owned locations.

Fast-food chains rely on consistency and uniformity, in internal operations and brand image, across all of their restaurant locations in order to convey a sense of reliability to their customers. This sense of reliability coupled with a positive customer experience brings customers to place trust in the company. This sense of trust leads to increased customer loyalty which gives the company a source of recurring business. When a person is presented with a choice of different restaurants to eat at, it is much easier for them to stick with what they know, rather than to take a gamble and dive into the unknown.

Due to the importance of consistency, most companies set standards unifying their various restaurant locations with a set of common rules and regulations. Parent companies often rely on field representatives to ensure that the practices of franchised locations are consistent with the company&#x27;s standards. However, the more locations a fast-food chain has, the harder it is for the parent company to guarantee that these standards are being followed. Moreover, it is much more expensive to discharge a franchisee for noncompliance with company standards, than it is to discharge an employee for that same reason. As a consequence, parent companies tend to deal with franchisee violations in a more relaxed manner.

Many companies also adapt to their different local areas to support the needs of the customers. Sometimes it is necessary for a franchisee to modify the way the restaurant/store runs to meet the needs of local customers. As referenced in Bodey&#x27;s &quot;Localization and Customer Retention for Franchise Service Systems&quot; article, J. L. Bradach claims that a franchise will either use the tactical or strategic local response. Tactical applies to accounting for hiring of personnel and suppliers as well as financial decisions to adapt to the local customers. Strategic applies to the specific characteristics of the franchise that will change from the basic format followed by all to fit in the local area.

For the most part, someone visiting a McDonald&#x27;s in the United States will have the same experience as someone visiting a McDonald&#x27;s in Japan. The interior design, the menu, the speed of service, and the taste of the food will all be very similar. However, some differences do exist to tailor to particular cultural differences. For example, in October 2005 during a midst of plummeting sales in Japan, McDonald&#x27;s added a shrimp burger to the Japanese menu. The choice to introduce a shrimp burger was no coincidence, as a 1989 study stated that world consumption of shrimp was &quot;led by Japan.&quot;

In March 2010, Taco Bell opened their first restaurant in India. Because non-consumption of beef is a cultural norm in light of India&#x27;s Dharmic beliefs, Taco Bell had to tailor its menu to the dietary distinctions of Indian culture by replacing all of the beef with chicken. By the same token, completely meatless options were introduced to the menu due to the prevalence of vegetarianism throughout the country.

== Countries ==

Multinational corporations typically modify their menus to cater to local tastes, and most overseas outlets are owned by native franchisees. McDonald&#x27;s in India, for example, uses chicken and paneer rather than beef and pork in their burgers because Hinduism traditionally forbids eating beef. In Israel some McDonald&#x27;s restaurants are kosher and respect the Jewish Shabbat; there is also a kosher McDonald&#x27;s in Argentina. In Egypt, Indonesia, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Pakistan, and Singapore, all menu items are halal.

===North America===

Many fast-food operations have more local and regional roots, such as White Castle in the Midwest United States, along with Hardee&#x27;s (owned by CKE Restaurants, which also owns Carl&#x27;s Jr., whose locations are primarily on the United States West Coast); Krystal, Bojangles&#x27; Famous Chicken &#x27;n Biscuits, Cook Out, and Zaxby&#x27;s restaurants in the American Southeast; Raising Cane&#x27;s in Louisiana and other mostly Southern states; Hot &#x27;n Now in Michigan and Wisconsin; In-N-Out Burger (in California, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, and Texas, with a few locations in Oregon) and Original Tommy&#x27;s chains in Southern California; Dick&#x27;s Drive-In in Seattle, Washington and Arctic Circle in Utah and other western states; Halo Burger around Flint, Michigan and Burgerville in the Portland, Oregon area. Also, Whataburger is a popular burger chain in the American South, and Jack in the Box is located in the West and South. Canada pizza chains Topper&#x27;s Pizza and Pizza Pizza are primarily located in Ontario. Coffee chain Country Style operates only in Ontario, and competes with the famous coffee and donut chain Tim Hortons. Maid-Rite restaurant is one of the oldest chain fast-food restaurants in the United States. Founded in 1926, their specialty is a loose meat hamburger. Maid-Rites can be found in the midwest - mainly Iowa, Minnesota, Illinois, and Missouri.

International brands dominant in North America include McDonald&#x27;s, Burger King and Wendy&#x27;s, the number three burger chain in the USA; Dunkin&#x27; Donuts, a New England–based chain; automobile oriented Sonic Drive-In&#x27;s from Oklahoma City; Starbucks, Seattle-born coffee-based fast-food beverage corporation; KFC and Taco Bell, which are both part of the largest restaurant conglomerate in the world, Yum! Brands; and Domino&#x27;s Pizza, a pizza chain known for popularizing home delivery of fast food.

Subway is known for their sub sandwiches and are the largest restaurant chain to serve such food items. Quiznos a Denver-based sub shop is another fast-growing sub chain, yet with over 6,000 locations it is still far behind Subway&#x27;s 34,000 locations. Other smaller sub shops include Blimpie, Jersey Mike&#x27;s Subs, Mr. Goodcents, Jimmy John&#x27;s, Potbelly Sandwich Shop, Penn Station, and Firehouse.

A&amp;W Restaurants was originally a United States and Canada fast-food brand, but it is currently an International fast-food corporation in several countries.

In Canada the majority of fast-food chains are American owned or were originally American owned but have since set up a Canadian management/headquarters locations such as Panera Bread, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Five Guys, and Carl&#x27;s Jr. Although the case is usually American fast-food chains expanding into Canada, Canadian chains such as Tim Hortons have expanded into 22 states in the United States, but are more prominent in border states such as New York and Michigan. Tim Hortons has started to expand to other countries outside of North America. The Pita Pit franchise originated in Canada and has expanded to the United States and other Countries. The Canadian Extreme Pita franchise sells low fat and salt pita sandwiches with stores in the larger Canadian cities. Other Canadian fast-food chains such as Manchu Wok serve North American style Asian foods; this company is located mainly in Canada and the US, with other outlets on US military bases on other continents. Harvey&#x27;s is a Canadian-only burger restaurant chain, present in every province.

=== Oceania ===

====Australia====
Australia&#x27;s fast-food market began in the late 1960s and early 1970s, with the opening of several American franchises including KFC (1967),Pizza Hut (1970), and McDonald&#x27;s (1971), followed by Burger King. However, the Burger King market found that this name was already a registered trademark to a takeaway food shop in Adelaide. Thus, the Burger King Australian market was forced to pick another name, selecting the Hungry Jack&#x27;s brand name. Prior to this, the Australian fast-food market consisted primarily of privately owned take-away shops.

====New Zealand====
In New Zealand, the fast-food market began in the 1970s with KFC (opened 1971), Pizza Hut (1974), and McDonald&#x27;s (1976), and all three remain popular today. Burger King and Domino&#x27;s entered the market later in the 1990s. Australian pizza chains Eagle Boys and Pizza Haven also entered the market in the 1990s, but their New Zealand operations were later sold to Pizza Hut and Domino&#x27;s.

A few fast-food chains have been founded in New Zealand, including Burger Fuel (founded 1995), Georgie Pie (founded 1977, but closed 1998 after falling into financial trouble and being bought out by McDonald&#x27;s) and Hell Pizza (founded 1996).

=== Europe ===
====United Kingdom====
The United Kingdom&#x27;s signature type of fast-food restaurant is a fish and chip shop, which specializes in fish and chips and also other foods such as kebabs and burgers. Fish and chip shops are usually owned independently.

Burger brands like Wimpy remain, although the majority of branches became Burger King in 1989.

====Netherlands====

In the Netherlands, walk-up fast-food restaurants with &quot;automatiek&quot;, a typical Dutch vending machine, are found throughout the country, most notably in Amsterdam. In this automatic format, a counter is available for purchasing French fries, beverages, krokets, frikandellen, kaassoufflés and hamburgers and other snacks can be bought from the automats. FEBO is one of the largest of such types of fast-food restaurants with automats.

====Ireland====
In addition to home-grown chains such as Supermac&#x27;s, numerous American chains such as McDonald&#x27;s and Burger King have also established a presence in Ireland. In 2015, a study developed by Treated.com was published in the Irish Times, which named Swords in County Dublin as Ireland&#x27;s &#x27;fast-food capital&#x27;.

====Czech Republic====
Bageterie Boulevard is a Czech fast food chain, headquartered in Prague, which began in 2003 with the opening of its first location in the Dejvice district. Today, the brand operates numerous restaurants in both the Czech Republic and Slovakia.

=== Asia ===

====Japan====
American chains such as Domino&#x27;s Pizza, McDonald&#x27;s, Pizza Hut, and KFC have a big presence in Japan, but local gyudon chains such as Sukiya, Matsuya and Yoshinoya also blanket the country. Japan has its own burger chains including MOS Burger, Lotteria and Freshness Burger.
====Taiwan====
Notable Taiwanese fast-food restaurants include 85C Bakery Cafe, TKK Fried Chicken, and Bafang Dumpling.

====India====
The major fast-food chains in India that serve American fast food are KFC, McDonald&#x27;s, Starbucks, Burger King, Subway, Pizza Hut, and Dominos. Most of these have had to make a lot of changes to their standard menus to cater to Indian food habits and taste preferences. Some emerging Indian food chains include Wow! Momo, Haldiram&#x27;s, Faaso&#x27;s and Café Coffee Day.

Food habits vary widely across states within India. While typical idli and dosa is fast food in Southern India, in Maharashtra it is misal-pav, pav-bhaji, and poha. Further north in Punjab and Haryana, chole-bhature are very popular and in Bihar and Jharkhand litti-chokha is their staple fast food.

====Pakistan====
Fast food In Pakistan varies. There are many international chains serving fast food, including Nandos, Burger King, KFC, McDonald&#x27;s, Domino&#x27;s Pizza, Fatburger, Dunkin&#x27; Donuts, Subway, Pizza Hut, Hardee&#x27;s, Telepizza, Steak Escape and Gloria Jean&#x27;s Coffees. In addition to the international chains, in local cuisine people in Pakistan like to have biryani, bun kebabs, Nihari, kebab rolls etc. as fast food.

====Philippines====

In the Philippines, fast-food is the same as in the US. However, the only difference is that they serve Filipino dishes and a few American products being served Filipino-style. Jollibee is the leading fast-food chain in the country with 1,000 stores nationwide.

Saudi Arabia has many international fast-food chains including KFC, Burger King, McDonald&#x27;s and many others. However, the most popular fast-food restaurant of Saudi Arabia is Albaik. Saudis regard Albaik as better than KFC.

====Hong Kong====

In Hong Kong, although McDonald&#x27;s and KFC are quite popular, three major local fast-food chains provide Hong Kong-style fast food, namely Café de Coral, Fairwood, and Maxim MX. Café de Coral alone serves more than 300,000 customers daily. Unlike western fast-food chains, these restaurants offer four different menus at different times of the day, namely breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea, and dinner. &quot;Siu mei&quot; is offered throughout the day.

&quot;Dai pai dong&quot; and traditional Hong Kong street food may be considered close relatives of the conventional fast-food outlet.

====Israel====
In Israel, local burger chain Burger Ranch is popular as are McDonald&#x27;s and Burger King. Domino&#x27;s Pizza is also a popular fast-food restaurant. Chains like McDonald&#x27;s offer kosher branches. Intrinsically non-kosher foods such as cheeseburgers are rare in Israeli fast-food chains, even in non-kosher branches. There are many small local fast-food chains that serve pizza, hamburgers, sushi and local foods such as hummus, falafel and shawarma.

=== Africa ===

McDonald&#x27;s, Subway and Pizza Hut have a significant presence within South Africa.

==Trends==

===Health concerns===
Some of the large fast-food chains are beginning to incorporate healthier alternatives in their menu, e.g., white meat, snack wraps, salads, and fresh fruit. However, some people see these moves as a tokenistic and commercial measure, rather than an appropriate reaction to ethical concerns about the world ecology and people&#x27;s health. McDonald&#x27;s announced that in March 2006, the chain would include nutritional information on the packaging of all of its products.

In September and October 2000, during the Starlink corn recalls, up to $50 million worth of corn-based foods were recalled from restaurants as well as supermarkets. The products contained Starlink genetically modified corn that was not approved for human consumption. It was the first-ever recall of a genetically modified food. The environmental group Friends of the Earth that had first detected the contaminated shells was critical of the FDA for not doing its own job.

Fast food is commonly blamed for the obesity epidemic in the United States today. 60% of Americans today are either overweight or obese. With obesity especially being seen among children, places like McDonald&#x27;s and other fast-food restaurants take the majority of the blame. 34% of children and adolescents consume fast food on any given day, while 80% of children claim that McDonald&#x27;s is their favorite place to eat at. The number of children and adolescents as well as adults eating out every day is only seen to progress and rise. Research concludes that children and adolescents ranging from twelve to nineteen years old consume twice as many calories from fast-food restaurants than children ranging from two to eleven years old.

The FDA found that trans fats raises the amount of cholesterol in blood, which raises the chance of developing heart disease which is known as one of the leading causes of death in the U.S. In a recent study, it was found that 11 out of 25 restaurants failed after tests on the use of antibiotics as well. Antibiotic-resistant infections affect at least 2 million Americans each year, which will leave at least 23,000 of those people to die.

===Consumer appeal===
Fast-food outlets have become popular with consumers for several reasons. One is that through economies of scale in purchasing and producing food, these companies can deliver food to consumers at a very low cost. In addition, although some people dislike fast food for its predictability, it can be reassuring to a hungry person in a hurry or far from home. At the same time, standardized service processes ensure a consistent experience across locations, which is attractive to consumers.

In the post-World War II period in the United States, fast-food chains like McDonald&#x27;s rapidly gained a reputation for their cleanliness, fast service, and a child-friendly atmosphere where families on the road could grab a quick meal. Prior to the rise of the fast-food chain restaurant, people generally had a choice between diners where the quality of the food was often questionable and service lacking, or high-end restaurants that were expensive and impractical for families with children. The modern, stream-lined convenience of the fast-food restaurant provided a new alternative and appealed to Americans&#x27; instinct for ideas and products associated with progress, technology, and innovation. Fast-food restaurants rapidly became the eatery &quot;everyone could agree on&quot;, with many featuring child-size menu combos, play areas, and whimsical branding campaigns, like the iconic Ronald McDonald, designed to appeal to younger customers. Parents could have a few minutes of peace while children played or amused themselves with the toys included in their Happy Meal. There is a long history of fast-food advertising campaigns, many of which are directed at children.

Fast-food marketing largely focuses on children and teenagers. Popular methods of advertising include television, product placement in toys, games, educational materials, songs, and movies, character licensing and celebrity endorsements, and websites. Advertisements targeting children mainly focus on free toys, movie tie-ins and other giveaways. Fast-food restaurants use kid&#x27;s meals with toys, kid friendly mascots, vibrant colors, and play areas to draw children toward their products. . Children&#x27;s power over their parents&#x27; purchases is estimated to total $300 to $500 billion every year. Fast food has become a part of American culture as a reward for children. To deny a child &quot;desirable things&quot; such as the advertised fast-food restaurant can cause stigmatization of parents as the &quot;mean parent&quot; when it is common among other parents to comply with their child&#x27;s desires.

The major focus on children by the fast-food industry has created controversy due to the rising issue of child obesity in America. As a result of this focus, in 2008 a coalition was created and run by the Council of Better Business Bureaus called Children&#x27;s Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative(CFBAI), to stop ads aimed at children or to promote only what the council dubs &quot;better-for- you&quot; products in ads directed towards children. However, it was not until 2011 that Congress requested guidelines be put in place by the CFBAI, FDA, Agriculture Department, and Centers for Disease Control. There are two basic requirements identified in the guidelines for foods that are advertised for children: (1) The food has to include healthful ingredients; (2) The food can&#x27;t contain unhealthful amounts of sugar, Saturated fat, Trans fat, and salt. The guidelines are voluntary but companies experience heavy pressure to comply. Once a company complies they have 5–10 years to comply with the guidelines. Many fast-food industries have started to comply with the guidelines. Although many companies have ways to go. In 2012 the fast-food industry spent $4.6 billion to advertise unhealthy products to children and teens according to a report by the Yale Rudd Center for Food Policy &amp; Obesity. There are points of progress that include healthier sides and beverages in most fast-food restaurant kids&#x27; meals. The guidelines are interested in a healthier lifestyle for children and the growing problem of American obesity.

While it may not be so obvious today, fast food is on its way to healthier foods and menus. Some businesses have taken off and had success in this market with healthy foods and due to many health concerns and fast-food stereotypes, it is emerging as an expected thing. According to Jason Daley, healthful fast-food takeoff is explained by the fact that it has &quot;ceased to be a thing-now, it&#x27;s simply expected.&quot;

In other parts of the world, American and American-style fast-food outlets have been popular for their quality, customer service, and novelty, even though they are often the targets of popular anger towards American foreign policy or globalization more generally. Many consumers nonetheless see them as symbols of the wealth, progress, and well-ordered openness of Western society and they therefore become trendy attractions in many cities around the world, particularly among younger people with more varied tastes. 

===Impact of fast-food restaurant availability===
Over time, fast-food restaurants have been growing rapidly, especially in urban neighborhoods. According to US research, low-income and predominantly African-American neighborhoods have greater exposure to fast-food outlets than higher income and predominantly white areas. This has put into question whether urbanized neighborhoods were targeted, which causes a more unhealthy group of people compared to people from a higher socioeconomic status. It has also been shown that there is a lower chance of finding a fast-food restaurant in a suburban neighborhood. In a study of selected US locations, Morland et al. (2002) found the number of fast-food restaurants and bars was inversely proportional to the wealth of the neighborhood, and that predominantly African-American residential areas were four times less likely to have a supermarket near them than predominantly white areas.

===Innovations timeline===
* 1872: Walter Scott of Providence, RI outfitted a horse-drawn lunch wagon with a simple kitchen, bringing hot dinners to workers
* 1916: Walter Anderson built the first White Castle in Wichita, KS in 1916, introducing the limited menu, high volume, low cost, high speed hamburger restaurant
* 1919: A&amp;W Root Beer took its product out of the soda fountain and into a roadside stand
* 1921: A&amp;W Root Beer began franchising its syrup
* 1930s: Howard Johnson&#x27;s pioneered the concept of franchising restaurants, formally standardizing menus, signage, and advertising
* 1967: McDonald&#x27;s opens its first restaurants outside the US.

===Halal===
The introduction of the halal option by some fast-food companies saw the expansion of fast-food chains into Muslim majority countries has resulted in a rise of restaurant options in non-western nations and has also increased revenue for some western restaurant chains. Some outlets offering Halal options include KFC, Nando&#x27;s, Pizza Express, and Subway. McDonald&#x27;s carried out a trial but decided that the cost of operations would be too high. There have also been court cases involving start-up businesses during attempts to alter the halal-certified method by machine killing, which is against the beliefs of some Muslims. However, the trend towards halal has been unpopular in some communities which have at times resulted in internet petitions.

==Criticisms==
The fast-food industry is a popular target for critics, from anti-globalization activists like José Bové to vegetarian activist groups such as PETA as well as the workers themselves. A number of fast-food worker strikes occurred in the United States in the 2010s.

In his best-selling 2001 book &quot;Fast Food Nation&quot;, investigative journalist Eric Schlosser leveled a broad, socioeconomic critique against the fast-food industry, documenting how fast food rose from small, family-run businesses (like the McDonald brothers&#x27; burger joint) into large, multinational corporate juggernauts whose economies of scale radically transformed agriculture, meat processing, and labor markets in the late twentieth century. Schlosser argues that while the innovations of the fast-food industry gave Americans more and cheaper dining options, it has come at the price of destroying the environment, economy, and small-town communities of rural America while shielding consumers from the real costs of their convenient meal, both in terms of health and the broader impact of large-scale food production and processing on workers, animals, and land.

The fast-food industry is popular in the United States, the source of most of its innovation, and many major international chains are based there. Seen as symbols of US dominance and perceived cultural imperialism, American fast-food franchises have often been the target of Anti-globalization protests and demonstrations against the US government. In 2005, for example, rioters in Karachi, Pakistan, who were initially angered because of the bombing of a Shiite mosque, destroyed a KFC restaurant.

==Legal issues==

In August 2002, a group of overweight children in New York City filed a class-action lawsuit against McDonald&#x27;s Corporation seeking compensation for obesity-related health problems, improved nutritional labeling of McDonald&#x27;s products, and funding for a program to educate consumers about the dangers of fast food. This provoked an intense, mostly negative response in the media with columnists calling this case a &quot;cartoon of a lawsuit&quot;.

This kind of litigation raises the important question of who, if anyone, ought to be held accountable for the economic and public health consequences of obesity.

In 2003, McDonald&#x27;s was sued in a New York court by a family who claimed that the restaurant chain was responsible for their teenage daughter&#x27;s obesity and attendant health problems. By manipulating food&#x27;s taste, sugar and fat content, and directing their advertising to children, the suit argued that the company purposely misleads the public about the nutritional value of its product. A judge dismissed the case, but the fast-food industry disliked the publicity of its practices, particularly the way it targets children in its advertising. Although further lawsuits have not materialized, the issue is kept alive in the media and political circles by those promoting the need for tort reform.

In response to this, the &quot;Cheeseburger Bill&quot; was passed by the US House of Representatives in 2004; it later stalled in the US Senate. The law was reintroduced in 2005, only to meet the same fate. This law was claimed to &quot;[ban] frivolous lawsuits against producers and sellers of food and non-alcoholic drinks arising from obesity claims.&quot;
The bill arose because of an increase in lawsuits against fast-food chains by people who claimed that eating their products &quot;made&quot; them obese, disassociating themselves from any of the blame.

<text>Cardonald (; , ) is an outlying suburb of the Scottish city of Glasgow. Formerly a village in its own right, it lies to the southwest of the city and is bounded to the south by the White Cart Water. The area was part of Renfrewshire until 1926 when the villages of Cardonald, Crookston, Halfway and their surrounding farmland were annexed to Glasgow.

==History==
In the 15th century the lands of Cardonald in Renfrew were the property of Johannes Norwald or Normanville, Dominus of Cardownalde. His granddaughter and heiress, Marion Stewart (daughter of Isabella Norwald of Cardonald and Sir William Stewart of Castlemilk), married Allan Stewart, establishing the line of Stewarts of Cardonald. The Cardonald Stewarts were a junior branch of the House of Stewart. Allan Stewart of Cardonald, the first Stewart of Cardonald, was the younger son of John Stewart, 1st Earl of Lennox. The Cardonald Stewarts had their seat at the &quot;Place of Cardonald&quot; (also known as Cardonald Castle or Cardonald House), built in 1565. It was demolished and replaced by a farmhouse – Cardonald Place Farm – in 1848. A corn mill existed in Cardonald from around 1789 until it was demolished in 1958. The site of Cardonald Mill is now occupied by the houses on Lade Terrace.

The line of the Stewarts of Cardonald ended with Allan&#x27;s great-grandson, James Stewart of Cardonald (1512–1584). He had served as a captain in the Scottish Guards of the Kings of France, and is buried in Paisley Abbey. As he had no issue, the lands of Cardonald passed to his sister&#x27;s son, Walter Stewart, 1st Lord Blantyre. His family resided at the Place of Cardonald for generations, and retained lands in Cardonald until the 20th century. With the death of the 12th Lord Blantyre in 1900, his estates passed to his grandson, William Arthur Baird.
The transformation of Cardonald from a rural to an urban community was largely brought about by the coming of the railway and the tram in the 19th century. The first railway to reach Cardonald was the Glasgow, Paisley and Greenock Railway, with a station (then known as Moss Road station) opening on Berryknowes Road in 1843. However, due to poor traffic returns, this station was closed in 1845. In 1879, the present day Cardonald railway station opened on the same site. The siting of this station influenced the building of the terrace of houses at Hillington Park Circus and the large country houses of Dalveon and Turnberry on Berryknowes Road, along with the terraced houses in Kingsland and Queensland Drive. There was also the lodge house on Berryknowes road next to Dalveon house which was part of the estate (now Craigton cemetery) that contained Cruickston Hall (now the site of the new Lourdes Primary School) and Craigton House.
With the arrival of the electric tram in 1903, the growth of Cardonald began in earnest along the stretch of Paisley Road West between the villages of Cardonald and Halfway, with the building of Cardonald Police station (1905) and Nazareth House (1906). In 1926, Glasgow Corporation bought the Cardonald estates from William Arthur Baird. The final upsurge in house building in the area took place from 1931, when most of the existing farm land disappeared, with the building of the North Cardonald and South Cardonald houses by the &quot;Western Heritable Investment Company&quot; after 1935. North Cardonald was mostly made up of owner-occupied houses and council homes owned by Glasgow Corporation (the predecessor to Glasgow City Council), while South Cardonald was mostly composed of owner-occupied and privately rented cottage flats. The 1930s also saw the building of two cinemas in the area, The Westway (1934–1960) and the Aldwych/Vogue (1938–1964). The Westway later became the Flamingo ballroom, and was then a bingo hall until its demolition in 2003. The Vogue was demolished in 1964. Both have supermarkets in their place today.

In the 1950s, the Corporation erected the UK&#x27;s first high-rise flats in the area. Although only 10 storeys high, the Moss Heights flats were the first of many high-rise blocks to be built in Glasgow. They were revolutionary in the fact that their heating system was supplied from a central coal-fired boiler house. They have been renovated and survive well into the 21st century, unlike other developments constructed in later decades.

==Education==
The first school in the vicinity of Cardonald was established at Halfway in 1790, by a local blacksmith who taught the rudiments of reading, writing and arithmetic. In 1860, Cardonald School was established when a school building and teacher&#x27;s house were built at the corner of Paisley Road West and Lammermoor Avenue. The two-roomed, single-storey school building was extended in 1899 with the addition of a second storey, and was further extended in 1911.

Cardonald School remained the only school in the area until the 1930s when Lourdes Primary School and Angus Oval Primary School were built. Cardonald School transferred to the new building (built on the site of the former Angus Oval Primary School) in 1965. NB Angus Oval had acted as an annexe for Cardonald Primary for some years - handling Primaries 1 and 2 until around 1963. The old Cardonald School building on Paisley Rd. West was used as a careers office and for a number of other uses, before being demolished in 2003.
In the heart of north Cardonald was Belses Primary school. Sited on Belses Drive at the junction of Kingsland Drive. This was an annexe for the larger Hillington Primary school.
After this wooden school was demolished a new school was built on the existing playing field at Hallrule drive. The Roman Catholic Lourdes Secondary School was opened in 1956.

Cardonald College, one of Scotland&#x27;s largest further education colleges, opened in 1972. It merged with Anniesland College and Langside College in August 2013 to form Glasgow Clyde College, and was renamed Cardonald Campus.

==Religion==
The oldest church in the area is Cardonald Parish Church (Church of Scotland), which was built at the corner of Paisley Road West and Cardonald Place Road on a plot of ground which was donated by Lord Blantyre. The red sandstone church, designed by Peter Macgregor Chalmers, was built 1887-1889 and was dedicated in February 1889. The west wing was added in 1899 and the east wing in 1925, while the church halls were built in 1940.
Hillington Park Parish Church (Church of Scotland) was originally called “Cardonald United Free Church”, with the current church hall on Berryknowes Road being built as a parish church of the United Free Church of Scotland in 1908. The harled red sandstone church was built 1924-1925. With the union of the United Free Church and the Church of Scotland in 1929, the church was renamed as Hillington Park Parish Church.

The local Roman Catholic church, Our Lady of Lourdes, was designed by Stellmacs Ltd and built 1937-1939. This church, which opened in May 1939, replaced an earlier small chapel which had been built on the site in 1922. The local Catholic community had originally met in Maryland House and then from 1906 in the chapel of Nazareth House.

The Church of the Good Shepherd (Scottish Episcopal Church) on Hillington Road was designed by Noad &amp; Wallace and was built 1939-1940. Before this church was built, the congregation, which was formed in 1938, had met in a shop at 2222 Paisley Road West.

==Amenities==
Cardonald Bowling Club was established in 1914 and is a popular club within the area.

==Transport==
The district is served by Cardonald railway station on the Inverclyde Line and by Mosspark railway station on the Paisley Canal line, as well as numerous bus routes. There is also easy access to the Clyde Tunnel and the M8 motorway via Junction 25.

The number 9 and 9A buses (First Bus) and 38 (McGills) pass regularly along Paisley Road West. There are around ten buses per hour during peak times, and around four buses per hour early morning and in the evenings and on Sundays.

<doc id="54929" wikidata="Q35625" url="?curid=54929" title="Ginger">
<text>Ginger (&quot;Zingiber officinale&quot;) is a flowering plant whose rhizome, ginger root or ginger, is widely used as a spice and a folk medicine. It is an herbaceous perennial that grows annual pseudostems (false stems made of the rolled bases of leaves) about one meter tall, bearing narrow leaf blades. The inflorescences bear flowers having pale yellow petals with purple edges, and arise directly from the rhizome on separate shoots.

Ginger is in the family Zingiberaceae, which also includes turmeric (&quot;Curcuma longa&quot;), cardamom (&quot;Elettaria cardamomum&quot;), and galangal. Ginger originated in Maritime Southeast Asia and was likely domesticated first by the Austronesian peoples. It was transported with them throughout the Indo-Pacific during the Austronesian expansion ( BP), reaching as far as Hawaii. Ginger is one of the first spices to have been exported from Asia, arriving in Europe with the spice trade, and was used by ancient Greeks and Romans. The distantly related dicots in the genus &quot;Asarum&quot; are commonly called wild ginger because of their similar taste. 

Ginger has been used in traditional medicine in China, India and Japan for centuries, and as a dietary supplement. There is no good evidence that ginger helps alleviate nausea and vomiting associated with pregnancy or chemotherapy, and its safety has not been demonstrated. It remains uncertain whether ginger is effective for treating any disease, and use of ginger as a drug has not been approved by the FDA. In 2020, world production of ginger was 4.3 million tonnes, led by India with 43% of the world total.

==Etymology==

The English origin of the word &quot;ginger&quot; is from the mid-14th century, from Old English , which derives in turn from the Medieval Latin , from the Greek from the Prakrit (Middle Indic) , and from the Sanskrit . The Sanskrit word is thought to come from an ancient Dravidian word that also produced the Tamil and Malayalam term (from , &quot;root&quot;); an alternative explanation is that the Sanskrit word comes from , meaning &quot;horn&quot;, and , meaning &quot;body&quot; (describing the shape of its root), but that may be folk etymology. The word probably was readopted in Middle English from the Old French (modern French ).

==Origin and distribution==
Ginger originated from Maritime Southeast Asia. It is a true cultigen and does not exist in its wild state. The most ancient evidence of its domestication is among the Austronesian peoples where it was among several species of ginger cultivated and exploited since ancient times. They cultivated other gingers including turmeric (&quot;Curcuma longa&quot;), white turmeric (&quot;Curcuma zedoaria&quot;), and bitter ginger (&quot;Zingiber zerumbet&quot;). The rhizomes and the leaves were used to flavour food or eaten directly. The leaves were also used to weave mats. Aside from these uses, ginger had religious significance among Austronesians, being used in rituals for healing and for asking protection from spirits. It was also used in the blessing of Austronesian ships.

Ginger was carried with them in their voyages as canoe plants during the Austronesian expansion, starting from around 5,000 BP. They introduced it to the Pacific Islands in prehistory, long before any contact with other civilizations. Reflexes of the Proto-Malayo-Polynesian word &quot;*&quot; are found in Austronesian languages all the way to Hawaii. They also presumably introduced it to India along with other Southeast Asian food plants and Austronesian sailing technologies, during early contact by Austronesian sailors with the Dravidian-speaking peoples of Sri Lanka and South India at around 3,500 BP. It was also carried by Austronesian voyagers into Madagascar and the Comoros in the 1st millennium CE.

From India, it was carried by traders into the Middle East and the Mediterranean by around the 1st century CE. It was primarily grown in southern India and the Greater Sunda Islands during the spice trade, along with peppers, cloves, and numerous other spices.

== History ==
The first written record of ginger comes from the &quot;Analects&quot;, written by the Disciples of Confucius in China during the Warring States period (475–221 BCE). In it, Confucius was said to eat ginger with every meal. In 406, the monk Faxian wrote that ginger was grown in pots and carried on Chinese ships to prevent scurvy. During the Song dynasty (960–1279), ginger was being imported into China from southern countries.

Ginger spice was introduced to the Mediterranean by the Arabs, and described by writers like Dioscorides (40–90) and Pliny the Elder (24–79). In 150, Ptolemy noted that ginger was produced in Ceylon (Sri Lanka). Ginger—along with its relative, galangal—was imported into the Roman Empire as part of very expensive herbal remedies that only the wealthy could afford, e.g. for the kidneys. Aëtius of Amida describes both ginger and galangal as ingredients in his complex herbal prescriptions. Raw and preserved ginger were imported into Europe in increased quantity during the Middle Ages after European tastes shifted favorably towards its culinary properties; during this time, ginger was described in the official pharmacopeias of several countries. In 14th century England, a pound of ginger cost as much as a sheep.

Archaeological evidence of ginger in northwest Europe comes from the wreck of the Danish-Norwegian flagship, &quot;Gribshunden&quot;. The ship sank off the southern coast of Sweden in the summer of 1495 while conveying King Hans to a summit with the Swedish Council. Among the luxuries carried on the ship were ginger, cloves, saffron, and pepper.

The ginger plant was smuggled onto the Caribbean islands from Asia sometime in the 16th century, along with black pepper, cloves, and cinnamon, at the encouragement of the Spanish Crown, though only ginger thrived. It eventually displaced sugar to become the leading export crop on both Hispaniola and Puerto Rico by the end of the century, until the introduction of slave labour from Africa made sugar more economical to produce in the 17th century.

==Horticulture==

Ginger produces clusters of white and pink flower buds that bloom into yellow flowers. Because of its aesthetic appeal and the adaptation of the plant to warm climates, it is often used as landscaping around subtropical homes. It is a perennial reed-like plant with annual leafy stems, about a meter (3 to 4 feet) tall. Traditionally, the rhizome is gathered when the stalk ; it is immediately , or washed and scraped, to kill it and prevent sprouting. The fragrant perisperm of the Zingiberaceae is used as sweetmeats by Bantu, and also as a condiment and sialogogue.

==Production==
In 2020, global production of ginger was 4.3 million tonnes, led by India with 43% of the world total. Nigeria, China, and Nepal also had substantial production.

=== Production in India ===
Though it is grown in many areas across the globe, ginger is &quot;among the earliest recorded spices to be cultivated and exported from southwest India&quot;. India holds the seventh position in ginger export worldwide, however is the &quot;largest producer of ginger in the world&quot;. Regions in southwest and Northeast India are most suitable for ginger production due to their warm and humid climate, average rainfall and land space.

Ginger has the ability to grow in a wide variety of land types and areas, however is best produced when grown in a warm, humid environment, at an elevation between , and in well-drained soils at least 30 cm deep. A period of low rainfall prior to growing and well-distributed rainfall during growing are also essential for the ginger to thrive well in the soil.

Ginger produced in India is most often farmed through homestead farming, with work adaptively shared by available family and community members.

== Ginger farming ==
The size of the ginger rhizome is essential to the production of ginger. The larger the rhizome piece, the faster ginger will be produced and therefore the faster it will be sold onto the market. Prior to planting the seed rhizomes, farmers are required to treat the seeds to prevent pests, and rhizome rot and other seed-borne diseases. Various ways Indian farmers do seed treatment include dipping the seeds in cow dung emulsion, smoking the seeds before storage, and hot water treatment.

Once the seeds are properly treated, the farmland in which they are to be planted must be thoroughly dug or ploughed by the farmer to break up the soil. After the soil is sufficiently ploughed (at least 3–5 times), water channels are made apart to irrigate the crop.

The next step is planting the rhizome seed. In India, planting the irrigated ginger crop is usually done in the months between March and June as those months account for the beginning of the monsoon, or rainy season. Once the planting stage is done, farmers go on to mulch the crop to conserve moisture and check weed growth, as well as check surface run-off to conserve soil. Mulching is done by applying mulch (green leaves for example) to the plant beds directly after planting and again 45 and 90 days into growth. After mulching comes hilling, which is the stirring and breaking up of soil to check weed growth, break the firmness of the soil from rain, and conserve soil moisture. Farmers must ensure that their ginger crops are receiving supplemental irrigation if rainfall is low in their region. In India, farmers must irrigate their ginger crops every two weeks at the least between September and November (when the monsoon is over) to ensure maximum yield and high quality product.

The final farming stage for ginger is the harvesting stage. When the rhizome is planted for products such as vegetable, soda, and candy, harvesting should be done between four and five months of planting, whereas when the rhizome is planted for products such as dried ginger or ginger oil, harvesting must be done eight to ten months after planting.

Dry ginger is one of the most popular forms of ginger in commerce. Ginger rhizomes for dry ginger are harvested at full maturity (8–10 months). After soaking them in water, the outer skin is scraped off with a bamboo splinter or wooden knife by hand as it is too delicate a process to be done by machinery. The whole dried rhizomes are ground in the consuming centres. Fresh ginger does not need further processing after harvest, and it is harvested much younger.

== Transportation and export of ginger ==
Ginger is sent through various stages to be transported to its final destination either domestically or internationally. The journey begins when farmers sell a portion of their produce to village traders who collect produce right at the farm gate. Once the produce is collected, it is transported to the closest assembly market where it is then taken to main regional or district level marketing centres. Farmers with a large yield of produce will directly take their produce to local or regional markets. Once the produce has &quot;reached [the] regional level markets, they are cleaned, graded, and packed in sacks of about 60 kg&quot;. They are then moved to terminal markets such as in New Delhi, Kochi, and Bombay.

States from which ginger is exported follow the marketing channels of vegetable marketing in India, and the steps are similar to those when transported domestically. However, instead of reaching a terminal market after the regional forwarding centres, the produce will reach an export market and then be sent off by vehicle, plane or boat to reach its final international destination, where it will arrive at a local retail market and finally reach the consumer once purchased.

Dry ginger is most popularly traded between Asian countries through a unique distribution system involving a network of small retail outlets. Fresh and preserved ginger are often sold directly to supermarket chains, and in some countries fresh ginger is seen exclusively in small shops unique to certain ethnic communities. India frequently exports its ginger and other vegetable produce to nearby Pakistan and Bangladesh, as well as &quot;Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, the United States, Yemen Republic, the United Kingdom, and Netherlands&quot;.

Though India is the largest ginger producer in the world, it fails to play the role of a large exporter and only accounts for about 1.17% of total ginger exports. Ginger farming in India is a costly and risky business, as farmers do not gain much money from exports and &quot;more than 65% of the total cost incurred is toward labor and seed material purchase&quot;. The farm owner may benefit given that there is no losses in production or price decreases, which is not easily avoidable. Production of dry ginger proves to have a higher benefit-cost ratio, as well as ginger cultivated in intercropping systems rather than as a pure crop.

==Uses==
===Culinary===

Ginger is a common spice used worldwide, whether for meals or as a folk medicine. Ginger can be used for a variety of food items such as vegetables, candy, soda, pickles, and alcoholic beverages.

Ginger is a fragrant kitchen spice. Young ginger rhizomes are juicy and fleshy with a mild taste. They are often pickled in vinegar or sherry as a snack or cooked as an ingredient in many dishes. They can be steeped in boiling water to make ginger herb tea, to which honey may be added. Ginger can be made into candy or ginger wine.

====Asia====
Mature ginger rhizomes are fibrous and nearly dry. The juice from ginger roots is often used as a seasoning in Indian recipes and is a common ingredient of Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese, and many South Asian cuisines for flavoring dishes such as seafood, meat, and vegetarian dishes.

In Indian cuisine, ginger is a key ingredient, especially in thicker gravies, as well as in many other dishes, both vegetarian and meat-based. Ginger has a role in traditional Ayurvedic medicine. It is an ingredient in traditional Indian drinks, both cold and hot, including spiced &quot;masala chai&quot;. Fresh ginger is one of the main spices used for making pulse and lentil curries and other vegetable preparations. Fresh ginger together with peeled garlic cloves is crushed or ground to form ginger garlic masala. Fresh, as well as dried, ginger is used to spice tea and coffee, especially in winter. In south India, &quot;sambharam&quot; is a summer yogurt drink made with ginger as a key ingredient, along with green chillies, salt and curry leaves. Ginger powder is used in food preparations intended primarily for pregnant or nursing women, the most popular one being &quot;katlu&quot;, which is a mixture of gum resin, &quot;ghee&quot;, nuts, and sugar. Ginger is also consumed in candied and pickled form. In Japan, ginger is pickled to make &quot;beni shōga&quot; and &quot;gari&quot; or grated and used raw on tofu or noodles. It is made into a candy called &quot;shoga no sato zuke&quot;. In the traditional Korean &quot;kimchi&quot;, ginger is either finely minced or just juiced to avoid the fibrous texture and added to the ingredients of the spicy paste just before the fermenting process.
In Myanmar, ginger is called &quot;gyin&quot;. It is widely used in cooking and as a main ingredient in traditional medicines. It is consumed as a salad dish called &quot;gyin-thot&quot;, which consists of shredded ginger preserved in oil, with a variety of nuts and seeds. In Thailand&#x27; where it is called ขิง &quot;khing&quot;, it is used to make a ginger garlic paste in cooking. In Indonesia, a beverage called &quot;wedang jahe&quot; is made from ginger and palm sugar. Indonesians also use ground ginger root, called &quot;jahe&quot;, as a common ingredient in local recipes. In Malaysia, ginger is called &quot;halia&quot; and used in many kinds of dishes, especially soups. Called &quot;luya&quot; in the Philippines, ginger is a common ingredient in local dishes and is brewed as a tea called &quot;salabat&quot;. In Vietnam, the fresh leaves, finely chopped, can be added to shrimp-and-yam soup (&quot;canh khoai mỡ&quot;) as a top garnish and spice to add a much subtler flavor of ginger than the chopped root. In China, sliced or whole ginger root is often paired with savory dishes such as fish, and chopped ginger root is commonly paired with meat, when it is cooked. Candied ginger is sometimes a component of Chinese candy boxes, and a herbal tea can be prepared from ginger. Raw ginger juice can be used to set milk and make a dessert, ginger milk curd.

====North America====
In the Caribbean, ginger is a popular spice for cooking and for making drinks such as sorrel, a drink made during the Christmas season. Jamaicans make ginger beer both as a carbonated beverage and also fresh in their homes. Ginger tea is often made from fresh ginger, as well as the famous regional specialty Jamaican ginger cake.

====Western countries====
In Western cuisine, ginger is traditionally used mainly in sweet foods such as ginger ale, gingerbread, ginger snaps, parkin, and speculaas. A ginger-flavored liqueur called Canton is produced in Jarnac, France. Ginger wine is a ginger-flavoured wine produced in the United Kingdom, traditionally sold in a green glass bottle. Ginger is also used as a spice added to hot coffee and tea. On the island of Corfu, Greece, a traditional drink called τσιτσιμπύρα (&quot;tsitsibira&quot;), a type of ginger beer, is made. The people of Corfu and the rest of the Ionian islands adopted the drink from the British, during the period of the United States of the Ionian Islands.

Fresh ginger can be substituted for ground ginger at a ratio of six to one, although the flavours of fresh and dried ginger are somewhat different. Powdered dry ginger root is typically used as a flavouring for recipes such as gingerbread, cookies, crackers and cakes, ginger ale, and ginger beer. Candied or crystallized ginger, known in the UK as &quot;stem ginger&quot;, is the root cooked in sugar until soft, and is a type of confectionery. Fresh ginger may be peeled before eating. For longer-term storage, the ginger can be placed in a plastic bag and refrigerated or frozen.

====Middle East====
Ginger is used in Iranian cuisine. Ginger bread is a kind of cookie traditionally prepared in the city of Gorgan on the holiday of Nowruz (New Year&#x27;s Day).

===Similar ingredients===
Other members of the family Zingiberaceae are used in similar ways. They include the &quot;myoga&quot; (&quot;Zingiber mioga&quot;), the several types of galangal, the fingerroot (&quot;Boesenbergia rotunda&quot;), and the bitter ginger (&quot;Zingiber zerumbet&quot;).

A dicotyledonous native species of eastern North America, &quot;Asarum canadense&quot;, is also known as &quot;wild ginger&quot;, and its root has similar aromatic properties, but it is not related to true ginger. The plant contains aristolochic acid, a carcinogenic compound. The United States Food and Drug Administration warns that consumption of aristolochic acid-containing products is associated with &quot;permanent kidney damage, sometimes resulting in kidney failure that has required kidney dialysis or kidney transplantation. In addition, some patients have developed certain types of cancers, most often occurring in the urinary tract.&quot;

==Nutrition==
Raw ginger is 79% water, 18% carbohydrates, 2% protein, and 1% fat (table). In a reference amount of , raw ginger supplies of food energy and moderate amounts of potassium (14% of the Daily Value, DV), magnesium (10% DV) and manganese (10% DV), but otherwise is low in micronutrient content (table).

==Composition and safety==
If consumed in reasonable quantities, ginger has few negative side effects, although large amounts may cause adverse events, such as gastrointestinal discomfort, and undesirable interactions with prescription drugs. It is on the FDA&#x27;s &quot;generally recognized as safe&quot; list, though it does interact with some medications, including the anticoagulant drug warfarin and the cardiovascular drug nifedipine.

===Chemistry===
The characteristic fragrance and flavor of ginger result from volatile oils that compose 1–3% of the weight of fresh ginger, primarily consisting of sesquiterpenes, such as beta-bisabolene and zingiberene, zingerone, shogaols, and gingerols with [6]-gingerol (1-[4&#x27;-hydroxy-3&#x27;-methoxyphenyl]-5-hydroxy-3-decanone) as the major pungent compound. Some 400 chemical compounds exist in raw ginger.

Zingerone is produced from gingerols during drying, having lower pungency and a spicy-sweet aroma. Shogaols are more pungent, and are formed from gingerols during heating, storage or via acidity. Numerous monoterpenes, amino acids, dietary fiber, protein, phytosterols, vitamins, and dietary minerals are other constituents. Fresh ginger also contains an enzyme zingibain which is a cysteine protease and has similar properties to rennet.

==Research==
Evidence that ginger use is associated with reduced nausea during pregnancy is of low quality. There is no good evidence ginger helps alleviate chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.

There is no clear evidence that taking ginger to treat nausea during pregnancy is safe. Ginger is not effective for treating dysmenorrhea. There is some evidence for it having an anti-inflammatory effect, and improving digestive function, but insufficient evidence for it affecting pain in osteoarthritis. The evidence that ginger retards blood clotting is mixed.

A 2018 review found evidence that ginger could decrease body weight in obese subjects and increase HDL-cholesterol.

==Adverse effects==
Although generally recognized as safe, ginger can cause heartburn and other side effects, particularly if taken in powdered form. It may adversely affect individuals with gallstones, and may interfere with the effects of anticoagulants, such as warfarin or aspirin, and other prescription drugs.

<text>A fumarole (or fumerole) is a vent in the surface of the Earth or another rocky planet from which hot volcanic gases and vapors are emitted, without any accompanying liquids or solids. Fumaroles are characteristic of the late stages of volcanic activity, but fumarole activity can also precede a volcanic eruption and has been used for eruption prediction. Most fumaroles die down within a few days or weeks of the end of an eruption, but a few are persistent, lasting for decades or longer. An area containing fumaroles is known as a fumarole field.

The predominant vapor emitted by fumaroles is steam, formed by the circulation of groundwater through heated rock. This is typically accompanied by volcanic gases given off by magma cooling deep below the surface. These volcanic gases include sulfur compounds, such as various sulfur oxides and hydrogen sulfide, and sometimes hydrogen chloride, hydrogen fluoride, and other gases. A fumarole that emits significant sulfur compounds is sometimes called a solfatara.

Fumarole activity can break down rock around the vent, while simultaneously depositing sulfur and other minerals. Valuable hydrothermal mineral deposits can form beneath fumaroles. However, active fumaroles can be a hazard due to their emission of hot, poisonous gases.

==Description==

A &quot;fumarole&quot; (or &quot;fumerole&quot;; from French &quot;fumerolle&quot;, a domed structure with lateral openings, built over a kitchen to permit the escape of smoke) is an opening in a planet&#x27;s crust which emits steam and gases, but no liquid or solid material. The temperature of the gases leaving the vent ranges from about . The steam forms when groundwater is superheated by hot rock, then flashes (boils due to depressurization) as it approaches the surface.

In addition to steam, gases released by fumaroles include carbon dioxide, sulfur oxides, hydrogen sulfide, hydrogen chloride, and hydrogen fluoride. These have their origin in magma cooling underground. Not all these gases are present in all fumaroles; for example, fumaroles of Kilauea in Hawaii, US, contain almost no hydrogen chloride or hydrogen fluoride. The gases may also include traces of carbonyl sulfide, carbon disulfide, hydrogen, methane, or carbon monoxide. A fumarole that emits sulfurous gases can be referred to as a &quot;solfatara&quot; (from old Italian &quot;solfo&quot;, &quot;sulfur&quot;). Acid-sulfate hot springs can be formed by fumaroles when some of the steam condenses at the surface. Rising acidic vapors from below, such as CO2 and H2S, will then dissolve, creating steam-heated low-pH hot springs.

Fumaroles are normally associated with the late stages of volcanic activity, although they may also precede volcanic activity and have been used to predict volcanic eruptions. In particular, changes in the composition and temperature of fumarole gases may point to an imminent eruption. An increase in sulfur oxide emissions is a particularly robust indication that new magma is rising from the depths, and may be detectable months to years before the eruption. Continued sulfur oxide emissions after an eruption is an indication that magma is continuing to rise towards the surface.

Fumaroles may occur along tiny cracks, along long fissures, or in chaotic clusters or fields. They also occur on the surface of lava flows and pyroclastic flows. A &quot;fumarole field&quot; is an area of thermal springs and gas vents where shallow magma or hot igneous rocks release gases or interact with groundwater. When they occur in freezing environments, fumaroles may cause fumarolic ice towers.

Fumaroles may persist for decades or centuries if located above a persistent heat source; or they may disappear within weeks to months if they occur atop a fresh volcanic deposit that quickly cools. The Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes, for example, was formed during the 1912 eruption of Novarupta in Alaska. Initially, thousands of fumaroles occurred in the cooling ash from the eruption, but over time most of them have become extinct. Persistent fumaroles are found at Sulfur Bank on the northern edge of the Kilauea caldera, but most fumaroles in Hawaii last no more than a few months. There are still numerous active fumaroles at Yellowstone National Park, US, some 70,000 years after the most recent eruption.

== Economic resources and hazards ==
The acidic fumes from fumaroles can break down the rock around the vents, producing brightly colored &quot;alteration haloes&quot;. At Sulphur Banks near Kilauea in Hawaii, mild alteration reduces the rock to gray to white opal and kaolinite with the original texture of the rock still discernible. Alteration begins along joints in the rock and works inwards until the entire joint block is altered. More extreme alteration (at lower pH) reduces the material to clay minerals and iron oxides to produce red to reddish-brown clay. The same process can produce valuable hydrothermal ore deposits at depth.

Fumaroles emitting sulfurous vapors form surface deposits of sulfur-rich minerals and of fumarole minerals. Sulfur crystals at Sulfur Banks near Kilauea can grow to in length, and considerable sulfur has been deposited at Sulfur Cone within Mauna Loa caldera. Places in which these deposits have been mined include:

* Kawah Ijen and Arjuno-Welirang, Indonesia
* Purico Complex near San Pedro de Atacama in Chile
* Mount Tongariro in the central North Island, New Zealand (mined by Māori until 1950)
* Whakaari / White Island in the Bay of Plenty, New Zealand (mined from the 1880s to the 1930s)
* Sicily, which had a near-monopoly on sulfur prior to development of the Frasch process for mining sulfur from salt domes.

Sulfur mining in Indonesia is sometimes done for low pay, by hand, without respirators or other protective equipment.

In April 2006 fumarole emissions killed three ski-patrol workers east of Chair 3 at Mammoth Mountain Ski Area in California. The workers were overpowered by an accumulation of toxic fumes (a &quot;mazuku&quot;) in a crevasse they had fallen into.

== Occurrences ==
Fumaroles are found around the world in areas of volcanic activity. A few notable examples include:
* Campi Flegrei, Italy, known since ancient times and regarded as the entrance to Hell, which is now closely monitored because of the hazard it poses to nearby urbanization.
* Central Volcanic Zone, South America
* Corbetti Caldera, Ethiopia, where a geothermal power station is under construction
* Taupō Volcanic Zone, New Zealand, where fumaroles support a unique and critically endangered ecosystem
* Mount Usu, Japan
* Valley of Desolation in Morne Trois Pitons National Park in Dominica
* Furnas, São Miguel Island, Azores (Portugal)
* Yellowstone National Park has thousands of fumaroles, including Black Growler at Norris Geyser Basin and numerous fumaroles dotting Roaring Mountain.

=== On Mars ===
The formation known as Home Plate at Gusev Crater on Mars, which was examined by the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) &quot;Spirit&quot;, is suspected to be the eroded remains of an ancient and extinct fumarole.

<text>Cigars of the Pharaoh () is the fourth volume of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, the series of comic albums by Belgian cartoonist Hergé. Commissioned by the conservative Belgian newspaper &quot;Le Vingtième Siècle&quot; for its children&#x27;s supplement &quot;Le Petit Vingtième&quot;, it was serialised weekly from December 1932 to February 1934. The story tells of young Belgian reporter Tintin and his dog Snowy, who are travelling in Egypt when they discover a pharaoh&#x27;s tomb with dead Egyptologists and boxes of cigars. Pursuing the mystery of the cigars, Tintin and Snowy travel across Southern Arabia and India, and reveal the secrets of an international drug smuggling enterprise.

Following on from &quot;Tintin in America&quot;, &quot;Cigars&quot; was a commercial success, and was published in book form by Casterman shortly after its conclusion. Hergé continued &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; with &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot;, the plot of which followed on from &quot;Cigars&quot;. The series itself became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comic tradition. In 1955, it was re-drawn and coloured by Hergé and his assistants at Studios Hergé to match his distinctive &quot;ligne-claire&quot; style. Critical analysis of the story has focused on its innovation, and the &quot;Adventure&quot; introduces the recurring characters of detectives Thomson and Thompson and villain Rastapopoulos. The comic was loosely adapted by Hergé and Jacques Van Melkebeke for the 1941 play &quot;Tintin in India: The Mystery of the Blue Diamond&quot;; a more faithful adaptation was later made for the 1991 Ellipse/Nelvana animated series &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;.

==Synopsis==
Holidaying on a Mediterranean cruise ship, Tintin and his dog Snowy meet wealthy film producer Rastapopoulos and eccentric Egyptologist Sophocles Sarcophagus. When two policemen (Thomson and Thompson) accuse Tintin of opium smuggling, he escapes the ship and joins Sarcophagus on his search for the undiscovered tomb of the Pharaoh Kih-Oskh, near Cairo. Tintin discovers that the tomb is full of mummified bodies (previous Egyptologists who tried to find the tomb), and boxes of cigars labelled with the mysterious symbol of Kih-Oskh. Sarcophagus disappears inside the tomb and Tintin and Snowy fall unconscious after an unseen enemy gasses them. They are then taken aboard a ship inside wooden sarcophagi, captained by smuggler Allan, but to avoid the coastguard Allan orders the sarcophagi thrown overboard.

Tintin and Snowy are rescued by a gunrunner who sails them to Arabia. Travelling by land, Tintin meets Sheikh Patrash Pasha, a big fan of his, and encounters Rastapopoulos filming a movie. Escaping Thomson and Thompson again, who believe Tintin is part of the gunrunners, Tintin and Snowy travel through the desert, eventually reaching a city. The local army drafts Tintin and then arrests him as a spy, after he finds more cigars labelled with the symbol of Kih-Oskh. Thomson and Thompson rescue him from execution in order to arrest him. However, when the army storms their hideout, Tintin manages to elude the authorities and escapes Arabia boarding a plane.

Tintin runs out of fuel over India, crashing into the jungle. After saving a sick elephant, Tintin discovers Sarcophagus, who has become insane and thinks he is Pharoh Ramesses II. While seeking for help at a nearby village, Sarcophagus gets hypnotized by a fakir who commands him to kill Tintin. Tintin then interrogates the poet Zloty, who is visiting the village. He reveals that there is an international drug smuggling ring determined to kill Tintin. Before he can reveal who the boss is, he is injected with Rajaijah juice (&quot;the poison of madness&quot;) by the fakir, believing that he is Napoleon. Meeting the Maharaja of Gaipajama, the two become friends, with the Maharaja revealing that his family has long been fighting a criminal opium-smuggling gang, and in the process his father and brother went mad. 

The fakir appears and Tintin follows him, discovering the drug cartel&#x27;s hideout. While holding a conference, all the members are dressed in purple-coloured Ku-Klux Klan robes. After successfully capturing all the members of the gang (except the fakir), the Thompsons arrive and explain to Tintin that the Cairo police managed to discover the hideout of the drug smugglers in Egypt. They also realise Tintin is innocent. The fakir escapes, and with the masked leader of the conspiracy, kidnaps the Maharaja&#x27;s son. Tintin pursues them in a sports car, rescuing the boy and capturing the fakir, while the leader falls into a chasm, seemingly dying. Tintin returns to Gaipajama, where his return is celebrated. Unwrapping one of the cigars with the mysterious Kih-Oskh symbol, Tintin explains to the Maharaja how opium was smuggled across the world in the cigars.

==History==

===Background===

Georges Remi—best known under the pen name Hergé—was employed as editor and illustrator of (&quot;&quot;The Little Twentieth&quot;), a children&#x27;s supplement to (&quot;The Twentieth Century&quot;&quot;), a staunchly Roman Catholic, conservative Belgian newspaper based in Hergé&#x27;s native Brussels which was run by the Abbé Norbert Wallez. In 1929, Hergé began &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; comic for , revolving around the exploits of fictional Belgian reporter Tintin. Wallez ordered Hergé to set his first adventure in the Soviet Union to act as anti-socialist propaganda for children (&quot;Tintin in the Land of the Soviets&quot;), to set his second adventure in the Belgian Congo to encourage colonial sentiment (&quot;Tintin in the Congo&quot;), and to set his third adventure in the United States to use the story as a denunciation of American capitalism (&quot;Tintin in America&quot;).

For his fourth &quot;Adventure&quot;, Hergé was eager to write a mystery story. The 1930s saw mystery novels flourish across Western Europe with the success of authors like Agatha Christie and Ellery Queen. The decision to create a scenario around the tomb of Kih-Oskh was influenced by the 1922 discovery of Pharaoh Tutankhamun&#x27;s tomb by Howard Carter and the surrounding tabloid claims regarding a Curse of the Pharaohs. Hergé returned to this theme for &quot;The Seven Crystal Balls&quot; (1948). The name Kih-Oskh was an allusion to the kiosks where was sold. The Kih-Oskh symbol was described by Hergé as a distortion of the Taoist symbol of the Taijitu, with biographer Benoît Peeters thinking that it foreshadowed the &quot;Yellow Mark&quot; that featured in the &quot;Blake and Mortimer&quot; comic &quot;The Yellow &quot;M&quot;&quot; (1952–54) authored by Hergé&#x27;s later collaborator Edgar P. Jacobs. Hergé was aided in the production of &quot;Cigars of the Pharaoh&quot; by his assistant Paul &quot;Jam&quot; Jamin, who was heavily influenced by British magazines &quot;The Humorist&quot; and &quot;Punch&quot;.

Hergé took influence from the published works of French adventurer and gunrunner Henry de Monfreid, particularly his books &quot;Secrets of the Red Sea&quot; and &quot;The Hashish Cruise&quot;. Having lived through the First World War, Hergé disliked arms dealers, and used Monfreid as the basis for the gunrunner character in &quot;Cigars&quot;.
The idea of mummified bodies being lined up along a wall was adopted from Pierre Benoît&#x27;s 1919 book &quot;L&#x27;Atlantide&quot; (&quot;Atlantis&quot;), which had recently been made into a 1932 film by Georg Wilhelm Pabst. The wall paintings depicted on a cover of was based on a bas-relief of Hathor and Seti I housed in the Louvre, Paris, while the throne featured in Tintin&#x27;s dream was adopted from that found in the tomb of Tutankhamun. The inclusion of the secret society operating the smuggling ring was influenced by right-wing conspiracy theories about Freemasonry, with Hergé likely gaining information on the brotherhood from a 1932 article by Lucien Farnoux-Reynaud in the radical magazine &quot;Le Crapouillot&quot; (&quot;The Mortar Shell&quot;).

===Original publication, 1932–34===

On 24 November 1932, &quot;Le Petit Vingtième&quot; published a fictional interview between Jamin and Tintin in which the reporter announced that he would be travelling to China via Egypt, India, Ceylon, and Indochina. Later on 8 December, the story began serialisation in the supplement under the title of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin, Reporter, in the Orient&quot;. As the story began in Egypt rather than China, Hergé briefly renamed the story to &quot;The Cairo Affair&quot;. The story was not following any plan or pre-written plot, with Hergé as usual devising the story on a week-by-week basis.
In Autumn 1934, the adventure was published in a book. &quot;Cigars&quot; was the first of the &quot;Adventures&quot; published by Casterman, with whom Hergé had signed a contract in late 1933, although much to his annoyance, they delayed publication until the autumn of 1934, after the culmination of the summer holidays. In 1936, they successfully requested that he produce several colour plates to be inserted into the reprint of the book.

&quot;Cigars of the Pharaoh&quot; saw the introduction of several characters who would gain a recurring role in &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;. The most notable are the two detectives, who were initially called &quot;Agent X33 and Agent X33 &quot;. In his 1941 Tintin play co-written with Jacques Van Melkebeke, &quot;Tintin in India: The Mystery of the Blue Diamond&quot;, Hergé named them &quot;Durant and Durand&quot;, although he later renamed them &quot;Dupont and Dupond&quot;. The series&#x27; English-language translators, Michael Turner and Leslie Lonsdale-Cooper, renamed them &quot;Thomson and Thompson.&quot; They were based on a combination of the stereotypical Belgian policeman of the 1930s with Hergé&#x27;s observations of his father and uncle, Alexis and Léon Remi, who were identical twins.

The series introduced Tintin&#x27;s adversary Roberto Rastapopoulos in &quot;Cigars of the Pharaoh&quot;, here depicted as a famous Hollywood film director. It is only in the successor volume, &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot;, that he is also revealed as the head of an international criminal organisation. His name was developed by one of Hergé&#x27;s friends; Hergé thought it was hilarious and decided to use it. He devised Rastapopoulos as an Italian with a Greek surname, but the character fitted anti-Semitic stereotypes of Jews; Hergé was adamant that the character was not Jewish. A fourth recurring character introduced in this story was the Portuguese merchant Oliveira da Figueira, who would reappear in both the subsequent &quot;Adventures&quot; set in the Middle East, &quot;Land of Black Gold&quot; and &quot;The Red Sea Sharks&quot;. One of the core characters of the story was Sophocles Sarcophagus, an Egyptologist who is the stereotype of an eccentric professor. In this respect, he is a prototype for the character of Cuthbert Calculus, whom Hergé would introduce later in &quot;Red Rackham&#x27;s Treasure&quot;.

It was during the serialisation of &quot;Cigars&quot; that Wallez was embroiled in a scandal after he was accused of defaming the Bureau of Public Works. The accusation resulted in a legal case being brought against the newspaper, and in response its owners demanded Wallez&#x27;s resignation, which was tended in August 1933. Without Wallez, Hergé became despondent, and in March 1934 he tried to resign, but was encouraged to stay after his workload was reduced and his monthly salary was increased from 2000 to 3000 francs. Jamin subsequently took over Hergé&#x27;s responsibility for the day-to-day running of &quot;Le Petit Vingtième&quot;.

===Second version, 1955===

In the 1940s and 1950s, when Hergé&#x27;s popularity had increased, he and his team at Studios Hergé redrew many of the original black-and-white Tintin adventures in colour using the (&quot;clear line&quot;) drawing style he had developed so that they visually fitted in with the new Tintin stories being created. The Studios reformatted and coloured &quot;Cigars of the Pharaoh&quot; in 1955; it was the last of the early works to undergo this process.

In cutting down the length of the story, Hergé removed various isolated scenes that added nothing to the development of the plot, such as those in which Tintin confronts a bat, a crocodile, and snakes. The Arabian city that Tintin and Snowy searched for in the story was no longer identified as Mecca, while the Maharajah&#x27;s three advisers were removed. New elements were also inserted; Hergé added a depiction of ancient Egyptian pyramids into the background. Hergé also added the character of Allan, who had originally been introduced in the later, 1941 adventure &quot;The Crab with the Golden Claws&quot;, and also appeared as Rastapopoulos&#x27; henchman in later albums. Hergé inserted an allusion to his friend and collaborator Edgar P. Jacobs into the story by including a mummified professor named E.P. Jacobini in the Egyptian tomb.

Whereas the original version had included Sheikh Patrash Pasha showing Tintin a copy of &quot;Tintin in America&quot;, in the 1955 version this was changed to the earlier &quot;Tintin in the Congo&quot;, and Hergé would change it again in 1964 for subsequent printings, this time to &quot;Destination Moon&quot; (1953), an &quot;Adventure&quot; set chronologically after &quot;Cigars&quot;. Benoît Peeters exclaimed that with this scene, the reader can imagine Tintin&#x27;s surprise at encountering an adventure he had not yet had and which included the characters of Captain Haddock and Cuthbert Calculus whom he had not yet met. Another anachronism in this version appears only in the English version, when Snowy refers to Marlinspike Hall, the ancestral home of Captain Haddock, from the much later volumes of the series. Harry Thompson opined that the most important changes to the book were artistic, for in the late 1950s Hergé was at the peak of his artistic ability.

===Later publications===
Casterman republished the original black-and-white version in 1979 in a French-language collected volume with &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot; and &quot;The Broken Ear&quot;, the second part of the collection. In 1983, they then published a facsimile version of the original.

==Critical analysis==
Jean-Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier considered &quot;Cigars of the Pharaoh&quot; to be graphically between &quot;Tintin in America&quot; and &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot;, as Hergé was expanding his &quot;visual vocabulary&quot; and making use of &quot;unforgettable moments&quot; such as the dream sequence in the tomb. Although recognising that Hergé was still devising his plot on a week-by-week basis, they thought that the work was an improvement on his earlier stories because of the inclusion of &quot;mystery and fantasy&quot;.
Awarding it three stars out of five, they thought the book was a &quot;surreal thriller, drenched and atmospheric&quot;. Believing that the work not only dealt with madness, but also was madness, they thought the book evoked &quot;a sense of dreamlike suspension of disbelief&quot;. They also highlighted the inclusion of the Kih-Oskh symbol throughout the book, describing it as being akin to a recurring musical theme, stating that it added &quot;a note of pure oneirism&quot;.

Harry Thompson considered &quot;Cigars of the Pharaoh&quot; &quot;almost completely unrecognisable from its predecessors&quot;, praising its &quot;inspired comic characters&quot; and &quot;observed character comedy&quot;, which he thought escaped the sheer slapstick evident in the earlier &quot;Adventures&quot;. He also praised the elements of mystery and suspense that Hergé introduced, opining that it created &quot;a genuine sense of fear without recourse to a &quot;deus ex machina&quot;&quot;. More critically, he thought that the plot&#x27;s &quot;glaring flaw&quot; was the immediate transposition of events from Egypt to India, also believing that the inclusion of British colonialists as the antagonists made &quot;partial amends&quot; for the colonialist attitude displayed by Tintin in &quot;Tintin in the Congo&quot;. Michael Farr thought that Tintin was &quot;a maturer hero&quot; in &quot;Cigars&quot;, being more of a detective than a reporter. He thought that the dream sequence was &quot;one of the most imaginative and disturbing scenes&quot; in the series, illustrating Hergé&#x27;s &quot;growing virtuosity with the medium&quot;. He also praised the scenes set in the Indian colonial bungalow, commenting that it was &quot;claustrophobic and sinisterly dramatic&quot; and worthy of the work of Agatha Christie, opining that the car chase provided &quot;a highly cinematic ending&quot;. Overall, he thought it to be a narrative &quot;rich in mystery and drama&quot; which was as much of a landmark in the series as &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot;.

Hergé biographer Benoît Peeters thought that with &quot;Cigars&quot;, Hergé was engaging in the &quot;novelesque&quot;, and that the opening scene had echoes of Rodolphe Töpffer&#x27;s &quot;Mr Pencil&quot;. He also thought it the first of the &quot;Adventures&quot; to have a &quot;semblance&quot; of &quot;narrative unity&quot;. Fellow biographer Pierre Assouline thought that the story was difficult for the reader to follow, because the exoticism of the backdrop faded amid the fast pace of the narrative.
Literary critic Tom McCarthy highlighted the prominent role of tobacco in the story, drawing on the ideas of French philosopher Jacques Derrida to suggest the potential symbolism of this. He also suggested that the inclusion of mummified Egyptologists in the story warns readers of the &quot;dangers of mummification through interpretation&quot;.

==Adaptations==
&quot;Cigars of the Pharaoh&quot; was adapted into a 1991 episode of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; television series by French studio Ellipse and Canadian animation company Nelvana. Directed by Stéphane Bernasconi, Thierry Wermuth voiced the character of Tintin. In 2010, the television channel Arte filmed an episode of its documentary series, &quot;Sur les traces de Tintin&quot; (&quot;On the track of Tintin&quot;), in Egypt exploring the inspiration and setting of the &quot;Cigars of the Pharaoh&quot;.

In August 2022, it was announced that Pendulo Studios and Microids would be creating an adventure video game adaptation titled &quot;Tintin Reporter: Cigars of the Pharaoh.&quot; Footage of the game was revealed in March 2023. It was released on November 7, 2023 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S and Nintendo Switch. It received mixed reviews at launch due to numerous bugs and technical issues that players encountered.

<text>King Ottokar&#x27;s Sceptre () is the eighth volume of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, the comics series by Belgian cartoonist Hergé. Commissioned by the conservative Belgian newspaper for its children&#x27;s supplement , it was serialised weekly from August 1938 to August 1939. Hergé intended the story as a satirical criticism of the expansionist policies of Nazi Germany, in particular the annexation of Austria in March 1938 (the &quot;Anschluss&quot;). The story tells of young Belgian reporter Tintin and his dog Snowy, who travel to the fictional Balkan nation of Syldavia, where they combat a plot to overthrow the monarchy of King Muskar XII.

&quot;King Ottokar&#x27;s Sceptre&quot; was a commercial success and was published in book form by Casterman shortly after its conclusion. Hergé continued &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; with &quot;Land of Black Gold&quot; until forced closure in 1940, while the series itself became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. In 1947, Hergé coloured and redrew &quot;King Ottokar&#x27;s Sceptre&quot; in his distinctive style with the aid of Edgar P. Jacobs for Casterman&#x27;s republication. The story introduces the recurring character Bianca Castafiore, and introduced the fictional countries of Syldavia and Borduria, both of which reappear in later stories. The first volume of the series to be translated into English, &quot;King Ottokar&#x27;s Sceptre&quot; was adapted for both the 1956 Belvision Studios animation &quot;Hergé&#x27;s Adventures of Tintin&quot; and for the 1991 Ellipse/Nelvana animated series &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;.

==Synopsis==

Having discovered a lost briefcase in a Belgian park, Tintin returns it to its owner, the sigillographer Professor Hector Alembick, who informs the reporter of his plans to travel to the Balkan nation of Syldavia. Tintin discovers agents spying on the professor and follows those responsible to a nearby Syldavian restaurant. An unknown man agrees to meet with Tintin but is found unconscious and appears to have amnesia. Shortly after, the reporter receives a threatening note and is then the target of a bomb attack; Tintin survives the latter when police detectives Thomson and Thompson intercept the bomb. Suspecting that these events are linked to Syldavia, Tintin decides to accompany Professor Alembick on his forthcoming visit to the country. On the plane journey there, Tintin notices Alembick acting out of character, and suspects that an imposter has replaced him. Reading a brochure on Syldavian history, Tintin theorises that the imposter is part of a plot to steal the sceptre of the medieval King Ottokar IV from the current King Muskar XII before St. Vladimir&#x27;s Day, thus forcing him to abdicate.

Forcibly ejected from the plane by the pilot, Tintin survives and informs local police of his fears regarding the plot. However, the police captain is part of the conspiracy, and he organises an ambush in the woods where Tintin will be eliminated. Tintin evades death, and heads to the capital city of Klow in a car carrying the opera singer Bianca Castafiore. Leaving the car to evade Castafiore&#x27;s singing, Tintin is arrested and survives another assassination attempt before heading to Klow on foot. Arriving in the city, he meets the King&#x27;s &quot;aide-de-camp&quot;, Colonel Boris Jorgen, seeking permission to meet the King. At the Klow Natural History Museum, Snowy has taken a bone away from one of the dinosaurs but Tintin orders Snowy to return it back to the museum. However, Jorgen is also a conspirator and organises a further unsuccessful assassination attempt aimed at Tintin. While Bianca Castafiore is singing at a gala opera, Tintin gatecrashes and he is escorted away by a group of security guards. En route to transferring Tintin to prison, the custody van has an accident trying to avoid a careless pedestrian and Tintin suffers a concussion. Meanwhile, the imposter pretending to be Alembick is allowed into Kropow Castle, where the sceptre is kept. Tintin finally succeeds in personally warning the King about the plot and they both rush to Kropow Castle, only to find that the sceptre is missing. 

With the aid of Thomson and Thompson, who have recently arrived in Syldavia, Tintin discovers how the conspirators smuggled out the sceptre from the Castle and pursues the thieves, first by car and then on foot across the mountains. He is able to prevent the sceptre being carried over the border into neighbouring Borduria, discovering a letter on one of the conspirators. It reveals that the plot has been orchestrated by Müsstler, a political agitator who runs both the Syldavian Iron Guard and the Zyldav Zentral Revolutzionär Komitzät (ZZRK), a subversive organization which intends to have Borduria invade and annex Syldavia. Entering Borduria, Tintin commandeers a fighter plane and heads to Klow, but the Syldavian military shoot him down. Parachuting, he continues to Klow by foot, returning the sceptre to the King on St. Vladimir&#x27;s Day and securing the monarchy. In return, the king makes Tintin a Knight of the Order of the Golden Pelican; the first foreigner to receive the honour. Tintin later learns that the imposter was Alembick&#x27;s twin brother after police arrest Müsstler and rescue Professor Alembick. Afterwards, Tintin and the Thompsons take a flying boat home.

==History==

===Background===

&quot;King Ottokar&#x27;s Sceptre&quot; was not the first Tintin adventure to draw specifically on contemporary events; Hergé had for instance previously made use of the 1931 Japanese invasion of Manchuria as a political backdrop for the setting in &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot;. This time, Hergé had closely observed the unfolding events surrounding the expansionist policies of Nazi Germany. In producing this story, he was particularly influenced by the &quot;Anschluss&quot;, the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany in March 1938. The Munich Agreement and the subsequent Nazi invasion of the Sudetenland followed in October 1938. Three weeks after &quot;King Ottokar&#x27;s Sceptre&quot; finished serialisation, Germany invaded Poland. By this point, the threat to Belgian sovereignty posed by Nazi expansionism was becoming increasingly clear. By 1939, the events surrounding the Italian annexation of Albania made Hergé insist his editor publish the work to take advantage of current events as he felt &quot;Syldavia is Albania&quot;. Later Hergé denied that he had just one country in mind.

Hergé claimed that the basic idea behind the story had been given to him by a friend; biographer Benoît Peeters suggested that the most likely candidate was school and scouting friend Philippe Gérard, who had warned of a second war with Germany for years. &quot;Tintin&quot; scholars have claimed Hergé did not develop the names &quot;Syldavia&quot; and &quot;Borduria&quot; himself; instead, the country names had supposedly appeared in a paper included in a 1937 edition of the &quot;British Journal of Psychology&quot;, in which the author described a hypothetical conflict between a small kingdom and an annexing power. Reportedly, the paper, by Lewis Fry Richardson and entitled &quot;General Foreign Policy&quot;, explored the nature of inter-state conflict in a mathematical way. Peeters attributed these claims to Georges Laurenceau, but said that &quot;no researcher has confirmed this source&quot;. Instead, a paper by Richardson entitled &quot;Generalized Foreign Politics: A Story in Group Psychology&quot; was published in &quot;The British Journal of Psychology Monograph Supplements&quot; in 1939, but did not mention &quot;Syldavia&quot; or &quot;Borduria&quot;. In any case, given the publication date, it is unlikely that it was an influence on &quot;King Ottokar&#x27;s Sceptre&quot;.

Hergé designed Borduria as a satirical depiction of Nazi Germany.
Hergé named the pro-Bordurian agitator &quot;Müsstler&quot; from the surnames of Nazi leader Adolf Hitler and Italy&#x27;s National Fascist leader Benito Mussolini. The name also had similarities with the British Union of Fascists&#x27; leader Oswald Mosley and the National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands&#x27; leader Anton Mussert. Müsstler&#x27;s group was named after the Iron Guard, a Romanian fascist group that sought to oust King Carol II and forge a Romanian-German alliance. The Bordurian officers wore uniforms based on those of the German SS, while the Bordurian planes are German in design; in the original version Tintin escapes in a Heinkel He 112, while in the revised version this is replaced by a Messerschmitt Bf 109. Hergé adopted the basis of Borduria&#x27;s false flag operation to take over Syldavia from the plans outlined in Curzio Malaparte&#x27;s &quot;Coup d&#x27;État: The Technique of Revolution&quot;.

Syldavia&#x27;s depiction was influenced by the costumes and cultures of Romania and the neighboring Balkan region. The mosques that appear in Hergé&#x27;s Syldavia are based on those found throughout the Balkans, while the appearance of the Syldavian village, featuring red-tiled roofs and minarets, may have been specifically inspired by the Bosnian town of Mostar. Syldavia&#x27;s mineral rich subsoil could be taken as a reference to the uranium deposits found under Romania&#x27;s Carpathian Mountains – later to be mentioned directly in the eventual &quot;Destination Moon&quot;. &quot;Tintin&quot; scholars have noted that the black pelican of Syldavia&#x27;s flag resembles the black eagle of Albania&#x27;s flag, and that Romania is the only European country to which pelicans are native.
The name Syldavia may be a composite of Transylvania and Moldavia, two regions with historical ties to Romania. Czech, Slovak, and Bohemian history influenced the Syldavian names, while several medieval Bohemian kings were the inspiration for the name &quot;Ottokar&quot;. The Polish language influenced Hergé&#x27;s inclusion of &quot;–ow&quot; endings to the names of Syldavian places, while Polish history parallels Hergé&#x27;s description of Syldavian history. The Syldavian language used in the book had French syntax but with Marollien vocabulary, a joke understood by the original Brussels-based readership.

However, despite its Eastern European location, Syldavia itself was partly a metaphor for Belgium – Syldavian King Muskar XII physically resembles King Leopold III of Belgium. Hergé&#x27;s decision to create a fictional Eastern European kingdom might have been influenced by Ruritania, the fictional country created by Anthony Hope for his novel &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot; (1894), which subsequently appeared in film adaptations in 1913, 1915, 1922, and 1937. Many places within Syldavia are visually based on pre-existing European sites: the &quot;Diplodocus&quot; in the Klow Natural History Museum is based on the one in the Museum für Naturkunde, Berlin; the Syldavian Royal Palace is based on both the Charlottenburg Palace, Berlin and the Royal Palace of Brussels; and Kropow Castle is based on Olavinlinna Castle, constructed in fifteenth century Savonia – a historical province of the Swedish Kingdom, located in modern-day Finland. For the revised version, Kropow Castle was drawn with an additional tower, inspired by Vyborg Castle, Russia. The United Kingdom also bore at least one influence on Syldavia, as King Muskar XII&#x27;s carriage is based on the British Royal Family&#x27;s Gold State Coach.

===Original publication===
&quot;King Ottokar&#x27;s Sceptre&quot; was first serialised in &quot;Le Petit Vingtième&quot; from 4 August 1938 to 10 August 1939 under the title &quot;Tintin En Syldavie&quot; (&quot;Tintin in Syldavia&quot;). It would prove to be the last Tintin adventure to be published in its entirety in &quot;Le Petit Vingtième&quot;. From 14 May 1939, the story was also serialised in the French Catholic newspaper, &quot;Cœurs Vaillants&quot;.
In 1939, Éditions Casterman collected the story together in a single hardcover volume; Hergé insisted to his contact at Casterman, Charles Lesne, that they hurry up the process due to the changing political situation in Europe. The Nazi–Soviet Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact was signed the day Hergé delivered the book&#x27;s remaining drawings; finishing touches included the book&#x27;s original front cover, the royal coat of arms for the title page, and the tapestry depicting the Syldavian&#x27;s 1127 victory over the Turks in &quot;The Battle of Zileheroum&quot; on page 20. Hergé suggested that for this publication, the story&#x27;s title be changed to &quot;The Scepter of Ottokar IV&quot;; Casterman changed this to &quot;King Ottokar&#x27;s Sceptre&quot;.

&quot;King Ottokar&#x27;s Sceptre&quot; introduced the recurring character of Bianca Castafiore to the series, who appears alongside her pianist Igor Wagner. It also witnessed the introduction of antagonist Colonel Jorgen, who reappears in the later Tintin adventures &quot;Destination Moon&quot; and its sequel &quot;Explorers on the Moon&quot;. The Alembick brothers&#x27; inclusion echoes the Balthazar brothers&#x27; inclusion in &quot;The Broken Ear&quot;.

After the conclusion of &quot;King Ottokar&#x27;s Sceptre&quot;, Hergé continued &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; with &quot;Land of Black Gold&quot; until Germany placed Belgium under occupation in 1940 and forced the closure of . The adventure &quot;Land of Black Gold&quot; had to be abandoned.

===Second version, 1947===
The story was redrawn and colourised in 1947. For this edition, Hergé was assisted by Edgar P. Jacobs. Jacobs oversaw changes to the costumes and background of the story; in the 1938 version, the Syldavian Royal Guards are dressed like British Beefeaters, while the 1947 version has them dressed in a Balkanised uniform similar to the National Guards Unit of Bulgaria. Jacobs also inserted a cameo of himself and his wife in the Syldavian royal court, while in that same scene is a cameo of Hergé, his then-wife Germaine, his brother Paul, and three of his friends – Édouard Cnaepelinckx, Jacques Van Melkebeke, and Marcel Stobbaerts. Hergé and Jacobs also inserted further cameos of themselves at the bottom of page 38, where they appear as uniformed officers. While the character of Professor Alembick had been given the forename of Nestor in the original version, this was changed to Hector for the second; this had been done so as to avoid confusion with the character of Nestor, the butler of Marlinspike Hall, whom Hergé had introduced in &quot;The Secret of the Unicorn&quot;. Editions Casterman published this second version in book form in 1947.

===Subsequent publications and legacy===
&quot;King Ottokar&#x27;s Sceptre&quot; became the first Tintin adventure to be published for a British audience when &quot;Eagle&quot; serialised the comic in 1951. Here, the names of Tintin and Milou were retained, although the characters of Dupond and Dupont were renamed Thomson and Thompson; the latter two names would be adopted by translators Leslie Lonsdale-Cooper and Michael Turner when they translated the series into English for Methuen Publishing in 1958.

Casterman republished the original black-and-white version of the story in 1980, as part of the fourth volume in their collection. In 1988, they then published a facsimile version of that first edition.

==Critical analysis==

Harry Thompson described &quot;King Ottokar&#x27;s Sceptre&quot; as a &quot;biting political satire&quot; and asserted that it was &quot;courageous&quot; of Hergé to have written it given that the threat of Nazi invasion was imminent. Describing it as a &quot;classic locked room mystery&quot;, he praised its &quot;tightly constructed plot&quot;. Ultimately, he deemed it one of the best three Tintin adventures written before World War II, alongside &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot; and &quot;The Black Island&quot;. He also thought it noteworthy that in 1976, archaeologists discovered a sceptre belonging to a 13th-century King Ottokar in St. Vitus Cathedral, Prague. Hergé biographer Pierre Assouline believed that the story had the atmosphere of Franz Lehár&#x27;s &quot;The Merry Widow&quot;, with &quot;added touches&quot; from the films of Erich von Stroheim and Ernst Lubitsch. Fellow biographer Benoît Peeters thought that it exhibited &quot;a political maturity&quot; and &quot;originality&quot;. Further, he felt that Hergé was able to break free from the &quot;narrative limits [of] ... too much realism&quot; by the use of Syldavia as a setting.

Jean-Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier called &quot;King Ottokar&#x27;s Sceptre&quot; &quot;a Hitchcockian thriller&quot; which &quot;recaptures the paranoid ambience&quot; of &quot;Cigars of the Pharaoh&quot;. They compared the pace of the latter part of the story to that of Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; films before noting that despite the &quot;horrors of the real world&quot; that are present with Borduria&#x27;s inclusion, they do not interfere in &quot;the pure escapist nature of the adventure&quot;. Ultimately they awarded it three stars out of five.

Michael Farr opined that the adventure has &quot;a convincingly authentic feel&quot; due to the satirical portrayal to Nazi Germany, but that this was coupled with &quot;sufficient scope for invention&quot; with the creation of Syldavia. He compared it to Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;The Lady Vanishes&quot;. Farr preferred the colour version assembled with E.P. Jacobs&#x27; aid, however. Deeming it &quot;particularly successful&quot;, he thought that it was &quot;one of the most polished and accomplished&quot; adventures in the series, with a &quot;perfectly paced and balanced&quot; narrative that mixed drama and comedy successfully.

Literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolidès of Stanford University asserted that the inclusion of the Iron Guard evoked Colonel François de La Rocque&#x27;s Croix-de-Feu. Noting that the figure of Müsstler was &quot;the Evil One without a face&quot;, he expressed disbelief regarding Hergé&#x27;s depiction of Syldavia, as there were no apparent economic problems or reasons why Müsstler&#x27;s anti-monarchist conspiracy was so strong; thus, &quot;mass revolution remains schematic&quot;.

Literary critic Tom McCarthy identified several instances in the story that he argued linked to wider themes within the &quot;Adventures of Tintin&quot;. He identified a recurring host-and-guest theme in Alembick&#x27;s visit to Syldavia, and believed that the theme of thieving was present in the story as Alembick&#x27;s identity is stolen. Another theme identified within the series by McCarthy was that of the blurring between the sacred and the political; he saw echoes of this in &quot;King Ottokar&#x27;s Sceptre&quot; as the King has to wait three days before appearing to the Syldavian public on St. Vladimir&#x27;s Day, something that McCarthy thought linked to Jesus Christ and the Resurrection. McCarthy also opined that a number of characters in the book visually resembled Captain Haddock, a character who would be introduced in the subsequent Tintin adventure, &quot;The Crab with the Golden Claws&quot;.

==Adaptations==
&quot;King Ottokar&#x27;s Sceptre&quot; was the first of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; to be adapted for the animated series &quot;Hergé&#x27;s Adventures of Tintin&quot;. The series was created by Belgium&#x27;s Belvision Studios in 1957, directed by Ray Goossens and written by Greg. The studio divided &quot;King Ottokar&#x27;s Sceptre&quot; into six 5-minute black-and-white episodes that diverged from Hergé&#x27;s original plot in many ways. It was also adapted into a 1991 episode of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; television series by French studio Ellipse and Canadian animation company Nelvana. The episode was directed by Stéphane Bernasconi, and Thierry Wermuth voiced the character of Tintin.

Tintin fans adopted the Syldavian language that appears in the story and used it to construct grammars and dictionaries, akin to the fan following of &quot;Star Trek&quot;&#x27;s Klingon and J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s Elvish.

<text>The Red Sea Sharks () is the nineteenth volume of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, the comic series by Belgian cartoonist Hergé. The story was initially serialised weekly in Belgium&#x27;s &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine from October 1956 to January 1958 before being published in a collected volume by Casterman in 1958. The narrative follows the young reporter Tintin, his dog Snowy, and his friend Captain Haddock as they travel to the fictional Middle Eastern kingdom of Khemed with the intention of aiding the Emir Ben Kalish Ezab in regaining control after a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; by his enemies, who are financed by slave traders led by Tintin&#x27;s old nemesis Rastapopoulos.

Following on from the previous volume in the series, &quot;The Calculus Affair&quot;, &quot;The Red Sea Sharks&quot; was created with the aid of Hergé&#x27;s team of artists at Studios Hergé. Influenced by Honoré de Balzac&#x27;s &quot;The Human Comedy&quot;, Hergé used the story as a vehicle in which to reintroduce a wide range of characters who had first appeared in earlier instalments of the series. The story dealt with the trade of enslaved Africans across the Arab world, specifically the Red Sea slave trade, which was ongoing at the time of its publication. However, in the 1960s the story generated controversy as Hergé was repeatedly accused of having portrayed the Africans in a racist manner. He was upset by these claims, and made alterations to the depiction of the Africans in later reprints. Hergé continued &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; with &quot;Tintin in Tibet&quot;, and the series as a whole became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. &quot;The Red Sea Sharks&quot; was critically well-received, with various commentators describing it as one of the best Tintin adventures. The story was adapted for both the 1991 Ellipse/Nelvana animated series &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; and the 1992-3 BBC Radio 5 dramatisation of the &quot;Adventures&quot;.

==Synopsis==
In Brussels, Tintin and Captain Haddock bump into an old acquaintance, General Alcazar. Returning to Marlinspike Hall, they find that another acquaintance, the Emir of Khemed, Mohammed Ben Kalish Ezab, has been overthrown by his nemesis Sheikh Bab El Ehr, and that the Emir has accordingly sent his son, the disobedient Abdullah, to stay at Marlinspike for his own protection. The police detectives Thomson and Thompson visit, informing Tintin that Alcazar is seeking to purchase military aircraft from J. M. Dawson. After further investigation, Tintin discovers that Dawson has also sold military aircraft to Bab El Ehr. 

Realising that the only way to be rid of Abdullah is to restore the Emir&#x27;s control of Khemed, Tintin, Haddock, and their dog Snowy travel to the Middle Eastern country. However, the trio narrowly survive a bomb planted aboard the plane to kill them as a result of Dawson discovering that Tintin spied on him. Meanwhile, a fight breaks out between Haddock, the angry man and Tintin. The pilot had ordered to make an emergency crash landing. With the fire now extinguished and the evacuation of passengers from a burning plane, the trio are able to slip into the city of Wadeshah unobserved. There they meet an old friend, the Portuguese merchant Oliveira da Figueira, who helps them to escape the city and ride on horseback to the Emir&#x27;s hideout. During the journey, they evade armoured cars and fighter planes ordered to intercept them by &quot;Mull Pasha&quot;, who is actually Tintin&#x27;s old nemesis, Dr. Müller. 

Meanwhile back at Marlinspike Hall, Abdullah finds Nestor who is bound and gagged into a chair in a kitchen and Professor Calculus later turns up while roller-skating. Later, the Emir welcomes Tintin and Haddock. It then transpires, from the Emir&#x27;s explanation, that there is an ongoing slave trade through Khemed that is operated by the international businessman called &quot;the Marquis di Gorgonzola&quot;, who falsely offers transport to African Muslims on the pilgrimage to Mecca, but then sells them into slavery somewhere along the journey. Tintin, Haddock and Snowy leave for the Red Sea coast and board a sambuk for Mecca, but are attacked by fighter planes. Tintin shoots one down and rescues its mercenary Estonian pilot, Piotr Skut. The four are picked up by di Gorgonzola&#x27;s yacht, the &quot;Scheherazade&quot;, but are soon offloaded onto the SS &quot;Ramona&quot;, a tramp steamer. Di Gorgonzola, it turns out, is another of Tintin&#x27;s previous adversaries, Roberto Rastapopoulos.

The &quot;Ramona&quot; is one of Rastapopoulos&#x27; slave trading ships, and when a fire breaks out aboard it during the night, the ship&#x27;s commander Allan and his crew cowardly flee, leaving Tintin, Haddock, Snowy and Skut aboard along with a consignment of African slaves. With Haddock taking on the ship&#x27;s captaincy, they are successfully able to put out the fire. However, Rastapopoulos orders a U-boat to destroy the &quot;Ramona&quot;, with the ship taking evasive manoeuvres to survive, ultimately being rescued by a fighter from the cruiser USS &quot;Los Angeles&quot; after Tintin dispatches numerous distress calls. The &quot;Los Angeles&quot; chases down the &quot;Scheherazade&quot; and attempts to capture di Gorgonzola, but he fakes his own death and escapes via a mini-submarine. Tintin, Haddock and Snowy return to Belgium and learn that the Emir has recaptured Khemed and with the war now over at Khemed so that Abdullah can return home. Their relaxation is cut short by insurance salesman Jolyon Wagg, who has arranged to use Marlinspike for an auto rally.

==History==
===Background and publication===
Hergé was inspired to develop the plot for &quot;The Red Sea Sharks&quot; after reading a magazine article detailing the continued existence of the slave trade within the Arab world, in which it was claimed that African pilgrims headed to Mecca were being enslaved during the journey. 
One of the routes that supplied the Red Sea slave trade where hajj pilgrims, and the Red Sea Slave trade was still ongoing in the 1950s, slavery in Saudi Arabia and in Yemen being banned in 1962, slavery in Dubai in 1963 and in Oman in 1970. Hergé included a reference to this slave trade in the story&#x27;s original French title, &quot;Coke en Stock&quot; (&quot;Coke on Board&quot;), which referred to the slave smuggler&#x27;s use of &quot;coke&quot; as a codeword for the enslaved people. 

Before writing the story, Hergé had read &quot;Balzac et son monde&quot; (&quot;Balzac and His World&quot;), a 1955 book written by his friend Félicien Marceau. Intrigued by the work of Honoré de Balzac, Hergé was inspired by how Balzac kept reusing characters from his previous stories and he subsequently adopted this trait for &quot;The Red Sea Sharks&quot;, in which a wide range of characters from &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; make a reappearance. Hergé also introduced a new character, the Estonian pilot Piotr Skut, who would later reappear in &quot;Flight 714 to Sydney&quot;.

To produce accurate illustrations for the &quot;Ramona&quot;, Hergé and his assistant Bob de Moor travelled aboard a Swedish cargo vessel, the MS &quot;Reine Astrid&quot;, from Antwerp to Gothenburg and back, during which they took photographs and drew sketches. Hergé had also collected press clippings depicting the &quot;Christina&quot;, a motor yacht owned by the Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis, and used them as the basis for his depiction of Rastapopoulos&#x27; ship, the &quot;Sheherezade&quot;.
The aircraft, cars, and machinery that appear in the story were drawn by Roger Leloup, one of the members of the Studios Hergé. In one scene in the latter part of the story, Hergé included a 
frogman, whose depiction was drawn from a press clipping of Lionel Crabb. His depiction of the Emir&#x27;s hideaway palace cut from the rock was based on the Al Khazneh in Petra, Jordan, which he had seen in an issue of &quot;National Geographic&quot;.

Hergé&#x27;s growing interest in art was reflected in the story, as he included a copy of Alfred Sisley&#x27;s &quot;Le Canal du Loing&quot; at Marlinspike Hall. He also included paintings by Pablo Picasso and Joan Miró aboard Rastapopolous&#x27; &quot;Scheherazade&quot;. Muller&#x27;s pseudonym in the story, Mull Pasha, was based upon the British soldier Glubb Pasha. The character of Piotr Skut was based on , an Estonian pilot who escaped to Sweden from Estonia in an Arado floatplane. In the final scene, Hergé included cameos of both himself and his friend and colleague Edgar P. Jacobs. 

The story began serialisation in Belgium&#x27;s &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine in October 1956, before being serialised in the French edition of the magazine in December. It was then published in book form by Casterman in 1958. Upon the story&#x27;s British publication in 1960, &quot;Coke en Stock&quot; was renamed &quot;The Red Sea Sharks&quot;.

===Racism allegations and alterations===
Hergé had been accused of exhibiting a racist attitude toward Africans in an earlier story, &quot;Tintin in the Congo&quot;, and potentially hoped to exonerate himself from such criticism by depicting Tintin and Haddock freeing African slaves in &quot;The Red Sea Sharks&quot;. In preparing the latter story he had consulted a colleague who worked for an African-themed magazine, &quot;L&#x27;Afrique et le Monde&quot; (&quot;Africa and the World&quot;); they translated some of the passages that Hergé wished to include in the story into Yoruba. However, in January 1962 an article in the magazine &quot;Jeune Afrique&quot; criticised Hergé for a racist depiction of Africans in the story, an accusation that would be echoed in other publications. These claims focused on the African characters&#x27; simplistic use of pidgin language, which was similar to the speech patterns used in &quot;Tintin in the Congo&quot;.

:African: &quot;You speak well, Effendi. Wicked Arab, very wicked. Poor black men do not want to be slaves. Poor black men want to go to Mecca&quot;.
:Haddock: &quot;Naturally, I realise that. But I repeat if you go there, you&#x27;ll be sold as slaves. Is that what you want?&quot;
:African: &quot;We not slaves, Effendi. We good Muslims. We want to go to Mecca&quot;.

Hergé biographer Benoît Peeters expressed the view that &quot;for the most part these attacks were extremely unfair&quot;.
Hergé was emotionally affected by the accusations, and made changes to the book for its 1967 reprint accordingly; here he changed the Africans&#x27; speech patterns, giving them improved grammar.
However, he left Haddock speaking pidgin in response to the Africans. 

For this version, he also made changes to the Emir&#x27;s letter to Tintin; the former version had been formal in its prose, saying &quot;Most esteemed and well-beloved friend, I entrust to you my son Abdullah, to improve his English. Here the situation is serious. Should any misfortune befall me I count on you, my friend, to care for Abdullah&quot;. In Hergé&#x27;s revised edition, he adopts a more florid prose style: &quot;This is to tell you, oh highly esteemed friend, that I entrusted to you Abdullah, my adored son. Because here the situation is serious. Should misfortune descend on me like the hawk on an innocent gazelle (for the world is made of life and death) I am sure that Abdullah will find you with warmth and affection, refuge and peace. And in doing this you will be performing a fragrant act before Allah&quot;.

Hergé also expressed regret that he depicted the death of a shark in the story, later stating that &quot;I still believed that sharks were big evil beasts&quot; when writing &quot;The Red Sea Sharks&quot;.

==Critical analysis==
Commenting on the inclusion of a wide range of characters from &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, Harry Thompson referred to the story as &quot;a Tintin family reunion&quot;, commenting that it was &quot;a story unusually full of the type of people Captain Haddock liked to avoid&quot;. Michael Farr believed that in reviving so many older characters, Hergé had given &quot;The Red Sea Sharks&quot; &quot;a marked retrospective quality&quot;. Jean-Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier felt that the &quot;crowded&quot; nature of the story left little room for series regulars Professor Calculus or Thomson and Thompson, and resulted in the new character of Skut serving only as &quot;a nice supporting character, but nothing more&quot;. The Lofficiers stated that &quot;Hergé was doing some house-cleaning of his past works and characters before embarking on something more serious and with more personal resonance&quot;, &quot;Tintin in Tibet&quot;.

Hergé biographer Benoît Peeters described &quot;The Red Sea Sharks&quot; as a &quot;complex, ambiguous, even labyrinthine&quot; story which was &quot;undoubtedly the book in which Hergé ventured furthest into the creation of his own universe&quot;. He thought that &quot;Hergé enters a new phase&quot; with &quot;The Red Sea Sharks&quot;, as its author &quot;seems to know his family of characters better and better, and he enjoys playing with them and his reader&quot;. Peeters noted that the book was &quot;in some respects a continuation&quot; of &quot;Land of Black Gold&quot;, an assessment shared by Thompson, the Lofficiers, and Farr, all of whom described it as a partial sequel to the earlier book. Thompson added that &quot;The Red Sea Sharks&quot; &quot;atoned for the relative failure&quot; of &quot;Land of Black Gold&quot;, believing that although it had a &quot;rather hasty finish&quot;, it was &quot;a first-rate thriller&quot;. The Lofficiers awarded it four out of five, stating that it was &quot;very effective as a modern political thriller and far more believable than &quot;The Calculus Affair&quot;&quot;. They also opined that it provided an effective political commentary on the West&#x27;s relationship with the Arab world. In their analysis, Tintin and Haddock seek to aid the Emir not because he is a good leader, but for their own selfish purposes (to get Abdullah out of Marlinspike), just as Western governments and corporations build alliances with Arab leaders guilty of human rights abuses in order to benefit their own interests.

Thompson felt that the inclusion of slavery as a key theme led to this book being &quot;one of Hergé&#x27;s more adult-oriented adventures&quot;. Nevertheless, Farr noted that the story contained &quot;a good measure of humour&quot; to balance out these darker elements. Farr drew comparisons with Anthony Powell&#x27;s &quot;A Dance to the Music of Time&quot;, a series of novels that was contemporary to &quot;The Red Sea Sharks&quot; and which was similarly inspired by Balzac&#x27;s &quot;The Human Comedy&quot;. Hergé biographer Pierre Assouline believed that &quot;The Red Sea Sharks&quot; represented &quot;the culmination of his golden age&quot;, which had begun with &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot;. He also commented that &quot;it almost seemed as if Hergé had regained the pace and rhythm of his most creative period&quot; with this story.

In his psychoanalytical study of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, the literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolidès expressed the view that &quot;The Red Sea Sharks&quot; reflected a world in which traditional values have been degraded and everything – including human life – has become a commodity. He added that Rastapopoulos becomes &quot;the embodiment of the global market&quot; in this story, tying together all of the other characters and therefore replacing Tintin as the figure &quot;at the centre of the universe&quot;. Apostolidès opined that &quot;The Red Sea Sharks&quot; amplifies &quot;the theme of the general equivalence of everything&quot; that is present in the series, serving as &quot;a kind of retrospective&quot; by introducing old characters and establishing new relationships between them. He believed that the theme of the mirage pervaded the story, appearing repeatedly in such forms as Abdullah&#x27;s cuckoo clock which concealed a water squirter and the pseudonyms employed by the various characters throughout the narrative. The literary critic Tom McCarthy stated that &quot;The Red Sea Sharks&quot; exhibited a number of themes that recurred throughout &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;. He believed that a scene in which one of Bab El Ehr&#x27;s men spies on the Emir in his mountain hideaway reflected a wider theme of eavesdropping that features throughout the series. McCarthy also highlighted Tintin&#x27;s actions in returning Abdullah to Khemed, expressing the view that it is part of a wider running theme throughout the series in which the hero takes abandoned children to their home; other instances included Tintin&#x27;s discovery of an adoptive family for the orphan Chang Chong-Chen in &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot; and the delivery of the lost gypsy child Miarka to her family in &quot;The Castafiore Emerald&quot;.

== Adaptations ==
In 1991, a collaboration between the French studio Ellipse and the Canadian animation company Nelvana adapted 21 of the stories – among them &quot;The Red Sea Sharks&quot; – into a series of episodes, each 42 minutes long. Directed by Stéphane Bernasconi, the series has been praised for being &quot;generally faithful&quot;, with compositions having been actually directly taken from the panels in the original comic book.

<doc id="54938" wikidata="Q44269" url="?curid=54938" title="Saint Nicholas">
<text>Saint Nicholas of Myra (traditionally 15 March 270 – 6 December 343), also known as Nicholas of Bari, was an early Christian bishop of Greek descent from the maritime city of Patara in Anatolia (in modern-day Antalya Province, Turkey) during the time of the Roman Empire. Because of the many miracles attributed to his intercession, he is also known as Nicholas the Wonderworker. Saint Nicholas is the patron saint of sailors, merchants, archers, repentant thieves, children, brewers, pawnbrokers, toymakers, unmarried people, and students in various cities and countries around Europe. His reputation evolved among the pious, as was common for early Christian saints, and his legendary habit of secret gift-giving gave rise to the folklore of [[Santa Claus]] (&quot;Saint Nick&quot;) through Sinterklaas.

Little is known about the historical Saint Nicholas. The earliest accounts of his life were written centuries after his death and probably contain legendary elaborations. He is said to have been born in the Anatolian seaport of Patara, Lycia, in Asia Minor to wealthy Christian parents. In one of the earliest attested and most famous incidents from his life, he is said to have rescued three girls from being forced into prostitution by dropping a sack of gold coins through the window of their house each night for three nights so their father could pay a dowry for each of them. Other early stories tell of him calming a storm at sea, saving three innocent soldiers from wrongful execution, and chopping down a tree possessed by a demon. In his youth, he is said to have made a pilgrimage to Egypt and Syria Palaestina. Shortly after his return, he became Bishop of Myra. He was later cast into prison during the persecution of Diocletian, but was released after the accession of Constantine.

An early list makes him an attendee at the First Council of Nicaea in 325, but he is never mentioned in any writings by people who were at the council. Late, unsubstantiated legends claim that he was temporarily defrocked and imprisoned during the council for slapping the heretic Arius. Another famous late legend tells how he resurrected three children, who had been murdered and pickled in brine by a butcher planning to sell them as pork during a famine.

Fewer than 200 years after Nicholas&#x27;s death, the St. Nicholas Church was built in Myra under the orders of Theodosius II over the site of the church where he had served as bishop, and his remains were moved to a sarcophagus in that church. In 1087, while the Greek Christian inhabitants of the region were subjugated by the newly arrived Muslim Seljuk Turks, and soon after the beginning of the East–West schism, a group of merchants from the Italian city of Bari removed the major bones of Nicholas&#x27;s skeleton from his sarcophagus in the church without authorization and brought them to their hometown, where they are now enshrined in the Basilica di San Nicola. The remaining bone fragments from the sarcophagus were later removed by Venetian sailors and taken to Venice during the First Crusade.

== Biographical sources ==
Very little is known about Saint Nicholas&#x27;s historical life. Any writings Nicholas himself may have produced have been lost and he is not mentioned by any contemporary chroniclers. This is not surprising, since Nicholas lived during a turbulent time in Roman history. The earliest mentions of Saint Nicholas indicate that, by the sixth century, his following was already well-established. Less than two hundred years after Saint Nicholas&#x27;s probable death, the Eastern Roman Emperor Theodosius II (ruled 401–450) ordered the building of the Church of Saint Nicholas in Myra, which thereby preserves an early mention of his name. The Byzantine historian Procopius also mentions that the Emperor Justinian I (ruled 527–565) renovated churches in Constantinople dedicated to Saint Nicholas and Saint Priscus, which may have originally been built as early as 490.

Nicholas&#x27;s name also occurs as &quot;Nicholas of Myra of Lycia&quot; on the tenth line of a list of attendees at the Council of Nicaea included by Theodore Lector in the &quot;Historiae Ecclesiasticae Tripartitae Epitome&quot;, written sometime between 510 and 515. A single, offhand mention of Nicholas of Myra also occurs in the biography of another saint, Saint Nicholas of Sion, who apparently took the name &quot;Nicholas&quot; to honor him. &quot;The Life of Saint Nicholas of Sion&quot;, written around 250 years after Nicholas of Myra&#x27;s death, briefly mentions Nicholas of Sion visiting Nicholas&#x27;s tomb to pay homage to him. According to Jeremy Seal, the fact that Nicholas had a tomb that could be visited serves as the almost solitary definitive proof that he was a real historical figure.

In his treatise &quot;De statu animarum post mortem&quot; (written 583), the theologian Eustratius of Constantinople cites Saint Nicholas of Myra&#x27;s miracle of the three generals as evidence that souls may work independent from the body. Eustratius credits a lost &quot;Life of Saint Nicholas&quot; as his source. Nearly all the sources Eustratius references date from the late fourth century to early fifth century, indicating the &quot;Life of Saint Nicholas&quot; to which he refers was probably written during this time period, shortly after Nicholas&#x27;s death. The earliest complete account of Nicholas&#x27;s life that has survived to the present is a &quot;Life of Saint Nicholas&quot;, written in the early ninth century by Michael the Archimandrite (814–842), nearly 500 years after Nicholas&#x27;s probable death.

Despite its extremely late date, Michael the Archimandrite&#x27;s &quot;Life of Saint Nicholas&quot; is believed to heavily rely on older written sources and oral traditions. The identity and reliability of these sources, however, remains uncertain. Catholic historian D. L. Cann and medievalist Charles W. Jones both consider Michael the Archimandrite&#x27;s &quot;Life&quot; the only account of Saint Nicholas that is likely to contain any historical truth. Jona Lendering, a Dutch historian of classical antiquity, notes that Michael the Archimandrite&#x27;s &quot;Life&quot; does not contain a &quot;conversion narrative&quot;, which was unusual for saints&#x27; lives of the period when it was written. He therefore argues that it is possible Michael the Archimandrite may have been relying on a source written before conversion narratives became popular, which would be a positive indication of that source&#x27;s reliability. He notes that many of the stories recounted by Michael the Archimandrite closely resemble stories told about the first-century AD Neopythagorean philosopher Apollonius of Tyana in the &quot;Life of Apollonius of Tyana&quot;, an eight-volume biography of him written in the early third century by the Greek writer Philostratus. It was not unusual for Christian saints to adapt older stories of pagan cults. As Apollonius&#x27;s hometown of Tyana was not far from Myra, Lendering contends that many popular stories about Apollonius may have become attached to Saint Nicholas.

== Life and legends ==
=== Family and background ===
Accounts of Saint Nicholas&#x27;s life agree on the essence of his story, but modern historians disagree regarding how much of this story is actually rooted in historical fact. Traditionally, Nicholas was born in the city of Patara (Lycia et Pamphylia), a port on the Mediterranean Sea, in Asia Minor in the Roman Empire, to a wealthy family of Greek Christians. According to some accounts, his parents were named Epiphanius (, ) and Johanna (, ), but, according to others, they were named Theophanes (, ) and Nonna (, ). In some accounts, Nicholas&#x27;s uncle was the bishop of the city of Myra, also in Lycia. Recognizing his nephew&#x27;s calling, Nicholas&#x27;s uncle ordained him as a priest.

=== Generosity and travels ===

After his parents died from an epidemic, Nicholas is said to have distributed their wealth to the poor. In his most famous exploit, which is first attested in Michael the Archimandrite&#x27;s &quot;Life of Saint Nicholas&quot;, Nicholas heard of a devout man who had once been wealthy but had lost all of his money due to the &quot;plotting and envy of Satan.&quot; The man could not afford proper dowries for his three daughters. This meant that they would remain unmarried and probably, in absence of any other possible employment, be forced to become prostitutes. Hearing of the girls&#x27; plight, Nicholas decided to help them, but, being too modest to help the family in public (or to save them the humiliation of accepting charity), he went to the house under the cover of night and threw a purse filled with gold coins through the window opening into the house. The father immediately arranged a marriage for his first daughter, and after her wedding, Nicholas threw a second bag of gold through the same window late at night.

According to Michael the Archimandrite&#x27;s account, after the second daughter was married, the father stayed awake for at least two &quot;nights&quot; and caught Saint Nicholas in the same act of charity toward the third daughter. The father fell on his knees, thanking him, and Nicholas ordered him not to tell anyone about the gifts. The scene of Nicholas&#x27;s secret gift-giving is one of the most popular scenes in Christian devotional art, appearing in icons and frescoes from across Europe. Although depictions vary depending on time and place, Nicholas is often shown wearing a cowl while the daughters are typically shown in bed, dressed in their nightclothes. Many renderings contain a cypress tree or a cross-shaped cupola.

The historicity of this incident is disputed. Adam C. English argues for a historical kernel to the legend, noting the story&#x27;s early attestation as well as the fact that no similar stories were told about any other Christian saints. Jona Lendering, who also argues for the story&#x27;s authenticity, notes that a similar story is told in Philostratus&#x27;s &quot;Life of Apollonius of Tyana&quot;, in which Apollonius gives money to an impoverished father but posits that Michael the Archimandrite&#x27;s account is markedly different. Philostratus does not mention the fate of the daughters and, in his story, Apollonius&#x27;s generosity is purely motivated out of sympathy for the father; in Michael the Archimandrite&#x27;s account, however, Saint Nicholas is instead expressly stated to be motivated by a desire to save the daughters from being sold into prostitution. He argues that this desire to help women is most characteristic of fourth-century Christianity, due to the prominent role women played in the early Christian movement, rather than Greco-Roman paganism or the Christianity of Michael the Archimandrite&#x27;s time in the ninth century, by which point the position of women had drastically declined.

Nicholas is also said to have visited the Holy Land. The ship he was on was nearly destroyed by a terrible storm but he rebuked the waves, causing the storm to subside. Thus, Nicholas became venerated as the patron saint of sailors and travelers.

While in Palestine, Nicholas is said to have lived in a crypt near Bethlehem, where the Nativity of Jesus is believed to have taken place. Over the crypt where Nicholas is believed to have lived now stands the &quot;Church of Saint Nicholas&quot; in Beit Jala, a Christian town of which Nicholas is the Patron saint.

===Bishop of Myra===

After visiting the Holy Land, Nicholas returned to Myra. The bishop of Myra, who had succeeded Nicholas&#x27;s uncle, had recently died and the priests in the city had decided that the first priest to enter the church that morning would be made bishop. Nicholas went to the church to pray and was therefore proclaimed the new bishop. He is said to have been imprisoned and tortured during the Great Persecution under the Emperor Diocletian (ruled 284–305), but was released under the orders of the Emperor Constantine the Great (ruled 306–337). This story sounds plausible, but is not attested in the earliest sources and is therefore unlikely to be historical.

One of the earliest attested stories of Saint Nicholas is one in which he saves three innocent men from execution. According to Michael the Archimandrite, three innocent men were condemned to death by the governor Eustathius. As they were about to be executed, Nicholas appeared, pushed the executioner&#x27;s sword to the ground, released them from their chains, and angrily chastised a juror who had accepted a bribe. According to Jona Lendering, this story directly parallels an earlier story in Philostratus&#x27;s &quot;Life of Apollonius of Tyana&quot;, in which Apollonius prevents the execution of a man falsely condemned of banditry. Michael the Archimandrite also tells another story in which the consul Ablabius accepted a bribe to put three famous generals to death, in spite of their actual innocence. Saint Nicholas appeared to Constantine and Ablabius in dreams, informing Constantine of the truth and frightening Ablabius into releasing the generals, for fear of Hell.

Later versions of the story are more elaborate, interweaving the two stories together. According to one version, Emperor Constantine sent three of his most trusted generals, named Ursos, Nepotianos, and Herpylion, to put down a rebellion in Phrygia. However, a storm forced them to take refuge in Myra. Unbeknownst to the generals, who were in the harbor, their soldiers further inland were fighting with local merchants and engaging in looting and destruction. Nicholas confronted the generals for allowing their soldiers to misbehave and the generals brought an end to the looting. Immediately after the soldiers had returned to their ships, Nicholas heard word of the three innocent men about to be executed and the three generals aided him in stopping the execution. Eustathius attempted to flee on his horse but Nicholas stopped his horse and chastised him for his corruption. Eustathius, under the threat of being reported directly to the Emperor, repented of his corrupt ways. Afterward, the generals succeeded in ending the rebellion and were promoted by Constantine to even higher status. The generals&#x27; enemies, however, slandered them to the consul Ablabius, telling him that they had not really put down the revolt, but instead encouraged their own soldiers to join it. The generals&#x27; enemies also bribed Ablabius and he had the three generals imprisoned. Nicholas then made his dream appearances and the three generals were set free.

=== Council of Nicaea ===
In 325, Nicholas is said to have attended the First Council of Nicaea, where he is said to have been a staunch opponent of Arianism and a devoted supporter of Trinitarianism, and one of the bishops who signed the Nicene Creed. Nicholas&#x27;s attendance at the Council of Nicaea is attested early by Theodore the Lector&#x27;s list of attendees, which records him as the 151st attendee. However, he is conspicuously never mentioned by Athanasius of Alexandria, the foremost defender of Trinitarianism at the council, who knew all the notable bishops of the period, nor is he mentioned by the historian Eusebius, who was also present at the council. Adam C. English notes that lists of the attendees at Nicaea vary considerably, with shorter lists only including roughly 200 names, but longer lists including around 300. Saint Nicholas&#x27;s name only appears on the longer lists, not the shorter ones. Nicholas&#x27;s name appears on a total of three early lists, one of which, Theodore the Lector, is generally considered to be the most accurate. According to Jona Lendering, there are two main possibilities:
# Nicholas &quot;did not&quot; attend the Council of Nicaea, but someone at an early date was baffled that his name was not listed and so added him to the list. Many scholars tend to favor this explanation.
# Nicholas &quot;did&quot; attend the Council of Nicaea, but, at an early date, someone decided to remove his name from the list, apparently deciding that it was better if no one remembered he had been there.

A later legend, first attested in the fourteenth century, over 1,000 years after Nicholas&#x27;s death, holds that, during the Council of Nicaea, Nicholas lost his temper and slapped &quot;a certain Arian&quot; across the face. On account of this, Constantine revoked Nicholas&#x27;s miter and pallium. Steven D. Greydanus concludes that, because of the story&#x27;s late attestation, it &quot;has no historical value.&quot; Jona Lendering, however, defends the veracity and historicity of the incident, arguing that, as it was embarrassing and reflects poorly on Nicholas&#x27;s reputation, it is inexplicable why later hagiographers would have invented it. Later versions of the legend embellish it, making the heretic Arius himself and having Nicholas punch him rather than merely slapping him with his open hand. In these versions of the story, Nicholas is also imprisoned, but Christ and the Virgin Mary appear to him in his cell. He tells them he is imprisoned &quot;for loving you&quot; and they free him from his chains and restore his vestments. The scene of Nicholas slapping Arius is celebrated in Eastern Orthodox icons and episodes of Saint Nicholas at Nicaea are shown in a series of paintings from the 1660s in the Basilica di San Nicola in Bari.

=== Other reputed miracles ===

One story tells how during a terrible famine, a malicious butcher lured three little children into his house, where he killed them, placing their remains in a barrel to cure, planning to sell them off as ham. Nicholas, visiting the region to care for the hungry, saw through the butcher&#x27;s lies and resurrected the pickled children by making the sign of the cross. Jona Lendering opines that the story is &quot;without any historical value&quot;. Adam C. English notes that the story of the resurrection of the pickled children is a late medieval addition to the legendary biography of Saint Nicholas and that it is not found in any of his earliest &quot;Lives&quot;. Although this story seems bizarre and horrifying to modern audiences, it was tremendously popular throughout the Late Middle Ages and the early modern period, and widely beloved by ordinary folk. It is depicted in stained glass windows, wood panel paintings, tapestries, and frescoes. Eventually, the scene became so widely reproduced that, rather than showing the whole scene, artists began to merely depict Saint Nicholas with three naked children and a wooden barrel at his feet.

According to English, eventually, people who had forgotten or never learned the story began misinterpreting representations of it. That Saint Nicholas was shown with children led people to conclude he was the patron saint of children; meanwhile, the fact that he was shown with a barrel led people to conclude that he was the patron saint of brewers.

According to another story, during a great famine that Myra experienced in 311–312, a ship was in the port at anchor, loaded with wheat for the emperor in Constantinople. Nicholas invited the sailors to unload a part of the wheat to help in the time of need. The sailors at first disliked the request, because the wheat had to be weighed accurately and delivered to the emperor. Only when Nicholas promised them that they would not suffer any loss for their consideration did the sailors agree. When they arrived later in the capital, they made a surprising find: the weight of the load had not changed, although the wheat removed in Myra was enough for two full years and could even be used for sowing.

== Relics ==

=== Gemile ===
It has long been traditionally assumed that Saint Nicholas was originally buried in his home town of Myra, where his relics are later known to have been kept, but some recent archaeological evidence indicates that Saint Nicholas may have originally been entombed in a rock-cut church located at the highest point on the small Turkish island of Gemile, only twenty miles away from his birthplace of Patara. Nicholas&#x27;s name is painted on part of the ruined building. In antiquity, the island was known as &quot;Saint Nicholas Island&quot; and today it is known in Turkish as Gemiler Adasi, meaning &quot;Island of Boats&quot;, in reference to Saint Nicholas&#x27;s traditional role as the patron saint of seafarers.

The church was built in the fourth century, around the time of Nicholas&#x27;s death, and is typical of saints&#x27; shrines from that time period. Nicholas was the only major saint associated with that part of Turkey. The church where historians believe he was originally entombed is at the western end of the great processional way.

=== Myra ===

In the mid-7th century, Gemile was vulnerable to attack by Arab fleets, so Nicholas&#x27;s remains appear to have been moved from the island to the city of Myra, where Nicholas had served as bishop for most of his life. Myra is located roughly east of Gemile and its location further inland made it safer from seafaring Arab forces.

It is said that, in Myra, the relics of Saint Nicholas each year exuded a clear watery liquid which smelled like rose water, called manna, or myrrh, which was believed by the faithful to possess miraculous powers. As it was widely known that all Nicholas&#x27;s relics were at Myra in their sealed sarcophagus, it was rare during this period for forgers of relics to claim to possess those belonging to Saint Nicholas.

A solemn bronze statue of the saint by Russian sculptor Gregory Pototsky was donated by the Russian government in 2000, and was given a prominent place in the square fronting the medieval Church of St Nicholas. In 2005, mayor Süleyman Topçu had the statue replaced by a red-suited plastic Santa Claus statue, because he wanted an image more recognisable to foreign visitors. Protests from the Russian government against this were successful, and the bronze statue was returned (albeit without its original high pedestal) to a corner nearer the church.

On 28 December 2009, the Turkish government announced that it would be formally requesting the return of Saint Nicholas&#x27;s skeletal remains to Turkey from the Italian government.
Turkish authorities asserted that Nicholas himself desired to be buried at his episcopal town, and that his remains were illegally removed from his homeland. In 2017, an archaeological survey at St. Nicholas Church, Demre was reported to have found a temple below the modern church, with excavation work to be done that will allow researchers to determine whether it still holds Nicholas&#x27;s body. A sarcophagus possibly holding his remains was found there in 2024.

=== Bari ===

After the Battle of Manzikert in 1071, the Byzantine Empire temporarily lost control over most of Asia Minor to the invading Seljuk Turks, and so Greek Christians of Myra became subjects of the Turks. At the same time the Catholic Church in the West had declared (in 1054 AD) that the Greek church, the official church of the Byzantine Empire, was in schism. Because of the many wars in the region, some Christians were concerned that access to the tomb might become difficult.

Taking advantage of the confusion and the loss by the Greek Christian community of Myra of its Byzantine imperial protection, in the spring of 1087, Italian sailors from Bari in Apulia seized part of the remains of the saint from his burial church in Myra, over the objections of the Greek Orthodox monks in the church.

Adam C. English describes the removal of the relics from Myra as &quot;essentially a holy robbery&quot; and notes the thieves were not only afraid of being caught or chased after by the locals, but also the power of Saint Nicholas himself. Returning to Bari, they brought the remains with them and cared for them. The remains arrived on 9 May 1087. Two years later, Pope Urban II inaugurated a new church, the Basilica di San Nicola, to Saint Nicholas in Bari. The Pope himself personally placed Nicholas&#x27;s relics into the tomb beneath the altar of the new church. The removal of Saint Nicholas&#x27;s relics from Myra and their arrival in Bari is reliably recorded by multiple chroniclers, including Orderic Vitalis and 9 May continued to be celebrated every year by western Christians as the day of Nicholas&#x27;s &quot;translation&quot;. Eastern Orthodox Christians and the Turks have both long regarded the unauthorized removal of the relics from Myra as a blatant theft, but the people of Bari have instead maintained that it was a rescue mission to save the bones from the Turkish invaders. A legend, shown on the ceiling of the Basilica di San Nicola, holds that Nicholas once visited Bari and predicted that his bones would one day rest there.

Prior to the translation of Nicholas&#x27;s relics to Bari, his following had been known in western Europe, but it had not been extremely popular. In autumn of 1096, Norman and Frankish soldiers mustered in Bari in preparation for the First Crusade. Although the Crusaders generally favored warrior saints, which Saint Nicholas was not, the presence of his relics in Bari made him materially accessible. Nicholas&#x27;s associations with aiding travelers and seafarers also made him a popular choice for veneration. Nicholas&#x27;s veneration by Crusaders helped promote his following throughout western Europe.

After the relics were brought to Bari, they continued to produce &quot;myrrh&quot;, much to the joy of their new owners. Vials of myrrh from his relics have been taken all over the world for centuries, and can still be obtained from his church in Bari. Even up to the present day, a flask of manna is extracted from the tomb of Saint Nicholas every year on 6 December (the Saint&#x27;s feast day) by the clergy of the basilica. The myrrh is collected from a sarcophagus which is located in the basilica vault and could be obtained in the shop nearby. The liquid gradually seeps out of the tomb, but it is unclear whether it originates from the body within the tomb, or from the marble itself; since the town of Bari is a harbour, and the tomb is below sea level, there have been several natural explanations proposed for the manna fluid, including the transfer of seawater to the tomb by capillary action.

In 1966, a vault in the crypt underneath the Basilica di San Nicola was dedicated as an Orthodox chapel with an iconostasis in commemoration of the recent lifting of the anathemas the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches had issued against each other during the Great Schism in 1054.

In May 2017, following talks between Pope Francis and Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill, a portion of the relics of Saint Nicholas in Bari were sent on loan to Moscow. The relic was on display for veneration at Christ the Savior Cathedral before being taken to Saint Petersburg in mid-June prior to returning to Bari. More than a million people lined up in Moscow for a momentary glimpse of the gilded ark holding one of the saint&#x27;s ribs.

=== Venice ===
The sailors from Bari took only the main bones of Nicholas&#x27;s skeleton, leaving all the minor fragments in the grave. The city of Venice had interest in obtaining the remaining fragments of his skeleton. In 1044, they dedicated the San Nicolò al Lido monastery basilica to him on the north end of the Lido di Venezia. According to a single chronicle written by an anonymous monk at this monastery, in 1100, a fleet of Venetian ships accompanied by Bishop Enrico Contarini sailed past Myra on their way to Palestine for the First Crusade. Bishop Enrico insisted for the fleet to turn back and set anchor in Myra. The Venetians took the remaining bones of Saint Nicholas, as well as those of several other bishops of Myra, from the church there, which was only guarded by four Orthodox monks, and brought them to Venice, where they deposited them in the San Nicolò al Lido. This tradition was lent credence in two scientific investigations of the relics in Bari and Venice, which confirmed that the relics in the two cities are anatomically compatible and may belong to the same person. It is said that someone dies every time the bones of Saint Nicholas in Venice are disturbed. The last time the bones were examined was in July 1992.

=== Other locations ===

Because of Nicholas&#x27;s skeleton&#x27;s long confinement in Myra, after it was brought to Bari, the demand for pieces of it rose. Small bones quickly began to disperse across western Europe. The sailors who had transported the bones gave one tooth and two fragments chipped from Nicholas&#x27;s sarcophagus to the Norman knight William Pantulf. Pantulf took these relics to his hometown of Noron in Normandy, where they were placed in the local Church of St. Peter in June 1092. In 1096, the duke of Apulia gave several bones of Saint Nicholas to the count of Flanders, which he then enshrined in the Abbey of Watten. According to legend, in 1101, Saint Nicholas appeared in a vision to a French clerk visiting the shrine at Bari and told him to take one of his bones with him to his hometown of Port, near Nancy. The clerk took a finger bone back with him to Port, where a chapel was built to Saint Nicholas. Port became an important center of devotion in the following of Nicholas and, in the fifteenth century, a church known as the Basilique Saint-Nicolas was built there dedicated to him. The town itself is now known as &quot;Saint Nicolas de Port&quot; in honor of Nicholas.

The clergy at Bari strategically gave away samples of Nicholas&#x27;s bones to promote the following and enhance its prestige. Many of these bones were initially kept in Constantinople, but, after the Sack of Constantinople in 1204 during the Fourth Crusade, these fragments were scattered across western Europe. A hand claimed to belong to Saint Nicholas was kept in the San Nicola in Carcere in Rome. This church, whose name means &quot;Saint Nicholas in Chains&quot;, was built on the site of a former municipal prison. Stories quickly developed about Nicholas himself having been held in that prison. Mothers would come to the church to pray to Saint Nicholas for their jailed sons to be released and repentant criminals would place votive offerings in the church. As a result of this, Nicholas became the patron saint of prisoners and those falsely accused of crimes. An index finger claimed to belong to Saint Nicholas was kept in a chapel along the Ostian Way in Rome. Another finger was held in Ventimiglia in Liguria. Today, many churches in Europe, Russia, and the United States claim to possess small relics, such as a tooth or a finger bone.

An Irish tradition states that the relics of Saint Nicholas are also reputed to have been stolen from Myra by local Norman crusading knights in the twelfth century and buried near Thomastown, County Kilkenny, where a stone slab marks the reputed &quot;Tomb of Saint Nicholas&quot;. According to the Irish antiquarian John Hunt, the tomb probably actually belongs to a local priest from Jerpoint Abbey.

Russian Orthodox Church announced on 22 September 2024 that Holy Myrrhbearers Cathedral in Baku received a part of Nicholas&#x27; relic as a gift.

=== Scientific analysis ===

Whereas the devotional importance of relics and the economics associated with pilgrimages caused the remains of most saints to be divided up and spread over numerous churches in several countries, Saint Nicholas is unusual in that most of his bones have been preserved in one spot: his grave crypt in Bari. Even with the allegedly continuing miracle of the manna, the archdiocese of Bari has allowed for one scientific survey of the bones. In the late 1950s, while the crypt was undergoing much-needed restoration, the bones were removed from it for the first time since their interment in 1089. A special Pontiffical Commission permitted Luigi Martino, a professor of human anatomy at the University of Bari, to examine the bones under the commission&#x27;s supervision. Martino took thousands of measurements, detailed scientific drawings, photographs, and x-rays. These examinations revealed the saint to have died at over seventy years of age and to have been of average height and slender-to-average build. He also suffered from severe chronic arthritis in his spine and pelvis.

In 2004, at the University of Manchester, researchers Caroline Wilkinson and Fraco Introna reconstructed the saint&#x27;s face based on Martino&#x27;s examination. The review of the data revealed that the historical Saint Nicholas was in height and had a broken nose, which had partially healed, revealing that the injury had been suffered &quot;ante mortem&quot;. The broken nose appeared to conform with hagiographical reports that Saint Nicholas had been beaten and tortured during the Diocletianic Persecution. The facial reconstruction was produced by Caroline Wilkinson at the University of Manchester and was shown on a BBC2 TV program &quot;The Real Face of Santa&quot;. In 2014, the Face Lab at Liverpool John Moores University produced an updated reconstruction of Saint Nicholas&#x27;s face.

In 2017, two researchers from Oxford University, Professor Tom Higham and Doctor Georges Kazan, radiocarbon dated a fragment of a pelvis claimed to belong to Saint Nicholas. The fragment originally came from a church in Lyon, France and, at the time of testing, was in the possession of Father Dennis O&#x27;Neill, a priest from St Martha of Bethany Church in Illinois. The results of the radiocarbon dating confirmed that the pelvis dates to the fourth century AD, around the same time that Saint Nicholas would have died, and is not a medieval forgery. The bone was one of the oldest the Oxford team had ever examined.

According to Professor Higham, most of the relics the team has examined turn out to be too recent to have actually belonged to the saint to whom they are attributed, but he states, &quot;This bone fragment, in contrast, suggests that we could possibly be looking at remains from St Nicholas himself.&quot; Kazan believes the pelvis fragment may come from the same individual as the skeleton divided between the churches in Bari and Venice, since the bone they tested comes from the left pubis, and the only pelvis bone in the collection at Bari is the left ilium. In the absence of DNA testing, however, it is not yet possible to know for certain whether the pelvis is from the same man.

== Veneration and celebrations ==

Among Greeks and Italians, Saint Nicholas is a favorite of sailors, fishermen, ships and sailing. As a result, and over time, he has become the patron saint of several cities which maintain harbours. In centuries of Greek folklore, Nicholas was seen as &quot;The Lord of the Sea&quot;, often described by modern Greek scholars as a kind of Christianized version of Poseidon. In modern Greece, he is still easily among the most recognizable saints and 6 December finds many cities celebrating their patron saint. He is also the patron saint of all of Greece and particularly of the Hellenic Navy.
In the Eastern Orthodox Church, Saint Nicholas&#x27;s memory is celebrated on almost every Thursday of the year (together with the Apostles) with special hymns to him which are found in the liturgical book known as the Octoechos. Soon after the transfer of Saint Nicholas&#x27;s relics from Myra to Bari, an East Slavic version of his Life and an account of the transfer of his relics were written by a contemporary to this event.

Devotional akathists and canons have been composed in his honour, and are frequently chanted by the faithful as they ask for his intercession. He is mentioned in the Liturgy of Preparation during the Divine Liturgy (Eastern Orthodox Eucharist) and during the All-Night Vigil. Many Orthodox churches will have his icon, even if they are not named after him. In Oriental Orthodoxy, the Coptic Church observes the Departure of St. Nicholas on 10 Kiahk, or 10 Taḫśaś in Ethiopia, which corresponds to the Julian Calendar&#x27;s 6 December and Gregorian Calendar&#x27;s 19 December.

Nicholas had a reputation for secret gift-giving, such as putting coins in the shoes of those who left them out for him, a practice celebrated on his feast day, 6 December. For those who still observe the Julian calendar the celebration currently takes place thirteen days later than it happens in the Gregorian calendar and Revised Julian calendar.

In Serbia, the most common Slava (annual ceremony and veneration of a Serbian family&#x27;s patron saint) is Saint Nicholas&#x27; day celebrated on 19 December.

In Monaco, the Cathedral of Our Lady Immaculate was built from 1874 on the site of St Nicholas&#x27;s church, founded in 1252. A children&#x27;s Mass is still held on 6 December in the cathedral.
In late medieval England, on Saint Nicholas Day parishes held Christmastide &quot;boy bishop&quot; celebrations. As part of this celebration, youths performed the functions of priests and bishops, and exercised rule over their elders. Today, Saint Nicholas is still celebrated as a great gift-giver in several Western European and Central European countries. In medieval times, Christian nuns in Belgium and France began to deposit baskets of food and clothes anonymously at the doorsteps of the needy, which gave rise to the practice of gift giving on Saint Nicholas Day. According to another source, on 6 December every sailor or ex-sailor of the Low Countries (which at that time was virtually all of the male population) would descend to the harbour towns to participate in a church celebration for their patron saint. On the way back they would stop at one of the various &quot;Nicholas fairs&quot; to buy some hard-to-come-by goods, gifts for their loved ones and invariably some little presents for their children. While the real gifts would only be presented at Christmas, the little presents for the children were given right away, courtesy of Saint Nicholas. This and his miracle of him resurrecting the three butchered children made Saint Nicholas a patron saint of children and later students as well. The custom of giving gifts on Saint Nicholas Day is popular in various parts of Christendom, with a popular tradition including children placing their shoes in the foyer for Saint Nicholas to deliver presents therein.

Santa Claus evolved from Dutch traditions regarding Saint Nicholas (Sinterklaas). When the Dutch established the colony of New Amsterdam, they brought the legend and traditions of Sinterklaas with them. Howard G. Hageman, of New Brunswick Theological Seminary, maintains that the tradition of celebrating Sinterklaas in New York existed in the early settlements of the Hudson Valley, although by the early nineteenth century had fallen by the way. St. Nicholas Avenue and St. Nicholas Terrace, streets in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City, an area originally settled by Dutch farmers, were named for St. Nicholas of Myra. The name later was taken for nearby St. Nicholas Park, located at the intersection of St. Nicholas Avenue and 127th Street.

Nicholas is honored in the calendar of saints of the Lutheran Churches, as well as in Church of England and in the Episcopal Church on 6 December.

== Iconography ==

Saint Nicholas is a popular subject portrayed on Eastern Orthodox icons, particularly Russian and Serbian ones. He is depicted as an Orthodox bishop, wearing the omophorion and holding a Gospel Book. Sometimes he is depicted wearing the Eastern Orthodox mitre, sometimes he is bareheaded. Iconographically, Nicholas is depicted as an elderly man with a short, full, white, fluffy beard and balding head. In commemoration of the miracle attributed to him by tradition at the Council of Nicaea, he is sometimes depicted with Christ over his left shoulder holding out a Gospel Book to him and the Theotokos over his right shoulder holding the omophorion. Because of his patronage of mariners, occasionally Saint Nicholas will be shown standing in a boat or rescuing drowning sailors; Medieval Chants and Polyphony, image on the cover of the Book of Hours of Duke of Berry, 1410.
In depictions of Saint Nicholas from Bari, he is usually shown as dark-skinned, probably to emphasize his foreign origin. The emphasis on his foreignness may have been intended to enhance Bari&#x27;s reputation by displaying that it had attracted the patronage of a saint from a far-off country. In Roman Catholic iconography, Saint Nicholas is depicted as a bishop, wearing the insignia of this dignity: a bishop&#x27;s vestments, a mitre and a crozier. The episode with the three dowries is commemorated by showing him holding in his hand either three purses, three coins or three balls of gold. Depending on whether he is depicted as patron saint of children or sailors, his images will be completed by a background showing ships, children or three figures climbing out of a wooden barrel (the three slaughtered children he resurrected).

In a strange twist, the three gold balls referring to the dowry affair are sometimes metaphorically interpreted as being oranges or other fruits. As in the Low Countries in medieval times oranges most frequently came from Spain, this led to the belief that the Saint lives in Spain and comes to visit every winter bringing them oranges, other &#x27;wintry&#x27; fruits and tales of magical creatures.

== Music ==
In 1948, Benjamin Britten completed a cantata, &quot;Saint Nicolas&quot; on a text by Eric Crozier which covers the saint&#x27;s legendary life in a dramatic sequence of events. A tenor soloist appears as Saint Nicolas, with a mixed choir, boys singers, strings, piano duet, organ and percussion.

<text>Goldwasser or Danziger Goldwasser (lit. &#x27;Gold water from Danzig&#x27;), , with &quot;Goldwasser&quot; as the registered tradename, is a strong (40% ABV) root and herbal liqueur which was produced from 1598 to 2009 in Gdańsk (). Production now takes place in Germany.

The most prominent characteristic of the drink is small flakes of 23 karat gold suspended in it. The beverage also includes herbs and spices such as cardamom, cloves, cinnamon, lavender, thyme, coriander and juniper, and has a syrupy texture.

Alcoholic solutions were used by artists for gilding, which is believed to be the inspiration for the drink. Alchemy, which was at its high point in the late 16th century when Goldwasser appeared, held gold to have many desirable medical properties; while modern medicine disputes this, native gold is known to be non-toxic to humans and to pass through the digestive tract unchanged, unlike most other heavy metals. Since the flakes are extremely small and thin, the price is not prohibitive. When used as a food additive, gold is labelled as E175; see &quot;List of food additives,&quot; Codex Alimentarius.

The drink was invented by a Dutchman from De Lier, Ambrosius Vermeulen who moved to Poland and became a citizen of Danzig on 6 July 1598. In 1704 Ambrosius&#x27; grandson Salomon Vermöllen and his brother-in-law Isaac Wed-Ling moved production to new premises located in the &quot;Breitgasse&quot;. At that time it was common for houses to use animal symbols instead of numbers, and the new factory featured a salmon () on the façade; hence the naming of the brand &quot;Der Lachs zu Danzig&quot;.

During his trip to Western Europe — the so-called Grand Embassy — Russian Tsar Peter I the Great visited the city of Danzig. He founded the official Russian consulate in Danzig and became a great lover of Goldwasser. He ordered permanent delivery of Goldwasser to Russia for himself.

As the Free City of Danzig was separated from Germany after World War I by the Polish corridor, the &quot;Der Lachs&quot; company opened in 1922 an additional factory in Berlin to supply the main part of Germany and international markets with their products &quot;Goldwasser&quot; and &quot;Krambambuli&quot; from there. After 1945, when the city again became part of Poland, only the Berlin factory continued to produce genuine &quot;Danziger Goldwasser&quot;. In 1971 &quot;Der Lachs&quot; was taken over by the Hardenberg-Wilthen distillery and production was moved to the town of Nörten-Hardenberg in West Germany.
It is possible to buy the original brand of &quot;Goldwasser&quot; in the old town of Gdańsk. The original Goldwasser distillery building, though not operational, has been rebuilt as it was before the war, and is now home to the exclusive restaurant &quot;Pod Łososiem&quot; (The Salmon).

Various Polish brands from Gdańsk sell similar drinks called &quot;Gdańska Złotówka&quot; (Gdańsk gold) or &quot;Złota Woda&quot; (Gold water).

Wódka Gdańska is mentioned by the Polish-Lithuanian poet, Adam Mickiewicz, as a drink popular with the Polish nobility.

Legend has it that when King of Poland Sigismund II Augustus visited Danzig in 1549 after his coronation, part of the city&#x27;s homage to the monarch was a gift of Goldwasser, and he is said to have sung the praises of the golden drink often along the rest of his tour.

Another brand of Goldwasser, &quot;Schwabacher Goldwasser&quot;, and other sorts of food embellished with gold, are produced in the city of Schwabach near Nuremberg. Goldschläger is a Swiss cinnamon schnapps which also contains small flakes of 22 karat gold.

Goldwasser is used to flavour Soufflé Rothschild.

<text>Cultural relativism is the view that concepts and moral values must be understood in their own cultural context and not judged according to the standards of a different culture. It asserts the equal validity of all points of view and the relative nature of truth, which is determined by an individual or their culture.

The concept was established by anthropologist Franz Boas, who first articulated the idea in 1887: &quot;civilization is not something absolute, but...is relative, and... our ideas and conceptions are true only so far as our civilization goes&quot;. However, Boas did not use the phrase &quot;cultural relativism&quot;. The concept was spread by Boas&#x27; students, such as Robert Lowie.

The first use of the term recorded in the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; was by philosopher and social theorist Alain Locke in 1924 to describe Lowie&#x27;s &quot;extreme cultural relativism&quot;, found in the latter&#x27;s 1917 book &quot;Culture and Ethnology&quot;. 

The term became common among anthropologists after Boas&#x27; death in 1942, to express their synthesis of a number of ideas he had developed. Boas believed that the sweep of cultures, to be found in connection with any subspecies, is so vast and pervasive that there cannot be a relationship between culture and race. Cultural relativism involves specific epistemological and methodological claims. Whether or not these claims necessitate a specific ethical stance is a matter of debate. Cultural relativism became popularized after World War II in reaction to historical events such as &quot;Nazism, and to colonialism, ethnocentrism and racism more generally.&quot;

==In antiquity==
Herodotus (&quot;Histories&quot; 3.38) observes on the relativity of &quot;mores&quot; (νόμοι):
He mentions an anecdote of Darius the Great who illustrated the principle by inquiring about the funeral customs of the Greeks and the Callatiae, peoples from the extreme western and eastern fringes of his empire, respectively. They practiced cremation and funerary cannibalism, respectively, and were each dismayed and abhorred at the proposition of the other tribes&#x27; practices.

The works of the Pyrrhonist philosopher Sextus Empiricus detail ancient Greek arguments for cultural relativism as part of the tenth of the &quot;Ten Modes&quot; of Aenesidemus.

==As a methodological and heuristic device==
According to George E. Marcus and Michael M. J. Fischer:

Cultural relativism was, in part, a response to Western ethnocentrism. Ethnocentrism may take obvious forms, in which one consciously believes that one&#x27;s people&#x27;s arts are the most beautiful, values the most virtuous, and beliefs the most truthful. Franz Boas, originally trained in physics and geography, and heavily influenced by the thought of Kant, Herder, and von Humboldt, argued that one&#x27;s culture may mediate and thus limit one&#x27;s perceptions in less obvious ways. Boas understood &quot;culture&quot; to include not only certain tastes in food, art, and music, or beliefs about religion; he assumed a much broader notion of culture, defined as:

This view of culture confronts anthropologists with two problems: first, how to escape the unconscious bonds of one&#x27;s own culture, which inevitably bias our perceptions of and reactions to the world, and second, how to make sense of an unfamiliar culture. The principle of cultural relativism thus forced anthropologists to develop innovative methods and heuristic strategies.

===As a methodological tool===
Between World War I and II, &quot;cultural relativism&quot; was the central tool for American anthropologists in this rejection of Western claims to universality and salvage of non-Western cultures. It functioned to transform Boas&#x27; epistemology into methodological lessons.

This is most obvious in the case of language. Although language is commonly thought of as a means of communication, Boas called attention especially to the idea that it is also a means of categorizing experiences, hypothesizing that the existence of different languages suggests that people categorize, and thus experience, language differently (this view was more fully developed in the hypothesis of Linguistic relativity).

Thus, although all people perceive visible radiation the same way, in terms of a continuum of color, people who speak different languages slice up this continuum into discrete colors in different ways. Some languages have no word that corresponds to the English word &quot;green&quot;. When people who speak such languages are shown a green chip, some identify it using their word for &quot;blue&quot;, others identify it using their word for &quot;yellow&quot;. Thus, Boas&#x27;s student Melville Herskovits summed up the principle of cultural relativism thus: &quot;Judgements are based on experience, and experience is interpreted by each individual in terms of his own enculturation.&quot;

Boas pointed out that scientists grow up and work in a particular culture, and are thus necessarily ethnocentric. He provided an example of this in his 1889 article &quot;On Alternating Sounds&quot;. A number of linguists at Boas&#x27;s time had observed that speakers of some Native-American languages pronounced the same word with different sounds indiscriminately. They thought that this meant that the languages were unorganized and lacked strict rules for pronunciation, and they took it as evidence that the languages were more primitive than their own. Boas, however, noted that the variant pronunciations were not an effect of lack of organization of sound patterns, but an effect of the fact that these languages organized sounds differently from English. The languages grouped sounds that were considered distinct in English into a single sound, but also having contrasts that did not exist in English. He then argued the case that Native Americans had been pronouncing the word in question the same way, consistently, and the variation was only perceived by someone whose own language distinguishes those two sounds. Boas&#x27;s student, the linguist Edward Sapir, later noted also that English speakers pronounce sounds differently even when they think they are pronouncing the same sound. For example, few English speakers realize that the sounds written with the letter in the words &quot;tick&quot; and &quot;stick&quot; are phonetically different, the first being generally aspirated and the other unaspirated; a speaker of a language where this contrast is meaningful would instantly perceive them as different sounds and tend not to see them as different realizations of a single phoneme.

Boas&#x27;s students did not draw only on his engagement with German philosophy. They also engaged the work of contemporary philosophers and scientists, such as Karl Pearson, Ernst Mach, Henri Poincaré, William James, and John Dewey in an attempt to move, in the words of Boas&#x27;s student Robert Lowie, from &quot;a naively metaphysical to an epistemological stage&quot; as a basis for revising the methods and theories of anthropology.

Boas and his students realized that, if they were to conduct scientific research in other cultures, they would need to employ methods that would help them escape the limits of their own ethnocentrism. One such method is that of ethnography: basically, they advocated living with people of another culture for an extended period of time, so that they could learn the local language and be enculturated, at least partially, into that culture.

In this context, cultural relativism is an attitude that is of fundamental methodological importance, because it calls attention to the importance of the local context in understanding the meaning of particular human beliefs and activities. Thus, in 1948 Virginia Heyer wrote: &quot;Cultural relativity, to phrase it in starkest abstraction, states the relativity of the part to the whole. The part gains its cultural significance by its place in the whole, and cannot retain its integrity in a different situation.&quot;

===As a heuristic tool===
Another method was ethnology: to compare and contrast as wide a range of cultures as possible, in a systematic and even-handed manner. In the late nineteenth century, this study occurred primarily through the display of material artifacts in museums. Curators typically assumed that similar causes produce similar effects; therefore, in order to understand the causes of human action, they grouped similar artifacts together—regardless of provenance. Their aim was to classify artifacts, like biological organisms, according to families, genera, and species. Thus organized museum displays would illustrate the evolution of civilization from its crudest to its most refined forms.

In an article in the journal &quot;Science&quot;, Boas argued that this approach to cultural evolution ignored one of Charles Darwin&#x27;s main contributions to evolutionary theory:

Boas argued that although similar causes produce similar effects, different causes may also produce similar effects. Consequently, similar artifacts found in distinct and distant places may be the products of distinct causes. Against the popular method of drawing analogies in order to reach generalizations, Boas argued in favor of an inductive method. Based on his critique of contemporary museum displays, Boas concluded:

Boas&#x27;s student Alfred Kroeber described the rise of the relativist perspective thus:

This conception of culture, and principle of cultural relativism, were for Kroeber and his colleagues the fundamental contribution of anthropology, and what distinguished anthropology from similar disciplines such as sociology and psychology.

Ruth Benedict, another of Boas&#x27;s students, also argued that an appreciation of the importance of culture and the problem of ethnocentrism demands that the scientist adopt cultural relativism as a method. Her book, &quot;Patterns of Culture&quot;, did much to popularize the term in the United States. In it, she explained that:

Benedict was adamant that she was not romanticizing so-called primitive societies; she was emphasizing that any understanding of the totality of humanity must be based on as wide and varied a sample of individual cultures as possible. Moreover, it is only by appreciating a culture that is profoundly different from our own, that we can realize the extent to which our own beliefs and activities are culture-bound, rather than natural or universal. In this context, cultural relativism is a heuristic device of fundamental importance because it calls attention to the importance of variation in any sample that is used to derive generalizations about humanity.

==As a critical device==
Marcus and Fischer&#x27;s attention to anthropology&#x27;s refusal to accept Western culture&#x27;s claims to universality implies that cultural relativism is a tool not only in cultural understanding, but in cultural critique. This points to the second front on which they believe anthropology offers people enlightenment:

The critical function of cultural relativism is widely understood; philosopher John Cook observed that &quot;It is aimed at getting people to admit that although it may &quot;seem&quot; to them that their moral principles are self-evidently true, and hence &quot;seem&quot; to be grounds for passing judgement on other peoples, in fact, the self-evidence of these principles is a kind of illusion.&quot; Cook recognizes the middle ground in between moral relativism and moral absolutism that cultural relativism straddles, remarking that the ensuing battlegrounds that arise tend to be in the domain of claims of self-evidence made on behalf of a people.

The critical function was indeed one of the ends to which Benedict hoped her own work would meet. The most famous use of cultural relativism as a means of cultural critique is Margaret Mead&#x27;s research of adolescent female sexuality in Samoa. By contrasting the ease and freedom enjoyed by Samoan teenagers, Mead called into question claims that the stress and rebelliousness that characterize American adolescence is natural and inevitable.

As Marcus and Fischer point out, however, this use of relativism can be sustained only if there is ethnographic research in the United States comparable to the research conducted in Samoa. Although every decade has witnessed anthropologists conducting research in the United States, the very principles of relativism have led most anthropologists to conduct research in foreign countries.

==Comparison to moral relativism==
According to Marcus and Fischer, when the principle of cultural relativism was popularized after World War II, it came to be understood &quot;more as a doctrine, or position,
The principle of cultural relativity does not mean that because the members of some savage tribe are allowed to behave in a certain way that this fact gives intellectual warrant for such behavior in all groups. Cultural relativity means, on the contrary, that the appropriateness of any positive or negative custom must be evaluated with regard to how this habit fits with other group habits. While breeding a healthy scepticism as to the eternity of any value prized by a particular people, anthropology does not as a matter of theory deny the existence of moral absolutes. Rather, the use of the comparative method provides a scientific means of discovering such absolutes. If all surviving societies have found it necessary to impose some of the same restrictions upon the behavior of their members, this makes a strong argument that these aspects of the moral code are indispensable.

Although Kluckhohn was using language that was popular at the time (e.g. &quot;savage tribe&quot;) but which is now considered antiquated and coarse by most anthropologists, his point was that although moral standards are rooted in one&#x27;s culture, anthropological research reveals that the fact that people have moral standards is a universal. He was especially interested in deriving specific moral standards that are universal, although few if any anthropologists think that he was successful.

There is an ambiguity in Kluckhohn&#x27;s formulation that would haunt anthropologists in the years to come. It makes it clear that one&#x27;s moral standards make sense in terms of one&#x27;s culture. He waffles, however, on whether the moral standards of one society could be applied to another. Four years later American anthropologists had to confront this issue head-on.

=== Vertical and horizontal relativism ===
It was James Lawrence Wray-Miller who provided an additional clarification tool, or caveat, of the theoretical underpinnings of cultural relativism by dividing it into two binary, analytical continuums: vertical and horizontal cultural relativism. Ultimately, these two analytical continuums share the same basic conclusion: that human morality and ethics are not static but fluid and vary across cultures depending on the time period and current condition of any particular culture.

Vertical relativism describes that cultures, throughout history (&quot;vertical&quot;—i.e., passage through past and future), are products of the prevailing societal norms and conditions of their respective historical periods. Therefore, any moral or ethical judgments, made during the present, regarding past cultures&#x27; belief systems or societal practices must be firmly
grounded and informed by these norms and conditions to be intellectually useful. Vertical relativism also accounts for the possibility that cultural values and norms will necessarily change as influencing norms and conditions change in the future.

Horizontal relativism describes that cultures in the present (&quot;horizontal&quot; in time—i.e., the present period of the culture) are products of the prevailing norms and conditions developed as a result of their unique geographies, histories, and environmental influences. Therefore, moral or ethical judgments, made during the present, regarding a current culture&#x27;s belief system or societal practices must account for these unique differences to be intellectually useful.

===Statement on human rights===
The transformation of cultural relativism as a heuristic tool into the doctrine of moral relativism occurred in the context of the work of the Commission of Human Rights of the United Nations in preparing the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948).

Melville J. Herskovits prepared a draft &quot;Statement on Human Rights&quot; which Executive Board of the American Anthropological Association revised, submitted to the Commission on Human Rights, and then published. The statement begins with a fairly straightforward explanation of the relevance of cultural relativism:
 
Although this statement could be read as making a procedural point (that the Commission must involve people of diverse cultures, especially cultures that had been or are still under European colonial or imperial domination), the document ended by making two substantive claims:
# Even where political systems exist that deny citizens the right of participation in their government, or seek to conquer weaker peoples, underlying cultural values may be called on to bring the peoples of such states to a realization of the consequences of the acts of their governments, and thus enforce a brake upon discrimination and conquest.
# Worldwide standards of freedom and justice, based on the principle that man is free only when he lives as his society defines freedom, that his rights are those he recognizes as a member of his society, must be basic.

These claims provoked an immediate response by a number of anthropologists. Julian Steward (who, as a student of Alfred Kroeber and Robert Lowie, and as a professor at Columbia University, was situated firmly in the Boasian lineage) suggested that the first claim &quot;may have been a loophole to exclude Germany from the advocated tolerance&quot;, but that it revealed the fundamental flaw in moral relativism:&quot;Either we tolerate everything, and keep hands off, or we fight intolerance and conquest—political and economic as well as military—in all their forms.&quot; Similarly, he questioned whether the second principle means that anthropologists &quot;approve the social caste system of India, the racial caste system of the United States, or many other varieties of social discrimination in the world.&quot; Steward and others argued that any attempt to apply the principle of cultural relativism to moral problems would only end in contradiction: either a principle that seems to stand for tolerance ends up being used to excuse intolerance, or the principle of tolerance is revealed to be utterly intolerant of any society that seems to lack the (arguably, Western) value of tolerance. They concluded that anthropologists must stick to science, and engage in debates over values only as individuals.

== Governmental usage ==
Several countries have used cultural relativism as a justification for limiting the rights in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, despite the World Conference on Human Rights rejecting it as a refutation of human rights violations.

A 2011 study by international legal expert Roger Lloret Blackburn, examining the Universal Periodic Reviews, distinguishes several different groups of nations:

* One group consists of nations where the current regime has been installed by revolution, and that deny the need for political plurality: China, Vietnam, Myanmar, Cuba, and Iran. 
* Another group are certain Islamic nations that adhere to &quot;sharia&quot; and certain traditional practices: Yemen, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan.
* A third possible group is nations that give special rights to specific groups: Malaysia, Mexico, Indonesia, and Colombia.

==Criticism==
The debate over the &quot;Statement on Human Rights&quot;, then, was not merely over the validity of cultural relativism, or the question of what makes a right universal. It forced anthropologists to confront the question of whether anthropological research is relevant to non-anthropologists. Although Steward and Barnett seemed to be suggesting that anthropology as such should restrict itself to purely academic affairs, people within and without the academy have continued to debate the ways non-anthropologists have used this principle in public policy concerning ethnic minorities or in international relations.

Political scientist Alison Dundes Renteln has argued that most debates over moral relativism misunderstand the importance of cultural relativism. Most philosophers understand the Benedictine–Herskovitz formulation of cultural relativism to mean:

Although this formulation clearly echoes the kinds of example anthropologists used in elaborating cultural relativism, Renteln believes that it misses the spirit of the principle. Accordingly, she supports a different formulation: &quot;there are or can be no value judgements that are true, that is, objectively justifiable, independent of specific cultures.&quot;

Renteln faults philosophers for disregarding the heuristic and critical functions of cultural relativism. Her main argument is that in order to understand the principle of cultural relativism, one must recognize the extent to which it is based on enculturation: &quot;the idea that people unconsciously acquire the categories and standards of their culture.&quot; This observation, which echoes the arguments about culture that originally led Boas to develop the principle, suggests that the use of cultural relativism in debates of rights and morals is not substantive but procedural. That is, it does not require a relativist to sacrifice his or her values. But it does require anyone engaged in a consideration of rights and morals to reflect on how their own enculturation has shaped their views:

Renteln thus bridges the gap between the anthropologist as scientist (whom Steward and Barnett felt had nothing to offer debates on rights and morality) and as private individual (who has every right to make value judgements). The individual keeps this right, but the scientist requires that the individual acknowledge that these judgements are neither self-evident universals, nor entirely personal (and idiosyncratic), but rather took form in relation to the individual&#x27;s own culture.

===Post-colonial politics===
Boas and his students understood anthropology to be a historical, or human science, in that it involves subjects (anthropologists) studying other subjects (humans and their activities), rather than subjects studying objects (such as rocks or stars). Under such conditions, it is fairly obvious that scientific research may have political consequences, and the Boasians saw no conflict between their scientific attempts to understand other cultures, and the political implications of critiquing their own culture. For anthropologists working in this tradition, the doctrine of cultural relativism as a basis for moral relativism was anathema. For politicians, moralists, and many social scientists (but few anthropologists) who saw science and human interests as necessarily independent or even opposed, however, the earlier Boasian principle of cultural relativism was anathema. Thus, cultural relativism came under attack, but from opposing sides and for opposing reasons.

===Political critique===
On the one hand, many anthropologists began to criticize the way moral relativism, in the guise of cultural relativism, is used to mask the effects of Western colonialism and imperialism. Thus, Stanley Diamond argued that when the term &quot;cultural relativism&quot; entered popular culture, popular culture co-opted anthropology in a way that voided the principle of any critical function:

George Stocking summarized this view with the observation that &quot;Cultural relativism, which had buttressed the attack against racialism, [can] be perceived as a sort of neo-racialism justifying the backward techno-economic status of once colonized peoples.&quot;

===Defence by Clifford Geertz===
By the 1980s many anthropologists had absorbed the Boasian critique of moral relativism, and were ready to reevaluate the origins and uses of cultural relativism. In a distinguished lecture before the American Anthropological Association in 1984, Clifford Geertz claimed that the critics of cultural relativism did not really understand, and were not really responding to, the ideas of Benedict, Herskovits, Kroeber and Kluckhohn. Consequently, the various critics and proponents of cultural relativism were talking past one another. What these different positions have in common, Geertz argued, is that they are all responding to the same thing: knowledge about other ways of life.

Geertz concludes this discussion by commenting, &quot;As I have already suggested, I myself find provincialism altogether the more real concern so far as what actually goes on in the world.&quot; Geertz&#x27; defense of cultural relativism as a concern which should motivate various inquiries, rather than as an explanation or solution, echoed a comment Alfred Kroeber made in reply to earlier critics of cultural relativism, in 1949:

<doc id="54944" wikidata="Q13408093" url="?curid=54944" title="Religious intolerance">
<text>Religious intolerance or religious bigotry is intolerance of another&#x27;s religious beliefs, practices, faith or lack thereof. 

Statements which are contrary to one&#x27;s religious beliefs do not constitute intolerance. Religious intolerance, rather, occurs when a person or group (e.g., a society, a religious group, a non-religious group) specifically refuses to tolerate the religious convictions and practices of a religious group or individual.

==Historical perspectives==
The intolerance, and even the active persecution of religious minorities (sometimes religious majorities as in modern Bahrain or the Pre-Dutch Indonesian kingdoms), has a long history. Almost all religions have historically faced and perpetrated persecution of other viewpoints.

The modern concept of religious tolerance developed out of the European wars of religion, more specifically out of the Peace of Westphalia which ended the 30 Years&#x27; War (1618–1648), during the Protestant Reformation and the ensuing conflicts between Protestants and Catholics in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. The doctrine of &#x27;religious toleration&#x27; was established as a result of the 30 Years&#x27; War between the Catholic Hapsburgs and newly Protestant nations like Sweden under Gustavus Adolphus. At this time, rulers sought to eradicate religious sentiments and dogmas from their political demesnes. The 1648 Treaty gave nations the right of sovereignty and it also allowed minority Christian denominations to exist within the Holy Roman Empire.

==Contemporary attitude and practice==
The constitutions of some countries contain provisions which expressly forbid the state from engaging in certain acts of religious intolerance and these same provisions also forbid the state from showing a preference for a particular religion within its own borders, examples of such provisions include the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, the Article 4 of the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany, Article 44.2.1 of the Constitution of Ireland, Article 40 of the Estonian Constitution, Article 24 of the Constitution of Turkey, Article 36 of the Constitution of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, and Article 3 Section 5 of the Constitution of the Philippines.

Other states, whilst not containing constitutional provisions which are directly related to religion, nonetheless contain provisions which forbid discrimination on religious grounds (see, for example, Article 1 of the Constitution of France, article 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and article 40 of the Constitution of Egypt). These constitutional provisions do not necessarily guarantee that all elements of the state remain free from religious intolerance at all times, and practice can vary widely from country to country.

Other countries, meanwhile, may allow for religious preference, for instance through the establishment of one or more state religions, but not for religious intolerance. Finland, for example, has the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland and Finnish Orthodox Church as its official state religions, yet upholds the right of free expression of religion in article 11 of its constitution.

In Nazi Germany, smaller religious minorities such as the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses and the Baháʼí Faith were banned in Germany, while the eradication of Judaism was attempted along with the genocide of its adherents.

Hundreds of religious riots have been recorded, in every decade of independent India. In these riots, the victims have included many Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Christians and Buddhists. The US Commission on International Religious Freedom classified India as Tier-2 in persecuting religious minorities, the same as that of Iraq and Egypt. In a 2018 report, USCIRF charged Hindu nationalist groups for their campaign to &quot;Saffronize&quot; India through violence, intimidation, and harassment against non-Hindus. Approximately one-third of state governments enforced anti-conversion and/or anti-cow slaughter laws against non-Hindus, and mobs engaged in violence against Muslims whose families have been engaged in the dairy, leather, or beef trades for generations, and against Christians for proselytizing. &quot;Cow protection&quot; lynch mobs killed at least 10 victims in 2017.

Some countries retain laws which forbid the defamation of religious beliefs. Some constitutions retain laws which forbid all forms of blasphemy (e.g., Germany where, in 2006, Manfred van H. was convicted of blasphemy against Islam). The connection between intolerance and blasphemy laws is closest when the laws apply to only one religion. In Pakistan blasphemy directed against either the tenets of the Qur&#x27;an or the Prophet Mohammed is punishable by either life imprisonment or death. Apostasy, the rejection of one&#x27;s old religion, is also criminalized in a number of countries, notably Afghanistan with Abdul Rahman being the first to face the death penalty for converting to Christianity. Though, he was later released.
The United Nations upholds the right to freely express one&#x27;s religious beliefs, as listed in the UN&#x27;s charter, and additionally in articles 2 and 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Article 2 forbids discrimination based on religious grounds. Article 18 protects the freedom to change one&#x27;s religion. 
As a treaty, not a , is legally binding, the signing of the human rights declaration is a public pledge of commitment. Out of a desire to avoid subservience to an international court, the United States chose in 1998 to pass the International Religious Freedom Act, creating the Commission on International Religious Freedom, and mandating that the United States government take action against any country found to violate the religious freedoms outlined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Human Rights Council in 2011 adopted Resolution 16/18 on &quot;Combating intolerance, negative stereotyping and stigmatization of, and discrimination, incitement to violence and violence against, persons based on religion or belief&quot; which was hailed by stakeholders from all regions and faiths as a turning point in international efforts to confront religious intolerance. The European Convention on Human Rights, which is legally binding on all European Union states (following the passage of the Human Rights Act 1998 in the United Kingdom), makes restricting the rights of an individual to practice or change their religion illegal in article 9, and discrimination on the basis of religion illegal in article 14.

In North Korea, The regime reportedly continues to repress the religious activities of unauthorized religious groups. North Korea is considered an atheist state, where refugees, defectors and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) continued to allege that they witnessed the arrests and execution of members of underground Christian churches by the regime in prior years. Due to the country&#x27;s inaccessibility and the inability to gain timely information, this activity remains difficult to verify.

In its 2000 annual report on international religious freedom, the U.S. State Department cited China, Myanmar, Iran, Iraq and Sudan for persecuting people for their religious faith and practices. The report, which covers July 1999 through June 2000, details U.S. policy toward countries where religious freedom is violated in the view of the State Department.

The advocacy group Freedom House produced a report entitled &quot;Religious Freedom in the World&quot; in 2000 which ranked countries according to their religious freedom. The countries receiving a score of 7, indicating those where religious freedom was least respected, were Turkmenistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Myanmar and North Korea. China was given a score of 6 overall, however Tibet was listed separately in the 7 category. Those countries receiving a score of 1, indicating the highest level of religious freedom, were Estonia, Finland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway and the United States.

Within those countries that openly advocate religious tolerance there remain debates as to the limits of tolerance. Some individuals and religious groups, for example, retain beliefs or practices which involve acts contrary to established law, such as the use of cannabis by members of the Rastafari movement, the religious use of eagle feathers by non-Native Americans (contrary to the eagle feather law, 50 CFR 22), or the practice of polygamy amongst the LDS Church in the 19th century.

== In Australia ==
Religious freedom has developed partly due to the agreeable relationship between religious groups in its society. Several non-governmental organizations promoted tolerance and better understanding among religions in the country, both indigenous and non-indigenous. These groups included the Columbian Centre for Christian-Muslim Relations, the National Council of Churches in Australia and its affiliated Aboriginal and Islander Commission, and the Australian Council of Christians and Jews. In Victoria, Australia the Racial and Religious Tolerance Act 2001 makes illegal &quot;conduct that incites hatred against, serious contempt for, or revulsion or severe ridicule of, that other person or class of persons&quot; on the grounds of religious belief.

In 2003, in response to an increase in anti-Islamic sentiment, the HREOC undertook a project involving national consultations on eliminating prejudice against Arab and Muslim citizens. As part of the consultations, the commission considered whether Muslim citizens shared an ethnic origin or race, as well as a religion, which would entitle them to comprehensive protection under the Federal Race Discrimination Act. The commission&#x27;s report, made public in June 2004, contained no findings on the racial status of Arab and Muslim citizens. In January 2005 the leader of the neo-Nazi Australian Nationalist Movement was connected to incidents in 2004 in which several Asian-owned businesses and a synagogue in Perth were firebombed or sprayed with racist graffiti. On December 11, 2005, there was a riot in the Sydney suburb of Cronulla, that erupted because a group of Lebanese-Australian youths had assaulted two lifeguards. Demonstrators against the assault displayed anti-Arab and anti-Muslim slogans. When the gathering turned violent, bystanders perceived to be of Middle Eastern origin or Muslim were attacked. The following day, retaliatory vandalism and other assaults were reported around Sydney.

<text>Ebenales is an order of flowering plants. This order was recognized in several systems, for example the Bentham &amp; Hooker system and the Engler system, although the Wettstein system preferred the name Diospyrales&#x27;. In the 1981 version of the Cronquist system it was an order placed in subclass Dilleniidae with the following :

*order Ebenales
*: family Ebenaceae
*: family Sapotaceae
*: family Styracaceae
*: family Symplocaceae

In the APG II system all the plants involved are assigned to the hugely expanded order &quot;Ericales&quot;.

<text>, also known by its abbreviation , is a genre of fictional media originating in Japan that depicts homoerotic relationships between male characters. It is typically created by women for a female audience, distinguishing it from the equivalent genre of homoerotic media created by and for gay men, though BL does also attract a male audience and can be produced by male creators. BL spans a wide range of media, including manga, anime, drama CDs, novels, video games, television series, films, and fan works. 

Though depictions of homosexuality in Japanese media have a history dating to ancient times, contemporary BL traces its origins to male-male romance manga that emerged in the 1970s, and which formed a new subgenre of &quot;shōjo&quot; manga (comics for girls). Several terms were used for this genre, including , , and . The term ( ; ) emerged as a name for the genre in the late 1970s and early 1980s in the context of (self-published works) culture as a portmanteau of &quot;yama nashi, ochi nashi, imi nashi&quot; (&quot;no climax, no point, no meaning&quot;), where it was used in a self-deprecating manner to refer to amateur fan works that focused on sex to the exclusion of plot and character development, and that often parodied mainstream manga and anime by depicting male characters from popular series in sexual scenarios. &quot;Boys&#x27; love&quot; was later adopted by Japanese publications in the 1990s as an umbrella term for male-male romance media marketed to women.

Concepts and themes associated with BL include androgynous men known as &quot;bishōnen&quot;; diminished female characters; narratives that emphasize homosociality and de-emphasize socio-cultural homophobia; and depictions of rape. A defining characteristic of BL is the practice of pairing characters in relationships according to the roles of &quot;seme&quot;, the sexual top or active pursuer, and &quot;uke&quot;, the sexual bottom or passive pursued. BL has a robust global presence, having spread since the 1990s through international licensing and distribution, as well as through unlicensed circulation of works by BL fans online. BL works, culture, and fandom have been studied and discussed by scholars and journalists worldwide.

==Etymology and terminology==

Multiple terms exist to describe Japanese and Japanese-influenced male-male romance fiction as a genre. In a 2015 survey of professional Japanese male-male romance fiction writers by Kazuko Suzuki, five primary subgenres were identified:
:While the term &quot;shōnen-ai&quot; historically connoted ephebophilia or pederasty, beginning in the 1970s it was used to describe a new genre of &quot;shōjo&quot; manga (girls&#x27; manga) featuring romance between &quot;bishōnen&quot; ( &quot;beautiful boys&quot;), a term for androgynous or effeminate male characters. Early &quot;shōnen-ai&quot; works were inspired by European literature, the writings of Taruho Inagaki, and the &quot;Bildungsroman&quot; genre. &quot;Shōnen-ai&quot; often features references to literature, history, science, and philosophy; Suzuki describes the genre as being &quot;pedantic&quot; and &quot;difficult to understand&quot;, with &quot;philosophical and abstract musings&quot; that challenged young readers who were often only able to understand the references and deeper themes as they grew older.
: as a term and concept predates male-male romance manga that emerged in the 1970s, having originated to describe erotic highbrow literary fiction by authors such as Yukio Mishima, Jun&#x27;ichirō Tanizaki, and Yasunari Kawabata. By the 1980s, magazines aimed at fans were using the term to describe fiction by both amateur and professional writers published in those magazines, as well as to designate literature with themes of homoeroticism and implied homosexuality by authors such as Oscar Wilde, Jean Cocteau, Tatsuhiko Shibusawa, and Mishima. in this context is primarily used to describe prose fiction, but has also been used for manga and visual art.
:Derived from the eponymous male-male romance manga magazine first published in 1978, the term was originally used to describe works that resembled the art style of manga published in that magazine. It has also been used to describe amateur works depicting male homosexuality that are original creations and not derivative works. By the 1990s, the term had largely fallen out of use in favor of &quot;boys&#x27; love&quot;; it has been suggested that publishers wishing to get a foothold in the &quot;June&quot; market coined &quot;boys&#x27; love&quot; to disassociate the genre from the publisher of &quot;June&quot;.
:Coined in the late 1970s by manga artists Yasuko Sakata and Akiko Hatsu, &quot;yaoi&quot; is a portmanteau of , which translates to &quot;no climax, no point, no meaning&quot;. Initially used by artists as a self-deprecating and ironic euphemism, the portmanteau refers to how early &quot;yaoi&quot; works typically focused on sex to the exclusion of plot and character development; it is also a subversive reference to the classical Japanese narrative structure of introduction, development, twist, and conclusion.
:Typically written as the acronym , or alternately as &quot;boy&#x27;s love&quot; or &quot;boys love&quot;, the term is a &quot;wasei-eigo&quot; construction derived from the literal English translation of &quot;shōnen-ai&quot;. First used in 1991 by the magazine &quot;Image&quot; in an effort to collect these disparate genres under a single term, the term became widely popularized in 1994 after being used by the magazine &quot;&quot;. &quot;BL&quot; is the common term used to describe male-male romance media marketed to women in Japan and much of Asia, though its usage in the West is inconsistent.

Despite attempts by researchers to codify differences between these subgenres, in practice these terms are used interchangeably. Kazumi Nagaike and Tomoko Aoyama note that while BL and are the most common generic terms for this kind of media, they specifically avoid attempts at defining subgenres, noting that the differences between them are ill-defined and that even when differentiated, the subgenres &quot;remain thematically intertwined.&quot;

In Suzuki&#x27;s investigation of these subgenres, she notes that &quot;there is no appropriate and convenient Japanese shorthand term to embrace all subgenres of male-male love fiction by and for women.&quot; has been used as an umbrella term in the West for Japanese-influenced comics with male-male relationships, and was preferentially used by American manga publishers for works of this kind due to the belief that the term &quot;boys&#x27; love&quot; carries the implication of pedophilia. In Japan, is used to denote &quot;dōjinshi&quot; and works that focus on sex scenes. In all usages, and boys&#x27; love excludes gay manga (&quot;bara&quot;), a genre which also depicts gay male sexual relationships, but is written for and mostly by gay men. 

In the West, the term &quot;shōnen-ai&quot; is sometimes used to describe titles that focus on romance over explicit sexual content, while &quot;yaoi&quot; is used to describe titles that primarily feature sexually explicit themes and subject material. &quot;Yaoi&quot; can also be used by Western fans as a label for anime or manga-based slash fiction. The Japanese use of &quot;yaoi&quot; to denote only works with explicit scenes sometimes clashes with the Western use of the word to describe the genre as a whole, creating confusion between Japanese and Western audiences.

==History==
===Before 1970: The origins of &quot;shōnen-ai&quot;===

Homosexuality and androgyny have a history in Japan dating to ancient times, as seen in practices such as and . The country shifted away from a tolerance of homosexuality amid Westernization during the Meiji Era (1868–1912), and moved towards hostile social attitudes towards homosexuality and the implementation of anti-sodomy laws.

In the face of this legal and cultural shift, artists who depicted male homosexuality in their work typically did so through subtext. Illustrations by in the &quot;shōnen&quot; manga (boys&#x27; comics) magazine &quot;Nihon Shōnen&quot; formed the foundation of what would become the aesthetic of &quot;bishōnen&quot;: boys and young men, often in homosocial or homoerotic contexts, who are defined by their &quot;ambivalent passivity, fragility, ephemerality, and softness.&quot; The 1961 novel &quot;A Lovers&#x27; Forest&quot; by &quot;tanbi&quot; writer Mari Mori, which follows the relationship between a professor and his younger male lover, is regarded as an influential precursor to the &quot;shōnen-ai&quot; genre. Mori&#x27;s works were influenced by European literature, particularly Gothic literature, and laid the foundation for many of the common tropes of &quot;shōnen-ai&quot;, , and BL: western exoticism, educated and wealthy characters, significant age differences among couples, and fanciful or even surreal settings.

In manga, the concept of emerged in the late 1950s, which sought to use manga to tell serious and grounded stories aimed at adult audiences. &quot;Gekiga&quot; inspired the creation of manga that depicted realistic human relationships, and opened the way for manga that explored human sexuality in a non-pornographic context. Hideko Mizuno&#x27;s 1969 &quot;shōjo&quot; manga (girls&#x27; comics) series &quot;Fire!&quot; (1969–1971), which eroticized its male protagonists and depicted male homosexuality in American rock and roll culture, is noted as an influential work in this regard.

===1970s and 1980s: From &quot;shōnen-ai&quot; to &quot;yaoi&quot;===

Contemporary Japanese homoerotic romance manga originated in the 1970s as a subgenre of &quot;shōjo&quot; manga. The decade saw the arrival of a new generation of &quot;shōjo&quot; manga artists, most notable among them the Year 24 Group. The Year 24 Group contributed significantly to the development of the &quot;shōjo&quot; manga, introducing a greater diversity of themes and subject material to the genre that drew inspiration from by Japanese and European literature, cinema, and history. Members of the group, including Keiko Takemiya and Moto Hagio, created works that depicted male homosexuality: &quot;In The Sunroom&quot; (1970) by Takemiya is considered the first work of the genre that would become known as &quot;shōnen-ai&quot;, followed by Hagio&#x27;s &quot;The November Gymnasium&quot; (1971).

Takemiya, Hagio, Toshie Kihara, Ryoko Yamagishi, and Kaoru Kurimoto were among the most significant &quot;shōnen-ai&quot; artists of this era; notable works include &quot;The Heart of Thomas&quot; (1974–1975) by Hagio and &quot;Kaze to Ki no Uta&quot; (1976-1984) by Takemiya. Works by these artists typically featured tragic romances between androgynous &quot;bishōnen&quot; in historic European settings. Though these works were nominally aimed at an audience of adolescent girls and young women, they also attracted adult gay and lesbian readers. During this same period, the first gay manga magazines were published: &quot;Barazoku&quot;, the first commercially circulated gay men&#x27;s magazine in Japan, was published in 1971, and served as a major influence on Takemiya and the development of &quot;shōnen-ai&quot;.

The (self-published works) subculture emerged contemporaneously in the 1970s (see Media below), and in 1975, the first Comiket was held as a gathering of amateur artists who produce . The term &quot;yaoi&quot;, initially used by some creators of male-male romance to describe their creations ironically, emerged to describe amateur works that were influenced by and gay manga. Early &quot;yaoi&quot; produced for Comiket were typically derivative works, with glam rock artists such as David Bowie and Queen as popular subjects as a result of the influence of &quot;Fire!&quot;; &quot;yaoi&quot; were also more sexually explicit than &quot;shōnen-ai&quot;.

In reaction to the success of &quot;shōnen-ai&quot; and early &quot;yaoi&quot;, publishers sought to exploit the market by creating magazines devoted to the genre. Young female illustrators cemented themselves in the manga industry by publishing &quot;yaoi&quot; works, with this genre later becoming &quot;a transnational subculture.&quot; Publishing house , which published the gay manga magazine , launched the magazine &quot;June&quot; in 1978, while launched &quot;Allan&quot; in 1980. Both magazines initially specialized in &quot;shōnen-ai&quot;, which Magazine Magazine described as &quot;halfway between &quot;tanbi&quot; literature and pornography,&quot; and also published articles on homosexuality, literary fiction, illustrations, and amateur &quot;yaoi&quot; works. The success of &quot;June&quot; was such that the term &quot;June-mono&quot; or more simply &quot;June&quot; began to compete with the term &quot;shōnen-ai&quot; to describe works depicting male homosexuality.

By the late 1980s, the popularity of professionally published &quot;shōnen-ai&quot; was declining, and &quot;yaoi&quot; published as &quot;dōjinshi&quot; was becoming more popular. Mainstream &quot;shōnen&quot; manga with Japanese settings such as &quot;Captain Tsubasa&quot; became popular source material for derivative works by &quot;yaoi&quot; creators, and the genre increasingly depicted Japanese settings over western settings. Works influenced by &quot;shōnen-ai&quot; in the 1980s began to depict older protagonists and adopted a realist style in both plot and artwork, as typified by manga such as &quot;Banana Fish&quot; (1985–1994) by Akimi Yoshida and &quot;Tomoi&quot; (1986) by . The 1980s also saw the proliferation of &quot;yaoi&quot; into anime, drama CDs, and light novels; the 1982 anime adaptation of &quot;Patalliro!&quot; was the first television anime to depict &quot;shōnen-ai&quot; themes, while &quot;Kaze to Ki no Uta&quot; and &quot;Earthian&quot; were adapted into anime in the original video animation (home video) format in 1987 and 1989, respectively.

===1990s: Mainstream popularity and &quot;yaoi ronsō&quot;===

The growing popularity of &quot;yaoi&quot; attracted the attention of manga magazine editors, many of whom recruited &quot;yaoi&quot; authors to their publications; &quot;Zetsuai 1989&quot; (1989–1991) by Minami Ozaki, a &quot;yaoi&quot; series published in the &quot;shōjo&quot; magazine &quot;Margaret&quot;, was originally a &quot;Captain Tsubasa&quot; created by Ozaki that she adapted into an original work. By 1990, seven Japanese publishers included &quot;yaoi&quot; content in their offerings, which kickstarted the commercial publishing market of the genre. Between 1990 and 1995, thirty magazines devoted to &quot;yaoi&quot; were established: &quot;Magazine Be × Boy&quot;, founded in 1993, became one of the most influential &quot;yaoi&quot; manga magazines of this era. The manga in these magazines were influenced by realist stories like &quot;Banana Fish&quot;, and moved away from the &quot;shōnen-ai&quot; standards of the 1970s and 1980s. &quot;Shōnen-ai&quot; works that were published during this period were typically comedies rather than melodramas, such as &quot;Gravitation&quot; (1996–2002) by Maki Murakami. Consequently, &quot;yaoi&quot; and &quot;boys&#x27; love&quot; (BL) came to be the most popular terms to describe works depicting male-male romance, eclipsing &quot;shōnen-ai&quot; and &quot;June&quot;.

An increasing proportion of &quot;shōjo&quot; manga in the 1990s began to integrate &quot;yaoi&quot; elements into their plots. The manga artist group Clamp, which itself began as a group creating &quot;yaoi&quot; , published multiple works containing &quot;yaoi&quot; elements during this period, such as &quot;RG Veda&quot; (1990–1995), &quot;Tokyo Babylon&quot; (1991–1994), and &quot;Cardcaptor Sakura&quot; (1996–2000). When these works were released in North America, they were among the first &quot;yaoi&quot;-influenced media to be encountered by Western audiences. BL gained popularity in mainland China in the late 1990s; the country subsequently outlawed the publishing and distribution of BL works.

The mid-1990s saw the so-called &quot;&quot;yaoi&quot; debate&quot; or &quot;yaoi ronsō&quot; (や お い 論争), a debate held primarily in a series of essays published in the feminist magazine &quot;Choisir&quot; from 1992 to 1997. In an open letter, Japanese gay writer Masaki Satō criticized the genre as homophobic for not depicting gay men accurately, and called fans of &quot;yaoi&quot; &quot;disgusting women&quot; who &quot;have a perverse interest in sexual intercourse between men.&quot; A years-long debate ensued, with &quot;yaoi&quot; fans and artists contending that &quot;yaoi&quot; is entertainment for women that does not seek to be a realistic depiction of homosexuality, and instead serves as a refuge from the misogyny of Japanese society. The scholarly debate that the &quot;yaoi ronsō&quot; engendered led to the formation of the field of &quot;BL studies&quot;, which focus on the study of BL and the relationship between women and BL. It additionally impacted creators of &quot;yaoi&quot;: author Chiyo Kurihara abandoned &quot;yaoi&quot; to focus on heterosexual pornography as a result of the &quot;yaoi ronsō&quot;, while Hisako Takamatsu took into account the arguments of the genre&#x27;s critics to create works more accommodating of a gay audience.

===2000s–present: Globalization of &quot;yaoi&quot; and BL===

The economic crisis caused by the Lost Decade came to affect the manga industry in the late 1990s and early 2000s, but did not particularly impact the &quot;yaoi&quot; market; on the contrary, &quot;yaoi&quot; magazines continued to proliferate during this period, and sales of &quot;yaoi&quot; media increased. In 2004, Otome Road in Ikebukuro emerged as a major cultural destination for &quot;yaoi&quot; fandom, with multiple stores dedicated to &quot;shōjo&quot; and &quot;yaoi&quot; goods. The 2000s also saw an increase in male readers of &quot;yaoi&quot;, with a 2008 bookstore survey finding that between 25 and 30 percent of &quot;yaoi&quot; readers were male.

The 2000s saw significant growth of &quot;yaoi&quot; in international markets, beginning with the founding of the American anime convention Yaoi-Con in 2001. The first officially-licensed English-language translations of &quot;yaoi&quot; manga were published in the North American market in 2003 (see Media below); the market expanded rapidly before contracting in 2008 as a result of the global financial crisis of 2007–2008, but continued to grow slowly in the following years. South Korea saw the development of BL in the form of &quot;manhwa&quot;, notably &quot;Martin and John&quot; (2006) by Park Hee-jung and &quot;Crush on You&quot; (2006) by Lee Kyung-ha.

The 2010s and 2020s saw an increase in the popularity of &quot;yaoi&quot; and BL media in China and Thailand in the form of web novels, live-action films, and live-action television dramas (see Media below). Though &quot;boys&#x27; love&quot; and &quot;BL&quot; have become the generic terms for this material across Asia, in Thailand, BL dramas are sometimes referred to as &quot;Y&quot; or &quot;Y series&quot; as a shorthand for &quot;yaoi&quot;. Thai Series Y explicitly adapts the content of Japanese BL to the Thai local context and in recent years has become increasingly popular with fans around the world who often view Thai BL as separate to its Japanese antecedents. Thai BL also deliberately borrows from K-pop celebrity culture in the development of its own style of idols known as &quot;khu jin&quot; (imaginary couples) who are designed to be paired together by Thai BL&#x27;s predominantly female fans. For cultural anthropologist Thomas Baudinette, BL series produced in Thailand represent the next stage in the historic development of BL, which is increasingly becoming &quot;dislocated&quot; from Japan among international fans&#x27; understanding of the genre.

While BL fandom in China traces back to the late 1990s as &quot;danmei&quot; (the Mandarin reading of the Japanese term &quot;tanbi&quot;), state regulations in China made it difficult for &quot;danmei&quot; writers to publish their works online, with a 2009 ordinance by the National Publishing Administration of China banning most &quot;danmei&quot; online fiction. In 2015, laws prohibiting depictions of same-sex relationships in television and film were implemented in China. The growth in streaming service providers in the 2010s is regarded as a driving force behind the production of BL dramas across Asia, as online distribution provides a platform for media containing non-heterosexual material, which is frequently not permitted on broadcast television.

==Concepts and themes==
===&quot;Bishōnen&quot;===


The protagonists of BL are often , &quot;highly idealised&quot; boys and young men who blend both masculine and feminine qualities. &quot;Bishōnen&quot; as a concept can be found disparately throughout East Asia, but its specific aesthetic manifestation in 1970s &quot;shōjo&quot; manga (and subsequently in manga) drew influence from popular culture of the era, including glam rock artists such as David Bowie, actor Björn Andrésen&#x27;s portrayal of Tadzio in the 1971 film adaptation of &quot;Death in Venice&quot;, and kabuki &quot;onnagata&quot; Bandō Tamasaburō. Though &quot;bishōnen&quot; are not exclusive to BL, the androgyny of &quot;bishōnen&quot; is often exploited to explore notions of sexuality and gender in BL works.

The late 2010s saw the increasing popularity of masculine men in BL that are reminiscent of the body types typical in gay manga, with growing emphasis on stories featuring muscular bodies and older characters. A 2017 survey by BL publisher Juné Manga found that while over 80% of their readership previously preferred &quot;bishōnen&quot; body types exclusively, 65% now enjoy both &quot;bishōnen&quot; and muscular body types. Critics and commentators have noted that this shift in preferences among BL readers, and subsequent creation of works that feature characteristics of both BL and gay manga, represents a blurring of the distinctions between the genres; anthropologist Thomas Baudinette notes in his fieldwork that gay men in Japan &quot;saw no need to sharply disassociate BL from [gay manga] when discussing their consumption of &#x27;gay media&#x27;.&quot;

===&quot;Seme&quot; and &quot;uke&quot;===

The two participants in a BL relationship (and to a lesser extent in &quot;yuri&quot;) are often referred to as and . These terms originated in martial arts, and were later appropriated as Japanese LGBT slang to refer to the insertive and receptive partners in anal sex. Aleardo Zanghellini suggests that the martial arts terms have special significance to a Japanese audience, as an archetype of the gay male relationship in Japan includes same-sex love between samurai and their companions. He suggests that the samurai archetype is responsible for age differences and hierarchical variations in power of some relationships portrayed in BL.

The &quot;seme&quot; is often depicted as restrained, physically powerful, and protective; he is generally older and taller, with a stronger chin, shorter hair, smaller eyes, and a more stereotypically masculine and &quot;macho&quot; demeanour than the &quot;uke&quot;. The &quot;seme&quot; usually pursues the &quot;uke&quot;, who often has softer, androgynous, feminine features with bigger eyes and a smaller build, and is often physically weaker than the &quot;seme&quot;. The roles of &quot;seme&quot; and &quot;uke&quot; can alternatively be established by who is dominant in the relationship; a character can take the &quot;uke&quot; role even if he is not presented as feminine, simply by being juxtaposed against and pursued by a more dominant and masculine character. Anal sex is ubiquitous in BL, and is typically rendered explicitly and not merely implied; Zanghellini notes that illustrations of anal sex almost always position the characters to face each other rather than &quot;doggy style&quot;, and that the &quot;uke&quot; rarely fellates the &quot;seme&quot;, but instead receives the sexual and romantic attentions of the &quot;seme&quot;.

Though McLelland notes that authors are typically &quot;interested in exploring, not repudiating&quot; the dynamics between the &quot;seme&quot; and &quot;uke&quot;, not all works adhere to &quot;seme&quot; and &quot;uke&quot; tropes. The possibility of switching roles is often a source of playful teasing and sexual excitement for the characters, indicating an interest among many genre authors in exploring the performative nature of the roles. , a shorthand for &quot;reversible&quot; (リバーシブル), is used to describe couples where the &quot;seme&quot; and &quot;uke&quot; roles are not strictly defined. Occasionally, authors will forego the stylisations of the &quot;seme&quot; and &quot;uke&quot; to portray both lovers as &quot;equally attractive handsome men&quot;, or will subvert expectations of dominance by depicting the active pursuer in the relationship as taking the passive role during sex. In other cases, the &quot;uke&quot; is presented as more sexually aggressive than the &quot;seme&quot;; in these instances, the roles are sometimes referred to as and .

===Diminished female characters===
Historically, female characters had minor roles in BL, or were absent altogether. Suzuki notes that mothers in particular are often portrayed in a negative light; she suggests this is because the character and reader alike are seeking to substitute the absence of unconditional maternal love with the &quot;forbidden&quot; all-consuming love presented in BL. In parodies based on existing works that include female characters, the female&#x27;s role is typically either minimized or the character is killed off; Yukari Fujimoto noted that in these parodies, &quot;it seems that &quot;yaoi&quot; readings and likeable female characters are mutually exclusive.&quot; Nariko Enomoto, a BL author, suggests that women are typically not depicted in BL as their presence adds an element of realism that distracts from a fantasy narrative.

Since the late 2000s, women have appeared more frequently in BL works as supporting characters. Lunsing notes that early &quot;shōnen-ai&quot; and &quot;yaoi&quot; were often regarded as misogynistic, with the diminished role of female characters cited as evidence of the internalized misogyny of the genre&#x27;s largely female readership. He suggests that the decline of these misogynistic representations over time is evidence that authors and readers &quot;overcame this hate, possibly thanks to their involvement with .&quot;

===Gay equality===
BL stories are often strongly homosocial, giving men freedom to bond and pursue shared goals together (as in &quot;dojinshi&quot; adaptations of &quot;shōnen&quot; manga), or to rival each other (as in &quot;Embracing Love&quot;). This spiritual bond and equal partnership is depicted as overcoming the male-female gender hierarchy. As is typical in romance fiction, couples depicted in these stories often must overcome obstacles that are emotional or psychological rather than physical. Akiko Mizoguchi notes that while early stories depicted homosexuality as a source of shame to heighten dramatic tension in this regard, beginning in the mid-2000s the genre began to depict gay identity with greater sensitivity and nuance, with series such as &quot;Brilliant Blue&quot; featuring stories of coming out and the characters&#x27; gradual acceptance within the wider community. BL typically depicts Japanese society as more accepting of LGBT people than it is in reality, which Mizoguchi contends is a form of activism among BL authors. Some longer-form stories such as &quot;Fake&quot; and &quot;&quot; have the couple form a family unit, depicting them cohabiting and adopting children. It is also possible that they marry and have children, as in Omegaverse publications. Fujimoto cites &quot;Ossan&#x27;s Love&quot; (2016–2018) and other BL television dramas that emerged in the 2010s as a &quot;&#x27;missing link&#x27; to bridge the gap between BL fiction and gay people,&quot; arguing that when BL narratives are presented using human actors, it produces a &quot;subconscious change in the perception of viewers&quot; towards acceptance of homosexuality.

Although gay male characters are empowered in BL, the genre frequently does not address the reality of socio-cultural homophobia. According to Hisako Miyoshi, vice editor-in-chief for Libre Publishing, while earlier works in the genre focused &quot;more on the homosexual way of life from a realistic perspective&quot;, over time the genre has become less realistic and more comedic, and the stories are &quot;simply for entertainment&quot;. BL manga often have fantastical, historical or futuristic settings, and many fans consider the genre to be escapist fiction. Homophobia, when it is presented as an issue at all, is used as a plot device to heighten drama, or to show the purity of the leads&#x27; love. Rachel Thorn has suggested that as BL is primarily a romance genre, its readers may be turned off by political themes such as homophobia. BL author Makoto Tateno expressed skepticism that realistic depictions of gay men&#x27;s lives would become common in BL &quot;because girls like fiction more than realism&quot;. Alan Williams argues that the lack of a gay identity in BL is due to BL being postmodern, stating that &quot;a common utterance in the genre—when a character claims that he is &#x27;not gay, but just in love with a man&#x27;—has both homophobic (or modern) temporal undertones but also non-identitarian (postmodern) ones.&quot; In 2019, BL manga magazine editors have stated that stories where a man is concerned about coming out as gay have become uncommon and the trope can be seen as outdated if used as a source of conflict between the characters.

===Rape===
Eroticized depictions of rape are often associated with BL. Anal sex is understood as a means of expressing commitment to a partner, and in BL, the &quot;apparent violence&quot; of rape is transformed into a &quot;measure of passion&quot;. Rape scenes in BL are rarely presented as crimes with an assaulter and a victim: scenes where a &quot;seme&quot; rapes an &quot;uke&quot; are not depicted as symptomatic of the violent desires of the &quot;seme&quot;, but rather as evidence of the uncontrollable attraction felt by the &quot;seme&quot; towards the &quot;uke&quot;. Such scenes are often a plot device used to make the &quot;uke&quot; see the &quot;seme&quot; as more than just a good friend, and typically result in the &quot;uke&quot; falling in love with the &quot;seme&quot;.

While Japanese society often shuns or looks down upon women who are raped in reality, the BL genre depicts men who are raped as still &quot;imbued with innocence&quot; and are typically still loved by their rapists after the act, a trope that may have originated with &quot;Kaze to Ki no Uta&quot;. Kristy Valenti of &quot;The Comics Journal&quot; notes that rape narratives typically focus on how &quot;irresistible&quot; the &quot;uke&quot; is and how the &quot;seme&quot; &quot;cannot control himself&quot; in his presence, thus absolving the &quot;seme&quot; of responsibility for his rape of the &quot;uke&quot;. She notes this is likely why the narrative climax of many BL stories depicts the &quot;seme&quot; recognizing, and taking responsibility for, his sexual desires. Where the uke is raped by a third party, the relationship is shown to be emotionally supportive. Conversely, some stories such as &quot;Under Grand Hotel&quot; subvert the rape fantasy trope entirely by presenting rape as a negative and traumatic act.

A 2012 survey of English-language BL fans found that just 15 percent of respondents reported that the presence of rape in BL media made them uncomfortable, as the majority of respondents could distinguish between the &quot;fantasy, genre-driven rape&quot; of BL and rape as a crime in reality. This &quot;surprisingly high tolerance&quot; for depictions of rape is contextualized by a content analysis, which found that just 13 percent of all original Japanese BL available commercially in English contains depictions of rape. These findings are argued as &quot;possibly belying the perception that rape is almost ubiquitous in BL/&quot;yaoi&quot;.&quot;

===Tragedy===
Tragic narratives that focused on the suffering of the protagonists were popular early &quot;June&quot; stories, particularly stories that ended in one or both members of the central couple dying from suicide. By the mid-1990s, happy endings were more common; when tragic endings are shown, the cause is typically not an interpersonal conflict between the couple, but &quot;the cruel and intrusive demands of an uncompromising outside world&quot;. Thorn theorizes that depictions of tragedy and abuse in BL exist to allow the audience &quot;to come to terms in some way with their own experiences of abuse.&quot;

===Subgenres and related genres===

, also known as or is a genre focused on male same-sex love, as created primarily by gay men for a gay male audience. Gay manga typically focuses on masculine men with varying degrees of muscle, body fat, and body hair, in contrast to the androgynous &quot;bishōnen&quot; of BL. Graham Kolbeins writes in &quot;&quot; that while BL can be understood as a primarily feminist phenomenon, in that it depicts sex that is free of the patriarchal trappings of heterosexual pornography, gay manga is primarily an expression of gay male identity. The early 2000s saw a degree of overlap between BL and gay manga in BDSM-themed publications: the BDSM anthology magazine had several male contributors, while several female BL authors have contributed stories to BDSM-themed gay manga anthologies or special issues, occasionally under male pen names.

 is a genre that depicts prepubescent or pubescent boys in a romantic or pornographic context. Originating as an offshoot of in the early 1980s, the subgenre was later adopted by male readers and became influenced by &quot;lolicon&quot; (works depicting prepubescent or pubescent girls); the conflation of &quot;shotacon&quot; in its contemporary usage with BL is thus not universally accepted, as the genre constitutes material that marketed to both male and female audiences.

Omegaverse is a male-male romance subgenre that originated from the American series &quot;Supernatural&quot; and in the 2010s became a subgenre of both commercial and non-commercial BL. Stories in the genre are premised on societies wherein humans are divided into a dominance hierarchy of dominant &quot;alphas&quot;, neutral &quot;betas&quot;, and submissive &quot;omegas&quot;. These terms are derived from those used in ethology to describe social hierarchies in animals. 

The &quot;dom/sub universe&quot; subgenre emerged in 2017 and gained popularity in 2021. The subgenre uses BDSM elements and also draws influences from Omegaverse, particularly the use of a caste system.

==Media==

In 2003, 3.8% of weekly Japanese manga magazines were dedicated exclusively to BL. Notable ongoing and defunct magazines include &quot;Magazine Be × Boy&quot;, &quot;June&quot;, &quot;Craft&quot;, &quot;Chara&quot;, &quot;Dear+&quot;, &quot;Opera&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Gush&quot;. Several of these magazines were established as companion publications to &quot;shōjo&quot; manga magazines, as they include material considered too explicit for an all-ages audience; &quot;Ciel&quot; was established as a companion to &quot;Monthly Asuka&quot;, while &quot;Dear+&quot; was established as a companion to &quot;Wings&quot;. A 2008 assessment estimated that the Japanese commercial BL market grossed approximately annually, with novel sales generating per month, manga generating per month, CDs generating per month, and video games generating per month. A 2010 report estimated that the Japanese BL market was worth approximately in both 2009 and 2010. In 2019, editors from &quot;Lynx&quot;, &quot;Magazine Be × Boy&quot;, and &quot;On BLUE&quot; have stated that, with the growth of BL artists in Taiwan and South Korea, they have recruited and published several of their works in Japan with expectations that the BL manga industry will diversify.

===Fan works ()===

The (self-published fan works) subculture emerged in the 1970s contemporaneously with BL subculture and Western fan fiction culture. Characteristic similarities of fan works in both Japan and the West include non-adherence to a standard narrative structures and a particular popularity of science fiction themes. Early BL &quot;dōjinshi&quot; were amateur publications that were not controlled by media restrictions, were typically derivative works based on existing manga and anime, and were often written by teenagers for an adolescent audience. Several legitimate manga artists produce or produced &quot;dōjinshi&quot;: the manga artist group Clamp began as an amateur &quot;dōjinshi&quot; circle creating works based on &quot;Saint Seiya&quot;, while Kodaka Kazuma and Fumi Yoshinaga have produced &quot;dōjinshi&quot; concurrently with professionally-published works. Many publishing companies review BL &quot;dōjinshi&quot; to recruit talented amateurs; this practice has led to careers in mainstream manga for Youka Nitta, Shungiku Nakamura, and others.

Typically, BL &quot;dōjinshi&quot; feature male-male pairings from non-romantic manga and anime. Much of the material derives from male-oriented &quot;shōnen&quot; and &quot;seinen&quot; works, which contain close male-male friendships perceived by fans to imply elements of homoeroticism, such as with &quot;Captain Tsubasa&quot; and &quot;Saint Seiya&quot;, two titles which popularized in the 1980s. &quot;Weekly Shonen Jump&quot; is known to have a large female readership who engage in BL readings; publishers of &quot;shōnen&quot; manga may create &quot;homoerotic-themed&quot; merchandise as fan service to their BL fans. BL fans may &quot;ship&quot; any male-male pairing, sometimes pairing off a favourite character, or create a story about two original male characters and incorporate established characters into the story. Any male character may become the subject of a BL &quot;dōjinshi&quot;, including characters from non-manga titles such as &quot;Harry Potter&quot; or &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, video games such as &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;, or real people such as actors and politicians. Amateur authors may also create characters out of personifications of abstract concepts (as in the personification of countries in &quot;&quot;) or complementary objects like salt and pepper. In Japan, the labeling of BL &quot;dōjinshi&quot; is typically composed of the two lead characters&#x27; names, separated by a multiplication sign, with the &quot;seme&quot; being first and the &quot;uke&quot; being second.

Outside of Japan, the 2000 broadcast of &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam Wing&quot; in North America on Cartoon Network is noted as crucial to the development of Western BL fan works, particularly fan fiction. As BL fan fiction is often compared to the Western fan practice of slash, it is important to understand the subtle differences between them. Levi notes that &quot;the youthful teen look that so easily translates into androgyny in boys&#x27; love manga, and allows for so many layered interpretations of sex and gender, is much harder for slash writers to achieve.&quot;

===English-language publishing===

The first officially-licensed English-language translations of manga were published in the North American market in 2003; by 2006, there were roughly 130 English-translated works commercially available, and by 2007, over 10 publishers in North America published . Notable English-language publishers of BL include Viz Media under their SuBLime imprint, Digital Manga Publishing under their 801 Media and Juné imprints, Media Blasters under their Kitty Media imprint, Seven Seas Entertainment, and Tokyopop. Notable defunct English-language publishers of BL include Central Park Media under their Be Beautiful imprint, Broccoli under their Boysenberry imprint, and Aurora Publishing under their Deux Press imprint.

Among the 135 manga published in North America between 2003 and 2006, 14% were rated for readers aged 13 years or over, 39% were rated for readers aged 15 or older, and 47% were rated for readers age 18 and up. Restrictions among American booksellers often led publishers to label books conservatively, often rating books originally intended for a mid-teen readership as 18+ and distributing them in shrinkwrap. Diamond Comic Distributors valued the sales of manga in the United States at approximately US$6 million in 2007.

Marketing was significant in the transnational travel of BL from Japan to the United States, and led to BL to attract a following of LGBTQ fans in the United States. The 1994 original video animation adaptation of &quot;&quot; was distributed by Ariztical Entertainment, which specializes in LGBT cinema and marketed the title as &quot;the first gay male anime to be released on DVD in the US.&quot; The film was reviewed in the American LGBT magazine &quot;The Advocate&quot;, which compared the film to gay art house cinema.

A large portion of Western fans choose to pirate BL material because they are unable or unwilling to obtain it through sanctioned methods. Scanlations and other fan translation efforts of both commercially published Japanese works and amateur &quot;dojinshi&quot; are common.

====Original English-language ====
When initially gained popularity in the United States in the early 2000s, several American artists began creating original English-language manga for female readers featuring male-male couples referred to as &quot;American &quot;. The first known commercially published original English-language comic is &quot;Sexual Espionage #1&quot; by Daria McGrain, published by Sin Factory in May 2002. As international artists began creating works, the term &quot;American &quot; fell out of use and was replaced by terms like &quot;original English language &quot;, &quot;global &quot;, and &quot;global BL&quot;. The majority of publishers creating original English-language manga are now defunct, including Yaoi Press, DramaQueen, and Iris Print. Digital Manga Publishing last published original English-language manga in 2012; outside of the United States, German publisher Carlsen Manga also published original works.

=== Audio dramas ===
BL audio dramas, occasionally referred to as &quot;drama CDs&quot;, &quot;sound dramas&quot;, or &quot;BLCDs&quot;, are recorded voice performances of male-male romance scenarios performed by primarily male voice actors. They are typically adaptations of original BL manga and novels. The first BL audio dramas were released in the 1980s, beginning with &quot;Tsuzumigafuchi&quot; in 1988, which was published as a &quot;&quot;June&quot; cassette&quot;. BL audio dramas proliferated beginning in the 1990s with the rise in popularity of compact discs, peaking at 289 total CDs released in 2008, which dropped to 108 CDs in 2013.

===Live action television and film===

====Japan====
While Japanese BL manga has been adapted into live action films and television dramas since the early 2000s, these works were marketed towards a niche audience of BL fans rather than towards a general audience. When these works were adapted for a general audience, same-sex romance elements were typically downplayed or removed entirely, as in the live-action television adaption of &quot;Antique Bakery&quot; that aired on Fuji TV in 2001. The development of Japanese live-action television dramas that focus on BL and same-sex romance themes explicitly was spurred by the critical and commercial success of the TV Asahi television drama &quot;Ossan&#x27;s Love&quot; (2016), which features an all-male love triangle as its central plot conceit. While &quot;Ossan&#x27;s Love&quot; is an original series, it influenced the creation of live-action BL works adapted from manga that are marketed towards mass audiences; notable examples include the television dramas &quot;&quot; (2018) on Fuji TV, &quot;What Did You Eat Yesterday?&quot; (2019) on TV Tokyo, &quot;Cherry Magic&quot; (2020) on TV Tokyo, and the live-action film adaptation of &quot;The Cornered Mouse Dreams of Cheese&quot; (2020).

In 2022, Kadokawa Corporation employee Kaoru Azuma established Tunku, Kadokawa&#x27;s label for publishing live-action BL drama series, partnering with MBS TV to create the programming block Drama Shower. The label was created to promote Japanese BL dramas based on existing BL novels and manga due to the growing popularity of BL caused by &quot;Ossan&#x27;s Love&quot;. While creating Tunku, Azuma stated that she noticed that prejudice against boys&#x27; love has dwindled, and that many people have seemed to accept the genre as &quot;normal&quot;.

====Thailand====
The Thai romantic drama film &quot;Love of Siam&quot; (2007), which features a gay male romance storyline, found unexpected mainstream success upon its release and grossed over TH฿40 million at the box office. This was followed by &quot;Love Sick: The Series&quot; (2014–2015), the first Thai television series to feature two gay characters as the lead roles. Cultural anthropologist Thomas Baudinette argues that &quot;Love Sick: The Series&quot; represented a &quot;watershed moment&quot; in the depiction of queer romance in Thai media, exploring how the series adapted tropes from Japanese BL to create a new genre of media. While Japanese BL manga attracted an audience in Thailand as early as the 1990s, the success of &quot;Love of Siam&quot; and &quot;Love Sick&quot; kick-started the production of domestic BL dramas: between 2014 and 2020, 57 television series in the BL genre were produced and released in Thailand. 

Major producers of Thai BL include GMMTV, a subsidiary of GMM Grammy, which has produced &quot;2gether: The Series&quot; (2020), &quot;A Tale of Thousand Stars&quot; (2021), &quot;&quot; (2016–2017), &quot;Dark Blue Kiss&quot; (2019), and &quot;Theory of Love&quot; (2019); and Line Corporation, which produces BL dramas in Thailand for distribution on its Line TV platform. The genre has seen some backlash from conservative elements in Thai society: in 2020, the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission introduced new guidelines around material containing &quot;sexually explicit or suggestive&quot; scenes, while public broadcaster MCOT cancelled the BL series &quot;Love by Chance&quot; in 2018. Thai BL dramas are noted as having gained popularity in Indonesia, where LGBT representation in domestic television is less common; as well as in the Philippines, where many fans view BL as an originally Thai form of popular culture. The coming-of-age BL series, &quot;I Told Sunset About You&quot; (2020) was awarded by the Seoul International Drama Awards as the International Drama of the Year in 2021. It has been suggested that BL dramas could become a source of Thai cultural soft power in Southeast Asia and beyond.

====China====
There are no specific censorship policies in China concerning depictions of LGBT subject material in media; nevertheless, &quot;Variety&quot; reports that such material is &quot;deemed sensitive and is inconsistently but regularly removed&quot; from distribution. &quot;Addicted&quot; (2016), the first Chinese BL web series, accumulated 10 million views before being pulled from the streaming platform iQiyi. In reaction to state censorship, Chinese BL works typically depict male-male romance as homoerotic subtext: the web novel &quot;Guardian&quot; (2012) depicted a romance between its two lead male characters, though when it was adapted into a television drama on the streaming platform Youku in 2018, the relationship was rendered as a close, homoerotic friendship. The 2015 BL &quot;xianxia&quot; novel &quot;Grandmaster of Demonic Cultivation&quot; was adapted into an animated series in 2018 and a live-action series in 2019, both of which similarly revise the nature of the relationship between the lead male characters. Consequently, fans of both &quot;Guardian&quot; and &quot;The Untamed&quot; discussed the series&#x27; male homoerotic content under the hashtag &quot;socialist brotherhood&quot; or &quot;socialist bromance&quot; to avoid detection from state censors.

====Other countries====

In South Korea, the web series &quot;Where Your Eyes Linger&quot; launched as the first domestically-produced BL series in 2020. The BL genre didn&#x27;t receive much traction in the country until 2022, when the series &quot;Semantic Error&quot; achieved a major domestic success and became a social phenomenon in South Korea. The unexpected success of the series introduced the BL genre to the mainstream South Korean audience, which subsequently resulted in a rising production of South Korean BL dramas and films.

In Taiwan, the BL anthology series &quot;HIStory&quot; premiered in 2017. 

In the Philippines, BL television dramas gained popularity through the broadcast of foreign BL dramas such as &quot;2gether&quot; and &quot;Where Your Eyes Linger&quot;. This spurred the creation of domestically-produced BL dramas, such as &quot;Gameboys&quot; (2020), &quot;Hello Stranger&quot; (2020), and &quot;Oh, Mando!&quot; (2020); the 2020 film &quot;The Boy Foretold by the Stars&quot; billed itself as &quot;the first Filipino BL movie&quot;.

===Video games===

BL video games typically consist of visual novels or &quot;eroge&quot; oriented around male-male couples. The first BL game to receive an officially-licensed English-language release was &quot;&quot;, published by JAST USA in 2006. That same year, the company published &quot;Absolute Obedience&quot;, while Hirameki International licensed &quot;Animamundi&quot;; the later game, although already nonexplicit, was censored for US release to achieve a &quot;mature&quot; rather than &quot;adults only&quot; ESRB rating, removing some of both the sexual and the violent content. Compared to BL manga, fewer BL games have been officially translated into English; the lack of interest by publishers in licensing further titles has been attributed to widespread copyright infringement of both licensed and unlicensed games.

==Demography==

Suzuki notes that &quot;demographic analyses of BL media are underdeveloped and thus much needed in &quot;yaoi&quot;/BL studies,&quot; but acknowledges that &quot;the overwhelming majority of BL readers are women.&quot; 80% of the BL audience is female, while the membership of Yaoi-Con, a now-defunct American convention, was 85% female. It is usually assumed that all female fans are heterosexual, but in Japan there is a presence of lesbian manga authors and lesbian, bisexual or questioning female readers. A 2008 survey of English-speaking readers of BL indicated that 50-60% of female readers self-identify as heterosexual.

Although the genre is marketed to and consumed primarily by girls and women, there is a gay, bisexual, and heterosexual male readership as well. A 2007 survey of BL readers among patrons of a United States library found about one quarter of respondents were male; two online surveys found approximately ten percent of the broader English-speaking BL readership were male. Lunsing suggests that younger Japanese gay men who are offended by &quot;pornographic&quot; content in gay men&#x27;s magazines may prefer to read BL instead. Some gay men, however, are put off by the feminine art style or unrealistic depictions of LGBT culture in Japan and instead prefer gay manga, which some perceive to be more realistic. Lunsing notes that some of the BL narrative elements criticized by homosexual men, such as rape fantasies, misogyny, and characters&#x27; non-identification as gay, are also present in gay manga.

In the mid-1990s, estimates of the size of the Japanese BL fandom ranged from 100,000 to 500,000 people. By April 2005, a search for non-Japanese websites resulted in 785,000 English, 49,000 Spanish, 22,400 Korean, 11,900 Italian, and 6,900 Chinese sites. In January 2007, there were approximately five million hits for .

Female fans of BL are often referred to as , a derogatory insult that was later reappropriated as a self-descriptive term. The male equivalent is or , both of which are puns of similar construction to &quot;fujoshi&quot;.

==Analysis==
===Audience motivation===
BL works, culture, and fandom have been studied and discussed by scholars and journalists worldwide, especially after translations of BL became commercially available outside Japan in the 21st century. In &quot;Manga! Manga! The World of Japanese Comics&quot;, the 1983 book by Frederik L. Schodt that was the first substantial English-language work on manga, Schodt observes that portrayals of gay male relationships had used and further developed bisexual themes already extant in manga to appeal to their female audience. Japanese critics have viewed BL as a genre that permits their audience to avoid adult female sexuality by distancing sex from their own bodies, as well as to create fluidity in perceptions of gender and sexuality and rejects &quot;socially mandated&quot; gender roles as a &quot;first step toward feminism&quot;. Kazuko Suzuki, for example, believes that the audience&#x27;s aversion to or contempt for masculine heterosexism is something which has consciously emerged as a result of the genre&#x27;s popularity.

Mizoguchi, writing in 2003, feels that BL is a &quot;female-gendered space&quot;, as the writers, readers, artists and most of the editors of BL are female. BL has been compared to romance novels by English-speaking librarians. In 2004, Paul Gravett summarized the dominant theories for the popularity of BL with a female audience: that Japanese women were disillusioned or bored with classic male-female relationships in fiction, that the populating the genre were a backlash against male sex fantasies of a feminized ideal of adolescent girls, that the genre offered a safe space for sexual fantasies with the free choice of identification figure in the relationship, and that the male characters in BL are interpreted by female readers as girls, thus making the stories expressions of readers&#x27; same-sex fantasies.

Other commentators have suggested that more radical gender-political issues underlie BL. Parallels have been noted in the popularity of lesbianism in pornography, and BL has been called a form of &quot;female fetishism&quot;. While early approaches to the popularity of the genre often referred to the role of women in patriarchal Japanese society, to which the genre offers a resistance and escape, this approach has been rejected by others who note that BL and BL-like media became popular outside of Japan in other social circumstances, such as slash fiction in the west. Against this background, theories emphasizing pleasure gained support: BL could be compared to pornography or even considered a specifically female form of pornography, appealing to desires for eroticism, voyeurism, or a desire to push against established gender roles. Mariko Ōhara, a science fiction writer, has said that she wrote Kirk/Spock fiction as a teen because she could not enjoy &quot;conventional pornography, which had been made for men&quot;, and that she had found a &quot;limitless freedom&quot; in BL, much like in science fiction.

In 1998, Shihomi Sakakibara asserted that fans, including himself, were gay transgender men. Sandra Buckley believes that &quot;bishōnen&quot; narratives champion &quot;the imagined potentialities of alternative [gender] differentiations&quot;, while James Welker described the &quot;bishōnen&quot; character as &quot;queer&quot;, commenting that manga critic Akiko Mizoguchi saw &quot;shōnen-ai&quot; as playing a role in how she herself had become a lesbian. Dru Pagliassotti sees this and the &quot;yaoi ronsō&quot; as indicating that for Japanese gay and lesbian readers, BL is not as far removed from reality as heterosexual female readers like to claim. Welker has also written that boys&#x27; love titles liberate the female audience &quot;not just from patriarchy, but from gender dualism and heteronormativity&quot;.

===Criticism===
Some gay and lesbian commentators have criticized how gay identity is portrayed in BL, most notably in the or &quot; debate&quot; of 1992–1997 (see History above). A trope of BL that has attracted criticism is male protagonists who do not identify as gay, but are rather simply in love with each other, with Comiket co-founder Yoshihiro Yonezawa once describing BL &quot;dōjinshi&quot; as akin to &quot;girls playing with dolls&quot;. This is said to heighten the theme of all-conquering love, but is also condemned as a means of avoiding acknowledgement of homophobia. Criticism of the stereotypically feminine behaviour of the &quot;uke&quot; has also been prominent.

Much of the criticism of BL originally rendered in the has similarly been voiced in the English-language fandom. Rachel Thorn has suggested that BL and slash fiction fans are discontented with &quot;the standards of femininity to which they are expected to adhere and a social environment that does not validate or sympathize with that discontent&quot;.

===Legal issues===
BL has been the subject of disputes on legal and moral grounds. Mark McLelland suggests that BL may become &quot;a major battlefront for proponents and detractors of &#x27;gender free&#x27; policies in employment, education and elsewhere&quot;, while BL artist Youka Nitta has said that &quot;even in Japan, reading boys&#x27; love isn&#x27;t something that parents encourage.&quot; In Thailand, the sale of unauthorized reproductions of &quot;shōnen-ai&quot; manga to teenagers in 2001 led to media coverage and a moral panic. In 2006, an email campaign pressuring the Sakai City Central Library to remove BL works from circulation attracted national media attention, and promoted a debate over removal of BL works constituted a form of discrimination. In 2010, the Osaka Prefectural Government included boys&#x27; love manga among with other books deemed potentially &quot;harmful to minors&quot; due to its sexual content, which resulted in several magazines prohibited from being sold to people under 18 years of age.

Anhui TV reported that in China, at least 20 young female authors writing &quot;danmei&quot; novels on an online novel website were arrested in 2014. In 2018, the pseudonymous Chinese BL novel author Tianyi was sentenced to years in prison under laws prohibiting the production of &quot;obscene material for profit&quot;. Hu, Ge and Wang summarise the trajectory of consorship over danmei from 2004 to the present, and suggest that the Chinese party-state has endeavoured to boost a discourse as regard danmei hatred in particular since 2021 as exemplifed in the ban of danmei-adapted web dramas and media representation of male effeminacy in September 2021. Zanghellini notes that due to the &quot;characteristics of the /BL genre&quot; of showing characters who are often underage engaging in romantic and sexual situations, child pornography laws in Australia and Canada &quot;may lend themselves to targeting /BL work&quot;. He notes that in the UK, cartoons are exempt from child pornography laws unless they are used for child grooming.

<text>Il Capitano (; ) is one of the four stock characters of commedia dell&#x27;arte. He most probably was never a &quot;Captain&quot;, but rather appropriated the name for himself. 

Its genesis dates back to the Pyrgopolinices of Titus Maccio Plautus&#x27; Miles gloriosus and to Terence&#x27;s Thrason of the Eunuch. He was reborn in various forms in the Italian theater of the Renaissance. He usually personified the vainglorious soldier who continually affirmed his military quality in words and without foundation. He could boast of titles he did not possess or of feats he had never accomplished. In the most negative versions he actually poorly concealed the terror of having to face a battle or a duel. However, the Captains could also have positive characteristics, as dreamers with noble feelings.

A captain portrayed in a more positive way is Francesco Andreini&#x27;s &quot;Captain Spaventa&quot;, capable of noble feelings, almost a dreamer. Another captain, portrayed as a laughing stock pitted against the Moors, is &quot;Captain Matamoros&quot; by Silvio Fiorillo; he had the clothing of the Spanish soldiers of the time, enriched however with trinkets and ribbons and very colourful, and with purely Iberian diction and ways of saying. Several other types of Capitano exist. Inspired by the mask are numerous other variants such as Capitan Giangurgolo, Capitan Corazza, Capitan Cardone, Rinoceronte, Terremoto, Spezzaferro, Spaccamonti, Capitan Rodomonte. Numerous derivations of the mask adopted from the Neapolitan carnival or more generally from literature, such as Captain Fracassa, can also be traced back to the captain. 

Il Capitano often talks at length about made-up conquests of both the militaristic and the carnal variety to impress others, but often ends up impressing only himself. He gets easily carried away in his tales and doesn&#x27;t realize when those around him don&#x27;t buy his act. He would be the first to run away from all battles, and he has trouble talking to and being around men. He is also extremely opportunistic and greedy. If hired by Pantalone to protect his daughter from her many suitors, il Capitano would set up a bidding war for his services or aid between the suitors and Pantalone while wooing her himself. If he is hired to fight the Turks, he will bluster about fighting them to his last drop of blood, but when the Turks seem to be winning, he will join them. He will change sides again when they are driven off and boast about his loyalty and bravery.

==Role==
&quot;I think of him as a peacock who has moulted all but one of his tail feathers, but does not know it&quot;, notes author John Rudlin. In this case, his cowardice is usually overcome by the fury of his passion, which he makes every effort to demonstrate. Typically, however, his cowardice is such that when one of the characters orders him to do something, he often steps down out of fear, but is able to make up an excuse that ensures the other characters still see him as a brave and fierce individual. Columbine sometimes uses him to make Harlequin (Arlecchino) jealous, much to il Capitano&#x27;s bewilderment and fright.

===Origin===
The origin of il Capitano comes from 2 literary sources: Plautus&#x27;s &quot;miles gloriosus&quot; and Terence&#x27;s &quot;Eunuchus&quot;. The first famous Capitano, Capitan Spaventa, appeared in Francesco Andreini&#x27;s &quot;Bravure di Capitan Spaventa&quot; (&#x27;The Boast of the Terrifying Captain&#x27;).

===&quot;Lazzi&quot;===
# Whenever il Capitano sees the audience, he stops to be admired.
# Il Capitano gloats to Harlequin about his expertise with the ladies and then proceeds to demonstrate on Harlequin how he would make love to a woman.
# He wakes up to find he is not the only one in the room. Someone is crouching in the corner. He shakes his fist at the person, the person shakes their fist back at the same time. It turns out the person in the room is just il Capitano&#x27;s reflection in a full-length mirror.
# When frightened, he often screams in a high and womanly falsetto, or else faints.

===Stance===
He stands in a high posture, occupying as much space as possible, with a straight back and his chest pushed forward.

===Plot function===
To be exposed or &#x27;de-masked&#x27;. He exists to be stripped of his excessive confidence and shown in a moment of panic and humility.

===Famous actors===
* Francesco Andreini
* Antonio Fava

==Description of the character==
===Mask===

His mask is described as having &quot;a long nose, often unambiguously phallic&quot;. The nose for Capitan Spaventa&#x27;s mask is fairly large, but it lengthens with Matamoros and becomes absolutely gargantuan for Coccodrillo. Originally, the color of the mask was probably flesh tone, now it can be many flamboyant colors such as bright pink, yellow, and light blue. The mask often has a strong mustache and brow lines that can be black or have a purple/blue tone.

===Costume===
Military-esque uniform (a satire on the period). The 1500s: feathered helmet or hat (&quot;mom panache&quot;), exaggerated garters, extraordinarily long sword and a plethora of ruffles. 1600s: coat, breeches, and he would mostly have a musket instead of a sword. In one famous scenario, il Capitano makes up a lie regarding the reason for his lack of an undershirt by claiming that it got that way because, &quot;I used to be an exceedingly fierce and violent man, and when I was made angry the hair which covers my body in goodly quantity stood on end and so riddled my shirt with holes that you would have taken it for a sieve.&quot; The real reason is that he has become too poor to afford one. Sometimes he wears it with a helmet or a bicorne or tricorne hat with a huge plume. Spanish characters often wear an exaggerated large neck-ruff.

He is usually always wearing his trademarked sword. If he were to ever work up enough nerve to draw it, it is usually too long to draw easily or too heavy or wobbly to wield properly. Even if he cut somebody with it, he would faint at the very sight of the blood.

===Noms de guerre===
Il Capitano usually has a properly showy name for himself, preferably several lines long and followed by many made-up titles and lists of relations.

Some names are fierce-sounding, such as &quot;Escobombardon&quot; (&quot;Fired out of a cannon&quot;), &quot;Rodomonte&quot; (&quot;Mountain-crumbler&quot;), &quot;Sangre y Fuego&quot; (Spanish: &quot;Blood and Fire&quot;), &quot;Spaccamonti&quot; (&quot;Mountain splitter&quot;), &quot;Spezzaferro&quot; (&quot;Iron-breaker&quot;), or &quot;Terremoto&quot; (&quot;Earthquake&quot;). Some names are ironic, such as &quot;Bellavista&quot; (&quot;Beautiful view&quot;, a vain but ugly man) or &quot;&quot;Fracasso&quot;/&quot; Fracassa&quot;&quot; (the correct masculine version and an invented feminine version for &quot;Fracas&quot;, &quot;Skirmish&quot; or &quot;Big noise&quot;).

Some are dismissive, such as &quot;Cerimonia&quot; (&quot;Ceremony&quot;, all proper manners and rigid, slavish devotion to pointless details), &quot;Coccodrillo&quot; (&quot;Crocodile&quot;, because he preys on others), &quot;Fanfarone&quot; (&quot;Trumpeter&quot; or &quot;Loudmouth&quot;), &quot;Giangurgulo&quot; (&quot;John the Glutton&quot;), &quot;Grillo&quot; (&quot;Grasshopper&quot;, because he is small and &#x27;hops&#x27; sides), &quot;Malagamba&quot; (&quot;Lame leg&quot;), &quot;Squaquara&quot; (&quot;Little Shi&quot;), &quot;Papirotonda&quot; (&quot;Round letter&quot;, a complaint signed by mutinous soldiers or sailors in a circle around the main text so the ringleaders or originators cannot be discerned), &quot;Tagliacantoni&quot; (&quot;Small-sized&quot;), or &quot;Zerbino&quot; (&quot;Doormat&quot;). He is also prone to awarding himself ridiculous titles such as &quot;Capitan Spaventa di Vall&#x27;Inferna&quot; (&quot;Captain Fear, (Lord) of Hell&#x27;s Valley&quot;; the name of &quot;Vall&#x27;Inferna&quot; also sounds similar to &quot;Va&#x27; all&#x27;Inferno!&quot;, , an Italian-language imprecation), &quot;Salvador de los Vírgenes Borrachos&quot; (Spanish for &quot;Savior of Drunken Virgins&quot;), or &quot;Sieur de Fracasse et Brise-tout&quot; (French for &quot;Lord of &#x27;Knock it down&#x27; and &#x27;Break everything&#x27;&quot;). 

==Variants==
The French coined characters such as &quot;Boudoufle&quot; (Norman French for &#x27;Puffed up with hurt pride&#x27;), &quot;Taille-bras&quot; (either &#x27;Limb-Cutter&#x27; or &#x27;Arm&#x27;s Length&#x27;), and &quot;Engoulevent&quot; (either &#x27;Night-bird&#x27; or &#x27;Big-mouth&#x27;). England has the Irish dramatist George Farquhar&#x27;s play &quot;The Recruiting Officer&quot;. Major Bloodnok of &quot;The Goon Show&quot; bears some resemblance to il Capitano and shares many of his traits, such as lust, greed, and cowardice. In modern theater, the character &quot;miles gloriosus&quot; (Latin for &#x27;Famous or Boastful Soldier&#x27;) from &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum&quot; is an obvious form of the character, though modeled from the earlier Roman plays.

===Types===
1. Capitan Spaventa (&quot;fear&quot;)

2. Rinoceronte (&quot;rhino&quot;)

3. Fracassa (&quot;uproar&quot;)

4. Spezzafer (&quot;iron splitter&quot;)

5. Cocodrillo (&quot;crocodile&quot;) – &quot;a crocodile who never bites, he is all fanfare easily deflated,&quot; according to Rudlin. 

6. Matamoros (Spanish for &quot;Killer of Moors&quot;) – the original Spanish mercenary – was created by Francesco Andreini. He is powerfully built and very lavishly dressed. The clothes of his servants were supposedly made from the turbans of his victims. Has a hedgehog on his coat of arms, the result of his exploits at the battle of Trebizonde, where he claims to have fought his way into the tent of the Sultan himself. He then dragged him through the camp with one hand while fighting off the entire enemy army with the other hand. Afterward, so many arrows were stuck in him when he fought free that he resembled a hedgehog.

7. Scaramouche – Scaramuccia (Italian), or Scaramouche (French) (&quot;skirmish&quot;) was a reinvention of the character by Tiberio Fiorilli. He is more of a man of action than he is a braggart and is clever, brave, and quick-witted rather than ignorant, cowardly, and foolish. He is also a good singer and musician and is usually depicted with a lute or guitar. Although quite a heartbreaker, he is usually indirectly or unobtrusively helpful to the &quot;innamorati&quot;.
*In the Punch and Judy shows, Scaramouche is depicted as a puppet with a detachable head or an extendable neck. The former is for il Capitano&#x27;s incarnation, who seeks to fight all the other characters and the latter is for a singing puppet.
*Cyrano de Bergerac, a play by Edmond Rostand, is the most popular variant on Scaramouche. It portrays the historical figure as a violent, easily angered braggart who is sensitive about slurs on his considerable courage, his rural Gascon heritage, or his ugly face (which is identical to the features of the Scaramouche mask). He nobly helps his friend, a handsome but naïve and foolish youth, woo Roxane whom they both love.
*An unnamed soldier in a short play by Miguel de Cervantes called &quot;The Vigilant Sentinel&quot; matched this character to the letter. In the play he waits, bespectacled and wearing ragged clothes, desperately trying to frighten away any rival suitors from the house of the girl he wishes to marry.
*Baron Munchausen is another take on Scaramouche. He is usually depicted as an elderly man in an anachronistic 18th-century uniform, powdered wig with queue, a beak-like and prominent nose, curling mustaches and a goatee beard, and glasses. He uses his wits, his amazing luck and superhuman skills, and his gift of blather and blarney to defeat his enemies. He is also unusual in that he is handicapped by infirmities but is superhuman when he compensates for them. Without his glasses, he is blind as a bat; with them, he can see clearer and farther than a man with perfect vision. He has a lame leg, but when he carries his cane, he is capable of running faster and jumping higher and farther than an athlete. 

8. Fanfarone – pretends to be Spanish, but is just a Zanni.

<text>Technical drawing, drafting or drawing, is the act and discipline of composing drawings that visually communicate how something functions or is constructed.

Technical drawing is essential for communicating ideas in industry and engineering.
To make the drawings easier to understand, people use familiar symbols, perspectives, units of measurement, notation systems, visual styles, and page layout. Together, such conventions constitute a visual language and help to ensure that the drawing is unambiguous and relatively easy to understand. Many of the symbols and principles of technical drawing are codified in an international standard called ISO 128.

The need for precise communication in the preparation of a functional document distinguishes technical drawing from the expressive drawing of the visual arts. Artistic drawings are subjectively interpreted; their meanings are multiply determined. Technical drawings are understood to have one intended meaning.

A draftsman is a person who makes a drawing (technical or expressive). A professional drafter who makes technical drawings is sometimes called a drafting technician.

==Methods==
===Sketching===
A sketch is a quickly executed, freehand drawing that is usually not intended as a finished work. In general, sketching is a quick way to record an idea for later use. Architect&#x27;s sketches primarily serve as a way to try out different ideas and establish a composition before a more finished work, especially when the finished work is expensive and time-consuming.

Architectural sketches, for example, are a kind of diagram. These sketches, like metaphors, are used by architects as a means of communication in aiding design collaboration. This tool helps architects to abstract attributes of hypothetical provisional design solutions and summarize their complex patterns, thereby enhancing the design process.

===Manual or by instrument===

The basic drafting procedure is to place a piece of paper (or other material) on a smooth surface with right-angle corners and straight sides—typically a drawing board. A sliding straightedge known as a T-square is then placed on one of the sides, allowing it to be slid across the side of the table, and over the surface of the paper.

&quot;Parallel lines&quot; can be drawn by moving the T-square and running a pencil or technical pen along the T-square&#x27;s edge. The T-square is used to hold other devices such as set squares or triangles. In this case, the drafter places one or more triangles of known angles on the T-square — which is itself at right angles to the edge of the table — and can then draw lines at any chosen angle to others on the page. Modern drafting tables are equipped with a drafting machine that is supported on both sides of the table to slide over a large piece of paper. Because it is secured on both sides, lines drawn along the edge are guaranteed to be parallel.

The drafter uses several technical drawing tools to draw curves and circles. Primary among these are the compasses, used for drawing arcs and circles, and the French curve, for drawing curves. A spline is a rubber coated articulated metal that can be manually bent to most curves.

Drafting templates assist the drafter with creating recurring objects in a drawing without having to reproduce the object from scratch every time. This is especially useful when using common symbols; i.e. in the context of stagecraft, a lighting designer will draw from the USITT standard library of lighting fixture symbols to indicate the position of a common fixture across multiple positions. Templates are sold commercially by a number of vendors, usually customized to a specific task, but it is also not uncommon for a drafter to create his own templates.

This basic drafting system requires an accurate table and constant attention to the positioning of the tools. A common error is to allow the triangles to push the top of the T-square down slightly, thereby throwing off all angles. Even tasks as simple as drawing two angled lines meeting at a point require a number of moves of the T-square and triangles, and in general, drafting can be a time-consuming process.

A solution to these problems was the introduction of the mechanical &quot;drafting machine&quot;, an application of the pantograph (sometimes referred to incorrectly as a &quot;pentagraph&quot; in these situations) which allowed the drafter to have an accurate right angle at any point on the page quickly. These machines often included the ability to change the angle, hence removing the need for the triangles.

In addition to the mastery of the mechanics of drawing lines, arcs and circles (and text) onto a piece of paper—with respect to the detailing of physical objects—the drafting effort requires a thorough understanding of geometry, trigonometry and spatial comprehension, and in all cases demands precision and accuracy, and attention to detail of high order.

Although drafting is sometimes accomplished by a project engineer, architect, or shop personnel (such as a machinist), skilled drafters (or designers) usually accomplish the task, and are always in demand to some degree.

===Computer aided design===
Today, the mechanics of the drafting task have largely been automated and accelerated through the use of computer-aided design systems (CAD).

There are two types of computer-aided design systems used for the production of technical drawings: two dimensions (2D) and three dimensions (3D).

2D CAD systems such as AutoCAD or MicroStation replace the paper drawing discipline. The lines, circles, arcs, and curves are created within the software. It is down to the technical drawing skill of the user to produce the drawing. There is still much scope for error in the drawing when producing first and third angle orthographic projections, auxiliary projections and cross-section views. A 2D CAD system is merely an electronic drawing board. Its greatest strength over direct to paper technical drawing is in the making of revisions. Whereas in a conventional hand drawn technical drawing, if a mistake is found, or a modification is required, a new drawing must be made from scratch, the 2D CAD system allows a copy of the original to be modified, saving considerable time. 2D CAD systems can be used to create plans for large projects such as buildings and aircraft but provide no way to check the various components will fit together.
A 3D CAD system (such as KeyCreator, Autodesk Inventor, or SolidWorks) first produces the geometry of the part; the technical drawing comes from user defined views of that geometry. Any orthographic, projected or sectioned view is created by the software. There is no scope for error in the production of these views. The main scope for error comes in setting the parameter of first or third angle projection and displaying the relevant symbol on the technical drawing. 3D CAD allows individual parts to be assembled together to represent the final product. Buildings, aircraft, ships, and cars are modelled, assembled, and checked in 3D before technical drawings are released for manufacture.

Both 2D and 3D CAD systems can be used to produce technical drawings for any discipline. The various disciplines (electrical, electronic, pneumatic, hydraulic, etc.) have industry recognized symbols to represent common components.

BS and ISO produce standards to show recommended practices but it is up to individuals to produce the drawings to a standard. There is no definitive standard for layout or style. The only standard across engineering workshop drawings is in the creation of orthographic projections and cross-section views.

In representing complex, three-dimensional objects in two-dimensional drawings, the objects can be described by at least one view plus material thickness note, two, three, or as many views and sections that are required to show all features of object.

==Applications==

===Architecture===

The art and design that goes into making buildings is known as architecture. To communicate all aspects of the shape or design, detail drawings are used. In this field, the term &quot;plan&quot; is often used when referring to the full section view of these drawings as viewed from three feet above finished floor to show the locations of doorways, windows, stairwells, etc. Architectural drawings describe and document an architect&#x27;s design.
===Engineering===

Engineering can be a very broad term. It stems from the Latin &quot;ingenerare&quot;, meaning &quot;to create&quot;. Because this could apply to everything that humans create, it is given a narrower definition in the context of technical drawing. Engineering drawings generally deal with mechanical engineered items, such as manufactured parts and equipment.
Engineering drawings are usually created in accordance with standardized conventions for layout, nomenclature, interpretation, appearance (such as typefaces and line styles), size, etc.

Its purpose is to accurately and unambiguously capture all the geometric features of a product or a component. The end goal of an engineering drawing is to convey all the required information that will allow a manufacturer to produce that component.

=== Software engineering ===
Software engineering practitioners make use of diagrams for designing software. Formal standards and modelling languages such as Unified Modelling Language (UML) exist but most diagramming happens using informal ad hoc diagrams that illustrate a conceptual model.

Practitioners reported that diagramming helped with analysing requirements, design, refactoring, documentation, onboarding, communication with stake holders. Diagrams are often transient or redrawn as required. Redrawn diagrams can act as a form of shared understanding in a team.

==Related fields==

===Technical illustration===


&quot;Technical illustration&quot; is the use of illustration to visually communicate information of a technical nature. Technical illustrations can be component technical drawings or diagrams. The aim of technical illustration is &quot;to generate expressive images that effectively convey certain information via the visual channel to the human observer&quot;.

The main purpose of technical illustration is to describe or explain these items to a more or less nontechnical audience. The visual image should be accurate in terms of dimensions and proportions, and should provide &quot;an overall impression of what an object is or does, to enhance the viewer&#x27;s interest and understanding&quot;.

According to Viola (2005), &quot;illustrative techniques are often designed in a way that even a person with no technical understanding clearly understands the piece of art. The use of varying line widths to emphasize mass, proximity, and scale helped to make a simple line drawing more understandable to the lay person. Cross hatching, stippling, and other low abstraction techniques gave greater depth and dimension to the subject matter&quot;.

====Cutaway drawing====

A &quot;cutaway drawing&quot; is a technical illustration, in which part of the surface of a three-dimensional model is removed in order to show some of the model&#x27;s interior in relation to its exterior.

The purpose of a cutaway drawing is to &quot;allow the viewer to have a look into an otherwise solid opaque object. Instead of letting the inner object shine through the surrounding surface, parts of outside object are simply removed. This produces a visual appearance as if someone had cutout a piece of the object or sliced it into parts. Cutaway illustrations avoid ambiguities with respect to spatial ordering, provide a sharp contrast between foreground and background objects, and facilitate a good understanding of spatial ordering&quot;.
==Technical drawings==

===Types===
The two types of technical drawings are based on graphical projection. This is used to create an image of a three-dimensional object onto a two-dimensional surface.

====Two-dimensional representation====
Two-dimensional representation uses orthographic projection to create an image where only two of the three dimensions of the object are seen.

====Three-dimensional representation====
In a three-dimensional representation, also referred to as a pictorial, all three dimensions of an object are visible.

===Views===

====Multiview====

Multiview is a type of orthographic projection. There are two conventions for using multiview, first-angle and third-angle. In both cases, the front or main side of the object is the same. First-angle is drawing the object sides based on where they land. Example, looking at the front side, rotate the object 90 degrees to the right. What is seen will be drawn to the right of the front side. Third-angle is drawing the object sides based on where they are. Example, looking at the front side, rotate the object 90 degrees to the right. What is seen is actually the left side of the object and will be drawn to the left of the front side.

====Section====
While multiview relates to external surfaces of an object, section views show an imaginary plane cut through an object. This is often useful to show voids in an object.

====Auxiliary====
Auxiliary views utilize an additional projection plane other than the common planes in a multiview. Since the features of an object need to show the true shape and size of the object, the projection plane must be parallel to the object surface. Therefore, any surface that is not in line with the three major axis needs its own projection plane to show the features correctly.

====Pattern====
Patterns, sometimes called developments, show the size and shape of a flat piece of material needed for later bending or folding into a three-dimensional shape.

====Exploded====

An &quot;exploded-view drawing&quot; is a technical drawing of an object that shows the relationship or order of assembly of the various parts. It shows the components of an object slightly separated by distance or suspended in surrounding space in the case of a three-dimensional exploded diagram. An object is represented as if there had been a small controlled explosion emanating from the middle of the object, causing the object&#x27;s parts to be separated relative distances away from their original locations.

An exploded view drawing (EVD) can show the intended assembly of mechanical or other parts. In mechanical systems, the component closest to the center is usually assembled first or is the main part inside which the other parts are assembled. The EVD can also help to represent the disassembly of parts, where those on the outside are normally removed first.

===Standards and conventions===

====Basic drafting paper sizes====
There have been many standard sizes of paper at different times and in different countries, but today most of the world uses the international standard (A4 and its siblings). North America uses its own sizes.

===Patent drawing===

The applicant for a patent will be required by law to furnish a drawing of the invention if or when the nature of the case requires a drawing to understand the invention with the job. This drawing must be filed with the application. This includes practically all inventions except s of matter or processes, but a drawing may also be useful in the case of many processes.

The drawing must show every feature of the invention specified in the claims and is required by the patent office rules to be in a particular form. The Office specifies the size of the sheet on which the drawing is made, the type of paper, the margins, and other details relating to the making of the drawing. The reason for specifying the standards in detail is that the drawings are printed and published in a uniform style when the patent issues and the drawings must also be such that they can be readily understood by people using the patent descriptions.

===Sets of technical drawings===

====Working drawings for production====
Working drawings are the set of technical drawings used during the manufacturing phase of a product. In architecture, these include civil drawings, architectural drawings, structural drawings, mechanical systems drawings, electrical drawings, and plumbing drawings.

====Assembly drawings====
Assembly drawings show how different parts go together, identify those parts by number, and have a parts list, often referred to as a bill of materials. In a technical service manual, this type of drawing may be referred to as an exploded view drawing or diagram.
These parts may be used in engineering.

====As-fitted drawings====
Also called &quot;As-Built drawings&quot; or &quot;As-made drawings&quot;. As-fitted drawings represent a record of the completed works, literally &#x27;as fitted&#x27;. These are based upon the &quot;working drawings&quot; and updated to reflect any changes or alterations undertaken during construction or manufacture.

<text>Anicius Olybrius (died 2 November 472) was Roman emperor from July 472 until his death later that same year; his rule as &quot;augustus&quot; in the western Roman Empire was not recognised as legitimate by the ruling &quot;augustus&quot; in the eastern Roman Empire, Leo I (). He was in reality a puppet ruler raised to power by Ricimer, the &quot;magister militum&quot; of Germanic descent, and was mainly interested in religion, while the actual power was held by Ricimer and his nephew Gundobad.

==Biography==
===Family and early career===
Olybrius was born in Rome, in the ancient and powerful &quot;gens&quot; Anicia, of Italian descent.

According to the consensus of historians, he was related to the consul Anicius Hermogenianus Olybrius, whose wife and cousin, Anicia Juliana, had the same name that Olybrius gave to his own daughter. Other historians consider this questionable, as &quot;Juliana&quot; was a common name in the &quot;gens&quot; Anicia, and because Hermogenianus seems to have begotten only one daughter, who took chastity vows. Other possible fathers have therefore been proposed: either Anicius Probus (suggested by Settipani) or, according to some clues, Petronius Maximus.

Olybrius married Placidia, younger daughter of western &quot;augustus&quot; Valentinian III () and his wife Licinia Eudoxia, thus creating a bond between a member of the senatorial aristocracy and the conjoined Valentinianic–Theodosian dynasties. The year of their wedding is not recorded, although the historian Priscus implies it took place before the Vandals under Gaiseric&#x27;s sack of Rome (June 2–16, 455). Oost has pointed out that in his chronicle Hydatius wrote Placidia was unmarried as of 455.

Steven Muhlberger points out that many of the events in the chronicle of Hydatius are based on hearsay, that problems with his chronology &quot;resulted from delays and distortions in the best information to which he had access,&quot; and thus the evidence from Hydatius is not as decisive as Oost believed. Regardless, the powerful &quot;magister militum&quot; Aetius had forced Valentinian to betroth Placidia to his own son Gaudentius, so Olybrius could not have married her before Aetius&#x27; death.

Aetius&#x27; death came 21 September 454, when the Emperor Valentinian provoked a quarrel with him that ended with the Emperor killing Aetius with his own sword. The following year, Valentinian was killed by some soldiers who had served under Aetius, probably instigated by the &quot;patricius&quot; Petronius Maximus, who succeeded to the throne. Petronius, who was a high-ranking imperial officer and a member of a family belonging to the senatorial aristocracy, married the &quot;augusta&quot; Licinia Eudoxia, widow of Valentinian. He also elevated his own son Palladius to the rank of &quot;caesar&quot; and had him marry Eudocia, elder daughter of Valentinian.

According to those historians who believe that Olybrius was Petronius&#x27; son, it was in 455 that Olybrius married Placidia, between 17 April, when Petronius was acclaimed &quot;augustus&quot;, and 31 May, when he died; this would explain the marriage between Olybrius and Valentinian&#x27;s younger daughter as a move to secure Petronius&#x27; legitimacy as emperor.

Another possibility is that Olybrius and Placidia were engaged in 455, and only after Gaiseric freed her from his possession in the early 460s were they at last married. Oost mentions this possibility in his book &quot;Galla Placidia Augusta&quot;. The surviving evidence is not sufficient to allow us to decide between these alternatives.

===Twice candidate for the throne===
The Vandals, led by King Gaiseric, took advantage of the confusion and weakness of the Western Empire in the wake of Valentinian&#x27;s turbulent succession, moving into Italy and sacking Rome in June 455. Before returning to Africa, the Vandals took Licinia Eudoxia and her two daughters as hostages. According to the 6th-century historian John Malalas, Olybrius was in Constantinople at the time. On the other hand, the 6th-century chronicler Evagrius Scholasticus writes that Olybrius had fled Rome on the approach of Gaiseric&#x27;s army.

During his residence in the Eastern capital, Olybrius expressed his interest in religious matters. He met Daniel the Stylite, who, according to Christian tradition, prophesied the liberation of Licinia Eudoxia. In the meantime, the Western Empire went through a rapid succession of Emperors. After Petronius, the Gallic-Roman senator Avitus was proclaimed Emperor by the Visigoth king Theodoric II and ruled for two years; he was deposed by Majorian, who ruled for four years before being killed by his general Ricimer in 461.

Gaiseric supported Olybrius to assume the vacant Western throne because Gaiseric&#x27;s son Huneric and Olybrius had married the two daughters of Valentinian III, and with Olybrius on the throne, Gaiseric could exert great influence on the Western Empire. Therefore, Gaiseric freed Licinia Eudoxia (fulfilling Daniel&#x27;s prophesy) and her daughter Placidia (Olybrius&#x27; wife), but he did not cease his raids on Italy&#x27;s coasts. His project failed, however, as Ricimer, who had become the &quot;Magister militum&quot; of the West, chose Libius Severus as new Emperor (461–465). Placidia was now free, however, joining her husband at Constantinople, where they had a daughter, Anicia Juliana, in 462.

Olybrius was nearly chosen for the Western throne again in 465, after Libius Severus died. Gaiseric was again his major supporter, but the Eastern Emperor Leo I chose the noble Procopius Anthemius. Olybrius&#x27; association with Gaiseric did not harm his career, however, as the Eastern court chose him for the high honour of the consulate in 464.
===Rise to the throne===
Sources agree that Olybrius rose to the western throne thanks to the western &quot;magister militum&quot; Ricimer. They differ over the timing and order of the events leading to his ascent.

In the version provided by John Malalas, and championed by J. B. Bury, Olybrius was sent to Italy in 472 by Leo I, ostensibly to mediate between Ricimer and Anthemius, who was besieged by Ricimer in Rome. Once he had accomplished this, Olybrius would then continue to Carthage and offer a peace treaty to Gaiseric. Leo suspected that Olybrius favored the Vandal king, however, and would secretly take his side and betray the suspicious Emperor. Leo had Olybrius followed by another envoy bearing a letter for Anthemius stating:
: I have removed Aspar and Ardaburius from this world, so that no one who might oppose me would survive. But you also must kill your son-in-law Ricimer, lest there be anyone who might betray you. Moreover, I also have sent the patrician Olybrius to you; I wish you to kill him, so that you might reign, ruling rather than serving others.

Ricimer had placed a guard at Ostia who found the secret letter. Ricimer showed the document to Olybrius, which convinced Olybrius to accept the purple. From Ricimer&#x27;s point of view, Olybrius was a good candidate, as a member of the Roman senatorial aristocracy and because of his marriage to Placidia; his marriage to her makes him the last emperor of the conjoined Valentinianic–Theodosian dynasties to rule in the west. Ricimer had Anthemius killed and Olybrius acclaimed Emperor (11 July 472).

The competing version of events does not mention the secret letter. Instead, after arriving in Rome, Olybrius was proclaimed emperor several months before Anthemius&#x27; death, in April or May 472. Ricimer then besieged the part of Rome where Anthemius was for several months until the lawful Emperor was abandoned by his partisans, captured in a church, and put to death by Gundobad, Ricimer&#x27;s nephew. This version implies that Olybrius was secretly supported by the Emperor Leo, which explains why Leo sent him there. Three sources – Theophanes, the &quot;Paschal Chronicle&quot;, and Paullus Diaconus – support this version. Edward Gibbon accepts this implication as fact, although none of the three sources explicitly state that Leo supported Olybrius. What other reason could there be, Bury asks, then answers his own rhetorical question: &quot;the facts that Anthemius was Leo&#x27;s chosen candidate, his &quot;filius&quot;, and that Olybrius was the friend of his foe Genseric, are a strong counter-argument.&quot;

===Reign and death===

The reign of Olybrius was short and uneventful. Soon after the death of Anthemius, Ricimer also died, on 9 or 19 August; his nephew Gundobad was elevated to &quot;magister militum&quot; in his place. Very little is known of Olybrius&#x27; policy; in his &quot;Vita Epifanius&quot;, Ennodius describes him as a pious man who acted accordingly. As evidence, he had minted a new series of gold coins bearing a cross and the new legend (&quot;Welfare of the World&quot;) instead of the usual (&quot;Welfare of the State&quot;). It is also noteworthy that Olybrius is depicted on his coins without helm and spear, common symbols on his predecessors&#x27; coinage, suggesting he had little interest in military matters.

Olybrius had a palace in the Tenth region of Constantinople at one end of the Mese, the main street, along the &quot;Constantinianae&quot;. Olybrius also restored, at his own expense, the nearby church of Saint Euphemia in Chalcedon, a famous church that had been chosen by the &quot;augusta&quot; Pulcheria (), sister of Theodosius II (), for the Council of Chalcedon in 451. This choice was a sign of the bond between Olybrius, a Roman senator, with the imperial Theodosian dynasty.

Olybrius died of dropsy after only seven months of rule, most likely on 2 November.

==Olybrius in culture==
In 1707, Apostolo Zeno and Pietro Pariati wrote a &quot;libretto&quot; entitled &quot;Flavio Anicio Olibrio&quot;. The story told in the opera is quite different from the real one, despite the fact that Zeno claimed to use several historical sources (Evagrius Scholasticus l.2.c.7, Procopius of Caesarea, &quot;Historia Vandalorum&quot;, l.1, Paul the Deacon, vi): Ricimer captures Rome, frees his sister Teodolinda and enslaves Placidia, daughter of Valentinian III; a little later, Olybrius frees Rome and Placidia, and marries her.

The &quot;libretto&quot; was written for a &quot;dramma per musica&quot; in three acts by Francesco Gasparini, performed that same year in the Teatro San Cassiano in Venice, but the same &quot;libretto&quot; was put to music also by Nicola Porpora (1711, in Naples, as &quot;Il trionfo di Flavio Anicio Olibrio&quot;),

<text>Radio drama (or audio drama, audio play, radio play, radio theatre, or audio theatre) is a dramatized, purely acoustic performance. With no visual component, radio drama depends on dialogue, music and sound effects to help the listener imagine the characters and story: &quot;It is auditory in the physical dimension but equally powerful as a visual force in the psychological dimension.&quot; Radio drama includes plays specifically written for radio, docudrama, dramatized works of fiction, as well as plays originally written for the theatre, including musical theatre, and opera.

Radio drama achieved widespread popularity within a decade of its initial development in the 1920s. By the 1940s, it was a leading international popular entertainment. With the advent of television in the 1950s, radio drama began losing its audience. However, it remains popular in much of the world.

Recordings of OTR (old-time radio) survive today in the audio archives of collectors, libraries and museums, as well as several online sites such as the Internet Archive.

By the 21st century, radio drama had a minimal presence on terrestrial radio in the United States, with much American radio drama being restricted to rebroadcasts of programmes from previous decades. However, other nations still have thriving traditions of radio drama. In the United Kingdom, for example, the BBC produces and broadcasts hundreds of new radio plays each year on Radio 3, Radio 4, and Radio 4 Extra. Like the US, Australia&#x27;s network the ABC has abandoned broadcasting drama but in New Zealand on RNZ, continues to promote and broadcast a variety of drama over its airwaves.

Thanks to advances in digital recording and Internet distribution, radio drama experienced a revival around 2010. Podcasting offered the means of inexpensively creating new radio dramas, in addition to the distribution of vintage programs.

The terms &quot;audio drama&quot; or &quot;audio theatre&quot; are sometimes used synonymously with &quot;radio drama&quot;; however, audio drama or audio theatre may not necessarily be intended specifically for broadcast on radio. Audio drama can also be found on CDs, cassette tapes, podcasts, webcasts, or other digital downloads as well as broadcast radio.

== History ==
The Roman playwright Seneca has claim as a forerunner of radio drama because &quot;his plays were performed by readers as sound plays, not by actors as stage plays... In this respect Seneca had no significant successors until 20th-century technology made possible the widespread dissemination of sound plays.&quot;

=== 1880–1930: early years ===
Radio drama traces its roots back to the 1880s: &quot;In 1881 French engineer Clement Ader had filed a patent for &#x27;improvements of Telephone Equipment in Theatres (Théâtrophone). English-language radio drama seems to have started in the United States. &quot;A Rural Line on Education&quot;, a brief sketch specifically written for radio, aired on Pittsburgh&#x27;s KDKA in 1921, according to historian Bill Jaker. Newspaper accounts of the era report on a number of other drama experiments by America&#x27;s commercial radio stations: KYW broadcast a season of complete operas from Chicago starting in November 1921. In February 1922, entire Broadway musical comedies with the original casts aired from WJZ&#x27;s Newark studios. Actors Grace George and Herbert Hayes performed an entire play from a San Francisco station in the summer of 1922.

An important turning point in radio drama came when Schenectady, New York&#x27;s WGY, after a successful tryout on August 3, 1922, began weekly studio broadcasts of full-length stage plays in September 1922, using music, sound effects and a regular troupe of actors, The WGY Players. Aware of this series, the director of Cincinnati&#x27;s WLW began regularly broadcasting one-acts (as well as excerpts from longer works) in November. The success of these projects led to imitators at other stations. By early 1923, original dramatic pieces written specially for radio were airing on stations in Cincinnati (&quot;When Love Wakens&quot; by WLW&#x27;s Fred Smith), Philadelphia (&quot;The Secret Wave&quot; by Clyde A. Criswell) and Los Angeles (&quot;At Home&quot; over KHJ). That same year, WLW (in May) and WGY (in September) sponsored scripting contests, inviting listeners to create original plays to be performed by those stations&#x27; dramatic troupes.

Listings in &quot;The New York Times&quot; and other sources for May 1923 reveal at least 20 dramatic offerings were scheduled (including one-acts, excerpts from longer dramas, complete three- and four-act plays, operettas and a Molière adaptation), either as in-studio productions or by remote broadcast from local theaters and opera houses. An early British drama broadcast was of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; on 2LO on 25 July 1923.

Serious study of American radio drama of the 1920s and early 1930s is, at best, very limited. Unsung pioneers of the art include: WLW&#x27;s Fred Smith; Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll (who popularized the dramatic serial); &quot;The Eveready Hour&quot; creative team (which began with one-act plays but was soon experimenting with hour-long combinations of drama and music on its weekly variety program); the various acting troupes at stations like WLW, WGY, KGO and a number of others, frequently run by women like Helen Schuster Martin and Wilda Wilson Church; early network continuity writers like Henry Fisk Carlton, William Ford Manley and Don Clark; producers and directors like Clarence Menser and Gerald Stopp; and a long list of others who were credited at the time with any number of innovations but who are largely forgotten or undiscussed today. Elizabeth McLeod&#x27;s 2005 book on Gosden and Correll&#x27;s early work is a major exception, as is Richard J. Hand&#x27;s 2006 study of horror radio, which examines some programs from the late 1920s and early 1930s.

Another notable early radio drama, one of the first specially written for the medium in the UK, was &quot;A Comedy of Danger&quot; by Richard Hughes, broadcast by the BBC on January 15, 1924, about a group of people trapped in a Welsh coal mine. One of the earliest and most influential French radio plays was the prize-winning &quot;Marémoto&quot; (&#x27;Seaquake&#x27;), by Gabriel Germinet and Pierre Cusy, which presents a realistic account of a sinking ship before revealing that the characters are actually actors rehearsing for a broadcast. Translated and broadcast in Germany and England by 1925, the play was originally scheduled by Radio-Paris to air on October 23, 1924, but was instead banned from French radio until 1937 because the government feared that the dramatic SOS messages would be mistaken for genuine distress signals.

In 1951, American writer and producer Arch Oboler suggested that Wyllis Cooper&#x27;s &quot;Lights Out&quot; (1934–47) was the first true radio drama to make use of the unique qualities of radio:
Though the series is often remembered solely for its gruesome stories and sound effects, Cooper&#x27;s scripts for &quot;Lights Out&quot; were later recognized as well written and offered innovations seldom heard in early radio dramas, including multiple first-person narrators, stream of consciousness monologues and scripts that contrasted a duplicitous character&#x27;s internal monologue and his spoken words.

The question of who was the first to write stream-of-consciousness drama for radio is a difficult one to answer. By 1930, Tyrone Guthrie had written plays for the BBC like &quot;Matrimonial News&quot; (which consists entirely of the thoughts of a shopgirl awaiting a blind date) and &quot;The Flowers Are Not for You to Pick&quot; (which takes place inside the mind of a drowning man). After they were published in 1931, Guthrie&#x27;s plays aired on the American networks. Around the same time, Guthrie himself also worked for the Canadian National Railway radio network, producing plays written by Merrill Denison that used similar techniques. A 1940 article in &quot;Variety&quot; credited a 1932 NBC play, &quot;Drink Deep&quot; by Don Johnson, as the first stream-of-consciousness play written for American radio. The climax of Lawrence Holcomb&#x27;s 1931 NBC play &quot;Skyscraper&quot; also uses a variation of the technique (so that the listener can hear the final thoughts and relived memories of a man falling to his death from the title building).

There were probably earlier examples of stream-of-consciousness drama on the radio. For example, in December 1924, actor Paul Robeson, then appearing in a revival of Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;The Emperor Jones&quot;, performed a scene from the play over New York&#x27;s WGBS to critical acclaim. Some of the many storytellers and monologists on early 1920s American radio might be able to claim even earlier dates.

=== 1930–1960s: widespread popularity ===
Perhaps America&#x27;s most famous radio drama broadcast is Orson Welles&#x27; &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; (a 1938 version of H. G. Wells&#x27; novel), which inspired stories of a mass panic that, though greatly exaggerated, signaled the power of the form.
By the late 1930s, radio drama was widely popular in the United States (and also in other parts of the world). There were dozens of programs in many different genres, from mysteries and thrillers, to soap operas and comedies. Among American playwrights, screenwriters and novelists who got their start in radio drama are Rod Serling and Irwin Shaw.
In Britain, however, during the 1930s BBC programming, tended to be more high brow, including the works of Shakespeare, Classical Greek drama, as well as the works of major modern playwrights, such as Chekhov, Ibsen, Strindberg, and so forth. Novels and short stories were also frequently dramatised. In addition the plays of contemporary writers and original plays were produced, with, for example, a broadcast of T. S. Eliot&#x27;s famous verse play &quot;Murder in the Cathedral&quot; in 1936. By 1930, the BBC was producing &quot;twice as many plays as London&#x27;s West End&quot; and were producing over 400 plays a year by the mid-1940s.

Producers of radio drama soon became aware that adapting stage plays for radio did not always work, and that there was a need for plays specifically written for radio, which recognized its potential as a distinct and different medium from the theatre. George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s plays, for example, were seen as readily adaptable. However, in a lead article in the BBC literary journal &quot;The Listener&quot;, of 14 August 1929, which discussed the broadcasting of 12 great plays, it was suggested that while the theatrical literature of the past should not be neglected the future lay mainly with plays written specifically for the microphone.

In 1939–40, the BBC founded its own Drama Repertory Company which made a stock of actors readily available. After the war, the number was around 50. They performed in the great number of plays broadcast in the heyday of BBC radio drama of the 40s–60s.

Initially the BBC resisted American-style &#x27;soap opera&#x27;, but eventually highly popular serials, like &quot;Dick Barton, Special Agent&quot; (1946–51), &quot;Mrs Dale&#x27;s Diary&quot; (1948–69) and &quot;The Archers&quot; (1950–), were produced. &quot;The Archers&quot; is still running () and is the world&#x27;s longest-running soap opera with a total of over 18,400 episodes. There had been some earlier serialized drama including, the six episode &quot;The Shadow of the Swastika&quot; (1939), Dorothy L. Sayers&#x27;s &quot;The Man Born To Be King&quot;, in twelve episodes (1941), and &quot;Front Line Family&quot; (1941–48), which was broadcast to America as part of the effort to encourage the US to enter the war. The show&#x27;s storylines depicted the trials and tribulations of a British family, the Robinsons, living through the war. This featured plots about rationing, family members missing in action and the Blitz. After the war in 1946 it was moved to the BBC Light Programme.

The BBC continued producing various kinds of drama, including docu-drama, throughout World War II; amongst the writers they employed were the novelist James Hanley and poet Louis MacNeice, who in 1941 became an employee of the BBC&#x27;s. MacNeice&#x27;s work for the BBC initially involved writing and producing radio programmes intended to build support for the US, and later Russia, through cultural programmes emphasising links between the countries rather than outright propaganda. By the end of the war MacNeice had written well over 60 scripts for the BBC, including &quot;Christopher Columbus&quot; (1942), which starred Laurence Olivier, &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; (1946), and a six-part radio adaptation of Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot; (1949).

Following World War II the BBC reorganized its radio provision, introducing two new channels to supplement the BBC Home Service (itself the result of the fusion in September 1939 of the pre-war National and Regional Programmes). These were the BBC Light Programme (dating from 29 July 1945 and a direct successor to the wartime General Forces Programme) and the BBC Third Programme (launched on 29 September 1946).

The BBC Light Programme, while principally devoted to light entertainment and music, carried a fair share of drama, both single plays (generally, as the name of the station indicated, of a lighter nature) and serials. In contrast, the BBC Third Programme, destined to become one of the leading cultural and intellectual forces in post-war Britain, specialized in heavier drama (as well as the serious music, talks, and other features which made up its content): long-form productions of both classical and modern/experimental dramatic works sometimes occupied the major part of its output on any given evening. The Home Service, meanwhile, continued to broadcast more &quot;middle-brow&quot; drama (one-off plays and serializations) daily.

The high-water mark for BBC radio drama was the 1950s and 1960s, and during this period many major British playwrights either effectively began their careers with the BBC, or had works adapted for radio. Most of playwright Caryl Churchill&#x27;s early experiences with professional drama production were as a radio playwright and, starting in 1962 with &quot;The Ants&quot;, she wrote nine productions with BBC radio drama up until 1973, when her stage work began to be recognised at the Royal Court Theatre. Joe Orton&#x27;s dramatic debut in 1963 was the radio play &quot;The Ruffian on the Stair&quot;, which was broadcast on 31 August 1964.

Tom Stoppard&#x27;s &quot;first professional production was in the 15-minute &quot;Just Before Midnight&quot; programme on BBC Radio, which showcased new dramatists&quot;. John Mortimer made his radio debut as a dramatist in 1955, with his adaptation of his own novel &quot;Like Men Betrayed&quot; for the BBC Light Programme. However, he made his debut as an original playwright with &quot;The Dock Brief&quot;, starring Michael Hordern as a hapless barrister, first broadcast in 1957 on BBC Third Programme, later televised with the same cast and subsequently presented in a double bill with &quot;What Shall We Tell Caroline?&quot; at the Lyric Hammersmith in April 1958, before transferring to the Garrick Theatre. Mortimer is most famous for &quot;Rumpole of the Bailey&quot;, a British television series which starred Leo McKern as Horace Rumpole, an aging London barrister who defends any and all clients. It has been spun off into a series of short stories, novels, and radio programmes.

Giles Cooper was a pioneer in writing for radio, becoming prolific in both radio and television drama. His early successes included radio dramatisations of Charles Dickens&#x27;s &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, William Golding&#x27;s &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;, and John Wyndham&#x27;s classic science fiction novel &quot;Day of the Triffids&quot;. He was also successful in the theatre. The first of his radio plays to make his reputation was &quot;Mathry Beacon&quot; (1956), about a small detachment of men and women still guarding a Top Secret &quot;missile deflector&quot; somewhere in Wales, years after the war has ended. Bill Naughton&#x27;s radio play &quot;Alfie Elkins and his Little Life&quot; (1962) was first broadcast on the BBC Third Programme on 7 January 1962. In it Alfie, &quot;[w]ith sublime amorality... swaggers and philosophises his way through&quot; life. The action spans about two decades, from the beginning of World War II to the late 1950s. In 1964, Bill Naughton turned it into a stage play which was put on at London&#x27;s Mermaid Theatre. Later, he wrote the screenplay for a film version, &quot;Alfie&quot; (1966), starring Michael Caine.

Other notable radio dramatists included Henry Reed, Brendan Behan, Rhys Adrian, Alan Plater; Anthony Minghella, Alan Bleasdale, and novelist Angela Carter. Novelist Susan Hill also wrote for BBC Radio, from the early 1970s. Henry Reed was especially successful with the Hilda Tablet plays. Irish playwright Brendan Behan, author of &quot;The Quare Fellow&quot; (1954), was commissioned by the BBC to write a radio play &quot;The Big House&quot; (1956); prior to this he had written two plays for Irish radio: &quot;Moving Out&quot; and &quot;A Garden Party&quot;.

Among the most famous works created for radio, are Dylan Thomas&#x27;s &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot; (1954), Samuel Beckett&#x27;s &quot;All That Fall&quot; (1957), Harold Pinter&#x27;s &quot;A Slight Ache&quot; (1959), and Robert Bolt&#x27;s &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot; (1954). Beckett wrote a number of short radio plays in the 1950s and 1960s, and later for television; his radio play &quot;Embers&quot; was first broadcast on the BBC Third Programme on 24 June 1959 and won the RAI prize at the Prix Italia awards later that year.

Robert Bolt&#x27;s writing career began with scripts for &quot;Children&#x27;s Hour&quot;. &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot; was subsequently produced on television in 1957. Then in 1960, there was a highly successful stage production in London&#x27;s West End and on New York&#x27;s Broadway from late 1961. In addition there have been two film versions: in 1966 starring Paul Scofield and 1988 for television, starring Charlton Heston.

While Alan Ayckbourn did not write for radio many of his stage plays were subsequently adapted for radio. Other significant adaptations included, dramatised readings of poet David Jones&#x27;s &quot;In Parenthesis&quot; in 1946 and &quot;The Anathemata&quot; in 1953, for the BBC Third Programme, and novelist Wyndham Lewis&#x27;s &quot;The Human Age&quot; (1955). Among contemporary novels that were dramatised were the 1964 radio adaptation of Stan Barstow&#x27;s &quot;A Kind of Loving&quot; (1960); there had also been a 1962 film adaption.

=== 1960–2000: decline in the United States ===
After the advent of television, radio drama never recovered its popularity in the United States. Most remaining CBS and NBC radio dramas were cancelled in 1960. The last network radio dramas to originate during American radio&#x27;s &quot;Golden Age&quot;, &quot;Suspense&quot; and &quot;Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar&quot;, ended on September 30, 1962.

There have been some efforts at radio drama since then. In the 1960s, Dick Orkin created the popular syndicated comic adventure series &quot;Chicken Man&quot;. ABC Radio aired a daily dramatic anthology program, &quot;Theater Five&quot;, in 1964–65. Inspired by &quot;The Goon Show&quot;, &quot;the four or five crazy guys&quot; of the Firesign Theatre built a large following with their satirical plays on recordings exploring the dramatic possibilities inherent in stereo. A brief resurgence of production beginning in the early 1970s yielded Rod Serling&#x27;s &quot;The Zero Hour&quot; for Mutual, National Public Radio&#x27;s &quot;Earplay&quot;, and veteran Himan Brown&#x27;s &quot;CBS Radio Mystery Theater&quot; and &quot;General Mills Radio Adventure Theater&quot;. These productions were later followed by the &quot;Sears/Mutual Radio Theater&quot;, &quot;The National Radio Theater of Chicago&quot;, &quot;NPR Playhouse&quot;, and a newly produced episode of the former 1950s series &quot;X Minus One&quot;. Works by a new generation of dramatists also emerged at this time, notably Yuri Rasovsky, Thomas Lopez of ZBS and the dramatic sketches heard on humorist Garrison Keillor&#x27;s &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot;. Brian Daley&#x27;s 1981 adaptation of the blockbuster space opera film &quot;Star Wars&quot; for &quot;NPR Playhouse&quot; was a notable success. Production costs on this serial were mitigated by the support of Lucasfilm, which sold the rights to NPR for a nominal $1 fee, and by the participation of the BBC in an international co-production deal. &quot;Star Wars&quot; was credited with generating a 40% rise in NPR&#x27;s ratings and quadrupling the network&#x27;s youth audience overnight. Radio adaptations of the sequels followed with &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; in 1983 and &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; in 1996.

Thanks in large part to the National Endowments for the Arts and Humanities, public radio continued to air a smattering of audio drama until the mid-1980s. From 1986 to 2002, NPR&#x27;s most consistent producer of radio drama was the idiosyncratic Joe Frank, working out of KCRW in Santa Monica. The Sci Fi Channel presented an audio drama series, &quot;Seeing Ear Theatre&quot;, on its website from 1997 to 2001. Also, the dramatic serial &quot;It&#x27;s Your World&quot; aired twice daily on the nationally syndicated &quot;Tom Joyner Morning Show&quot; from 1994 to 2008, continuing online through 2010.

=== 2000–present: radio drama&#x27;s &quot;new media&quot; revival ===
Radio drama remains popular in much of the world, though most material is now available through Internet download rather than heard over terrestrial or satellite radio. Stations producing radio drama often commission a large number of scripts. The relatively low cost of producing a radio play enables them to take chances with works by unknown writers. Radio can be a good training ground for beginning drama writers as the words written form a much greater part of the finished product; bad lines cannot be obscured with stagecraft.

The BBC&#x27;s sole surviving radio soap is &quot;The Archers&quot; on BBC Radio 4: it is, with over 18,700 episodes to date, the world&#x27;s longest-running such programme. Other radio soaps (&quot;ongoing serials&quot;) produced by the BBC but no longer on air include:
* &quot;Mrs Dale&#x27;s Diary&quot; (1948–69)
* &quot;Westway&quot; on the World Service (1997–2005)
* &quot;Silver Street&quot; (2004–10) on the Asian Network

In September, 2010 Radio New Zealand began airing its first ongoing soap opera, &quot;You Me Now&quot;, which won the Best New Drama Award in the 2011 New Zealand Radio Awards.

On KDVS radio in Davis, California there are two radio theater shows, &quot;Evening Shadows&quot;, a horror/fantasy show paying tribute to classic old-time radio horror, and &quot;KDVS Radio Theater&quot; which commonly features dramas about social and political themes.

The audio drama format exists side by side with books presented on radio, read by actors or by the author. In Britain and other countries there is also quite a bit of radio comedy (both stand-up and sitcom). Together, these programs provide entertainment where television is either not wanted or would be distracting (such as while driving or operating machinery). &quot;Selected Shorts&quot;, a long-running NPR program broadcast in front of a live audience at Symphony Space in New York, originated the &quot;driveway moment&quot; for over 300,000 people listeners each week during readings of contemporary and classic short stories by well-known professional actors.

The lack of visuals also enable fantastical settings and effects to be used in radio plays where the cost would be prohibitive for movies or television. &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; was first produced as radio drama, and was not adapted for television until much later, when its popularity would ensure an appropriate return for the high cost of the futuristic setting.

On occasion television series can be revived as radio series. For example, a long-running but no longer popular television series can be continued as a radio series because the reduced production costs make it cost-effective with a much smaller audience. When an organization owns both television and radio channels, such as the BBC, the fact that no royalties have to be paid makes this even more attractive. Radio revivals can also use actors reprising their television roles even after decades as they still sound roughly the same. Series that have had this treatment include &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;, &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; and &quot;The Tomorrow People&quot;. In 2013 BBC Radio 4 released a radio adaptation of &quot;Neverwhere&quot; by Neil Gaiman, featuring a cast of well known television and film actors. Neil Gaiman has said he was excited about the radio drama adaptation as it allowed the work to be presented with a greater deal of special effects than was possible on television. In the United States, an adaptation of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; aired to modest success in the 2000s (decade) as a syndicated program.

Regular broadcasts of radio drama in English can be heard on the BBC&#x27;s Radio 3, Radio 4 and Radio 4 Extra (formerly Radio 7), on RTÉ Radio 1 in Ireland, and RNZ National in New Zealand. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation produced notable radio plays in Calgary and Toronto in the postwar decades, from which many actors and directors proceeded to international careers, but abolished its radio drama department in the 1970s and finally ceased production of radio dramas in 2012. BBC Radio 4 in today noted for its radio drama, broadcasting hundreds of new, one-off plays each year in such strands as &quot;The Afternoon Play&quot;, as well as serials and soap operas. Radio 4 Extra broadcasts a variety of radio plays from the BBC&#x27;s vast archives and a few extended versions of Radio 4 programmes. The British commercial station Oneword, though broadcasting mostly book readings, also transmitted a number of radio plays in instalments before it closed in 2008.

In the United States, contemporary radio drama can be found on broadcasters including ACB radio, produced by the American Council of the Blind; on the Sirius XM Book Radio channel from Sirius XM Satellite Radio (previously Sonic Theater on XM); and occasionally in syndication, as with Jim French&#x27;s production &quot;Imagination Theater&quot;. Several community radio stations carry weekly radio drama programs including KBOO, KFAI, WMPG, WLPP and WFHB.

A growing number of religious radio stations air daily or weekly programs usually geared to younger audiences, such as Focus on the Family&#x27;s &quot;Adventures in Odyssey&quot; (1,700+ syndicated stations), or Pacific Garden Mission&#x27;s &quot;Unshackled!&quot; (1,800 syndicated stations – a long-running radio drama), which is geared to adults. The networks sometime sell transcripts of their shows on cassette tapes or CDs or make the shows available for listening or downloading over the Internet. Transcription recordings of many pre-television shows have been preserved. They are collected, re-recorded onto audio CDs and/or MP3 files and traded by hobbyists today as old-time radio programs. Meanwhile, veterans such as the late Yuri Rasovsky (The National Radio Theater of Chicago) and Thomas Lopez (ZBS Foundation) have gained new listeners on cassettes, CDs and downloads. In the mid-1980s, the nonprofit L.A. Theatre Works launched its radio series recorded before live audiences. Productions have been broadcast via public radio, while also being marketed on compact discs and via download. Carl Amari&#x27;s nationally syndicated radio series &quot;Hollywood 360&quot; features four old-time radio shows during his four-hour weekly broadcasts. Amari also broadcasts old-time radio shows on &quot;The WGN Radio Theatre&quot; heard every Saturday night beginning at 10 pm on 720-WGN in Chicago.

In addition to traditional radio broadcasters, modern radio drama (also known as audio theater, or audio drama), has experienced a revival, with a growing number of independent producers who are able to build an audience through Internet distribution. While there are few academic programs in the United States that offer training in radio drama production, organizations such as the National Audio Theatre Festival teach the craft to new producers.

The digital age has also resulted in recording styles that differ from the studio recordings of radio drama&#x27;s Golden Age. &quot;Not from Space&quot; (2003) on XM Satellite Radio was the first national radio play recorded exclusively through the Internet in which the voice actors were all in separate locations. Other producers use portable recording equipment to record actors on location rather than in studios.

Podcasts are a growing distribution format for independent radio drama producers. Podcasts provides an alternative to mainstream television and radio which does not necessarily require a pitching process to be made and distributed (as these aspects of production can be learned by the creator) and which have no restrictions regarding programme length or content.

== Radio drama around the world ==

===Australia===
In Australia, as in most other developed countries, from the early years of the medium almost every radio network and station featured drama, serials, and soap operas as staples of their programming; during the so-called &quot;Golden Years&quot; of radio these were hugely popular. Many Australian serials and &quot;soapies&quot; were copies of American originals (e.g., the popular soap &quot;Portia Faces Life&quot; or the adventure series &quot;Superman&quot;, which featured future Australian TV star Leonard Teale in the title role), although these were typically locally produced and performed live to air, since the technology of the time did not permit high-quality pre-recording or duplication of programs for import or export.

In this period radio drama, serials and soap operas provided a fertile training ground and a steady source of employment for many actors, and this was particularly important because at this time the Australian theatre scene was in its infancy and opportunities were very limited. Many who trained in this medium (such as Peter Finch) subsequently became prominent both in Australia and overseas.

It has been noted that the producers of the popular 1960s Gerry Anderson TV series &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; were greatly impressed by the versatility of UK-based Australian actor Ray Barrett, who voiced many roles in Anderson&#x27;s TV productions. Thanks to his early experience on Australian live radio (where he often played English and American roles), Barrett was considered better than his English counterparts at providing a convincing transatlantic accent, and he could perform a wide range of character voices; he also impressed the Anderson team with his ability to quickly and easily switch from one voice/accent to another without the sound engineers&#x27; having to stop the recording.

The effect of the introduction of television there in the late 1950s had the same devastating effects as it did in the US and many other markets, and by the early 1960s Australian commercial radio had totally abandoned radio drama and related programming (including comedy, soapies, and variety) in favour of music-based formats (such as Top 40) or talk radio (&quot;talkback&quot;), and the once-flourishing Australia radio production industry vanished within a few years. One of the few companies to survive was the Melbourne-based Crawford Productions, which was able to make the successful transition into TV production.

Despite the complete abandonment of drama and related programming by the commercial radio sector, the government-funded Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) maintained a long history of producing radio drama. One of its most famous and popular series was the daily 15-minute afternoon soap opera &quot;Blue Hills&quot;, which was written for its entire production history by dramatist Gwen Meredith. It featured many well-known Australian actresses and actors, ran continuously for 27 years, from 28 February 1949 to 30 September 1976, with a total of 5,795 episodes broadcast, and was at one time the world&#x27;s longest-running radio serial. It was preceded by an earlier Meredith serial &quot;The Lawsons&quot;, which featured many of the same themes and characters and itself ran for 1299 episodes.

In the 1960s and later, the ABC continued to produce many original Australian radio dramas as well as works adapted from other media. In recent years original radio dramas and adapted works were commissioned from local dramatists and produced for the ABC&#x27;s Radio National network program &quot;Airplay&quot;, which ran from the late 1990s until early 2013. In late 2012 ABC management imposed budget cuts and axed a number of long-running arts programs, thereby ending the national broadcaster&#x27;s decades-long history of producing radio drama (as well as its equally long history of providing daily serialised book readings).

=== Cyprus ===
Since around the early sixties the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation (RIK) features radio plays in the Cypriot Greek dialect. They are called Cypriot (radio drama) sketches and they are mainly about Cyprus&#x27;s rural life, traditions and customs, its history and its culture.
The works are written by established writers, but also from new writers through the Writing Contest of Cypriot Sketches issued annually by CyBC (RIK).

Currently, Cypriot sketches are broadcast every Sunday and have a mostly comedic character, satirising current events, they also include comedic song parodies. CyBC has also made other types of radio dramas, such as crime stories in the 2010s, which are available online.

=== Finland ===
In Finland radio dramas (in Finnish ) by the Finnish national broadcasting company Yleisradio have been popular since 1930s, and have always used well-known theatre or movie actors. The dramas include books converted to audio dramas, versions of popular theatre productions, pulp novels adapted for radio, or drama explicitly written as radio dramas. One of the most well known series was &quot;Suomisen perhe&quot; (the &quot;Family Suominen&quot;) about a middle-class family, it became so popular that later the originally written for radio drama was converted into a movie series. Popular radio drama from other countries, like the BBC radio drama The Men from the Ministry was translated as &quot;Knalli ja sateenvarjo&quot; (&quot;Bowler hat and umbrella&quot;) and became very popular. J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s The Hobbit was converted to multi-part radio drama.

=== Germany ===
The first German radio drama was produced in 1923. Because of the external circumstances in postwar Germany in which most of the theaters were destroyed, radio drama boomed. Between 1945 and 1960 there were more than 500 radio plays every year. The German word for radio drama or audio play is . Today Germany is a major market for radio plays worldwide. In particular, audio plays on CD are very popular. A popular audio play serial of Germany and of the world is &quot; (&quot;Three Investigators&quot;).

Berlin&#x27;s Prix Europa includes a Radio Fiction category.

=== India ===
Vividh Bharati, a service of All India Radio, has a long running Hindi radio-drama program: &quot;Hawa Mahal&quot;.

The Satyanweshi audio drama series created by actor Aneesh See Yay adapted twenty two Byomkesh Bakshi novels and eight original audio dramas in the Malayalam language.

=== Republic of Ireland ===
RTÉ Radio Drama is one of the oldest audio theatre departments in the radio world.

=== Japan ===
Radio dramas began in Japan in 1925, and enjoyed a great level of popularity after the hit of &quot;Tankou no Naka&quot;. This resulted in the NHK hiring famous writers to write radio drama scripts for 500 yen, which in 1930 was equivalent to 1 million yen in the present day.

Due to voice acting in Japan having its own distinct culture, audio dramas continue to be popular in Japan, where they are now primarily released on disc as &quot;drama CDs&quot; (). They are also referred to in Japanese as &quot;voice dramas&quot; (). Many such audio dramas are based on anime, manga, novels and video games, but there are also many that are completely original. Though most drama CDs are commercial products made by corporate entities, there has been a growing number of &quot;doujin&quot; audio dramas in recent years due to it being easier for hobbyists to obtain the equipment required to make recordings, and the Internet making distribution easier.

=== Norway ===
Radioteatret (Radio drama in Norway) has existed since 1926.

=== Poland ===
In Poland, radio dramas are sometimes called &quot;the theater of the imagination&quot; (). The first Polish radio drama, &quot;Warszawianka&quot; based on Stanisław Wyspiański&#x27;s play, was produced in 1925 while the first radio drama written for radio was produced in 1929. Polish Radio has been successfully producing radio dramas since then – between 1925 and September 1939, over 2,500 were made. In 1956, Polish Radio started broadcasting &quot;Matysiakowie&quot;, which is currently one of the longest-running radio plays in the world. Audio plays based on literature are also popular in Poland, this is how the sound adaptations of George R. R. Martin&#x27;s &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot;, Mario Puzo&#x27;s &quot;The Godfather&quot;, Ken Follett&#x27;s &quot;The Pillars of the Earth&quot; or Robert Kirkman&#x27;s &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; were created. Since 1988, the Polish Radio Theater has awarded the &quot;&quot; awards to actors and authors of radio dramas.

=== Romania ===
Radio theatre (Teatru Radiofonic ) has a long tradition in Romania. The first piece was played in 1929. The 7000+ piece repertoire includes radio adaptations of both Romanian and international books/plays across many genres interpreted by the greatest Romanian actors of the time.

=== South Africa ===
Radio broadcasting began in South Africa in 1924 and remained the dominant broadcast medium in the country until the late 1970s. Created by an act of Parliament in 1936, the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) aired radio dramas along with news and British content in Afrikaans and English. Radio drama became more prominent with the launch of Springbok Radio, an English and Afrikaans commercial station operated by SABC between May 1950 and December 1985.

The SABC launched Radio Bantu in 1960s, broadcasting first in isiZulu and soon followed by other African languages, intended to serve as the apartheid state&#x27;s propaganda channel. However, radio drama broadcast in African languages contributed to subverting the apartheid government by shaping culture and identity while challenging apartheid ideologies. Radio dramas were not subjected to the same level of apartheid editorial scrutiny, and therefore provided a forum for ideas without openly addressing politics. Radio drama evolved with changing socio-economic contexts. Female characters began to feature more prominently.

Radio drama continues to be a mainstay of South African radio. SABC&#x27;s drama studios in each of the country&#x27;s 9 provinces produce dramas for all 19 SABC radio stations. Recognizing radio&#x27;s reach, some private sector entities have also invested in radio drama, such as Standard Bank&#x27;s 5-minute Iketsetse Zenzele radio drama which aired for 8 years to raise awareness about financial literacy, fraud, and cybercrimes. Non-governmental organizations widely use radio drama as part of campaigns for health awareness and rights activism, such as the long-running Soul Buddyz series focused on adolescent health, Masiphephe Radio Drama addressing gender-based violence, and the Plague in the Time of King Kapital and Queen Corona focused on Covid-19 awareness.

=== Thailand ===
A low power radio station &quot;M.C.O.K. Radio 2&quot; (formally Pira FM) introduces a new programming block called &quot;M.C.O.K. Television&quot; – aims to replace the regular evening music programmes. The programming block is composed of British radio dramas and an Audio-Described version of British TV programmes such as &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, &quot;EastEnders&quot; and &quot;Horrible Histories&quot;.

Since 1 November 2021, Radio dramas were scrapped and replaced with more (Audio-Described) programmes – &quot;All At Sea&quot;, &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;, &quot;Mrs. Brown&#x27;s Boys&quot; and &quot;The Outlaw&quot;. The radio station broadcasts on 87.2 MHz every evening / late night. Due to the nature of low-power VHF propagation, the coverage is very limited, the radio station can be heard only in Lat Luang (Bangkok / Samut Prakan area).
It is the first radio station in Thailand to broadcast both English radio / TV programmes on FM.

=== Mainland China ===
Before 2010, radio dramas on mainland China were usually performed by organisations associated with the Chinese Communist Party, such as the Central Radio Drama Troupe (), which was founded in 1954. Their content was also deeply related to the historical events of the corresponding period and they largely served as propaganda. &quot;10,000 Pieces of Clipboards&quot; (), produced by the China National Radio in 1950 to commemorate the Feb 7 General Strike (), is considered to be the first radio drama after the CCP established the regime in mainland China. Similar radio dramas include The &quot;North Korean Zoya - Kim Yu Ji&quot; () and &quot;Thanks to Stalin&quot; ().

With the development of the Internet and the spread of Japanese ACG culture, ACG fans on mainland China began to independently produce radio dramas at around 2010. These radio dramas are usually not broadcast on radio stations, but uploaded to online audio platforms like MissEvan.

<text>Pantone LLC (stylized as PANTONE) is an American limited liability company headquartered in Carlstadt, New Jersey, and best known for its Pantone Matching System (PMS), a proprietary color order system used in a variety of industries, notably graphic design, fashion design, product design, printing, and manufacturing and supporting the management of color from design to production, in physical and digital formats, among coated and uncoated materials, cotton, polyester, nylon and plastics.

X-Rite, a supplier of color measurement instruments and software, purchased Pantone for US$180 million in October 2007, and was itself acquired by Danaher Corporation in 2012. At the end of September 2023, Danaher spun-off its Environmental and Applied Solutions segment as Veralto Corporation.

==History==
Pantone began in New Jersey in the 1950s as the commercial printing company of brothers Mervin and Jesse Levine, M &amp; J Levine Advertising. In 1956, its founders, both advertising executives, hired recent Hofstra University graduate Lawrence Herbert as a part-time employee. Herbert used his chemistry knowledge to systematize and simplify the company&#x27;s stock of pigments and production of colored inks; by 1962, Herbert was running the ink and printing division at a profit, while the commercial-display division was US$50,000 in debt; he subsequently purchased the company&#x27;s technological assets from the Levine Brothers for US$50,000 () and renamed them &quot;Pantone&quot;.

The company&#x27;s primary products include the Pantone Guides, which consist of a large number of small (approximately 6×2 inches or 15×5 cm) thin cardboard or plastic sheets, printed on one side with a series of related color swatches and then bound into a small &quot;fan deck&quot;. For instance, a particular &quot;page&quot; might contain several yellows of varying tints. 

The idea behind the PMS is to allow designers to &quot;color match&quot; specific colors when a design enters production stage, regardless of the equipment used to produce the color. This system has been widely adopted by graphic designers and reproduction and printing houses. Pantone recommends that PMS Color Guides be purchased annually, as their inks become yellowish over time. Color variance also occurs within editions based on the paper stock used (coated, matte or uncoated), while interedition color variance occurs when there are changes to the specific paper stock used.

=== Adobe dispute ===
In 2022, a dispute between Pantone and Adobe resulted in the removal of Pantone color coordinates from Photoshop and Adobe&#x27;s other design software, causing colors in graphic artists&#x27; digital documents to be replaced with black unless artists paid Pantone a separate $15 monthly subscription fee. Artists accused Pantone and Adobe of holding their work hostage.

==Pantone Color Matching System==

The Pantone Color Matching System is largely a standardized color reproduction system; as of 2019 it has 2161 colors. By standardizing the colors, different manufacturers in different locations can all refer to the Pantone system to make sure colors match without direct contact with one another.

One such use is standardizing colors in the CMYK process. The CMYK process is a method of printing color by using four inks—cyan, magenta, yellow, and black. A majority of the world&#x27;s printed material is produced using the CMYK process, and there is a special subset of Pantone colors that can be reproduced using CMYK. Those that are possible to simulate through the CMYK process are labeled as such within the company&#x27;s guides.

However, about 30% of the Pantone system&#x27;s 1114 spot colors (as of year 2000) cannot be simulated with CMYK but with 13 base pigments (14 including black) mixed in specified amounts, called base colors. Those 1114 colors included 387 colors with numbers 100 to 487 from 1975 and some lighter colors from 600 to 732 in 1991. The original four-digit colors introduced in 1987 were remapped into three digits.

The Pantone system also later allowed for many special colors to be produced, such as metallics, fluorescents (neons) and pastels. There are 56 fluorescents from 801 to 814 (first 7 here are base colors, so called Dayglo) and from 901 to 942. Packaging metallics (previously premium metallics) are placed from 10101 to 10454 (54 of those added later, 354 altogether, 2 base colors Silver 10077 and Rose Gold 10412), while normal metallics are placed from 871 to 877 (first 7 here are base colors) and from 8001 to 8965. Pastels are from 9140 to 9163 with base colors being 0131, 0331, 0521, 0631, 0821, 0921 and 0961. While most of the Pantone system colors are beyond the printed CMYK gamut, it was only in 2001 that Pantone began providing translations of their existing system with screen-based colors. Screen-based colors use the RGB color model—red, green, blue—system to create various colors. A lot of colors are outside sRGB. The (discontinued) Goe system has RGB, LAB, SPD values with each color and has 10 base colors while only 4 of those new: Bright Red, Pink, Medium Purple and Dark Blue. Other 6 were in the system before: Yellow 012, Orange 021, Rubine Red, Green, Process Blue and Black that in Goe were named Medium Yellow, Bright Orange, Strong Red, Bright Green, Medium Blue and Neutral Black. (PMS has 8 more basic base colors, some not monopigmented: Yellow 010, Red 032, Warm Red, Rhodamine Red, Purple, Violet, Reflex Blue, Blue 072.)

Pantone colors are described by their allocated number (typically referred to as, for example, &quot;PMS 130&quot;). PMS colors are almost always used in branding and have even found their way into government legislation and military standards (to describe the colors of flags and seals). In January 2003, the Scottish Parliament debated a petition (reference PE512) to refer to the blue in the Scottish flag as &quot;Pantone 300&quot;. Countries such as Canada and South Korea and organizations such as the FIA have also chosen to refer to specific Pantone colors to use when producing flags. US states including Texas have set legislated PMS colors of their flags.
==Pantone Goe System==
On September 5, 2007, Pantone introduced the Goe System. Goe consisted of 2058 new colors in a new matching and numbering system. In addition to the standard swatch books (now called the GoeGuide), the new system also included adhesive-backed GoeSticks, interactive software, tools, and an online community where users were able to share color swatches and information.

The Goe system was streamlined to use fewer base colors (ten, plus clear coating for reflections, only 4 base colors were new) and accommodate many technical challenges in reproducing colors on a press.

The Pantone Goe system was discontinued in November 2013, but 4 new base colors were added into PMS and some of new colors too, though those 4 base colors are harder to purchase.

==Other products==

In mid-2006 Pantone, partnering with Vermont-based Fine Paints of Europe, introduced a new line of interior and exterior paints. The color palette uses Pantone&#x27;s color research and trending and has more than 3,000 colors.

In November 2015, Pantone partnered with Redland London to create a collection of bags inspired from Pantone&#x27;s authority on color.

Pantone also produced Hexachrome, a patented six-color printing system. In addition to custom CMYK inks, Hexachrome added orange and green inks to expand the color gamut, for better color reproduction. It was therefore also known as a CMYKOG process. Hexachrome was discontinued by Pantone in 2008 when Adobe Systems stopped supporting their HexWare plugin software. In 2015 7-color printing system was developed, adding Violet in CMYKOGV, that can cover 90% of 1114 spot colors, while CMYK only about 60%. 1729 new colors were added, marked XGC (extended gamut coated), some colors do not have a number, like Process Blue XGC or Purple XGC. Base colors of OGV were new mono-pigment inks, pigments PO34, PG7 and PV23 were used respectively with 58°, 180° and 311° hue angles.

Pantone Color Manager allows for users of the Adobe Creative Suite and Creative Cloud as well as other software to import the most up to date information inclusive of L*a*b* numbers as well as CMYK and sRGB representations of all the various palettes (including chromatic adaptation under default D50 or D65 with 2 degree or 10 degree observer or even any ICC profile). L*a*b* numbers allow for the most accurate representation of color in a device-independent manner, but ideally X-rite InkFormulation is needed to emulate substrates and all 14 base colors of main Pantone system or 7 colors of CMYKOGV. Support is being phased out in favour of Pantone Connect plugin from Adobe Exchange of Creative Cloud. Adobe Illustrator removed five acb files (Adobe Color Books) of Pantone+ colors in 2023 when Pantone+ was deprecated by Pantone.

==Color of the Year==
Since 2000, the Pantone Color Institute has declared a particular color &quot;Color of the Year&quot;. Twice a year the company hosts, in a European capital, a secret meeting of representatives from various nations&#x27; color standards groups. After two days of presentations and debate, they choose a color for the following year; for example, the color for summer 2013 was chosen in London in the spring of 2012.

The selected color purportedly connects with the zeitgeist; for example, the press release declaring Honeysuckle the color of 2011 said &quot;In times of stress, we need something to lift our spirits. Honeysuckle is a captivating, stimulating color that gets the adrenaline going – perfect to ward off the blues.&quot; The results of the meeting are published in &quot;Pantone View&quot;, which fashion designers, florists, and many other consumer-oriented companies purchase to help guide their designs and planning for future products. In 2016 and 2021, Pantone chose two colors for Color of the Year.










In 2012, the color of the year, Tangerine Tango, was used to create a makeup line, in partnership with Sephora. The product line, named Sephora + Pantone Universe collection, features Tangerine Tango–embellished false lashes, nail lacquers, cream, glitters, and high-pigment lip glosses. 2013 Emerald color was reported to be out of sRGB gamut. Also new Very Peri color of 2022 is present in TCX (dyed cotton reference) and TPG (Textile Paper – &quot;Green&quot;) form, here TCX for sRGB hex values are mentioned.

The person behind Pantone&#x27;s Color of the Year, executive director of the Pantone Color Institute Leatrice Eiseman, explained in an interview how 2014&#x27;s Color of the Year, Radiant Orchid, was chosen:
Pantone has said that color &quot;has always been an integral part of how a culture expresses the attitudes and emotions of the times.&quot;

==Intellectual property==
Pantone asserts that their lists of color numbers and pigment values are the intellectual property of Pantone and free use of the list is not allowed. This is frequently held as a reason Pantone colors cannot be supported in open-source software and are not often found in low-cost proprietary software. Pantone has been accused of &quot;being intentionally unclear&quot; about its exact legal claims, but it is acknowledged that &quot;the simplest claim would be trademark misappropriation or dilution towards someone who produced a color palette marketed as compatible with Pantone&#x27;s&quot;.

By contrast, intellectual property scholar Aaron Perzanowski claims that Pantone has no intellectual property rights over individual colors or color libraries.

<text>Charles Louis de Secondat, baron de La Brède et de Montesquieu (18 January 168910 February 1755), generally referred to as simply Montesquieu, was a French judge, man of letters, historian, and political philosopher.

He is the principal source of the theory of separation of powers, which is implemented in many constitutions throughout the world. He is also known for doing more than any other author to secure the place of the word &quot;despotism&quot; in the political lexicon. His anonymously published &quot;The Spirit of Law&quot; (1748), which was received well in both Great Britain and the American colonies, influenced the Founding Fathers of the United States in drafting the U.S. Constitution.

==Biography==

Montesquieu was born at the Château de la Brède in southwest France, south of Bordeaux. His father, Jacques de Secondat (1654–1713), was a soldier with a long noble ancestry, including descent from Richard de la Pole, Yorkist claimant to the English crown. His mother, Marie Françoise de Pesnel (1665–1696), who died when Charles was seven, was an heiress who brought the title of Barony of La Brède to the Secondat family. 

His family was of Huguenot origin. After the death of his mother he was sent to the Catholic College of Juilly, a prominent school for the children of French nobility, where he remained from 1700 to 1711. His father died in 1713, and he became a ward of his uncle, the Baron de Montesquieu. In 1714, he became a counselor of the Bordeaux Parlement. He showed a preference for Protestantism. 

In 1715 he married the Protestant Jeanne de Lartigue, with whom he eventually had three children. The Baron died in 1716, leaving him his fortune as well as his title, and the office of président à mortier in the Bordeaux Parlement, a post that he held for twelve years.

Montesquieu&#x27;s early life was a time of significant governmental change. England had declared itself a constitutional monarchy in the wake of its Glorious Revolution (1688–1689), and joined with Scotland in the Union of 1707 to form the Kingdom of Great Britain. In France, the long-reigning Louis XIV died in 1715, and was succeeded by the five-year-old Louis XV. These national transformations had a great impact on Montesquieu, and he referred to them repeatedly in his work.

Montesquieu eventually withdrew from the practice of law to devote himself to study and writing. He achieved literary success with the publication of his 1721 &quot;Persian Letters&quot; (), a satire representing society as seen through the eyes of two Persian visitors to Paris, cleverly criticizing absurdities of contemporary French society. The work was an instant classic and accordingly was immediately pirated. 

In 1722, he went to Paris and entered social circles with the help of friends including the Duke of Berwick whom he had known when Berwick was military governor at Bordeaux. He also acquainted himself with the English politician Viscount Bolingbroke, some of whose political views were later reflected in Montesquieu&#x27;s analysis of the English constitution. In 1726 he sold his office, bored with the parlement and turning more toward Paris. In time, despite some impediments he was elected to the &quot;Académie Française&quot; in January 1728.

In April 1728, with Berwick&#x27;s nephew Lord Waldegrave as his traveling companion, Montesquieu embarked on a grand tour of Europe, during which he kept a journal. His travels included Austria and Hungary and a year in Italy. He went to England at the end of October 1729, in the company of Lord Chesterfield, where he was initiated into Freemasonry at the &quot;Horn Tavern&quot; Lodge in Westminster. He remained in England until the spring of 1731, when he returned to La Brède. Outwardly he seemed to be settling down as a squire: he altered his park in the English fashion, made inquiries into his own genealogy, and asserted his seignorial rights. But he was continuously at work in his study, and his reflections on geography, laws and customs during his travels became the primary sources for his major works on political philosophy at this time. 

In 1734, he published &quot;Considerations on the Causes of the Greatness of the Romans and their Decline&quot;, among his three best known books. In 1748, he published &quot;The Spirit of Law&quot;, quickly translated into English. It quickly rose to influence political thought profoundly in Europe and America. In France, the book met with an enthusiastic reception by many, but was denounced by the Sorbonne and, in 1751, by the Catholic Church (Index of Prohibited Books). It received the highest praise from much of the rest of Europe, especially Britain.
Montesquieu was highly regarded in the British colonies in North America as a champion of liberty. According to a survey of late eighteenth-century works by political scientist Donald Lutz, Montesquieu was the most frequently quoted authority on government and politics in colonial pre-revolutionary British America, cited more by the American founders than any source except for the Bible. Following the American Revolution, his work remained a powerful influence on many of the American founders, most notably James Madison of Virginia, the &quot;Father of the Constitution&quot;. Montesquieu&#x27;s philosophy that &quot;government should be set up so that no man need be afraid of another&quot; reminded Madison and others that a free and stable foundation for their new national government required a clearly defined and balanced separation of powers.

Montesquieu was troubled by a cataract and feared going blind. At the end of 1754 he visited Paris and was soon taken ill. He died from a fever on 10 February 1755. He was buried in the Église Saint-Sulpice, Paris.

==Philosophy of history==
Montesquieu&#x27;s philosophy of history minimized the role of individual persons and events. He expounded the view in &quot;Considerations on the Causes of the Greatness of the Romans and their Decline&quot;, that each historical event was driven by a principal movement:

In discussing the transition from the Republic to the Empire, he suggested that if Caesar and Pompey had not worked to usurp the government of the Republic, other men would have risen in their place. The cause was not the ambition of Caesar or Pompey, but the ambition of man.

==Political views==
Montesquieu is credited as being among the progenitors, who include Herodotus and Tacitus, of anthropology—as being among the first to extend comparative methods of classification to the political forms in human societies. Indeed, the French political anthropologist Georges Balandier considered Montesquieu to be &quot;the initiator of a scientific enterprise that for a time performed the role of cultural and social anthropology&quot;. According to social anthropologist D. F. Pocock, Montesquieu&#x27;s &quot;The Spirit of Law&quot; was &quot;the first consistent attempt to survey the varieties of human society, to classify and compare them and, within society, to study the inter-functioning of institutions.&quot; &quot;Émile Durkheim,&quot; notes David W. Carrithers, &quot;even went so far as to suggest that it was precisely this realization of the interrelatedness of social phenomena that brought social science into being.&quot; 

Montesquieu&#x27;s political anthropology gave rise to his influential view that forms of government are supported by governing principles: virtue for republics, honor for monarchies, and fear for despotisms. American founders studied Montesquieu&#x27;s views on how the English achieved liberty by separating executive, legislative, and judicial powers, and when Catherine the Great wrote her &quot;Nakaz&quot; (Instruction) for the Legislative Assembly she had created to clarify the existing Russian law code, she avowed borrowing heavily from Montesquieu&#x27;s &quot;Spirit of Law&quot;, although she discarded or altered portions that did not support Russia&#x27;s absolutist bureaucratic monarchy.

Montesquieu&#x27;s most influential work divided French society into three classes (or &quot;trias politica&quot;, a term he coined): the monarchy, the aristocracy, and the commons. Montesquieu saw two types of governmental power existing: the and the administrative. The administrative powers were the executive, the legislative, and the judicial. These should be separate from and dependent upon each other so that the influence of any one power would not be able to exceed that of the other two, either singly or in combination. This was a radical idea because it does not follow the three Estates structure of the French Monarchy: the clergy, the aristocracy, and the people at large represented by the Estates-General, thereby erasing the last vestige of a feudalistic structure.

The theory of the separation of powers largely derives from &quot;The Spirit of Law&quot;:

Montesquieu argues that each power should only exercise its own functions; he is quite explicit here:

If the legislative branch appoints the executive and judicial powers, as Montesquieu indicated, there will be no separation or division of its powers, since the power to appoint carries with it the power to revoke.

Montesquieu identifies three main forms of government, each supported by a social &quot;principle&quot;: monarchies (free governments headed by a hereditary figure, e.g. king, queen, emperor), which rely on the principle of honor; republics (free governments headed by popularly elected leaders), which rely on the principle of virtue; and despotisms (unfree), headed by despots which rely on fear. The free governments are dependent on constitutional arrangements that establish checks and balances. Montesquieu devotes one chapter of &quot;The Spirit of Law&quot; to a discussion of how the England&#x27;s constitution sustained liberty (XI, 6), and another to the realities of English politics (XIX, 27). As for France, the intermediate powers (including the nobility) the nobility and the parlements had been weakened by Louis XIV, and welcomed the strengthening of parlementary power in 1715.

Montesquieu advocated reform of slavery in &quot;The Spirit of Law&quot;, specifically arguing that slavery was inherently wrong because all humans are born equal, but that it could perhaps be justified within the context of climates with intense heat, wherein laborers would feel less inclined to work voluntarily. As part of his advocacy he presented a satirical hypothetical list of arguments for slavery. In the hypothetical list, he&#x27;d ironically list pro-slavery arguments without further comment, including an argument stating that sugar would become too expensive without the free labor of slaves.

While addressing French readers of his &quot;General Theory&quot;, John Maynard Keynes described Montesquieu as &quot;the real French equivalent of Adam Smith, the greatest of your economists, head and shoulders above the physiocrats in penetration, clear-headedness and good sense (which are the qualities an economist should have).&quot;

== Meteorological climate theory ==

Another example of Montesquieu&#x27;s anthropological thinking, outlined in &quot;The Spirit of Law&quot; and hinted at in &quot;Persian Letters&quot;, is his meteorological climate theory, which holds that climate may substantially influence the nature of man and his society, a theory also promoted by the French naturalist Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon. By placing an emphasis on environmental influences as a material condition of life, Montesquieu prefigured modern anthropology&#x27;s concern with the impact of material conditions, such as available energy sources, organized production systems, and technologies, on the growth of complex socio-cultural systems.

He asserted that certain climates are more favorable than others, the temperate climate of France being ideal. His view is that people living in very warm countries are &quot;too hot-tempered&quot;, while those in northern countries are &quot;icy&quot; or &quot;stiff&quot;. The climate of middle Europe is therefore optimal. On this point, Montesquieu may well have been influenced by a similar pronouncement in &quot;The Histories&quot; of Herodotus, where he makes a distinction between the &quot;ideal&quot; temperate climate of Greece as opposed to the overly cold climate of Scythia and the overly warm climate of Egypt. This was a common belief at the time, and can also be found within the medical writings of Herodotus&#x27; times, including the &quot;On Airs, Waters, Places&quot; of the Hippocratic corpus. One can find a similar statement in &quot;Germania&quot; by Tacitus, one of Montesquieu&#x27;s favorite authors.

Philip M. Parker, in his book &quot;Physioeconomics&quot; (MIT Press, 2000), endorses Montesquieu&#x27;s theory and argues that much of the economic variation between countries is explained by the physiological effect of different climates.

From a sociological perspective, Louis Althusser, in his analysis of Montesquieu&#x27;s revolution in method, alluded to the seminal character of anthropology&#x27;s inclusion of material factors, such as climate, in the explanation of social dynamics and political forms. Examples of certain climatic and geographical factors giving rise to increasingly complex social systems include those that were conducive to the rise of agriculture and the domestication of wild plants and animals.

== Memorialization ==
Between 1981 and 1994, a depiction of Monetesquieu appeared on the 200 French franc note.

Since 1989, the annual Montesquieu prize has been awarded by the French Association of Historians of Political Ideas for the best French-language thesis on the history of political thought.

On Europe Day 2007, the Montesquieu Institute opened in The Hague, the Netherlands, with a mission to advance research and education on the parliamentary history and political culture of the European Union and its member states.

The Montesquieu tower in Luxembourg was completed in 2008 as an addition to the headquarters of the Court of Justice of the European Union. The building houses many of the institution&#x27;s translation services. Until 2019, it stood, with its sister tower, Comenius, as the tallest building in the country.

<text>The Younger Dryas (YD, Greenland Stadial GS-1) was a period in Earth&#x27;s geologic history that occurred circa 12,900 to 11,700 years Before Present (BP). It is primarily known for the sudden or &quot;abrupt&quot; cooling in the Northern Hemisphere, when the North Atlantic Ocean cooled and annual air temperatures decreased by ~ over North America, in Europe and up to in Greenland, in a few decades. Cooling in Greenland was particularly rapid, taking place over just 3 years or less. At the same time, the Southern Hemisphere experienced warming. This period ended as rapidly as it began, with dramatic warming over ~50 years, the transition from the glacial Pleistocene epoch into the current Holocene. 

The Younger Dryas onset was not fully synchronized; in the tropics, the cooling was spread out over several centuries, and the same was true of the early-Holocene warming. Even in the Northern Hemisphere, temperature change was highly seasonal, with much colder winters, cooler springs, yet no change or even slight warming during the summer. Substantial changes in precipitation also took place, with cooler areas experiencing substantially lower rainfall, while warmer areas received more of it. In the Northern Hemisphere, the length of the growing season declined. Land ice cover experienced little net change, but sea ice extent had increased, contributing to ice–albedo feedback. This increase in albedo was the main reason for net global cooling of . 

During the preceding period, the Bølling–Allerød Interstadial, rapid warming in the Northern Hemisphere was offset by the equivalent cooling in the Southern Hemisphere. This &quot;polar seesaw&quot; pattern is consistent with changes in thermohaline circulation (particularly the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation or AMOC), which greatly affects how much heat is able to go from the Southern Hemisphere to the North. The Southern Hemisphere cools and the Northern Hemisphere warms when the AMOC is strong, and the opposite happens when it is weak. The scientific consensus is that severe AMOC weakening explains the climatic effects of the Younger Dryas. It also explains why the Holocene warming had proceeded so rapidly once the AMOC change was no longer counteracting the increase in carbon dioxide levels.

AMOC weakening causing polar seesaw effects is also consistent with the accepted explanation for Dansgaard–Oeschger events, with YD likely to have been the last and the strongest of these events. However, there is some debate over what caused the AMOC to become so weak in the first place. The hypothesis historically most supported by scientists was an interruption from an influx of fresh, cold water from North America&#x27;s Lake Agassiz into the Atlantic Ocean. While there is evidence of meltwater travelling via the Mackenzie River, this hypothesis may not be consistent with the lack of sea level rise during this period, so other theories have also emerged. Another proposed explanation is an extraterrestrial impact, but this is rejected by most experts. A volcanic eruption as an initial trigger for cooling and sea ice growth has been proposed more recently, and the presence of anomalously high levels of volcanism immediately preceding the onset of the Younger Dryas has been confirmed in both ice cores and cave deposits. 

== Etymology ==

The Younger Dryas is named after the alpine–tundra wildflower &quot;Dryas octopetala&quot;, because its fossils are abundant in the European (particularly Scandinavian) sediments dating to this timeframe. The two earlier geologic time intervals where this flower was abundant in Europe are the Oldest Dryas (approx. 18,500-14,000 BP) and Older Dryas (~14,050–13,900 BP), respectively. On the contrary, &quot;Dryas octopetala&quot; was rare during the Bølling–Allerød Interstadial. Instead, European temperatures were warm enough to support trees in Scandinavia, as seen at the Bølling and Allerød sites in Denmark.

In Ireland, the Younger Dryas has also been known as the Nahanagan Stadial, and in Great Britain it has been called the Loch Lomond Stadial. In the Greenland Summit ice core chronology, the Younger Dryas corresponds to Greenland Stadial 1 (GS-1). The preceding Allerød warm period (interstadial) is subdivided into three events: Greenland Interstadial-1c to 1a (GI-1c to GI-1a).

== Climate ==

As with the other geologic periods, paleoclimate during the Younger Dryas is reconstructed through proxy data such as traces of pollen, ice cores and layers of marine and lake sediments. Collectively, this evidence shows that significant cooling across the Northern Hemisphere began around 12,870 ± 30 years BP. It was particularly severe in Greenland, where temperatures declined by , in an abrupt fashion. Temperatures at the Greenland summit were up to colder than at the start of the 21st century. 

Strong cooling of around had also taken place in Europe. Icefields and glaciers formed in upland areas of Great Britain, while many lowland areas developed permafrost, implying a cooling of and a mean annual temperature no higher than . North America also became colder, particularly in the eastern and central areas. While the Pacific Northwest region cooled by , cooling in western North America was generally less intense. While the Orca Basin in the Gulf of Mexico still experienced a drop in sea surface temperature of 2.4 ± 0.6°C, land areas closer to it, such as Texas, the Grand Canyon area and New Mexico, ultimately did not cool as much as the continental interior. The Southeastern United States became warmer and wetter than before. There was warming in and around the Caribbean Sea, and in West Africa.

It was once believed that the Younger Dryas cooling started at around the same time across the Northern Hemisphere. However, varve (sedimentary rock) analysis carried out in 2015 suggested that the cooling proceeded in two stages: first along latitude 56–54°N, 12,900–13,100 years ago, and then further north, 12,600–12,750 years ago. Evidence from Lake Suigetsu cores in Japan and the Puerto Princesa cave complex in the Philippines shows that the onset of the Younger Dryas in East Asia was delayed by several hundred years relative to the North Atlantic. Further, the cooling was uniform throughout the year, but had a distinct seasonal pattern. In most places in the Northern Hemisphere, winters became much colder than before, but springs cooled by less, while there was either no temperature change or even slight warming during the summer. An exception appears to have taken place in what is now Maine, where winter temperatures remained stable, yet summer temperatures decreased by up to . 

While the Northern Hemisphere cooled, considerable warming occurred in the Southern Hemisphere. Sea surface temperatures were warmer by , and Antarctica, South America (south of Venezuela) and New Zealand all experienced warming. The net temperature change was a relatively modest cooling of . Temperature changes of the Younger Dryas lasted 1,150–1,300 years. According to the International Commission on Stratigraphy, the Younger Dryas ended around 11,700 years ago, although some research places it closer to 11,550 years ago. 

The end of Younger Dryas was also abrupt: in previously cooled areas, warming to previous levels took place over 50–60 years. The tropics experienced more gradual temperature recovery over several centuries; the exception was in tropical Atlantic areas such as Costa Rica, where temperature change was similar to Greenland&#x27;s. The Holocene warming then proceeded across the globe, following an increase in carbon dioxide levels during the YD period (from ~210 ppm to ~275 ppm). 

=== Ice cover ===
Younger Dryas cooling was often accompanied by glacier advance and lowering of the regional snow line, with evidence found in areas such as Scandinavia, the Swiss Alps and the Dinaric Alps in the Balkans, northern ranges of North America&#x27;s Rocky Mountains, Two Creeks Buried Forest in Wisconsin and western parts of the New York State, and in the Pacific Northwest, including the Cascade Range. The entire Laurentide ice sheet had advanced between west Lake Superior and southeast Quebec, leaving behind a layer of rock debris (moraine) dated to this period. Southeastern Alaska appears to have escaped glaciation; speleothem calcite deposition continued in the region despite being retarded, indicating the absence of permafrost and glaciation. 

On the other hand, the warming of the Southern Hemisphere led to ice loss in Antarctica, South America and New Zealand. Moreover, while Greenland as a whole had cooled, glaciers had only grown in the north of the island, and they had retreated from the rest of Greenland&#x27;s coasts. This was likely driven by the strengthened Irminger Current. The Jabllanica mountain range in the Balkans also experienced ice loss and glacial retreat: this was likely caused by the drop in annual precipitation, which would have otherwise frozen and helped to maintain the glaciers. Unlike now, the glaciers were still present in northern Scotland, but they had thinned during the Younger Dryas.

The amount of water contained within glaciers directly influences global sea levels - sea level rise occurs if the glaciers retreat, and it drops if glaciers grow. Altogether, there appears to have been little change in sea level throughout the Younger Dryas. This is in contrast to rapid increases before and after, such as the Meltwater Pulse 1A. On the coasts, glacier advance and retreat also affects relative sea level. Western Norway experienced a relative sea level rise of as the Scandinavian ice sheet advanced. Notably, ice sheet advance in this area appears to have begun about 600 years before the global onset of the Younger Dryas. Underwater, the deposits of methane clathrate - methane frozen into ice - remained stable throughout the Younger Dryas, including during the rapid warming as it ended.

=== Weather systems ===
As the Northern Hemisphere cooled and the Southern Hemisphere warmed, the thermal equator would have shifted to the south. Because trade winds from either hemisphere cancel each other out above the thermal equator in a calm, heavily clouded area known as the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), a change in its position affects wind patterns elsewhere. For instance, in East Africa, the sediments of Lake Tanganyika were mixed less strongly during this period, indicating weaker wind systems in this area. Shifts in atmospheric patterns are believed to be the main reason why Northern Hemisphere summers generally did not cool during the Younger Dryas.

Since winds carry moisture in the form of clouds, these changes also affect precipitation. Thus, evidence from the pollen record shows that some areas have become very arid, including Scotland, the North American Midwest, Anatolia and southern China. As North Africa, including the Sahara Desert, became drier, the amount of dust blown by wind had also increased. Other areas became wetter including northern China (possibly excepting the Shanxi region)
== Biosphere ==

The Younger Dryas was initially discovered around the start of the 20th century, through paleobotanical and lithostratigraphic studies of Swedish and Danish bog and lake sites, particularly the Allerød clay pit in Denmark. The analysis of fossilized pollen had consistently shown how &quot;Dryas octopetala&quot;, a plant which only thrives in glacial conditions, began to dominate where forests were able to grow during the preceding B-A Interstadial. This makes the Younger Dryas a key example of how biota responded to abrupt climate change.

For instance, in what is now New England, cool summers, combined with cold winters and low precipitation, resulted in a treeless tundra up to the onset of the Holocene, when the boreal forests shifted north. Along the southern margins of the Great Lakes, spruce dropped rapidly, while pine increased, and herbaceous prairie vegetation decreased in abundance, but increased west of the region. The central Appalachian Mountains remained forested during the Younger Dryas, but they were covered in spruce and tamarack boreal forests, switching to temperate broadleaf and mixed forests during the Holocene. Conversely, pollen and macrofossil evidence from near Lake Ontario indicates that cool, boreal forests persisted into the early Holocene. 

An increase of pine pollen indicates cooler winters within the central Cascades. Speleothems from the Oregon Caves National Monument and Preserve in southern Oregon&#x27;s Klamath Mountains yield evidence of climatic cooling contemporaneous to the Younger Dryas. On the Olympic Peninsula, a mid-elevation site recorded a decrease in fire, but forest persisted and erosion increased during the Younger Dryas, which suggests cool and wet conditions. Speleothem records indicate an increase in precipitation in southern Oregon, the timing of which coincides with increased sizes of pluvial lakes in the northern Great Basin. Pollen record from the Siskiyou Mountains suggests a lag in timing of the Younger Dryas, indicating a greater influence of warmer Pacific conditions on that range.

Effects in the Rocky Mountain region were varied. Several sites show little to no changes in vegetation. In the northern Rockies, a significant increase in pines and firs suggests warmer conditions than before and a shift to subalpine parkland in places. That is hypothesized to be the result of a northward shift in the jet stream, combined with an increase in summer insolation as well as a winter snow pack that was higher than today, with prolonged and wetter spring seasons. 
=== Human societies ===
The Younger Dryas is often linked to the Neolithic Revolution, with the adoption of agriculture in the Levant. The cold and dry Younger Dryas arguably lowered the carrying capacity of the area and forced the sedentary early Natufian population into a more mobile subsistence pattern. Further climatic deterioration is thought to have brought about cereal cultivation. While relative consensus exists regarding the role of the Younger Dryas in the changing subsistence patterns during the Natufian, its connection to the beginning of agriculture at the end of the period is still being debated.

== Cause ==
The scientific consensus links the Younger Dryas with a significant reduction or shutdown of the thermohaline circulation, which circulates warm tropical waters northward through the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC). This is consistent with climate model simulations, as well as a range of proxy evidence, such as the decreased ventilation (exposure to oxygen from the surface) of the lowest layers of North Atlantic water. Cores from the western subtropical North Atlantic show that the &quot;bottom water&quot; lingered there for 1,000 years, twice the age of Late Holocene bottom waters from the same site around 1,500 BP. Further, the otherwise anomalous warming of the southeastern United States matches the hypothesis that as the AMOC weakened and transported less heat from the Caribbean towards Europe through the North Atlantic Gyre, more of it would stay trapped in the coastal waters.

It was originally hypothesized that the massive outburst from paleohistorical Lake Agassiz had flooded the North Atlantic via the Saint Lawrence Seaway, but little geological evidence had been found. For instance, the salinity in the Saint Lawrence Seaway did not decline, as would have been expected from massive quantities of meltwater. More recent research instead shows that floodwaters followed a pathway along the Mackenzie River in present-day Canada, and sediment cores show that the strongest outburst had occurred right before the onset of Younger Dryas.

Other factors are also likely to have played a major role in the Younger Dryas climate. For instance, some research suggests climate in Greenland was primarily affected by the melting of then-present Fennoscandian ice sheet, which could explain why Greenland experienced the most abrupt climatic changes during the YD. Climate models also indicate that a single freshwater outburst, no matter how large, would not have been able to weaken the AMOC for over 1,000 years, as required by the Younger Dryas timeline, unless other factors were also involved. Some modelling explains this by showing that the melting of Laurentide Ice Sheet led to greater rainfall over the Atlantic Ocean, freshening it and so helping to weaken the AMOC. Once the Younger Dryas began, lowered temperatures would have elevated snowfall across the Northern Hemisphere, increasing the ice-albedo feedback. Further, melting snow would be more likely to flood back into the North Atlantic than rainfall would, as less water would be absorbed into the frozen ground. Other modelling shows that sea ice in the Arctic Ocean could have been tens of meters thick by the onset of the Younger Dryas, so that it would have been able to shed icebergs into the North Atlantic, which would have been able to weaken the circulation consistently. Notably, changes in sea ice cover would have had no impact on sea levels, which is consistent with the absence of significant sea level rise during the Younger Dryas, and particularly during its onset. 

Some scientists also explain the lack of sea level rise during the Younger Dryas onset by connecting it with a volcanic eruption. Eruptions often deposit large quantities of sulfur dioxide particles in the atmosphere, where they are known as aerosols, and can have a large cooling effect by reflecting sunlight. This phenomenon can also be caused by anthropogenic sulfur pollution, where it is known as global dimming. Cooling from a high latitude volcanic eruption could have accelerated North Atlantic sea ice growth, finally tipping the AMOC sufficiently to cause the Younger Dryas. Cave deposits and glacial ice cores both contain evidence of at least one major volcanic eruption taking place in the northern hemisphere at a time close to Younger Dryas onset, perhaps even completely matching the stalagmite-derived date for the onset of the Younger Dryas event. It has been suggested that this eruption would have been stronger than any during the Common Era, some of which have been able to cause several decades of cooling. 

According to 1990s research, the Laacher See eruption (present-day volcanic lake in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany) would have matched the criteria, but radiocarbon dating done in 2021 pushes the date of the eruption back to 13,006 years BP, or over a century before the Younger Dryas began. This analysis was also challenged in 2023, with some researchers suggesting that the radiocarbon analysis was tainted by magmatic carbon dioxide. For now, the debate continues without a conclusive proof or rejection of the volcanic hypothesis.

=== Younger Dryas impact hypothesis ===
The Younger Dryas impact hypothesis (YDIH) attributes the cooling to the impact of a disintegrating comet or asteroid. Because there is no impact crater dating to the Younger Dryas period, the proponents usually suggest the impact had struck the Laurentide ice sheet, so that the crater would have disappeared when the ice sheet melted during the Holocene, or that it was an airburst, which would only leave micro- and nanoparticles behind as evidence. Most experts reject the hypothesis, and argue that all of the microparticles are adequately explained by the terrestrial processes. For instance, mineral inclusions from YD-period sediments in Hall&#x27;s Cave, Texas, have been interpreted by YDIH proponents as extraterrestrial in origin, but a paper published in 2020 argues that they are more likely to be volcanic. Opponents argue that there is no evidence for massive wildfires which would have been caused by an airburst of sufficient size to affect the thermohaline circulation, mineralogical and geochemical evidence or for simultaneous human population declines and mass animal extinctions which would have been required by this hypothesis.

=== Similar events ===

Statistical analysis shows that the Younger Dryas is merely the last of 25 or 26 Dansgaard–Oeschger events (D–O events) over the past 120,000 years. These episodes are characterized by abrupt changes in the AMOC on timescales of decades or centuries. The Younger Dryas is the best known and best understood because it is the most recent, but it is fundamentally similar to the previous cold phases over the past 120,000 years. This similarity makes the impact hypothesis very unlikely, and it may also contradict the Lake Agassiz hypothesis. On the other hand, some research links volcanism with D–O events, potentially supporting the volcanic hypothesis. 

Events similar to the Younger Dryas appear to have occurred during the other terminations - a term used to describe a comparatively rapid transition from cold glacial conditions to warm interglacials. The analysis of lake and marine sediments can reconstruct past temperatures from the presence or absence of certain lipids and long chain alkenones, as these molecules are very sensitive to temperature. This analysis provides evidence for YD-like events during Termination II (the end of the Marine Isotope Stage 6, ~130,000 years BP), III (the end of Marine Isotope Stage 8, ~243,000 years BP) and Termination IV (the end of Marine Isotope Stage 10, ~337,000 years BP. When combined with additional evidence from ice cores and paleobotanical data, some have argued that YD-like events inevitably occur during every deglaciation.

== In popular culture ==
The 2004 film, &quot;The Day After Tomorrow&quot; depicts catastrophic climatic effects following the disruption of the North Atlantic Ocean circulation that results in a series of extreme weather events that create an abrupt climate change that leads to a new ice age.

<doc id="54958" wikidata="Q310476" url="?curid=54958" title="Fats Waller">
<text>Thomas Wright &quot;Fats&quot; Waller (May 21, 1904 – December 15, 1943) was an American jazz pianist, organist, composer, and singer. His innovations in the Harlem stride style laid much of the basis for modern jazz piano. A widely popular star in the jazz and swing eras, he toured internationally, achieving critical and commercial success in the United States and Europe. His best-known compositions, &quot;Ain&#x27;t Misbehavin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Honeysuckle Rose&quot;, were inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1984 and 1999.

Waller copyrighted over 400 songs, many of them co-written with his closest collaborator, Andy Razaf. Razaf described his partner as &quot;the soul of melody... a man who made the piano sing... both big in body and in mind... known for his generosity... a bubbling bundle of joy&quot;. It is likely that he composed many more popular songs than he has been credited with. When in financial difficulties, he had a habit of selling songs to other writers and performers who claimed them as their own. He died from pneumonia, aged 39.

==Early life==
Waller was the seventh child of 11 (five of whom survived childhood) born to Adeline Locket Waller, a musician, and Reverend Edward Martin Waller, a trucker and pastor in New York City. He started playing the piano when he was six and began playing the organ at his father&#x27;s church four years later. His mother instructed him in his youth, and he attended other music lessons, paying for them by working in a grocery store. Waller attended DeWitt Clinton High School for one semester, but left school at 15 to work as an organist at the Lincoln Theater in Harlem, where he earned $32 a week. Within 12 months he had composed his first rag. He was the prize pupil and later the friend and colleague of the stride pianist James P. Johnson. Waller also studied composition at the Juilliard School with Carl Bohm and Leopold Godowsky. His mother died on November 10, 1920, from a stroke due to diabetes.

Waller&#x27;s first recordings, &quot;Muscle Shoals Blues&quot; and &quot;Birmingham Blues,&quot; were made in October 1922 for Okeh Records. That year, he also made his first player piano roll, &quot;Got to Cool My Doggies Now&quot;. Waller&#x27;s first published composition, &quot;Squeeze Me&quot;, was published in 1924.

==Career==
Pianist and composer Oscar Levant called Waller &quot;the black Horowitz&quot;. Working with his long-time songwriting partner, lyricist Andy Razaf, Fats also wrote the music and/or performed in several successful Broadway musicals, including 1928&#x27;s &quot;Keep Shufflin&quot;&#x27;, 1929&#x27;s &quot;Hot Chocolates&quot; and (with lyricist George Marion Jr.) 1943&#x27;s &quot;Early To Bed&quot;.

Waller is believed to have composed many novelty tunes in the 1920s and 1930s and sold them for small sums, attributed to another composer and lyricist.

Standards attributed to Waller, sometimes controversially, include &quot;I Can&#x27;t Give You Anything but Love, Baby&quot;. The song was made famous by Adelaide Hall in the Broadway show &quot;Blackbirds of 1928&quot;.

Biographer Barry Singer offered circumstantial evidence that this song was written by Waller and lyricist Andy Razaf and provided a description of the sale given by Waller to the &quot;New York Post&quot; in 1929he sold the song for $500 to a white songwriter for use in a financially successful show (consistent with Jimmy McHugh&#x27;s contributions to &quot;Harry Delmar&#x27;s Revels&quot;, 1927, and then to &quot;Blackbirds of 1928&quot;). He noted that early handwritten manuscripts in the Dana Library Institute of Jazz Studies of &quot;Spreadin&#x27; Rhythm Around&quot; (Jimmy McHugh 1935) are in Waller&#x27;s hand. Jazz historian Paul S. Machlin commented that the Singer conjecture has &quot;considerable [historical] justification&quot;. According to a biography by Waller&#x27;s son Maurice, Waller told his son never to play the song within earshot because he had to sell it when he needed money. Maurice Waller wrote that his father objected to hearing &quot;On the Sunny Side of the Street&quot; on the radio. The famous songwriting team of Jimmy McHugh and Dorothy Fields said the song was inspired by their watching a young couple window shopping at Tiffany&#x27;s.

The anonymous sleeve notes on the 1960 RCA Victor album &quot;Handful of Keys&quot; state that Waller copyrighted over 400 songs, many of them co-written with his closest collaborator, Andy Razaf. Razaf described his partner as &quot;the soul of melody ... a man who made the piano sing ... both big in body and in mind ... known for his generosity ... a bubbling bundle of joy&quot;. In the same notes are comments by clarinetist Gene Sedric, who recorded with Waller in the 1930s. &quot;Fats was the most relaxed man I ever saw in a studio, and so he made everybody else relaxed. After a balance had been taken, we&#x27;d just need one take to make a side, unless it was a kind of difficult number.&quot;


Waller played with Nathaniel Shilkret, Gene Austin, Erskine Tate, Fletcher Henderson, McKinney&#x27;s Cotton Pickers, and Adelaide Hall.

According to Waller, he was kidnapped in Chicago while leaving a performance in 1926. Four men bundled him into a car and took him to the Hawthorne Inn, owned by Al Capone. Waller was ordered inside the building and found a party taking place. With a gun to his back, he was pushed towards a piano and told to play. A terrified Waller realized he was the &quot;surprise guest&quot; at Capone&#x27;s birthday party and was relieved that the kidnappers had no intention of killing him.

In 1926, Waller began his recording association with the Victor Talking Machine Company/RCA Victor, his principal record company for the rest of his life, with the organ solos &quot;St. Louis Blues&quot; and his composition &quot;Lenox Avenue Blues.&quot; Although he recorded with several groups, including Morris&#x27;s Hot Babes (1927), Fats Waller&#x27;s Buddies (1929) (one of the earliest multiracial groups to record), and McKinney&#x27;s Cotton Pickers (1929), his most important contribution to the Harlem stride piano tradition was a series of solo recordings of his compositions: &quot;Handful of Keys&quot;, &quot;Smashing Thirds&quot;, &quot;Numb Fumblin, and &quot;Valentine Stomp&quot; (1929). After sessions with Ted Lewis (1931), Jack Teagarden (1931), and Billy Banks&#x27; Rhythmakers (1932), he began in May 1934 the voluminous series of recordings with a small band known as Fats Waller and his Rhythm. This six-piece group usually included Herman Autrey (sometimes replaced by Bill Coleman or John &quot;Bugs&quot; Hamilton), Gene Sedric or Rudy Powell, and Al Casey.

Waller wrote &quot;Squeeze Me&quot; (1919), &quot;Keepin&#x27; Out of Mischief Now,&quot; &quot;Ain&#x27;t Misbehavin&#x27;&quot; (1929), &quot;Blue Turning Grey Over You,&quot; &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Feeling I&#x27;m Falling&quot; (1929), &quot;Honeysuckle Rose&quot; (1929) and &quot;Jitterbug Waltz&quot; (1942). He composed stride piano display pieces such as &quot;Handful of Keys,&quot; &quot;Valentine Stomp,&quot; and &quot;Viper&#x27;s Drag.&quot;

He enjoyed success touring the United Kingdom and Ireland in the 1930s, appearing on one of the first BBC television broadcasts on September 30, 1938, from the Alexandra Palace studios in London, performing &quot;I&#x27;m Crazy &#x27;Bout My Baby,&quot; &quot;Honeysuckle Rose,&quot; &quot;Neglected,&quot; &quot;Hallelujah,&quot; and &quot;Truckin. While in Britain, Waller also recorded a number of songs for EMI on their Compton Theatre organ located in their Abbey Road Studios in St John&#x27;s Wood. He appeared in several feature films and short subject films, most notably &quot;Stormy Weather&quot; in 1943, which was released July 21, just months before his death. For the hit Broadway show &quot;Hot Chocolates&quot;, he and Razaf wrote &quot;(What Did I Do to Be So) Black and Blue&quot; (1929), which became a hit for Ethel Waters and Louis Armstrong.

Waller occasionally performed Bach organ pieces for small groups. He influenced many pre-bebop jazz pianists; Count Basie and Erroll Garner both revived his hit songs. In addition to his playing, Waller was known for his humorous quips during his performances.

Between 1926 and the end of 1927, Waller recorded a series of pipe organ solo records. These represent the first time syncopated jazz compositions were performed on a full-sized church organ. In April 1927, Waller played the organ at the Vendome in Chicago for movies alongside Louis Armstrong, where his organ playing was praised for &quot;witty cueing&quot; and &quot;eccentric stop coupling.&quot;

Waller&#x27;s RCA Victor recording of &quot;A Little Bit Independent,&quot; written by Joe Burke and Edgar Leslie, was No. 1 on &quot;Your Hit Parade&quot; for two weeks in 1935. He also charted with &quot;Whose Honey Are You?&quot;, &quot;Lulu&#x27;s Back in Town,&quot; &quot;Sweet and Low,&quot; &quot;Truckin, &quot;Rhythm and Romance,&quot; &quot;Sing an Old Fashioned Song to a Young Sophisticated Lady,&quot; &quot;West Wind,&quot; &quot;All My Life,&quot; &quot;It&#x27;s a Sin to Tell a Lie,&quot; &quot;Let&#x27;s Sing Again,&quot; &quot;Cross Patch,&quot; &quot;You&#x27;re Not the Kind,&quot; &quot;Bye Bye Baby,&quot; &quot;You&#x27;re Laughing at Me,&quot; &quot;I Love to Whistle,&quot; &quot;Good for Nothing,&quot; &quot;Two Sleepy People&quot;, and &quot;Little Curly Hair in a Highchair.&quot;

===Soundies===
Today&#x27;s audiences can see and hear Waller performing his own works in Soundies musical films. These three-minute selections were filmed in 1941 in New York, by producer Fred Waller (no relation) and director Warren Murray. Waller filmed four songs: &quot;Ain&#x27;t Misbehavin, &quot;Honeysuckle Rose,&quot; &quot;Your Feet&#x27;s Too Big,&quot; and &quot;The Joint Is Jumpin. The films originally played in coin-operated movie jukeboxes and were later reprinted for home movies, television, and video.

=== Broadway musicals ===
Later in Waller&#x27;s career, he had the distinction of becoming the first African-American songwriter to compose a hit Broadway musical that was seen by a mostly white audience. Broadway producer Richard Kollmar&#x27;s hiring of Waller to create the 1943 musical &quot;Early to Bed&quot; was recalled in a 2016 essay about Waller by John McWhorter.Even as late as 1943, the idea of a black composer writing the score for a standard-issue white show was unheard of. When Broadway performer and producer Richard Kollmar began planning &quot;Early to Bed&quot;, his original idea was for Waller to perform in it as a comic character, not to write the music. Waller was, after all, as much a comedian as a musician. Comedy rarely dates well, but almost 80 years later, his comments and timing during &quot;Your Feet&#x27;s Too Big&quot; are as funny as anything on Comedy Central, and he nearly walks away with the movie &quot;Stormy Weather&quot; with just one musical scene and a bit of mugging later on, despite the competition of Bill &quot;Bojangles&quot; Robinson, Lena Horne, and the Nicholas Brothers.

Kollmar&#x27;s original choice for composer [of &quot;Early to Bed&quot;] was Ferde Grofé, best known as the orchestrator of George Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Rhapsody in Blue,&quot; whose signature compositions were portentous concert suites. But Grofé withdrew, and it is to Kollmar&#x27;s credit that he realized that he had a top-rate pop-song composer available in Waller. Waller&#x27;s double duty as composer and performer was short-lived. During a cash crisis and in an advanced state of intoxication, Waller threatened to leave the production unless Kollmar bought the rights to his Early to Bed music for $1,000. (This was typical of Waller, who often sold melodies for quick cash when in his cups. The evidence suggests, for example, that the standards &quot;I Can&#x27;t Give You Anything but Love&quot; and &quot;On the Sunny Side of the Street&quot; were Waller tunes.) Waller came to his senses the next day, but Kollmar decided that his drinking habits made him too risky a proposition for eight performances a week. From then on, Waller was the show&#x27;s composer only, with lyrics by George Marion, whose best-remembered work today is the script for the Astaire-Rogers film &quot;The Gay Divorcée&quot;.

Six months after the premiere of &quot;Early to Bed&quot;, it was still playing in a Broadway theater; at that point, newspapers reported Waller&#x27;s premature death.

==Personal life==
In 1920, Waller married Edith Hatch, with whom he had a son, Thomas Waller Jr., in 1921. In 1923, Hatch divorced Waller. Waller married Anita Rutherford in 1926. Together, they had a son, Maurice Thomas Waller, born on September 10, 1927. In 1928, Waller and Rutherford had their second son, Ronald Waller.

In 1938, Waller was one of the first African Americans to purchase a home in the Addisleigh Park section of St. Albans, Queens, a New York City community with racially restrictive covenants. After his purchase, and litigation in the New York State courts, many prosperous African Americans followed, including many jazz artists, such as Count Basie, Lena Horne, Ella Fitzgerald, and Milt Hinton.

==Death and descendants==
Waller contracted pneumonia and died on December 15, 1943, while traveling aboard the famous cross-country Los Angeles–Chicago train the &quot;Super Chief&quot; near Kansas City, Missouri. Waller was returning to New York City from Los Angeles, after the smash success of &quot;Stormy Weather&quot;, and a successful engagement at the Zanzibar Room in Santa Monica, California, during which he had fallen ill. More than 4,200 people were estimated to have attended his funeral at Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, which prompted Adam Clayton Powell Jr., who delivered the eulogy, to say that Waller &quot;always played to a packed house.&quot; Afterwards, he was cremated and his ashes were scattered over Harlem from an airplane piloted by an unidentified African-American World War I aviator.

American football player Darren Waller is his great-grandson.

==Tribute artists==
Waller had many admirers, during and after his heyday. In 1939, while nightclubbing in Harlem, Waller discovered a white stride pianist playing Waller tunes – the young Harry Gibson. Waller tipped him handsomely and then hired him to be his relief pianist during his own performances.

Waller also had contemporaries in recording studios. Waller recorded for Victor, so Decca Records hired singer-pianist Bob Howard for recordings aimed at Waller&#x27;s audience, and Columbia Records followed suit with Putney Dandridge.

Probably the most talented pianist to keep the music of Waller alive in the years after his death was Ralph Sutton, who focused his career on playing stride piano. Sutton was a great admirer of Waller, saying, &quot;I&#x27;ve never heard a piano man swing any better than Fats – or swing a band better than he could. I never get tired of him. Fats has been with me from the first, and he&#x27;ll be with me as long as I live.&quot;

Actor and bandleader Conrad Janis also did a lot to keep the stride piano music of Waller and James P. Johnson alive. In 1949, as an 18-year-old, Janis put together a band of aging jazz greats, consisting of James P. Johnson (piano), Henry Goodwin (trumpet), Edmond Hall (clarinet), Pops Foster (bass), and Baby Dodds (drums), with Janis on trombone.

A Broadway musical showcasing Waller tunes entitled &quot;Ain&#x27;t Misbehavin&#x27;&quot; was produced in 1978 and featured Nell Carter, Andre de Shields, Armelia McQueen, Ken Page, and Charlaine Woodard. (The show and Nell Carter won Tony Awards.) The show opened at the Longacre Theatre and ran for more than 1600 performances. It was revived on Broadway in 1988 at the Ambassador Theatre with the original Broadway Cast. Performed by five African-American actors, the show included such songs as &quot;Honeysuckle Rose,&quot; &quot;This Joint Is Jumpin, and &quot;Ain&#x27;t Misbehavin&#x27;.&quot;

In 1981, Thin Lizzy released the album &quot;Renegade&quot;, which contained the song &quot;Fats&quot;, co-written by Phil Lynott and Snowy White as a tribute to Waller.

==Recognition and awards==
Waller&#x27;s recordings were inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, a special Grammy Award established in 1973 to honour recordings that are at least 25 years old and that have &quot;qualitative or historical significance.&quot;

==In popular culture==
* Waller is the subject of the Irish poet Michael Longley&#x27;s &quot;Elegy for Fats Waller&quot;.
* Waller&#x27;s version of &quot;Louisiana Fairytale&quot; was used for many years as the theme song to the American television series &quot;This Old House&quot;.
* Waller&#x27;s church organ music featured prominently in David Lynch&#x27;s film &quot;Eraserhead&quot; in 1977.
* In Michel Gondry&#x27;s 2008 film &quot;Be Kind Rewind&quot;, the character Elroy Fletcher (portrayed by Danny Glover) tried to find proof that Fats Waller was born in Passaic, New Jersey at the site of his titular video rental store. He was unable to find any proof of it. Later on in the film, after the &quot;Sweded&quot; videos were destroyed because of copyright violations, his employer Mike (portrayed by Mos Def) led him and some people in their neighborhood in making an alternate history documentary about Fats Waller with Mike portraying Fats Waller.
* The story of Fats Waller&#x27;s performance at Al Capone&#x27;s birthday party was told in the &quot;Mysteries at the Museum&quot; Season 21 episode &quot;Columbus and the Mermaid, Skyscraper Snafu and Stealing the Show&quot;.
* In 1950, the story of Fats Waller was retold as &quot;The Shy Boy&quot; in the weekly &quot;Destination Freedom&quot; radio drama, written by Richard Durham.
*”Ain&#x27;t Misbehavin&#x27;” by Fats Waller is featured in Diamond City Radio, a virtual station in the video game, &quot;Fallout 4&quot;, and likewise in its successor, &quot;Fallout 76&quot;, in its virtual Appalachia Radio. Included in the games&#x27; soundtracks, the composition enhances the retro post-apocalyptic atmosphere, receiving positive player reception for its nostalgic and immersive contribution to the experience. Fats Waller&#x27;s &quot;Jitterbug Waltz&quot; also stars in 2007&#x27;s &quot;BioShock&quot;.
* In “Another Man’s Moccasins”, a Walt Longmire mystery #4, by Craig Johnson, the protagonist, Walter Longmire, plays “A Good Man is Hard to Find” credited to Fats Waller during a flashback to the Vietnam war and later while solving a murder mystery in Wyoming.

<doc id="54959" wikidata="Q1155622" url="?curid=54959" title="Slave rebellion">
<text>A slave rebellion is an armed uprising by slaves, as a way of fighting for their freedom. Rebellions of slaves have occurred in nearly all societies that practice slavery or have practiced slavery in the past. A desire for freedom and the dream of successful rebellion is often the greatest object of song, art, and culture amongst the enslaved population. These events, however, are often violently opposed and suppressed by slaveholders.

Ancient Sparta had a special type of serf called &quot;helots&quot; who were often treated harshly, leading them to rebel. According to Herodotus (IX, 28–29), helots were seven times as numerous as Spartans. Every autumn, according to Plutarch (&quot;Life of Lycurgus&quot;, 28, 3–7), the Spartan ephors would pro forma declare war on the helot population so that any Spartan citizen could kill a helot without fear of blood or guilt in order to keep them in line (&quot;crypteia&quot;). In the Roman Empire, though the heterogeneous nature of the slave population worked against a strong sense of solidarity, slave revolts did occur and were severely punished. The most famous slave rebellion in Europe was led by Spartacus in Roman Italy, the Third Servile War. This war resulted in the 6,000 surviving rebel slaves being crucified along the main roads leading into Rome. This was the third in a series of unrelated Servile Wars fought by slaves against the Romans.

The Mamluk Sultanate reigned for centuries out of a slave rebellion in Egypt. It gave birth to both the Bahri dynasty and Burji dynasty and their countless artistic and scientific achievements. Among many accomplishments, the Mamluks were responsible for turning back the Mongol conquest. In Russia, the slaves were usually classified as kholops. A kholop&#x27;s master had unlimited power over his life. Slavery remained a major institution in Russia until 1723, when Peter the Great converted the household slaves into house serfs. Russian agricultural slaves were formally converted into serfs earlier in 1679. During the 16th and 17th centuries, runaway serfs and kholops known as Cossacks, (&quot;outlaws&quot;) formed autonomous communities in the southern steppes. There were numerous rebellions against slavery and serfdom, most often in conjunction with Cossack uprisings, such as the uprisings of Ivan Bolotnikov (1606–1607), Stenka Razin (1667–1671), Kondraty Bulavin (1707–1709), and Yemelyan Pugachev (1773–1775), often involving hundreds of thousands and sometimes millions. Between the end of the Pugachev rebellion and the beginning of the 19th century, there were hundreds of outbreaks across Russia.

One of the most successful slave rebellions in history was the Haitian Revolution, which saw self-emancipated slaves in the French colony of Saint-Domingue overthrow the colonial government and repulse invasion attempts by the French, Spanish and British to establish the independent state of Haiti. In the 9th century, the poet Ali bin Muhammad led imported East African slaves against the Abbasid Caliphate in Iraq during the Zanj Rebellion. Nanny of the Maroons was an 18th-century leader of the Jamaican Maroons who led them to victory in the First Maroon War. The Quilombo dos Palmares of Brazil flourished under Ganga Zumba. In the United States, the 1811 German Coast Uprising in the Territory of Orleans was the largest rebellion in the continental United States; Denmark Vesey and Madison Washington both launched slave rebellions in the U.S. as well.

==Africa==

In 1808 and 1825, there were slave rebellions in the Cape Colony, newly acquired by the British. Although the slave trade was officially abolished in the British Empire by the Slave Trade Act 1807, and slavery itself a generation later with the Slavery Abolition Act 1833, it took until 1850 to be halted in the territories which were to become South Africa.

===São Tomé and Príncipe===
On 9 July 1595, Rei Amador, and his people, the Angolars, allied with other enslaved Africans of its plantations, marched into the interior woods and battled against the Portuguese. It is said that day, Rei Amador and his followers raised a flag in front of the settlers and proclaimed Rei Amador as king of São Tomé and Príncipe, making himself as &quot;Rei Amador, liberator of all the black people&quot;.

Between 1595 and 1596, part of the island of São Tomé was ruled by the Angolars, under the command of Rei Amador. On 4 January 1596, he was captured, sent to prison and was later executed by the Portuguese. Still today, they remember him fondly and consider him a national hero of the islands.

In the first decades of the 17th century, there were frequent slave revolts in the Portuguese colony of São Tomé and Príncipe, off the African shore, which damaged the sugar crop cultivation there.

==Asia==
The Zanj Rebellion against the slavery in the Abbasid Caliphate was the culmination of a series of small revolts. It took place near the city of Basra, in southern Iraq over fifteen years (869−883 AD). It grew to involve over 500,100 slaves, who were imported from across the Muslim empire.

The Mamluk Sultanate reigned for centuries out of a slave rebellion in Egypt. It gave birth to both the Bahri dynasty and Burji dynasty and their countless artistic and scientific achievements. Among many accomplishments, the Mamluks were responsible for turning back the Mongol conquest.

When the Russian general Konstantin Petrovich von Kaufmann and his army approached the city of Khiva during the Khivan campaign of 1873, the Khan Muhammad Rahim Khan II of Khiva fled to hide among the Yomuts, and the slaves in Khiva rebelled, informed about the imminent downfall of the city, resulting in the Khivan slave uprising.
When Kaufmann&#x27;s Russian army entered Khiva on 28 March, he was approached by Khivans who begged him to put down the ongoing slave uprising, during which slaves avenged themselves on their former enslavers.
When the Khan returned to his capital after the Russian conquest, the Russian General Kaufmann presented him with a demand to abolish the Khivan slave trade and slavery, which he did.

==Europe==
In the 3rd century BCE, Drimakos (or Drimachus) led a slave revolt on the slave entrepot of Chios, took to the hills and directed a band of runaways in operations against their ex-masters.

The Servile Wars (135 to 71 BCE) were a series of slave revolts within the Roman Republic.
* The First and Second Servile War occurred in Sicily.
* The Third Servile War (73 to 71 BCE) occurred in mainland Italy. Spartacus, an escaped gladiator supposedly from Thrace, became the most prominent of the rebel leaders; Marcus Licinius Crassus suppressed the insurgents. Many modern rebels (such as the Spartacus League) have since regarded Spartacus as a heroic figure.
According to the Icelandic sagas, Swedish slave revolts occurred at some time between the 5th and 6th centuries, and resulted in the Swedish king Ongentheow being deposed. These large-scale slave revolts were reportedly led by a thrall known as Tunni. According to the sagas, it resulted in the Swedish king Ongentheow being deposed. Tunni subsequently became king of Svealand after defeating the Swedish king. 

A number of slave revolts occurred in the Mediterranean area during the early modern period:
* 1531: 16 slaves who were imprisoned at Fort St. Angelo in Hospitaller Malta revolted and briefly took control of the fort. The revolt was put down and the leaders were killed.
* 1596: a number of slaves in Birgu and Valletta on Malta mutinied, stole the keys to the gates of Valletta and escaped into the Maltese countryside.
* 1748: Hungarian, Georgian and Maltese slaves on board an Ottoman galley named &quot;Lupa&quot; revolted against Ottoman slavery and sailed the ship to Malta.
* 1749: Muslim slaves in Malta plotted to rebel and take over the island, but plans leaked out beforehand and the would-be rebels were arrested and many were executed.
* 1760: Christian slaves on board the Ottoman ship &quot;Corona Ottomana&quot; revolted and sailed the ship to Malta.

== North America ==

Numerous slave rebellions and insurrections took place in North America during the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries. There is documentary evidence of more than 250 uprisings or attempted uprisings involving ten or more slaves. One of the first was at San Miguel de Gualdape, the first European settlement in what would become the United States. Three of the best known in the United States during the 19th century are the revolts by Gabriel Prosser in Virginia in 1800, Denmark Vesey in Charleston, South Carolina in 1822, and Nat Turner&#x27;s Rebellion in Southampton County, Virginia, in 1831.

Drapetomania was a supposed mental illness invented by American physician Samuel A. Cartwright in 1851 that allegedly caused black slaves to run away. Today, drapetomania is considered an example of pseudoscience, and part of the edifice of scientific racism.

Slave resistance in the antebellum South did not gain the attention of academic historians until the 1940s, when historian Herbert Aptheker started publishing the first serious scholarly work on the subject. Aptheker stressed how rebellions were rooted in the exploitative conditions of the Southern slave system. He traversed libraries and archives throughout the South, managing to uncover roughly 250 similar instances.

The 1811 German Coast Uprising, which took place in rural southeast Louisiana, at that time the Territory of Orleans, early in 1811, involved up to 500 insurgent slaves. It was suppressed by local militias and a detachment of the United States Army. In retaliation for the deaths of two white men and the destruction of property, the authorities killed at least 40 black men in a violent confrontation (the numbers cited are inconsistent); at least 29 more were executed (combined figures from two jurisdictions, St. Charles Parish and Orleans Parish). There was a third jurisdiction for a tribunal and what amounted to summary judgments against the accused, St. John the Baptist Parish. Fewer than 20 men are said to have escaped; some of those were later caught and killed, on their way to freedom.

Although only involving about seventy slaves and free blacks, Turner&#x27;s 1831 rebellion is considered to be a significant event in American history. The rebellion caused the slave-holding South to go into a panic. Fifty-five men, women, and children were killed, and enslaved blacks were freed on multiple plantations in Southampton County, Virginia, as Turner and his fellow rebels attacked the white institution of plantation slavery. Turner and the other rebels were eventually stopped by state militias. The rebellion resulted in the hanging of about 56 slaves, including Nat Turner himself. Up to 200 other blacks were killed during the hysteria that followed, few of whom likely had anything to do with the uprising. White fear led to new legislation passed by Southern states prohibiting the movement, assembly, and education of slaves, and reducing the rights of free people of color. In 1831–32, the Virginia legislature considered a gradual emancipation law to prevent future rebellions. In a close vote, however, the state decided to keep slaves.

The abolitionist John Brown had already fought against pro-slavery forces in Bleeding Kansas for several years when he decided to lead a raid on a Federal arsenal in Harpers Ferry, Virginia. This raid was a joint attack by freed blacks and white men who had corresponded with slaves on plantations in order to create a general uprising among slaves. Brown carried hundreds of copies of the constitution for a new republic of former slaves in the Appalachians. But they were never distributed, and the slave uprisings that were to have helped Brown did not happen. Some believe that he knew the raid was doomed but went ahead anyway, because of the support for abolition it would (and did) generate. The U.S. military, led by Lieutenant Colonel Robert E. Lee, easily overwhelmed Brown&#x27;s forces. But directly following this, slave disobedience and the number of runaways increased markedly in Virginia.

The historian Steven Hahn proposes that the self-organized involvement of slaves in the Union Army during the American Civil War composed a slave rebellion that dwarfed all others. Similarly, tens of thousands of slaves joined British forces or escaped to British lines during the American Revolution, sometimes using the disruption of war to gain freedom. For instance, when the British evacuated from Charleston and Savannah, they took 10,000 freed slaves with them. They also evacuated slaves from New York, taking more than 3,000 for resettlement to Nova Scotia, where they were recorded as Black Loyalists and given land grants.

==Slave ship revolts==
There are 485 recorded instances of slaves revolting on board slave ships. A few of these ships endured more than one uprising during their career.

Most accounts of revolts aboard slave ships are given by Europeans. There are few examples of accounts by slaves themselves. William Snelgrave reported that the slaves who revolted on the British ship &quot;Henry&quot; in 1721 claimed that those who had captured them were &quot;Rogues to buy them&quot; and that they were bent on regaining their liberty. Another example that Richardson gives is that of James Towne who gives the account of slaves stating that Europeans did not have the right to enslave and take them away from their homeland and &quot;wives and children&quot;.

Richardson compares several factors that contributed to slave revolts on board ships: conditions on the ships, geographical location, and proximity to the shore. He suggests that revolts were more likely to occur when a ship was still in sight of the shore. The threat of attack from the shore by other Africans was also a concern. If the ship was hit by disease and a large portion of the crew had been killed, the chances of insurrection were higher. Where the slaves were captured also had an effect on the number of insurrections. In many places, such as the Bight of Benin and the Bight of Biafra, the percentage of revolts and the percentage of the slave trade match up. Yet ships taking slaves from Senegambia experienced 22 percent of shipboard revolts while only contributing to four and a half percent of the slave trade. Slaves coming from West Central Africa accounted for 44 percent of the trade while only experiencing 11 percent of total revolts. 
Lorenzo J. Greene gives many accounts of slave revolts on ships coming out of New England. These ships belonged to Puritans who controlled much of the slave trade in New England. Most revolts on board ships were unsuccessful. The crews of these ships, while outnumbered, were disciplined, well fed, and armed with muskets, swords, and sometimes cannons, and they were always on guard for resistance. The slaves on the other hand were the opposite, armed only with bits of wood and the chains that bound them.

However, some captives were able to take over the ships that were their prisons and regain their freedom. On October 5, 1764 the New Hampshire ship &quot;Adventure&quot; captained by John Millar was successfully taken by the enslaved aboard. The slaves on board revolted while the ship was anchored off the coast and all but two of the crew, including Captain Millar, had succumbed to disease. Another successful slave revolt occurred six days after the ship &quot;Little George&quot; had left the Guinea coast. The ship carried ninety-six slaves, thirty-five of which were male. The slaves attacked in the early hours of the morning, easily overpowering the two men on guard. The slaves were able to load one of the cannons on board and fire it at the crew. After taking control of the ship they sailed it up the Sierra Leone River and escaped. After having defended themselves with muskets for several days below decks the crew lowered a small boat into the river to escape. After nine days of living on raw rice they were rescued.

Mariana P. Candido notes that enslaved Africans worked on the ships that transported other Africans into slavery. These men, 230 in all, were used onboard slave ships for their ability to communicate with the slaves being brought on board and to translate between Captain and slaver. Enslaved sailors were able to alleviate some of the fears that newly boarded slaves had, such as fear of being eaten. This was a double-edged sword. The enslaved sailors sometimes joined other slaves in the revolts against the captain they served. In 1812 enslaved sailors joined a revolt on board the Portuguese ship &quot;Feliz Eugenia&quot; just off the coast of Benguela. The revolt took place below decks. The sailors, along with many of the children who were on board, were able to escape using small boats.

==South America and the Caribbean==
December 25, 1521 rebellion in Diego Colón de Toledo&#x27;s plantation in what is known today as Dominican Republic is the first known slave rebellion of the region. Despite the suppression of this revolt, many of the slaves successfully escaped, which led to the establishment of the first Maroon communities of the Americas. It would also open the doors for more slave revolts to transpire in the region. In 1532, Sebastián Lemba, of the Lemba tribe, rebelled against the Spanish colonists and for the next 15 years, attacked various other villages on the island liberating other slaves and ransacking from the Spaniards. Other leaders such as Juan Vaquero, Diego del Guzmán, Fernando Montoro, Juan Criollo, and Diego del Ocampo followed in Lemba&#x27;s footsteps. Dominican slave revolts continued throughout the 18th and 19th century such as the slave insurrections of Hincha and Samaná in the spring of 1795, the Boca de Nigua revolt in 1796, the Gambia revolt of 1802, and the revolt led by José Leocadio, Pedro de Seda, and Pedro Henríquez in 1812.

In 1552 Miguel de Buría  a former slave in San Juan, Puerto Rico, reigned as the King of Buría Golden mines in the modern-day state of Lara, Venezuela, after leading the first African rebellion in the country&#x27;s history. His incumbency began in 1552 and lasted until 1554 after a failed attempt to take Barquisimeto city was killed by Spanish forces.

Between 1538 and 1542, a Guaraní slave from present-day Paraguay named Juliana killed her Spanish master and urged other indigenous women to do the same, ending up executed by order of Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca. Her rebellion is regarded as one of the earliest recorded indigenous uprisings against the Spanish colonization of the Americas.

Quilombo dos Palmares in Brazil, 1605 to 1694, led by Zumbi dos Palmarés.

San Basilio de Palenque in Colombia, 16th century to the present, led by Benkos Biohó.

St. John, 1733, in what was then the Danish West Indies. The St. John&#x27;s Slave Rebellion is one of the earliest and longest lasting slave rebellions in the Americas. It ended with defeat, however, and many rebels, including one of the leaders Breffu, committed suicide rather than being recaptured.

The most successful slave uprising was the Haitian Revolution, which began in 1791 and was eventually led by Toussaint L&#x27;Ouverture, culminating in the independent black republic of Haiti.

Panama also has an extensive history of slave rebellions going back to the 16th century. Slaves were brought to the isthmus from many regions in Africa, including the modern day countries of the Congo, Senegal, Guinea, and Mozambique. Immediately before their arrival on shore, or very soon after, many enslaved Africans revolted against their captors or participated in mass maroonage or desertion. The freed Africans founded communities in the forests and mountains, organized guerrilla bands known as Cimarrones. They began a long guerrilla war against the Spanish Conquistadores, sometimes in conjunction with nearby indigenous communities like the Kuna and the Guaymí. Despite massacres by the Spanish, the rebels fought until the Spanish crown was forced to concede to treaties that granted the Africans a life without Spanish violence and incursions. The leaders of the guerrilla revolts included Felipillo, Bayano, Juan de Dioso, Domingo Congo, Antón Mandinga, and Luis de Mozambique.

In the 1730s, the militias of the Colony of Jamaica fought the Jamaican Maroons for a decade, before agreeing to sign peace treaties in 1739 and 1740, which recognised their freedom in five separate Maroon Towns.

Tacky&#x27;s War (1760) was a slave uprising in Jamaica, which ran from May to July before it was put down by the British colonial government.

The Suriname slave rebellion was marked by constant guerrilla warfare by Maroons and in 1765–1793 by the Aluku. This rebellion was led by Boni.

The Berbice Slave Rebellion in Guyana in 1763 was led by Cuffy.

Cuba had slave revolts in 1795, 1798, 1802, 1805, 1812 (the Aponte revolt), 1825, 1827, 1829, 1833, 1834, 1835, 1838, 1839–43 and 1844 (the La Escalera conspiracy and revolt).

===Revolts on the Caribbean Islands===

Vincent Brown, a professor of History and of African and African-American Studies at Harvard, has made a study of the Transatlantic Slave Trade. In 2013, Brown teamed up with Axis Maps to create an interactive map of Jamaican slave uprisings in the 18th century called, &quot;Slave Revolt in Jamaica, 1760–1761, A Cartographic Narrative&quot;. Brown&#x27;s efforts have shown that the slave insurrection in Jamaica in 1760-61 was a carefully planned affair and not a spontaneous, chaotic eruption, as was often argued (due in large part to the lack of written records produced by the insurgents). Tacky&#x27;s War was a widespread slave uprising across Jamaica in the 1760s.

Later, in 1795, several slave rebellions broke out across the Caribbean, influenced by the Haitian Revolution: 

*In Martinique the slave rebellion broke out during the French Revolution which compared to the Haitian Revolution led by Toussaint Louverture.
*In Jamaica, the descendants of Africans who fought and escaped from slavery and established free communities in the mountainous interior of Jamaica (Maroons), fought to preserve their freedom from British colonialists, in what came to be known as the Second Maroon War. However, this featured just one of the five Maroon towns in Jamaica. 
*In Dominica there was the Colihault Uprising. 
*In Saint Lucia there was the Bush War in 1795.
*In the Saint Vincent islands the Second Carib War broke out.
*In Grenada there was the Fedon Rebellion.
*Curaçao had a slave revolt in 1795, led by Tula.
*In Venezuela, the insurrection led by José Leonardo Chirino occurred in 1795.
*In Barbados, a slave revolt occurred in 1816, led by Bussa.
*In Guyana there was the Demerara Rebellion of 1795.
*In the British Virgin Islands, minor slave revolts occurred in 1790, 1823 and 1830.
*In Cuba, there were several revolts starting in 1825 with an uprising in Guamacaro and ending with the revolts of 1843 in Matanzas. These revolts have been widely studied by scholars such as Robert L. Paquette, Gloria García, Manuel Barcia, Aisha K. Finch and Michele Reid-Vazquez.
*In the Danish West Indies an 1848 slave revolt led to emancipation of all slaves in the Danish West Indies.
*In Puerto Rico in 1821, Marcos Xiorro planned and conspired to lead a slave revolt against the sugar plantation owners and the Spanish Colonial government. Even though the conspiracy was unsuccessful, Xiorro achieved legendary status among the slaves and is part of Puerto Rico&#x27;s folklore.
*The St. Joseph Mutiny of 1837 in Trinidad, which was led by mutineers from the British Army&#x27;s 1st West India Regiment (many of whom had been liberated from illegal slave ships by the Royal Navy).

===Brazil===
Many slave rebellions occurred in Brazil, most famously the Malê Revolt of 1835 by the predominantly Muslim West African slaves at the time. The term &quot;malê&quot; was commonly used to refer to Muslims at the time from the Yoruba word &quot;imale&quot;.

<text>Nat Turner (October 2, 1800 – November 11, 1831) was an enslaved Black carpenter and preacher who led a four-day rebellion of both enslaved and free Black people in Southampton County, Virginia in August 1831.

Nat Turner&#x27;s Rebellion resulted in the death of 55 white men, women, and children before state militias suppressed the uprising, while 120 Black men, women, and children, many of whom were not involved in the revolt, were killed by soldiers and local mobs in retaliation. Turner was captured in October 1831 and, after a trial, was executed in November. Before his execution, he told his story to attorney Thomas Ruffin Grey, who published &quot;The Confessions of Nat Turner&quot; in November 1831.

In 2002, scholar Molefi Kete Asante included Nat Turner on his list of 100 Greatest African Americans. Turner has been depicted in films, literature, and plays, as well as many scholarly works.

==Early life==
Turner was born into slavery on October 2, 1800, in Southampton County, Virginia. Southampton County was a rural plantation area with more Black people than White. Benjamin Turner, the man who held Nat and his family as slaves, called the infant Nat in his records. Even when grown, the slave was known simply as Nat; but after the 1831 rebellion, he was widely referred to as Nat Turner. 

Turner knew little about the background of his father, who was believed to have escaped from slavery when Turner was a child. However, Turner grew up &quot;much attached to his grandmother&quot;.

Turner learned how to read and write at a young age. He was identified as having &quot;natural intelligence and quickness of apprehension, surpassed by few&quot;. He grew up deeply religious and was often seen fasting, praying, or immersed in reading the stories of the Bible. 

Benjamin Turner died in 1810, and his son Samuel inherited Nat. When he was 21, Nat Turner escaped from Samuel Turner; but he returned a month later, after becoming delirious from hunger and receiving a vision that told him to &quot;return to the service of my earthly master&quot;. In 1830, Joseph Travis purchased Turner; Turner later recalled that Travis was &quot;a kind master&quot; who &quot;placed the greatest confidence&quot; in him. 

An 1831 reward notice described Turner as:5 feet 6 or 8 inches [168–173 cm] high, weighs between 150 and 160 pounds [68–73 kg], rather &quot;bright&quot; [light-colored] complexion, but not a mulatto, broad shoulders, larger flat nose, large eyes, broad flat feet, rather knockneed [&quot;sic&quot;], walks brisk and active, hair on the top of the head very thin, no beard, except on the upper lip and the top of the chin, a scar on one of his temples, also one on the back of his neck, a large knot on one of the bones of his right arm, near the wrist, produced by a blow.

==Visions and religious activities==
Turner had visions that he interpreted as messages from God, and which influenced his life. The historian Patrick Breen stated, &quot;Nat Turner thought that God used the natural world as a backdrop in front of which he placed signs and omens.&quot; Breen further states that Nat Turner claimed he possessed a gift of prophecy and that he could interpret these divine revelations.

Turner often conducted religious services, preaching the Bible to his fellow slaves, who dubbed him &quot;The Prophet&quot;. In addition to Blacks, Turner garnered some White followers such as Ethelred T. Brantley, whom Turner baptized after convincing him to &quot;cease from his wickedness&quot;.

In 1824, Turner had a second vision while working in the fields for Thomas Moore: &quot;The Saviour was about to lay down the yoke he had borne for the sins of men, and the great day of judgment was at hand&quot;.

Historian David Allmendinger notes that Turner had ten different supernatural experiences between 1822 and 1828. These included appearances of both the Spirit communicating through a religious language and scripture along with the visions of the Holy Ghost. By the spring of 1828, Turner was convinced that he &quot;was ordained for some great purpose in the hands of the Almighty&quot;. 

Turner said he &quot;heard a loud noise in the heavens&quot; while working in Moore&#x27;s fields on May 12th &quot;and the Spirit instantly appeared to me and said the Serpent was loosened, and Christ had laid down the yoke he had borne for the sins of men, and that I should take it on and fight against the Serpent, for the time was fast approaching when the first should be last and the last should be first&quot;. Historian and theologian Joseph Dreis says, &quot;In connecting this vision to the motivation for his rebellion, Turner makes it clear that he sees himself as participating in the confrontation between God&#x27;s Kingdom and the anti-Kingdom that characterized his social-historical context.&quot;

During the 1820s, Turner was motivated by strong convictions, at least partly inspired by his religious beliefs, to organize his fellow slaves against enslavement. His deep spiritual commitment served as a significant influence on slaves within the surrounding plantations in Virginia. After Turner viewed the solar eclipse in 1831, he was certain that God wanted the revolt to commence.

==Rebellion==
Over approximately a decade, Turner built up support for his cause, culminating in an anti-slavery uprising that served as a source of inspiration for later abolitionist organizers and rebels. The four-day rebellion started on August 21, 1831.

Nat Turner&#x27;s Rebellion resulted in the death of 55 white men, women, and children. This is considered the &quot;most deadly slave revolt&quot; in United States history. The state militia and local troops quickly suppressed the uprising; between 36 and 120 Black men, women, and children, many of whom were not involved in the revolt, were killed by soldiers and local mobs in retaliation. 

Turner eluded capture but remained in Southampton County, in hiding. On October 30, a farmer named Benjamin Phipps discovered Turner hiding in a depression in the earth, created by a large, fallen tree covered with fence rails. This was referred to locally as Nat Turner&#x27;s cave although it was not a natural cave. Around 1 p.m. on October 31, Turner arrived at the prison in the county seat of Jerusalem, Virginia (now Courtland).

== Trial and execution ==

Turner was tried on November 5, 1831, for &quot;conspiring to rebel and making insurrection&quot; and was convicted and sentenced to death. His attorney was James Strange French. Before his execution, he told his story to attorney Thomas R. Grey, who published &quot;The Confessions of Nat Turner&quot; in November 1831. James Trezvant served on the jury for Turner&#x27;s trial.

Asked if he regretted what he had done, Turner responded, &quot;Was Christ not crucified?&quot; Turner was hanged on November 11, 1831, in Jerusalem, Virginia. According to some sources, he was beheaded as an example to frighten other would-be rebels.

After his execution, Turner&#x27;s body was dissected and flayed, with his skin being used to make souvenir purses. In October 1897, Virginia newspapers ran a story about Nat Turner&#x27;s skeleton being used as a medical specimen by Dr. H. U. Stephenson of Toana, Virginia. Stephenson acquired the skeleton from a son of Dr. S. B. Kellar; Dr. Kellar claimed to have paid Turner $10 for his body while he was in jail. After the execution, Kellar had Turner&#x27;s bones scraped and hung as a medical specimen.

In 2002, a skull said to have been Turner&#x27;s was given to Richard G. Hatcher, the former mayor of Gary, Indiana, for the collection of a civil rights museum he planned to build there. In 2016, Hatcher returned the skull to two of Turner&#x27;s descendants. Since receiving the skull, the family has temporarily placed it with the Smithsonian Institution, where DNA testing will be done to determine whether it is the authentic remains of Nat Turner. If the test renders positive results, the family plans to bury his remains next to his descendants.

Another skull said to have been Turner&#x27;s was contributed to the College of Wooster in Ohio upon its incorporation in 1866. When the school&#x27;s only academic building burned down in 1901, the skull was saved by Dr. H. N. Mateer. Visitors recalled seeing a certificate, signed by a physician in Southampton County in 1866, that attested to the authenticity of the skull. The skull was eventually misplaced.

==Marriage and children==
Turner married an enslaved woman named Cherry, also spelled Chary (however, historians still dispute exactly who Nat Turner&#x27;s wife was). It is thought that Turner and Cherry met and were married at Samuel Turner&#x27;s plantation in the early 1820s. The couple had children; historians vary in believing that there were one, two, or three children (a daughter and possibly one or two sons, including one named Riddick). 

The family was separated after Samuel Turner died in 1823, when Turner was sold to Thomas Moore and his family were sold to Giles Reese. By 1831, his son was enslaved by Piety Reese and lived on a farm that was near the Travis farm where Turner was enslaved. However, in February 1831, Reese&#x27;s son John used Turner&#x27;s son as collateral for a family debt. One historian notes that Turner approached his conspirators for the rebellion days after his son was used as collateral.

After the rebellion, the authorities beat and tortured Cherry Turner in hopes of finding her husband. On September 26, 1831, the &quot;Richmond Constitutional Whig&quot; published a story about the raiding of Reese plantation stating that, &quot;some papers [were] given up by his wife, under the lash.&quot;

==Legacy==

<text>Gin Rummy, or simply Gin, is a two-player card game variant of Rummy. It has enjoyed widespread popularity as both a social and a gambling game, especially during the mid twentieth century, and remains today one of the most widely played two-player card games.

==History==
Gin Rummy was created in 1909 by Elwood T. Baker and his son C. Graham Baker. The game remained local to New York until 1941, when it was publicized throughout the United States after becoming a Hollywood fad. In 1947, a survey by an association of U.S. playing card manufacturers concluded that the number of people who learned Gin Rummy during World War II was equal to the number that learned to play pinochle, cribbage, poker, and bridge combined.

Magician and writer John Scarne believed Gin Rummy to have evolved from 19th-century whiskey poker (a game similar to Commerce, with players forming poker combinations) and to have been created with the intention of being faster than standard Rummy but less spontaneous than knock Rummy. Card game historian David Parlett finds Scarne&#x27;s theory to be &quot;highly implausible&quot;, and considers the game of Conquian to be Gin Rummy&#x27;s forerunner.

==Deck==
Gin Rummy is played using a standard deck of 52 cards. The ranking from high to low is King, Queen, Jack, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, Ace.

==Objective==
The objective in Gin Rummy is to be the first to reach an agreed-upon score, usually 100 points.

The basic game strategy is to improve one&#x27;s hand by &quot;melds&quot; and eliminating &quot;deadwood&quot;. Gin has two types of meld: &quot;Sets&quot; of three or four cards sharing the same rank, e.g. ; and &quot;runs&quot; or sequences of three or more cards in the same suit, such as or more. Deadwood cards are those not in any meld. Aces are considered low—they can form a set with other aces but only the low end of runs ( is a legal run but is not). A player can form any combination of melds within their hand; all sets, all runs, or some sets and some runs.

==Deal==
Dealership alternates from round to round, with the first dealer chosen by any agreed upon method. The dealer deals ten cards to each player one at a time starting with their opponent, and then places the next card in the deck face up. This begins the &quot;discard pile&quot;. The face down pile is known as the &quot;stock pile&quot;.

== Play ==
On the first turn of the round, the non-dealer has first option of taking the upcard on the discard pile or passing. If the non-dealer takes the upcard, they must then discard a different card to the discard pile. The player acting second can take the top card from the pile of their choice. However, if the non-dealer passes the upcard, the dealer is given the opportunity to take the upcard or pass. If the dealer also passes, the non-dealer must draw from the stock pile, then the next turn and after, players can draw from the pile of their choice.

On each subsequent turn, a player must draw either the (face-up) top card of the discard pile, or the (face-down) top card from the stock pile, and discard one card from their hand onto the discard pile. If a player chooses to draw face-up card (from the discard pile) the discarded card cannot be the just drawn card.

Players alternate taking turns until one player ends the round by declaring the hand over (&quot;knocking&quot;), or until only two cards remain in the stock pile, in which case the round ends in a draw and no points are awarded. The game ends when a player reaches 100 or more points (or another established amount). In tournament rules the game is played in best of five with 250 points per game.

===Knocking===
In standard Gin, a player with 10 or fewer points of deadwood may &quot;knock&quot;, immediately ending the hand without giving the opponent a chance to play. Knocking with no deadwood is known as &quot;going Gin&quot; or having a &quot;Gin hand&quot;, while knocking with deadwood points is known as &quot;going down&quot;.

When discarding to end a turn, a player who wishes to knock must clearly indicate their intent; this is generally shown by laying the discard face down, but can also be done through a verbal declaration or by tapping the playing surface. The player then lays out their hand, organized into melds and with any deadwood separated from them. The opponent, or &quot;defending&quot; player, shows their melds and is entitled to &quot;lay off&quot; any deadwood cards that fit into the knocking player&#x27;s melds, provided that the knocking player does not go Gin.

The &quot;deadwood count&quot; is the sum of the point values of the deadwood cards. Aces are scored at one point, face cards at 10, and others according to their numerical values. Intersecting melds are not allowed; if a player has a three-card set &quot;and&quot; a three-card run sharing a common card, only one of the melds counts, and the other two cards count as deadwood. For example; within the five cards , the seven of diamonds can be included in the set () or included in the run (), but it cannot be included in both.

For example, suppose that the knocking player has a meld of three Kings. If the defending player is holding the fourth King as deadwood, they may lay it off by adding it to the meld and thus reduce their deadwood count by 10. 

The difference in the two players&#x27; deadwood counts determines the score for the hand as follows.

* If the knocking player has the lower count, they score points equal to the difference.
* The defending player can &quot;undercut&quot; the knocking player by having a lower or equal count. In this case, the defending player scores the difference plus a bonus (usually 15 points). An undercut may occur either before or after the defending player has laid off any deadwood.

The knocking player can never lay off their deadwood into the defending player&#x27;s melds.

A player who goes Gin (i.e. has no deadwood) gets a bonus (typically 25 points).

===Big Gin===
A player holding a Gin hand may also choose to continue the round instead of revealing it, in hopes of attaining an 11-card &quot;Big Gin&quot; hand as follows.

If a player draws or takes a card that can be used to form melds with the 10 cards already held, the player declares Big Gin and the hand ends. That player scores a Big Gin bonus (typically 31 points) plus the defending player&#x27;s deadwood count; that player may not lay off any cards.

==Scoring==
Aces are scored at 1 point, face cards at 10, and all other cards are scored at their numerical values. The number of points awarded for bonuses may vary from region to region. No matter what the bonus amounts are.

; Knock points :After a player knocks, and the layoffs are made, the knocking player receives a score equal to the difference between the two hands. For example, if a player knocks with 8, and the defender has 10 deadwood points in their hand after laying off, the knocking player receives 2 points for the hand. If a player is able to knock before any cards are accepted, it is considered a misdeal.
; Gin bonus : After going Gin, a player receives a bonus of 25 points plus the entire count of deadwood in the opponent&#x27;s hand. There is no chance to lay off when a player goes Gin. In early official rules, the Gin bonus was 20 points.
; Undercut (or underknocking) : Occurs when the defending player has a deadwood count lower than or equal to that of the knocking player (this can occur either naturally or by laying off after a knock). In this case, the defender scores an undercut bonus of 25 points plus the difference in deadwood in the knocking player&#x27;s hand. In other rule sets, the bonus is 20. In early official rules, the bonus was only 10 points, and was not awarded in case of a tie.
; Game bonus :Once a player has acquired 100 points (200, 500 or some other agreed-upon number) the game is over, and that player receives a game bonus of 100 points.
; Line bonus or box bonus :In some variations, this is added at the end of the game. For every hand a player won during the game, 25 points is added to their score.
; Big Gin: Prior to knocking, if all 11 cards in a player&#x27;s hand form a legal Gin, the player can retain the extra card as part of their hand, and is awarded 31 points plus entire count of deadwood in their opponent&#x27;s hand. (In some rule sets players may be awarded 50 points or another established amount plus the entire count of deadwood in the opponent&#x27;s hand)
; Shutout bonus : If a game is completed with the winner having won every hand, the points for each hand are doubled before adding the line bonus.

In some variations, if a match ends with one player in the lead by exactly 50 points, that player automatically loses.

==Variations==

===Straight Gin===
In straight Gin, players are required to play until one of them can go Gin. Knocking is not allowed. Scoring and rules remain the same as standard Gin Rummy.

===Mahjong Gin===
Similar to straight Gin, knocking is not allowed. However, more than one card may be taken, in order, from the top of the discard pile. If more than one card is taken, the lowest position card taken must be used in a hand: e.g. &lt;bottom&gt; &lt;top of discard&gt; is the lowest position card and must be used in a hand; continue with one discard. Cards are shown to the table, with opponents being able to add on to straights of the same suit or finish a three of a kind with the fourth card for points. After a player has Gin, points are added, with cards on the table being added up and cards in hand being subtracted. The player who Gins receives 25 additional points, 2 through 9 = 5 points, 10 through K = 10 points, A = 15 points.

===Oklahoma Gin===
In this version of Gin Rummy, the value of the first upcard is used to determine the maximum count at which players can knock. If the upcard is a spade, the hand will count double. So if the first upcard was a 4, you can knock and go out with only 4 or fewer points in your hand; and if the card was , you would get double points that hand. In this variation it is possible to knock any of cards from the discard pile so as long as you put down a suit or pair.

Another version in this variation (mostly in match play) and in Hollywood Gin (see below), a second deck of cards will be used to determine the knock value of a hand. The knock value card will be dealt from the bottom and turned over on top. Above rules apply but both players are dealt ten cards with the last hand winner picking first from the deck.

===Hollywood Gin===
In the 1942 laws of Gin Rummy published in New York by Ely Culbertson&#x27;s Bridge World and prepared by a rules committee of bridge players, the scoring format for Hollywood Gin was published as a way to play &quot;simultaneous games&quot;. This is a scoring style, not a rules change to the game of Gin. 

In Hollywood Gin, scoring is kept for three different games at the same time. A player&#x27;s first win will be recorded in their column in Game One. A player&#x27;s second win will be recorded in their columns for both Game One and Game Two. Their third win will be recorded in their column for all three games. Every game after that is scored in all three columns after that Game 1, Game 2 &amp; Game 3. Once a game (column) is finished bonus are added to that game and hands are played until all three games are finished. Once all three games are finished the totals are added together for a total score. 

===Tedesco Gin===
Similar to Oklahoma Gin, except aces can be used high or low, and runs can be formed &quot;around the corner&quot; (such as ). If you are caught with an unmelded ace, it counts as 15 points against you. Hollywood scoring of three games to 200 when playing head-to-head or with two-person teams. Three-person teams play to 300, 25 points extra if all three teammates win. 50 points for four-person team, etc. This is a more complex Gin game for all levels of player.

===Single match===
When a single match is to be played, the players will continue to play rounds until one player has 100 points or more. This player wins the match.

===Multi-match===
In multi-match games, match scores are reset to zero with the start of each match, while game scores accumulate until a predetermined winning score is reached, perhaps 500 or higher. Each individual match ends when one player scores 100 match points. At the end of the match, players&#x27; match scores are credited toward their game scores, as well as:
*25 game points for each individual round won,
*100 game points to the winner of the match, and
*100 bonus game points to the match winner if the loser won no rounds.

==Notable players==
*Stu Ungar, widely regarded as the greatest Gin Rummy player of all time, was described by many as having a near clairvoyant ability to see his opponents&#x27; hands. Ungar&#x27;s almost total dominance of the game during the 1970s and 1980s is thought to have been a factor in the decline of Gin Rummy as a tournament game in Las Vegas and other gambling venues. (Ungar eventually switched to poker.)
*Oswald Jacoby, best known as a contract bridge and backgammon champion, also played high-stakes Gin Rummy and wrote several books on the game.
*Ernie Kovacs, the comedian and television pioneer, published a book in 1962 called &quot;How to Talk at Gin&quot;.
;Fictional characters
*The villain Auric Goldfinger cheats at Gin Rummy in the key introduction scene of the James Bond film &quot;Goldfinger&quot; (1964), with the help of an accomplice looking at the opponent&#x27;s cards through binoculars. The film script changed the game to Gin Rummy from two-handed Canasta in the source novel by Ian Fleming.

<text>Geophysics () is a subject of natural science concerned with the physical processes and physical properties of the Earth and its surrounding space environment, and the use of quantitative methods for their analysis. Geophysicists, who usually study geophysics, physics, or one of the Earth sciences at the graduate level, complete investigations across a wide range of scientific disciplines. The term &quot;geophysics&quot; classically refers to solid earth applications: Earth&#x27;s shape; its gravitational, magnetic fields, and electromagnetic fields ; its internal structure and composition; its dynamics and their surface expression in plate tectonics, the generation of magmas, volcanism and rock formation. However, modern geophysics organizations and pure scientists use a broader definition that includes the water cycle including snow and ice; fluid dynamics of the oceans and the atmosphere; electricity and magnetism in the ionosphere and magnetosphere and solar-terrestrial physics; and analogous problems associated with the Moon and other planets.

Although geophysics was only recognized as a separate discipline in the 19th century, its origins date back to ancient times. The first magnetic compasses were made from lodestones, while more modern magnetic compasses played an important role in the history of navigation. The first seismic instrument was built in 132 AD. Isaac Newton applied his theory of mechanics to the tides and the precession of the equinox; and instruments were developed to measure the Earth&#x27;s shape, density and gravity field, as well as the components of the water cycle. In the 20th century, geophysical methods were developed for remote exploration of the solid Earth and the ocean, and geophysics played an essential role in the development of the theory of plate tectonics.

Geophysics is applied to societal needs, such as mineral resources, mitigation of natural hazards and environmental protection. In exploration geophysics, geophysical survey data are used to analyze potential petroleum reservoirs and mineral deposits, locate groundwater, find archaeological relics, determine the thickness of glaciers and soils, and assess sites for environmental remediation.
== Physical phenomena ==
Geophysics is a highly interdisciplinary subject, and geophysicists contribute to every area of the Earth sciences, while some geophysicists conduct research in the planetary sciences. To provide a more clear idea on what constitutes geophysics, this section describes phenomena that are studied in physics and how they relate to the Earth and its surroundings. Geophysicists also investigate the physical processes and properties of the Earth, its fluid layers, and magnetic field along with the near-Earth environment in the Solar System, which includes other planetary bodies.

=== Gravity ===

The gravitational pull of the Moon and Sun gives rise to two high tides and two low tides every lunar day, or every 24 hours and 50 minutes. Therefore, there is a gap of 12 hours and 25 minutes between every high tide and between every low tide.

Gravitational forces make rocks press down on deeper rocks, increasing their density as the depth increases. Measurements of gravitational acceleration and gravitational potential at the Earth&#x27;s surface and above it can be used to look for mineral deposits (see gravity anomaly and gravimetry). The surface gravitational field provides information on the dynamics of tectonic plates. The geopotential surface called the geoid is one definition of the shape of the Earth. The geoid would be the global mean sea level if the oceans were in equilibrium and could be extended through the continents (such as with very narrow canals).

=== Heat flow ===
The Earth is cooling, and the resulting heat flow generates the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field through the geodynamo and plate tectonics through mantle convection. The main sources of heat are: primordial heat due to Earth&#x27;s cooling and radioactivity in the planets upper crust. There is also some contributions from phase transitions. Heat is mostly carried to the surface by thermal convection, although there are two thermal boundary layers – the core–mantle boundary and the lithosphere – in which heat is transported by conduction. Some heat is carried up from the bottom of the mantle by mantle plumes. The heat flow at the Earth&#x27;s surface is about , and it is a potential source of geothermal energy.

=== Vibrations ===
Seismic waves are vibrations that travel through the Earth&#x27;s interior or along its surface. The entire Earth can also oscillate in forms that are called normal modes or free oscillations of the Earth. Ground motions from waves or normal modes are measured using seismographs. If the waves come from a localized source such as an earthquake or explosion, measurements at more than one location can be used to locate the source. The locations of earthquakes provide information on plate tectonics and mantle convection.

Recording of seismic waves from controlled sources provides information on the region that the waves travel through. If the density or composition of the rock changes, waves are reflected. Reflections recorded using Reflection Seismology can provide a wealth of information on the structure of the earth up to several kilometers deep and are used to increase our understanding of the geology as well as to explore for oil and gas. Changes in the travel direction, called refraction, can be used to infer the deep structure of the Earth.

Earthquakes pose a risk to humans. Understanding their mechanisms, which depend on the type of earthquake (e.g., intraplate or deep focus), can lead to better estimates of earthquake risk and improvements in earthquake engineering.

=== Electricity ===
Although we mainly notice electricity during thunderstorms, there is always a downward electric field near the surface that averages 120 volts per meter. Relative to the solid Earth, the ionization of the planet&#x27;s atmosphere is a result of the galactic cosmic rays penetrating it, which leaves it with a net positive charge. A current of about 1800 amperes flows in the global circuit. It flows downward from the ionosphere over most of the Earth and back upwards through thunderstorms. The flow is manifested by lightning below the clouds and sprites above.

A variety of electric methods are used in geophysical survey. Some measure spontaneous potential, a potential that arises in the ground because of human-made or natural disturbances. Telluric currents flow in Earth and the oceans. They have two causes: electromagnetic induction by the time-varying, external-origin geomagnetic field and motion of conducting bodies (such as seawater) across the Earth&#x27;s permanent magnetic field. The distribution of telluric current density can be used to detect variations in electrical resistivity of underground structures. Geophysicists can also provide the electric current themselves (see induced polarization and electrical resistivity tomography).

=== Electromagnetic waves ===

Electromagnetic waves occur in the ionosphere and magnetosphere as well as in Earth&#x27;s outer core. Dawn chorus is believed to be caused by high-energy electrons that get caught in the Van Allen radiation belt. Whistlers are produced by lightning strikes. Hiss may be generated by both. Electromagnetic waves may also be generated by earthquakes (see seismo-electromagnetics).

In the highly conductive liquid iron of the outer core, magnetic fields are generated by electric currents through electromagnetic induction. Alfvén waves are magnetohydrodynamic waves in the magnetosphere or the Earth&#x27;s core. In the core, they probably have little observable effect on the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field, but slower waves such as magnetic Rossby waves may be one source of geomagnetic secular variation.

Electromagnetic methods that are used for geophysical survey include transient electromagnetics, magnetotellurics, surface nuclear magnetic resonance and electromagnetic seabed logging.

=== Magnetism ===

The Earth&#x27;s magnetic field protects the Earth from the deadly solar wind and has long been used for navigation. It originates in the fluid motions of the outer core. The magnetic field in the upper atmosphere gives rise to the auroras.
The Earth&#x27;s field is roughly like a tilted dipole, but it changes over time (a phenomenon called geomagnetic secular variation). Mostly the geomagnetic pole stays near the geographic pole, but at random intervals averaging 440,000 to a million years or so, the polarity of the Earth&#x27;s field reverses. These geomagnetic reversals, analyzed within a Geomagnetic Polarity Time Scale, contain 184 polarity intervals in the last 83 million years, with change in frequency over time, with the most recent brief complete reversal of the Laschamp event occurring 41,000 years ago during the last glacial period. Geologists observed geomagnetic reversal recorded in volcanic rocks, through magnetostratigraphy correlation (see natural remanent magnetization) and their signature can be seen as parallel linear magnetic anomaly stripes on the seafloor. These stripes provide quantitative information on seafloor spreading, a part of plate tectonics. They are the basis of magnetostratigraphy, which correlates magnetic reversals with other stratigraphies to construct geologic time scales. In addition, the magnetization in rocks can be used to measure the motion of continents.

=== Radioactivity ===
Radioactive decay accounts for about 80% of the Earth&#x27;s internal heat, powering the geodynamo and plate tectonics. The main heat-producing isotopes are potassium-40, uranium-238, uranium-235, and thorium-232.
Radioactive elements are used for radiometric dating, the primary method for establishing an absolute time scale in geochronology.

Unstable isotopes decay at predictable rates, and the decay rates of different isotopes cover several orders of magnitude, so radioactive decay can be used to accurately date both recent events and events in past geologic eras. Radiometric mapping using ground and airborne gamma spectrometry can be used to map the concentration and distribution of radioisotopes near the Earth&#x27;s surface, which is useful for mapping lithology and alteration.

=== Fluid dynamics ===

Fluid motions occur in the magnetosphere, atmosphere, ocean, mantle and core. Even the mantle, though it has an enormous viscosity, flows like a fluid over long time intervals. This flow is reflected in phenomena such as isostasy, post-glacial rebound and mantle plumes. The mantle flow drives plate tectonics and the flow in the Earth&#x27;s core drives the geodynamo.

Geophysical fluid dynamics is a primary tool in physical oceanography and meteorology. The rotation of the Earth has profound effects on the Earth&#x27;s fluid dynamics, often due to the Coriolis effect. In the atmosphere, it gives rise to large-scale patterns like Rossby waves and determines the basic circulation patterns of storms. In the ocean, they drive large-scale circulation patterns as well as Kelvin waves and Ekman spirals at the ocean surface. In the Earth&#x27;s core, the circulation of the molten iron is structured by Taylor columns.

Waves and other phenomena in the magnetosphere can be modeled using magnetohydrodynamics.

=== Mineral physics ===

The physical properties of minerals must be understood to infer the composition of the Earth&#x27;s interior from seismology, the geothermal gradient and other sources of information. Mineral physicists study the elastic properties of minerals; their high-pressure phase diagrams, melting points and equations of state at high pressure; and the rheological properties of rocks, or their ability to flow. Deformation of rocks by creep make flow possible, although over short times the rocks are brittle. The viscosity of rocks is affected by temperature and pressure, and in turn, determines the rates at which tectonic plates move.

Water is a very complex substance and its unique properties are essential for life. Its physical properties shape the hydrosphere and are an essential part of the water cycle and climate. Its thermodynamic properties determine evaporation and the thermal gradient in the atmosphere. The many types of precipitation involve a complex mixture of processes such as coalescence, supercooling and supersaturation. Some precipitated water becomes groundwater, and groundwater flow includes phenomena such as percolation, while the conductivity of water makes electrical and electromagnetic methods useful for tracking groundwater flow. Physical properties of water such as salinity have a large effect on its motion in the oceans.

The many phases of ice form the cryosphere and come in forms like ice sheets, glaciers, sea ice, freshwater ice, snow, and frozen ground (or permafrost).

== Regions of the Earth ==

=== Size and form of the Earth ===
Contrary to popular belief, the earth is not entirely spherical but instead generally exhibits an ellipsoid shape- which is a result of the centrifugal forces the planet generates due to its constant motion. These forces cause the planets diameter to bulge towards the Equator and results in the ellipsoid shape. Earth&#x27;s shape is constantly changing, and different factors including glacial isostatic rebound (large ice sheets melting causing the Earth&#x27;s crust to the rebound due to the release of the pressure), geological features such as mountains or ocean trenches, tectonic plate dynamics, and natural disasters can further distort the planet&#x27;s shape.

=== Structure of the interior ===
Evidence from seismology, heat flow at the surface, and mineral physics is combined with the Earth&#x27;s mass and moment of inertia to infer models of the Earth&#x27;s interior – its composition, density, temperature, pressure. For example, the Earth&#x27;s mean specific gravity () is far higher than the typical specific gravity of rocks at the surface (), implying that the deeper material is denser. This is also implied by its low moment of inertia (, compared to for a sphere of constant density). However, some of the density increase is compression under the enormous pressures inside the Earth. The effect of pressure can be calculated using the Adams–Williamson equation. The conclusion is that pressure alone cannot account for the increase in density. Instead, we know that the Earth&#x27;s core is composed of an alloy of iron and other minerals.

Reconstructions of seismic waves in the deep interior of the Earth show that there are no S-waves in the outer core. This indicates that the outer core is liquid, because liquids cannot support shear. The outer core is liquid, and the motion of this highly conductive fluid generates the Earth&#x27;s field. Earth&#x27;s inner core, however, is solid because of the enormous pressure.

Reconstruction of seismic reflections in the deep interior indicates some major discontinuities in seismic velocities that demarcate the major zones of the Earth: inner core, outer core, mantle, lithosphere and crust. The mantle itself is divided into the upper mantle, transition zone, lower mantle and &quot;D′′&quot; layer. Between the crust and the mantle is the Mohorovičić discontinuity.

The seismic model of the Earth does not by itself determine the composition of the layers. For a complete model of the Earth, mineral physics is needed to interpret seismic velocities in terms of composition. The mineral properties are temperature-dependent, so the geotherm must also be determined. This requires physical theory for thermal conduction and convection and the heat contribution of radioactive elements. The main model for the radial structure of the interior of the Earth is the preliminary reference Earth model (PREM). Some parts of this model have been updated by recent findings in mineral physics (see post-perovskite) and supplemented by seismic tomography. The mantle is mainly composed of silicates, and the boundaries between layers of the mantle are consistent with phase transitions.

The mantle acts as a solid for seismic waves, but under high pressures and temperatures, it deforms so that over millions of years it acts like a liquid. This makes plate tectonics possible.

=== Magnetosphere ===
If a planet&#x27;s magnetic field is strong enough, its interaction with the solar wind forms a magnetosphere. Early space probes mapped out the gross dimensions of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field, which extends about 10 Earth radii towards the Sun. The solar wind, a stream of charged particles, streams out and around the terrestrial magnetic field, and continues behind the magnetic tail, hundreds of Earth radii downstream. Inside the magnetosphere, there are relatively dense regions of solar wind particles called the Van Allen radiation belts.

== Methods ==

===Geodesy===
Geophysical measurements are generally at a particular time and place. Accurate measurements of position, along with earth deformation and gravity, are the province of geodesy. While geodesy and geophysics are separate fields, the two are so closely connected that many scientific organizations such as the American Geophysical Union, the Canadian Geophysical Union and the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics encompass both.

Absolute positions are most frequently determined using the global positioning system (GPS). A three-dimensional position is calculated using messages from four or more visible satellites and referred to the 1980 Geodetic Reference System. An alternative, optical astronomy, combines astronomical coordinates and the local gravity vector to get geodetic coordinates. This method only provides the position in two coordinates and is more difficult to use than GPS. However, it is useful for measuring motions of the Earth such as nutation and Chandler wobble. Relative positions of two or more points can be determined using very-long-baseline interferometry.

Gravity measurements became part of geodesy because they were needed to related measurements at the surface of the Earth to the reference coordinate system. Gravity measurements on land can be made using gravimeters deployed either on the surface or in helicopter flyovers. Since the 1960s, the Earth&#x27;s gravity field has been measured by analyzing the motion of satellites. Sea level can also be measured by satellites using radar altimetry, contributing to a more accurate geoid. In 2002, NASA launched the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), wherein two twin satellites map variations in Earth&#x27;s gravity field by making measurements of the distance between the two satellites using GPS and a microwave ranging system. Gravity variations detected by GRACE include those caused by changes in ocean currents; runoff and ground water depletion; melting ice sheets and glaciers.

===Satellites and space probes===
Satellites in space have made it possible to collect data from not only the visible light region, but in other areas of the electromagnetic spectrum. The planets can be characterized by their force fields: gravity and their magnetic fields, which are studied through geophysics and space physics.

Measuring the changes in acceleration experienced by spacecraft as they orbit has allowed fine details of the gravity fields of the planets to be mapped. For example, in the 1970s, the gravity field disturbances above lunar maria were measured through lunar orbiters, which led to the discovery of concentrations of mass, mascons, beneath the Imbrium, Serenitatis, Crisium, Nectaris and Humorum basins.

=== Global positioning systems (GPS) and geographical information systems (GIS) ===

Since geophysics is concerned with the shape of the Earth, and by extension the mapping of features around and in the planet, geophysical measurements include high accuracy GPS measurements. These measurements are processed to increase their accuracy through differential GPS processing. Once the geophysical measurements have been processed and inverted, the interpreted results are plotted using GIS. Programs such as ArcGIS and Geosoft were built to meet these needs and include many geophysical functions that are built-in, such as upward continuation, and the calculation of the measurement derivative such as the first-vertical derivative. Many geophysics companies have designed in-house geophysics programs that pre-date ArcGIS and GeoSoft in order to meet the visualization requirements of a geophysical dataset.

=== Remote sensing ===

Exploration geophysics is a branch of applied geophysics that involves the development and utilization of different seismic or electromagnetic methods which the aim of investigating different energy, mineral and water resources. This is done through the uses of various remote sensing platforms such as; satellites, aircraft, boats, drones, borehole sensing equipment and seismic receivers. These equipment are often used in conjunction with different geophysical methods such as magnetic, gravimetry, electromagnetic, radiometric, barometry methods in order to gather the data. The remote sensing platforms used in exploration geophysics are not perfect and need adjustments done on them in order to accurately account for the effects that the platform itself may have on the collected data. For example, when gathering aeromagnetic data (aircraft gathered magnetic data) using a conventional fixed-wing aircraft- the platform has to be adjusted to account for the electromagnetic currents that it may generate as it passes through Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. There are also corrections related to changes in measured potential field intensity as the Earth rotates, as the Earth orbits the Sun, and as the moon orbits the Earth.

=== Signal processing ===

Geophysical measurements are often recorded as time-series with GPS location. Signal processing involves the correction of time-series data for unwanted noise or errors introduced by the measurement platform, such as aircraft vibrations in gravity data. It also involves the reduction of sources of noise, such as diurnal corrections in magnetic data. In seismic data, electromagnetic data, and gravity data, processing continues after error corrections to include computational geophysics which result in the final interpretation of the geophysical data into a geological interpretation of the geophysical measurements

== History ==

Geophysics emerged as a separate discipline only in the 19th century, from the intersection of physical geography, geology, astronomy, meteorology, and physics. The first known use of the word &quot;geophysics&quot; was in German (&quot;Geophysik&quot;) by Julius Fröbel in 1834. However, many geophysical phenomena – such as the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field and earthquakes – have been investigated since the ancient era.

=== Ancient and classical eras ===

The magnetic compass existed in China back as far as the fourth century BC. It was used as much for feng shui as for navigation on land. It was not until good steel needles could be forged that compasses were used for navigation at sea; before that, they could not retain their magnetism long enough to be useful. The first mention of a compass in Europe was in 1190 AD.

In circa 240 BC, Eratosthenes of Cyrene deduced that the Earth was round and measured the circumference of Earth with great precision. He developed a system of latitude and longitude.

Perhaps the earliest contribution to seismology was the invention of a seismoscope by the prolific inventor Zhang Heng in 132 AD. This instrument was designed to drop a bronze ball from the mouth of a dragon into the mouth of a toad. By looking at which of eight toads had the ball, one could determine the direction of the earthquake. It was 1571 years before the first design for a seismoscope was published in Europe, by Jean de la Hautefeuille. It was never built.

=== Beginnings of modern science ===
The 17th century had major milestones that marked the beginning of modern science. In 1600, William Gilbert release a publication titled &quot;De Magnete&quot; (1600) where he conducted series of experiments on both natural magnets (called &#x27;loadstones&#x27;) and artificially magnetized iron. His experiments lead to observations involving a small compass needle (versorium) which replicated magnetic behaviours when subjected to a spherical magnet, along with it experiencing &#x27;magnetic dips&#x27; when it was pivoted on a horizontal axis. HIs findings led to the deduction that compasses point north due to the Earth itself being a giant magnet.

In 1687 Isaac Newton published his work titled &quot;Principia&quot; which was pivotal in the development of modern scientific fields such as astronomy and physics. In it, Newton both laid the foundations for classical mechanics and gravitation, as well as explained different geophysical phenomena such as the precession of the equinox (the orbit of whole star patterns along an ecliptic axis. Newton&#x27;s theory of gravity had gained so much success, that it resulted in changing the main objective of physics in that era to unravel natures fundamental forces, and their characterizations in laws.

The first seismometer, an instrument capable of keeping a continuous record of seismic activity, was built by James Forbes in 1844.

<text>A snail is a shelled gastropod. The name is most often applied to land snails, terrestrial pulmonate gastropod molluscs. However, the common name &quot;snail&quot; is also used for most of the members of the molluscan class Gastropoda that have a coiled shell that is large enough for the animal to retract completely into. When the word &quot;snail&quot; is used in this most general sense, it includes not just land snails but also numerous species of sea snails and freshwater snails. Gastropods that naturally lack a shell, or have only an internal shell, are mostly called &quot;slugs&quot;, and land snails that have only a very small shell (that they cannot retract into) are often called &quot;semi-slugs&quot;.

Snails have considerable human relevance, including as food items, as pests, and as vectors of disease, and their shells are used as decorative objects and are incorporated into jewellery. The snail has also had some cultural significance, tending to be associated with lethargy. The snail has also been used as a figure of speech in reference to slow-moving things.

==Overview==
Snails that respire using a lung belong to the group Pulmonata. As traditionally defined, the Pulmonata were found to be polyphyletic in a molecular study per Jörger &quot;et al.&quot;, dating from 2010. But snails with gills also form a polyphyletic group; in other words, snails with lungs and snails with gills form a number of taxonomic groups that are not necessarily more closely related to each other than they are related to some other groups.

Both snails that have lungs and snails that have gills have diversified so widely over geological time that a few species with gills can be found on land and numerous species with lungs can be found in freshwater. Even a few marine species have lungs.

Snails can be found in a very wide range of environments, including ditches, deserts, and the abyssal depths of the sea. Although land snails may be more familiar to laymen, marine snails constitute the majority of snail species, and have much greater diversity and a greater biomass. Numerous kinds of snail can also be found in fresh water.

Most snails have thousands of microscopic tooth-like structures located on a banded ribbon-like tongue called a radula. The radula works like a file, ripping food into small pieces. Many snails are herbivorous, eating plants or rasping algae from surfaces with their radulae, though a few land species and many marine species are omnivores or predatory carnivores. Snails cannot absorb colored pigments when eating paper or cardboard so their feces are also colored.

Several species of the genus &quot;Achatina&quot; and related genera are known as giant African land snails; some grow to from snout to tail, and weigh . The largest living species of sea snail is &quot;Syrinx aruanus&quot;; its shell can measure up to in length, and the whole animal with the shell can weigh up to . The smallest land snail, &quot;Angustopila psammion,&quot; was discovered in 2022 and measures 0.6 mm in diameter.

The largest known land gastropod is the African giant snail &quot;Achatina achatina&quot;, the largest recorded specimen of which measured from snout to tail when fully extended, with a shell length of in December 1978. It weighed exactly 900 g (about 2 lb). Named Gee Geronimo, this snail was owned by Christopher Hudson (1955–79) of Hove, East Sussex, UK, and was collected in Sierra Leone in June 1976.

Snails are protostomes. That means during development, in the gastrulation phase, the blastopore forms the mouth first. Cleavage in snails is spiral holoblastic patterning. In spiral holoblastic cleavage, the cleavage plane rotates each division and the cell divisions are complete. Snails do not undergo metamorphosis after hatching. Snails hatch in the form of small adults. The only additional development they will undergo is to consume calcium to strengthen their shell. Snails can be male, female, hermaphroditic, or parthenogenetic so there are many different systems of sexual determination.

== Anatomy ==
Snails have complex organ systems and anatomies that differ greatly from most animals. Snails and most other Mollusca share three anatomical features; the foot, the mantle, and the radula.

Foot: The foot is a muscular organ used by Gastropods for locomotion. Gastropods&#x27; stomachs are located within their foot. Both land and sea snails travel by contracting foot muscles to deform the mucus layer beneath it into different wave-like patterns.

Mantle: The mantle is the organ that produces shells for most species of mollusca. In snails, the mantle secretes the shell along the snail shell opening, continuously growing and producing the shell for the entirety of the snail’s life. The mantle creates a compartment known as the mantle cavity and is used by many mollusca as the surface where gas exchange occurs. Snails that use the mantle cavity as a lung are known as Pulmonate snails. Other snails may only have a gill. Snails in the Caenogastropoda families like Ampullariidae, have both a gill and a lung.

Shell: Snail shells are mainly composed of a mixture of proteins called conchin, and calcium carbonate. Conchin is the main component in the outer layer of the shell, known as the periostracum. The inner layers of the shell are composed of a network of calcium carbonate, conchin, and different mineral salts. The mantle produces the shell through addition around a central axis called the columella, causing a spiraling pattern. The spiraling patterns on a snail’s shell are known as coils or whorls. Whorl size generally increases as the snail ages. Size differences in shell size are believed to be mainly influenced by genetic and environmental components. Moister conditions often correlate with larger snails. In larger populations, adult snails attain smaller shell sizes due to the effects of pheromones on growth rate.

Radula: The radula is an anatomical structure used by most species of Mollusca for feeding. Gastropods are morphologically highly variable and have diverse feeding strategies. Snails can be herbivores, detritivores, scavengers, parasites, ciliary feeders, or have highly specialized predation. Nearly all snails utilize a feeding apparatus including the oral structures of one or more jaws and the radula. The radula comprises a chitinous ribbon with teeth arranged in transverse and longitudinal rows. The radula continually renews itself during the entire lifespan of a mollusk. The teeth and membrane are continuously synthesized in the radular sac and then shifted forward towards the working zone of the radula. The teeth harden and mineralize during their travel to the working zone. The presence of the radula is common throughout most snail species, but often differs in many characteristics, like the shape, size, and number of odontoblasts that form a tooth.

==Diet==

The average snail&#x27;s diet varies greatly depending on the species, including different feeding styles from herbivores to highly specialized feeders and parasites. Some snails like the Euglandina rosea, or rosy wolfsnail, are carnivorous and prey on other snails. However, most land snails are herbivores or omnivores. Among land snails, there is also a large variation in preference for specific food. For example, &quot;Cepaea nemoralis&quot;, or the grove snail, prefers dead plant material over fresh herbs or grasses. Age may also impact food preference, with adult grove snails showing a significantly larger preference for dead plant material than juvenile grove snails. Other snails, like the generalist herbivore &quot;Arianta arbustorum&quot;, or copse snail, choose their meals based on availability, consuming a mix of arthropods, wilted flowers, fresh and decayed plant material, and soil.

Generally, land snails are most active at night due to the damp weather. The humid nighttime air minimizes water evaporation and is beneficial to land snails because their movement requires mucus, which is mostly composed of water. In addition to aiding movement, mucus plays a vital role in transporting food from the gill to the mouth, cleansing the mantle cavity, and trapping food before ingestion.

==Types of snails by habitat==
==Slugs==

Gastropods that lack a conspicuous shell are commonly called slugs rather than snails. Some species of slug have a maroon-brown shell, some have only an internal vestige that serves mainly as a calcium lactate repository, and others have some to no shell at all. Other than that there is little morphological difference between slugs and snails. There are however important differences in habitats and behavior.

A shell-less animal is much more maneuverable and compressible, so even quite large land slugs can take advantage of habitats or retreats with very little space, retreats that would be inaccessible to a similar-sized snail. Slugs squeeze themselves into confined spaces such as under loose bark on trees or under stone slabs, logs or wooden boards lying on the ground. In such retreats they are in less danger from either predators or desiccation. Those are often suitable places for laying their eggs.

Slugs as a group are far from monophyletic; scientifically speaking &quot;slug&quot; is a term of convenience with little taxonomic significance. The reduction or loss of the shell has evolved many times independently within several very different lineages of gastropods. The various taxa of land and sea gastropods with slug morphology occur within numerous higher taxonomic groups of shelled species; such independent slug taxa are not in general closely related to one another.

==Parasitic diseases==
Snails can also be associated with parasitic diseases such as schistosomiasis, angiostrongyliasis, fasciolopsiasis, opisthorchiasis, fascioliasis, paragonimiasis and clonorchiasis, which can be transmitted to humans.

==Human relevance==
Land snails are known as an agricultural and garden pest but some species are an edible delicacy and occasionally household pets. In addition, their mucus can also be used for skin care products.

===In agriculture===
There is a variety of snail-control measures that gardeners and farmers use in an attempt to reduce damage to valuable plants. Traditional pesticides are still used, as are many less toxic control options such as concentrated garlic or wormwood solutions. Copper metal is also a snail repellent, and thus a copper band around the trunk of a tree will prevent snails from climbing up and reaching the foliage and fruit. A layer of a dry, finely ground, and scratchy substance such as diatomaceous earth can also deter snails.

The decollate snail (&quot;Rumina decollata&quot;) will capture and eat garden snails, and because of this it has sometimes been introduced as a biological pest control agent. However, this is not without problems, as the decollate snail is just as likely to attack and devour other gastropods that may represent a valuable part of the native fauna of the region.
===Textiles===
Certain varieties of snails, notably the family Muricidae, produce a secretion that is a color-fast natural dye. The ancient Tyrian purple was made in this way as were other purple and blue dyes. The extreme expense of extracting this secretion is sufficient quantities limited its use to the very wealthy. It is such dyes as these that led to certain shades of purple and blue being associated with royalty and wealth.

=== As pets ===
Throughout history, snails have been kept as pets. There are many famous snails such as Lefty (Born Jeremy) and within fiction, Gary and Brian the snail.

===Culinary use===

In French cuisine, edible snails are served for instance in &quot;Escargot à la Bourguignonne&quot;. The practice of rearing snails for food is known as heliciculture. For purposes of cultivation, the snails are kept in a dark place in a wired cage with dry straw or dry wood. Coppiced wine-grape vines are often used for this purpose. During the rainy period, the snails come out of hibernation and release most of their mucus onto the dry wood/straw. The snails are then prepared for cooking. Their texture when cooked is slightly chewy and tender.

As well as being eaten as gourmet food, several species of land snails provide an easily harvested source of protein to many people in poor communities around the world. Many land snails are valuable because they can feed on a wide range of agricultural wastes, such as shed leaves in banana plantations. In some countries, giant African land snails are produced commercially for food.

Land snails, freshwater snails and sea snails are all eaten in many countries. In certain parts of the world snails are fried. For example, in Indonesia, they are fried as satay, a dish known as &quot;sate kakul&quot;. The eggs of certain snail species are eaten in a fashion similar to the way caviar is eaten.

In Bulgaria, snails are traditionally cooked in an oven with rice or fried in a pan with vegetable oil and red paprika powder. Before they are used for those dishes, however, they are thoroughly boiled in hot water (for up to 90 minutes) and manually extracted from their shells. The two species most commonly used for food in the country are &quot;Helix lucorum&quot; and &quot;Helix pomatia&quot;.

Snails and slug species that are not normally eaten in certain areas have occasionally been used as famine food in historical times. A history of Scotland written in the 1800s recounts a description of various snails and their use as food items in times of plague.

===Cultural depictions===
Because of its slowness, the snail has traditionally been seen as a symbol of laziness. In Christian culture, it has been used as a symbol of the deadly sin of sloth. In Mayan mythology, the snail is associated with sexual desire, being personified by the god Uayeb.

Snails were widely noted and used in divination. The Greek poet Hesiod wrote that snails signified the time to harvest by climbing the stalks, while the Aztec moon god Tecciztecatl bore a snail shell on his back. This symbolised rebirth; the snail&#x27;s penchant for appearing and disappearing was analogised with the moon.

Keong Emas (Javanese and Indonesian for Golden Snail) is a popular Javanese folklore about a princess magically transformed and contained in a golden snail shell. The folklore is a part of popular Javanese Panji cycle telling the stories about the prince Panji Asmoro Bangun (also known as Raden Inu Kertapati) and his consort, princess Dewi Sekartaji (also known as Dewi Chandra Kirana).

In contemporary speech, the expression &quot;a snail&#x27;s pace&quot; is often used to describe a slow, inefficient process. The phrase &quot;snail mail&quot; is used to mean regular postal service delivery of paper messages as opposed to the delivery of email, which can be virtually instantaneous.

<text>The Treaty of Nanking was the peace treaty which ended the First Opium War (1839–1842) between Great Britain and the Qing dynasty of China on 29 August 1842. It was the first of what the Chinese later termed the &quot;unequal treaties&quot;.

In the wake of China&#x27;s military defeat, with British warships poised to attack Nanjing (then romanized as Nanking), British and Chinese officials negotiated on board HMS &quot;Cornwallis&quot; anchored in the Yangtze at the city. On 29 August, British representative Sir Henry Pottinger and Qing representatives Keying, Yilibu, and signed the treaty, which consisted of thirteen articles. 

The treaty was ratified by the Daoguang Emperor on 27 October and Queen Victoria on 28 December. The exchange of ratification took place in Hong Kong on 26 June 1843. The treaty required the Chinese to pay an indemnity, to cede the Island of Hong Kong to the British as a colony, to essentially end the Canton system that had limited trade to that port and allow trade at Five Treaty Ports. It was followed in 1843 by the Treaty of the Bogue, which granted extraterritoriality and most favoured nation status.

==Background==

In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Britain faced a growing trade deficit with China. Britain could offer nothing to China to match the growing importation of Chinese goods to Britain, such as tea and porcelain. In British India, opium was grown on plantations and auctioned to merchants, who then sold it to Chinese who smuggled it into China (Chinese law forbade the importation and sale of opium). When Lin Zexu seized this privately owned opium and ordered the destruction of opium at Humen, Britain first demanded reparations, then declared what became known as the First Opium War. Britain&#x27;s use of recently invented military technology produced a crushing victory and allowed it to impose a one-sided treaty. 

The first working draft for articles of a treaty was prepared at the Foreign Office in London in February 1840. The Foreign Office was aware that preparing a treaty containing Chinese and English characters would need special consideration. Given the distance separating the countries, the parties realised that some flexibility and a departure from established procedure in preparing treaties might be required.

==Terms==

===Foreign trade===
The fundamental purpose of the treaty was to change the framework of foreign trade imposed by the Canton System, which had been in force since 1760. Under Article V, the treaty abolished the former monopoly of the &quot;Cohong&quot; and their Thirteen Factories in Canton. Four additional &quot;treaty ports&quot; opened for foreign trade alongside Canton (Shameen Island from 1859 until 1943): Xiamen (or Amoy; until 1930), Fuzhou, Ningbo and Shanghai (until 1943), where foreign merchants were to be allowed to trade with anyone they wished. Britain also gained the right to send consuls to the treaty ports, which were given the right to communicate directly with local Chinese officials (Article II). The treaty stipulated that trade in the treaty ports should be subject to fixed tariffs, which were to be agreed upon between the British and the Qing governments (Article X).

===Reparations and demobilisation===

The Qing government was obliged to pay the British government 6 million silver dollars for the opium that had been confiscated by Lin Zexu in 1839 (Article IV), 3 million dollars in compensation for debts that the merchants in Canton owed British merchants (Article V), and a further 12 million dollars in war reparations for the cost of the war (Article VI). The total sum of 21 million dollars was to be paid in instalments over three years and the Qing government would be charged an annual interest rate of 5 percent for the money that was not paid in a timely manner (Article VII).

The Qing government undertook to release all British prisoners of war (Article VIII), and to give a general amnesty to all Chinese subjects who had cooperated with the British during the war (Article IX).

The British on their part, undertook to withdraw all of their troops from Nanjing, the Grand Canal and the military post at Zhenhai, as well as not to interfere with China trade generally, after the emperor had given his assent to the treaty and the first instalment of money had been received (Article XII). British troops would remain in Gulangyu and Zhaobaoshan until the Qing government had paid reparations in full (Article XII).

===Cession of Hong Kong===

In 1841, a rough outline for a treaty was sent for the guidance of Plenipotentiary Charles Elliot. It had a blank after the words &quot;the cession of the &quot;islands&quot; of&quot;. Pottinger sent this old draft treaty on shore, with the letter &quot;s&quot; struck out of &quot;islands&quot; and the words &quot;Hong Kong&quot; placed after it. Robert Montgomery Martin, treasurer of Hong Kong, wrote in an official report:
The terms of peace having been read, Elepoo the senior commissioner paused, expecting something more, and at length said &quot;is that all?&quot; Mr. Morrison enquired of Lieutenant-colonel Malcolm [Pottinger&#x27;s secretary] if there was anything else, and being answered in the negative, Elepoo immediately and with great tact closed the negotiation by saying, &quot;&quot;all shall be granted—it is settled—it is finished&quot;.&quot;
The Qing government agreed to make Hong Kong Island a crown colony, ceding it to the Queen Victoria of Great Britain, in perpetuity (, &quot;Cháng yuǎn&quot;, in the Chinese version of the treaty), to provide British traders with a harbour where they could &quot;careen and refit their ships and keep stores for that purpose&quot; (Article III). Pottinger was later appointed the first Governor of Hong Kong.

In 1860, the colony was extended with the addition of the Kowloon peninsula under the Convention of Peking and in 1898, the Second Convention of Peking further expanded the colony with the 99-year lease of the New Territories. In 1984, the governments of the United Kingdom and the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) concluded the Sino-British Joint Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong, under which the sovereignty of the leased territories, together with Hong Kong Island and Kowloon (south of Boundary Street) ceded under the Convention of Peking (1860), was transferred to the PRC on 1 July 1997.

==Aftermath==

The treaty was sealed by interpreter John Robert Morrison for the British and Wang Tajin for the Chinese. Harry Parkes, who was a student of Chinese under Morrison, gave his account of the ceremony:
There were four copies of the Treaty signed and sealed. They were bound in worked yellow silk, one Treaty in English and the same in Chinese stitched and bound together formed a copy. This being finished they all came out of the after-cabin and sat down to tiffin, and the different officers seated themselves all round the table, making plenty of guests. Almost directly after the Treaty was signed, a yellow flag for China at the main and a Union Jack for England at the mizen were hoisted, and at the same time a royal salute of twenty-one guns was fired.
The Daoguang Emperor gave his assent for the treaty on 8 September. After his assent arrived in Nanjing on 15 September, Pottinger&#x27;s secretary George Alexander Malcolm was dispatched on board the steamer &quot;Auckland&quot; the next morning to the Court of St James&#x27;s with a copy for ratification by Queen Victoria. The emperor ratified the treaty on 27 October and Queen Victoria added her written assent on 28 December. Ratification was exchanged in Hong Kong on 26 June 1843. 

Pottinger wrote in a letter to the Earl of Aberdeen the following year that at a feast with Keying celebrating the ratification, Keying insisted they ceremonially exchange miniature portraits of each member of each other&#x27;s families. Upon receiving a miniature portrait of Pottinger&#x27;s wife, Pottinger wrote that Keying &quot;placed [the miniature] on his head—which I am told is the highest token of respect and friendship—filled a glass of wine, held the picture in front of his face, muttered some words in a low voice, drank the wine, again placed the picture on his head and then sat down&quot; to complete the ceremony of long-term amity between the two families and the two peoples. This extravagant display has been analysed as showing an &quot;erotically charged ... reciprocity [in] this symbolic gesture of swapping images of wives.

Because of the brevity of the Treaty of Nanking and its terms being phrased only as general stipulations, the British and Chinese representatives agreed that a supplementary treaty should be concluded to establish more detailed regulations for relations. On 3October 1843, the parties concluded the supplementary Treaty of the Bogue at the Bocca Tigris outside Canton.

Nevertheless, the treaties of 1842–43 left several unsettled issues. In particular they did not resolve the status of the opium traffic in favour of the British Empire. Although the Treaty of Wanghia with the Americans in 1844 explicitly banned Americans from selling opium, the trade continued as both the British and American merchants were only subject to the legal control of their permissive consuls. The opium traffic was later legalised in the Treaties of Tianjin, which China concluded after the Second Opium War resulted in another defeat for the Qing dynasty.

The Treaty itself contained no provision for the legalization of the opium trade. Stephen R. Platt writes that such a term would have provided the opponents of Lord Palmerston, who headed the Conservative government that launched the war, with a seeming confirmation for their claim that the war was fought to support the opium trade. Instead, Palmerston asked his negotiators to request the Chinese to legalize the sale of opium on their own initiative, outside of the treaty’s terms, which they refused.

These treaties had deep and lasting effect. Nanking Treaty, together with the following treaties of 1843, 1858, and 1860, ended the Canton System as created in 1760. These treaties created a new framework for China&#x27;s foreign relations and overseas trade, which would last for almost a hundred years and marked the start of what later nationalists called China&#x27;s &quot;century of humiliation.&quot; From the perspective of modern Chinese nationalists, the most injurious terms were the fixed trade tariff, extraterritoriality, the most favoured nation provisions and freeing the importation of British opium which continued to have social and economic consequences for the Chinese people. These terms were imposed by the British and extended to other Western powers with most favoured nation status, and were conceded by the ruling Qing dynasty in order to avert continued military defeats and under the hope that most favoured nation provision would set the foreigners against each other. Although China regained tariff autonomy in the 1920s, extraterritoriality was not formally abolished until the 1943 Sino-British Treaty for the Relinquishment of Extra-Territorial Rights in China.

The stipulation of legal equality in diplomatic proceedings between Britain and China ended the centuries-long Sinocentric tributary system of interstate relations that placed China atop a formal hierarchy in its interactions with other states. Despite this stipulation, the treaty&#x27;s contents featured entirely concessions from the Chinese side with no reciprocity of provisions on the British side - for instance, Britain received the right to establish consulates in treaty ports that held the right to an audience with local officials, an option denied to China should it have hypothetically wanted to send its own formal diplomatic missions to Britain. The one-sided nature of this treaty as a list of concessions, alongside the sovereignty ceded with the terms granting extraterritoriality and joint Sino-British determination of tariff, would earn the Nanking Treaty and similar settlements that followed the name, &quot;unequal treaty,&quot; from Chinese nationalists in later centuries.

Interestingly, Joanna Waley-Cohen writes that, at the time of its signing, the Qing did not regard the treaty as “of major significance.” According to Waley-Cohen, the Treaty of Nanking’s terms remarkably resembled another treaty signed with the central Asian state of Kokand, which had also conflicted with the Qing over control of trade along Qing frontiers. Failing to achieve results with a complete trade ban, the Qing arranged a treaty with Kokand that granted Kokandis “the right to live, trade, and levy taxes […] appoint consuls with extraterritorial jurisdiction over their compatriots in China,” alongside an indemnity. The precedent set by the treaty with Kokand made the Nanking Treaty palpable enough that the Qing did not immediately regard this settlement as a disastrous capitulation.

A copy of the treaty is kept by the British government while another copy is kept by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Republic of China at the National Palace Museum in Taipei, Taiwan.

<text>Geffen Records (formerly The David Geffen Company from 1980 to 1992 and Geffen Records Inc. from 1993 to 2004) is an American record label, founded in late 1980 by David Geffen. Originally a music subsidiary of the company known as Geffen Pictures, it is owned by the Interscope Geffen A&amp;M (IGA) faction of Universal Music Group (UMG).

Geffen has been a part of IGA since 1999 and has been used by Universal Music as a syndicating division of Interscope Records, serving its purpose to operate as a premier label for many new releases since 2003 and its 2017 reboot. At the same time, it is projected to reissue many releases from recording labels (some of which have been directly absorbed into Geffen) such as Decca Records (exclusively the American pop/rock catalog), Kapp Records, DreamWorks Records, MCA Records, Uni Records, Chess Records, Almo Sounds (Interscope has managed reissues of the label in 2015), Dot Records, ABC Records (primarily its pop, rock, and R&amp;B recordings) and DGC Records (the label had merged into Geffen in 2021 with reissues now being handled by the parent label).

== History ==
=== Formation (1980–1990) ===

Geffen Records began operations in 1980. It was created by music industry businessman David Geffen who, in the early 1970s, had co-founded Asylum Records with Elliot Roberts. Geffen stepped down from Asylum in 1975, when he crossed over to film and was named a vice president of Warner Bros. Pictures. He was fired from Warner , but still remained locked in a five-year contract, which prevented him from working elsewhere. When that deal expired, he returned to work in 1980 and struck a deal with Warner Bros. Records (now simply Warner Records, due to the label&#x27;s disassociation from Warner Bros. Pictures in 2004), to create Geffen Records. Warner Bros. Records provided 100 percent of the funding for the label&#x27;s start-up and operations, while it distributed its releases in North America, with CBS&#x27;s Epic Records handling distribution in the rest of the world until 1985 when Warner Music Group (parent company of Warner Records and formerly a division of Time Warner/Warner Bros. Discovery until 2004) took over distribution for the rest of the world. Profits were split 50% each between Geffen Records and its respective distributors. Despite being named for founder and original owner David Geffen, it has been acknowledged that Ed Rosenblatt, who became president of Geffen Records upon its inception in 1980, was the one who led Geffen Records during its heyday in the 1980s and 1990s.

The label&#x27;s first artist signing was superstar Donna Summer, whose gold-selling album &quot;The Wanderer&quot; became the label&#x27;s first release in October 1980. At the time, Donna Summer was undergoing a dispersing contract with and subsequent lawsuit against Universal Music Group&#x27;s Casablanca Records. The label then released &quot;Double Fantasy&quot; by John Lennon and Yoko Ono. Two weeks after it entered the charts, Lennon was murdered in New York City. Subsequently, the album went on to sell millions and gave Geffen its first number-one album and single; the rights to the album would later be taken over by EMI, which eventually would be absorbed by Geffen&#x27;s then-future parent, Universal Music Group in 2012.

As the mid-1980s progressed, Geffen would go on to have extended success with such acts as Asia, Berlin, Enya, Kylie Minogue, Quarterflash, Wang Chung, and Sammy Hagar. The label also signed several established acts such as Elton John, Irene Cara, Cher, Debbie Harry, Don Henley, Joni Mitchell, Neil Young, Peter Gabriel, and Jennifer Holliday. Toward the end of the decade, the company also began making a name for itself as an emerging rock label, thanks to the success of Whitesnake (U.S. and Canada only), The Stone Roses, Guns N&#x27; Roses, Tesla, Sonic Youth and the comeback of 1970s-era rockers Aerosmith. This prompted Geffen to create a subsidiary label, DGC Records (formerly the David Geffen Company), in 1990; which focused on more progressive rock and would later embrace the emergence of alternative rock—Nirvana being an example. Geffen also briefly distributed the first incarnation of Def American Recordings (now simply American Recordings) through Warner Music Group from 1988 to 1990.

=== Acquisitions by MCA, Panasonic, and Seagram and departure of David Geffen (1990–1998) ===
After nearly a decade of operating through WMG, its contract with the company ended. Geffen was then sold to MCA Music Entertainment, by then, a label division of the now-defunct MCA Inc. in 1990. The deal earned founder David Geffen an estimated US$800 million in stock and an employment contract that ran until then. Following the sale, Geffen Records operated as one of MCA&#x27;s leading independently managed labels. A year later, MCA was acquired by Japanese conglomerate Matsushita Electric (now Panasonic), bringing Geffen, Universal Pictures and other sister companies along. The acquisition was completed on New Year&#x27;s Day 1991 for $6.6 billion USD.

Geffen stepped down as head of the label in 1995 to collaborate with Jeffrey Katzenberg and Amblin Entertainment co-founder Steven Spielberg to form DreamWorks SKG (later DreamWorks Pictures), an ambitious multimedia empire dealing in film, television, books and music. Geffen Records would distribute releases on the newly-founded company&#x27;s DreamWorks Records subsidiary. That spring, Panasonic&#x27;s ownership percentage of MCA was decreased to 20% when the remaining 80% was sold to Canadian distillery company Seagram in exchange for $5.7 billion USD. In January 1996, Geffen funded and distributed a short-lived boutique label, Outpost Recordings, featuring the likes of Whiskeytown, Ry Cooder, Veruca Salt, and Hayden. On December 9, 1996, Geffen&#x27;s parent company, MCA Inc. was reincorporated as Universal Studios, Inc. Even so, its music division, MCA Music Entertainment Group, was also renamed Universal Music Group. However, under UMG&#x27;s new ownership, Geffen&#x27;s fortunes began to dwindle.

=== PolyGram merger and Interscope Geffen A&amp;M (1999–2003) ===
On December 10, 1998, Seagram completed its seven-month $10.6 billion plan to acquire PolyGram. As a result, PolyGram&#x27;s music division was merged into Universal Music Group. Geffen now became sister labels to A&amp;M Records, Island Records, Mercury Records, Def Jam Recordings and Motown (which had previously been a part of UMG during its preceding MCA days from 1988 to 1993). In the ensuing months, a number of corporate reshufflings occurred, resulting in Geffen and A&amp;M, on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1998, being merged into Interscope Geffen A&amp;M Records. Interscope Geffen A&amp;M became one of Universal Music Group&#x27;s four new label factions alongside the Verve Label Group, Universal Motown Republic Group and the Island Def Jam Music Group. However, the IGA merger resulted in Geffen firing 110 of its employees. Unlike A&amp;M, which was closed entirely, Geffen was able to continue existing as a one-off brand under Interscope Records. At the same time, international distribution of Interscope and Geffen releases respectively switched from BMG Distribution and Island Records UK to ex-PolyGram label Polydor Records, which had already been distributing A&amp;M releases overseas (in return for A&amp;M handling Polydor releases in the U.S.); A&amp;M was forced to remain as a one-off active label for Interscope following a lawsuit by its co-founders Jerry Moss and Herb Alpert, which was later settled in 2003.

In October 1999, Jordan Schur (of Flip Records) was declared Geffen&#x27;s new president; this led to Schur stepping down as the head of Flip, but he still managed to maintain control of the label, while certain acts from Flip&#x27;s roster, such as Cold and Professional Murder Music, were transferred over to Geffen. Geffen&#x27;s first release under Schur&#x27;s leadership was the &quot;End of Days&quot; soundtrack, released in November 1999. Geffen became a predominantly rock music-based label.

=== MCA, DGC and DreamWorks Records merger (2003) ===
Geffen continued to do steady business—even within 2003, UMG folded MCA Records into Geffen that July. Though Geffen had been substantially a pop-rock label, its absorption of MCA (and its back catalogs) led to a more diverse roster; with former MCA artists such as Mary J. Blige, The Roots, Blink-182, Rise Against, and Common now being transferred to the label. Meanwhile, DreamWorks Records, in October, also folded, with its artists roster, consisting of Nelly Furtado, Lifehouse and Rufus Wainwright, being absorbed by Geffen as well. The absorption occurred following a reorganization at DreamWorks Pictures, which resulted in DreamWorks Animation being divested and DreamWorks Records being acquired by UMG. During this time, the remains of DGC Records were also folded into Geffen, although the label was previously absorbed in 1999 following its merger with Interscope. Retained artists, Beck and Sonic Youth, were later redirected to record for Geffen afterwards; DGC was later reactivated in 2007, later operating under Interscope rather than Geffen.

With the mergers of MCA, DGC and DreamWorks into Geffen, more than 103 employees were laid off.

=== Continued success (2003–2009) ===
As the mid-2000s progressed, Geffen&#x27;s absorption of the MCA, DGC and DreamWorks labels, along with the signage of new acts such as Ashlee Simpson, Angels &amp; Airwaves and Snoop Dogg, had boosted the company to the extent that it began gaining equal footing with the main Interscope label, leading some industry insiders to speculate that it could revert to operating as an independently managed imprint at UMG again. In 2006, musician Ron Fair was named the chairman of Geffen. That same year, after disputes with Interscope co-founder Jimmy Iovine (at the time, the chairman and CEO of Interscope Geffen A&amp;M, parent unit of Geffen), former labelmates 50 Cent and Dr. Dre, rapper The Game was dismissed from G-Unit Records and Interscope division imprint Aftermath Entertainment (the respective labels of the aforementioned latter two), but was later transferred to Geffen to avoid contractual obligations with G-Unit. His sophomore studio album (also his first under the label), &quot;Doctor&#x27;s Advocate&quot;, debuted at number one on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 upon release on November 14, 2006.

Geffen&#x27;s urban division pertained even more notoriety with the IGA resigning of Keyshia Cole through the imprint, following DGC&#x27;s relaunch and A&amp;M&#x27;s revitalization as A&amp;M Octone Records in 2007; Cole was previously signed to sister label A&amp;M early in her career from 2004 to that point. Her sophomore album, &quot;Just like You&quot;, received critical praise and debuted at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. However, at the end of 2007, Geffen was subsided further into Interscope. The restructuring resulted in Geffen laying off sixty employees.

In 2009, it was announced that Geffen Records had signed an agreement with the Holy See to produce an album of Marian songs and prayers from Pope Benedict XVI.

=== Relaunches (2011–2017) ===
Interscope Geffen A&amp;M chairman and CEO Jimmy Iovine relaunched Geffen in 2011, moving its headquarters from Santa Monica to New York City. Former manager of Kanye West, Gee Roberson was appointed chairman. However, in late 2013, the label went idle with a majority of Geffen&#x27;s artists now recording under Interscope.

On May 28, 2014, Iovine departed from Interscope Geffen A&amp;M as its chairman and CEO and hired Fueled by Ramen co-founder John Janick as his replacement.

In March 2017, Neil Jacobson was appointed president of Geffen Records to oversee the second relaunch of the label via new signings as well as reinvigoration of the label&#x27;s legendary catalog.

=== Neil Jacobson&#x27;s departure and 2020s success (2019–present) ===
In 2018, Interscope musician DJ Snake was drafted to Geffen to release his second studio album, &quot;Carte Blanche&quot;, which commenced on July 26, 2019. Its single, &quot;Taki Taki&quot;, went on to accumulate four million equivalent units in the United States and peak at number one on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Hot Latin Songs chart.

In December 2019, Neil Jacobson vacated his position as the president of Geffen, leaving to start his own company, Crescent Drive Productions. The following month to a new year, in mid-January 2020, Lee L&#x27;Heureux was appointed the general manager of Geffen. The label then started to see more success from artists Rod Wave, Lil Durk, Yungblud and Hotboii (the former two were signed to Geffen through Todd Moscowitz&#x27;s Alamo Records).

In a staff exchange that July, longtime Interscope executive Nicole Bilzerian was drafted to Geffen to become its executive vice president.

Olivia Rodrigo joined Geffen in the fall of 2020. Her single, &quot;Drivers License&quot;, made the number one position on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in early 2021. That May, she released her debut album, &quot;Sour&quot;. It accumulated 295,000 album-equivalent units. Its five-week reign at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 became the longest by a female recording artist that year. &quot;Sour&quot; also made Rodrigo the first Geffen recording artist and first female artist overall to have a number one album under the label in nearly 13 years since Mary J. Blige&#x27;s &quot;Growing Pains&quot; (2007).

Rodrigo followed up &quot;Sour&quot; in 2023 with &quot;Guts&quot;. Released in September, it once again debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, though its first week units were moderately slim behind the artist&#x27;s debut. Also, in 2023, Interscope artist Kali Uchis was drafted to Geffen before releasing her sophomore album, &quot;Red Moon in Venus&quot;, earlier that March. The album peaked at number four on the Billboard 200, another top five charting success for the label that year.

Since 2024, Geffen has been a part of Universal Music Group&#x27;s Interscope Capitol Labels Group.

In July 2024, longtime former Geffen Records president Ed Rosenblatt, who served as president of Geffen Records from its inception in 1980 through its glory years of Guns N’ Roses, Nirvana, Don Henley and countless others, died.
