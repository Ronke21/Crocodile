<text>Adlai Ewing Stevenson II (; February 5, 1900 – July 14, 1965) was an American politician and diplomat and who was the United States ambassador to the United Nations from 1961 until his death in 1965. He previously served as the 31st governor of Illinois from 1949 to 1953 and was the Democratic nominee for president of the United States in 1952 and 1956, losing both elections to Dwight D. Eisenhower in landslides. Stevenson was the grandson of Adlai Stevenson, the 23rd vice president of the United States. He was raised in Bloomington, Illinois, and was a member of the Democratic Party. He served in many positions in the federal government during the 1930s and 1940s, including the Agricultural Adjustment Administration, Federal Alcohol Administration, Department of the Navy, and the State Department. In 1945, he served on the committee that created the United Nations, and was a member of the initial U.S. delegations to the UN.

In 1948, Stevenson was elected governor of Illinois, defeating incumbent governor Dwight H. Green in an upset. As governor, Stevenson reformed the state police, cracked down on illegal gambling, improved the state highways, and attempted to cleanse the state government of corruption. Stevenson also sought, with mixed success, to reform the Illinois state constitution and introduced several crime bills in the state legislature.

In 1952 and 1956, Stevenson was chosen as the Democratic nominee for president but was defeated in a landslide by Eisenhower both times. In 1960, he unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination for a third time at the Democratic National Convention. After President John F. Kennedy was elected, he appointed Stevenson as the United States ambassador to the United Nations (UN). Two major events Stevenson dealt with during his time as UN ambassador were the Bay of Pigs Invasion of Cuba in April 1961 and the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962. He was still serving as UN ambassador when he suffered a heart attack during a visit to London on July 14, 1965, dying later that day at the age of 65. He is buried in Evergreen Cemetery in his hometown of Bloomington, Illinois.

==Early life and education==

Adlai Ewing Stevenson II was born in Los Angeles, California, in a neighborhood that is now designated as the North University Park Historic District. His home and birthplace at 2639 Monmouth Avenue has been designated as a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument. He was a member of a prominent Illinois political family. His grandfather and namesake Adlai Stevenson was Vice President of the United States under President Grover Cleveland from 1893 to 1897. His father, Lewis Stevenson, never held an elected office, but was appointed Illinois Secretary of State (1914–1917) and was considered a strong contender for the Democratic vice-presidential nomination in 1928. A maternal great-grandfather, Jesse W. Fell, had been a close friend and campaign manager for Abraham Lincoln in his 1858 US Senate race; Stevenson often referred to Fell as his favorite ancestor. Stevenson&#x27;s eldest son, Adlai E. Stevenson III, became a U.S. Senator from Illinois (1970–1981). His mother was Helen Davis Stevenson, and he had an older sister, Elizabeth Stevenson Ives, an author who was called &quot;Buffie&quot;. Actor McLean Stevenson was a second cousin once removed. He was the nephew by marriage of novelist Mary Borden, and she assisted in the writing of some of his political speeches.

Stevenson was raised in the city of Bloomington, Illinois; his family was a member of Bloomington&#x27;s upper class and lived in one of the city&#x27;s well-to-do neighborhoods. On December 30, 1912, at the age of twelve, Stevenson accidentally killed Ruth Merwin, a 16-year-old friend, while demonstrating drill technique with a rifle, inadvertently left loaded, during a party at the Stevenson home. Stevenson was devastated by the accident and rarely mentioned or discussed it as an adult, even with his wife and children. However, in 1955 Stevenson heard about a woman whose son had experienced a similar tragedy. He wrote to her that she should tell her son that &quot;he must now live for two&quot;, which Stevenson&#x27;s friends took to be a reference to the shooting incident.

Stevenson left Bloomington High School after his junior year and attended University High School in Normal, Illinois, Bloomington&#x27;s &quot;twin city&quot;, just to the north. He then went to boarding school in Connecticut at The Choate School (now Choate Rosemary Hall), where he played on the tennis team, acted in plays, and was elected editor-in-chief of &quot;The Choate News&quot;, the school newspaper. Upon his graduation from Choate in 1918, he enlisted in the United States Naval Reserve for World War I. He served as a seaman apprentice while undergoing training but the Armistice of November 11, 1918 ended the war while he was still in training, and he was discharged as a seaman second class in January 1919.

He attended Princeton University, becoming managing editor of &quot;The Daily Princetonian&quot;, a member of the American Whig-Cliosophic Society, a member of the Quadrangle Club, and received a B.A. degree in 1922 in literature and history. Under prodding from his father, he then went to Harvard Law School, but found law to be &quot;uninteresting&quot;, and withdrew after failing several classes. He returned to Bloomington where he wrote for the family newspaper, &quot;The Daily Pantagraph&quot;, which was founded by his maternal great-grandfather Jesse Fell. The &quot;Pantagraph&quot;, which had one of the largest circulations of any newspaper in Illinois outside the Chicago area, was a main source of the Stevenson family&#x27;s wealth. Following his mother&#x27;s death in 1935, Adlai inherited one-quarter of the &quot;Pantagraph&#x27;s&quot; stock, providing him with a large, dependable source of income for the rest of his life.

A year after leaving Harvard, Stevenson became interested in the law again after talking to Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. When he returned home to Bloomington, he decided to finish his degree at Northwestern University School of Law, attending classes during the week and returning to Bloomington on the weekends to write for the &quot;Pantagraph&quot;. Stevenson received his J.D. degree from Northwestern in 1926 and passed the Illinois state bar examination the same year. He obtained a position at Cutting, Moore &amp; Sidley, one of Chicago&#x27;s oldest and most prestigious law firms.

===Family===
On December 1, 1928, Stevenson married Ellen Borden, a well-to-do socialite. The young couple soon became popular and familiar figures on the Chicago social scene; they especially enjoyed attending and hosting costume parties. They had three sons: Adlai Stevenson III, who would become a U.S. Senator; Borden Stevenson, and John Fell Stevenson. In 1935, Adlai and Ellen purchased a tract of land along the Des Plaines River near Libertyville, Illinois, a wealthy suburb of Chicago. They built a home on the property and it served as Stevenson&#x27;s official residence for the rest of his life. Although he spent relatively little time there due to his career, Stevenson did consider the estate to be his home, and in the 1950s, he was often called &quot;The Man from Libertyville&quot; by the national news media. Stevenson also purchased a farm in northwestern Illinois, just outside Galena, where he frequently rode horses and kept some cattle.

On December 12, 1949, Adlai and Ellen were divorced; their son Adlai III later recalled that &quot;There hadn&#x27;t been a good relationship for a long time. I remember her [Ellen] as the unreasonable one, not only with Dad, but with us and the servants. I was embarrassed by her peremptory way with servants.&quot; Several of Stevenson&#x27;s biographers have written that his wife suffered from mental illness: &quot;Incidents that went from petulant to bizarre to nasty generally have been described without placing them in the context of the progression of [her] increasingly serious mental illness. It was an illness that those closest to her – including Adlai for long after the divorce – were slow and reluctant to recognize. Hindsight, legal proceedings, and psychiatric testimony now make understandable the behavior that baffled and saddened her family.&quot; Stevenson did not remarry after his divorce, but instead dated a number of prominent women throughout the rest of his life, including Alicia Patterson, Marietta Tree, and Betty Beale.

===Religion===
Stevenson belonged to the Unitarian faith, and was a longtime member of Bloomington&#x27;s Unitarian church. However, he also occasionally attended Presbyterian services in Libertyville, where a Unitarian church was not present, and as governor he became close friends with the Rev. Richard Graebel, the pastor of Springfield&#x27;s First Presbyterian church. Graebel &quot;acknowledged that Stevenson&#x27;s Unitarian rearing had imbued him with the means of translating religious and ethical values into civic issues&quot;. According to one historian, &quot;religion never disappeared entirely from his public messages – it was indeed part of his appeal&quot;.

==Early career==

In July 1933, Stevenson took a job opportunity as special attorney and assistant to Jerome Frank, the general counsel of the Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA), a part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal. Following the repeal of Prohibition in December 1933, Stevenson changed jobs, becoming chief attorney for the Federal Alcohol Control Administration (FACA), a subsidiary of the AAA which regulated the activities of the alcohol industry.

In 1935, Stevenson returned to Chicago to practice law. He became involved in civic activities, particularly as chairman of the Chicago branch of the Committee to Defend America by Aiding the Allies from 1940 to 1941. As chairman, Stevenson worked to raise public support for military and economic aid to the United Kingdom and its allies in fighting Nazi Germany during the Second World War. Stevenson &quot;believed Britain [was] America&#x27;s first line of defense&quot; and &quot;argued for a repeal of the neutrality legislation&quot; and support for President Roosevelt&#x27;s Lend-Lease programme. His efforts earned strong criticism from Colonel Robert R. McCormick, the powerful, isolationist publisher of the &quot;Chicago Tribune,&quot; and a leading member of the non-interventionist America First Committee.

In 1940, Major Frank Knox, newly appointed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt as Secretary of the Navy, offered Stevenson a position as Principal Attorney and special assistant. Stevenson accepted the position and in this capacity wrote speeches, represented Secretary Knox and the Navy on committees, toured the various theaters of war, and handled many administrative duties. Since Knox was largely a figurehead, there were few major roles for Stevenson. However, in early 1944 he joined a mission to Sicily and Italy for the Foreign Economic Administration to report on the country&#x27;s economy. After Knox died in April 1944, Stevenson returned to Chicago where he attempted to purchase Knox&#x27;s controlling interest in the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot;, but his syndicate was outbid by another party.

In 1945, Stevenson took a temporary position in the State Department, as special assistant to US Secretary of State Edward Stettinius to work with Assistant Secretary of State Archibald MacLeish on a proposed world organization. Later that year, he went to London as Deputy United States Delegate to the Preparatory Commission of the United Nations Organization, a position he held until February 1946. When the head of the delegation fell ill, Stevenson assumed his role. His work at the commission, and in particular his dealings with the representatives of the Soviet Union, resulted in appointments to the US delegations to the United Nations in 1946 and 1947.

==Governor of Illinois, 1949 to 1953==

In 1948, Stevenson was chosen by Jacob Arvey, leader of the powerful Chicago Democratic political organization, to be the Democratic candidate in the Illinois gubernatorial race against the incumbent Republican, Dwight H. Green. In an upset, Stevenson defeated Green by 572,067 votes, a record margin in Illinois gubernatorial elections. President Truman carried Illinois by only 33,612 votes against his Republican opponent, Thomas E. Dewey, leading a biographer to write that &quot;Clearly, Adlai had carried the President in with him.&quot; Paul Douglas, a University of Chicago professor of economics, was elected senator on the same ticket.

Principal among Stevenson&#x27;s achievements as Illinois governor were reforming the state police by removing political considerations from hiring practices and instituting a merit system for employment and promotion, cracking down on illegal gambling, and improving the state highways. He sought, with mixed success, to cleanse the Illinois state government of corruption; in one instance he fired the warden of the state penitentiary for overcrowding, political corruption, and incompetence that had left the prisoners on the verge of revolt, and in another instance Stevenson fired the superintendent of an institution for alcoholics when he learned that the superintendent, after receiving bribes from local tavern owners, was allowing the patients to buy drinks at local bars. Two of Stevenson&#x27;s major initiatives as governor were a proposal to create a constitutional convention (called &quot;con-con&quot;) to reform and improve the Illinois state constitution, and several crime bills that would have provided new resources and methods to fight criminal activities in Illinois. Most of the crime bills and con-con failed to pass the state legislature, much to Stevenson&#x27;s chagrin. However, Stevenson agreed to support a Republican alternative to con-con called &quot;Gateway&quot;, it passed the legislature and was approved by Illinois voters in a 1950 referendum. Stevenson&#x27;s push for an improved state constitution &quot;began the process of constitutional change...and in 1969, four years after his death, the goal was achieved. It was perhaps his most important achievement as governor.&quot; The new constitution had the effect of removing the structural limitations on the growth of government in the state.

Stevenson&#x27;s governorship coincided with the Second Red Scare, and during his term, the Illinois state legislature passed a bill that would have &quot;made it a felony to belong to any subversive group&quot;, and would have required &quot;a loyalty oath of public employees and candidates for office.&quot; Stevenson vetoed the bill. In his public message regarding the veto, Stevenson wrote:Does anyone seriously think that a real traitor will hesitate to sign a loyalty oath? Of course not. Really dangerous subversives and saboteurs will be caught by careful, constant, professional investigation, not by pieces of paper. The whole notion of loyalty inquisitions is a natural characteristic of the police state, not of democracy. I know full well this veto will be distorted and misunderstood...I know that to veto this bill in this period of grave anxiety will be unpopular with many. But I must, in good conscience, protest against any unnecessary suppression of our ancient rights as free men...we will win the contest of ideas that afflicts the world not by suppressing those rights, but by their triumph.

Stevenson proved to be a popular public speaker and gained a national reputation as an intellectual, with a self-deprecating sense of humor to match. One example came when the Illinois legislature passed a bill (supported by bird lovers) declaring that cats roaming unescorted was a public nuisance. Stevenson vetoed the bill and sent this public message regarding the veto:It is in the nature of cats to do a certain amount of unescorted roaming... the problem of cat versus bird is as old as time. If we attempt to solve it by legislation who knows but what we may be called upon to take sides as well in the age old problem of dog versus cat, bird versus bird, or even bird versus worm. In my opinion, the State of Illinois and its local governing bodies already have enough to do without trying to control feline delinquency. For these reasons, and not because I love birds the less or cats the more, I veto and withhold my approval from Senate Bill No. 93.

On June 2, 1949, Stevenson privately gave a sworn deposition as a character witness for Alger Hiss, a former State Department official who was later found to be a spy for the Soviet Union. Stevenson had infrequently worked with Hiss, first in the legal division of the Agricultural Adjustment Administration in 1933 and then in 1945, 1946, and 1947 on various United Nations projects, but he was not a close friend or associate of him. In the deposition, Stevenson testified that the reputation of Hiss for integrity, loyalty, and veracity was good. In 1950, Hiss was found guilty of perjury on the spying charges. Stevenson&#x27;s deposition, according to his biographer Porter McKeever, would later be used in the 1952 presidential campaign by Senators Joseph McCarthy and Richard Nixon to &quot;inflame public opinion and attack Adlai as &#x27;soft on communism&#x27;.&quot; In the 1952 campaign, Senator Nixon would claim that Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;defense of Hiss&quot; reflected such &quot;poor judgment&quot; on his part that &quot;doubt was cast about Adlai&#x27;s capacity to govern.&quot; In a 1952 appearance on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Meet the Press&quot;, Stevenson responded to a question about his deposition for Hiss by saying, &quot;I&#x27;m a lawyer. I think that one of the most fundamental responsibilities... particularly of lawyers, is to give testimony in a court of law, to give it honestly and willingly, and it will be a very unhappy day for Anglo-Saxon justice when a man, even in public life, is too timid to state what he knows and what he has heard about a defendant in a criminal trial for fear that defendant might later be convicted. That would to me be the ultimate timidity.&quot;

==1952 presidential bid==
Early in 1952, while Stevenson was still governor of Illinois, President Harry S. Truman decided that he would not seek another term as president. Instead, Truman met with Stevenson in Washington and proposed that Stevenson seek the Democratic nomination for president; Truman promised him his support if he did so. Stevenson at first hesitated, arguing that he was committed to running for a second gubernatorial term in Illinois. However, a number of his friends and associates (such as George Wildman Ball) quietly began organizing a &quot;draft Stevenson&quot; movement for president; they persisted in their activity even when Stevenson (both publicly and privately) told them to stop. When Stevenson continued to state that he was not a candidate, President Truman and the Democratic Party leadership looked for other prospective candidates. However, each of the other main contenders had a major weakness. Senator Estes Kefauver of Tennessee won most of the presidential primaries and entered the 1952 Democratic National Convention with the largest number of delegates, but he was unpopular with President Truman and other prominent Democrats. In 1950, Kefauver had chaired a Senate committee that traveled to several large cities and held televised hearings into organized crime. The hearings revealed connections between organized-crime syndicates and big-city Democratic political organizations, which led Truman and other Democratic leaders to oppose Kefauver&#x27;s bid for the nomination: &quot;a machine politician and proud of it, [Truman] had no use for reformers who blackened the names of fellow Democrats.&quot; Truman favored U.S. diplomat W. Averell Harriman, but he had never held elected office and was inexperienced in national politics. Truman next turned to his vice-president, Alben Barkley, but at 74 years of age he was dismissed as being too old by labor union leaders. Senator Richard Russell Jr. of Georgia was popular in the South and his campaign easily won the Florida primary, but his support for racial segregation and opposition to civil rights for blacks made him unacceptable to Northern and Western Democrats. In the end, Stevenson, despite his reluctance to run, remained the most attractive candidate heading into the 1952 Democratic National Convention in Chicago.

At the convention, Stevenson, as governor of the host state, was assigned to give the welcoming address to the delegates. His speech was so stirring and witty that it invigorated efforts to secure the nomination for him, in spite of his continued protests that he was not a presidential candidate. In his welcoming speech he poked fun at the 1952 Republican National Convention, which had been held in Chicago in the same coliseum two weeks earlier. Stevenson described the achievements of the Democratic Party under Presidents Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman, but noted:our Republican friends have said it was all a miserable failure. For almost a week pompous phrases marched over this landscape in search of an idea, and the only idea that they found was that the two great decades of progress...were the misbegotten spawn of bungling, of corruption, of socialism, of mismanagement, of waste and worse...after listening to this everlasting procession of epithets about our [party&#x27;s] misdeeds I was even surprised the next morning when the mail was delivered on time. But we Democrats were by no means the only victims here. First they [Republicans] slaughtered each other, and then they went after us...perhaps the proximity of the stockyards accounts for the carnage.

Following this speech, the Illinois delegation (led by Jacob Arvey) announced that they would place Stevenson&#x27;s name in nomination, and Stevenson called President Truman to ask if &quot;he would be embarrassed&quot; if Stevenson formally announced his candidacy for the nomination. Truman told Stevenson &quot;I have been trying since January to get you to say that. Why should it embarrass me?&quot; Kefauver led on the first ballot, but was well below the vote total he needed to win. Stevenson gradually gained strength until he was nominated on the third ballot. The 1952 Democratic National Convention was the last political convention of either major party to require more than one ballot to nominate a presidential candidate.

Historian John Frederick Martin says party leaders selected Stevenson because he was &quot;more moderate on civil rights than Estes Kefauver, yet nonetheless acceptable to labor and urban machines—so a coalition of southern, urban, and labor leaders fell in behind his candidacy in Chicago&quot;. Stevenson&#x27;s 1952 running mate was Senator John Sparkman of Alabama.

Stevenson accepted the Democratic nomination with an acceptance speech that, according to contemporaries, &quot;electrified the delegates:&quot;

Although Stevenson&#x27;s eloquent oratory and thoughtful, stylish demeanor impressed many intellectuals, journalists, political commentators, and members of the nation&#x27;s academic community, the Republicans and some working-class Democrats ridiculed what they perceived as his indecisive, aristocratic air. During the 1952 campaign Stewart Alsop, a powerful Connecticut Republican, labeled Stevenson an &quot;egghead&quot;, based on his baldness and intellectual air. His brother, the influential newspaper columnist Joe Alsop, used the word to underscore Stevenson&#x27;s difficulty in attracting working-class voters, and the nickname stuck. Stevenson himself made fun of his &quot;egghead&quot; nickname; in one speech he joked &quot;eggheads of the world unite, you have nothing to lose but your yolks!&quot; In his campaign speeches Stevenson strongly criticized the Communist-hunting tactics of Senator Joseph McCarthy, labeling &quot;McCarthy&#x27;s kind of patriotism&quot; as &quot;a disgrace&quot; and ridiculing right-wing Republicans &quot;who hunt Communists in the Bureau of Wildlife and Fisheries while hesitating to aid the gallant men and women who are resisting the real thing in the front lines of Europe and Asia...they are finally the men who seemingly believe that we can confound the Kremlin by frightening ourselves to death.&quot; In return, Senator McCarthy stated in a speech that &quot;he would like to get on the Stevenson campaign trail with a club and thereby make a good and loyal American out of the governor&quot;.

In the 1952 campaign, Stevenson also developed a strong dislike for Richard M. Nixon, then the GOP vice-presidential candidate. &quot;Adlai literally loathed Nixon. No other person aroused such disgust; not even Joseph McCarthy...Friends who often wished he could be more of a hater were awed at the strength of his distaste for Nixon.&quot; A biographer wrote that &quot;for Stevenson, Nixon was an ambitious, unprincipled partisan who craved winning, the exact personification of what was wrong with modern American politics...[for Stevenson] Nixon was an entirely plastic politician...Nixon was Stevenson&#x27;s complete villain. Others sensed the potential for immorality that led to Nixon&#x27;s humiliating resignation in 1974, but Stevenson was among the first.&quot; During the 1952 campaign Stevenson often used his wit to attack Nixon, and once stated that Nixon &quot;was the kind of politician who would cut down a redwood tree, and then mount the stump and make a speech for [tree] conservation&quot;.

Journalist David Halberstam later wrote that &quot;Stevenson [was] an elegant campaigner who raised the political discourse&quot; and that in 1952 &quot;Stevenson reinvigorated [the Democratic Party] and made it seem an open and exciting place for a generation of younger Americans who might otherwise never have thought of working for a political candidate.&quot; During the campaign, a photograph revealed a hole in the sole of Stevenson&#x27;s right shoe. This became a symbol of Stevenson&#x27;s frugality and earthiness. The Eisenhower campaign attempted to use the symbol of the shoe with a hole to criticize Stevenson in advertising, to which Stevenson said, “Better a hole in the shoe than a hole in the head.” Photographer William M. Gallagher of the &quot;Flint Journal&quot; won the 1953 Pulitzer prize on the strength of the image.

Stevenson did not use television as effectively as his Republican opponent, war hero Dwight D. Eisenhower, and was unable to rally the New Deal voting coalition for one last hurrah. Historian Richard Aldous wrote &quot;Occasionally persuasive, [Stevenson] was rarely compelling and, unlike Eisenhower, he lacked any kind of rapport or common touch with large crowds. He also failed to respond quickly enough to Eisenhower&#x27;s pioneering use of TV. Both candidates resisted the new medium at first, but Ike relented sooner. He used &quot;Mad Men&quot; advertising executive Rosser Reeves of the Ted Bates agency to create brilliant thirty-second TV spots. Ironically, Stevenson came across well on TV, but his arrogant nature caused him to minimize it in the campaign. &quot;This is the worst thing I&#x27;ve ever heard of,&quot; he scoffed, &quot;selling the presidency like breakfast cereal!&quot; That attitude left him behind the curve.&quot; On election day, Eisenhower won the national popular vote by 55% to 45%. Stevenson lost heavily outside the Solid South; he carried only nine states and lost the Electoral College vote 442 to 89. In his concession speech on election night, Stevenson said: &quot;Someone asked me...how I felt, and I was reminded of a story that a fellow townsman of ours used to tell – Abraham Lincoln. He said he felt like the little boy who had stubbed his toe in the dark. He said that he was too old to cry, but it hurt too much to laugh.&quot;

Biographer Jean H. Baker summarized Stevenson&#x27;s 1952 campaign: &quot;Uncomfortable with the carnival side of elections, Stevenson tried to be a man for the people, not of them; a man of reason talking sense, not manipulation or sentiment.&quot; He continued:Liberals...were attracted to the Illinois governor because he firmly opposed McCarthyism, [and] they also appreciated Stevenson because of his style...he had clearly dissociated himself, as did many Americans, from the plebians. Stevenson dramatized the complex feelings of educated elites, some of whom came to adore him not because he was a liberal, but because he was not...he spoke a language that set apart from average Americans an increasingly college-educated population. His approach to voters as rational participants in a process that depended on weighing the issues attracted reformers, intellectuals, and middle-class women with time and money (the &quot;Shakespeare vote&quot;, joked one columnist). Or as one enthralled voter wrote &quot;You were too good for the American people ... Adlai Stevenson ended the 1952 campaign with an adoring group of Stevensonites. Articulate and loyal...they would soon create the Stevenson legend and make the Man from Libertyville a counterhero to President Eisenhower, whom they would portray as inept and banal.&quot;

===1953 World Tour and 1954 elections===
Following his defeat, Stevenson in 1953 made a well-publicized world tour through Asia, the Middle East and Europe, writing about his travels for &quot;Look&quot; magazine. His political stature as head of the Democratic Party gave him access to many foreign leaders and dignitaries. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1953. In the 1954 off-year elections, Stevenson took a leading role in campaigning for Democratic congressional and gubernatorial candidates around the nation. When the Democrats won control of both houses of Congress and picked up nine gubernatorial seats it &quot;put Democrats around the country in Stevenson&#x27;s debt and greatly strengthened his position as his party&#x27;s leader.&quot;

==1956 presidential bid==
Unlike 1952, Stevenson was an announced, active candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1956. Initially, with polls showing Eisenhower headed for a landslide re-election, few Democrats wanted the 1956 nomination, and Stevenson hoped that he could win the nomination without a serious contest, and without entering any presidential primaries. However, on September 24, 1955, Eisenhower suffered a serious heart attack. Although he recovered and eventually decided to run for a second term, concerns about his health led two prominent Democrats, Tennessee Senator Estes Kefauver and New York Governor Averell Harriman, to decide to challenge Stevenson for the Democratic nomination. After being told by his aides that he needed to enter and win several presidential primaries to defeat Kefauver and Harriman, Stevenson officially entered the race on November 16, 1955, and campaigned in the Minnesota, Florida, and California primaries. Stevenson was upset in the Minnesota primary by Kefauver, who successfully portrayed him as a &quot;captive&quot; of corrupt Chicago political bosses and &quot;a corporation lawyer out of step with regular Democrats&quot;. Stevenson next battled Kefauver in the Florida primary, where he agreed to debate Kefauver on radio and television. Stevenson later joked that in Florida he had appealed to the state&#x27;s citrus farmers by &quot;bitterly denouncing the Japanese beetle and fearlessly attacking the Mediterranean fruit fly&quot;. He narrowly defeated Kefauver in Florida by 12,000 votes, and then won the California primary over Kefauver with 63% of the vote, effectively ending Kefauver&#x27;s presidential bid.

At the 1956 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, former President Truman endorsed Governor Harriman, to Stevenson&#x27;s dismay, but the blow was softened by former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt&#x27;s continued enthusiastic support. Stevenson easily defeated Harriman on the first ballot, winning his second Democratic presidential nomination. He was aided by strong support from younger delegates, who were said to form the core of the &quot;New Politics&quot; movement. In a bid to raise enthusiasm for the Democratic ticket, Stevenson made the unusual decision to leave the selection of his running mate up to the convention delegates. This set off a frantic scramble among several prominent Democrats to win the vice-presidential nomination, including Kefauver, Senator Hubert Humphrey, and Senator John F. Kennedy. After fending off a surprisingly strong challenge from Kennedy, Kefauver narrowly won the vice-presidential nomination on the second ballot. In his acceptance speech, Stevenson spoke of his plan for a &quot;New America&quot;, which included extending New Deal programs to &quot;areas of education, health, and poverty&quot;. He also criticized Republicans for trying to &quot;merchandise candidates like breakfast cereal&quot;.

Following his nomination, Stevenson waged a vigorous presidential campaign, delivering 300 speeches and traveling ; he crisscrossed the nation three times before the election in November. Robert F. Kennedy traveled with the Stevenson campaign, hoping to &quot;take home some lessons on how to manage a presidential campaign&quot;. Kennedy was deeply disillusioned by Stevenson&#x27;s campaign, later saying that &quot;I thought it was ghastly. It was poorly organized...my feeling was that he had no rapport with his audience – no comprehension of what campaigning required, no ability to make decisions...In 1952 I had been crazy about him...Then I spent six weeks with him on the campaign and he destroyed it all.&quot; Kennedy voted for Eisenhower in November. For their part, Stevenson and many of his aides resented Kennedy&#x27;s attitude during his stay with the campaign; Stevenson friend and aide George W. Ball recalled &quot;My impression was that Bobby was a very surly and arrogant young man...he wasn&#x27;t doing any good for Adlai. I don&#x27;t know why we had him along.&quot; The tension that developed between Stevenson and Robert Kennedy would have significant consequences for the 1960 presidential campaign, and for Stevenson&#x27;s relationships with both John and Robert Kennedy during President Kennedy&#x27;s administration.

Against the advice of many of his political advisers, Stevenson insisted on calling for an international ban to aboveground nuclear weapons tests, and for an end to the military draft. Despite strong criticism from President Eisenhower and other leading Republicans, such as Vice President Nixon and former New York Governor Thomas Dewey, that his proposals were naïve and would benefit the Soviet Union in the Cold War, Stevenson held his ground and said in various speeches that &quot;Earth&#x27;s atmosphere is contaminated from week to week by exploding hydrogen bombs...We don&#x27;t want to live forever in the shadow of a radioactive mushroom cloud... [and] growing children are the principal potential sufferers&quot; of increased strontium 90 in the atmosphere. In the end, Stevenson&#x27;s push to ban atmospheric nuclear bomb tests &quot;cost him dearly in votes,&quot; but &quot;Adlai finally won the verdict,&quot; as Eisenhower suspended above-ground nuclear tests in 1958, President Kennedy would sign the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty into law in 1963, and President Nixon would end the military draft in 1973.

Civil rights was emerging rapidly as a major political issue. Stevenson urged caution and warned against aggressive enforcement of the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; in order to gain Southern white support. Kotlowski writes:
Stevenson&#x27;s views on racial progress were described after his death by his long-time companion Marietta Tree as: &quot;He thought of all Negroes as being loveable old family retainers and not as individuals like you and me who were longing to get educated and who had aspirations and dreams just like the rest of us. I think this took him a long time to get over--the fact that they really indeed not only were created equal; they wanted equality of opportunity and wanted it now. It was hard for him to understand the urgency.&quot;

While President Eisenhower suffered heart problems, the economy enjoyed robust health. Stevenson&#x27;s hopes for victory were dashed when, in October, Eisenhower&#x27;s doctors gave him a clean bill of health and the Suez and Hungary crises erupted simultaneously. The public was not convinced that a change in leadership was needed. Stevenson lost his second bid for the presidency by a landslide, winning only 42% of the popular vote and 73 electoral votes from just seven states, all except Missouri in the solid Democratic South.

Early in 1957, Stevenson resumed law practice and allied himself with Judge Simon H. Rifkind to create a law firm based in Washington, DC. (Stevenson, Paul, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison), and a second firm in Chicago (Stevenson, Rifkind &amp; Wirtz). Both law firms were related to New York City&#x27;s Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison. Stevenson&#x27;s associates in the new law firm included Willard Wirtz, William McCormick Blair Jr., and Newton N. Minow; each of these men later served in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations. He also accepted an appointment, along with other prominent Democrats, to the new Democratic Advisory Council, which &quot;pursued an aggressive line in attacking the [Republican] Eisenhower administration and in developing new Democratic policies&quot;. He was also employed part-time by the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; as a legal consultant.

==1960 presidential campaign and appointment as UN ambassador==
In early 1960, Stevenson announced that he would not seek a third Democratic presidential nomination, but would accept a draft. One of his closest friends told a journalist that &quot;Deep down, he wants [the Democratic nomination]. But he wants the [Democratic] Convention to come to him, he doesn&#x27;t want to go to the Convention.&quot; In May 1960, Senator John F. Kennedy, who was actively campaigning for the Democratic nomination, visited Stevenson at his Libertyville home. Kennedy asked Stevenson for a public endorsement of his candidacy; in exchange Kennedy promised, if elected, to appoint Stevenson as his Secretary of State. Stevenson turned down the offer, which strained relations between the two men. At the 1960 Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, Stevenson&#x27;s admirers, led by Eleanor Roosevelt, Agnes Meyer, and such Hollywood celebrities as Dore Schary and Henry Fonda, vigorously promoted him for the nomination, even though he was not an announced candidate. JFK&#x27;s campaign manager, his brother Robert F. Kennedy, reportedly threatened Stevenson in a meeting, telling him that unless he agreed to place his brother&#x27;s name in nomination &quot;you are through&quot;. Stevenson refused and ordered him out of his hotel room. In letters to friends, Stevenson described both John and Robert Kennedy as &quot;cold and ruthless&quot;, referred to Robert Kennedy as the &quot;Black Prince&quot;, and expressed his belief that JFK, &quot;though bright and able, was too young, too unseasoned, to be President; he pushed too hard, was in too much of a hurry; he lacked the wisdom of humility...[Stevenson felt] that both Kennedy and the nation would benefit from a postponement of his ambition.&quot;

The night before the balloting, Stevenson began working actively for the nomination, calling the leaders of several state delegations to ask for their support. The key call went to Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley, the leader of the Illinois delegation. The delegation had already voted to give Kennedy 59.5 votes to Stevenson&#x27;s 2, but Stevenson told Daley that he now wanted the Democratic nomination, and asked him if the &quot;delegates&#x27; vote might merely indicate they thought he was not a candidate&quot;. Daley told Stevenson that he had no support in the delegation. Stevenson then &quot;asked if this meant no support in fact or no support because the delegates thought he was not a candidate. Daley replied that Stevenson had no support.&quot; According to Stevenson&#x27;s biographer John Bartlow Martin, the phone conversation with Daley &quot;was the real end of the [1960] Stevenson candidacy...if he could not get the support of his home state his candidacy was doomed&quot;. However, Stevenson continued to work for the nomination the next day, fulfilling what he felt were obligations to old friends and supporters such as Eleanor Roosevelt and Agnes Meyer. Senator Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota delivered an impassioned nominating speech for Stevenson, urging the convention to not &quot;reject the man who has made us proud to be Democrats. Do not leave this prophet without honor in his own party.&quot; However, Kennedy won the nomination on the first ballot with 806 delegate votes; Stevenson finished in fourth place with 79.5 votes.

Once Kennedy won the nomination, Stevenson, always an enormously popular public speaker, campaigned actively for him. Due to his two presidential nominations and previous United Nations experience, Stevenson perceived himself an elder statesman and the natural choice for Secretary of State. However, according to historian Robert Dallek, &quot;neither Jack nor Bobby [Kennedy] thought all that well of Stevenson...they saw him as rather prissy and ineffective. [Stevenson] never met their standard of tough-mindedness.&quot; Stevenson&#x27;s refusal to publicly endorse Kennedy before the Democratic Convention was something that Kennedy &quot;couldn&#x27;t forgive&quot;, with JFK telling a Stevenson supporter after the election, &quot;I&#x27;m not going to give him anything.&quot; The prestigious post of Secretary of State went instead to the (then) little-known Dean Rusk. However, &quot;although Jack and Bobby would have been just as happy to freeze Stevenson out of the administration, they felt compelled to offer him something&quot; due to his continued support from progressive Democrats. President Kennedy offered Stevenson the choice of becoming ambassador to Britain, attorney general (a post that eventually went to Robert Kennedy), or United States Ambassador to the United Nations. Stevenson accepted the UN position.

Many years later, it was revealed that during the campaign Stevenson was approached by Soviet ambassador Menshikov who offered Soviet financial and public relations help to assist him in getting elected if he decided to run. Stevenson flatly rejected the Soviet offer, telling Menshikov that he &quot;considered the offer of such assistance highly improper, indiscreet and dangerous to all concerned&quot;. Stevenson then reported the incident directly to President Eisenhower.

==Ambassador to the United Nations, 1961 to 1965==

At the United Nations, Stevenson worked hard to support U.S. foreign policy, even when he personally disagreed with some of President Kennedy&#x27;s actions. However, he was often seen as an outsider in the Kennedy administration, with one historian noting &quot;everyone knew that Stevenson&#x27;s position was that of a bit player&quot;. Kennedy told his adviser Walt Rostow that &quot;Stevenson wouldn&#x27;t be happy as president. He thinks that if you talk long enough you get a soft option and there are very few soft options as president.&quot;

===Bay of Pigs incident===

In April 1961 Stevenson suffered the greatest humiliation of his diplomatic career in the Bay of Pigs invasion. After hearing rumors that &quot;a lot of refugees wanted to go back and overthrow Castro&quot;, Stevenson voiced his skepticism about an invasion, but &quot;he was kept on the fringes of the operation, receiving...nine days before the invasion, only an unduly vague briefing by Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.&quot; and the CIA. Senior CIA official Tracy Barnes told Stevenson and his staff that &quot;there was going to be a clandestine operation in Cuba...it was strictly a Cuban affair. It would have some American cooperation, but only with the training and financing.&quot; According to historian Peter Wyden, Barnes did not tell Stevenson that there would be a large-scale invasion of Cuba, nor did he provide details about the full extent of American support for, and involvement with, the Cuban rebels, nor did he tell Stevenson about the planned air strikes to destroy Castro&#x27;s air force. Kennedy Library historian Sheldon Stern interviewed Ambassador Charles W. Yost, Stevenson&#x27;s deputy, who attended the meeting and confirmed that Yost had been suspicious of the story from the start. Yost agreed that this was another one of the CIA&#x27;s &quot;clumsy tricks&quot;. Assistant Secretary of State Harlan Cleveland, who attended the briefing, felt that Barnes was too evasive in his description of the operation, and that it was clear that Stevenson was not to be given the full details of the invasion plan. Historian Garry Wills has written that &quot;news of the invasion was leaking out...Castro knew the landings would occur; only Adlai Stevenson was kept in the dark&quot; about the invasion by President Kennedy and his aides.

Kennedy, anticipating that Stevenson might be angered at being left out of the discussions over whether to invade Cuba, told Schlesinger that &quot;the integrity and credibility of Adlai Stevenson constitute one of our great national assets. I don&#x27;t want to do anything to jeopardize that&quot;, and he asked Schlesinger to let Stevenson know that the president was shielding him from many of the details to protect him in case the clandestine operation failed. Instead, as Robert Dallek has written, &quot;by leaving him out of the discussion it led to his humiliation&quot;. Unaware that the anti-Castro Cuban exiles landing at the Bay of Pigs were being armed and assisted directly by the CIA and US Navy, and that American pilots were participating in bombing raids of Cuban targets, Stevenson unwittingly &quot;repeated a CIA cover story in a speech before the UN General Assembly&quot;. He argued that the rebels were not assisted in any way by the U.S. government; when this claim was proven to be false Stevenson complained that &quot;I took this job on the understanding that I would be consulted and kept fully informed on everything. Now my credibility has been compromised and therefore my usefulness.&quot; When he told his friend Harlan Cleveland that his own government had &quot;deliberately tricked&quot; him into believing there was no direct American involvement in the invasion, Cleveland replied &quot;I feel as betrayed as you do.&quot; Stevenson seriously considered resigning, but was convinced by his friends and President Kennedy to stay.

===Cuban Missile Crisis===

During the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, Stevenson gave a presentation at an emergency session of the Security Council. In his presentation, which attracted national television coverage, he forcefully asked Soviet UN representative Valerian Zorin if his country was installing nuclear missiles in Cuba, and when Zorin appeared reluctant to reply, Stevenson punctuated with the demand &quot;Don&#x27;t wait for the translation, [answer] &#x27;yes&#x27; or &#x27;no&#x27;!&quot; When Zorin replied that &quot;I am not in an American court of law, and therefore do not answer a question put to me in the manner of a prosecuting counsel...you will have your answer in due course&quot;, Stevenson retorted, &quot;I am prepared to wait for my answer until Hell freezes over.&quot; Stevenson then showed photographs taken by a U-2 spy plane which proved the existence of nuclear missiles in Cuba, just after Zorin had implied they did not exist.

Stevenson also attended several meetings of the EXCOMM at the White House during the Missile Crisis, where he boldly proposed to make an exchange with the Soviets: if they would remove their missiles from Cuba, the United States would agree to remove its obsolete Jupiter missiles from Turkey. However, he faced strong opposition from some other EXCOMM members, who regarded such an exchange as a sign of weakness. According to Kennedy adviser and Stevenson friend George W. Ball, who was present, these members &quot;intemperately upbraided Stevenson...[and were] outraged and shrill&quot;. However, President Kennedy remarked &quot;You have to admire Adlai, he sticks to his position even when everyone is jumping on him&quot;, and Robert Kennedy wrote that &quot;Stevenson has since been criticized for the position he took at the meeting...although I disagreed strongly with his recommendations, I thought he was courageous to make them, and I might add that they made as much sense as some others considered during that period of time.&quot; Stevenson remarked &quot;I know that most of those fellows will consider me a coward for the rest of my life for what I said today, but perhaps we need a coward in the room when we are talking about nuclear war.&quot; In fact, the Kennedy Administration did remove the Jupiter-class MRBMs from Italy and Turkey some six months after the Cuban Missile Crisis ended, and there is evidence that President Kennedy privately agreed that, if the Soviets would remove their missiles from Cuba, he would remove the Jupiter missiles from Turkey and Italy at a later date. The deal was kept a secret for many years, however, and Stevenson was thus given no credit for his original suggestion.

In December 1962 journalists Stewart Alsop and Charles Bartlett published an article about the Missile Crisis in the &quot;Saturday Evening Post.&quot; The article quoted a &quot;non-admiring official&quot; who claimed that Stevenson &quot;Wanted a Munich. He wanted to trade U.S. bases for Cuban bases&quot; and generally portrayed Stevenson&#x27;s behavior and actions during the Missile Crisis as weak and inept. Stevenson was deeply angered by the article, especially as it was widely believed that the &quot;non-admiring&quot; official who criticized Stevenson was President Kennedy himself – &quot;Kennedy had fed the Stevenson story to Alsop and Bartlett, partly because it enabled him to look strong&quot; in comparison to Stevenson. However, a number of Stevenson&#x27;s friends and supporters, such as historian and White House aide Arthur Schlesinger Jr., came to Stevenson&#x27;s defense. Schlesinger told Kennedy &quot;The suggestion in the Alsop-Bartlett story that Stevenson favored a Caribbean Munich is grossly unfair and shows the number of people who still have their knives out for him.&quot; Stevenson, knowing that Bartlett was a close friend of President Kennedy, assumed that the article had been written with Kennedy&#x27;s permission and let the president know through friends that if Kennedy had wanted him to resign, &quot;he did not have to go about it in such a roundabout fashion.&quot; Kennedy told Stevenson that he did not want him to resign and had his Press Secretary, Pierre Salinger, release a letter to the press praising Stevenson&#x27;s performance during the Missile Crisis. Although the letter did &quot;cause the public furor to die down... for months Washington continued to buzz over what everyone saw as an effort to force Adlai&#x27;s resignation&quot;, and Stevenson friend George Ball later said that the &quot;injury inflicted by the magazine article lingered on and on... After the Cuban Missile Crisis, Adlai was only going through the motions. From then on, he knew he was not going to have an impact on foreign policy.&quot;

===Kennedy assassination and Vietnam War===

During his time as UN ambassador, Stevenson often traveled around the country promoting the United Nations in speeches and seminars. On these trips, he frequently faced opposition and protests from groups skeptical of the United Nations, such as the right-wing John Birch Society. On October 25, 1963, Stevenson spoke in Dallas, Texas, where he was heckled and spat upon by unruly protestors led by retired General Edwin Walker&#x27;s &quot;National Indignation Convention&quot;. At one point a woman hit Stevenson on the head with a sign, leading Stevenson to remark &quot;is she animal or human?&quot;, and telling a policeman &quot;I don&#x27;t want her to go to jail, I want her to go to school.&quot; Afterwards, Stevenson warned President Kennedy&#x27;s advisers about the &quot;ugly and frightening&quot; mood he had found in Dallas, but he did not discuss his concerns directly with Kennedy before the president&#x27;s visit to Texas in late November 1963. On November 22, Stevenson was attending a luncheon held by the Chilean ambassador when he was informed that Kennedy had been shot in Dallas. He told friends and aides &quot;That Dallas! Why, why, didn&#x27;t I insist that he not go there?&quot;

After President Kennedy was assassinated, Stevenson continued to serve in his position as ambassador to the UN under President Lyndon Johnson. As the country moved toward the 1964 presidential election, the war in Vietnam became an important campaign issue. The Republican presidential candidate, Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater, advocated victory in Vietnam—a rollback strategy that Johnson denounced as tantamount to nuclear war. Stevenson was not a major player on the Vietnam issue. He did support Johnson publicly and in private because he believed in the containment of communism, but he also wanted to start negotiations with North Vietnam through the United Nations, which Johnson rejected.

==Death and legacy==
In July 1965, Stevenson traveled to Geneva, Switzerland, to attend the annual meeting of the United Nations Economic and Social Council. After the conference he stopped in London for several days, where he visited UK Prime Minister Harold Wilson, discussed the situation in South Vietnam with British officials, and was interviewed by CBS newsman Eric Sevareid. On the afternoon of July 14, while walking in London with his aide and girlfriend Marietta Tree to Grosvenor Square, Stevenson suffered a massive heart attack, and died later that day at age 65 of heart failure at St George&#x27;s Hospital. Marietta Tree recalled:

That night in her diary, she wrote, &quot;Adlai is dead. We were together.&quot; Following memorial services at the United Nations General Assembly Hall (on July 19, 1965), and in Washington, D.C.; Springfield, Illinois; and Bloomington, Illinois, Stevenson was interred in the family plot in Evergreen Cemetery, Bloomington, Illinois. The funeral in Bloomington&#x27;s Unitarian Church was attended by many national figures, including President Lyndon B. Johnson, Vice President Hubert Humphrey, and Chief Justice Earl Warren.
Historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., who served as one of his speechwriters, described Stevenson as a &quot;great creative figure in American politics. He turned the Democratic Party around in the fifties and made JFK possible...to the United States and the world he was the voice of a reasonable, civilized, and elevated America. He brought a new generation into politics, and moved millions of people in the United States and around the world.&quot;

Journalist David Halberstam wrote that &quot;Stevenson&#x27;s gift to the nation was his language, elegant and well-crafted, thoughtful and calming.&quot; His biographer Jean H. Baker stated that Stevenson&#x27;s memory &quot;still survives...as an expression of a different kind of politics – nobler, more issue-oriented, less compliant to the greedy ambitions of modern politicians, and less driven by public opinion polls and the media.&quot;

W. Willard Wirtz, his friend and law partner, once said &quot;If the Electoral College ever gives an honorary degree, it should go to Adlai Stevenson.&quot;

Halberstam wrote of Stevenson that

His biographer Jean H. Baker wrote of Stevenson&#x27;s two presidential campaigns in 1952 and 1956 that &quot;what would be remembered...were not his public programs and ideas for a New America but, ironically, the private man – his character and personality, his wit and charm, his efforts to negotiate and keep the peace within the Democratic Party, his elegant speeches, and the grace with which he accepted defeat.&quot;

The Central Illinois Regional Airport near Bloomington has a whimsical statue of Stevenson, sitting on a bench with his feet propped on his briefcase and his head in one hand, as if waiting for his flight. He is depicted wearing shoes that had a hole in the sole, from having walked many miles during his election campaign. The shoe had become a symbol of his campaign.

The Adlai E. Stevenson II Farm in Mettawa, Illinois, which was Stevenson&#x27;s home from 1936 to 1965, is on the National Register of Historic Places and has been designated a National Historic Landmark.

Adlai Stevenson II was inducted as a Laureate of The Lincoln Academy of Illinois and awarded the Order of Lincoln (the state&#x27;s highest honor) by the governor of Illinois in 1965 in the area of government.

In October 1965, the United States Post Office Department issued a 5 cent stamp in Bloomington, Illinois, to commemorate the life of Stevenson.

==Stevenson in popular culture==
=== In film and television ===
Stevenson has been referenced in television episodes of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; in the episodes &quot;Lisa the Iconoclast&quot; and &quot;The Secret War of Lisa Simpson&quot; (appearing in the latter in an educational film, with Harry Shearer providing the cartoon Stevenson&#x27;s voice. In the former, a gag occurs, as the mob of Springfielders exhume the corpse of Jedediah, Willie mistakenly throws dirt over the flame of a candle vigil set in front of Adlai&#x27;s grave).
He has also been referenced in &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;, &quot;Happy Days&quot; (in the January 28, 1975, episode &quot;The Not Making of the President&quot;) and &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;″s presentation of &quot;&quot; (a Stevenson lookalike buys a car and one of the MST3K characters comments on it). Murphy Brown briefly names her newborn son &#x27;Adlai Stevenson&#x27;. He was also mentioned in The West Wing (Arnold Vinick compares himself to Stevenson, the latter having been nominated twice to run for president)

Stevenson has also been referenced in films. Peter Sellers claimed that his portrayal of President Merkin Muffley in &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; was modeled on Stevenson. Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;&quot; speech to Russian ambassador Valerian Zorin during the Cuban Missile Crisis inspired dialogue in a courtroom scene in &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot;. The historical speech itself is depicted in the 2000 film &quot;Thirteen Days&quot; with Michael Fairman playing Stevenson, as well as partially depicted in the 1974 television play &quot;The Missiles of October&quot; by Ralph Bellamy. Stevenson is also referenced in &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World 2&quot; (&quot;Waynestock&quot; is held in an Aurora, Illinois, park named for Stevenson), &quot;Plain Clothes&quot; (the high school is named for Stevenson), &quot;Annie Hall&quot; (Woody Allen&#x27;s character tells a standup joke about the Stevenson-Eisenhower campaign) and &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot;. Stevenson also appears in &quot;A Global Affair&quot; credited as himself.

In &quot;Pioneer One&quot;, a crowd-financed TV series published under a Creative Commons license, one of the characters introduces himself as &quot;Adlai Steve DiLeo&quot;, named after Adlai Stevenson, &quot;someone who ran three times for president unsuccessfully&quot;.

In a parallel universe featured in the &quot;Sliders&quot; episode &quot;The Return of Maggie Beckett&quot;, the German Wehrmacht breaks through the Allied lines in the Battle of the Bulge in 1944, which causes World War II to drag on until 1947. General Eisenhower is relieved as the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Europe and returns to the United States in disgrace. Consequently, Stevenson becomes president. The Stevenson administration makes the Roswell UFO incident in July 1947 public knowledge and signs the Reticulan-American Free Trade Agreement (RAFTA), giving the US access to advanced Reticulan technology. This leads to a human mission to Mars in the 1990s.

In the 2016 movie &quot;Bogie and Bacall&quot;, Stevenson was portrayed by actor Ryan Paevey.

=== In alternate history and science fiction ===
Stevenson comes close to being assassinated by a 12-year-old in James Patrick Kelly&#x27;s Hugo Award-winning novelette &quot;1016 to 1&quot; (1999).

In Robin Gerber&#x27;s novel &quot;Eleanor vs. Ike&quot;, Stevenson suffers a fatal heart attack as he approaches the podium to accept the Democratic nomination in 1952. He is replaced as the Democratic presidential candidate by former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt.

In the alternate history short story &quot;The Impeachment of Adlai Stevenson&quot; by David Gerrold included in the anthology &quot;Alternate Presidents&quot;, Stevenson is elected in 1952 after Dwight D. Eisenhower makes the mistake of accepting Joseph McCarthy as his running mate instead of Richard Nixon. He successfully runs for re-election in 1956, once again defeating General Eisenhower. However, he proves to be an extremely unpopular president.

In Michael P. Kube-McDowell&#x27;s alternate history novel &quot;Alternities&quot;, Stevenson is mentioned as having been elected president in 1956 and serving for two terms, though he is quoted as describing his second term as a curse.

The alternate history novella &quot;Southern Strategy&quot; by Michael F. Flynn (&quot;Alternate Generals&quot;, volume two, Baen, 2002), is told entirely from Stevenson&#x27;s point of view. In a world where the Kaiser&#x27;s Germany is the leader of something resembling a free world in 1956, Stevenson is a former senator of the United States, which is in ruins after a Second American Civil War. The novella follows Stevenson&#x27;s increasingly futile efforts to negotiate an armistice between League of Nations peacekeepers led by General Erwin Rommel and several disparate guerrilla-terrorist bands with differing agendas. One of the terrorist bands is led by Richard Nixon.

In the alternate history novel &quot;Dominion&quot; by C. J. Sansom, World War II ends in June 1940 when the British government, under the leadership of the Prime Minister Lord Halifax, signs a peace treaty with Nazi Germany in Berlin. Franklin D. Roosevelt is steadfast in his opposition to the Nazis and the treaty, which results in him losing the 1940 election to his Republican opponent, Robert A. Taft, who becomes the 33rd president. Taft is re-elected in 1944 and 1948 but Stevenson defeats him in 1952, becoming the 34th President. Shortly after Stevenson&#x27;s election in November 1952, &quot;The Times&quot;, which is owned by the pro-Nazi British Prime Minister Lord Beaverbrook, speculates that Stevenson will follow in Roosevelt&#x27;s footsteps and pursue an interventionist foreign policy regarding European affairs. Several weeks later, President-elect Stevenson gives a speech indicating that he intends to begin trading with the Soviet Union upon taking office on January 20, 1953.

=== In other media ===
The writer Gore Vidal, who admired and supported Stevenson, based a main character in his 1960 Broadway play &quot;The Best Man&quot; on Stevenson. The play, which was nominated for six Tony Awards, centers on the contest for the presidential nomination at a fictitious political convention. One of the main contenders for the nomination is Secretary of State William Russell, a principled, liberal intellectual. The character is based on Stevenson; his main opponent is the ruthless, unscrupulous Senator Joseph Cantwell, whom Vidal modeled on Richard Nixon and the Kennedy brothers. The play was turned into a 1964 film of the same name, with actor Henry Fonda playing Russell. Fonda had been a Stevenson supporter at the 1960 Democratic National Convention.

&quot;The Avalanche: Outtakes and Extras from the Illinois Album&quot;, a 2006 album by Sufjan Stevens of songs about the state of Illinois, contains a song called &quot;Adlai Stevenson&quot;.

<text>Cádiz ( , , ) is a city in Spain and the capital of the Province of Cádiz, in the autonomous community of Andalusia. It is located in the southwest of the Iberian Peninsula off the Atlantic Ocean separated from neighbouring San Fernando by a narrow isthmus.

Cádiz, one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in Western Europe, was founded by the Phoenicians as a trading post. In the 18th century, the Port in the Bay of Cádiz consolidated as the main harbour of mainland Spain, enjoying the virtual monopoly of trade with the Americas until 1778. It is also the site of the University of Cádiz.

Situated on a narrow slice of land surrounded by the sea‚ Cádiz is, in most respects, a typical Andalusian city with well-preserved historical landmarks. The older part of Cádiz, within the remnants of the city walls, is commonly referred to as the Old Town (), and represents a large area of the total size of the city. It is characterized by the antiquity of its various quarters (), among them , , and , which present a marked contrast to the newer areas of town. While the Old City&#x27;s street plan consists of narrow winding alleys connecting large plazas, newer areas of Cádiz typically have wide avenues and more modern buildings. The city is dotted with parks where exotic plants flourish, including giant trees supposedly brought to the Iberian Peninsula from the New World. This includes the historic Parque Genovés.

==Names and etymology==


Numismatic inscriptions in the Phoenician language record that the Phoenicians knew the site as or (, ), meaning &#x27;wall&#x27;, &#x27;compound&#x27;, or (by metonymy) &#x27;stronghold&#x27;. Borrowed by the Berber languages, this became the &quot;agadir&quot; (Tamazight for &#x27;wall&#x27; and Shilha for &#x27;fortified granary&#x27;) common in North African place names, such as that of the Moroccan city of Agadir. The Carthaginians continued to use this name and all subsequent names have derived from it.

Attic Greek sources hellenized &quot;Gadir&quot; as (), which is neuter plural. Herodotus, using Ionic Greek, transcribed it a little differently, as (). Rarely, as in Stephanus of Byzantium&#x27;s notes on the writings of Eratosthenes, is the name given in the feminine singular form as ().

In Latin, the city was known as and its Roman colony as (&#x27;The August City of Julia of Cádiz&#x27;). In Arabic, the Latin name became (), from which the Spanish derives. The Spanish demonym for people and things from Cádiz is .

The same root also gives the modern Italian &quot;Càdice&quot;, Catalan &quot;Cadis&quot;, Portuguese &quot;Cádis&quot;, and French &quot;Cadix&quot;, the last also appearing in many English sources before the 20th century.

The name &quot;Cales&quot;, which usually refers to Calais in France, is also used for Cádiz, especially in the context of the 1596 Capture of Cádiz by the British and Dutch, as Thomas Percy notes in his introduction of the ballad &quot;The Winning of Cales&quot; (and it is also found in the sarcastic rhyme beginning &quot;A gentleman of Wales, a knight of Cales&quot;).

In English, the name &quot;Cádiz&quot;, traditionally spelt without the acute accent mark on the &quot;a&quot;, is pronounced variously. When the accent is on the second syllable, it is usually pronounced but, when the accent is on the first syllable, it may be pronounced as , , , and similar, typically in American English. In Spanish, the accent is always, as according to the spelling, on the first syllable but, while the usual pronunciation in Spain is , the local dialect says , or even instead.

==History==

=== Foundation and early history under the Phoenicians ===
Founded as &quot;Gadir&quot; or &quot;Agadir&quot; by Phoenicians from Tyre, Cádiz is often regarded as the most ancient city still standing in Western Europe. The city was an important trading hub founded to access different metals including gold, tin, and especially silver. The Phoenicians established a port in the 7th century BC.

Traditionally, Cádiz&#x27;s founding is dated to 1100 BC, although no archaeological strata on the site can be dated earlier than the 9th century BC. One resolution for this discrepancy has been to assume that Gadir was merely a small seasonal trading post in its earliest days.

Ancient Gadir occupied two small islands—primarily a settlement, and Kotinoussa, hosting cemeteries and sanctuaries outside the urban area—situated near the mouth of River Guadalete. Presently, these islands are interconnected. While the ancient ruins of Gadir beneath modern Cádiz&#x27;s historical center remain largely unexcavated, excavations have been carried out in the southern cemeteries.

By the 6th century BC, disturbances within Phoenicia itself, notably the fall of Tyre to the Babylonians (573 BC), led to the end of Phoenician control over southern Iberia. This vacuum was later filled by ancient Carthage, which rose as a predominant power in the region during subsequent eras.

=== Part of the Carthaginian Empire ===
The expeditions of Himilco around Spain and France and of Hanno around Western Africa began there. The Phoenician settlement traded with Tartessos, a city-state whose exact location remains unknown but is thought to have been somewhere near the mouth of the Guadalquivir River.

One of the city&#x27;s notable features during antiquity was the temple on the south end of its island dedicated to the Phoenician god Melqart, who was conflated with Hercules by the Greeks and Romans under the names &quot;Tyrian Hercules&quot; and &quot;Hercules Gaditanus&quot;. It had an oracle and was famed for its wealth. In Greek mythology, Hercules was sometimes credited with founding &quot;Gadeira&quot; after performing his tenth labor, the slaying of Geryon, a monster with three heads and torsos joined to a single pair of legs. (A tumulus near Gadeira was associated with Geryon&#x27;s final resting-place.) According to the &quot;Life of Apollonius of Tyana&quot;, the &quot;Heracleum&quot; (i.e., the temple of Melqart) was still standing during the 1st century. Some historians, based in part on this source, believe that the columns of this temple were the origin of the myth of the &quot;pillars of Hercules&quot;.

The city fell under the sway of Carthage during Hamilcar Barca&#x27;s Iberian campaign after the First Punic War. Cádiz became a depot for Hannibal&#x27;s conquest of southern Iberia, and he sacrificed there to Hercules/Melqart before setting off on his famous journey in 218 BC to cross the Alps and invade Italy. Later the city fell to Romans under Scipio Africanus in 206 BC.

=== Under Rome&#x27;s rule ===
Under the Roman Republic and Empire, the city flourished as a port and naval base known as &quot;Gades&quot;. Suetonius relates how Julius Caesar, when visiting Gades as a quaestor (junior senator), saw a statue of Alexander the Great there and was saddened to think that he himself, though the same age, had still achieved nothing memorable.

The people of Gades had an alliance with Rome and Julius Caesar bestowed Roman citizenship on all its inhabitants in 49 BC. By the time of Augustus&#x27;s census, Cádiz was home to more than five hundred &quot;equites&quot; (members of the wealthy upper class), a concentration rivaled only by Patavium (Padua) and Rome itself. It was the principal city of the Roman colony of Augusta Urbs Julia Gaditana. An aqueduct provided fresh water to the town, the island&#x27;s supply being poor, running across open sea for its last leg. However, Roman Gades was never very large. It consisted only of the northwest corner of the present island, and most of its wealthy citizens maintained estates outside of it on the nearby island or on the mainland. The lifestyle maintained on the estates led to the Gaditan dancing girls (the ) becoming famous throughout the ancient world.

Although it is not in fact the most westerly city in the Spanish peninsula, for the Romans Cádiz had that reputation. The poet Juvenal begins his famous tenth satire with the words: &quot;Omnibus in terris quae sunt a Gadibus usque Auroram et Gangen&quot; (&#x27;In all the lands which exist from Gades as far as Dawn and the Ganges ...&#x27;).

=== Switching hands in later antiquity ===
The overthrow of Roman power in Hispania Baetica by the Visigoths in the AD 400s saw the destruction of the original city, of which few traces remain today. The site was later reconquered by Justinian in 551 as part of the Byzantine province of Spania. It would remain Byzantine until Leovigild&#x27;s reconquest in 572 returned it to the Visigothic Kingdom.

=== Al-Andalus ===
Under Moorish rule between 711 and 1262, the city was called &quot;Qādis&quot;, whence the modern Spanish name was derived. A famous Muslim legend developed concerning an &quot;idol&quot; (&quot;sanam Qādis&quot;) over 100 cubits tall on the outskirts of Cádiz whose magic blocked the strait of Gibraltar with contrary winds and currents; its destruction by Abd-al-Mumin supposedly permitted ships to sail through the strait once more. It also appeared (as &quot;Salamcadis&quot;) in the 12th-century Pseudo-Turpin&#x27;s history of Charlemagne, where it was considered a statue of Muhammad and thought to warn the Muslims of Christian invasion. Classical sources are entirely silent on such a structure, but it has been conjectured that the origin of the legend was the ruins of a navigational aid constructed in late antiquity. Abd-al-Mumin (or Admiral Ali ibn-Isa ibn-Maymun) found that the idol was gilded bronze rather than pure gold, but coined what there was to help fund his revolt. In 1217, according to the &quot;De itinere Frisonum&quot; the city was raided by a group of Frisian crusaders en route to the Holy Land who burned it and destroyed its congregational mosque. The Moors were ousted by Alphonso X of Castile in 1262.

Historically, there was a Jewish community living in Cádiz under Muslim rule.

=== Post-1492 ===
During the Age of Exploration, the city experienced a renaissance. Christopher Columbus sailed from Cádiz on his second and fourth voyages and the city later became the home port of the Spanish treasure fleet. Consequently, it became a major target of Spain&#x27;s enemies. The 16th century saw a series of failed raids by Barbary corsairs; the greater part of the old town was consumed in a major fire in 1569; and in April 1587 a raid by the Englishman Francis Drake occupied the harbor for three days, captured six ships, and destroyed 31 others (an event which became known in England as &quot;the Singeing of the King of Spain&#x27;s Beard&quot;). The attack delayed the sailing of the Spanish Armada by a year.

The city suffered a still more serious attack in 1596, when it was captured by an Anglo-Dutch fleet, this time under the Earls of Essex and Nottingham. 32 Spanish ships were destroyed and the city was captured, looted and occupied for almost a month. Finally, when the royal authorities refused to pay a ransom demanded by the English for returning the city intact, they burned much of it before leaving with their booty. A third English raid was mounted against the city in 1625 by George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, and Edward Cecil, but the attempt was unsuccessful. During the Anglo-Spanish War, Admiral Robert Blake blockaded Cádiz from 1655 to 1657. In the 1702 Battle of Cádiz, the English attacked again under George Rooke and James Butler, 2nd Duke of Ormonde, but they were repelled after a costly siege.

In the 18th century, the sand bars of the Guadalquivir forced the Spanish government to transfer its American trade from Seville to Cádiz, which now commanded better access to the Atlantic. Although the empire itself was declining, Cádiz now experienced another golden age because of its new importance, and many of today&#x27;s historic buildings in the Old City date from this era. It became one of Spain&#x27;s greatest and most cosmopolitan cities and home to trading communities from many countries, chief among which were the French and Anglo-Irish. Irish Catholics were prohibited by the penal laws from owning land or entering a profession in Ireland, whereas in Spain they were as Catholics permitted to trade more freely than the English.

On 12 October 1778, the right to trade with the Americas was expanded to most ports of mainland Spain, bringing the monopoly of trade hitherto enjoyed by the Port of the Bay of Cádiz to an end.

During the Napoleonic Wars, Cádiz was blockaded by the British from 1797 until the Peace of Amiens in 1802 and again from 1803 until the outbreak of the Peninsular War in 1808. In that war, it was one of the few Spanish cities to hold out against the invading French and their candidate Joseph Bonaparte. Cádiz then became the seat of Spain&#x27;s military high command and Cortes (parliament) for the duration of the war. It was here that the liberal Spanish Constitution of 1812 was proclaimed. The citizens revolted in 1820 to secure a renewal of this constitution and the revolution spread successfully until Ferdinand VII was imprisoned in Cádiz. French forces secured the release of Ferdinand in the 1823 Battle of Trocadero and suppressed liberalism for a time. In 1868, Cádiz was once again the seat of a revolution, resulting in the eventual abdication and exile of Queen Isabella II. The Cortes of Cádiz decided to reinstate the monarchy under King Amadeo just two years later.

In recent years, the city has undergone much reconstruction. Many monuments, cathedrals, and landmarks have been cleaned and restored.

==Diocese==

The diocese of Cádiz and Ceuta is a suffragan of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Seville; that is, it is a diocese within the metropolitan see of Seville. It became a diocese in 1263 after its Reconquista (reconquest) from the Moors. By the Concordat of 1753, in which the Spanish crown also gained the rights to make appointments to church offices and to tax church lands, the Diocese of Cádiz was merged with the Diocese of Ceuta, a Spanish conclave on the northern coast of Africa, and the diocesan bishop became, by virtue of his office, the apostolic administrator of Ceuta.

==Main sights==

Among the many landmarks of historical and scenic interest in Cádiz, a few stand out. The city can boast of an unusual cathedral of various architectural styles, a theater, an old municipal building, an 18th-century watchtower, a vestige of the ancient city wall, an ancient Roman theater, and electrical pylons of an eye-catchingly modern design carrying cables across the Bay of Cádiz. The old town is characterized by narrow streets connecting squares (&quot;plazas&quot;), bordered by the sea and by the city walls. Most of the landmark buildings are situated in the plazas.

===Plazas and their landmark buildings===
The old town of Cádiz is one of the most densely populated urban areas in Europe, and is packed with narrow streets. The old town benefits, though, from several striking plazas, which are enjoyed by citizens and tourists alike. These are the &quot;Plaza de Mina&quot;, &quot;Plaza San Antonio&quot;, &quot;Plaza de Candelaria&quot;, &quot;Plaza de San Juan de Dios&quot;, and &quot;Plaza de España&quot;.

====Plaza de Mina====
Located in the heart of the old town, Plaza de Mina was developed in the first half of the 19th century. Previously, the land occupied by the plaza was the orchard of the convent of San Francisco. The plaza was converted into a plaza in 1838 by the architect Torcuato Benjumeda and (later) Juan Daura, with its trees being planted in 1861. It was then redeveloped again in 1897, and has remained virtually unchanged since that time. It is named after General Francisco Espoz y Mina, a hero of the war of independence. Manuel de Falla y Matheu was born in Number 3 Plaza de Mina, where a plaque bears his name. The plaza also contains several statues, one of these is a bust of José Macpherson (a pioneer in the development of petrography, stratigraphy and tectonics) who was born in number 12 Plaza de Mina in 1839. The Museum of Cádiz, is to be found at number 5 Plaza de Mina, and contains many objects from Cádiz&#x27;s 3000-year history as well as works by artists such as Peter Paul Rubens. The houses which face the plaza, many of which can be classified as neo-classical architecture or built in the style of Isabelline Gothic, were originally occupied by the Cádiz bourgeoisie.

The Plaza de la Catedral houses both the Cathedral and the Baroque church of &quot;Santiago&quot;, built in 1635.

====Plaza de San Francisco and San Francisco Church and Convent====
Located next to Plaza de Mina, this smaller square houses the San Francisco church and convent. Originally built in 1566, it was substantially renovated in the 17th century, when its cloisters were added. Originally, the Plaza de Mina formed the convent&#x27;s orchard.

====Plaza San Antonio====
In the 19th century Plaza San Antonio was considered to be Cádiz&#x27;s main square. The square is surrounded by a number of mansions built in neo-classical architecture or Isabelline Gothic style, once occupied by the Cádiz upper classes. San Antonio church, originally built in 1669, is also situated in the plaza.

The plaza was built in the 18th century, and on 19 March 1812 the Spanish Constitution of 1812 was proclaimed here, leading to the plaza to be named Plaza de la Constitución, and then later Plaza San Antonio, after the hermit San Antonio.

In 1954 the city&#x27;s mayor proclaimed the location a historic site. All construction is prohibited.

====Plaza de Candelaria====
The Plaza de Candelaria is named after the Candelaria convent, situated in the square until it was demolished in 1873 under the First Spanish Republic, when its grounds were redeveloped as a plaza. The plaza is notable for a statue in its centre of Emilio Castelar, president of the first Spanish republic, who was born in a house facing the square. A plaque situated on another house, states that Bernardo O&#x27;Higgins, an Irish-Chilean adventurer and former dictator of Chile, also lived in the square.

====Plaza de la Catedral and the Cathedral====
One of Cádiz&#x27;s most famous landmarks is its cathedral. Unlike in many places, the Cathedral of Cádiz, known locally as the &quot;New Cathedral,&quot; is officially the Cathedral de &quot;Santa Cruz sobre el mar&quot; or &quot;Santa Cruz sobre las Aguas&quot;. It was not built on the site of the original Cathedral de Santa Cruz. The latter was completed in 1263 at the behest of Alfonso X, and burned in the Anglo-Dutch attack on the city in 1596. The reconstruction of the old cathedral started in the early 17th century, but when the city became more prosperous following the move of the &quot;Casa de Contratación&quot; from Seville to Cádiz in 1717, it was felt that a grander cathedral was needed.

Work on the New Cathedral started in 1722 and was supervised by the architect Vicente Acero, who had also built the Granada Cathedral. Acero resigned from the project and was succeeded by several other architects. As a result, this largely Baroque-style cathedral was built over a period of 116 years, and, due to this drawn-out period of construction, the cathedral underwent several major changes to its original design. Though the cathedral was originally intended to be a baroque edifice with some rococo elements, it was completed in the neoclassical style. Its chapels have many paintings and relics from the old cathedral in Cádiz and as well as from monasteries throughout Spain.
====Plaza de San Juan de Dios and the Old Town Hall====
Construction of this plaza began in the 15th century on lands reclaimed from the sea. With the demolition of the City walls in 1906 the plaza increased in size and a statue of the Cádiz politician Segismundo Moret was unveiled. Overlooking the plaza, the &quot;Ayuntamiento&quot; is the town hall of Cádiz&#x27;s &quot;Old City&quot;. The structure, constructed on the bases and location of the previous Consistorial Houses (1699), was built in two stages. The first stage began in 1799 under the direction of architect Torcuato Benjumeda in the neoclassical style. The second stage was completed in 1861 under the direction of García del Alamo, in the Isabelline Gothic ( or, simply, the &quot;Isabelino&quot;) style. Here, in 1936, the flag of Andalusia was hoisted for the first time.

====Plaza de España and the monument to the constitution of 1812====

The Plaza de España is a large square close to the port. It is dominated by the Monument to the Constitution of 1812, which came into being as a consequence of the demolition of a portion of the old city wall. The plaza is an extension of the old Plazuela del Carbón.

The goal of this demolition was to create a grand new city square to mark the hundredth anniversary of the liberal constitution, which was proclaimed in this city in 1812, and provide a setting for a suitable memorial. The work is by the architect, Modesto Lopez Otero, and of the sculptor, Aniceto Marinas. The work began in 1912 and finished in 1929.

====Plaza Fragela and the Gran Teatro Falla (Falla Grand Theater)====
The original &quot;Gran Teatro&quot; was constructed in 1871 by the architect García del Alamo, and was destroyed by a fire in August 1881. The current theater was built between 1884 and 1905 over the remains of the previous Gran Teatro. The architect was Adolfo Morales de los Rios, and the overseer of construction was Juan Cabrera de la Torre. The outside was covered in red bricks and is of a neo-Mudéjar or Moorish revival style. Following renovations in the 1920s, the theater was renamed the &quot;Gran Teatro Falla&quot;, in honor of composer Manuel de Falla, who is buried in the crypt of the cathedral. After a period of disrepair in the 1980s, the theater has since undergone extensive renovation.
===Other sights===

====Tavira tower====
In the 18th century, Cádiz had more than 160 towers from which local merchants could look out to sea to watch for arriving merchant ships from the New World. These towers often formed part of the merchants&#x27; houses, but this particular tower was located on a high point in the city, 45 meters above sea level, and was chosen by the Navy as their official lookout in 1787 (after eliminating several other locations previously). The &quot;Torre Tavira&quot;, was named for its original watchman, Don Antonio Tavira, a lieutenant in the Spanish Navy. Today it is the tallest of the towers which still dot the Cádiz skyline. Since 1994 there is a &quot;camera obscura&quot;, a room that uses the principle of the pinhole camera and a specially prepared convex lens to project panoramic views of the Old City onto a concave disc. There are also two exhibition rooms and a rooftop terrace.

====Admiral&#x27;s House====
The &quot;Casa del Almirante&quot; is a palatial house, adjacent to the Plaza San Martín in the Barrio del Pópulo, which was constructed in 1690 with the proceeds of the lucrative trade with the Americas. It was built by the family of the admiral of the Spanish treasure fleet, the so-called Fleet of the Indies, Don Diego de Barrios. The exterior is sheathed in exquisite red and white Genoan marble, prepared in the workshops of Andreoli, and mounted by the master, García Narváez. The colonnaded portico, the grand staircase under the cupola, and the hall on the main floor are architectural features of great nobility and beauty. The shield of the Barrios family appears on the second-floor balcony.

====Old customs house====
Situated within the confines of the walls which protect the flank of the port of Cádiz are three identical adjacent buildings: the Customs House, the House of Hiring and the consulate. Of the three, the former had been erected first, built in a sober neo-classical style and of ample and balanced proportions. The works began in 1765 under the direction of Juan Caballero at a cost of 7,717,200 reales.

====Palacio de Congresos====
Cádiz&#x27;s refurbished tobacco factory offers international conference and trade-show facilities. Home to the third annual MAST Conference and trade-show (12 to 14 November 2008).

====Pylons of Cádiz====
The Pylons of Cádiz are electricity pylons of unusual design, one on either side of the Bay of Cádiz, used to support huge electric-power cables. The pylons are high and designed for two circuits. The very unconventional construction consists of a narrow frustum steel framework with one crossbar at the top of each one for the insulators.

====Roman theatre====

The Roman theatre was discovered in 1980, in the El Pópulo district, after a fire had destroyed some old warehouses, revealing a layer of construction that was judged to be the foundations of some medieval buildings; the foundations of these buildings had been built, in turn, upon much more ancient stones, hand-hewn limestone of a Roman character. Systematic excavations have revealed a largely intact Roman theatre.

The theatre, constructed by order of Lucius Cornelius Balbus (minor) during the 1st century BC, is the second-largest Roman theatre in the world, surpassed only by the theatre of Pompeii, south of Rome. Cicero, in his &quot;Epistulae ad Familiares&quot; (&#x27;Letters to his friends&#x27;), wrote of its use by Balbus for personal propaganda.

==== Carranza Bridge ====
====La Pepa Bridge====
La Pepa Bridge, officially &quot;La Pepa&quot; and also named the second bridge to Cádiz or new access to Cádiz. It opened 24 September 2015. It crosses the Bay of Cádiz linking Cádiz with Puerto Real in mainland Spain. It is the longest bridge in Spain and the longest span cable-stayed in the country.

The Constitution of 1812 Bridge, also known as La Pepa Bridge, is a new bridge across the Bay of Cádiz, linking Cádiz with the town of Puerto Real.

This is one of the highest bridges in Europe, with 5 kilometers in total length. It is the third access to the city, along with the San Fernando road and the Carranza bridge.
===City walls and fortifications===
&quot;Las Puertas de Tierra&quot; originated in the 16th century. Once consisting of several layers of walls, only one of these remain today. By the 20th century it was necessary to remodel the entrance to the Old City to accommodate modern traffic. Today, the two side-by-side arches cut into the wall serve as one of the primary entrances to the city.

&quot;El Arco de los Blancos&quot; is the gate to the Populo district, built around 1300. It was the principal gate to the medieval town. The gate is named after the family of Felipe Blanco who built a chapel (now disappeared) above the gate.

&quot;El Arco de la Rosa&quot; (&quot;Rose Arch&quot;) is a gate carved into the medieval walls next to the cathedral. It is named after captain Gaspar de la Rosa, who lived in the city during the 18th century. The gate was renovated in 1973.

The &quot;Baluarte de la Candelaria&quot; (fortress or stronghold of Candlemas) is a military fortification. Taking advantage of a natural elevation of land, it was constructed in 1672 at the initiative of the governor, Diego Caballero de Illescas. Protected by a seaward-facing wall that had previously served as a seawall, Candelaria&#x27;s cannons were in a position to command the channels approaching the port of Cádiz. In more recent times, the edifice has served as a headquarters for the corps of military engineers and as the home to the army&#x27;s homing pigeons, birds used to carry written messages over hostile terrain. Thoroughly renovated, it is now used as a cultural venue. There has been some discussion of using it to house a maritime museum, but, at present, it is designated for use as a permanent exposition space.

The &quot;Castle of San Sebastián&quot; is also a military fortification and is situated at the end of a road leading out from the Caleta beach. It was built in 1706. Today the castle remains unused, although its future uses remain much debated.

The &quot;Castle of Santa Catalina&quot; is also a military fortification, and is situated at the end of the Caleta beach. It was built in 1598 following the English sacking of Cádiz two years earlier. Recently renovated, today it is used for exhibitions and concerts.

==Climate==
Cádiz has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen &quot;Csa&quot;; Trewartha: &quot;Csal&quot;) with very mild winters and warm to hot summers. The city has significant maritime influences due to its position on a narrow peninsula. Cádiz has the warmest winters in Spain and one of the warmest in Europe, with an average temperature of in the coldest month. The annual sunshine hours of Cádiz are above 3,000h, being one of the sunniest cities in Europe. Although summer nights are tropical in nature, daytime temperatures are comparatively subdued compared to nearby inland areas such as Jerez and the very hot far inland areas in Andalucía. The average sea temperature is around during the winter and around during the summer. Snowfall is unknown at least since 1935.

==Beaches==
Cádiz, situated on a peninsula, is home to many beaches.

&quot;La Playa de la Caleta&quot; is the most popular beach of Cádiz. It has always been in Carnival songs, due to its unequalled beauty and its proximity to the &quot;Barrio de la Viña&quot;. It is the beach of the Old City, situated between two castles, San Sebastian and Santa Catalina. It is around long and wide at low tide. La Caleta and the boulevard show a lot of resemblance to parts of Havana, the capital city of Cuba, like the malecon. Therefore, it served as the set for several of the Cuban scenes in the beginning of the James Bond movie &quot;Die Another Day&quot;.

&quot;La Playa de la Victoria&quot;, in the newer part of Cádiz, is the beach most visited by tourists and natives of Cádiz. It is about three km long, and it has an average width of of sand. The moderate swell and the absence of rocks allow family bathing. It is separated from the city by an avenue; on the landward side of the avenue, there are many shops and restaurants.

&quot;La Playa de Santa María del Mar&quot; or &quot;Playita de las Mujeres&quot; is a small beach in Cádiz, situated between La Playa de Victoria and La Playa de la Caleta. It features excellent views of the old district of Cádiz.

Other beaches are &quot;Torregorda&quot;, &quot;Cortadura&quot; and &quot;El Chato&quot;.

==Culture==
=== Language ===
The Spanish spoken in Cádiz reflects features of Western Andalusian and urban dialects. It is &quot;seseante&quot;, meaning there is no distinction between the sounds of &quot;s&quot; and &quot;z,&quot; and the &quot;s&quot; is pronounced with the front part of the tongue (predorsal s). Key characteristics include:

* Aspiration of /s/ at the end of syllables (e.g., los amigos becomes [loh amigo]).

* Dropping /r/ at the end of syllables and aspirating /r/ when it comes before &quot;n&quot; or &quot;l&quot; (e.g., carne pronounced [kahne]).

* The /x/ sound (as in jamón) is usually pronounced as [h], a softer sound.

* Intervocalic /d/ (e.g., cansado) is often omitted (e.g., cansao).

* Occasionally, &quot;l&quot; is pronounced as &quot;r&quot; (rhotacism), though this is less common.

These features make the Cádiz accent unique, showcasing a strong influence of regional and urban speech patterns.

===Carnival===

The Carnival of Cádiz is one of the best known carnivals in the world. Throughout the year, carnival-related activities are almost constant in the city; there are always rehearsals, public demonstrations, and contests of various kinds.

The Carnival of Cádiz is famous for the satirical groups called &quot;chirigotas&quot;, who perform comical musical pieces. Typically, a chirigota is composed of seven to twelve performers who sing, act and improvise accompanied by guitars, kazoos, a bass drum, and a variety of noise-makers. Other than the chirigotas, there are many other groups of performers: choruses; ensembles called &quot;comparsas&quot;, who sing in close harmony much like the barbershop quartets of African-American culture or the mariachis of Mexico; &quot;cuartetos&quot;, consisting of four (or sometimes three) performers alternating dramatic parodies and humorous songs; and &quot;romanceros&quot;, storytellers who recite tales in verse. These diverse spectacles turn the city into a colourful and popular open-air theatre for two entire weeks in February.

The &quot;&quot; (the official association of carnival groups) sponsors a contest in the &quot;Gran Teatro Falla&quot; (see above) each year where chirigotas and other performers compete for prizes. This is the climactic event of the Cádiz carnival.
=== Cuisine ===
The gastronomy of Cádiz includes stews and sweets typical of the &quot;comarca&quot; and the city.
==Demographics==
According to a 2021 census estimate, the population of the city of Cádiz was 114,244 (the third-most-populated city of the province after Jerez de la Frontera, with 212,830 inhabitants, and Algeciras with 122,982). It is the only capital city in Spain that is not the most or second-most populated City on its province. Cádiz is the fifty-seventh-largest Spanish city. In recent years, the city&#x27;s population has steadily declined; it is the only municipality of the Bay of Cádiz (the &quot;comarca&quot; composed of Cádiz, Chiclana, El Puerto de Santa María, Puerto Real, and San Fernando), whose population has diminished. There are forecasts that Cádiz may become the fourth or fifth city in the province after losing more than 10,000 inhabitants from 2011 to 2021. Between 1995 and 2006, it lost more than 14,000 residents, a decrease of 9%.

Among the causes of this loss of population is the peculiar geography of Cádiz; the city lies on a narrow spit of land hemmed in by the sea. Consequently, there is a pronounced shortage of land to be developed. The city has very little vacant land, and a high proportion of its housing stock is relatively low in density. (That is to say, many buildings are only two or three stories tall, and they are only able to house a relatively small number of people within their &quot;footprint&quot;.) The older quarters of Cádiz are full of buildings that, because of their age and historical significance, are not eligible for urban renewal.

Two other physical factors tend to limit the city&#x27;s population. It is impossible to increase the amount of land available for building by reclaiming land from the sea; a new national law governing coastal development thwarts this possibility. Also, because Cádiz is built on a sandspit, it is a costly proposition to sink foundations deep enough to support the high-rise buildings that would allow for a higher population density. As it stands, the city&#x27;s skyline is not substantially different from in the Middle Ages. A 17th-century watchtower, the Tavira Tower, still commands a panoramic view of the city and the bay despite its relatively modest height. (See below.)

Cádiz is the provincial capital with the highest rate of unemployment in Spain. This, too, tends to depress the population level. Young Gaditanos, those between 18 and 30 years of age, have been migrating to other places in Spain (Madrid and Castellón, chiefly), as well as to other places in Europe and the Americas. The population younger than twenty years old is only 20.58% of the total, and the population older than sixty-five is 21.67%, making Cádiz one of the most aged cities in all of Spain.

===Population density===
The population distribution of the municipality is extremely uneven. In its inhabited areas, Cádiz is one of the most densely populated cities in Europe. The uninhabited Zona Franca industrial area, Bay of Cádiz Port Area, and Bay of Cádiz Natural Park occupy 63.63% of the municipal area. The entire city population lives in the remaining , at an average density close to 30,000 inhabitants per square kilometer. The city is divided for statistical purposes into 10 divisions, the most densely populated one having 39,592 inhabitants per square kilometer, the least having 20,835.

The table below lists the area, population, and population density of the ten statistical divisions of Cádiz. Divisions 1 to 7, the &quot;stats divisions&quot;, belong to the old town; 8, 9 and 10 correspond to the &quot;new city&quot;.


== Transportation ==

Cádiz is connected to European route E5 which connects it with Sevilla, Cordoba and Madrid to the North and Algeciras to the South East, continuing as E15 northbound along the Spanish Mediterranean coast.

The city is served by Jerez Airport, which is approximately 40 km (25 mi) north of the city centre. The airport offers regular domestic flights to Madrid and Barcelona as well as scheduled and seasonal charter flights to the UK, Germany and other European destinations. Cercanías Cádiz line C1 connects the airport to Cádiz main train station in 1hr.

Cádiz railway station is located just outside the old town. It offers suburban, regional and national services. The connection to the Madrid-Seville high-speed rail line was finished in 2015 after 14 years of construction, which extends the high speed Alvia trains to the city. Local services make the outskirts and regional destinations accessible along the line to Jerez and Seville. It is also the terminal of the new Cádiz Bay tram-train.

The port opposite the train station provides weekly ferry services to the Canary Islands (2–3 days travel time) as well as providing a stop for seasonal cruise ships.

<text>Hernando de Soto (; ; 1497 – 21 May 1542) was a Spanish explorer and &quot;conquistador&quot; who was involved in expeditions in Nicaragua and the Yucatan Peninsula. He played an important role in Francisco Pizarro&#x27;s conquest of the Inca Empire in Peru, but is best known for leading the first European expedition deep into the territory of the modern-day United States (through Florida, Georgia, Alabama, North Carolina, South Carolina, Mississippi, and most likely Arkansas). He is the first European documented as having crossed the Mississippi River.

De Soto&#x27;s North American expedition was a vast undertaking. It ranged throughout what is now the southeastern United States, searching both for gold, which had been reported by various Native American tribes and earlier coastal explorers, and for a passage to China or the Pacific coast. De Soto died in 1542 on the banks of the Mississippi River; sources disagree on the exact location, whether it was what is now Lake Village, Arkansas, or Ferriday, Louisiana.

== Early life ==
Hernando de Soto was born around the late 1490s or early 1500s in Extremadura, Spain, to parents who were both &quot;hidalgos&quot;, nobility of modest means. The region was poor and many people struggled to survive; young people looked for ways to seek their fortune elsewhere. He was born in the current province of Badajoz. Three towns—Badajoz, Barcarrota and Jerez de los Caballeros—each claim to be his birthplace. Historian Ursula Lamb writes that the Barcarrota claim can be traced to Inca Garcilaso de la Vega and is probably incorrect, having been written down 45 years after De Soto&#x27;s death. According to Lamb, his birthplace is most likely Jerez de los Caballeros. Although he spent time as a child at each place, De Soto stipulated in his will that his body be interred at Jerez de los Caballeros, where other members of his family were buried.

A few years before his birth, the Kingdoms of Castille and Aragon conquered the last Islamic kingdom of the Iberian Peninsula. Spain and Portugal were filled with young men seeking a chance for military fame after the defeat of the Moors. With Christopher Columbus&#x27;s discovery of new lands (which he thought to be East Asia) across the ocean to the west, young men were attracted to rumors of adventure, glory and wealth.

==In the New World==
De Soto sailed to the New World with Pedro Arias Dávila, appointed as the first Governor of Panama. In 1520 he participated in Gaspar de Espinosa&#x27;s expedition to Veragua, and in 1524, he participated in the conquest of Nicaragua under Francisco Hernández de Córdoba. There he acquired an &quot;encomienda&quot; and a public office in León, Nicaragua.
Brave leadership, unwavering loyalty, and ruthless schemes for the extortion of native villages for their captured chiefs became de Soto&#x27;s hallmarks during the conquest of Central America. He gained fame as an excellent horseman, fighter, and tactician. During that time, de Soto was influenced by the achievements of Iberian explorers: Juan Ponce de León, the first European to reach Florida; Vasco Núñez de Balboa, the first European to reach the Pacific Ocean coast of the Americas (he called it the &quot;South Sea&quot; on the south coast of Panama); and Ferdinand Magellan, who first sailed that ocean to East Asia.
In 1530, de Soto became a &quot;regidor&quot; of León, Nicaragua. He led an expedition up the coast of the Yucatán Peninsula searching for a passage between the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean to enable trade with the Orient, the richest market in the world. Failing that, and without means to explore further, de Soto, upon Pedro Arias Dávila&#x27;s death, left his estates in Nicaragua. Bringing his own men on ships which he hired, de Soto joined Francisco Pizarro at his first base of Tumbes shortly before departure for the interior of present-day Peru.
 Pizarro quickly made de Soto one of his captains.

== Conquest of Peru ==
When Pizarro and his men first encountered the army of Inca Atahualpa at Cajamarca, Pizarro sent de Soto with fifteen men to invite Atahualpa to a meeting. When Pizarro&#x27;s men attacked Atahualpa and his guard the next day (the Battle of Cajamarca), de Soto led one of the three groups of mounted soldiers. The Spanish captured Atahualpa. De Soto was sent to the camp of the Inca army, where he and his men plundered Atahualpa&#x27;s tents.

During 1533, the Spanish held Atahualpa captive in Cajamarca for months while his subjects paid for his ransom by filling a room with gold and silver objects. During this captivity, de Soto became friendly with Atahualpa and taught him to play chess. By the time the ransom had been completed, the Spanish became alarmed by rumors of an Inca army advancing on Cajamarca. Pizarro sent de Soto with 200 soldiers to scout for the rumored army.

While de Soto was gone, the Spanish in Cajamarca decided to kill Atahualpa to prevent his rescue. De Soto returned to report that he found no signs of an army in the area. After executing Atahualpa, Pizarro and his men headed to Cuzco, the capital of the Incan Empire. As the Spanish force approached Cuzco, Pizarro sent his brother Hernando and de Soto ahead with 40 men. The advance guard fought a pitched battle with Inca troops in front of the city, but the battle had ended before Pizarro arrived with the rest of the Spanish party. The Inca army withdrew during the night. The Spanish plundered Cuzco, where they found much gold and silver. As a mounted soldier, de Soto received a share of the plunder, which made him very wealthy. It represented riches from Atahualpa&#x27;s camp, his ransom, and the plunder from Cuzco.

On the road to Cuzco, Manco Inca Yupanqui, a brother of Atahualpa, had joined Pizarro. Manco had been hiding from Atahualpa in fear of his life, and was happy to gain Pizarro&#x27;s protection. Pizarro arranged for Manco to be installed as the Inca leader. De Soto joined Manco in a campaign to eliminate the Inca armies under Quizquiz, a general who had been loyal to Atahualpa.

By 1534, de Soto was serving as lieutenant governor of Cuzco while Pizarro was building his new capital on the coast; it later became known as Lima. In 1535 King Charles awarded Diego de Almagro, Francisco Pizarro&#x27;s partner, the governorship of the southern portion of the Inca Empire. When de Almagro made plans to explore and conquer the southern part of the Inca empire (now Chile), de Soto applied to be his second-in-command, but de Almagro turned him down. De Soto packed up his treasure and returned to Spain.

== Return to Spain ==
De Soto returned to Spain in 1536, with wealth gathered from plunder in the Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire. He was admitted into the prestigious Order of Santiago and &quot;granted the right to conquer Florida&quot;. His share was awarded to him by the King of Spain, and he received 724 marks of gold, and 17,740 pesos. He married Isabel de Bobadilla, daughter of Pedrarias Dávila and a relative of a confidante of Queen Isabella.

De Soto petitioned King Charles to lead the government of Guatemala, with &quot;permission to create discovery in the South Sea.&quot; He was granted the governorship of Cuba instead. De Soto was expected to colonize the North American continent for Spain within 4 years, for which his family would be given a sizable piece of land.

Fascinated by the stories of Cabeza de Vaca, who had survived years in North America after becoming a castaway and had just returned to Spain, de Soto selected 620 Spanish and Portuguese volunteers, including some of mixed-race African descent known as Atlantic Creoles, to accompany him to govern Cuba and colonize North America. Averaging 24 years of age, the men embarked from Havana on seven of the King&#x27;s ships and two caravels of de Soto&#x27;s. With tons of heavy armor and equipment, they also carried more than 500 head of livestock, including 237 horses and 200 pigs, for their planned four-year continental expedition.

De Soto wrote a new will upon arriving in what is now the Tampa Bay area of Florida. On 10 May 1539, he wrote in his will:

That a chapel be erected within the Church of San Miguel in Jerez de Los Caballeros, Spain, where De Soto grew up, at a cost of 2,000 ducats, with an altarpiece featuring the Virgin Mary, Our Lady of the Conception, that his tomb be covered in a fine black broadcloth topped by a red cross of the Order of the Knights of Santiago, and on special occasions a pall of black velvet with the De Soto coat of arms be placed on the altar; that a chaplain be hired at the salary of 12,000 maravedis to perform five masses every week for the souls of De Soto, his parents, and wife; that thirty masses be said for him the day his body was interred, and twenty for our Lady of the Conception, ten for the Holy Ghost, sixty for souls in purgatory and masses for many others as well; that 150000 maravedis be given annually to his wife Isabel for her needs and an equal amount used yearly to marry off three orphan damsels...the poorest that can be found,&quot; to assist his wife and also serve to burnish the memory of De Soto as a man of charity and substance.

== De Soto&#x27;s exploration of North America ==
=== Historiography ===
Historians have worked to trace the route of de Soto&#x27;s expedition in North America, a controversial process over the years. Local politicians vied to have their localities associated with the expedition. The most widely used version of &quot;De Soto&#x27;s Trail&quot; comes from a study commissioned by the United States Congress. A committee chaired by the anthropologist John R. Swanton published &quot;The Final Report of the United States De Soto Expedition Commission&quot; in 1939. Among other locations, Manatee County, Florida, claims an approximate landing site for de Soto and has a national memorial recognizing that event. In the early 21st century, the first part of the expedition&#x27;s course, up to de Soto&#x27;s battle at Mabila (a small fortress town in present-day central Alabama), is disputed only in minor details. His route beyond Mabila is contested. Swanton reported the de Soto trail ran from there through Mississippi, Arkansas, and Texas.

Historians have more recently considered archeological reconstructions and the oral history of the various Native American peoples who recount the expedition. Most historical places have been overbuilt and much evidence has been lost. More than 450 years have passed between the events and current history tellers, but some oral histories have been found to be accurate about historic events that have been otherwise documented.

The Governor Martin Site at the former Apalachee village of Anhaica, located about a mile east of the present-day Florida state capitol in Tallahassee, has been documented as definitively associated with de Soto&#x27;s expedition. The Governor Martin Site was discovered by archaeologist B. Calvin Jones in March 1987. It has been preserved as the DeSoto Site Historic State Park.

The Hutto/Martin Site, 8MR3447, in southeastern Marion County, Florida, on the Ocklawaha River, is the most likely site of the principal town of &quot;Acuera&quot; referred to in the accounts of the &quot;entrada&quot;, as well as the site of the seventeenth-century mission of Santa Lucia de Acuera.

As of 2016, the Richardson/UF Village site (8AL100) in Alachua County, west of Orange Lake, appears to have been accepted by archaeologists as the site of the town of Potano visited by the de Soto expedition. The 17th-century mission of San Buenaventura de Potano is believed to have been founded here.

Many archaeologists believe the Parkin Archeological State Park in northeast Arkansas was the main town for the indigenous province of Casqui, which de Soto had recorded. They base this on similarities between descriptions from the journals of the de Soto expedition and artifacts of European origin discovered at the site in the 1960s.

Theories of de Soto&#x27;s route are based on the accounts of four chroniclers of the expedition.

* The first account of the expedition to be published was by the Gentleman of Elvas, an otherwise unidentified Portuguese knight who was a member of the expedition. His chronicle was first published in 1557. An English translation by Richard Hakluyt was published in 1609.
* Luys Hernández de Biedma, the King&#x27;s factor (the agent responsible for the royal property) with the expedition, wrote a report which still exists. The report was filed in the royal archives in Spain in 1544. The manuscript was translated into English by Buckingham Smith and published in 1851.
* De Soto&#x27;s secretary, Rodrigo Ranjel, kept a diary, which has been lost. It was apparently used by Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés in writing his &quot;La historia general y natural de las Indias&quot;. Oviedo died in 1557. The part of his work containing Ranjel&#x27;s diary was not published until 1851. An English translation of Ranjel&#x27;s report was first published in 1904.
* The fourth chronicle is by Garcilaso de la Vega, known as &quot;El Inca&quot; (the Inca). Garcilaso de la Vega did not participate in the expedition. He wrote his account, &quot;La Florida&quot;, known in English as &quot;The Florida of the Inca&quot;, decades after the expedition, based on interviews with some survivors of the expedition. The book was first published in 1605. Historians have identified problems with using &quot;La Florida&quot; as a historical account. Milanich and Hudson warn against relying on Garcilaso, noting serious problems with the sequence and location of towns and events in his narrative. They say, &quot;some historians regard Garcilaso&#x27;s &quot;La Florida&quot; to be more a work of literature than a work of history.&quot; Lankford characterizes Garcilaso&#x27;s &quot;La Florida&quot; as a collection of &quot;legend narratives&quot;, derived from a much-retold oral tradition of the survivors of the expedition.

Milanich and Hudson warn that older translations of the chronicles are often &quot;relatively free translations in which the translators took considerable liberty with the Spanish and Portuguese text.&quot;

The chronicles describe de Soto&#x27;s trail in relation to Havana, from which they sailed; the Gulf of Mexico, which they skirted while traveling inland then turned back to later; the Atlantic Ocean, which they approached during their second year; high mountains, which they traversed immediately thereafter; and dozens of other geographic features along their way, such as large rivers and swamps, at recorded intervals. Given that the natural geography has not changed much since de Soto&#x27;s time, scholars have analyzed those journals with modern topographic intelligence, to develop a more precise account of the De Soto Trail.

=== 1539: Florida ===
In May 1539, de Soto landed nine ships with over 620 men and 220 horses in an area generally identified as south Tampa Bay. Historian Robert S. Weddle has suggested that he landed at either Charlotte Harbor or San Carlos Bay. He named the land as &quot;Espíritu Santo&quot;, after the Holy Spirit. The ships carried priests, craftsmen, engineers, farmers, and merchants; some with their families, some from Cuba, most from Europe and Africa. Few of the men had traveled before outside of Spain, or even away from their home villages.

Near de Soto&#x27;s port, the party found Juan Ortiz, a Spaniard living with the Mocoso people. Ortiz had been captured by the Uzita while searching for the lost Narváez expedition; he later escaped to Mocoso. Ortiz had learned the Timucua language and served as an interpreter to de Soto as he traversed the Timucuan-speaking areas on his way to Apalachee.

Ortiz developed a method for guiding the expedition and communicating with the various tribes, who spoke many dialects and languages. He recruited guides from each tribe along the route. A chain of communication was established whereby a guide who had lived in close proximity to another tribal area was able to pass his information and language on to a guide from a neighboring area. Because Ortiz refused to dress as a &quot;hidalgo&quot; Spaniard, other officers questioned his motives. De Soto remained loyal to Ortiz, allowing him the freedom to dress and live among his native friends. Another important guide was the seventeen-year-old boy &quot;Perico&quot;, or Pedro, from what is now Georgia. He spoke several of the local tribes&#x27; languages and could communicate with Ortiz. Perico was taken as a guide in 1540. The Spanish had also captured other Indians, whom they used as slave labor. Perico was treated better due to his value to the Spaniards.

The expedition traveled north, exploring Florida&#x27;s West Coast, and encountering native ambushes and conflicts along the way. Hernando de Soto&#x27;s army seized the food stored in the villages, captured women to be used as slaves for the soldiers&#x27; sexual gratification, and forced men and boys to serve as guides and bearers. The army fought two battles with Timucua groups, resulting in heavy Timucua casualties. After defeating the resisting Timucuan warriors, Hernando de Soto had 200 executed, in what was to be called the Napituca Massacre, the first large-scale massacre by Europeans in the current United States. One of Soto’s most important battles with the natives, along his conquest of Florida, was a 1539 battle with Chief Vitachuco. Unlike other native chiefs who entered into peace with the Spanish, Vitachuco did not trust them and had secretly plotted to kill Soto and his army, but he was betrayed by interpreters who told Soto the plan. So, Soto struck first and, in the process, killed thousands of natives. Those that survived were surrounded and cornered by woods and water. Thousands were killed during the 3 hours battle and 900 survivors took refuge in the pond, specifically Two-mile Pond in Melrose, where they continued to fight, while swimming. Most eventually surrendered, but after 30 hours in the water, 7 men remained and had to be dragged out of the water by the Spanish. De Soto&#x27;s first winter encampment was at &quot;Anhaica&quot;, the capital of the Apalachee people. It is one of the few places on the route where archaeologists have found physical traces of the expedition. The chroniclers described this settlement as being near the &quot;Bay of Horses&quot;. The bay was named for events of the 1527 Narváez expedition, the members of which, dying of starvation, killed and ate their horses while building boats for escape by the Gulf of Mexico.

=== 1540: The Southeast ===
From their winter location in the western panhandle of Florida, having heard of gold being mined &quot;toward the sun&#x27;s rising&quot;, the expedition turned northeast through what is now the modern state of Georgia. Based on archaeological finds made in 2009 at a remote, privately owned site near the Ocmulgee River, researchers believe that de Soto&#x27;s expedition stopped in Telfair County. Artifacts found here include nine glass trade beads, some of which bear a chevron pattern made in Venice for a limited period of time and believed to be indicative of the de Soto expedition. Six metal objects were also found, including a silver pendant and some iron tools. The rarest items were found within what researchers believe was a large council house of the indigenous people whom de Soto was visiting.

The expedition continued to present-day South Carolina. There the expedition recorded being received by a female chief (&quot;The Lady of Cofitachequi&quot;), who gave her tribe&#x27;s pearls, food and other goods to the Spanish soldiers. The expedition found no gold, however, other than pieces from an earlier coastal expedition (presumably that of Lucas Vázquez de Ayllón.)
De Soto headed north into the Appalachian Mountains of present-day western North Carolina, where he spent a month resting the horses while his men searched for gold. De Soto next entered eastern Tennessee. At this point, de Soto either continued along the Tennessee River to enter Alabama from the north (according to John R. Swanton), or turned south and entered northern Georgia (according to Charles M. Hudson). Swanton&#x27;s final report, published by the Smithsonian, remains an important resource but Hudson&#x27;s reconstruction of the route was conducted 40 years later and benefited from considerable advances in archaeological methods.

De Soto&#x27;s expedition spent another month in the Coosa chiefdom a vassal to Tuskaloosa, who was the paramount chief, believed to have been connected to the large and complex Mississippian culture, which extended throughout the Mississippi Valley and its tributaries. De Soto turned south toward the Gulf of Mexico to meet two ships bearing fresh supplies from Havana. De Soto demanded women and servants, and when Tuskaloosa refused, the European explorers took him hostage. The expedition began making plans to leave the next day, and Tuskaloosa gave in to de Soto&#x27;s demands, providing bearers for the Spaniards. He informed de Soto that they would have to go to his town of &quot;Mabila&quot; (or &quot;Mauvila&quot;), a fortified city in southern Alabama, to receive the women. De Soto gave the chief a pair of boots and a red cloak to reward him for his cooperation. The Mobilian tribe, under chief Tuskaloosa, ambushed de Soto&#x27;s army. Other sources suggest de Soto&#x27;s men were attacked after attempting to force their way into a cabin occupied by Tuskaloosa. The Spaniards fought their way out, and retaliated by burning the town to the ground. During the nine-hour encounter, about 200 Spaniards died, and 150 more were badly wounded, according to the chronicler Elvas. Twenty more died during the next few weeks. They killed an estimated 2,000–6,000 Native Americans at Mabila, making the battle one of the bloodiest in recorded North American history.

The Spaniards won a Pyrrhic victory, as they had lost most of their possessions and nearly one-quarter of their horses. The Spaniards were wounded and sickened, surrounded by enemies and without equipment in an unknown territory. Fearing that word of this would reach Spain if his men reached the ships at Mobile Bay, de Soto led them away from the Gulf Coast. He moved into inland Mississippi, most likely near present-day Tupelo, where they spent the winter.

=== 1541: Westward ===
In the spring of 1541, de Soto demanded 200 men as porters from the Chickasaw. They refused his demand and attacked the Spanish camp during the night.

On 8 May 1541, de Soto&#x27;s troops reached the Mississippi River.

De Soto had little interest in the river, which in his view was an obstacle to his mission. There has been considerable research into the exact location where de Soto crossed the Mississippi River. A commission appointed by Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1935 determined that Sunflower Landing, Mississippi, was the &quot;most likely&quot; crossing place. De Soto possibly traveled down Charley&#x27;s Trace, which had been used as a trail through the swamps of the Mississippi Delta, to reach the Mississippi River. De Soto and his men spent a month building flatboats, and crossed the river at night to avoid the Native Americans who were patrolling the river. De Soto had hostile relations with the native people in this area.

In the late 20th century, research suggests other locations may have been the site of de Soto&#x27;s crossing, including three locations in Mississippi: Commerce, Friars Point, and Walls, as well as Memphis, Tennessee. Once across the river, the expedition continued traveling westward through modern-day Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. They wintered in &quot;Autiamique&quot;, on the Arkansas River.

After a harsh winter, the Spanish expedition decamped and moved on more erratically. Their interpreter Juan Ortiz had died, making it more difficult for them to get directions and food sources, and generally to communicate with the Natives. The expedition went as far inland as the Caddo River, where they clashed with a Native American tribe called the Tula in October 1541. The Spaniards characterized them as the most skilled and dangerous warriors they had encountered. This may have happened in the area of present-day Caddo Gap, Arkansas (a monument to the de Soto expedition was erected in that community). Eventually, the Spaniards returned to the Mississippi River.

=== Death ===

De Soto died of a fever on 21 May 1542, in the native village of &quot;Guachoya.&quot; Historical sources disagree as to whether de Soto died near present-day Lake Village, Arkansas McArthur, Arkansas, or Ferriday, Louisiana. Louisiana erected a historical marker at the conjectured site on the western bank of the Mississippi River.

Before his death, de Soto chose Luis de Moscoso Alvarado, his former maestro de campo (or field commander), to assume command of the expedition. At the time of death, de Soto owned four Indian slaves, three horses, and 700 hogs.

De Soto had deceived the local natives into believing that he was a deity, specifically an &quot;immortal Son of the Sun,&quot; to gain their submission without conflict. Some of the natives had already become skeptical of de Soto&#x27;s deity claims, so his men were anxious to conceal his death. The actual site of his burial is not known. According to one source, de Soto&#x27;s men hid his corpse in blankets weighted with sand and sank it in the middle of the Mississippi River during the night.

=== Return of the expedition to Mexico City ===

De Soto&#x27;s expedition had explored &quot;La Florida&quot; for three years without finding the expected treasures or a hospitable site for colonization. They had lost nearly half their men, and most of the horses. By this time, the soldiers were wearing animal skins for clothing. Many were injured and in poor health. The leaders came to a consensus (although not total) to end the expedition and try to find a way home, either down the Mississippi River, or overland across Texas to the Spanish colony of Mexico City.

They decided that building boats would be too difficult and time-consuming and that navigating the Gulf of Mexico was too risky, so they headed overland to the southwest. Eventually, they reached a region in present-day Texas that was dry. The native populations were made up mostly of subsistence hunter-gatherers. The soldiers found no villages to raid for food, and the army was still too large to live off the land. They were forced to backtrack to the more developed agricultural regions along the Mississippi, where they began building seven &quot;bergantines&quot;, or pinnaces. They melted down all the iron, including horse tackle and slave shackles, to make nails for the boats. They survived through the winter, and the spring floods delayed them another two months. By July they set off on their makeshift boats down the Mississippi for the coast.

Taking about two weeks to make the journey, the expedition encountered hostile fleets of war canoes along the whole course. The first was led by the powerful paramount chief &quot;Quigualtam&quot;, whose fleet followed the boats, shooting arrows at the soldiers for days as they drifted through their territory. The Spanish had no effective offensive weapons on the water, as their crossbows had long since ceased working. They relied on armor and sleeping mats to block the arrows. About 11 Spaniards were killed along this stretch and many more wounded.

On reaching the mouth of the Mississippi, they stayed close to the Gulf shore heading south and west. After about 50 days, they made it to the Pánuco River and the Spanish frontier town of Pánuco. There they rested for about a month. During this time many of the Spaniards, having safely returned and reflecting on their accomplishments, decided they had left &quot;La Florida&quot; too soon. There were some fights within the company, leading to some deaths. But, after they reached Mexico City and the Viceroy Don Antonio de Mendoza offered to lead another expedition to &quot;La Florida&quot;, few of the survivors volunteered. Of the recorded 700 participants at the start, between 300 and 350 survived (311 is a commonly accepted figure). Most of the men stayed in the New World, settling in Mexico, Peru, Cuba, and other Spanish colonies.

== Effects of expedition in North America ==

The Spanish believed that de Soto&#x27;s excursion to Florida was a failure. They acquired neither gold nor prosperity and founded no colonies. But the expedition had several major consequences.

It contributed to the process of the Columbian Exchange. For instance, some of the swine brought by de Soto escaped and became the ancestors of feral razorback pigs in the southeastern United States.

De Soto was instrumental in contributing to the development of a hostile relationship between many Native American tribes and Europeans. When his expedition encountered hostile natives in the new lands, more often than not it was his men who instigated the clashes.

More devastating than the battles were the diseases which may have been carried by the members of the expedition. Because the indigenous people lacked the immunity which the Europeans had acquired through generations of exposure to these Eurasian diseases, the Native Americans may have suffered epidemics of illness after exposure to such diseases as measles, smallpox, and chicken pox. Several areas traversed by the expedition became depopulated, potentially by disease caused by contact with the Europeans. Seeing the high fatalities and devastation caused, many natives would have fled the populated areas for the surrounding hills and swamps. In some areas, the social structure would have changed because of high population losses due to epidemics. However, recent scholars have begun to question whether the expedition brought novel disease at all. The arrival of many diseases, aside from malaria, is disputed and they may not have entered the region until much later. The first documented smallpox epidemic in the southeast arrived in 1696, and Mississippian social structures persisted in some parts of the region until the 18th century. 

The records of the expedition contributed greatly to European knowledge about the geography, biology, and ethnology of the New World. The de Soto expedition&#x27;s descriptions of North American natives are the earliest-known source of information about the societies in the Southeast. They are the only European description of the culture and habits of North American native tribes before these peoples encountered other Europeans. De Soto&#x27;s men were both the first and nearly the last Europeans to witness the villages and civilization of the Mississippian culture.

De Soto&#x27;s expedition led the Spanish crown to reconsider Spain&#x27;s attitude toward the colonies north of Mexico. He claimed large parts of North America for Spain.

<text>The Rum Rebellion of 1808 was a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; in the British penal colony of New South Wales, staged by the New South Wales Corps in order to depose Governor William Bligh. Australia&#x27;s first and only military coup, its name derives from the illicit rum trade of early Sydney, over which the &#x27;Rum Corps&#x27;, as it became known, maintained a monopoly. During the first half of the 19th century, it was widely referred to in Australia as the Great Rebellion.

Bligh, a former Royal Navy captain known for his overthrow in the mutiny on the &quot;Bounty&quot;, had been appointed governor in 1805 to rein in the power of the Corps. Over the next two years, Bligh made enemies not only of Sydney&#x27;s military elite, but several prominent civilians, notably John Macarthur, who joined Major George Johnston in organising an armed takeover. On 26 January 1808, 400 soldiers marched on Government House and arrested Bligh. He was kept in confinement in Sydney, then aboard a ship off Hobart, Van Diemen&#x27;s Land, for the next two years while Johnston acted as Lieutenant-Governor of New South Wales. The military remained in control until the 1810 arrival from Britain of Major-General Lachlan Macquarie, who took over as governor.

==Bligh&#x27;s appointment as governor==
William Bligh succeeded Philip Gidley King. Bligh was well known for his overthrow in the mutiny on the &quot;Bounty&quot;. It is likely that he was deliberately selected by the British government because of his reputation as a &quot;hard man&quot; and was expected to have a good chance of reining in the maverick New South Wales Corps; something that his predecessors had not been able to do. Bligh left for Sydney with his daughter, Mary Putland, and her husband, Lieutenant John Putland, while Bligh&#x27;s wife remained in England.

Even before his arrival, Bligh&#x27;s style of governance led to problems with his subordinates. The Admiralty gave command of the storeship and the convoy to the lower-ranked Captain Joseph Short, while Bligh took command of a transport ship. This led to quarrels which eventually resulted in Captain Short firing across Bligh&#x27;s bow in an attempt to force Bligh to obey his signals. When this failed, Short tried to give an order to Lieutenant Putland to stand by to fire on Bligh&#x27;s ship. Bligh boarded &quot;Porpoise&quot; and seized control of the convoy.

When they arrived in Sydney, Bligh, backed up by statements from two of Short&#x27;s officers, had Short stripped of the captaincy of &quot;Porpoise&quot; – which he gave to his son-in-law, cancelled the land grant Short had been promised as payment for the voyage, and shipped him back to England for court-martial. Short was acquitted. The president of the court, Sir Isaac Coffin, wrote to the Admiralty and made several serious accusations against Bligh, including that he had influenced the officers to testify against Short. Bligh&#x27;s wife obtained a statement from one of the officers denying this, and Banks and other supporters of Bligh lobbied successfully against his recall as governor.

===Arrival in Sydney===

Soon after his arrival at Sydney, in August 1806, Bligh was given an address of welcome signed by Major George Johnston for the military, by Richard Atkins for the civilian officers, and by John Macarthur for the free settlers. However, not long after, Bligh also received addresses from the free and freed settlers of Sydney and the Hawkesbury River region, with a total of 369 signatures, many made only with a cross, complaining that Macarthur did not represent them. They blamed him for withholding sheep so as to raise the price of mutton.

One of Bligh&#x27;s first actions was to use the colony&#x27;s stores and herds to provide relief to farmers who had been severely affected by flooding on the Hawkesbury River, a situation that had disrupted the barter economy in the colony. Supplies were divided according to those most in need, and provisions were made for loans to be drawn from the store based on capacity to repay. This earned Bligh the gratitude of the farmers, but the enmity of traders in the Corps who had been profiting greatly from the situation.

Under instructions from the Colonial Office, Bligh attempted to normalise trading conditions in the colony by prohibiting the use of spirits as payment for commodities. He communicated his policy to the Colonial Office in 1807, with the advice that his policy would be met with resistance. On 31 December 1807 Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh, Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, wrote back to Bligh with instructions to stop the barter of spirits.
H. V. Evatt concludes in his history of the Rebellion that Bligh &quot;was authorised to prevent free importation, to preserve the trade under his entire control, to enforce all penalties against illegal import, and to establish regulations at his discretion for the sale of spirits&quot;. He argues that the enmity of the monopolists within the colony stemmed from this prohibition and other policies which counteracted the power of the rich and promoted the welfare of the poor settlers. Bligh ceased the practice of handing out large land grants to the powerful in the colony; during his term, he granted just over 1,600 hectares of land, half of it to his daughter and himself.

Bligh also caused controversy by allowing a group of Irish convicts to be tried for revolt by a court that included their accusers. But when six of the eight were acquitted, he ordered them kept under arrest anyway. He dismissed D&#x27;Arcy Wentworth from his position of Assistant Surgeon to the Colony without explanation, and sentenced three merchants to a month&#x27;s imprisonment and a fine for writing a letter that he considered offensive. Bligh also dismissed Thomas Jamison from the magistracy, describing him in 1807 as being &quot;inimical&quot; to good government. Jamison was the highly capable (if crafty) Surgeon-General of New South Wales, and had accumulated significant personal wealth as a maritime trader; he was also a friend and business partner of the powerful Macarthur.

In October 1807 Major Johnston wrote a formal letter of complaint to the Commander-in-Chief of the British Army, stating that Bligh was abusive and interfering with the troops of the New South Wales Corps. Bligh had clearly made enemies of some of the most influential people in the colony. He also antagonised some of the less wealthy when he ordered those who had leases on government land within Sydney to remove their houses.

===Enmity between Bligh and Macarthur===

Macarthur had arrived with the New South Wales Corps in 1790 as a lieutenant, and by 1805 he had substantial farming and commercial interests in the colony. He had quarrelled with the governors preceding Bligh and had fought three duels.

Bligh and Macarthur&#x27;s interests clashed in a number of ways. Bligh stopped Macarthur from cheaply distributing large quantities of rum into the Corps and halted his allegedly illegal importation of stills. Macarthur&#x27;s interest in an area of land granted to him by King conflicted with Bligh&#x27;s town-planning interests. The two men were also engaged in other disagreements, including a conflict over landing regulations. In June 1807, a convict had stowed away and escaped Sydney on Macarthur&#x27;s schooner . When &quot;Parramatta&quot; returned to Sydney in December 1807, the bond held to ensure that masters and owners of vessels did not help prisoners escape the colony was deemed to be forfeited.

Bligh had the Judge Advocate, Richard Atkins, issue an order for Macarthur to appear on the matter of the bond on 15 December 1807. Macarthur disobeyed the order, was arrested and bailed, and failed to appear for trial at the next sitting of the Sydney Criminal Court on 25 January 1808. Atkins rejected this, but Macarthur&#x27;s protest had the support of the other six members of the court, all officers of the New South Wales Corps. Macarthur objected to Atkins being fit to sit in judgement of him because he was his debtor and inveterate enemy. Without the Judge Advocate, the trial could not take place and the court dissolved.

Bligh accused the six officers of what amounted to mutiny and summoned Johnston to come and deal with the matter. Johnston replied that he was ill, as he had wrecked his gig on the evening of 24 January on his way home to his farm after dining with officers of the Corps.

==Overthrow of Governor Bligh==

On the morning of 26 January 1808, Bligh again ordered that Macarthur be arrested and also ordered the return of court papers, which were held by officers of the New South Wales Corps. The Corps responded with a request for a new Judge Advocate and the release of Macarthur on bail. Bligh summoned the officers to Government House to answer charges made by Atkins, and he informed Johnston that he considered the action of the officers of the Corps to be treasonable.

Johnston, instead, visited the jail and issued an order releasing Macarthur, who drafted a petition calling for Johnston to arrest Bligh and take charge of the colony. This petition was signed by the officers of the Corps and other prominent citizens but, according to Evatt, most signatures had probably been added only after Bligh was safely under house arrest. Johnston consulted with the officers and issued an order stating that Bligh was &quot;charged by the respectable inhabitants of crimes that render you unfit to exercise the supreme authority another moment in this colony; and in that charge all officers under my command have joined.&quot; Johnston went on to call for Bligh to resign and submit to arrest.

At 6:00 pm, the Corps, with full band and colours, marched to Government House to arrest Bligh. They were hindered by his daughter and her parasol, but Captain Thomas Laycock finally found Bligh, in full dress uniform, behind his bed where he claimed he was hiding papers. Bligh was painted as a coward for this action, but Duffy argues that if Bligh was hiding, it would have been to escape and thwart the coup. In his book &quot;Captain Bligh&#x27;s Other Mutiny&quot;, Stephen Dando-Collins agrees and suggests that Bligh was planning to escape to the Hawkesbury River and to lead settlers there who were strongly supportive of him. During 1808 Bligh and his daughter were confined to Government House under house arrest. Bligh refused to leave for England until lawfully relieved of his duty.

Johnston took control with the rank of lieutenant-colonel on 25 April 1808 and appointed Charles Grimes, the Surveyor-General, as Judge Advocate. He ordered Macarthur and the six officers be tried; they were found not guilty. Macarthur was appointed as Colonial Secretary and effectively ran the business affairs of the colony.

Another prominent opponent of Bligh, Macarthur&#x27;s ally Thomas Jamison, was appointed as the colony&#x27;s Naval Officer (the equivalent of Collector of Customs and Excise) and also reinstated as a magistrate. This enabled him and his fellow legal officers to scrutinise Bligh&#x27;s personal papers for evidence of wrongdoing. In June 1809 Jamison sailed to London to bolster his business interests and give evidence against Bligh in any legal prosecutions that might be brought against the mutineers. He died in London at the beginning of 1811, however, so could not testify at Johnston&#x27;s court martial in June of that year.

Shortly after the coup, a watercolour by an unknown artist, illustrating Bligh&#x27;s arrest, was exhibited in Sydney at perhaps Australia&#x27;s first public art exhibition. The watercolour depicts a Corps soldier dragging Bligh from underneath one of the servants&#x27; beds in Government House, with two other soldiers standing by. The two soldiers in the watercolour are most likely John Sutherland and Michael Marlborough, and the other figure on the far right is believed to represent Lieutenant William Minchin. This watercolour is Australia&#x27;s earliest surviving political cartoon. The Corps regarded themselves as gentlemen and in depicting Bligh as a coward, the cartoon declares that Bligh was not a gentleman and therefore not fit to govern.

The origins of the watercolour derive from a dispute between Bligh and Sergeant Major Whittle about Bligh demanding Whittle to pull down his house as it was halting improvements to the town. It has been suggested Whittle either commissioned the painting or had painted the watercolour himself, but some think neither is likely as Whittle was illiterate. But it is hard to fathom what bearing his ability to read and write had on his ability to paint or commission a painting.

===A new governor is appointed===

Following Bligh&#x27;s overthrow, Johnston had notified his superior officer, Colonel William Paterson, who was in Van Diemen&#x27;s Land (now called Tasmania) establishing a settlement at Port Dalrymple (now Launceston), of events. Paterson was reluctant to get involved until clear orders arrived from England. When he learned in March that Lieutenant-Colonel Joseph Foveaux was returning to Sydney with orders to become acting Lieutenant-Governor of New South Wales, Paterson left Foveaux to deal with the prevailing situation.

Foveaux arrived in July and took over the colony as lieutenant-colonel on 28 July 1808, which annoyed Macarthur. Since a decision was expected from England, and feeling that Bligh&#x27;s behaviour had been insufferable, Foveaux left Bligh under house arrest. He turned his attention to improving the colony&#x27;s roads, bridges and public buildings, which he felt had been badly neglected. When there was still no word from England, he summoned Paterson to Sydney in January 1809 to sort out matters. Paterson sent Johnston and Macarthur to England for trial, and confined Bligh to the barracks until he signed a contract agreeing to return to England. Paterson, whose health was failing, retired to Government House and left Foveaux to run the colony.

In January 1809 Bligh was given the control of HMS &quot;Porpoise&quot; on condition that he return to England. However, Bligh sailed to Hobart in Van Diemen&#x27;s Land, seeking the support of Lieutenant-Governor David Collins to retake control of the New South Wales Colony. Collins refused to support him and on Paterson&#x27;s orders, Bligh remained cut off on board &quot;Porpoise&quot;, moored at the mouth of the River Derwent south of Hobart, until January 1810.

The Colonial Office finally decided that sending naval governors to rule the New South Wales Colony was untenable. Instead the New South Wales Corps, now known as the 102nd Regiment of Foot, was to be recalled to England and replaced with the 73rd Regiment of Foot, whose commanding officer would take over as governor. Bligh was to be reinstated for twenty-four hours, then recalled to England; Johnston sent to England for court martial; and Macarthur tried in Sydney. Major-General Lachlan Macquarie was put in charge of the mission after Major-General Miles Nightingall fell ill before departure. Macquarie took over as governor with an elaborate ceremony on 1 January 1810.

==Aftermath==
Macquarie reinstated all the officials who had been sacked by Johnston and Macarthur, replaced the alcoholic Atkins with Ellis Bent (the first professional lawyer to occupy a public post in Australia) as Judge Advocate, and cancelled all land and stock grants that had been made since Bligh&#x27;s deposition. To calm things down, he made grants that he thought appropriate and prevented any reprisals. When Bligh received the news of Macquarie&#x27;s arrival, he sailed to Sydney, arriving on 17 January 1810 to collect evidence for the forthcoming court martial of Johnston. He departed for the trial in England on 12 May, arriving on 25 October 1810 aboard .

Having informally heard arguments from both sides, the government authorities in England were not impressed by either Macarthur and Johnston&#x27;s accusations against Bligh, nor by Bligh&#x27;s ill-tempered letters accusing key figures in the colony of unacceptable conduct. Johnston was court-martialled, found guilty and cashiered, the lowest penalty possible. He was able to return as a free citizen to his estate, Annandale, in Sydney. Macarthur was not tried but was refused permission to return to New South Wales until 1817, since he would not admit his wrongdoing. Bligh&#x27;s promotion to rear admiral was held up until the end of Johnston&#x27;s trial. Afterward it was backdated to 31 July 1810, and Bligh took up a position that had been kept for him. He continued his naval career in the Admiralty, without command, and died of cancer in 1817.

Macquarie had been impressed with Foveaux&#x27;s administration, putting his name forward to succeed Collins as Lieutenant-Governor of Tasmania because he could think of no one more fitting; and considered that he could not have acted otherwise with regard to Bligh. However, when Foveaux returned to England in 1810 he was court-martialled for assenting to Bligh being deposed and imprisoned; Macquarie&#x27;s recommendation was ignored. Foveaux was taken back into active service in 1811 and promoted to lieutenant-colonel of the 1st Regiment Greek Light Infantry. He pursued an uneventful military career after that, rising to the rank of lieutenant-general.

==Causes==
Michael Duffy, an author writing in 2006, says

::Essentially it was the culmination of a long-running tussle for power between the government and private entrepreneurs, a fight over the future and the nature of the colony. The early governors wanted to keep NSW as a large-scale open prison, with a primitive economy based on yeomen ex-convicts and run by government fiat.

Duffy goes on to say that the Rebellion was not thought of at the time as being about rum:

::... almost no one at the time of the rebellion thought it was about rum. Bligh tried briefly to give it that spin, to smear his opponents, but there was no evidence for it and he moved on.

::Many years later, in 1855, an English Quaker named William Howitt published a popular history of Australia. Like many teetotallers, he was keen to blame alcohol for all the problems in the world. Howitt took Bligh&#x27;s side and invented the phrase Rum Rebellion, and it has stuck ever since.

&quot;The Biography of Early Australia&quot; dismisses Macarthur&#x27;s complaints as ridiculous and quotes Evatt as saying that legally Macarthur was guilty of two out of the three charges brought against him, including sedition. Both consider that Bligh was wholly justified in his actions because he was the legitimate authority. Duffy asserts that had Johnston arrived when summoned on 25 January, the Rum Rebellion probably would never have happened.

<text>A desktop computer, often abbreviated as desktop, is a personal computer designed for regular use at a stationary location on or near a desk (as opposed to a portable computer) due to its size and power requirements. The most common configuration has a case that houses the power supply, motherboard (a printed circuit board with a microprocessor as the central processing unit, memory, bus, certain peripherals and other electronic components), disk storage (usually one or more hard disk drives, solid-state drives, optical disc drives, and in early models floppy disk drives); a keyboard and mouse for input; and a monitor, speakers, and, often, a printer for output. The case may be oriented horizontally or vertically and placed either underneath, beside, or on top of a desk.

Desktop computers with their cases oriented vertically are referred to as towers. As the majority of cases offered since the mid 1990s are in this form factor, the term &quot;desktop&quot; has been retronymically used to refer to modern cases offered in the traditional horizontal orientation.

==History==
===Origins===

Prior to the widespread use of microprocessors, a computer that could fit on a desk was considered remarkably small; the type of computers most commonly used were minicomputers, which, despite the name, were rather large and were &quot;mini&quot; only compared to the so-called &quot;big iron&quot;. Early computers, and later the general purpose high throughput &quot;mainframes&quot;, took up the space of a whole room. Minicomputers, on the contrary, generally fit into one or a few refrigerator-sized racks, or, for the few smaller ones, &quot;built into&quot; a fairly large desk, not put &quot;on top&quot; of it.

It was not until the 1970s when fully programmable computers appeared that could fit entirely on top of a desk. 1970 saw the introduction of the Datapoint 2200, a &quot;smart&quot; computer terminal complete with keyboard and monitor, was designed to connect with a mainframe computer but that did not stop owners from using its built-in computational abilities as a stand-alone desktop computer. The HP 9800 series, which started out as programmable calculators in 1971 but was programmable in BASIC by 1972, used a smaller version of a minicomputer design based on ROM memory and had small one-line LED alphanumeric displays and displayed graphics with a plotter. The Wang 2200 of 1973 had a full-size cathode-ray tube (CRT) and cassette tape storage. The IBM 5100 in 1975 had a small CRT display and could be programmed in BASIC and APL. These were generally expensive specialized computers sold for business or scientific uses.

===Growth and development===

Apple II, TRS-80 and Commodore PET were first generation personal home computers launched in 1977, which were aimed at the consumer market – rather than businessmen or computer hobbyists. &quot;Byte&quot; magazine referred to these three as the &quot;1977 Trinity&quot; of personal computing. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, desktop computers became the predominant type, the most popular being the IBM PC and its clones, followed by the Apple Macintosh, with the third-placed Commodore Amiga having some success in the mid-1980s but declining by the early 1990s.

Early personal computers, like the original IBM Personal Computer, were enclosed in a &quot;desktop case&quot;, horizontally oriented to have the display screen placed on top, thus saving space on the user&#x27;s actual desk, although these cases had to be sturdy enough to support the weight of CRT displays that were widespread at the time. Over the course of the 1990s, desktop cases gradually became less common than the more-accessible tower cases that may be located on the floor under or beside a desk rather than on a desk. Not only do these tower cases have more room for expansion, they have also freed up desk space for monitors which were becoming larger every year. Desktop cases, particularly the compact form factors, remain popular for corporate computing environments and kiosks. Some computer cases can be interchangeably positioned either horizontally (desktop) or upright (mini-tower).

Influential games such as &quot;Doom&quot; and &quot;Quake&quot; during the 1990s had pushed gamers and enthusiasts to frequently upgrade to the latest CPUs and graphics cards (3dfx, ATI, and Nvidia) for their desktops (usually a tower case) in order to run these applications, though this has slowed since the late 2000s as the growing popularity of Intel integrated graphics forced game developers to scale back. Creative Technology&#x27;s Sound Blaster series were a &quot;de facto&quot; standard for sound cards in desktop PCs during the 1990s until the early 2000s, when they were reduced to a niche product, as OEM desktop PCs came with sound boards integrated directly onto the motherboard.

===Decline===

While desktops have long been the most common configuration for PCs, by the mid-2000s the growth shifted from desktops to laptops. Notably, while desktops were mainly produced in the United States, laptops had long been produced by contract manufacturers based in Asia, such as Foxconn. This shift led to the closure of the many desktop assembly plants in the United States by 2010. Another trend around this time was the increasing proportion of inexpensive base-configuration desktops being sold, hurting PC manufacturers such as Dell whose build-to-order customization of desktops relied on upselling added features to buyers.

Battery-powered portable computers had just a 2% worldwide market share in 1986. However, laptops have become increasingly popular, both for business and personal use.
Around 109 million notebook PCs shipped worldwide in 2007, a growth of 33% compared to 2006.
In 2008, it was estimated that 145.9 million notebooks were sold and that the number would grow in 2009 to 177.7 million. The third quarter of 2008 was the first time when worldwide notebook PC shipments exceeded desktops, with 38.6 million units versus 38.5 million units.

The sales breakdown of the Apple Macintosh has seen sales of desktop Macs staying mostly constant while being surpassed by that of Mac notebooks whose sales rate has grown considerably; seven out of ten Macs sold were laptops in 2009, a ratio projected to rise to three out of four by 2010. The change in sales of form factors is due to the desktop iMac moving from affordable G3 to upscale G4 model and subsequent releases are considered premium all-in-ones. By contrast, the MSRP of the MacBook laptop lines have dropped through successive generations such that the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro constitute the lowest price of entry to a Mac, with the exception of the even more inexpensive Mac Mini (albeit without a monitor and keyboard), and the MacBooks are the top-selling form factors of the Macintosh platform today.

The decades of development mean that most people already own desktop computers that meet their needs and have no need of buying a new one merely to keep pace with advancing technology. Notably, the successive release of new versions of Windows (Windows 95, 98, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10 and so on) had been drivers for the replacement of PCs in the 1990s, but this slowed in the 2000s due to the poor reception of Windows Vista over Windows XP. IDC analyst Jay Chou suggested that Windows 8 actually hurt sales of PCs in 2012, as businesses decided to stick with Windows 7 rather than upgrade. Some suggested that Microsoft had acknowledged &quot;implicitly ringing the desktop PC death knell&quot; as Windows 8 offered little upgrade in desktop PC functionality over Windows 7; instead, Windows 8&#x27;s innovations were mostly on the mobile side.

The post-PC trend saw a decline in the sales of desktop and laptop PCs. The decline was attributed to increased power and applications of alternative computing devices, namely smartphones and tablet computers. Although most people exclusively use their smartphones and tablets for more basic tasks such as social media and casual gaming, these devices have in many instances replaced a second or third PC in the household that would have performed these tasks, though most families still retain a powerful PC for serious work.

Among PC form factors, desktops remain a staple in the enterprise market but lost popularity among home buyers. PC makers and electronics retailers responded by investing their engineering and marketing resources towards laptops (initially netbooks in the late 2000s, and then the higher-performance Ultrabooks from 2011 onwards), which manufacturers believed had more potential to revive the PC market than desktops.

In April 2017, StatCounter declared a &quot;Milestone in technology history and end of an era&quot; with the mobile Android operating system becoming more popular than Windows (the operating system that made desktops dominant over mainframe computers). Windows is still most popular on desktops (and laptops), while smartphones (and tablets) use Android or iOS.

===Resurgence===

Towards the middle of the 2010s, media sources began to question the existence of the post-PC trend, at least as conventionally defined, stating that the so-called post-PC devices are just other portable forms of PCs joining traditional desktop PCs which still have their own operation areas and evolve.

Although for casual use traditional desktops and laptops have seen a decline in sales, in 2018, global PC sales experienced a resurgence, driven by the business market. Desktops remain a solid fixture in the commercial and educational sectors. According to the International Data Corporation (IDC), PC sales shot up 14.8% between 2020 and 2021 and desktop market grew faster than the laptop market in the second quarter of 2021. Total PC shipments during 2021 reached 348.8 million units, up 14.8% from 2020. This represents the highest level of shipments the PC market has seen since 2012. In addition, gaming desktops have seen a global revenue increase of 54% annually. For gaming the global market of gaming desktops, laptops, and monitors is expected to grow to 61.1 million shipments by the end of 2023, up from 42.1 million, with desktops growing from 15.1 million shipments to 19 million. PC gaming as a whole accounts for 28% of the total gaming market as of 2017. This is partially due to the increasing affordability of desktop PCs.

==Types==
===By size===
====Full-size====
Full-sized desktops are characterized by separate display and processing components. These components are connected to each other by cables or wireless connections. They often come in a tower form factor. These computers are easy to customize and upgrade per user requirements, e.g. by expansion card.

Early extended-size (significantly larger than mainstream ATX case) tower computers sometimes were labeled as &quot;deskside computers&quot;, but currently this naming is quite rare.

====Compact====
Compact desktops are reduced in physical proportions compared to full-sized desktops. They are typically small-sized, inexpensive, low-power computers designed for basic tasks such as web browsing, accessing web-based applications, document processing, and audio/video playback. Hardware specifications and processing power are usually reduced and hence make them less appropriate for running complex or resource-intensive applications. A nettop is a notable example of a compact desktop. A laptop without a screen can functionally be used as a compact desktop, sometimes called a &quot;slabtop&quot;.

===Form factor===
====All-in-one====
An &quot;all-in-one&quot; (AIO) desktop computer integrates the system&#x27;s internal components into the same case as the display, thus occupying a smaller footprint (with fewer cables) than desktops that incorporate a tower. The All-in-one systems are rarely labeled as desktop computers.

====Tower====
In personal computing, a tower is a form factor of desktop computer case whose height is much greater than its width, thus having the appearance of an upstanding tower block.

====Pizza box form factor====
In computing, a pizza box enclosure is a design for desktop computers. Pizza box cases tend to be wide and flat, resembling pizza delivery boxes and thus the name.
====Cube====

Cube Workstations have a cube case enclosure to house the motherboard, PCI-E expansion cards, GPU, CPU, DRAM DIMM slots, computer cooling equipment, chipsets, I/O ports, hard disk drives, and solid-state drives.
=== By usage ===
==== Gaming computer ====

Gaming computers are desktop computers with high performance CPU, GPU, and RAM optimized for playing video games at high resolution and frame rates. Gaming computer peripheries usually include mechanical keyboards for faster response time, and a gaming computer mouse which can track higher dots per inch movement.

==== Home theater ====

These desktops are connected to home entertainment systems and typically used for amusement purpose. They come with high definition display, video graphics, surround sound and TV tuner systems to complement typical PC features.

==== Thin client / Internet appliance ====

Over time some traditional desktop computers have been replaced with thin clients utilizing off-site computing solutions like the cloud. As more services and applications are served over the internet from off-site servers, local computing needs decrease, this drives desktop computers to be smaller, cheaper, and need less powerful hardware. More applications and in some cases entire virtual desktops are moved off-site and the desktop computer runs only an operating system or a shell application while the actual content is served from a server. Thin client computers may do almost all of their computing on a virtual machine in another site. Internal, hosted virtual desktops can offer users a completely consistent experience from anywhere.

==== Workstation ====

Workstations are advanced class of personal computers designed for a user and more powerful than a regular PC but less powerful than a server in regular computing. They are capable of high-resolution and three-dimensional interfaces, and typically used to perform scientific and engineering work. Like server computers, they are often connected with other workstations. The main form-factor for this class is a Tower case, but most vendors produce compact or all-in-one low-end workstations. Most tower workstations can be converted to a rack-mount version.

==== Desktop server ====
Oriented for small business class of servers; typically entry-level server machines, with similar to workstation/gaming PC computing powers and with some mainstream servers features, but with only basic graphic abilities; and some desktop servers can be converted to workstations.

== Comparison with laptops ==

Desktops have an advantage over laptops in that the spare parts and extensions tend to be standardized, resulting in lower prices and greater availability. For example, the size and mounting of the motherboard are standardized into ATX, microATX, BTX or other form factors. Desktops have several standardized expansion slots, like conventional PCI or PCI Express, while laptops tend to have only one mini-PCI slot and one PC Card slot (or ExpressCard slot). Procedures for assembly and disassembly of desktops tend to be simple and standardized as well. This tends not to be the case for laptops, though adding or replacing some parts, like the optical drive, hard disk, or adding an extra memory module is often quite simple. This means that a desktop computer configuration, usually a tower case, can be customized and upgraded to a greater extent than laptops. This customization has kept tower cases popular among gamers and enthusiasts.

Another advantage of the desktop is that (apart from environmental concerns) power consumption is not as critical as in laptop computers because the desktop is exclusively powered from the wall socket. Desktop computers also provide more space for cooling fans and vents to dissipate heat, allowing enthusiasts to overclock with less risk. The two large microprocessor manufacturers, Intel and AMD, have developed special CPUs for mobile computers (i.e. laptops) that consume less power and lower heat, but with lower performance levels.

Laptop computers, conversely, offer portability that desktop systems (including small form factor and all-in-one desktops) cannot due to their compact size and clamshell design. The laptop&#x27;s all-in-one design provides a built-in keyboard and a pointing device (such as a touchpad) for its user and can draw on power supplied by a rechargeable battery. Laptops also commonly integrate wireless technologies like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and 3G, giving them a broader range of options for connecting to the internet, though this trend is changing as newer desktop computers come integrated with one or more of these technologies.

A desktop computer needs a UPS to handle electrical disturbances like short interruptions, blackouts, and spikes; achieving an on-battery time of more than 20–30 minutes for a desktop PC requires a large and expensive UPS. A laptop with a sufficiently charged battery can continue to be used for hours in case of a power outage and is not affected by short power interruptions and blackouts.

A desktop computer often has the advantage over a comparable laptop in computational capacity. Overclocking is often more feasible on a desktop than on a laptop; similarly, hardware add-ons such as discrete graphics co-processors may be possible to install only in a desktop.

<doc id="52743" wikidata="Q536313" url="?curid=52743" title="Ashikaga Yoshiharu">
<text>was the twelfth &quot;shōgun&quot; of the Ashikaga shogunate from 1521 through 1546 during the late Muromachi period of Japan. He was the son of the eleventh &quot;shōgun&quot; Ashikaga Yoshizumi.

From a western perspective, Yoshiharu is significant, as he was shogun when the first contact of Japan with the European West took place in 1543. A Portuguese ship, blown off its course to China, landed in Japan. In 1526, Yoshiharu invited archers from neighboring provinces to come to the capital for an archery contest.

== Biography ==
His childhood name was Kameomaru (亀王丸). On 1 May 1521, after Shogun Ashikaga Yoshitane and Hosokawa Takakuni struggled for power over the shogunate and Yoshitane withdrew to Awaji Island, the way was clear for Minamoto-no Yoshiharu to be installed as shogun as he enters Kyoto.

In 1521, the Hosokawa Takakuni orchestrates the appointment of Yoshiharu as shōgun. By 1526, tumultuous events unfold, marked by the Kasai and Miyoshi rebellions. In 1528, the political landscape shifts dramatically as Yoshiharu is ousted by Miyoshi Nagamoto, setting the stage for a period of significant change.

The 1530s adds some complexities of the era, 1533 witnesses the eruption of the Ikkō rebellion. The pivotal year 1536 sees Emperor Go-Nara takes the throne, and by 1538, internal strife plagues the Koga Kubō&#x27;s family, introducing new layers of discord. Later in 1546 sees Yoshiharu seeking refuge in Ōmi, while his son, Yoshiteru, assumes the role of shōgun in exile.

Not having any political power and repeatedly being forced out of the capital of Kyoto, Yoshiharu retired in 1546 over a political struggle between Miyoshi Nagayoshi and Hosokawa Harumoto making his son Ashikaga Yoshiteru the thirteenth shogun. He dies on 20 May 1550. Later in 1568, supported by Oda Nobunaga, his son Ashikaga Yoshiaki became the fifteenth shogun.

<text>Jean-Charles, chevalier de Borda (4 May 1733 – 19 February 1799) was a French mathematician, physicist, and Navy officer.

==Biography==

Borda was born in the city of Dax to Jean‐Antoine de Borda and Jeanne‐Marie Thérèse de Lacroix.
In 1756, Borda wrote &quot;Mémoire sur le mouvement des projectiles&quot;, a product of his work as a military engineer. For that, he was elected to the French Academy of Sciences in 1764.

Borda was a mariner and a scientist, spending time in the Caribbean testing out advances in chronometers. Between 1777 and 1778, he participated in the American Revolutionary War. In 1781, he was put in charge of several vessels in the French Navy. In 1782, he was captured by the English, and was returned to France shortly after. He returned as an engineer in the French Navy, making improvements to waterwheels and pumps. He was appointed as France&#x27;s Inspector of Naval Shipbuilding in 1784, and with the assistance of the naval architect Jacques-Noël Sané in 1786 introduced a massive construction programme to revitalise the French navy based on the standard designs of Sané.

In 1770, Borda formulated a ranked preferential voting system that is referred to as the Borda count. The French Academy of Sciences used Borda&#x27;s method to elect its members for about two decades until it was quashed by Napoleon Bonaparte who insisted that his own method be used after he became president of the Académie in 1801. The Borda count is in use today in some academic institutions, competitions and several political jurisdictions. The Borda count has also served as a basis for other methods such as the Quota Borda system, Black&#x27;s method and Nanson&#x27;s method.

In 1778, he published his method of reducing lunar distance for computing the longitude, still regarded as the best of several similar mathematical procedures for navigation and position fixing in pre-chronometer days. They were used, for example, by Lewis and Clark to measure their latitude and longitude during their exploration of the North-western United States.

Another of his contributions is his construction of the standard metre, basis of the metric system to correspond to the arc measurement of Delambre and Méchain.
As an instrument maker, he improved the reflecting circle (invented by Tobias Mayer) and the repeating circle (invented by his assistant, Etienne Lenoir), the latter used to measure the meridian arc from Dunkirk to Barcelona by Delambre and Méchain.
==Tables of logarithms==

With the advent of the metric system, after the French Revolution it was decided that the quarter circle should be divided into 100 angular units, currently known as the &quot;gradian&quot;, instead of 90 degrees, and the gradian into 100 centesimal minutes of arc (centigrades) instead of 60 arc-minutes. This required the calculation of trigonometric tables and logarithms corresponding to the new unit and instruments for measuring angles in the new system.

Borda constructed instruments for measuring angles in the new units (the instrument could no longer be called a &quot;sextant&quot;) which was later used in the arc measurement of the meridian between Dunkirk and Barcelona by Delambre to determine the radius of the Earth and thus define the length of the metre. The tables of logarithms of sines, secants, and tangents were also required for the purposes of navigation. Borda was an enthusiast for the metric system and constructed tables of these logarithms starting in 1792 but their publication was delayed until after his death and only published in the Year IX (1801) as &quot;Tables of Logarithms of sines, secants, and tangents, co-secants, co-sines, and co-tangents for the Quarter of the Circle divided into 100 degrees, the degree into 100 minutes, and the minute into 100 seconds&quot; to ten decimals, and including his tables of logarithms to 7 decimals from 10,000 to 100,000 with tables for obtaining results to 10 decimals.

The division of the degree into hundredths was accompanied by the division of the day into 10 hours of 100 minutes (decimal time) and maps were required to show the new degrees of latitude and longitude. The Republican Calendar was abolished by Napoleon in 1806, but the 400-unit circle lived on as the Gradian.

==Honours==

<text>Albireo is a binary star designated Beta Cygni (β Cygni, abbreviated Beta Cyg, β Cyg). The International Astronomical Union uses the name &quot;Albireo&quot; specifically for the brightest star in the system. Although designated &#x27;beta&#x27;, it is fainter than Gamma Cygni, Delta Cygni, and Epsilon Cygni and is the fifth-brightest point of light in the constellation of Cygnus. Appearing to the naked eye to be a single star of magnitude 3, viewing through even a low-magnification telescope resolves it into its two components. The brighter yellow star, itself a very close trinary system, makes a striking colour contrast with its fainter blue companion.

==Nomenclature==

&quot;β Cygni&quot; (Latinised to &quot;Beta Cygni&quot;) is the system&#x27;s Bayer designation. The brighter of the two components is designated &quot;β¹ Cygni&quot; or &quot;Beta Cygni A&quot; and the fainter &quot;β² Cygni&quot; or &quot;Beta Cygni B&quot;.

The origin of the star system&#x27;s traditional name &quot;Albireo&quot; is unclear. Christian Ludwig Ideler traced it to the heading for the constellation we call Cygnus in Ptolemy&#x27;s star catalog, in the translation of the Almagest by Gerard of Cremona: &quot;Stellatio Eurisim: et est volans; et jam vocatur gallina. et dicitur eurisim quasi redolens ut lilium ab ireo&quot; (&quot;Constellation Eurisim: and it is the Flyer, and it is also called the Hen, and it is called Eurisim as if redolent like the lily from the &#x27;ireo&#x27;&quot;). (The original Greek just calls the constellation &quot;Ορνιθος αστερισμος&quot;, &quot;the constellation of the Bird&quot;.) The word &quot;ireo&quot; is obscure as wellIdeler suggests that Gerard took &quot;Eurisim&quot; to mean the plant &quot;Erysimum&quot;, which is called &quot;&quot; in Latin, but the ablative case of that is not &quot;ireo&quot; but &quot;irione&quot;. In any case, Ideler proposed that (somehow) the phrase &quot;ab ireo&quot; was applied to the star at the head of the bird, and this became &quot;Albireo&quot; when an &quot;l&quot; was mistakenly inserted as though it was an Arabic name. Ideler also supposed that the name Eurisim was a mistaken transliteration of the Arabic name &quot;Urnis&quot; for Cygnus (from the Greek &quot;Ορνις&quot;).

In 2016, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN&#x27;s first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included &quot;Albireo &quot; for β¹ Cygni. It is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names.

Medieval Arabic-speaking astronomers called Beta Cygni &#x27; (English: &quot;the hen&#x27;s beak&quot;). The term &#x27; (منقار الدجاجة) or &quot;Menchir al Dedjadjet&quot; appeared in the catalogue of stars in the &quot;Calendarium of Al Achsasi Al Mouakket&quot;, which was translated into Latin as &quot;Rostrum Gallinae&quot;, meaning &quot;the hen&#x27;s beak&quot;.

Since Cygnus is the swan, and Beta Cygni is located at the head of the swan, it is sometimes called the &quot;beak star&quot;. With Deneb, Gamma Cygni (Sadr), Delta Cygni, and Epsilon Cygni (Gienah), it forms the asterism called the Northern Cross.

==Properties==

Beta Cygni is about away from the Sun. When viewed with the naked eye, Albireo appears to be a single star. However, in a telescope it resolves into a double star consisting of β Cygni A (amber, apparent magnitude 3.1), and β Cygni B (blue-green, apparent magnitude 5.1). Separated by 35 seconds of arc, the two components provide one of the best contrasting double stars in the sky due to their different colors.

It is not known whether the two components β Cygni A and B are orbiting around each other in a physical binary system, or if they are merely an optical double. If they are a physical binary, their orbital period is probably at least 100,000 years. Some experts, however, support the optical double argument, based on observations that suggest different proper motions for the components, which implies that they are unrelated. The primary and secondary also have different measured distances from the Hipparcos mission – for the primary and for the secondary. More recently the Gaia mission has measured distances of about 330–390 light years (100–120 parsecs) for both components, but noise in the astrometric measurements for the stars means that data from Gaia&#x27;s second data release is not yet sufficient to determine whether the stars are physically associated.

In around 3.87 million years, Albireo will become the brightest star in the night sky. It will peak in brightness with an apparent magnitude of –0.53 in 4.61 million years.

There are a further 10 faint companions listed in the Washington Double Star catalogue, all fainter than magnitude 10. Only one is closer to the primary than Albireo B, with the others up to 142&quot; away.

===Albireo A===
The spectrum of Beta Cygni A was found to be composite when it was observed as part of the Henry Draper Memorial project in the late 19th century, leading to the supposition that it was itself double. This was supported by observations from 1898 to 1918 which showed that it had a varying radial velocity. In 1923, the two components were identified in the Henry Draper Catalogue as HD 183912 and HD 183913.

In 1978, speckle interferometry observations using the 1.93m telescope at the Haute-Provence Observatory resolved a companion at 0.125&quot;. This observation was published in 1980, and the companion is referred to as component Ab in the Washington Double Star Catalog.

In 1976 speckle interferometry was used to resolve a companion using the 2.1-meter telescope at the Kitt Peak National Observatory. It was measured at a separation of 0.44&quot;, and it is noted that the observation was inconsistent with the Haute-Provence observations and hence not of the same star. Although these observations pre-dated those at Haute-Provence, they were not published until 1982 and this component is designated Ac in the Washington Double Star Catalog. It is designated as component C in the Catalog of Components of Double and Multiple Stars, not to be confused with component C in the Washington Double Star Catalog which is a faint optical companion. An orbit for the pair has since been computed using interferometric measurements, but as only approximately a quarter of the orbit has been observed, the orbital parameters must be regarded as preliminary. The period of this orbit is 214 years. The confirmed close pair are referred to as Aa and Ac in modern papers, with Ab being the unconfirmed third component. A 2022 study treats the existence of Albireo Ab as &quot;very unlikely&quot;.

In 2022, a third component was found to be orbiting Albireo Aa, named Albireo Ad. It is a very-low-mass star with around 8.5% the Sun&#x27;s mass and an orbital period of 371 days.

The diameter of the primary K-type giant star has been measured using interferometry from the Navy Precision Optical Interferometer. A limb-darkened angular diameter of was measured. At the parallax-derived distance of 111.4pc, a radius equivalent to is calculated.

===Albireo B===
β Cygni B is a fast-rotating Be star, with an equatorial rotational velocity of at least 250 kilometers per second. Its surface temperature has been spectroscopically estimated to be about 13,200 K.

β Cygni B has been reported to be a very close double, but the observations appear to have been incorrect.

==Moving group==
Analysis of Gaia Data Release 2 astrometry suggests that four fainter stars may form a moving group along with the brighter visible components.

==Namesakes==
&quot;Albireo&quot; (AK-90) was a United States Navy &quot;Crater&quot;-class cargo ship named after the star.

<doc id="52750" wikidata="Q324748" url="?curid=52750" title="Basarab I of Wallachia">
<text>Basarab I (), also known as Basarab the Founder (; – 1351/1352), was a &quot;voivode&quot; and later the first independent ruler of Wallachia who lived in the first half of the . Many details of his life are uncertain. According to two popular theories, Basarab either came into power between 1304 and 1324 by dethroning or peacefully succeeding the legendary founder of Wallachia, Radu Negru, or in 1310 by succeeding his father, Thocomerius.

A royal charter issued on 26 July 1324 is the first document to reference Basarab. According to the charter, he was subject to Charles I of Hungary as the &quot;voivode&quot; of Wallachia. Basarab became &quot;disloyal to the Holy Crown of Hungary&quot; in 1325. He seized the Banate of Severin and raided the southern regions of the Kingdom of Hungary. Basarab supported Michael Shishman of Bulgaria&#x27;s attack against the Kingdom of Serbia, but their united armies were defeated in the Battle of Velbazhd on the 28th of July 1330. Soon after, Charles I of Hungary invaded Wallachia, but the Wallachians ambushed the royal troops in the Battle of Posada, between the 9th and 12 November 1330, nearly annihilating the entire force, subsequently ending Hungarian suzerainty in Wallachia, allowing the foundation of the first independent Romanian principality. Basarab&#x27;s descendants ruled Wallachia for at least two centuries. The region of Bessarabia, situated between the rivers Dniester and Prut, was named for the Basarab dynasty.

==Origins==
Basarab was the son of Thocomerius, according to a charter written by Charles I of Hungary in 1332. Thocomerius&#x27; social position cannot be determined. A scholarly hypothesis states that he was descended from Seneslau, a mid-13th-century Vlach (Romanian) lord. Historian Vlad Georgescu writes that Thocomerius was the probable successor to Bărbat, the late 13th-century ruler of Oltenia. Historian Tudor Sălăgean says that Thocomerius was &quot;a local potentate.&quot;

Basarab&#x27;s name is of Turkic origin. Its first part is the present participle for the verb &quot;bas-&quot; (&quot;press, rule, govern&quot;); the second part matches the Turkic honorific title &quot;aba&quot; or &quot;oba&quot; (&quot;father, elder kinsman&quot;), which can be recognized in Cuman names, such as Terteroba, Arslanapa and Ursoba. Basarab&#x27;s name implies that he was of Cuman or Pecheneg ancestry, but this hypothesis has not been proven. At least four royal charters from the 14th century refer to Basarab as a Vlach. Charles I of Hungary referred to him as &quot;Basarab, our disloyal Vlach&quot; in 1332.

Pope John XXII addressed Basarab as a &quot;devout Catholic prince&quot; in a letter written on 1 February 1327. On the same day, the pope sent similar letters to Charles I of Hungary and his high officials, including Thomas Szécsényi, the voivode of Transylvania, and Mikcs Ákos, the ban of Slavonia, asking them to support the Dominicans&#x27; actions against the &quot;heretics&quot;. According to scholar Neagu Djuvara, this correspondence with the Holy See proves that Basarab was a Catholic, which also testifies to Basarab&#x27;s Cuman origin, because the Cumans had been baptized according to Catholic rite. Historians Matei Cazacu and Dan Mureșan reject Djuvara&#x27;s theory, saying that all other sources prove that Basarab was an Eastern Orthodox. For instance, the &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot;, completed in the late 1350s, referred to Basarab as a &quot;perfidious schismatic.&quot;

==Reign==
===Charles I&#x27;s &quot;voivode&quot;===

The details of Basarab&#x27;s accession are obscure. Early Romanian chronicles attribute the establishment of Wallachia to the legendary Radu Negru. According to 17th-century Wallachian chronicles, Radu Negru, after departing from Făgăraș, arrived in Wallachia in either 1290 or 1292, accompanied by &quot;many peoples&quot;. One of those chronicles, &quot;Istoria Țării Românești&quot;, states that &quot;Basarab&quot; was the surname of an Oltenian boyar family, who accepted Radu Negru&#x27;s suzerainty following his &quot;dismounting&quot;. Historian Neagu Djuvara tentatively associates Basarab (or, alternatively, Basarab&#x27;s father) with Radu Negru; Laurențiu Rădvan writes that Basarab either dethroned or peacefully succeeded Radu Negru between 1304 and 1324. Other historians, such as Vlad Georgescu, state that Basarab succeeded his father, Thocomerius, around 1310.

Basarab was first mentioned in a royal charter issued by Charles I of Hungary on 26 July 1324, in which he was described as &quot;our voivode of Wallachia&quot;. This shows that Charles I regarded Basarab as a loyal vassal at that time. Historian István Vásáry states that Basarab only accepted Charles&#x27; suzerainty after the king restored royal authority in the Banate of Severin, a Hungarian border province, in 1321. In exchange for his loyalty, Basarab&#x27;s possession of Severin Fort was confirmed, according to historians Tudor Sălăgean and Attila Bárány.

===Towards independence===


A royal charter dated 18 June 1325 records that a person named Stephen, who was the son of a Cuman &quot;ispán&quot; in Hungary, stated that the king was weaker than Basarab and &quot;did not even reach up to [his] ankle&quot;. The same charter describes Basarab as &quot;disloyal to the Holy Crown of Hungary&quot;, showing that Basarab had betrayed the crown. A royal charter from 1329 listed Basarab, along with the Bulgarians, Serbs and Tatars, as an enemy who &quot;[made] hostile inroads&quot; around Mehadia. Basarab seems to have entirely controlled the Banate of Severin between 1324 and 1330, since royal charters did not mention a Ban of Severin during this period. In a letter written in 1327, Pope John XXII alluded to &quot;territories of the Kingdom of Hungary which were subjected&quot; to Basarab.

Michael III Shishman, Tsar of Bulgaria, attacked Serbia in 1330. He was accompanied by &quot;the ruler of the Yas&quot;, along with Vlach and &quot;black Tatar&quot; auxiliary troops. According to Serbian sources and a letter written by Stephen Dušan, who became King of Serbia in 1331, Basarab personally led his army to Serbia to assist Shishman. The Serbs routed the united army of Michael Shishman and his allies at the Battle of Velbazhd on 28 July 1330. Shishman was killed while fleeing from the battlefield.

Taking advantage of the weakened state of Basarab&#x27;s allies, Charles I of Hungary decided to restore his suzerainty in Wallachia. According to a royal charter issued two years after the events, Charles wanted to recapture &quot;marginal lands&quot; that Basarab &quot;illegally&quot; held in Wallachia. He invaded Oltenia, captured Severin Fort and appointed Denis Szécsi Ban of Severin in September 1330. According to the &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot;, Basarab offered 7,000 &quot;marks of silver&quot; as compensation, along with a yearly tribute to the king. He also promised to send one of his sons to the royal court in Visegrád.

However, Charles I refused Basarab&#x27;s offer, saying that &quot;[h]e is the shepherd of my sheep, and I will drag him by his beard from his lair&quot;. Charles continued his campaign, but he and his soldiers suffered from hunger while marching to Curtea de Argeș through a sparsely populated region. Charles was compelled to sign an armistice with Basarab, and the royal army started retreating from Wallachia. On 9 November, however, the Wallachians ambushed the king and his soldiers at a narrow pass in the Southern Carpathians. Standing on the cliffs above the valley, the Wallachians shot arrows and threw rocks upon the army. The battle lasted until 12 November. The royal army was decimated, and King Charles narrowly escaped. Historian Sălăgean writes that Basarab repelled Charles&#x27; invasion without assistance from his allies. A charter written in 1351 by Louis I, Charles&#x27; son and successor, states that pagan &quot;neighbors and a troop formed of other subjects unfaithful&quot; to Charles supported Basarab during the war, suggesting that Tatar auxiliaries fought for Basarab. However, the credibility of the report, written decades after the events, is uncertain.

===Independent ruler===
Archaeological research shows that after his capital of Curtea de Argeș was destroyed during Charles I&#x27;s campaign, Basarab moved his seat to Câmpulung. Basarab&#x27;s victory in the Battle of Posada enabled the introduction of an active foreign policy. He supported the efforts of his son-in-law, Ivan Alexander, to seize the Bulgarian crown, which he did in February 1331. With Basarab&#x27;s support, Ivan Alexander successfully campaigned against the Byzantine Empire in 1331 and 1332. According to Sălăgean, Basarab allegedly took possession of Severin Fort in the early 1330s.

The reconstruction of Curtea de Argeș started after 1340, with the erection of new fortifications and a new palace. The construction of the Princely Church of Saint Nicholas in Curtea de Argeș also commenced during Basarab&#x27;s rule, but it was completed after his death. Basarab seems to have made his son, Nicholas Alexander, his co-ruler around 1344. Louis I of Hungary, who had succeeded Charles I in 1342, marched to southeastern Transylvania in the summer of 1344. To prevent a campaign against Wallachia, Nicholas Alexander visited Louis I and swore loyalty to him, according to the nearly contemporaneous John of Küküllő&#x27;s chronicle. Wallachian troops supported Andrew Lackfi&#x27;s attack against the Mongols in 1345, according to a Wallachian chronicle, but historian Victor Spinei rejects this report. According to a charter of his grandson, Vladislav I Vlaicu, Basarab died in the year 6860 of the Byzantine calendar, which is AD 1351 or 1352.

==Family==
A diptych from Câmpulung contains a reference to &quot;&quot;Io&quot; Basarab voivode and his wife, Marghita&quot;. Although the diptych (which was revised and renewed in 1710) may contain a scribal error, historians tend to accept that Basarab&#x27;s wife was named Marghita (from Margarete). According to Wallachian folklore, Marghita was the Catholic wife of the legendary founder of Wallachia, Radu Negru. She was told to have erected a Catholic church in Câmpulung, and committed suicide after the church was destroyed on her husband&#x27;s order.

In his letter concerning the Battle of Velbazhd, Stephen Dušan mentioned that Basarab was &quot;the father-in-law of Tsar Alexander of Bulgaria&quot;, showing that Basarab&#x27;s daughter, Theodora, was Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria&#x27;s wife. Historian Vásáry states that Basarab married her to Ivan Alexander around 1323 to strengthen his alliance with Bulgaria. She gave birth to children, but Ivan Alexander abandoned her and married a converted Jew, Sarah-Theodora, in the 1350s. Basarab&#x27;s son and successor, Nicholas Alexander, discontinued Basarab&#x27;s alliance with Bulgaria.

==Legacy==
Basarab&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Posada was a turning point in the history of Wallachia. Sălăgean writes that the victory &quot;sanctioned the independence of Wallachia from the Hungarian crown&quot; and altered its international status. Georgescu describes Wallachia as the &quot;first independent Romanian principality.&quot; Although the kings of Hungary continued to demand loyalty from the voivodes of Wallachia, Basarab and his successors yielded to them only temporarily in the .

The descendants of Basarab ruled Wallachia for at least two centuries. Examples of his descendants include Mircea the Old and Vlad Dracula. Neagoe Basarab, a member of the Craiovești boyar family, forged a genealogy to prove that he was a descendant of Basarab, and adopted &quot;Basarab&quot; as his family name after his accession in 1512.

From the middle of the , Bulgarian, Hungarian, Moldavian and Serbian chronicles used the name &quot;Basarab&quot; when referring to Wallachia. From the next century onward, the southern region of the land between the Dniester and Prut rivers was named &quot;Basarabia&quot;. After the Russian Empire annexed Basarabia in 1812, the region was renamed to Bessarabia. The region is now part of the Republic of Moldova.

<doc id="52751" wikidata="Q2603291" url="?curid=52751" title="Uriah Heep (David Copperfield)">
<text>Uriah Heep is a fictional character created by Charles Dickens in his 1850 novel &quot;David Copperfield&quot;. Heep is the primary antagonist during the second part of the novel. His character is notable for his sycophancy.

==In the novel==
David first meets the 15-year-old Heep when he comes to live with Mr. Wickfield and his daughter Agnes.

Uriah is a law clerk working for Mr. Wickfield. He realises that his widowed employer has developed a severe drinking problem and turns it to his advantage. Uriah encourages Wickfield&#x27;s drinking, tricks him into thinking he has committed financial wrongdoing while drunk, and blackmails him into making Uriah a partner in his law office. He admits to David (whom he hates) that he intends to manipulate Agnes into marrying him.

Uriah miscalculates when he hires Mr. Micawber as a clerk, assuming Micawber will never risk his own financial security by exposing Uriah&#x27;s transgressions. Yet Micawber is honest, and he, David, and Tommy Traddles confront Uriah with proof of his frauds. They let Uriah go free only after he has (reluctantly) agreed to resign his position and return the money that he has stolen.

Later in the novel, David encounters Uriah for the last time. In prison for bank fraud and awaiting transportation, Uriah acts like a repentant model prisoner. However, in conversation with David, he reveals himself to remain full of malice.

==Origins==

Much of &quot;David Copperfield&quot; is autobiographical, and some scholars believe Heep&#x27;s mannerisms and physical attributes to be based on Hans Christian Andersen, whom Dickens met shortly before writing the novel. Uriah Heep&#x27;s schemes and behaviour could also be based on Thomas Powell, an employee of Thomas Chapman, a friend of Dickens&#x27;. Powell &quot;ingratiated himself into the Dickens household&quot; and was discovered to be a forger and a thief, having embezzled £10,000 from his employer. He later attacked Dickens in pamphlets, calling particular attention to Dickens&#x27; social class and background.

==Film and television==
In film and television adaptations, the character has been played by Peter Paget (1934), Roland Young (1935), Maxwell Shaw (1956), Colin Jeavons (1966), Ron Moody (1969), Martin Jarvis (1974), Paul Brightwell (1986), Nicholas Lyndhurst (1999), Frank MacCusker (2000) and Ben Whishaw (2018).

==Rock band==
The British rock band Uriah Heep is named after the character.

<doc id="52753" wikidata="Q921957" url="?curid=52753" title="Final Fantasy II">
<text>is a 1988 role-playing video game developed and published by Square for the Family Computer as the second installment of the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series. The game has received numerous enhanced remakes for the WonderSwan Color, the PlayStation, the Game Boy Advance, the PlayStation Portable, iOS, Android and Windows. As neither this game nor &quot;Final Fantasy III&quot; were initially released outside Japan, &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot; was originally released in North America as &quot;Final Fantasy II&quot;, so as not to confuse players. Following enhanced versions for iOS and Android in 2010 and 2012 respectively, the game was re-released again as part of the 2021 &quot;Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster&quot; series.

The game&#x27;s story centers on four youths whose parents were killed during an army invasion by the empire of Palamecia, who are using hellspawn to conquer the world. Three of the four main characters join a rebellion against the empire, embarking on missions to gain new magic and weapons, destroy enemy superweapons, and rescue leading members of the resistance. The Game Boy Advance remake adds a bonus story after the game is completed.

&quot;Final Fantasy II&quot; introduced many elements that would later become staples of the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; franchise, including chocobos and the recurring character Cid. It also eliminated the traditional experience point leveling system of the previous and later games in the series, instead introducing an activity-based progression system where the characters&#x27; statistics increase according to how they are used or acquired. Despite being advertised as a sequel to &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;, the game includes no characters and locations from the first game. &quot;Final Fantasy II&quot; received little attention from non-Japanese reviewers at its initial release, though its remakes have garnered favorable reviews.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Final Fantasy II&quot; features gameplay similar to that of its predecessor, &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;. The player can freely roam an overworld containing several towns and dungeons. A menu-based system allows the player to outfit each character with equipment and up to two—often disposable—items for battle. Magic spells are assigned to the character from the item menu, and certain spells, such as &quot;Cure&quot;, spelled &quot;Kearu&quot; (IPA: [kéərɯ]) in the Japanese versions, can be used outside of battle. The player can also save their progress on the overworld. Weapons, armor, items, and magic spells can be purchased at shops, and townspeople provide useful information for the player&#x27;s progression through the game. One new feature is the &quot;Word Memory&quot; system: when in conversation with non-player characters (NPCs), the player can &quot;ask&quot; about and &quot;memorize&quot; special keywords or phrases, which can later be repeated to other NPCs to gain more information or unlock new actions. Similarly, there exist a handful of special items that can be shown to NPCs during conversation or used on certain objects, which have the same effect. Characters and monsters are no longer separated into separate windows in the battle screen as they were in the first &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;, and players can see their current and total hit points below the battle. Players can also fight with less than four characters in their party, which was not possible in the first game. &quot;Final Fantasy II&quot; introduced the chocobo, the signature &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; mascot, which lets characters ride to a location at great speed without being attacked by enemies. The recurring character Cid was also introduced, and a character of the same name has appeared in every main-series game since.

On the overworld and within dungeons, random encounters with enemies can be fought to improve each character&#x27;s attributes. Unlike the original &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;, players cannot upgrade their characters&#x27; classes. The game is also one of the few games in the series to not use experience-based levels. Instead, each character participating in battle develops depending on what actions they take. For instance, characters who frequently use a particular type of weapon will become more adept at wielding a weapon of that type, and will also increase in physical strength and accuracy. Attributes include hit points, magic points, magic power, stamina, strength, spirit, agility, intelligence, and evasion. Hit points (HP) and magic points (MP) increase with their use; a character who takes a heavy amount of damage in a battle might earn an increase in maximum HP, while a character who uses a lot of MP during battle might increase their maximum MP. This experience system had several unintended consequences that allowed characters to gain much more experience than intended, such as players having their characters attack each other and repeatedly cast spells, thus causing their HP and abilities to grow extensively. &quot;Final Fantasy II&quot; uses the same turn-based battle system seen in the original &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;, with battle parties consisting of up to four characters at a time. The game introduces a &quot;back row&quot; in battle, within which characters or enemies are immune to most physical attacks, but can be harmed with bows and magical attacks.

==Plot==
===Characters===
&quot;Final Fantasy II&quot; features four playable characters as well as several secondary characters who are only briefly controlled by the player. Primary characters include , a resident of the country of Fynn and the main protagonist; , a soft-spoken archer and dedicated enemy of the Empire; , a simple monk who communicates with animals; and , a conflicted dark knight who is missing for most of the game. Five playable characters temporarily join the party to assist Firion, Maria, and Guy in their missions for the rebellion. These are , the prince of Kashuan and a member of the rebellion; , a villager in the town of Salamand; , a pirate; , who is a White Mage with the rebellion, and , who is the first dragoon to appear in the series.

Firion and the (named in Kenji Terada&#x27;s novelization of the game) are the respective hero and villain representing &quot;Final Fantasy II&quot; in &quot;Dissidia Final Fantasy&quot;, &quot;Dissidia 012&quot; and &quot;Dissidia NT&quot;, fighting games featuring characters from across the series. Firion is voiced by Hikaru Midorikawa in the Japanese versions and by Johnny Yong Bosch in the English versions; Mateus is voiced by Kenyu Horiuchi in the Japanese versions and Christopher Corey Smith in the English versions. In the PlayStation&#x27;s opening FMV of &quot;Final Fantasy II&quot;, Firion is also voiced by Yukimasa Obi, while Maria is played by Noriko Shitaya, Guy by Kenta Miyake, and Leon by Takayuki Yamaguchi.

===Story===
Firion, Maria, Guy, and Leon are attacked by Palamecian Black Knight soldiers and left for dead. Firion, Maria, and Guy are rescued by Princess Hilda, who has established a rebel base in the town of Altair after her kingdom of Fynn was invaded by the Emperor. Hilda denies their request to join the rebel army because they are too young and inexperienced. The three set off for Fynn in search of Leon; there, they find a dying Prince Scott of Kashuan, Hilda&#x27;s fiancé, who informs them that a former nobleman of Kashuan, Borghen, betrayed the rebellion and became a general in the Imperial army. The party returns to Altair to notify Hilda. She allows the group to join the rebellion and asks them to journey north to find mythril, a metal that could be used to create powerful weapons. The party makes its way north to the occupied village of Salamand, where they save the villagers forced to work in the nearby mines, kill Borghen, and retrieve the Mythril.

For their next mission, the party is sent to the city of Bafsk to prevent the construction of a large airship known as the Dreadnought; however, it takes off just as they arrive. After retrieving the Sunfire, a weapon that can blow up the Dreadnought, they watch helplessly as an airship with Hilda on board is captured by the Dreadnought. When the Dreadnought lands to stock up on supplies, the party rescues Hilda and throws the Sunfire into the airship&#x27;s engine. Before escaping the explosion, the party encounters a dark knight Maria recognizes as Leon.

On his deathbed, the king of Fynn tasks the party to seek the help of the seemingly extinct dragoons of Deist. There, the party finds only a mother with her son, learning that all but one of the dragoons are dead, partly as a result of imperial poison. After placing an egg of the last wyvern in a cavern, the party returns to Altair and finds the Hilda they rescued is a lamia in disguise. The party slays the imposter and rescues the real Hilda before successfully reclaiming Fynn from the imperial forces. They then travel west, searching for a powerful magic item, joining forces with the last surviving dragoon. The party returns to Fynn and sees that many towns have been destroyed by a cyclone summoned by the Emperor. The party calls upon the newly born last wyvern to take them to a castle inside the cyclone, where they confront and kill the Emperor. Everyone celebrates the Empire&#x27;s defeat until a mortally wounded Fynn soldier arrives and reveals that Leon has taken the throne and plans to destroy the rebels with the Imperial army.

The party enters the castle of Palamecia and confronts Leon. Still, the Emperor reappears in the throne room in a new demonic form, revealing he has become the ruler of Hell and returned to destroy the entire world. The party and Leon escape Palamecia Castle with the wyvern as the castle is replaced with the palace of Hell, Pandaemonium. Leon agrees to help the group seal the Emperor away. The party travels to the Jade Passage, an underground passage to the underworld, and finds the portal to Pandaemonium, where they finally defeat the Emperor. Afterward, Leon chooses to leave in response to the trouble he caused, though Firion assures him that he will be welcomed back if and when he returns.

====&quot;Soul of Rebirth&quot;====
The &quot;Dawn of Souls&quot; remake of the game for the Game Boy Advance includes an additional storyline after the game, which follows the four party members who died during the game&#x27;s story.

Following his sacrifice to unseal the door guarding the Ultima Tome, Minwu awakens in a new area and sees someone resembling Gordon fight off Imperial soldiers. Minwu assists him, and the man soon explains he is Scott, Gordon&#x27;s brother. Minwu informs him of the events up to his demise, and the two surmise they are in the Jade Passage since they both died. They find Josef and, subsequently, Ricard, eventually emerging in Machanon, a village in the mirror image of Poft where the citizens are dead victims of the Emperor&#x27;s conquest, including Cid and Tobul, with the former asking the group to find out where they are and why they have been called here.

The four enter the teleporter at the north edge of town and enter what Minwu believes is Pandaemonium. Climbing to the highest floor, the party meets the Light Emperor, who explains that when Firion and his allies killed him, his soul was split, with the Emperor&#x27;s &quot;dark half&quot; falling to Hell and acquiring more power, while his light half—the Emperor they now see—ascended to Heaven. He then explains they are in Arubboth, the palace of Heaven, and the cave they traveled through was Raqia. In this place, fallen angels are cast down to become demons, and he called them here to ask for forgiveness on behalf of his dark half and offers them eternal life with him in Arubboth if they forgive his sins.

Though the offer tempts the four, apparitions of their loved ones show them a vision of Firion and his allies battling the Dark Emperor in Pandaemonium. Realizing this Emperor is just as evil as the original, the four reject his offer and defeat the Light Emperor just as Firion and his allies vanquish the Dark Emperor. As the rebels in the world of the living celebrate their victory, the four specters watch them and wish them well before fading away into peaceful rest.

During the development of the first installment in the series, Square&#x27;s management decided to manufacture 400,000 copies of the game to make a sequel possible, then the original Famicom (NES) version successfully shipped 520,000 copies in Japan. As there were no concrete ideas for &quot;Final Fantasy II&quot; from the start, it was eventually taken in a new direction and included none of the previous game&#x27;s characters or locations. Hironobu Sakaguchi, who had previously served as the main planner for &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;, assumed the role of director to accommodate for the larger development team. Using the experience gained from the first installment, which focused more on fitting story ideas into their new gameplay system and game world, the developers fully crafted the story of &quot;Final Fantasy II&quot; first. The gameplay was then built around the narrative. The experience system was designed to be a more realistic advancement system than that of the first game. Several members of the original staff from the first game reprised their jobs for &quot;Final Fantasy II&quot;. Sakaguchi again created the plot for the title, with the actual scenario written by Kenji Terada. Nobuo Uematsu composed the music, as he had for the first game, while Yoshitaka Amano was again the concept artist. As with the original, &quot;Final Fantasy II&quot; was programmed by Nasir Gebelli. Midway through the development of the game, Gebelli was forced to return to Sacramento, California from Japan due to an expired work visa. The rest of the development staff followed him to Sacramento with necessary materials and equipment and finished production of the game there. The game was released one day before the one-year anniversary of the first game&#x27;s release.

In April 1989, the game was novelized by its original scenario writer Kenji Terada under the title &quot;Final Fantasy II: Muma no Meikyū&quot; (lit. &quot;The Labyrinth of Nightmares&quot;). It was published in Japan exclusively by Kadokawa Shoten.

==Music==
The music for &quot;Final Fantasy II&quot; was later arranged by Tsuyoshi Sekito for the WonderSwan Color, PlayStation, and Game Boy Advance remakes. Although the two soundtracks were composed separately, the soundtrack to &quot;II&quot; has only been released as a combined album with the soundtrack to &quot;Final Fantasy I&quot;. They were first released as &quot;All Sounds of Final Fantasy I•II&quot; in 1989, which was then republished in 1994. An arranged album of music from the two soundtracks titled &quot;Symphonic Suite Final Fantasy&quot; was also released in 1989, while &quot;Final Fantasy &amp; Final Fantasy II Original Soundtrack&quot;, a combined soundtrack album for the PlayStation versions of the games, was released in 2002 and re-released in 2004. The music of &quot;Final Fantasy II&quot; has also appeared in various official concerts and live albums, such as &quot;20020220 music from Final Fantasy&quot;, a live recording of an orchestra performing music from the series including several pieces from the games. Additionally, several songs from the game were performed as part of a medley by the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra for the &quot;Distant Worlds – Music from Final Fantasy&quot; concert tour, while a different medley of songs from the game were performed by the New Japan Philharmonic Orchestra in the &quot;Tour de Japon: Music from Final Fantasy&quot; concert series.

==Versions and re-releases==
&quot;Final Fantasy II&quot; has been remade several times for different platforms, and has frequently been packaged with the first &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; in various collections. While all of these remakes retain the same basic story and battle mechanics, various tweaks have been made in different areas, including graphics, sound, and specific game elements.
===Unreleased English version===
Following the successful North American release of the original &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; by Nintendo in 1990, Square Soft, Square&#x27;s North American subsidiary, began work on an English language localization of &quot;Final Fantasy II&quot;, to be called &quot;Final Fantasy II: Dark Shadow Over Palakia&quot;. Assigned to the project was Kaoru Moriyama, whose later work included script translations for &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot; and &quot;Secret of Mana&quot; (known as &quot;Seiken Densetsu 2&quot; in Japan). Although a beta version was produced, and the game was advertised in several Square Soft trade publications, the long development time, the age of the original Japanese game and the arrival of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, the NES&#x27;s successor console, led Square Soft to cancel work on the &quot;Final Fantasy II&quot; localization in favor of the recently released &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot; (which, to avoid confusing North American players, was retitled &quot;Final Fantasy II&quot;).

Although a prototype cartridge of the English NES &quot;Final Fantasy II&quot; was produced, the project was, by Moriyama&#x27;s own admission, still far from complete: &quot;We had so very limited memory capacity we could use for each game, and it was never really &quot;translating&quot; but chopping up the information and cramming them back in... [Additionally] our boss had no understanding in putting in extra work for the English version at that time&quot;. In 2003, when the game was finally released to English-speaking audiences as part of &quot;Final Fantasy Origins&quot;, it was released with new graphics, music, and a brand new translation under the supervision of Akira Kashiwagi. A fan translation of the original game was also created prior to the release of &quot;Origins&quot;, and makes use of an original translation as the existence of the prototype cartridge was not common knowledge at the time.

===Re-releases===
In addition to its original Famicom release, &quot;Final Fantasy II&quot; was re-released on the WonderSwan Color in 2001, and both singularly and as part of a collection with &quot;Final Fantasy I&quot; for the PlayStation in 2002. It was released on the Game Boy Advance in 2004 as part of &quot;Final Fantasy I &amp; II: Dawn of Souls&quot;, on the PlayStation Portable in 2007, and for the Japanese Wii Virtual Console on June 16, 2009.

The &quot;Final Fantasy I•II&quot; collection included the original game with only minor changes. The WonderSwan Color remake of the game was first released on May 3, 2001, and later included as a bundle with a special &quot;Final Fantasy II&quot; edition of the console. It included completely redone graphics in the manner of the 16-bit generation &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games and includes larger character sprites, remixed music by Tsuyoshi Sekito, and full graphical backgrounds in battle mode. The PlayStation version featured even more graphical updates over the WonderSwan version, and the soundtrack was again remixed by Tsuyoshi Sekito to a higher quality so as to utilise the audio capabilities of the PlayStation. Sekito also composed a few new tracks to be used in the new cutscenes. It was published both individually (in Japan only) and alongside &quot;Final Fantasy I&quot; in a collection entitled &quot;Final Fantasy Origins&quot; (or &quot;Final Fantasy I+II Premium Collection&quot; in Japan); this was the first release of the game outside Japan. The port was re-released as part of the &quot;Final Fantasy 25th Anniversary Ultimate Box&quot; package in December 2012.

&quot;Final Fantasy II&quot; was again released in a new format in 2004 for the Game Boy Advance as part of &quot;Final Fantasy I &amp; II: Dawn of Souls&quot;. The primary change for this version was the addition of a bonus storyline entitled &quot;Soul of Rebirth&quot; accessible to the player after completing the game. In 2005 and 2006, Square Enix released a version of &quot;Final Fantasy II&quot; for three Japanese mobile phone networks. To celebrate the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series&#x27; 20th anniversary, the game was released in Japan for the PlayStation Portable in 2007. The remake features improved graphics, the cutscenes and soundtrack from &quot;Final Fantasy Origins&quot;, and the bonus quest and dungeons from &quot;Final Fantasy I &amp; II: Dawn of Souls&quot;. It additionally includes four new dungeons in which more character-specific equipment can be found, alongside powerful enemies and two new bosses. The release for the Japanese Virtual Console for the Wii on June 16, 2009, for the Wii U on December 11, 2013, and for the Nintendo 3DS on February 12, 2014, is identical to the original Famicom release, incorporating none of the updates of the later versions. On February 25, 2010, Square Enix released a port of the PSP version modified with touchscreen controls for the iOS platform. Following this, a touchscreen port was brought to Android in 2012 through the Google Play store.

==Reception==
According to Square&#x27;s publicity department, the original Famicom release sold 800,000 copies. As of March 2003, the game, including all re-releases at the time, had shipped 1.28 million copies worldwide, with 1.08 million of those copies being shipped in Japan and 200,000 abroad. Despite having only been released in June of that year, as of September 2007 the PlayStation Portable version had shipped 90,000 copies in Japan and 70,000 in North America. Despite these high sales, the game had sold the fewest copies of any of the first ten main games in the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series.

Upon release, &quot;Famicom Tsūshin&quot; (now &quot;Famitsu&quot;) gave the original Famicom version a score of 35 out of 40, based on a panel of four reviewers giving it ratings of 9, 9, 9 and 8 out of 10. This made it one of their three highest-rated games of 1988, along with &quot;Dragon Quest III&quot; (which scored 38/40) and &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; (which scored 35/40). It was also one of the magazine&#x27;s five highest-rated games up until 1988, along with &quot;Dragon Quest II&quot; (which scored 38/40) and &quot;Zelda II: The Adventure of Link&quot; (which scored 36/40). The 1989 &quot;All Soft Catalog&quot; issue of &quot;Famicom Tsūshin&quot; included &quot;Final Fantasy II&quot; in its list of the best games of all time, giving it the Best Scenario award. Retrospectively, G4 described the stat-building system as an &quot;Innovation&quot;, noting that &quot;computer RPGs took the &quot;level&quot; system wholesale from tabletop role-playing games and made it a genre staple, but &quot;FF2&quot; eliminated levels altogether&quot;, but that what &quot;sounds novel at first wound up being a huge mess&quot;.

The game&#x27;s re-releases have been more heavily reviewed. &quot;Famitsu&quot; magazine scored the WonderSwan version of the game a 30 out of 40, and GameSpot noted the &quot;Dawn of Souls&quot;″ mostly outdated graphics but praised its length and bonus content. IGN noted the great improvement in the translation of the story over &quot;Final Fantasy I&quot; and the addition of later &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; features, such as being able to save anywhere in the overworld map without a tent or cabin. The &quot;Dawn of Souls&quot; release was named the IGN Game Boy &quot;Game of the Month&quot; for March 2004, and the package was rated 76th in &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;″s Top 200 Games list. The dialogue system was thought to be time consuming and stilted, but was still a milestone for interactivity. The story was considered to be much more involved and deep than the first &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;, as it involved romance and the death of characters. The game&#x27;s plot was thought by some reviewers to mirror elements of &quot;Star Wars: A New Hope&quot; in its use of an orphan joining a rebellion against an empire that was building a massive ship, with a captive princess inside. GameSpy praised the addition of the ability to save the game at any time, calling the feature crucial for a game on a handheld game console, and in contrast to GameSpot, praised the graphics, saying that while they were primitive, they were &quot;well-suited&quot; to the Game Boy Advance.

The PSP version was met with generally average reviews. GameSpot described the &quot;more intriguing&quot; story and &quot;key words&quot; system as &quot;notable&quot; in &quot;the evolution of the series and genre&quot; but called the level up system &quot;chaotic&quot; and noted that unlike previous versions, this was shipped without a version of &quot;Final Fantasy I&quot;. IGN described the &quot;dialogue and story&quot; as &quot;much more interesting than&quot; its predecessor and the &quot;proficiency system not unlike what&#x27;s found in &quot;The Elder Scrolls&quot;&quot; as a &quot;semi-innovation&quot; for its time, but also complained about the gameplay. Both sources praised the graphics, however. GameSpy, while echoing similar complaints about the &quot;quirky and sometimes confusing&quot; leveling system and praises for the graphics, also applauded the supposed decrease in difficulty of the game, which in the reviewers&#x27; opinion eliminated the necessity to abuse the leveling system in order to progress in the game as the player had to do in the original game.

<text>titled Final Fantasy II in its initial North American release, is a 1991 role-playing video game developed and published by Square (now Square Enix) for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. The fourth main installment of the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series, the game&#x27;s story follows Cecil, a dark knight, as he tries to prevent the sorcerer Golbez from seizing powerful crystals and destroying the world. He is joined on this quest by a frequently changing group of allies. &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot; introduced innovations that became staples of the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series and role-playing games in general. Its &quot;Active Time Battle&quot; system was used in five subsequent &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games, and unlike prior games in the series, &quot;IV&quot; gave each character their own unchangeable character class — although at a few points in the story, a dark knight will choose the path of a paladin, or a summoner will evolve to a new tier of spellcasting.

&quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot; has been ported to several other platforms with varying differences. A remake, also called &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot;, with 3D graphics was released for the Nintendo DS in 2007 and 2008. The game was re-titled &quot;Final Fantasy II&quot; during its initial release outside Japan as the original &quot;II&quot; and &quot;III&quot; had not been released outside Japan at the time. All later localizations of &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot;, which began to appear after &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; (released worldwide under that title), used the original title.

The various incarnations of the game have sold more than four million copies worldwide. A sequel, &quot;Final Fantasy IV: The After Years&quot;, was released for Japanese mobile phones in 2008, and worldwide via the Wii Shop Channel on June 1, 2009. In 2011, both &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot; and &quot;The After Years&quot; were released for the PlayStation Portable as part of the compilation &quot;Final Fantasy IV: The Complete Collection&quot;, which also included a new game, set between the two; &quot;Final Fantasy IV: Interlude&quot;. Ports of the Nintendo DS remake were released for iOS in 2012, for Android in 2013 and for Windows in 2014. Another enhanced port of &quot;FFIV&quot; was released as part of the &quot;Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster&quot; compilation series for iOS, Android and Windows in 2021, for Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 in 2023, and for Xbox Series X/S in 2024.

Retrospectively, &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot; is often regarded as one of the greatest video games of all time, noting that it pioneered many now common console role-playing game features, including the concept of dramatic storytelling in an RPG. It has been included in various lists of the best games of all time, by IGN (at #9 in 2003) as the highest-ranking RPG, as well as &quot;Famitsu&quot; in 2006 reader poll among the best games ever made. It also appeared in various rankings for Best Games of All Time for &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; in 2001 and 2006, &quot;Game Informer&quot; in 2001 and 2009, GameSpot in 2005, and GameFAQs in 2005, 2009 and 2014.

==Gameplay==
In &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot;, the player controls a large cast of characters and completes quests to advance the story. Characters move and interact with people and objects on a field map, which may represent a variety of settings, such as towers, caves, and forests. Travel between areas occurs on the overworld. The player can use towns to replenish strength, buy equipment, and discover clues about their next destination. Conversely, the player fights monsters at random intervals on the overworld and in dungeons. In battle, the player has the option to fight, use magic or an item, retreat, change character positions, parry, or pause. Certain characters have special abilities. The game was the first in the series to allow the player to control up to five characters in their party; previous games had limited the party to four.

Player characters and monsters have hit points (HP), with the characters&#x27; HP captioned below the main battle screen. Attacks reduce remaining HP until none are left, at which point the character faints or the monster dies. If all characters are defeated, the game must be restored from a saved game file. The player can restore the characters&#x27; hit points by having them sleep in an inn or use items in the party&#x27;s inventory, such as potions, as well as using healing magic spells. Equipment (such as swords and armor) bought in towns or found in dungeons can be used to increase damage inflicted on monsters or minimize damage received. The player can choose whether characters appear on the front line of a battle or in the back. A character&#x27;s placement impacts damage received and inflicted depending on the type of attack.

&quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot; introduced Square&#x27;s Active Time Battle (ATB) system, which differed from the turn-based designs of previous RPGs. The ATB system centers on the player inputting orders for the characters in real time during battles. The system was used in many subsequent Square games.

Each character has certain strengths and weaknesses; for instance, a strong magic user may have low defense, while a physical fighter may have low agility. Like other &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games, characters gain new, more powerful abilities with battle experience. Magic is classified as either &quot;White&quot; for healing and support; &quot;Black&quot; for offense; or &quot;Summon&quot; (or &quot;call&quot;) for summoning monsters to attack or carry out specialized tasks. A fourth type, &quot;Ninjutsu&quot;, consists of support and offensive magic and is available to only one character. Magic users, who account for eight of the twelve playable characters, gain magic spells at preprogrammed experience levels or fixed story events. The game includes balanced point gains, items, and rewards to eliminate long sessions of grinding. Due to the Super NES&#x27; greater processing power, &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot; contains improved graphics when compared to previous &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; titles, all of which were released on the NES. The game employs the Super NES&#x27; Mode 7 technology to give enhanced magic spell visuals and to make airship travel more dramatic by scaling and tilting the ground for a bird&#x27;s eye view.

==Plot==
===Setting===
Most of &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot; takes place on Earth, also known as the Blue Planet, which consists of a surface world (or Overworld), inhabited by humans, and an underground world (or Underworld), inhabited by the Dwarves. An artificial moon orbits the planet, upon which the Lunarians live. The Lunarians are a race of beings originally from a world which was destroyed, becoming the asteroid belt surrounding the Blue Planet, and are identified by a moon-shape crest on their foreheads. They created the artificial moon, resting until a time when they believe their kind can co-exist with humans. A second, natural moon orbits the Blue Planet as well, although it is never visited in the game.

===Characters===

&quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot; offers twelve playable characters, each with a unique, unchangeable character class. During the game, the player can have a total of five, or fewer, characters in the party at any given time. The main character, Cecil Harvey, is a dark knight and the captain of the Red Wings, an elite air force unit of the kingdom of Baron. He serves the king alongside his childhood friend Kain Highwind, the commander of the Dragoons. Rosa Farrell is a white mage and archer, as well as Cecil&#x27;s love interest. The Red Wings&#x27; airships were constructed by Cecil&#x27;s friend, the engineer Cid Pollendina.

During his quest, Cecil is joined by others, including Rydia, a young summoner from the village of Mist; Tellah, a legendary sage; Edward Chris von Muir, the prince of Damcyan who is a bard as well as the husband of Tellah&#x27;s daughter Anna; Yang Fang Leiden, the head of the monks of Fabul; Palom and Porom, a black mage and a white mage, twin apprentices from the magical village of Mysidia; Edward &quot;Edge&quot; Geraldine, the ninja prince of Eblan; and Fusoya, the guardian of the Lunarians during their long sleep.

Zemus is the main antagonist of the game. He is a Lunarian who wishes to destroy the human race so that his people can populate the earth. He uses Golbez to do this by controlling him and Kain with his psychic powers to activate the Giant of Babil, a huge machine created to carry out the genocide and take over the world.

===Story===

The Red Wings attack the city of Mysidia to steal their Water Crystal, and return to the Kingdom of Baron. Afterwards, when Cecil, Captain of the Red Wings, questions the king&#x27;s motives, he is stripped of his rank and sent with Kain, his friend and Captain of the Dragoons, to deliver a ring to the Village of Mist. There, Kain and Cecil watch in horror as monsters burst forth from inside the ring and lay waste to the village. A young girl, Rydia, is the only survivor and summons a monster named Titan in anger. This monster causes an earthquake, separating Cecil and Kain. Cecil awakens afterward and takes the wounded Rydia to a nearby inn. Baron soldiers come for Rydia but Cecil defends her, and she joins him on his journey.

It is revealed that Rosa, Cecil&#x27;s love interest, had followed him and is extremely ill with a fever. Soon after this, Cecil and Rydia meet Tellah, who is going to Damcyan Castle to retrieve his eloping daughter, Anna. However, Anna is killed when the Red Wings bomb the castle. Edward, Anna&#x27;s lover and the prince of Damcyan, who is also a spoony bard, explains that the Red Wings&#x27; new commander, Golbez, did this to steal the Fire Crystal for Baron as they had stolen the Water Crystal from Mysidia. Tellah leaves the party to exact revenge on Golbez for Anna&#x27;s death. After finding a cure for Rosa, the party decides to go to Fabul to protect the Wind Crystal. On the way there they meet Master Yang, a warrior monk serviced to the kingdom and the protection of the crystal. The Red Wings attack Fabul, and Kain reappears as one of Golbez&#x27;s servants. He attacks and defeats Cecil; when Rosa intervenes, Golbez kidnaps her and Kain takes the crystal. On the way back to Baron, the party is attacked by Leviathan and separated.

Cecil awakes alone near Mysidia. When he enters the town, he finds that its residents deeply resent him for the prior attack on their town. Through the Elder of Mysidia, he learns that to defeat Golbez, he must climb Mt. Ordeals and become a Paladin. Before embarking on his journey, he is joined by the twin mages, Palom and Porom. On the mountain he encounters Tellah, who is searching for the forbidden spell Meteor to defeat Golbez. After defeating the fiend Scarmiglione and casting aside the darkness within himself, Cecil becomes a Paladin, while Tellah learns the secret of Meteor. Upon reaching Baron, the party discovers an amnesiac Yang and return him to his senses. The party then confronts the King, only to discover that he is an imposter and one of Golbez&#x27;s minions, Cagnazzo. After defeating him, Cid arrives and takes them to one of his airships, the &quot;Enterprise&quot;. On the way, the party enters a room booby-trapped by Cagnazzo, where Palom and Porom sacrifice themselves to save Cecil, Tellah, Cid, and Yang.

On the airship, Kain appears and demands Cecil retrieve the final crystal in exchange for Rosa&#x27;s life, which the party obtains with assistance from a bedridden Edward. Kain then leads the party to the Tower of Zot, where Rosa is imprisoned. At the tower&#x27;s summit, Golbez takes the crystal and attempts to flee. Tellah casts Meteor to stop Golbez, sacrificing his own life in the process, but the spell only weakens Golbez, ending his mind control of Kain. Kain helps Cecil rescue Rosa, and defeat Barbariccia another fiend before Rosa teleports the party out of the collapsing tower to Baron.

In Baron, Kain reveals that Golbez must also obtain four subterranean &quot;Dark Crystals&quot; to achieve his goal of reaching the Moon. The party travels to the underworld and encounter the Dwarves, who are currently fighting the Red Wings. They defeat Golbez thanks to a sudden appearance by Rydia, now a young woman due to her time spent in the Feymarch, the home of the Eidolons. However, the party ultimately fails to prevent Golbez from stealing the Dwarves&#x27; crystal. With the help of the Dwarves, they enter the Tower of Babil in order to obtain the crystals Golbez has stored there, only to find that they have been moved to a surface portion of the tower. Yang later sacrifices himself in order to stop the tower&#x27;s cannons from firing on the Dwarves (though he&#x27;s later revealed to have survived). After escaping a trap set by Golbez, the party flees the underworld aboard the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, with Cid sacrificing himself to reseal the passage between the two worlds and to prevent the Red Wings from continuing their pursuit. The party, now joined by Edge, the prince of Eblan, travels back to the Tower of Babil in order to take back the stolen crystals and revenge himself upon Rubicante the last of the fiends. Upon reaching the crystal room, however, the party falls through a trap door to the underworld. Meeting with the Dwarves once again and finding Cid to be alive, the party sets out to retrieve the eighth crystal before Golbez can. When the crystal is obtained, Golbez appears and reveals he still has control over Kain, while taking the crystal for himself. After learning of the &quot;Lunar Whale&quot;, a ship designed to take travelers to and from the moon, the party return to Mysidia where the town&#x27;s Elder and mages summon the ship.

Arriving on the Moon, the party meets the sage Fusoya, who explains that Cecil&#x27;s father was a Lunarian. Fusoya also explains that a Lunarian named Zemus plans to destroy life on the Blue Planet so that the Lunarians can take over, using Golbez to summon the Giant of Babil, a colossal robot. The party returns to Earth and the forces of the two worlds attack the Giant, including Palom and Porom, who have been revived. After the party breaks the robot, Golbez and Kain confront them, only to have Fusoya break Zemus&#x27; control over Golbez, in turn releasing Kain. Cecil learns that Golbez is his older brother. Golbez and Fusoya head to the core of the Moon to defeat Zemus, and Cecil&#x27;s party follows. In the Moon&#x27;s core, the party witnesses Golbez and Fusoya kill Zemus, but then quickly fall to an evil spirit named Zeromus, the embodiment of all of Zemus&#x27; hatred and rage. Back on Earth, the Elder of Mysidia entreats all of Cecil&#x27;s allies and friends to pray for the party, which gives Cecil and his allies the strength to fight and destroy Zeromus. Following the battle, Fusoya and Golbez opt to leave Earth with the moon. Cecil, at last accepting the truth, acknowledges Golbez as his brother, and bids him farewell.

During the epilogue, most of the cast reunites to celebrate Cecil and Rosa&#x27;s wedding and their coronation as Baron&#x27;s new king and queen, while Kain is seen atop Mount Ordeals, having vowed to atone for his misdeeds.

==Development==
After completing &quot;Final Fantasy III&quot; in 1990, Square planned to develop two &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games—one for the Famicom and the other for the forthcoming Super Famicom, to be known as &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot; and &quot;V&quot; respectively. Due to financial and scheduling constraints, Square dropped plans for the Famicom game and continued development of the Super Famicom version, retitled &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot;. A mock-up screenshot of the cancelled title was produced for a Japanese magazine, but little other information exists about it. Series creator and director Hironobu Sakaguchi has stated that the Famicom version was approximately 80% complete and certain ideas were reused for the Super Famicom version.

&quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot; was lead designer Takashi Tokita&#x27;s first project at Square as a full-time employee. Before this, Tokita wanted a career as a theater actor, but working on the game made him decide to become a &quot;great creator&quot; of video games. Initially Hiromichi Tanaka, the main designer of &quot;Final Fantasy III&quot;, was also involved in the development of the game. However, Tanaka wanted to create a seamless battle system that had no separate battle screen and was not menu-driven, and since &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot; was not going in that direction, he changed development teams to work on the action RPG &quot;Secret of Mana&quot; instead. According to Tanaka, he originally wanted the title to have a &quot;more action-based, dynamic overworld&quot; but it &quot;wound up not being&quot; &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot; anymore, instead becoming a separate project that eventually became &quot;Seiken Densetsu 2&quot; (&quot;Secret of Mana&quot;), which was codenamed &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; during development. The development team of &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot; contained 14 people in total, and the game was completed in roughly one year.

Initial ideas were contributed by Sakaguchi, including the entire story and the name of Baron&#x27;s royal air force, the &quot;Red Wings&quot;. The Active Time Battle (ATB) system was conceived and designed by Hiroyuki Ito when he was inspired while watching a Formula One race and seeing racers pass each other at different speeds. This gave him the idea of different speed values for the individual characters. The system was developed by Kazuhiko Aoki, Ito and Akihiko Matsui. As the game&#x27;s lead designer, Tokita wrote the scenario and contributed pixel art. He said that there was a lot of pressure and that the project would not have been completed if he did not work diligently on it. According to Tokita, &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot; was designed with the best parts of the previous three installments in mind: the job system of &quot;Final Fantasy III&quot;, the focus on story of the second game, and the four elemental bosses acting as &quot;symbols for the game&quot; as in the first installment. Other influences include &quot;Dragon Quest II&quot;. The themes of the game were to go &quot;from darkness to light&quot; with Cecil, a focus on family and friendship among the large and diverse cast, and the idea that &quot;brute strength alone isn&#x27;t power&quot;. Tokita feels that &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot; is the first game in the series to really pick up on drama, and the first Japanese RPG to feature deep characters and plot.

The game&#x27;s script had to be reduced to one fourth of its original length due to cartridge storage limits, but Tokita made sure only &quot;unnecessary dialogue&quot; was cut, rather than actual story elements. As the graphical capacities of the Super Famicom allowed regular series character designer Yoshitaka Amano to make more elaborate character designs than in the previous installments, with the characters&#x27; personalities already evident from the images, Tokita felt the reduced script length improved the pacing of the game. Still, he acknowledges that some parts of the story were &quot;unclear&quot; or were not &quot;looked at in depth&quot; until later ports and remakes. One of the ideas not included, due to time and space constraints, was a dungeon near the end of the game where each character would have to progress on their own—this dungeon would only be included in the Game Boy Advance version of the game, as the Lunar Ruins.

===Music===

The score of &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot; was written by longtime series composer Nobuo Uematsu. Uematsu has noted that the process of composing was excruciating, involving trial and error and requiring the sound staff to spend several nights in sleeping bags at Square&#x27;s headquarters. His liner notes were humorously signed as being written at 1:30 AM &quot;in the office, naturally&quot;. The score was well received; reviewers have praised the quality of the composition despite the limited medium. The track &quot;Theme of Love&quot; has even been taught to Japanese school children as part of the music curriculum. Uematsu continues to perform certain pieces in his &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; concert series.

Three albums of music from &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot; have been released in Japan. The first album, &quot;Final Fantasy IV: Original Sound Version&quot;, was released on June 14, 1991, and contains 44 tracks from the game. The second album, &quot;Final Fantasy IV: Celtic Moon&quot;, was released on October 24 the same year, and contains a selection of tracks from the game, arranged and performed by Celtic musician Máire Breatnach. Lastly, &quot;Final Fantasy IV Piano Collections&quot;, an arrangement of tracks for solo piano performed by Toshiyuki Mori, was released on April 21, 1992, and began the &quot;Piano Collections&quot; trend for each successive &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; game. Several tracks have appeared on &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; compilation albums produced by Square, including &quot;The Black Mages&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy: Pray&quot;. Independent but officially licensed releases of &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot; music have been orchestrated by such groups as Project Majestic Mix, which focuses on arranging video game music. Selections also appear on Japanese remix albums, called dōjin music, and on English remixing websites such as OverClocked ReMix.

===North American localization===

Because the previous two installments of the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series had not been localized and released in North America at the time, &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot; was distributed as &quot;Final Fantasy II&quot; to maintain naming continuity. This remained the norm until the release of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; in North America (after the release of &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; under the title of &quot;Final Fantasy III&quot;) and subsequent releases of the original &quot;Final Fantasy II&quot; and &quot;III&quot; on various platforms. The game has since gone under the title &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot; in all subsequent ports.

The English localization of &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot; retains the storyline, graphics, and sound of the original, but the developers significantly reduced the difficulty for beginning gamers. Square was worried that western fans would find it difficult to adjust to the game&#x27;s complexity due to not having played the previous two entries, so decreased the overall depth considerably. Other changes include the removal of overt Judeo-Christian religious references and certain potentially objectionable graphics. For example, the magic spell &quot;Holy&quot; was renamed &quot;White&quot;, and all references to prayer were eliminated; the Tower of Prayers in Mysidia was renamed the Tower of Wishes. Direct references to death were also omitted, although several characters clearly die during the course of the game. The translation was changed in accordance with Nintendo of America&#x27;s censorship policies (at a time before the formation of the ESRB and its rating system).

==Re-releases==

In addition to its original release, &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot; has been remade into many different versions. The first of these was &quot;Final Fantasy IV Easy Type&quot;, a modified version of the game which was released for the Super Famicom in Japan. In this version, the attack powers of weapons have been enhanced, while the protective abilities of certain spells and pieces of armor are amplified. The American release is partially based on &quot;Easy Type&quot;.

A PlayStation port debuted in Japan on March 21, 1997. Ported by Tose and published by Square, it was designed and directed by Kazuhiko Aoki, supervised by Fumiaki Fukaya, and produced by Akihiro Imai. This version is identical to the original game, although minor tweaks introduced in the &quot;Easy Type&quot; are present. The most notable changes in the PlayStation release are the inclusion of a full motion video opening and ending sequence, the ability to move quickly in dungeons and towns by holding the Cancel button, and the option of performing a &quot;memo&quot; save anywhere on the world map. This version was released a second time in Japan in March 1999 as part of the &quot;Final Fantasy Collection&quot; package, which also included the PlayStation versions of &quot;Final Fantasy V&quot; and &quot;VI&quot;. Fifty-thousand limited edition copies of the collection were also released and included a &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;-themed alarm clock.

The PlayStation port was later released with &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; in North America as part of &quot;Final Fantasy Chronicles&quot; in 2001 and with &quot;Final Fantasy V&quot; in Europe and Australia as part of &quot;Final Fantasy Anthology&quot; in 2002. The English localizations feature a new translation, although certain translated lines from the previous localization by Kaoru Moriyama, such as &quot;You spoony bard!&quot;, were kept, as they had become fan favorites. A remake for the WonderSwan Color, with few changes from the PlayStation version, was released in Japan on March 28, 2002. Character sprites and backgrounds were graphically enhanced through heightened details and color shading.

&quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot; was ported again by Tose for the Game Boy Advance and published as . It was released in North America by Nintendo of America on December 12, 2005; in Japan by Square Enix on December 15; in Australia on February 23, 2006; and in Europe on June 2. In Japan, a special version was available which included a limited edition Game Boy Micro with a themed face plate featuring artwork of Cecil and Kain. The enhanced graphics from the WonderSwan Color port were further improved, and minor changes were made to the music. The localization team revised the English translation, improving the flow of the story, and restoring plot details absent from the original. The abilities that were removed from the original North American release were re-added, while spells were renamed to follow the naming conventions of the Japanese version, changing &quot;Bolt2&quot; to &quot;Thundara&quot; for example. A new cave at Mt. Ordeals was added featuring powerful armor and stronger weapons for five additional characters, as was the Lunar Ruins, a dungeon accessible only at the end of the game.

The game was remade with 3D graphics for the Nintendo DS as part of the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series&#x27; 20th anniversary, and was released as &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot; in Japan on December 20, 2007, in North America on July 22, 2008, and in Europe on September 5. The remake adds a number of features not present in the original, such as voice acting, minigames, and some changes to the basic gameplay. The game was developed by Matrix Software, the same team responsible for the &quot;Final Fantasy III&quot; DS remake, and was supervised by members of the original development team: Takashi Tokita served as executive producer and director, Tomoya Asano as producer and Hiroyuki Ito as battle designer. Animator Yoshinori Kanada storyboarded the new cutscenes.

The original version of the game was released on the Wii Virtual Console in Japan on August 4, 2009, and in PAL regions on June 11, 2010. An enhanced port for i-mode compatible phones was released in Japan on October 5, 2009. It retains features introduced in the Wonderswan Color and Game Boy Advance ports, while incorporating enhanced character graphics on par with those found in &quot;The After Years&quot;, as well as an exclusive &quot;extra dungeon&quot; available after completing the game.

Along with &quot;Final Fantasy IV: The After Years&quot;, the game was released for the PlayStation Portable as part of the compilation &quot;Final Fantasy IV: The Complete Collection&quot;. This version used updated 2D graphics, as opposed to the 3D graphics seen in the DS remake. The collection also includes a new episode called &quot;Final Fantasy IV: Interlude&quot;, which takes place between the original game and &quot;The After Years&quot;. Masashi Hamauzu arranged the main theme for the game. It was released worldwide in April 2011, with the exception of Japan in March. The PlayStation port was re-released as part of the &quot;Final Fantasy 25th Anniversary Ultimate Box&quot; Japanese package in December 2012.

In December 2012, the Nintendo DS version of &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot; was released for the iOS and Android (June 2013) mobile platforms, introducing an optional easier difficulty level. &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot; was also released for Windows in September 2014, with no prior advertisement.

The PlayStation version was released as a PSOne Classic in Japan on June 27, 2012, compatible with PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita and PlayStation Portable.

The Super Famicom version was released on the Wii U Virtual Console in Japan on February 19, 2014, while the Game Boy Advance version was released on April 13, 2016.

==Reception==
The game received positive reviews upon release. &quot;Famitsu&quot;″s panel of four reviewers gave it ratings of 9, 9, 10, and 8, adding up to an overall score of 36 out of 40, one of the highest scores it awarded to any game in 1991, second only to &quot;The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past&quot;. In its November 1991 issue, &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; proclaimed it set a &quot;new standard of excellence&quot; for role-playing games. They praised the battles as being &quot;more interesting than in previous RPGs&quot; because the player &quot;must make snap decisions&quot; and the &quot;enemies don&#x27;t wait for you to make up your mind&quot; and concluded that the &quot;story, graphics, play and sound will keep fans riveted&quot;. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;″ panel of four reviewers gave it ratings of 8, 9, 7, and 8, out of 10, adding up to 32 out of 40 overall. In its December 1991 issue, Ed Semrad, who gave it a 9, wrote that &quot;Square has just redefined what the ultimate RPG should be like&quot;, noting the &quot;spectacular Mode 7 effects, outstanding graphics and a quest unequalled in a video game&quot;, concluding that it &quot;makes use of all the Super NES has to offer&quot; and is &quot;the best made to date!&quot; Ken Williams (as Sushi-X), who gave it an 8, said that it is &quot;a totally awesome RPG&quot;, the &quot;storyline is actually coherent and the plot moves along with a combination of speaking sequences and battles&quot;. On the other hand, Martin Alessi, who disliked role-playing games, gave it a 7. They gave the game an award for 1991&#x27;s Best RPG Video Game, stating that the &quot;Mode 7 is great here and Square does a spectacular job in using it to zoom in and away from the planet&quot; and that the &quot;quest is huge and also one of the most difficult ever attempted in a video game&quot;.

&quot;GamePro&quot; rated it a perfect 5.0 out of 5 in all five categories (graphics, sound, control, fun factor, and challenge) in its March 1992 issue. The reviewer Monty Haul stated that it &quot;truly redefines the standards for fantasy adventure games&quot;, proclaiming that &quot;one-dimensional characters, needless hack &#x27;em combat, and linear gameplay will be things of the past if other RPGs learn a lesson or two from this cart&quot;, concluding that it &quot;is one small step for Square Soft, and one giant leap for SNES role-playing games&quot;. In the November 1993 issue of &quot;Dragon&quot;, Sandy Petersen gave it an &quot;Excellent&quot; rating. He criticized the &quot;stylized&quot; combat system and the graphics as &quot;inferior&quot; to &quot;Zelda&quot;, but praised how every &quot;spell has a different on-screen effect&quot; and the difficulty for being &quot;just about right&quot; where bosses &quot;nearly beat you every time&quot; unlike other RPGs such as &quot;Ultima&quot; where enough &quot;adventuring&quot; makes it possible to &quot;trash&quot; enemies &quot;with ease&quot;. He praised the &quot;great&quot; music, preferring it over &quot;Zelda&quot;, stating what it &quot;lacks in graphics, it more than makes up for in sound&quot;. He praised the story in particular, noting that, in a departure from other RPGs where the party always &quot;sticks together through thick and thin&quot;, the characters have their own motives for joining and leaving the group, with one that &quot;even betrays&quot; them. He said that it is like &quot;following the storyline of a fantasy novel&quot;, comparing it to &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;Man in the Iron Mask&quot;, concluding that, because &quot;the characters often spoke up for themselves&quot;, he &quot;got much more attached&quot; to the party &quot;than in any other computer game&quot;.

Retrospectively, major reviewers have called &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot; one of the greatest video games of all time, noting that it pioneered many now common console role-playing game features, including the concept of dramatic storytelling in an RPG. In a 1997 retrospective, &quot;GamePro&quot; credited it as &quot;the first game where a turn-based combat system allowed you to change weapons, cast spells, and use items during a battle, and it featured some of the most exciting villains to date&quot;. Reviewers have praised the game for its graphics, gameplay and score, and have noted that &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot; was one of the first role-playing games to feature a complex, involving plot. However, some retrospective reviews have criticized the game&#x27;s original English-language translation.

It has been included in various lists of the best games of all time. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; included it in the &quot;100 Greatest Nintendo Games&quot; lists, placing it ninth in 1997&#x27;s issue 100, and twenty-eighth in 2005&#x27;s issue 200. IGN included it in its top 100 lists of the greatest games of all time, ranking it #9 in 2003, as the highest-ranking RPG, and at #26 in 2005, as the highest rated &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; title on the list. In 2007, it was ranked at #55, behind &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot;. &quot;Famitsu&quot; released a reader poll in 2006 ranking it as the sixth best game ever made. It was also listed among the best games of all time by &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; in 2001 and 2006, &quot;Game Informer&quot; in 2001 and 2009, GameSpot in 2005, and GameFAQs in 2005, 2009 and 2014.

&quot;Weekly Famitsu&quot; gave &quot;Final Fantasy Collection&quot; a score of 54 out of 60 points, scored by a panel of six reviewers. The Game Boy Advance version, &quot;Final Fantasy IV Advance&quot;, was met with praise from reviewers, although a few noted the game&#x27;s graphics do not hold up well to current games, especially when compared to &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;. Reviewers noted that some fans may still nitpick certain errors in the new translation. The Nintendo DS version of the game was praised for its visuals, gameplay changes and new cutscenes. It was a nominee for Best RPG on the Nintendo DS in IGN&#x27;s 2008 video game awards.

===Sales===
Upon release in Japan, &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot; sold about cartridges on its first day, about less than what &quot;Final Fantasy V&quot; sold on its first day a year later, no doubt because audiences were hoping for more of the same. The Super Famicom version of &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot; went on to sell copies in Japan.

The PlayStation version sold an additional 261,000 copies in Japan in 1997. By March 2003, the game, including the PlayStation and WonderSwan Color remakes, had shipped 2.16 million copies worldwide, with 1.82 million of those copies being shipped in Japan and 340,000 abroad. The Game Boy Advance version of the game sold over 219,000 copies in Japan by the end of 2006. As of 2007, just before the release of the Nintendo DS version, nearly 3 million copies of the game had been sold around the world. By May 2009, the DS version of the game had sold 1.1 million copies worldwide. According to Steam Spy, another 190,000 copies of the PC version were sold by April 2018.

In addition, &quot;Final Fantasy Collection&quot;, which includes &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot;, sold over 400,000 copies in 1999. This makes it the 31st best selling release of that year in Japan.

==Legacy==
&quot;Final Fantasy IV: The After Years&quot;, the sequel to &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot;, is set seventeen years after the events of the original. The first two chapters of the game were released in Japan in February 2008 for NTT DoCoMo FOMA 903i series phones, and for au WIN BREW series phones in spring. The game revolves around Ceodore, the son of Cecil and Rosa, with most of the original cast members returning, some of whom are featured in more prominent roles than before, among other new characters. After the mobile release, &quot;The After Years&quot; was released outside Japan, for Wii&#x27;s WiiWare service. The first two chapters were released in June 2009, in North America and PAL territories, with the additional chapters being released in the following months.

A two-volume novelization of &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot; was released in Japan on December 25, 2008.

<text>also known as Final Fantasy III from its initial North American release, is a 1994 role-playing video game developed and published by Square for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It is the sixth main entry in the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series, the final to feature 2D sprite based graphics, and the first to be directed by someone other than series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi; the role was instead filled by Yoshinori Kitase and Hiroyuki Ito. Long-time collaborator Yoshitaka Amano returned as character designer and concept artist, while composer Nobuo Uematsu returned to compose the game&#x27;s score, which has been released on several soundtrack albums.

Set in a world with technology resembling the Second Industrial Revolution, the game&#x27;s story follows an expanding cast that includes fourteen permanent playable characters. The game&#x27;s themes of a rebellion against an immoral military dictatorship, pursuit of a magical arms race, use of chemical weapons in warfare, depictions of violent and apocalyptic confrontations, several personal redemption arcs, teenage pregnancy, and the renewal of hope and life itself, indicated as a groundbreaking opposite of the entire narrative due to its progressive darker and more mature themes than earlier entries in the franchise.

&quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; received widespread critical acclaim, particularly for its graphics, soundtrack, story, characters, and setting. It is widely considered to be one of the greatest video games ever made and is often cited as a watershed title for the role-playing genre. The game was a commercial success, with the Super NES and PlayStation versions selling over 3.48 million copies worldwide by 2003, as well as over 750,000 copies as part of the Japanese &quot;Final Fantasy Collection&quot; and the North American &quot;Final Fantasy Anthology&quot;.

It was ported by Tose with minor differences to the PlayStation in 1999, and the Game Boy Advance in 2006. The Super NES version was rereleased for the Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console in 2011, and by Nintendo as part of the company&#x27;s Super NES Classic Edition in 2017. The game was known as &quot;Final Fantasy III&quot; when it was first released in North America, as the original &quot;Final Fantasy II&quot;, &quot;III&quot;, and &quot;V&quot; had not been released outside Japan at the time (leaving &quot;IV&quot; as the second title released outside Japan and &quot;VI&quot; as the third). However, all later versions of the game, other than re-releases of the original version, use the original title.

==Gameplay==
Like previous installments, &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; consists of four basic modes of gameplay: an overworld map, town and dungeon field maps, a battle screen, and a menu screen. The overworld map is a scaled-down version of the game&#x27;s world, which the player uses to direct characters to various locations. As with most games in the series, the three primary means of travel across the overworld are by foot, chocobo, and airship. With a few plot-driven exceptions, enemies are randomly encountered on field maps and on the overworld when traveling by foot. The menu screen is where the player makes such decisions as which characters will be in the traveling party, which equipment they wield, the magic they learn, and the configuration of the gameplay. It is also used to track experience points and levels.

The game&#x27;s plot develops as the player progresses through towns and dungeons. Town citizens will offer helpful information, and some residents own item or equipment shops. Later in the game, visiting certain towns will activate side-quests. Dungeons appear as a variety of areas, including caves, forests, and buildings. These dungeons often have treasure chests containing rare items that are not available in most stores. Dungeons may feature puzzles and mazes, with some dungeons requiring the player to divide the characters into multiple parties which must work together to advance through the dungeon.

===Combat===
Combat in &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; is menu-based, in which the player selects an action from a list of such options as Fight, Magic, and Item. A maximum of four characters may be used in battles, which are based on the series&#x27; traditional Active Time Battle (ATB) system, first featured in &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot;. Under this system, each character has an action bar that replenishes itself at a rate dependent on their speed statistic. When a character&#x27;s action bar is filled, the player may assign an action. In addition to standard battle techniques, each character possesses a unique special ability. For example, Locke possesses the ability to steal items from enemies, while Celes&#x27; &quot;Runic&quot; ability allows her to absorb most magical attacks cast until her next turn.

Another element is the Desperation Attack, a powerful attack substitution that occasionally appears when a character&#x27;s health is low. Similar features appear in later &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; titles under a variety of different names, including Limit Breaks, Trances, and Overdrives. Characters are rewarded for victorious battles with experience points and money, called gil (Gold Piece (GP) in the original North American localization). When characters attain a certain number of experience points, they gain a level, which increases their statistics. An additional player may play during battle scenarios, with control of individual characters assigned from the configuration menu.

===Customization===
Characters in &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; can be equipped with a variety of weapons, armor and, particular to this entry, powerful accessories known as &quot;Relics&quot;. Weapons and armor increase combat capability, mostly by increasing statistics and adding beneficial effects to attacks. By comparison, Relics have a variety of uses and effects, are almost entirely interchangeable among party members, and are extended in sophistication to alter basic battle commands and exceed normal limitations of the game&#x27;s systems.

Although in &quot;VI&quot; only two playable characters start the game with the ability to use magic, magic may later be taught to almost all other playable characters through the game&#x27;s introduction of magicite and the Espers that magicite shards contain. &quot;Espers&quot; are the game&#x27;s incarnation of the series&#x27; trope of &quot;summons&quot;, powerful monstrous beings, many of which are recurring throughout the series, such as Ifrit, Shiva, Bahamut and Odin. Besides those returning from previous entries, &quot;VI&quot; features approximately two dozen of them in total, with more added to later versions of the game.

The setting and plot of the game revolve heavily around Espers and their remains when deceased, which are referred to as &quot;magicite&quot;. Each piece of magicite has a specific set of magic spells that a character can learn when they are equipped with it in the menu. If used often enough, these abilities become permanently accessible, even if the magicite is removed. Additionally, some pieces of magicite grant a statistical bonus to a character when they gain a level. Finally, when a character equips a piece of magicite, they may summon the corresponding Esper during battle.

==Plot==
===Setting===
Instead of the strictly medieval fantasy settings featured in previous &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; titles, &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; is set in a world that also has prominent steampunk influences. The structure of society is similar to that of the latter half of the 19th century, with opera and the fine arts serving as recurring motifs throughout the game, and a level of technology comparable to that of the Second Industrial Revolution. During the first half of the game, the planet is referred to as the World of Balance, and is divided into three lush continents. The northern continent is punctuated by a series of mountain ranges, the southern continent has been mostly subjugated by the cruel Gestahl Empire, and the eastern continent is home to the Veldt, a massive wilderness inhabited by monsters from all over the world. An apocalyptic event mid-game transforms the planet into the World of Ruin; its withering landmasses are fractured into numerous islands surrounding a larger continent.

The game alludes to a conflict known as the &quot;War of the Magi&quot;, which occurred one thousand years prior to the beginning of the game. In this conflict, three quarreling entities known as the &quot;Warring Triad&quot; used innocent humans as soldiers by transforming them into enslaved magical beings called Espers. The Triad realized their wrongdoings; they freed the espers and sealed their own powers inside three stone statues. As a precaution, the espers sealed off both the statues and themselves from the realm of humans. The concept of magic gradually faded to myth as mankind built a society extolling science and technology. At the game&#x27;s opening, the Empire has taken advantage of the weakening barrier between the human and esper domains, capturing several espers in the process. Using these espers as a power source, the Empire has created &quot;Magitek&quot;, a craft that combines magic with machinery (including mechanical infantry) and infuses humans with magical powers. The Empire is opposed by the Returners, a rebel organization seeking to free the subjugated lands.

===Characters===

&quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; features fourteen permanent playable characters, the most of any game in the main series, as well as several secondary characters who are only briefly controlled by the player. The starting character, Terra Branford, is a reserved half-human, half-esper girl who spent most of her life as a slave to the Empire, thanks to a mind-controlling device, and is unfamiliar with love. Other primary characters include Locke Cole, a treasure hunter and rebel sympathizer with a powerful impulse to protect women; Celes Chere, a former general of the Empire, who joined the Returners after being jailed for questioning imperial practices; Edgar Roni Figaro, a consummate womanizer and the king of Figaro, who claims allegiance to the Empire while secretly supplying aid to the Returners; Sabin Rene Figaro, Edgar&#x27;s independent brother, who fled the royal court to hone his martial arts skills; Cyan Garamonde, a loyal knight to the kingdom of Doma who lost his family and friends when Kefka poisoned the kingdom&#x27;s water supply; Setzer Gabbiani, a habitual gambler, thrill seeker, and owner of the world&#x27;s only known airship; Shadow, a ninja mercenary who offers his services to both the Empire and the Returners; Relm Arrowny, a young but tough artistic girl with magical powers; Strago Magus, Relm&#x27;s elderly grandfather and a Blue Mage; Gau, a feral child surviving since infancy on the Veldt; Mog, a pike-toting Moogle from the mines of Narshe; Umaro, a savage but loyal yeti also from Narshe, talked into joining the Returners through Mog&#x27;s persuasion; and Gogo, a mysterious, fully shrouded master of the art of mimicry.

Most of the main characters in the game hold a significant grudge against the Empire and, in particular, Kefka Palazzo, who is one of the game&#x27;s main antagonists along with Emperor Gestahl. The clownish Kefka became the first experimental prototype of a line of magically empowered soldiers called Magitek Knights, rendering him insane; his actions throughout the game reflect his demented nature. The supporting character Ultros is a recurring villain and comic relief. A handful of characters have reappeared in later games. &quot;Final Fantasy SGI&quot;, a short tech demo produced for the Silicon Graphics Onyx workstation, featured polygon-based 3D renderings of Locke, Terra, and Shadow.

===Story===
In the town of Narshe, Terra participates in an Imperial mission to seize a powerful Esper encased in ice. Upon locating it, a magical reaction occurs between Terra and the Esper; as a result, the soldiers accompanying Terra are killed and Terra is knocked unconscious. Upon awakening, Terra is informed that the Empire had been using a device called a &quot;slave crown&quot; to control her actions. With the crown now removed, Terra cannot remember anything more than her name and her rare ability to use magic unaided. Terra is then introduced to an organization known as the &quot;Returners&quot;, who she agrees to help in their revolution against the Empire. The Returners learn that Imperial soldiers, led by Kefka, are planning another attempt to seize the frozen Esper. After repelling Kefka&#x27;s attack, Terra experiences another magical reaction with the frozen Esper; she transforms into a creature resembling an Esper and flies to another continent. Upon locating Terra, the party is confronted by an Esper named Ramuh, who informs the group that Terra may require the assistance of another Esper imprisoned in the Imperial capital city of Vector.

At Vector, the party attempts to rescue several Espers; however, the Espers are already dying from Magitek experiments and choose instead to offer their lives to the party by transforming into magicite. The group returns to Terra and observes a reaction between her and the magicite &quot;Maduin&quot;. The reaction calms Terra and restores her memory; she reveals that she is the half-human, half-Esper child of Maduin and a human woman. With this revelation, the Returners ask Terra to convince the Espers to join their cause. To do this, she travels to the sealed gate between the human and Esper worlds. However, unbeknownst to the party, the Empire also uses Terra to gain access to the Esper world. There, Emperor Gestahl and Kefka retrieve the statues of the Warring Triad, raising a landmass called the Floating Continent. The group confronts Emperor Gestahl and Kefka at the Floating Continent, whereupon Kefka, whose mental state has progressively deteriorated over the course of the story, usurps and murders Gestahl. Kefka then tampers with the alignment of the statues, which upsets the balance of magic and destroys most of the surface of the world.

One year later, Celes awakens on a deserted island. She learns that Kefka is using the Warring Triad to rule the world in a tyrannical god-like manner, destroying whole villages who oppose him and causing all life to slowly wither away. After Celes escapes the island, she searches for her lost comrades, who are found scattered throughout the ruined world. They come to terms with their situation and resolve to confront Kefka and end his reign, with Terra additionally accepting her half-Esper heritage and finding a new purpose in life in fighting for a better future. The group infiltrates Kefka&#x27;s tower and destroys the Warring Triad before confronting Kefka himself, who has descended into nihilism as a result of his madness and plans to destroy all of existence as a means of self-validation. However, the group successfully destroys Kefka in battle, at which point magic and Espers disappear from the world; despite this, Terra is able to survive by hanging onto the human half of her existence. The group escapes from Kefka&#x27;s tower as it collapses and flies away while watching as the world rejuvenates itself.

==Development==
===Creation===
&quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; entered development after the release of its predecessor &quot;V&quot; in December 1992. The development of the game took just one year to complete. Series creator and director Hironobu Sakaguchi could not be as intimately involved as in previous installments due to his other projects and his promotion to Executive Vice President of the company in 1991. For that reason, he became the producer and split director responsibilities for &quot;VI&quot; up between Yoshinori Kitase and Hiroyuki Ito: Kitase was in charge of event production and the scenario, while Ito handled all battle aspects. Sakaguchi supervised Kitase&#x27;s cutscene direction and ensured that the project would coalesce as a whole. The idea behind the story of &quot;VI&quot; was that every character is the protagonist. All members of the development team contributed ideas for characters and their &quot;episodes&quot; for the overall plot in what Kitase described as a &quot;hybrid process&quot;. Consequently, Terra and Locke were conceived by Sakaguchi; Celes and Gau by Kitase; Shadow and Setzer by graphic director Tetsuya Nomura; and Edgar and Sabin by field graphic designer Kaori Tanaka.

It was Kitase&#x27;s task to unite the story premise provided by Sakaguchi with all the individual ideas for character episodes to create a cohesive narrative. The scenario of &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; was written by a group of four or five people, among them Kitase who provided key elements of the story, such as the opera scene and Celes&#x27; suicide attempt, as well as all of Kefka&#x27;s appearances. The team decided to split the game into two halves, commonly termed the World of Balance and World of Ruin, because they were tired of the common game scenario of the hero narrowly saving the world. When writing the post-apocalypse second half of the story, the developers decided to let the player choose their favorite characters to emphasize that every character is the protagonist.

Regular series character designer Yoshitaka Amano&#x27;s concept art became the basis for the models in the full motion videos produced for the game&#x27;s PlayStation re-release. Tetsuya Takahashi, one of the graphic directors, drew the imperial Magitek Armors seen in the opening scene. By doing so, he disregarded Sakaguchi&#x27;s intention to reuse the regular designs from elsewhere in the game. The sprite art for the characters&#x27; in-game appearance was drawn by Kazuko Shibuya. While in the earlier installments, the sprites were less detailed on the map than in battle, &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; had an equally high resolution regardless of the screen. This enabled the use of animations depicting a variety of movements and facial expressions. Though it was not the first game to utilize the Super NES&#x27; Mode 7 graphics, &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; made more extensive use of them than its predecessors. For instance, unlike both &quot;IV&quot; and &quot;V&quot;, the world map is rendered in Mode 7, which lends a somewhat three-dimensional perspective to an otherwise two-dimensional game.

===Localization===
The original North American localization and release of &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; by Square for the Super NES featured several changes from the original Japanese version. The most obvious of these is the change of the game&#x27;s title from &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; to &quot;Final Fantasy III&quot;; because only two games of the series had been localized in North America at the time, &quot;VI&quot; was distributed as &quot;Final Fantasy III&quot; to maintain naming continuity. Unlike &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot; (which was first released in North America as &quot;Final Fantasy II&quot;), there are no major changes to gameplay, though several changes of contents and editorial adjustments exist in the English script. In a January 1995 interview with &quot;Super Play&quot; magazine, translator Ted Woolsey explained that &quot;there&#x27;s a certain level of playfulness and ... sexuality in Japanese games that just doesn&#x27;t exist here [in the USA], basically because of Nintendo of America&#x27;s rules and guidelines&quot;. Consequently, objectionable graphics (e.g. nudity) were censored and building signs in towns were changed (such as Bar being changed to Café), as well as religious allusions (e.g. the spell &quot;Holy&quot; was renamed &quot;Pearl&quot;).

Also, some direct allusions to death, killing actions, and violent expressions, as well as offensive words have been replaced by softer expressions. For example, after Edgar, Locke and Terra flee on chocobos from Figaro Castle, Kefka orders two Magitek Armored soldiers to chase them by shouting &quot;Go! KILL THEM!&quot;, in the Japanese version. It was translated as &quot;Go! Get them!&quot; Also, when Imperial Troopers burn Figaro Castle, and Edgar claims Terra is not hidden inside the castle, Kefka replies &quot;then you can burn to death&quot; in the Japanese version, which was replaced in the English version by &quot;Then welcome to my barbecue!&quot;. Similarly, as Magitek soldiers watch Edgar and his guests escape on Chocobos, Kefka swears in Japanese, which was translated by Ted Woolsey as &quot;Son of a submariner!&quot;. The localization also featured changes to several names, such as &quot;Tina&quot; being changed to &quot;Terra&quot;. Finally, dialogue text files had to be shortened due to the limited data storage space available on the game cartridge&#x27;s read-only memory. As a result, additional changes were rendered to dialogue in order to compress it into the available space.

The PlayStation re-release featured only minor changes to the English localization. The title of the game was reverted to &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; from &quot;Final Fantasy III&quot;, to unify the numbering scheme of the series in North America and Japan with the earlier release of &quot;VII&quot;. A few item and character names were adjusted, as in the expansion of &quot;Fenix Down&quot; to &quot;Phoenix Down&quot;. Unlike the PlayStation re-release of &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot; included in the later &quot;Final Fantasy Chronicles&quot; compilation, the script was left essentially unchanged. The Game Boy Advance re-release featured a new translation by a different translator, Tom Slattery. This translation preserved most of the character names, location names, and terminology from the Woolsey translation, but changed item and spell names to match the conventions used in more recent titles in the series. The revised script preserved certain quirky lines from the original while changing or editing others, and it cleared up certain points of confusion in the original translation. The Wii Virtual Console release used the &quot;Final Fantasy III&quot; name of the Super NES game.

===Music===

The soundtrack for &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; was composed by long-time series contributor Nobuo Uematsu. The score consists of themes for each major character and location, as well as music for standard battles, fights with boss enemies and for special cutscenes. The extensive use of leitmotif is one of the defining points of the audio tracks. The &quot;Aria di Mezzo Carattere&quot; is one of the latter tracks, played during a cutscene involving an opera performance. This track features an unintelligible synthesized &quot;voice&quot; that harmonizes with the melody, as technical limitations for the SPC700 sound format chip prevented the use of an actual vocal track (although some developers eventually figured out how to overcome the limitation a few years later, and in the &quot;Pixel Remaster&quot;, it is voiced by opera singers). The orchestral album &quot;Final Fantasy VI Grand Finale&quot; features an arranged version of the aria, using Italian lyrics performed by Svetla Krasteva with an orchestral accompaniment. This version is also found in the ending full motion video of the game&#x27;s Sony PlayStation re-release, with the same lyrics but a different musical arrangement. In addition, the album &quot;Orchestral Game Concert 4&quot; includes an extended version of the opera arranged and conducted by Kōsuke Onozaki and performed by the Tokyo Symphony Orchestra, featuring Wakako Aokimi, Tetsuya Ōno, and Hiroshi Kuroda on vocals. It was also performed at the &quot;More Friends&quot; concert at the Gibson Amphitheatre in 2005 using a new English translation of the lyrics, an album of which is now available. &quot;Dancing Mad&quot;, accompanying the game&#x27;s final battle with Kefka, is 17 minutes long and contains an organ cadenza, with variations on Kefka&#x27;s theme. The &quot;Ending Theme&quot; combines every playable character theme into one composition lasting over 21 minutes.

The original score was released on three compact discs in Japan as &quot;Final Fantasy VI: Original Sound Version&quot;. A version of this album was later released in North America as &quot;Final Fantasy III: Kefka&#x27;s Domain&quot;. This version of the album is the same as its Japanese counterpart, except for different packaging and small differences in the translation of some track names between the album and newer releases. Additionally, &quot;Final Fantasy VI: Grand Finale&quot; features eleven tracks from the game, arranged by Shirō Sagisu and Tsuneyoshi Saito and performed by the Ensemble Archi Della Scala and Orchestra Sinfonica di Milano (Milan Symphony Orchestra). &quot;Piano Collections: Final Fantasy VI&quot;, a second arranged album, features thirteen tracks from the game, performed for piano by Reiko Nomura. More recently, &quot;Dancing Mad&quot;, the final boss theme from &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;, has been performed at Play! A Video Game Symphony in Stockholm, Sweden on June 2, 2007, by the group Machinae Supremacy.

Nobuo Uematsu&#x27;s former rock band, The Black Mages, released a progressive metal version of Dancing Mad on their eponymous first album in 2003. Their third album, subtitled &quot;Darkness and Starlight&quot;, is so named after its premiere track: a rock opera version of the entire opera from &quot;FFVI&quot;, including the Aria di Mezzo Carattere performed by Etsuyo Ota.

In 2012, a Kickstarter campaign for OverClocked ReMix was funded at $153,633 for the creation of a multiple CD album of remixes of the music from &quot;VI&quot;. Andrew Aversa directed the creation of the album, &quot;Balance and Ruin&quot;, which contains 74 tracks from 74 artists, each with its own unique style. The album is free and available at the OverClocked ReMix website. Video Games Live composer Jillian Aversa, Andrew Aversa&#x27;s wife, created a music video tribute to Aria di Mezzo Carattere, together with cellist Tina Guo, expanding on the arrangement from &quot;Balance and Ruin&quot;.

==Re-releases==
===PlayStation===
&quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; was ported to the PlayStation by Tose and re-released in Japan and North America in 1999. In Japan, it was available in both a standalone release and as part of &quot;Final Fantasy Collection&quot;, while in North America it was available only as part of &quot;Final Fantasy Anthology&quot;. In Europe it was sold only as a standalone release. Fifty thousand limited-edition copies were also released in Japan and included a &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;-themed alarm clock.

&quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;″s PlayStation port is very similar to the original Japanese Super Famicom release. With the exception of the addition of two full motion video opening and ending sequences and new screen-transition effects used for the start and end of battles, the graphics, music and sound are left unchanged from the original version. The only notable changes to gameplay (in addition to loading times not present in the cartridge versions) involve the correction of a few software bugs from the original and the addition of a new &quot;memo save&quot; feature, allowing players to quickly save their progress to the PlayStation&#x27;s RAM. The re-release included other special features, such as a bestiary and an artwork gallery. The port was re-released in December 2012 as part of the &quot;Final Fantasy 25th Anniversary Ultimate Box&quot; package in Japan.

&quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; was re-released as a PSone Classic in 2011: in Japan on April 20, in PAL territories on June 2 and in North America on December 6.

The &quot;Pixel Remaster&quot; series version of &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; was released for PlayStation 4 in April 2023.

===Nintendo consoles===
After the PlayStation, Tose then ported the game to the Game Boy Advance, on which it was released as &quot;Final Fantasy VI Advance&quot;. It was released in Japan by Square Enix on November 30, 2006, with Nintendo handling publishing in North America on February 5, 2007, and in Europe on July 6. It was the last game to be released on the Game Boy Advance in Asia, as well as the last one to be published by Nintendo on the system. It includes additional gameplay features, slightly improved visuals, and a new translation that follows Japanese naming conventions for the spells and monsters. It does not, however, have the full-motion videos from the PlayStation version of the game. Four new espers appear in &quot;Advance&quot;: Leviathan, Gilgamesh, Cactuar, and Diabolos. Two new areas include the Dragons&#x27; Den dungeon, which includes the Kaiser Dragon, a monster coded, but not included, in the original, and a &quot;Soul Shrine&quot;, a place where the player can fight monsters continuously. Three new spells also appear, and several bugs from the original are fixed. In addition, similarly to the other handheld &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; re-releases, a bestiary and a music player are included. Even in the Japanese version, the music player is in English and uses the American names, e.g. &quot;Strago&quot; over &quot;Stragus&quot;. The package features new artwork by series veteran and original character and image designer Yoshitaka Amano.

The original Super Famicom version was released for the Wii Virtual Console in Japan on March 15, 2011, in PAL territories (Europe and Australia) on March 18, and in North America on June 30. The game was released in the West with its original North American title of &quot;Final Fantasy III&quot;. The Super Famicom version was later released on the Wii U Virtual Console in Japan. Square Enix released the Game Boy Advance version on the Wii U Virtual Console in Japan in December 2015.

Nintendo re-released &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; worldwide in September 2017 as part of the company&#x27;s Super NES/Super Famicom Classic Edition.

The &quot;Pixel Remaster&quot; series version of &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; was released worldwide for Nintendo Switch in April 2023.

===Mobile platforms and PC===
Ports of &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; for Android and iOS mobile operating systems were also published in 2014, for Android on January 15, and for iOS on February 6, with features such as new high-resolution graphics with sprites designed by Kazuko Shibuya, who did the original game&#x27;s artwork, movement in eight directions, and auto-battle.

A Windows PC port, itself a port of the Android version, was released for Windows PC via Steam on December 16, 2015. Another port from the &quot;Pixel Remaster&quot; line was released on Steam on February 23, 2022. The &quot;Pixel Remaster&quot; series features new 16-bit sprites, new soundtracks, and a return to the game&#x27;s originally released content. No added content from any of the ported versions appears in any of the &quot;Pixel Remasters&quot;.

===Xbox Series X &amp; S ===
The &quot;Pixel Remaster series&quot; version of &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; was announced and launched for Xbox Series X/S in September 2024, marking the first release of the game alongside the other NES/SNES entries of the series on any Xbox consoles.

==Reception==
===Contemporary===
&quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; received critical acclaim and was commercially successful in Japan upon release. In mid-1994, Square&#x27;s publicity department reported that the game had sold copies in Japan, where it became the best-selling video game of 1994. In the United States, where it went on sale in the last quarter of 1994, it was the top-selling Super NES game in October and became the year&#x27;s eighth best-selling Super NES cartridge. Despite this, it was not a commercial success in that region, according to Sakaguchi. As of March 2003, the game had shipped 3.48 million copies worldwide, with 2.62 million of those copies being shipped in Japan and 860,000 abroad. &quot;Final Fantasy Collection&quot; sold over 400,000 copies in 1999, making it the 31st-best-selling release of that year in Japan. &quot;Final Fantasy Anthology&quot; has sold approximately 364,000 copies in North America. &quot;Final Fantasy VI Advance&quot; sold over 223,000 copies in Japan by the end of 2006, one month after release.

&quot;GamePro&quot; rated it 4.5 out of 5 in graphics and a perfect 5.0 in sound, control, and fun factor, stating that &quot;characters, plotlines, and multiple-choice scenarios all combine to form one fantastic game!&quot; The four reviewers of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; each granted it a unanimous score of 9 out of 10 (36 out of 40) and their &quot;Game of the Month&quot; award, commenting that it had set the new standard for excellence in RPGs. They particularly praised the graphics, music, and the strong emotional involvement of the story. It won several awards from &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; in their 1994 video game awards, including Best Role-Playing Game, Best Japanese Role-Playing Game, and Best Music for a Cartridge-Based Game. Additionally, they ranked the game ninth in their 1997 list of the 100 greatest console games of all time. &quot;Famitsu&quot; scored it 37 out of 40, making it one of their two highest-rated games of 1994 (along with &quot;Ridge Racer&quot;). For their part, &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; declared the game &quot;the RPG hit of the decade&quot;, noting its improved sound and graphics over its predecessors, and the game&#x27;s broadened thematic scope. Moreover, they suggested that &quot;with so much story and variation of play ... fans may become lost in the world for months at a time&quot;. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; also opined that the game plot was &quot;not particularly inventive&quot; and the &quot;story is often sappy–not written for an American audience&quot;.

In 1997, &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; ranked it as the eighth greatest Nintendo game, saying it &quot;had everything you could want—heroes, world-shattering events, magic, mindless evil—plus Interceptor the wonder dog!&quot; The same year, &quot;GamePro&quot; said it &quot;still remains one of the most fun, innovative, and challenging RPGs to date&quot;. In 1996, &quot;Next Generation&quot; said the scene in which Terra cares for a village of orphaned children &quot;can perhaps be safely named as the series&#x27; finest hour... no other game series has tackled such big issues, or reached such a level of emotional depth and complexity&quot;.

===Retrospective===
&quot;Final Fantasy Collection&quot; received 54 out of 60 points from &quot;Weekly Famitsu&quot;, scored by a panel of six reviewers. &quot;IGN&quot; described the graphics of the PlayStation re-release as &quot;beautiful and stunning&quot;, reflecting that, at the time of its release, &quot;&quot;Final Fantasy III&quot;... represented everything an RPG should be&quot;, inspiring statistic growth systems that would later influence titles like &quot;Wild Arms&quot; and &quot;Suikoden&quot;. Moreover, they praised its gameplay and storyline, claiming that these aspects took &quot;all... preceding RPG concepts and either came up with something completely new or refined them enough to make them its own&quot;, creating an atmosphere in which &quot;[players] won&#x27;t find it difficult to get past the simplistic graphics or seemingly out-dated gameplay conventions and become involved&quot;. RPGamer gave a perfect rating to both the original game and its PlayStation re-release, citing its gameplay as &quot;self-explanatory enough that most any player could pick up the game and customize their characters&#x27; equipment&quot;, while praising its music as &quot;a 16-bit masterpiece&quot;. Joe Juba of &quot;Game Informer&quot; called the split between the World of Balance and World of Ruin one of the game&#x27;s distinguishing features, citing its non-linear, freeform nature, a contrast to the standard linear gameplay of the first half. Calling it a &quot;pioneering approach&quot; to wander the land reassembling your former team, he noted that it made the narrative &quot;largely player-driven&quot;, calling it part of the basic structure that would later be used by open world games.

The game&#x27;s release for the Game Boy Advance also garnered praise. the Game Boy Advance re-release was named eighth best Game Boy Advance game of all time in IGN&#x27;s feature reflecting on the Game Boy Advance&#x27;s long lifespan. &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot; ranked the GBA version of the game 32nd on a list of greatest Nintendo games in 2009. &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; is often regarded as one of the best titles in the series and one of the best role-playing video games ever created according to multiple websites. Readers of the Japanese magazine &quot;Famitsu&quot; voted it as the 25th best game of all time. In an updated version of the &quot;Top 100&quot; list in 2007, &quot;IGN&quot; ranked &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; as the ninth top game of all time, above all other &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games in the series. They continued to cite the game&#x27;s character development, and especially noted Kefka as one of the most memorable villains in RPG history. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; listed the ending to &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; as one of the best finales, citing the narrative and cast variety. Time Extension included the game on their &quot;Best JRPGs of All Time&quot; list.

==Legacy==

Following &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;, Square began testing for its next entry &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; on the Nintendo 64, but technical issues, escalating cartridge costs and the higher storage capacity of CD technology persuaded Square to move &quot;VII&quot; and all their subsequent titles onto the PlayStation. During early testing on 3D development software, the team rendered a battle involving &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; characters Terra, Locke and Shadow. The decision to move to PlayStation soured the relations between Square and Nintendo. Due to this, &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; was the last series title to release on a Nintendo platform until &quot;Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles&quot; came out on the Nintendo GameCube in 2003. It was also the last new mainline &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; game to come to a Nintendo platform until 2018 when the abridged &quot;Final Fantasy XV: Pocket Edition&quot; was released on Nintendo Switch, followed by the subsequent rereleases of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, &quot;VIII&quot;, &quot;IX&quot;, &quot;X&quot;, &quot;X-2&quot; and &quot;XII&quot; the following year. &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; was included in the Super NES Classic Edition under its original titling as &quot;Final Fantasy III&quot; for the North American and European release in September 2017.

In 2010, Square Enix producer Shinji Hashimoto said that the development of a remake of &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; for the Nintendo DS was &quot;undecided&quot; due to &quot;technical issues&quot;. Later, however, Square discussed remaking &quot;VI&quot; as well as &quot;V&quot; for the Nintendo 3DS. Tetsuya Nomura, then directing &quot;Final Fantasy VII Remake&quot;, expressed interest in remaking &quot;V&quot; and &quot;VI&quot;.

&quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; has made multiple appearances in the &quot;Final Fantasy Trading Card Game&quot;.

<doc id="52756" wikidata="Q214232" url="?curid=52756" title="Final Fantasy VII">
<text>is a 1997 role-playing video game developed by Square for the PlayStation. The seventh main installment in the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series, it was released in Japan by Square and internationally by Sony Computer Entertainment, becoming the first game in the main series to have a PAL release. The game&#x27;s story follows Cloud Strife, a mercenary who joins an eco-terrorist organization to stop a world-controlling megacorporation from using the planet&#x27;s life essence as an energy source. Ensuing events send Cloud and his allies in pursuit of Sephiroth, a superhuman who seeks to wound the planet and harness its healing power in order to be reborn as a god. Throughout their journey, Cloud bonds with his party members, including Aerith Gainsborough, who holds the secret to saving their world.

Development began in 1994, originally for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. After delays and technical difficulties from experimenting with several platforms, most notably the Nintendo 64, Square moved production to the PlayStation, largely due to the advantages of the format. Veteran &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; staff returned, including series creator and producer Hironobu Sakaguchi, director Yoshinori Kitase, and composer Nobuo Uematsu. The title was the first in the series to use full motion video and 3D computer graphics, featuring 3D character models superimposed over 2D pre-rendered backgrounds. Although the gameplay remained mostly unchanged from previous entries, &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; introduced more widespread science fiction elements and a more realistic presentation. The combined development and marketing budget amounted to approximately 80 million.

&quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; received widespread commercial and critical success. It remains widely regarded as a landmark title and one of the greatest and most influential video games ever made. The title won numerous Game of the Year awards and was acknowledged for boosting the sales of the PlayStation and popularizing Japanese role-playing games worldwide. Critics praised its graphics, gameplay, music, and story, although some criticism was directed towards the original English localization. Its success has led to enhanced ports on various platforms, a multimedia subseries called the &quot;Compilation of Final Fantasy VII&quot;, and a high definition remake trilogy currently comprising &quot;Final Fantasy VII Remake&quot; (2020), and &quot;Final Fantasy VII Rebirth&quot; (2024).

==Gameplay==

The gameplay of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; is similar to earlier &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; titles and Japanese role-playing games. The game features three modes of play: the world map, the field, and the battle screen. At its grandest scale, players explore the world of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; on a 3D world map. The world map contains representations of areas for the player to enter, including towns, environments, and ruins. Natural barriers—such as mountains, deserts, and bodies of water—block access by foot to some areas; as the story progresses, the player receives vehicles that help traverse these obstacles, thus opening more of the game world for exploration. Chocobos can be found in certain spots on the map and, if caught, can be ridden to areas inaccessible on foot or by vehicle. In field mode, the player navigates fully scaled versions of the areas represented on the world map. &quot;VII&quot; marks the first time in the series that the mode is represented in a three-dimensional space. In this mode, the player can explore the environment, talk with characters, advance the story, and initiate event games. Event games are short minigames that use special control functions and are often tied to the story. While in field mode, the player can also make use of shops and inns. Shops allow the player to buy and sell items that can aid Cloud and his party, such as weapons, armor, and accessories. Inns restore the hit points and mana points of characters who rest at them and cure abnormalities contracted during battles.
At random intervals on the world map and in field mode, and at specific moments in the story, the game will enter the battle screen, which places the player characters on one side and the enemies on the other. It employs an Active Time Battle (ATB) system, in which the characters exchange moves until one side is defeated. The damage or healing dealt by either side is quantified on screen. Characters have several statistics that determine their effectiveness in battle; for example, hit points determine how much damage they can take, and magic determines how much damage they can inflict with spells. Each character on the screen has a time gauge; when a character&#x27;s gauge is full, the player can input a command for them to perform. The commands change as the game progresses, and are dependent on the characters in the player&#x27;s party and on the abilities, spells, etc., the player has added to their equipment. Commands include attacking with a weapon, casting magic, using items, summoning monsters, and other actions that either damage the enemy or aid the player characters. &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; also features powerful, character-specific commands called Limit Breaks, which can be used only after a special gauge is charged by taking enemy attacks. After being attacked, characters can be afflicted by one or more abnormal &quot;statuses&quot;, such as poison or paralysis. These statuses and their adverse effects can be removed by special items or abilities or by resting at an inn. Once all enemies are defeated, the battle ends, and the player is rewarded with money, items, and experience points. If the player is defeated, it is game over and the game must be loaded from the last save point.

When not in battle, the player can use the menu screen, where they can review each character&#x27;s status and statistics, use items and abilities, change equipment, save the game when on the world map or at a save point, and manage orbs called Materia. Materia are the main method of customizing characters in &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, and can be added to equipment to provide characters with new magic spells, monsters to summon, commands, statistical upgrades, and other benefits. Materia level up through their own experience point system and can be combined to create different effects.

==Synopsis==
===Setting and characters===

&quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; takes place on a world referred to in-game as the &quot;Planet&quot; and retroactively named &quot;Gaia&quot;. The planet&#x27;s lifeforce, called the Lifestream, is a flow of spiritual energy that gives life to everything on the Planet; its processed form is known as &quot;Mako&quot;. On a societal and technological level, the game has been defined as an industrial or post-industrial science fiction setting. During &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, the Shinra Electric Power Company, a world-dominating megacorporation headquartered in the city of Midgar, is draining the Planet&#x27;s Lifestream for energy, weakening the Planet and threatening its existence and all life. Significant factions within the game include AVALANCHE, an eco-terrorist group seeking Shinra&#x27;s downfall so the Planet can recover; the Turks, a covert branch of Shinra&#x27;s security forces; SOLDIER, an elite Shinra fighting force created by enhancing humans with Mako; and the Cetra, a near-extinct human tribe which maintains a strong connection to the Planet and the Lifestream.

The main protagonist is Cloud Strife, an aloof mercenary who claims to be a former 1st Class SOLDIER. Early on, he works with two members of AVALANCHE: Barret Wallace, its brazen but fatherly leader; and Tifa Lockhart, a shy yet nurturing martial artist and his childhood friend. During their journey, they meet Aerith Gainsborough, a carefree flower merchant and one of the last surviving Cetra; Red XIII, an intelligent canine from a tribe that protects the planet; Cait Sith, a fortune-telling robotic cat controlled by repentant Shinra staff member Reeve; and Cid Highwind, a pilot whose dream of being the first human in outer space was unrealized. The group can also recruit Yuffie Kisaragi, a young ninja and skilled Materia thief; and Vincent Valentine, a former Turk and victim of Shinra&#x27;s experiments. The game&#x27;s main antagonists are Rufus Shinra, the son of President Shinra and the later leader of the Shinra Corporation; Sephiroth, a former SOLDIER who reappears several years after being presumed dead; and Jenova, a hostile extraterrestrial life-form who the Cetra imprisoned 2,000 years ago and who Sephiroth was created from. A key character in Cloud&#x27;s backstory is Zack Fair, a member of SOLDIER and Aerith&#x27;s first love.

===Plot===
AVALANCHE destroys a Shinra Mako reactor in Midgar, but an attack on another reactor goes wrong and Cloud falls into the city&#x27;s slums. There, he meets Aerith and protects her from Shinra. Meanwhile, Shinra finds AVALANCHE&#x27;s base of operations and intentionally collapses part of the upper city level in retaliation for the Mako reactor being destroyed, killing many AVALANCHE members and innocent bystanders as collateral damage. Aerith is also captured since Shinra believes that as a Cetra, she can potentially reveal the &quot;Promised Land&quot;, which they believe is overflowing with Lifestream energy they can exploit. Cloud, Barret, and Tifa rescue Aerith, and during their escape from Midgar, discover that Sephiroth murdered President Shinra despite being presumed dead five years earlier. The party pursues Sephiroth across the Planet, with now-President Rufus on their trail; they are soon joined by the rest of the playable characters.

At a Cetra temple, Sephiroth reveals he intends to use a powerful magical artifact known as &quot;Black Materia&quot; to cast the spell &quot;Meteor&quot;, which would have a devastating impact on the Planet. Sephiroth claims he will absorb the Lifestream as it attempts to heal the wound caused by Meteor, and become a god-like being in the process. The party retrieves the Black Materia, but Sephiroth manipulates Cloud into surrendering it. Aerith departs alone to stop Sephiroth and follows him to an abandoned Cetra city. While Aerith prays to the Planet for help, Sephiroth attempts to force Cloud to kill her; after this fails, he kills her himself before fleeing, leaving the White Materia behind. The party then learns of Jenova, a hostile alien lifeform who landed on the Planet two thousand years prior to the game&#x27;s events. Upon arrival on the Planet, Jenova began infecting the Cetra with a virus, and they were nearly wiped out. However, a small group managed to seal away Jenova in a tomb, which Shinra later unearthed. At Nibelheim, Jenova&#x27;s cells were used in experiments which led to the creation of Sephiroth. Five years before the game&#x27;s events, Sephiroth and Cloud visited Nibelheim, where Sephiroth learned of his origins and was driven insane as a result. He murdered the townspeople, and then vanished after Cloud confronted him.

At the Northern Crater, the party learns that the &quot;Sephiroths&quot; they have encountered are Jenova clones who the insane Shinra scientist Hojo created. Cloud confronts the real Sephiroth as he is killing his clones to reunite Jenova&#x27;s cells, but is again manipulated into giving him the Black Materia. Sephiroth then taunts Cloud by showing another SOLDIER in his place in his memories of Nibelheim, suggesting that Cloud is a failed clone of Sephiroth. Sephiroth summons Meteor and seals the Crater as Cloud falls into the Lifestream and Rufus captures the party.

After escaping Shinra, the party discovers Cloud at an island hospital in a catatonic state from Mako poisoning, and Tifa decides to stay as his caretaker. When a planetary defense force called Weapon attacks the island, the two fall into the Lifestream, where Tifa helps Cloud reconstruct his memories. Cloud was a mere infantryman who was never accepted into SOLDIER; the SOLDIER in his memories was his friend Zack. At Nibelheim, Cloud ambushed and wounded Sephiroth after the latter&#x27;s mental breakdown, but Jenova preserved Sephiroth&#x27;s life. Hojo experimented on Cloud and Zack for four years, injecting them with Jenova&#x27;s cells and Mako. They managed to escape, but Zack was killed in the process. The trauma of these events triggered an identity crisis in Cloud, and he constructed a false persona based around Zack&#x27;s stories and his own fantasies. Cloud accepts his past and reunites with the party, who learn that Aerith&#x27;s prayer to the Planet had been successful: the Planet had attempted to summon Holy to prevent Meteor&#x27;s impact, but Sephiroth prevented it from having any effect.

Shinra fails to destroy Meteor, but manages to defeat a Weapon and puncture the Northern Crater, seemingly killing Rufus and several other personnel. After killing Hojo, who is revealed to be Sephiroth&#x27;s biological father, the party descends to the Planet&#x27;s core through the opening in the Northern Crater and defeats both Jenova and Sephiroth. The party escapes and Holy is summoned once again, destroying Meteor with help from the Lifestream. Five hundred years later, Red XIII is seen with two cubs looking out over the ruins of Midgar, which are now covered in greenery, showing that the planet has healed.

==Development==

Initial concept talks for &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; began in 1994 at Square studio, following the completion of &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;. As with the previous installment, series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi reduced his role to producer and granted others a more active role in development: these included Yoshinori Kitase, one of the directors of &quot;FFVI&quot;. The next installment was planned as a 2D game for Nintendo&#x27;s Super Nintendo Entertainment System (Super NES). After creating an early 2D prototype of it, the team postponed development to help finish &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;. Once &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; was completed, the team resumed discussions for &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; in 1995.

The team discussed continuing the 2D strategy, which would have been the safe and immediate path just prior to the imminent industry shift toward 3D gaming; such a change would require radical new development models. The team decided to take the riskier option and make a 3D game on new generation hardware but had yet to choose between the cartridge-based Nintendo 64 or the CD-ROM-based PlayStation from Sony Computer Entertainment. The team also considered the Sega Saturn console and Microsoft Windows. Their decision was influenced by two factors: a highly successful tech demo based on &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; using the new Softimage 3D software, and the escalating price of cartridge-based games, which was limiting Square&#x27;s audience. Tests were made for a Nintendo 64 version, which would use the planned 64DD peripheral despite the lack of 64DD development kits and the prototype device&#x27;s changing hardware specifications. This version was discarded during early testing, as the 2000 polygons needed to render the Behemoth monster placed excessive strain on the Nintendo 64 hardware, causing a low frame rate. It would have required an estimated thirty 64DD discs to run &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; properly with the data compression methods of the day. Faced with both technical and economic issues on Nintendo&#x27;s current hardware, and impressed by the increased storage capacity of CD-ROM when compared to the Nintendo 64 cartridge, Square shifted development of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, and all other planned projects, onto the PlayStation. 

The &quot;Final Fantasy 7&quot; staff at one point were planning to use a first person camera for world map exploration with enemies visible on the world map terrain and also wanted up to 10 characters to be in your party at once in the battle scenes. In the final version, the overall gameplay system remained mostly unchanged from &quot;Final Fantasy V&quot; and &quot;VI&quot;, but with an emphasis on player control. The initial decision was for battles to feature shifting camera angles. Battle arenas had a lower polygon count than field areas, which made creating distinctive features more difficult. The summon sequences benefited strongly from the switch to the cinematic style, as the team had struggled to portray their scale using 2D graphics. In his role as producer, Sakaguchi placed much of his effort into developing the battle system. He proposed the Materia system as a way to provide more character customization than previous &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games: battles no longer revolved around characters with innate skills and roles in battle, as Materia could be reconfigured between battles. Artist Tetsuya Nomura also contributed to the gameplay; he designed the Limit Break system as an evolution of the Desperation Attacks used in &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;. The Limit Breaks served a purpose in gameplay while also evoking each character&#x27;s personality in battle.

Square retained the passion-based game development approach from their earlier projects, but now had the resources and ambition to create the game they wanted. This was because they had extensive capital from their earlier commercial successes, which meant they could focus on quality and scale rather than obsessing over and working around their budget. &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; was at the time one of the most expensive video game projects ever, costing an estimated 40 million, which adjusted for inflation came to $61 million in 2017. Development of the final version took a staff of between 100 and 150 people just over a year to complete. As video game development teams were usually only 20 people, the game had what was described as the largest development team of any game up to that point. The development team was split between both Square&#x27;s Japanese offices and its new American office in Los Angeles; the American team worked primarily on city backgrounds.

===Art design===

The game&#x27;s art director was Yusuke Naora, who had previously worked as a designer for &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;. With the switch into 3D, Naora realized that he needed to relearn drawing, as 3D visuals require a very different approach than 2D. With the massive scale and scope of the project, Naora was granted a team devoted entirely to the game&#x27;s visual design. The department&#x27;s duties included illustration, modeling of 3D characters, texturing, the creation of environments, visual effects, and animation. The Shinra logo, which incorporated a kanji symbol, was drawn by Naora personally. Promotional artwork, in addition to the logo artwork, was created by Yoshitaka Amano, an artist whose association with the series went back to its inception. While he had taken a prominent role in earlier entries, Amano was unable to do so for &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, due to commitments at overseas exhibitions. His logo artwork was based on Meteor: when he saw images of Meteor, he was not sure how to turn it into suitable artwork. In the end, he created multiple variations of the image and asked staff to choose which they preferred. The green coloring represents the predominant lighting in Midgar and the color of the Lifestream, while the blue reflected the ecological themes present in the story. Its coloring directly influenced the general coloring of the game&#x27;s environments.

Another prominent artist was Nomura. Having impressed Sakaguchi with his proposed ideas, which were handwritten and illustrated rather than simply typed on a PC, Nomura was brought on as main character designer. Nomura stated that when he was brought on, the main scenario had not been completed, but he &quot;went along like, &#x27;I guess first off you need a hero and a heroine&#x27;, and from there drew the designs while thinking up details about the characters. After [he&#x27;d] done the hero and heroine, [he] carried on drawing by thinking what kind of characters would be interesting to have. When [he] handed over the designs [he&#x27;d] tell people the character details [he&#x27;d] thought up, or write them down on a separate sheet of paper&quot;. Something that could not be carried over from earlier titles was the chibi sprite art, as that would not fit with the new graphical direction. Naora, in his role as an assistant character designer and art director, helped adjust each character&#x27;s appearance so the actions they performed were believable. When designing Cloud and Sephiroth, Nomura was influenced by his view of their rivalry mirroring the legendary animosity between Miyamoto Musashi and Sasaki Kojirō, with Cloud and Sephiroth being Musashi and Kojirō respectively. Sephiroth&#x27;s look was defined as &quot;kakkoii&quot;, a Japanese term combining good looks with coolness. Several of Nomura&#x27;s designs evolved substantially during development. Cloud&#x27;s original design of slicked-back black hair with no spikes was intended to save polygons and contrast with Sephiroth&#x27;s long, flowing silver hair. However, Nomura feared that such masculinity could prove unpopular with fans, so he redesigned Cloud to feature a shock of spiky, bright blond hair. Vincent&#x27;s occupation changed from researcher to detective to chemist, and finally to a former Turk with a tragic past.

===Scenario===
Sakaguchi was responsible for writing the initial plot, which was quite different from the final version. In this draft for the planned SNES version, the game&#x27;s setting was envisioned as New York City in 1999. Similar to the final story, the main characters were part of an organization trying to destroy Mako reactors, but they were pursued by a hot-blooded detective named Joe. The main characters would eventually blow up the city. An early version of the Lifestream concept was present at this stage. According to Sakaguchi, his mother had died while &quot;Final Fantasy III&quot; was being developed, and choosing life as a theme helped him cope with her passing in a rational and analytical manner. Square eventually used the New York setting in &quot;Parasite Eve&quot; (1998). While the planned concept was dropped, &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; still marked a drastic shift in setting from previous entries, dropping the Medieval fantasy elements in favor of a world that was &quot;ambiguously futuristic&quot;.
When Kitase was put in charge of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, he and Nomura reworked the entire initial plot. Scenario writer Kazushige Nojima joined the team after finishing work on &quot;Bahamut Lagoon&quot;. While &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; featured an ensemble cast of numerous playable characters that were equally important, the team soon decided to develop a central protagonist for &quot;FFVII&quot;. The pursuit of Sephiroth that formed most of the main narrative was suggested by Nomura, as nothing similar had been done in the series before. Kitase and Nojima conceived AVALANCHE and Shinra as opposing organizations and created Cloud&#x27;s backstory as well as his relationship to Sephiroth. Among Nojima&#x27;s biggest contributions to the plot were Cloud&#x27;s memories and split personality; this included the eventual conclusion involving his newly created character of Zack. The crew helped Kitase adjust the specifics of Sakaguchi&#x27;s original Lifestream concept.

Regarding the overall theme of the game, Sakaguchi said it was &quot;not enough to make &#x27;life&#x27; the theme, you need to depict living and dying. In any event, you need to portray death&quot;. Consequently, Nomura proposed killing off the heroine. Aerith had been the only heroine, but the death of a female protagonist would necessitate a second; this led to the creation of Tifa. The developers decided to kill Aerith, as her death would be the most devastating and consequential. Kitase wanted to depict it as very sudden and unexpected, leaving &quot;not a dramatic feeling but great emptiness&quot;, &quot;feelings of reality and not Hollywood&quot;. The script for the scene was written by Nojima. Kitase and Nojima then planned that most of the main cast would die shortly before the final battle; Nomura vetoed the idea because he felt it would undermine the impact of Aerith&#x27;s death. Several character relations and statuses underwent changes during development. Aerith was to be Sephiroth&#x27;s sister, which influenced the design of her hair. The team then made Sephiroth a previous love interest of hers to deepen her backstory, but later swapped him with Zack. Vincent and Yuffie were to be part of the main narrative, but due to time constraints, they were nearly cut and eventually relegated to being optional characters.

Nojima was charged with writing the scenario and unifying the team&#x27;s ideas into a cohesive narrative, as Kitase was impressed with his earlier work on the mystery-like &quot;Heracles no Eikō III: Kamigami no Chinmoku&quot;, an entry in the &quot;Glory of Heracles&quot; series. To make the characters more realistic, Nojima wrote scenes in which they would occasionally argue and raise objections: while this inevitably slowed down the pace of the story, it added depth to the characters. The graphical improvements allowed even relatively bland lines of dialogue to be enhanced with reactions and poses from the 3D character models. Voice acting would have led to significant load times, so it was omitted. Masato Kato wrote several late-game scenes, including the Lifestream sequence and Cloud and Tifa&#x27;s conversation before the final battle. Initially unaffiliated with the project, Kato was called on to help flesh out less important story scenes. He wrote his scenes to his own tastes without outside consultation, something he later regretted.

===Graphics===
With the shift from the SNES to the next generation consoles, &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; became the first project in the series to use 3D computer graphics. Aside from the story, &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; had many details undecided when development began; most design elements were hashed out along the way. In contrast, with &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, the developers knew from the outset it was going to be &quot;a real 3D game&quot;, so from the earliest planning stage, detailed designs were in existence. The script was also finalized, and the image for the graphics had been fleshed out. This meant that when actual development work began, storyboards for the game were already in place. The shift from cartridge ROM to CD-ROM posed some problems: according to lead programmer Ken Narita, the CD-ROM had a slower access speed, delaying some actions during the game, so the team needed to overcome this issue. Certain tricks were used to conceal load times, such as offering animations to keep players from getting bored. When it was decided to use 3D graphics, there was a discussion among the staff whether to use sprite-based characters on 3D backgrounds or fully rendered polygonal models. While sprites proved more popular with the staff, the polygon models were chosen as they could better express emotion. This decision was influenced by the team&#x27;s exposure to the 3D character models used in &quot;Alone in the Dark&quot;. Sakaguchi decided to use deformed models for field navigation and real-time event scenes, for better expression of emotion, while realistically proportioned models would be used in battles. The team purchased Silicon Graphics Onyx supercomputers and related workstations, and accompanying software including Softimage 3D, PowerAnimator, and N-World for an estimated total of $21 million. Many team members had never seen the technology before.
The transition from 2D graphics to 3D environments overlaid on pre-rendered backgrounds was accompanied by a focus on a more realistic presentation. In previous entries, the sizes for characters and environments were fixed, and the player saw things from a scrolling perspective. This changed with &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;; environments shifted with camera angles, and character model sizes shifted depending on both their place in the environment and their distance from the camera, giving a sense of scale. The choice of this highly cinematic style of storytelling, contrasting directly with Square&#x27;s previous games, was attributed to Kitase, who was a fan of films and had an interest in the parallels between film and video game narrative. Character movement during in-game events was done by the character designers in the planning group. While designers normally cooperate with a motion specialist for such animations, the designers taught themselves motion work, resulting in each character&#x27;s movements differing depending on their creators—some designers liked exaggerated movements, while others went for subtlety. Much of the time was spent on each character&#x27;s day-to-day, routine animations. Motion specialists were brought in for the game&#x27;s battle animations. The first characters the team worked with were Cloud and Barret. Some of the real-time effects, such as an explosion near the opening, were hand-drawn rather than computer-animated.

The main creative force behind the overall 3D presentation was Kazuyuki Hashimoto, the general supervisor for these sequences. Being experienced in the new technology the team had brought on board, he accepted the post at Square as the team aligned with his own creative spirit. One of the major events in development was when the real-time graphics were synchronized to computer-generated full motion video (FMV) cutscenes for some story sequences, notably an early sequence where a real-time model of Cloud jumps onto an FMV-rendered moving train. The backgrounds were created by overlaying two 2D graphic layers and changing the motion speed of each to simulate depth perception. While this was not a new technique, the increased power of the PlayStation enabled a more elaborate version of this effect. The biggest issue with the 3D graphics was the large memory storage gap between the development hardware and the console: while the early 3D tech demo had been developed on a machine with over 400 megabytes of total memory, the PlayStation only had two megabytes of system memory and 500 kilobytes for texture memory. The team needed to figure out how to shrink the amount of data while preserving the desired effects. This was aided with reluctant help from Sony, who had hoped to keep Square&#x27;s direct involvement limited to a standard API package, but they eventually relented and allowed the team direct access to the hardware specifications.

&quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; features two types of cutscenes: real-time cutscenes featuring polygon models on pre-rendered backgrounds, and FMV cutscenes. The game&#x27;s computer-generated imagery (CGI) FMVs were produced by Visual Works, a then-new subsidiary of Square that specialized in computer graphics and FMVs creation. Visual Works had created the initial movie concept for a 3D game project. The FMVs were created by an international team, covering both Japan and North America and involving talent from the gaming and film industry; Western contributors included artists and staff who had worked on the &quot;Star Wars&quot; film series, &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;, and &quot;True Lies&quot;. The team tried to create additional optional CGI content which would bring optional characters Vincent and Yuffie into the ending. As this would have further increased the number of discs the game needed, the idea was discarded. Kazuyuki Ikumori, a future key figure at Visual Works, helped with the creation of the CGI cutscenes, in addition to general background design. The CGI FMV sequences total around 40 minutes of footage, something only possible with the PlayStation&#x27;s extra memory space and graphical power. This innovation brought with it the added difficulty of ensuring that the inferiority of the in-game graphics in comparison to the FMV sequences was not too obvious. Kitase has described the process of making the in-game environments as detailed as possible to be &quot;a daunting task&quot;.

===Music===

The musical score of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; was composed, arranged, and produced by Nobuo Uematsu, who had served as the sole composer for the six previous &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games. Originally, Uematsu had planned to use CD quality music with vocal performances to take advantage of the console&#x27;s audio capabilities but found that it resulted in the game having much longer loading times for each area. Uematsu then decided that the higher-quality audio was not worth the trade-off with performance, and opted instead to use MIDI-like sounds produced by the console&#x27;s internal sound sequencer, similar to how his soundtracks for the previous games in the series on the Super NES were implemented. While the Super NES only had eight sound channels to work with, the PlayStation had twenty-four. Eight were reserved for sound effects, leaving sixteen available for the music. Uematsu&#x27;s approach to composing the game&#x27;s music was to treat it like a film soundtrack and compose music that reflected the mood of the scenes, rather than trying to make strong melodies to &quot;define the game&quot;, as he felt that approach would come across too strong when placed alongside the game&#x27;s new 3D visuals. As an example, he composed the track intended for the scene in the game where Aerith Gainsborough is killed to be &quot;sad but beautiful&quot;, rather than more overtly emotional, creating what he felt was a more understated feeling. Uematsu additionally said that the soundtrack had a feel of &quot;realism&quot;, which also prevented him from using &quot;exorbitant, crazy music&quot;.

The first piece that Uematsu composed for the game was the opening theme; game director Yoshinori Kitase showed him the opening cinematic and asked him to begin the project there. The track was well received in the company, which gave Uematsu &quot;a sense that it was going to be a really good project&quot;. &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; was the first game in the series to include a track with high-quality digitized vocals, &quot;One-Winged Angel&quot;, which accompanies a section of the final battle of the game. The track has been called Uematsu&#x27;s &quot;most recognizable contribution&quot; to the music of the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series, which Uematsu agrees with. Inspired by &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot; by Igor Stravinsky to make a more &quot;classical&quot; track, and by rock and roll music from the late 1960s and early 1970s to make an orchestral track with a &quot;destructive impact&quot;, he spent two weeks composing short unconnected musical phrases, and then arranged them together into &quot;One-Winged Angel&quot;, an approach he had never used before.

Music from the game has been released in several albums. Square released the main soundtrack album, &quot;Final Fantasy VII Original Soundtrack&quot;, on four Compact Discs through its DigiCube subsidiary in 1997. A limited edition release was also produced, containing illustrated liner notes. The regular edition of the album reached third on the Japan Oricon charts, while the limited edition reached #19. Overall, the album had sold nearly 150,000 copies by January 2010. A single-disc album of selected tracks from the original soundtrack, along with three arranged pieces, titled &quot;Final Fantasy VII Reunion Tracks&quot;, was also released by DigiCube in 1997, reaching #20 on the Japan Oricon charts. A third album, &quot;Piano Collections Final Fantasy VII&quot;, was released by DigiCube in 2003, and contains one disc of piano arrangements of tracks from the game. It was arranged by Shirō Hamaguchi and performed by Seiji Honda, and reached #228 on the Oricon charts.

==Release==
&quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; was announced in February 1996. Square president and chief executive officer Tomoyuki Takechi were fairly confident about Japanese players making the game a commercial success despite it being on a new platform. A playable demo was included on a disc giveaway at the 1996 Tokyo Game Show, dubbed &quot;Square&#x27;s Preview Extra: Final Fantasy VII &amp; Siggraph &#x27;95 Works&quot;. The disc also included the early test footage Square created using characters from &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;. The initial release date was at some point in 1996, but to properly realize their vision, Square postponed the release date almost a full year. &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; was released on January 31, 1997. It was published in Japan by Square. A re-release of the game based on its Western version, titled &quot;Final Fantasy VII International&quot;, was released on October 2 the same year. This improved &quot;International&quot; version would kickstart the trend for Square to create an updated version for the Japanese release, based on the enhanced Western versions. The &quot;International&quot; version was re-released as a physical disc as part of the &quot;Final Fantasy 25th Anniversary Ultimate Box&quot; Japanese package on December 18, 2012.

While its success in Japan had been taken for granted by Square executives, North America and Europe were another matter, as up to that time the Japanese role-playing genre was still a niche market in Western territories. Sony, due to the PlayStation&#x27;s struggles against Nintendo and Sega&#x27;s home consoles, lobbied for the publishing rights in North America and Europe following &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;″s transfer to PlayStation—to further persuade Square, Sony offered a lucrative royalties deal with profits potentially equaling those Square would get by self-publishing the game. Square accepted Sony&#x27;s offer as Square itself lacked Western publishing experience. Square was uncertain about the game&#x27;s success, as other JRPGs including &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; had met with poor sales outside Japan. To help with promoting the title overseas, Square dissolved their original Washington offices and hired new staff for fresh offices in Costa Mesa. It was first exhibited to the Western public at Electronic Entertainment Expo 1996 (E3).

To promote the game overseas, Square and Sony launched a widespread three-month advertising campaign in August 1997. Beginning with a television commercial that ran alongside popular shows such as &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and &quot;The Simpsons&quot; by TBWA\Chiat\Day, the campaign included numerous articles in both gaming and general interest magazines, advertisements in comics from publishers such as DC Comics and Marvel Comics, a special collaboration with Pepsi, media events, sample discs, and merchandise. According to estimations by Takechi, the total worldwide marketing budget came to 40 million; $10 million had been spent in Japan, $10 million in Europe, and $20 million in North America. Unlike its predecessors, &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; did not have its numeral adjusted to account for the lack of a Western release for &quot;Final Fantasy II&quot;, &quot;III&quot;, and &quot;V&quot; — while only the fourth &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; released outside Japan, its Japanese title was retained. It was released in North America on September 7, 1997. The game was released in Europe on November 17, becoming the first &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; game to be released in Europe. The Western version included additional elements and alterations, such as streamlining of the menu and Materia system, reducing the health of enemies, new visual cues to help with navigation across the world map, and additional cutscenes relating to Cloud&#x27;s past.

===PC version===
A version for PC was developed by Square&#x27;s Costa Mesa offices. Square invested in a PC version to reach as wide a player base as possible; many Western consumers did not own a PlayStation, and Square&#x27;s deal with Sony did not prohibit such a port. Having never released a title for PC, Square decided to treat the port as a sales experiment. The port was handled by a team of 15 to 20 people, mostly from Costa Mesa but with help from Tokyo. Square did not begin the port until the console version was finished. The team needed to rewrite an estimated 80% of the game&#x27;s code, due to the need to unify what had been a custom build for a console written by multiple staff members. Consequently, programmers faced problems such as having to unify the original PlayStation version&#x27;s five different game engines, leading to delays. The PC version came with a license for Yamaha Corporation&#x27;s software synthesizer S-YXG70, allowing high-quality sequenced music despite varying sound hardware setups on different user computers. The conversion of the nearly 100 original musical pieces to XG format files was done by Yamaha.

To maximize their chances of success, Square searched for a Western company to assist with releasing the PC version. Eidos Interactive, whose release of &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; had turned them into a publishing giant, agreed to market and publish the port. The port was announced in December 1997, along with Eidos&#x27; exclusivity deal for North America and Europe at the time, though the port was rumored to happen as early as December 1996, prior to the PlayStation version&#x27;s release. To help the product stand out in stores, Eidos chose a trapezoidal shape for the cover and box. They agreed on a contract price of $1.8 million, making initial sales forecasts of 100,000 units based on that outlay. The PC version was released in North America and Europe on June 25, 1998; the port was not released in Japan. Within one month, sales of the port exceeded the initial forecasts. The PC version would end up providing the source code for subsequent ports.

===Localization===

Localization of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; was handled internally by Square. The English localization, led by Seth Luisi, was completed by a team of about fifty people and faced a variety of problems. According to Luisi, the biggest hurdle was making &quot;the direct Japanese-to-English text translation read correctly in English. The sentence structure and grammar rules for the Japanese language is very different from English&quot;, making it difficult for the translation to read like native English without distorting the meaning. Michael Basket was the sole translator for the project, though he received the help of native Japanese speakers from the Tokyo office. The localization was taxing for the team due to their inexperience, lack of professional editors, and poor communication between the North American and Japanese offices. A result of this disconnect was the original localization of Aerith&#x27;s name—which was intended as a conflation of &quot;air&quot; and &quot;earth&quot;—as &quot;Aeris&quot; due to a lack of communication between localization staff and the QA team.

The team also faced several technical issues due to programming practices which took little account of subsequent localization, such as dealing with a fixed-width font and having to insert kanji through language input keys to add special characters (for example, vowels with diacritics) to keep the code working. Consequently, the text was still read as Japanese by the word processor; the computer&#x27;s spellcheck could not be used, and mistakes had to be caught manually. The code used obscure kanji to refer to main character&#x27;s names, which made it unintuitive for the translators to identify characters. Translated text usually takes up more space than the Japanese text, though still had to fit to the screen appropriately without overusing page breaks (for example, item names, which are written in kanji in Japanese language, could overflow message windows in translated text); to mitigate this problem, a proportional typeface was implemented into the source code to fit more text into the screen. Swear words were used frequently in the localization to help convey the original Japanese meaning, though most profanities were censored in a manner described by Square employee Richard Honeywood as the &quot;old comic book &#x27;@#$%!&#x27;-type replacement&quot;. The European release was described as being in a worse condition, as the translations into multiple European languages were outsourced by Sony to another company, further hindering communication. For the PC port, Square attempted to fix translation and grammar mistakes for the North American and European versions but did not have the time and budget to retranslate all the text. According to Honeywood, the success of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; in the West encouraged Square to focus more on localization quality; on future games, Square hired additional translators and editors, while also streamlining communication between the development and localization teams.

Some months prior to the game&#x27;s North American release, Sony publicly stated that it was considering cutting the scene at the Honey Bee Inn due to the salacious content, prompting numerous online petitions and letters of protest from RPG fans. Square subsequently stated that it would never allow Sony to localize the game in any way. In addition to translating the text, the North American localization team made tweaks to the gameplay, including reducing the enemy encounter rate, simplifying the Materia menu, and adding new boss fights.

===Later releases===
The &quot;International&quot; version of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; was released on PlayStation Network (PSN) as a PSOne Classic in Japan on April 10, 2009. This version was compatible with both PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable with support for PlayStation Vita and PlayStation TV coming later. &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; was later released as a PSOne Classic in North America, Europe, and Australia on June 2. The PC version was updated by DotEmu for use on modern operating systems and released via Square Enix&#x27;s North American and European online stores on August 14, 2012. It included high-resolution support, cloud saves, achievements and a character booster. It would later be released via Steam on July 4, 2013, replacing the version available on Square Enix&#x27;s North American and European online stores. The PC version would be released in Japan for the first time on May 16, 2013, exclusively via Square Enix&#x27;s Japanese online store with the &quot;International&quot; version title. It has features unavailable in the western version including high-speed mode, no random encounters mode, and a max stats command. A release for iOS, based on the PC version and adjusted for mobile devices by D4 Enterprise, was released on August 19, 2015, with an auto-save feature. The PC version was released for PlayStation 4 on December 5, 2015. DotEmu developed the PS4 version. The game was also released for Android on July 7, 2016, for the PlayStation Classic on December 3, 2018, and for the Nintendo Switch and Xbox One worldwide on March 26, 2019.

==Reception and sales==


Within three days of its release in Japan, &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; sold over two million copies. This popularity inspired thousands of retailers in North America to break street dates in September to meet public demand for the title. In the game&#x27;s debut weekend in North America, it sold 330,000 copies, and had reached sales of 500,000 copies in less than three weeks. The momentum established in the game&#x27;s opening weeks continued for several months; Sony announced the game had sold one million copies in North America by early December, prompting business analyst Edward Williams from Monness, Crespi, Hardt &amp; Co. to comment that &quot;Sony redefined the role-playing game (RPG) category and expanded the conventional audience with the launch of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;&quot;. According to &quot;Weekly Famitsu&quot;, &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; sold 3.27 million units in Japan by the end of 1997. By the end of 2005, the PlayStation version had sold 9.8 million copies including 4 million sales in Japan, making it the highest-selling game in the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series. By the end of 2006, &quot;The Best&quot;, the bargain reissue of the game, had sold over 158,000 copies in Japan. By May 2010, it had sold over 10 million copies worldwide, making it the most popular title in the series in terms of units sold. The original PC version surpassed Eidos&#x27; expectations: while initially forecast to sell 100,000 units, it quickly exceeded sales of one million units, garnering royalties of over $2 million for Square. By August 2015, the PlayStation and PC versions had sold over 11 million units worldwide. Steam Spy estimated the game to have sold over 1.2 million downloads on Steam as of April 2018, with a later Steam leak estimating it had 1.14 million players on the platform as of July 2018. As of June 2020, the game has sold more than 13.3 million units worldwide. As of September 2023, the original version of the game has sold over 14.4 million units worldwide.

The game received widespread acclaim from critics upon release. It was referred to by &quot;GameFan&quot; as &quot;quite possibly the greatest game ever made&quot;, a quote selected for the back cover of the game&#x27;s jewel case. &quot;GameSpot&quot; commented that &quot;never before have technology, playability, and narrative combined as well as in &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;&quot;, expressing particular favor toward the game&#x27;s graphics, audio, and story. The four reviewers of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; unanimously gave it a 9.5 out of 10 and their &quot;Game of the Month&quot; award, lauding its rendered backgrounds, use of FMV, battles, and especially the story line, though they expressed disappointment that the ending didn&#x27;t resolve all of the loose ends. They also considered the North American localization a dramatic improvement over the original Japanese version. &quot;GamePro&quot; gave it a perfect 5.0 out of 5 in all four categories (graphics, sound, control, and fun factor), calling the storytelling &quot;dramatic, sentimental, and touching in a way that draws you into the characters&quot;, who &quot;come alive thanks to sweetly subtle body movements&quot;. Both &quot;GamePro&quot; and &quot;Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine&quot; (&quot;OPM&quot;) said the ATB system gives battles a tension and urgency not usually seen in RPGs, and OPM called the summon animations &quot;absolutely awe-inspiring&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot;″s Jay Boor insisted the game&#x27;s graphics were &quot;light years beyond anything ever seen on the PlayStation&quot;, and regarded its battle system as its strongest point.

&quot;Computer and Video Games&quot;″s Alex C praised the dramatic story and well-developed characters. In addition to calling the graphics &quot;bar none the best the PlayStation has ever seen&quot;, &quot;Next Generation&quot; said of the story that &quot;while &quot;FFVII&quot; may take a bit to get going, as in every entry in the series, moments of high melodrama are blended with scenes of sheer poetry and vision&quot;. &quot;Edge&quot; noted that &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; had come close to being an interactive movie in playable form, praising its combination of a complex story that went against Western graphic adventures trends and &quot;excellently orchestrated chip music&quot;. RPGamer praised the game&#x27;s soundtrack, both in variety and sheer volume, stating that &quot;Uematsu has done his work exceptionally well&quot; and saying that it was potentially his best work. &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; has received some negative criticism. &quot;OPM&quot; and &quot;GameSpot&quot; questioned the game&#x27;s linear progression. &quot;OPM&quot; considered the game&#x27;s translation &quot;a bit muddy&quot;. Similarly, &quot;RPGamer&quot; cited its translation as &quot;packed with typos and other errors which further obscure what is already a very confusing plot&quot;. &quot;GamePro&quot; also considered the Japanese-to-English translation a significant weakness in the game, and &quot;IGN&quot; regarded the ability to use only three characters at a time as &quot;the game&#x27;s only shortcoming&quot;.

Reviewers gave similar praise to the PC version but criticized its various technical faults. &quot;Computer Games Magazine&quot; said that no other recent game had the same &quot;tendency to fail to work in any capacity on multiple [computers]&quot;. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; complained that the music quality suffered on PC sound cards, and &quot;Next Generation&quot; found the game&#x27;s pre-rendered backgrounds significantly less impressive than those of the PlayStation version. However, the latter magazine found the higher-resolution battle visuals &quot;absolutely stunning&quot;, and &quot;Computer Games Magazine&quot; said that they showed off the potential graphical power of PCs. All three magazines concluded by praising the game despite its technical flaws, and &quot;PC Gamer&quot; summarized that, while &quot;Square apparently did only what was required to get its PlayStation game running under Windows&quot;, &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; is &quot;still a winner on the PC&quot;.

===Awards===
&quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; was given numerous Game of the Year awards in 1997. At the second CESA Awards, it won the Grand Prize, Scenario Award and Sound Award. During the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences&#x27; inaugural Interactive Achievement Awards, &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; won in the categories of &quot;Console Adventure Game of the Year&quot; and &quot;Console Role-Playing Game of the Year&quot;; it also received nominations for &quot;Interactive Title of the Year&quot;, &quot;Console Game of the Year&quot;, &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Art/Graphics&quot;, and &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Interactive Design&quot;. In the Origins Awards, it won in the category &quot;Best Roleplaying Computer Game of 1997&quot;. &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; was awarded Game of the Year by magazines including &quot;Game Informer&quot;, &quot;GamePro&quot;, and &quot;Hyper&quot;. It was also awarded the &quot;Readers&#x27; Choice All Systems Game of the Year&quot;, &quot;Readers&#x27; Choice PlayStation Game of the Year&quot; and &quot;Readers&#x27; Choice Role-Playing Game of the Year&quot; by &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; (&quot;EGM&quot;), which gave it Editors&#x27; Choice Awards for &quot;Role-Playing Game of the Year&quot; and &quot;Best Graphics&quot; (plus a runner-up slot for &quot;Game of the Year&quot;), and also gave it awards for &quot;Hottest Video Game Babe&quot; (for Tifa Lockhart), &quot;Most Hype for a Game&quot;, &quot;Best Ending&quot;, and &quot;Best Print Ad&quot;.

Since 1997, it has been selected by many game magazines as one of the top video games of all time, listed as 91st in &quot;EGM&quot;″s 2001 &quot;100 Best Games of All Time&quot;, and as fourth in &quot;Retro Gamer&quot;″s &quot;Top 100 Games&quot; in 2004. In 2018, it was ranked 99th in &quot;IGN&quot;″s &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time&quot; and as third in PALGN&#x27;s &quot;The Greatest 100 Games Ever&quot;. &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; was included in &quot;The Greatest Games of All Time&quot; list by GameSpot in 2006, and ranked as second in &quot;Empire&quot;″s 2006 &quot;100 Greatest Games of All Time&quot;, as third in &quot;Stuff&quot;″s &quot;100 Greatest Games&quot; in 2008 and as 15th in &quot;Game Informer&quot;″s 2009 &quot;Top 200 Games of All Time&quot; (down five places from its previous best games of all-time list). &quot;GameSpot&quot; placed it as the second most influential game ever made in 2002; in 2007, &quot;GamePro&quot; ranked it 14th on the list of the most important games of all time, and in 2009 it finished in the same place on their list of the most innovative games of all time. In 2012, &quot;Time&quot; named it one of their &quot;All-Time 100 Video Games&quot;. In March 2018, &quot;Game Informer&quot;″s &quot;Readers Choice Top 300 Games of All Time&quot;, &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; ranked in seventh place. In March 2018, &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; rated &quot;The 25 best PS1 games of all time&quot;, &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; was ranked in 12th place.

It has also appeared in numerous other greatest game lists. In 2007, &quot;Dengeki PlayStation&quot; gave it the &quot;Best Story&quot;, &quot;Best RPG&quot; and &quot;Best Overall Game&quot; retrospective awards for games on the original PlayStation. &quot;GamePro&quot; named it the best RPG title of all time in 2008, and featured it in their 2010 article &quot;The 30 Best PSN Games&quot;. In 2012, GamesRadar also ranked it as the sixth saddest game ever. On the other hand, &quot;GameSpy&quot; ranked it seventh on their 2003 list of the most overrated games.

&quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; has often placed at or near the top of many reader polls of all-time best games. It was voted the &quot;Reader&#x27;s Choice Game of the Century&quot; in an &quot;IGN&quot; poll in 2000, and placed second in the &quot;Top 100 Favorite Games of All Time&quot; by Japanese magazine &quot;Famitsu&quot; in 2006 (it was also voted as ninth in &quot;Famitsu&quot;″s 2011 poll of most tear-inducing games of all time). Users of GameFAQs voted it the &quot;Best Game Ever&quot; in 2004 and in 2005, and placed it second in 2009. In 2008, readers of &quot;Dengeki&quot; magazine voted it the best game ever made, as well as the ninth most tear-inducing game of all time.

==Legacy==

The game inspired an unofficial version for the NES by Chinese company Shenzhen Nanjing Technology. This port features the &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; game scaled back to 2D, with some of the side quests removed. The game&#x27;s popularity and open-ended nature also led director Kitase and scenario writer Nojima to establish a plot-related connection between &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy X-2&quot;. The character Shinra from &quot;X-2&quot; proposes the concept of extracting the life energy from within the planet Spira. Nojima has stated that Shinra and his proposal are a deliberate nod to the Shinra Company and that he envisioned the events of &quot;Final Fantasy X-2&quot; as a prequel to those in &quot;VII&quot;. The advances in technology used to create the FMV sequences and computer graphics for &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; allowed Sakaguchi to begin production on the first &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; film, &quot;Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within&quot;. The game introduced a particular aesthetic to the series—fantasy suffused with modern-to-advanced technology—which was explored further in &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot;, &quot;The Spirits Within&quot;, and &quot;XV&quot;. Re-releases of Square games in Japan with bonus features would occur frequently after the release of &quot;Final Fantasy VII International&quot;. Later titles that would be re-released as international versions include &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; and other follow-ups from the franchise, as well as the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; series.

&quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; is credited as having the largest impact of the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series, and with allowing console role-playing games to gain mass-market appeal outside of Japan. Aerith&#x27;s death in the game has often been referred to as one of the most significant moments from any video game. In addition, &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; is also noted for its use of the unreliable narrator literary concept, drawing comparisons to films such as &quot;Fight Club&quot; (1999), &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; (1999), &quot;American Psycho&quot; (2000) and &quot;Memento&quot; (2000). Patrick Holleman and Jeremy Parish argue that the game takes the unreliable narrator concept a step further, with its interactivity establishing a connection between the player and the protagonist Cloud, setting &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; apart from films as well as other video games. According to Holleman, &quot;no RPG has ever deliberately betrayed the connection between protagonist and player like &quot;FFVII&quot; does&quot;. Harry Mackin writing for &quot;Paste&quot; called the game &quot;a subversion that deconstructs and comments meaningfully on how we think about heroism, masculinity and identity in videogame storytelling&quot;. Ric Manning of &quot;The Courier-Journal&quot; noted elements of psychoanalysis in the game. The game is also noted for its cyberpunk themes; &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; called it one of the best games of the genre, and &quot;Paste Magazine&quot; compared its cyberpunk city of Midgar to &quot;Akira&quot; and &quot;Blade Runner&quot;. According to &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot;, the game&#x27;s climate change theme is more meaningful in 2019 than it was in 1997.

Several characters from &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; have made cameo appearances in other Square Enix titles, most notably the fighting game &quot;Ehrgeiz&quot; and the popular &quot;Final-Fantasy&quot;-to-Disney crossover series &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;. Additionally, fighting video game &quot;Dissidia Final Fantasy&quot; includes &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; characters such as Cloud and Sephiroth, and allows players to fight with characters from throughout the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series, and its follow-up, &quot;Dissidia 012&quot;, included Tifa as well. Cloud is also a playable character in &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot;. In December 2015, Cloud was released as a downloadable content character for the Nintendo crossover fighting game &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U&quot;, along with a stage based on Midgar. He returned in the 2018 sequel, &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;, with Sephiroth being added as downloadable content in December 2020.

===Related media and merchandise===

The world of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; is explored further in the &quot;Compilation of Final Fantasy VII&quot;, a series of games, animated features, and short stories. The first title in the &quot;Compilation&quot; is the mobile game &quot;Before Crisis&quot;, a prequel focusing on the Turks&#x27; activities six years before the original game. The CGI film sequel &quot;Advent Children&quot;, set two years after the game, was the first title announced but the second to be released. Special DVD editions of the film included &quot;Last Order&quot;, an original video animation that recounts the destruction of Nibelheim. &quot;Dirge of Cerberus&quot; and its mobile phone counterpart, &quot;Dirge of Cerberus Lost Episode: Final Fantasy VII&quot;, are third-person shooters set one year after &quot;Advent Children&quot;. &quot;Dirge&quot; focuses on the backstory of Vincent Valentine, whose history was left mostly untold in &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;. The most recent title is the PlayStation Portable game &quot;Crisis Core&quot;, an action role-playing game that centers on Zack&#x27;s past.

Releases not under the &quot;Compilation&quot; label include &quot;Maiden Who Travels the Planet&quot;, which follows Aerith&#x27;s journey in the Lifestream after her death, taking place concurrently with the second half of the original game. In 1998, the &quot;Official Final Fantasy VII Strategy Guide&quot; was licensed by SquareSoft and published by Brady Games. &quot;Final Fantasy VII Snowboarding&quot; is a mobile port of the snowboard minigame featured in the original game, featuring different courses for the player to tackle. The game is downloadable on V Cast-compatible mobile phones and was first made available in 2005 in Japan and North America.

&quot;Final Fantasy VII G-Bike&quot; is a mobile game released for iOS and Android in December 2014, based on the motorbike minigame featured in the original game. In September 2007, Square Enix published &quot;Final Fantasy VII 10th Anniversary Ultimania&quot;. This book is an in-depth compilation of &quot;FFVII&quot; story-line and artwork. The Universal Studios Theme Park in Japan is developing a &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; themed virtual reality attraction.

===Remakes===

With the announcement and development of the &quot;Compilation of Final Fantasy VII&quot;, speculation spread that a remake of the original &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; would be released for the PlayStation 3. This conjecture was sparked by the release of a video featuring the opening sequence of &quot;FFVII&quot; recreated using the PlayStation 3&#x27;s graphical capabilities at E3 2005. After a decade of speculation, a remake was announced at E3 2015. The game saw changes made to its story and combat system. The game is planned to be released over three installments, with the first part being released for the PlayStation 4 in 2020. The follow-up, &quot;Final Fantasy VII Rebirth&quot;, was released for PlayStation 5 in February 2024. &quot;Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion&quot;, a remaster of &quot;Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII&quot;, which was released in December 2022, is also considered a prequel to the larger &quot;Final Fantasy VII Remake&quot; project.

<doc id="52757" wikidata="Q245006" url="?curid=52757" title="Final Fantasy VIII">
<text>is a 1999 role-playing video game developed and published by Square for the PlayStation console. It is the eighth main installment in the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series. Set on an unnamed fantasy world with science fiction elements, the game follows a group of young mercenaries, led by Squall Leonhart, as they are drawn into a conflict sparked by a sorceress named Edea Kramer who seized control of a powerful military state. During the quest to defeat the sorceress and the forces manipulating her, Squall struggles with his role as leader and develops a romance with one of his comrades, Rinoa Heartilly.

Development began in 1997, during the English localization of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;. The game builds on the visual changes brought to the series by &quot;VII&quot;, including the use of 3D graphics and pre-rendered backgrounds, while also departing from many &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; traditions. It is the first &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; to use realistically proportioned characters consistently, feature a vocal piece as its theme music and forgo the use of magic points for spellcasting.

&quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot; was well received by critics. The game was a commercial success, grossing in its first day of release in Japan, and more than during its first 13 weeks in North America, making it the fastest-selling &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; title until &quot;Final Fantasy XIII&quot;, a multi-platform release. A Windows port followed in 2000, with the addition of the &quot;Chocobo World&quot; minigame. &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot; was re-released worldwide as a PSOne Classic on the PlayStation Store in 2009, for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable, with support for PlayStation Vita in 2012. It was re-released via Steam in 2013. By August 2019, it had sold more than 9.6 million copies worldwide. A remastered version was released for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One in September 2019, and Android and iOS in March 2021.

==Gameplay==
Like the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games before it, &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot; consists of three main modes of play: the world map, the field map, and the battle screen. The world map is a 3D display in which the player may navigate freely across a small-scale rendering of the game world. Characters travel across the world map in a variety of ways, including by foot, car, Chocobo, train, and airship. The field map consists of controllable 3D characters overlaid on one or more 2D pre-rendered backgrounds, which represent environmental locations such as towns or forests. The battle screen is a 3D model of a location such as a street or room, where turn-based fights between playable characters and CPU-controlled enemies take place. The interface is menu-driven, as in previous titles, but with the typical weapon and armor systems removed and new features present, such as the Junction system. Also featured is a collectible card-based minigame called &quot;Triple Triad&quot;.
For &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot;, Hiroyuki Ito designed a battle system based on summoned monsters, called &quot;Guardian Forces&quot;, abbreviated in-game as &quot;GF&quot;. Assigning (&quot;junctioning&quot;) a GF onto a character allows the player to use battle commands beyond &quot;Attack&quot; with the main weapon, such as Magic, GF (to have a junctioned GF perform an action), and Item. Previous titles provided each character with a limited pool of magic points that were consumed by each spell; in &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot;, spells are acquired (&quot;drawn&quot;) either from enemies in battle, Draw Points distributed throughout the environments, or by refining items and cards. Spells are then stocked on characters as quantified inventory (up to 100 per spell and limited to 32 distinct spells per character) and are consumed one by one when used. Characters can also junction (equip) these spells onto their statistics—such as Strength, Vitality, and Luck—for various bonuses, provided the character has junctioned a Guardian Force. The junction system&#x27;s flexibility affords the player a wide range of customization.

These expanded mechanics for summons were a departure for the series; in previous titles, summons were relegated to a single action during battle. The junction system also acts as a substitute for armor and accessories, which were used in earlier games to modify character statistics. Moreover, where earlier titles required weapons to be equipped and tailored to the character, each major character in &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot; features a unique weapon which can be upgraded, affecting its appearance, power, and Limit Break.

As in &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, characters in &quot;VIII&quot; have unique abilities called &quot;Limit Breaks&quot;, which range from powerful attacks to support spells. While the characters in &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; receive Limit Breaks after incurring significant damage, in &quot;VIII&quot;, Limit Breaks become available only at low health (hit points) under normal circumstances. The magic spell &quot;Aura&quot; increases the probability of Limit Breaks appearing, regardless of a character&#x27;s remaining hit points, while various status afflictions can prevent Limit Breaks. They are similar to the Desperation Attacks of &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;, albeit more frequent. &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot; also introduced interactive elements to complement Limit Break animations. These interactive sequences, which vary between character, weapon, and Limit Break, range from randomly selected magic spells to precisely timed button inputs. Successfully completing an interactive sequence increases the potency of the Limit Break.
&quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot; features an experience point (EXP) system quite different from previous titles. The essentials remain unchanged: characters gain EXP after defeating enemies, which are typically encountered randomly throughout the game&#x27;s environments. Earning a set amount of EXP causes the character to gain a level, which increases their overall statistics. While previous titles feature an EXP curve that increases with each level (e.g. getting to level 2 requires 200 EXP, level 3 requires 400, etc.), characters in &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot; gain a level after accumulating a flat rate of 1000 points. Enemy levels scale based on the party&#x27;s average level; in most RPGs at the time, enemy levels remain stagnant. Some bosses have level caps to prevent the main quest from becoming too difficult. Higher-level enemies are capable of inflicting and withstanding significantly more damage, may have additional special attacks, and carry additional magic spells, allowing for Junctioning bonuses which themselves far exceed the bonuses imparted by level-gain. The game&#x27;s unique EXP and level system allows a player to grind to maximum Level 100 before even beginning the plot, though this will result in far more powerful enemies.

In addition to gaining levels, Guardian Forces earn Ability Points (AP) after battles, which are automatically allocated to special abilities that Guardian Forces can learn. When a Guardian Force has learned an ability, that ability becomes available for any character or the character party, as is the case with field abilities. These abilities allow characters to attack more efficiently, refine magic spells from items, receive stat bonuses upon leveling up, access shops remotely, and use additional battle commands.

==Plot==
===Setting and characters===

Most of &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot; is set on an unnamed fantasy world. The setting is highly European in design and features a blend of modern and futuristic locales. The planet contains five major landmasses, with Esthar, the largest, covering most of the eastern portion of the map. Galbadia, the second-largest continent, lies to the west, and contains many of the game&#x27;s locations. The northernmost landmass is Trabia, an Arctic region. Positioned roughly in the middle of the world map lies Balamb, the smallest continent, the island on which the game begins. The remaining landmass is small and mostly desolate, riddled with rough, rocky terrain caused by the impact of a &quot;Lunar Cry&quot;, an event where monsters from the moon fall to the planet. The southernmost landmass includes an archipelago of broken sections of land that have drifted apart. Islands and marine structures flesh out the game world, and a handful of off-world locations round out the playable areas.

The six main protagonists of &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot; are: Squall Leonhart, a loner who avoids vulnerability by focusing on his duty; Rinoa Heartilly, an outspoken and passionate young woman who follows her heart; Quistis Trepe, an instructor with a serious, patient attitude; Zell Dincht, an energetic martial artist with a fondness for hot dogs; Selphie Tilmitt, a cheerful girl who loves trains and pilots the airship &quot;Ragnarok&quot;; and Irvine Kinneas, a charismatic and promiscuous marksman. All but Rinoa are members of &quot;SeeD&quot;, an elite military force based out of futuristic installations called Gardens. Temporarily playable characters include Laguna Loire, Kiros Seagill, and Ward Zabac, who appear in &quot;flashback&quot; sequences; SeeD cadet-turned-antagonist Seifer Almasy; and sorceress Edea Kramer. The main antagonist is Ultimecia, a sorceress from the future who wishes to compress time.

===Story===
Squall and Seifer spar with each other while training outside Balamb Garden, giving each other scars in the process. Meanwhile, the Republic of Galbadia invades the Dollet Dukedom, forcing Dollet to hire SeeD. The school uses the mission as a final exam for its cadets; with the help of his instructor, Quistis, Squall passes the mission&#x27;s prerequisite and is grouped with Seifer and Zell. Selphie replaces Seifer mid-mission when the latter disobeys orders and abandons his team. SeeD halts the Galbadian advance; Squall, Zell, and Selphie graduate to SeeD status, but Seifer is disciplined for his disobedience. During the graduation party, Squall meets Rinoa, whose personality is the opposite of his. When assigned with Zell and Selphie to help Rinoa&#x27;s resistance in Galbadian-occupied Timber, Squall learns that Sorceress Edea is behind Galbadia&#x27;s recent hostilities. Under orders from Garden, Squall and his comrades—joined by Rinoa, Quistis, and Irvine—attempt to assassinate Edea. During the effort, Squall&#x27;s party also learns that Seifer has left Garden to become Edea&#x27;s second-in-command. Edea survives the attempt, stabs Squall in the shoulder with an ice shard, and detains the party.

After Squall&#x27;s party escapes the prison they were sent to, Edea destroys Trabia Garden in a retaliatory missile strike and prepares to attack Balamb Garden. Selphie delays the launch while Squall&#x27;s team returns to Balamb Garden and activates its mobile functions to evade the missiles. Garden cannot be controlled, however, and it crashes into the docks at Fishermans&#x27; Horizon. While Garden is being repaired, Galbadia invades the town in search of a girl named Ellone, who had been staying at Balamb Garden. Before leaving, Ellone reveals that she has been &quot;sending&quot; Squall and his team into flashbacks set 17 years earlier in a vain effort to alter history. The scenes center on Laguna and his friends as he evolves from Galbadian soldier (where he shared a crush with Rinoa&#x27;s future mother Julia) to village protector (where he served as caretaker to Ellone alongside a bartender named Raine) to leader of an Estharian resistance against Sorceress Adel. Ellone eventually escapes to Esthar, the world&#x27;s technological superpower.

Meanwhile, Squall confronts his personal anxieties fueled by ongoing developments, such as Headmaster Cid appointing him as SeeD&#x27;s new leader and his increasing attraction to Rinoa. Squall and his comrades learn that they, along with Seifer and Ellone but minus Rinoa, were all raised in an orphanage run by Edea; after eventual separation, they later developed amnesia due to their use of Guardian Forces, except Irvine, who did not use them. Cid and Edea had established Garden and SeeD primarily to defeat corrupt sorceresses. After these revelations, the forces of Balamb Garden defeat the Galbadian Army, led by Seifer, aboard Galbadia Garden. Edea is also defeated by SeeD, but the party learns that Edea is merely an unwilling host for Ultimecia, who planned to use Ellone to help achieve time compression. Ultimecia transfers her powers to Rinoa; Edea survives, but Rinoa enters a coma. Squall travels to Esthar to find Ellone, as he believes that she can help save Rinoa.

While Rinoa is being treated on Esthar&#x27;s space station, Ultimecia uses her to free Adel from an orbital prison. Ultimecia then orders Seifer to activate the Lunatic Pandora facility, inciting a Lunar Cry that sends Adel&#x27;s containment device to the planet. Having selected Adel as her next host, Ultimecia abandons Rinoa in outer space. Squall rescues her, and they return to the planet on a derelict starship and share a romantic moment; Ellone is captured by Galbadia shortly thereafter. After landing, the party encounters Laguna, now President of Esthar; he reveals Dr. Odine&#x27;s plan to allow Ultimecia to cast time compression on their terms so that Ellone can send SeeD into Ultimecia&#x27;s time period. At Lunatic Pandora, Squall&#x27;s team defeats Seifer, rescues Ellone, and kills Adel; Ultimecia possesses Rinoa and begins casting time compression. Ellone sends Squall&#x27;s team into Ultimecia&#x27;s era, where she is defeated in a fierce battle before time compression can be fully achieved.

Squall, lost in time and space, witnesses the dying Ultimecia traveling back in time to pass her powers to Edea. Rinoa finds him unconscious, and they return together to their restored world and time. Seifer is reunited with his companions, Laguna and Ellone visit Raine&#x27;s grave, and the SeeD celebrate their victory at Balamb Garden. Squall and Rinoa share a kiss under the moonlight.

==Development==
Development of &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot; began in 1997, during the English-language translation of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;. As with much of the production of &quot;VII&quot;, series creator and veteran Hironobu Sakaguchi served as the executive producer, working primarily on the development of &quot;Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within&quot; and leaving direction of &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot; to Yoshinori Kitase. Shinji Hashimoto was assigned to be the producer in Sakaguchi&#x27;s place, while the game and battle system were designed by Kitase and Hiroyuki Ito, respectively. One of the development difficulties encountered was having three real-time characters exploring an environment at the same time. The card game &quot;Triple Triad&quot; was conceived and implemented by programmer Kentarow Yasui. The concept was derived from trading cards which is a popular hobby in some parts of Japan. &quot;Triple Triad&quot; was meant to keep the player&#x27;s interest during long stretches without cutscenes. Originally, it was simply about collecting cards but Yasui considered this too disconnected from the main game and &quot;begged&quot; for the inclusion of an ability to transform cards into items. The game&#x27;s total development costs were approximately or $30 million (equivalent to $ million in ). The staff consisted of about 180 people.

Following the turbulent development of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, there was a shake-up of Square&#x27;s localization process. &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot; was the first title to have extensive communication between the Japanese and North American teams during the process. Lead translator Richard Honeywood wrote a text parser that would automatically convert text from English ASCII to Shift JIS format required by the game engine&#x27;s compiler, streamlining the translation process dramatically. The game was the first major project of Alexander O. Smith, who would later earn acclaim for his work on &quot;Vagrant Story&quot;. Smith said that due to a lack of communication with the development team, they were surprised that an IT employee used GameShark to access text files for localizing to Western audiences. The translation was finished by September 1999. The game&#x27;s European release was delayed due to necessary graphical changes; the cited example was the removal of a Nazi-like uniform.

===Visual design===
From the beginning, Kitase knew he wanted a thematic combination of fantasy and realism. To this end, he aimed to include a cast of characters who appeared to be ordinary people. Character designer and battle visual director Tetsuya Nomura and art director Yusuke Naora strove to achieve this impression through the inclusion of realistically proportioned characters, a departure from the super deformed designs used in the previous title. Additionally, Naora attempted to enhance the realism of the world through predominantly bright lighting effects with shadows distributed as appropriate. Other measures taken included implementing rental cars for travel in-game, and the use of motion capture technology to give the game&#x27;s characters lifelike movements in the game&#x27;s full motion video sequences. The FMV sequences were created by a team of roughly 35 people, with the total cinematic run-time being estimated at over an hour, approximately 20 minutes longer than the FMV sequences in &quot;VII&quot;. Motion capture was used to give a general realism to character movement, but the team favored manual animation over relying on motion capture. A major challenge was the technical advances made since the release of &quot;VII&quot;, and the aim for more realistic characters. A major issue with the cutscenes was having real-time character models moving across environments within an FMV.

In an interview with &quot;Famitsu&quot;, Naora described that the game was generally designed to be a &quot;bright, fresh &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;&quot;. The main reason was that the team had dealt extensively with dark and &quot;weird&quot; imagery with &quot;VII&quot;. The designers felt a need to invert the atmosphere of previous games in the series, which had feelings of &quot;light emerging from darkness&quot;. This decision was easy for the developers to make, because most of them had worked on &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; and felt that a new direction was acceptable. The world designs were also developed with the knowledge that most of the staff were now used to computer graphics, which was not the case with &quot;VII&quot;. The developers also noted that with &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot;, they attempted to &quot;mix future, real life and fantasy&quot;. As part of a theme desired by Kitase to give the game a foreign atmosphere, various designs were given to its locations using the style of internationally familiar places, while also maintaining a fantasy atmosphere. Inspiration ranged from ancient Egyptian and Greek architecture, to the city of Paris, France, to an idealized futuristic European society. Flags were also given to some factions, their designs based on the group&#x27;s history and culture.

To maintain a foreign atmosphere, the characters of the game were designed to have predominantly European appearances. The first &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot; character created was Squall. Desiring to add a unique angle to Squall&#x27;s appearance and emphasize his role as the central character, Nomura gave him a scar across his brow and the bridge of his nose. As there was not yet a detailed history conceived for the character, Nomura left the explanation for Squall&#x27;s scar to scenario writer Kazushige Nojima. Squall was given a gunblade, a fictional revolver–sword hybrid that functions primarily as a sword, with an added damaging vibration feature activated by use of its gun mechanism, similar to a vibroblade. His character design was complemented by a fur lining along the collar of his jacket, incorporated by Nomura as a challenge for the game&#x27;s full motion video designers. Additionally, some designs Nomura had previously drawn, but had not yet used in a &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; game, were incorporated into &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot;. These were the designs of Edea, Fujin and Raijin. The latter two had originally been designed for use in &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, but with the inclusion of the Turks characters in that game, it was felt that Fujin and Raijin were unnecessary. Nomura had designed Edea before the development of &quot;VII&quot;, based on the style of Yoshitaka Amano. For the Guardian Forces, Nomura felt they should be unique beings, without clothes or other human-like concepts. This was problematic, as he did not want them to &quot;become the actual monsters&quot;, so he took great care in their design. Leviathan was the first GF, created as a test and included in a game demo. After it received a positive reaction from players, Nomura decided to create the remaining sequences in a similar fashion.

===Story development===
The plot of &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot; was conceived by Kitase, with the story and the characters provided by Nomura and the actual scenario written by Nojima. During the game&#x27;s pre-production, Nomura suggested the game be given a &quot;school days&quot; feel. Nojima already had a story in mind in which the main characters were the same age; their ideas meshed, taking form as the &quot;Garden&quot; military academies. Nojima planned that the two playable parties featured in the game (Squall&#x27;s present day group and Laguna&#x27;s group from the past) would be highly contrasted with one another. This idea was conveyed through the age and experience of Laguna&#x27;s group, versus the youth and naïveté of Squall&#x27;s group. Nojima has expressed that the dynamic of players&#x27; relationships with the protagonist is important to him. Both &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; and &quot;VIII&quot; feature reserved, quiet protagonists in the form of Cloud Strife and Squall. With &quot;VIII&quot;, however, Nojima worked to give players actual insight into what the character was thinking, a direct contrast with his handling of &quot;VII&quot;, which encouraged the player to speculate.

===Other media===
In March 1999, one month after the game&#x27;s release, &quot;Final Fantasy VIII Ultimania&quot; was published, a book that features an in-depth guide to &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot; and interviews with the developers. An origami book was released in November 1999. Later on September 22, a CD-ROM titled &quot;Final Fantasy VIII Desktop Accessories&quot; was released. It contains desktop icons, computer wallpapers, screensavers, and an e-mail application. It additionally features a stand-alone edition of the &quot;Triple Triad&quot; minigame, which allowed players to compete against one another via a local area network.

Also in 1999, the ballroom dance scene of &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot; was featured as a technical demo for the PlayStation 2. In 2000, a PC version was released for Windows. This port featured smoother graphics, enhanced audio, and the inclusion of &quot;Chocobo World&quot;, a minigame starring Boko, a Chocobo featured in one of the side-quests in &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot;. For most North American and European players, the PC version of the game was the only means of playing &quot;Chocobo World&quot;, as the game was originally designed to be played via the PocketStation, a handheld console never released outside Japan. &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot; was released on the Sony&#x27;s Greatest Hits on August 28, 2000. In 2009, the title was added to the PlayStation Store on the PlayStation Network.

&quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot; was re-released as part of the &quot;Final Fantasy 25th Anniversary Ultimate Box&quot; Japanese package in December 2012. An upscaled PC version was released on Steam on December 5, 2013.

===Music===

Regular series composer Nobuo Uematsu wrote the soundtrack for &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot;. He tried to base the songs on the emotional content of the scenes in which they would be played, asserting that expressing the emotions he desired was more important than improving skills, because &quot;I think it will be a shame if we won&#x27;t be able to cry as we play our own game&quot;. He could not determine a character&#x27;s emotions solely based on the plot, instead using images of appearance and attire: &quot;It&#x27;s important to know when their emotions are at their height, but it usually takes until a month before release for them to finish the ending dialog...!&quot; When IGN Music stated that the music of &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot; was very dark and perhaps influenced by the plot of the game, Uematsu said that &quot;the atmosphere of music varies depending on story line, of course, but it&#x27;s also my intention to put various types of music into one game&quot;. The absence of character themes found in the previous two games was due to Uematsu finding those of &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; and &quot;VII&quot; ineffective. Uematsu considers it reasonable to have character themes if each character has a &quot;highlight&quot; in the game, but he found &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot; only focused on Squall Leonhart and Rinoa Heartilly as a couple, resulting in the &quot;Eyes on Me&quot; theme.

The original soundtrack was released on four compact discs by DigiCube in Japan on March 10, 1999, and by Square Electronic Arts in North America as &quot;Final Fantasy VIII Music Collection&quot; in January 2000. It was republished worldwide by Square Enix on May 10, 2004. An album of orchestral arrangements of selected tracks from the game was released under the title &quot;Fithos Lusec Wecos Vinosec Final Fantasy VIII&quot; on November 19, 1999, by DigiCube, and subsequently published on July 22, 2004, by Square Enix. The pieces were arranged and conducted by Shirō Hamaguchi for a live orchestra. A collection of piano arrangements performed by Shinko Ogata was released under the title &quot;Piano Collections: Final Fantasy VIII&quot; by DigiCube on January 21, 2000, and subsequently re-published by Square Enix on July 22, 2004.

The score is best known for two songs: &quot;Liberi Fatali&quot;, a Latin choral piece that is played during the introduction to the game, and &quot;Eyes On Me&quot;, a pop song serving as the game&#x27;s theme, performed by Chinese singer Faye Wong. Near the end of the production of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, the developers suggested to use a singer, but abandoned the idea due to a lack of reasoning based on the game&#x27;s theme and storyline. However, Nobuo Uematsu thought a ballad would closely relate to the theme and characters of &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot;. This resulted in the game&#x27;s developers sharing &quot;countless&quot; artists, eventually deciding on Wong. Uematsu claims &quot;her voice and mood seem to match my image of the song exactly&quot;, and that her ethnicity &quot;fits the international image of &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;&quot;. After negotiations were made, &quot;Eyes on Me&quot; was recorded in Hong Kong with an orchestra. The song was released as a CD single in Japan and sold over 400,000 copies, setting the record for highest-selling video game music disc ever released in that country at the time. &quot;Liberi Fatali&quot; was played during the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens during the women&#x27;s synchronized swimming event.

The music of &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot; has appeared in various official &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; concerts. These include 2002&#x27;s &quot;20020220 Music from FINAL FANTASY&quot;, in which the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra played &quot;Liberi Fatali&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Afraid&quot;, &quot;Love Grows&quot;, and &quot;The Man with the Machine Gun&quot;, the 2004 &quot;Tour de Japon&quot; series, which featured &quot;The Oath&quot;, the &quot;Dear Friends&quot; series that began that same year and included &quot;Liberi Fatali&quot; and &quot;Love Grows&quot;, and the 2005 &quot;More Friends&quot; concert, which included &quot;Maybe I&#x27;m a Lion&quot;. More recent concerts include the &quot;Voices – Music from Final Fantasy&quot; 2006 concert showcasing &quot;Liberi Fatali&quot;, &quot;Fisherman&#x27;s Horizon&quot;, and &quot;Eyes on Me&quot; and the international &quot;Distant Worlds&quot; concert tour that continues to date, which includes &quot;Liberi Fatali&quot;, &quot;Fisherman&#x27;s Horizon&quot;, &quot;Man with the Machine Gun&quot;, and &quot;Love Grows&quot;. Several of these concerts have produced live albums as well. Music from the game has also been played in non &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;-specific concerts such as the &quot;Play! A Video Game Symphony&quot; world tour from 2006 onwards, for which Nobuo Uematsu composed the opening fanfare that accompanies each performance.

===&quot;Final Fantasy VIII Remastered&quot;===
A remastered version of &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot; was released in September 2019. The remaster, which features high definition graphics and improved character models, was produced in collaboration with Dotemu and Access Games, and was released on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One. It was later ported to Android and iOS, and released on March 24, 2021.

==Reception==
&quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot; received critical acclaim. In general, the game was compared favorably to its predecessors. Though questioning the game&#x27;s lack of voice overs for its characters, &quot;Game Revolution&quot; praised its storyline and ending. For their part, &quot;Edge&quot; labeled &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot; &quot;a far more accomplished game than &quot;FFVII&quot;&quot;. On the other hand, the magazine also felt that the game&#x27;s length left its story unable to &quot;offer consistently strong dialogue and sub-plots&quot;. Additionally, it found some of the story&#x27;s plot twists &quot;not... suitably manipulated and prepared&quot;, leaving it &quot;hard not to greet such... moments with anything but indifference&quot;. Overall, &quot;Edge&quot; considered &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot; to be &quot;yet another outstanding edition of SquareSoft&#x27;s far-from-final fantasies&quot;, summarizing it as &quot;aesthetically astonishing, rarely less than compelling, and near peerless in scope and execution&quot;. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; offered similar comments, stating that the game&#x27;s character development &quot;is the best of any RPGs&quot; and that &quot;&quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot; is the pinnacle of its genre&quot;.

Jeff Lundrigan reviewed the PlayStation version of the game for &quot;Next Generation&quot;, rating it four stars out of five. Francis Hwang of &quot;Spin&quot; magazine praised the &quot;brilliant-looking&quot; cinematic visuals, stating the cutscenes rival &quot;even the most major of major animated pictures&quot; and that the &quot;combat scenes are filled with the same dramatic poses and dazzling, 70 mm explosions seen in such classics as &quot;Akira&quot; and &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;&quot;.

Reviews of the gameplay have been mixed. &quot;IGN&quot; felt that it was the weakest aspect of the game, citing its Guardian Force attack sequences as &quot;incredibly cinematic&quot; but tedious, sentiments echoed by &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;. They also regarded the battle system as intensely complicated, yet refreshingly innovative and something that &quot;RPG fanatics love to obsess over&quot;. &quot;Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine&quot; claims that the game&#x27;s Junction system is a major flaw due to repetitive stocking of spells, while the video game magazine &quot;Edge&quot; commented that the battle system consists of a &quot;bewildering&quot; number of intricate options and techniques that &quot;most gamers will [...] relish&quot;. &quot;GameSpot&quot; praised the game&#x27;s battle system, commenting that the &quot;possibilities for customization [with the Junction system] are immense&quot;.

The PC port received mixed reception. &quot;Maximum PC&quot; praised the full motion video sequences as &quot;phenomenal&quot;, adding that while the gameplay took getting used to, they enjoyed the teamwork emphasized by it, and that the game&#x27;s visual presentation added to its appeal. &quot;GameSpy&quot; stated that while the game was not a &quot;huge leap forward&quot; from the previous title, its gameplay and visual appeal worked for its benefit, though that on a computer the pre-rendered backgrounds appeared blurry and the controls at time difficult with a keyboard. &quot;GameSpot&quot; criticized the game for not taking advantage of the capabilities afforded to computers at the time, describing the PlayStation version as both looking and sounding superior, and recommending that the title was &quot;not worth buying period&quot; for the PC. UGO.com also described the port as inferior to its original counterpart, adding that its presentation was in turn detrimental to the reception the game received as a whole. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; praised some of the changes made to the game in light of previous titles and the inclusion of the Triple Triad sub-game, though heavily criticized the port as &quot;lazy&quot; and &quot;disappointing&quot;, stating that it only served to emphasize the original game&#x27;s flaws. Despite their complaints, they named it the twentieth-best game of 2000.

At the 3rd Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences awarded &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot; with &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Animation&quot;, &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Art Direction&quot;, and &quot;Console Adventure/Role-Playing Game of the Year&quot;.

===Sales===
It was a best-seller in Japan. It had more than pre-orders prior to release. The game set a single-day sales record, selling copies and grossing or $151 million (equivalent to $ million in ) in its first day of release. It sold approximately 2.57 million units in Japan within the first four days of release. Within two days of its North American release on September 7, 1999, &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot; became the top-selling video game in the United States, a position it held for more than three weeks. It sold more than units and grossed more than $50 million (equivalent to $ million in North America during the 13 weeks that followed, making it the fastest-selling &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; title). It was also a best-seller in the UK. In Europe, it grossed €26,549,294 or in 1999, adding up to more than $228 million (equivalent to $ million) grossed in Japan, North America and Europe during 1999.

By the end of 1999, 6.08 million units were sold worldwide, including in Japan, in North America, and in Europe and other territories (including Australia, mainland East Asia, and Africa). Its sales had increased to units by early 2001. By March 2003, the game had shipped 8.15 million copies worldwide, including 3.7 in Japan and 4.45 abroad. By 2009, it had sold over 8.6 million copies on the PlayStation. According to Steam Spy, an estimated 703,000 digital copies of the PC version were sold on Steam by April 2018. By August 2019, worldwide sales were over 9.6 million units across all platforms.

===Retrospective===
The opening cut scene in &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot; was ranked second on &quot;Game Informer&quot;″s list of &quot;Top 10 Video Game Openings&quot;, and first by &quot;IGN&quot;. &quot;GameSpy&quot; listed it as the 15th-best cinematic moment in video games. &quot;IGN&quot; named the game&#x27;s ending the third best of any game for the PlayStation, while UGO.com named it one of the series&#x27; best and most memorable moments. &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot; was voted by readers of Japanese magazine &quot;Famitsu&quot; as the 22nd-best game of all time in 2006, and named one of the 20 essential Japanese role-playing games by &quot;Gamasutra&quot;, stating &quot;[t]here&#x27;s a lot that &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot; does wrong, but there&#x27;s even more that it does right&quot;.

UGO.com said that while no other game in the series had stirred the controversy that &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot; had and that while it was flawed, the title was a &quot;daring, groundbreaking game [...] decidedly the most original console-style RPG ever created&quot;. In 2002, &quot;IGN&quot; named it the seventh-best title for the PlayStation, placing higher on the list than &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;; the publication felt that &quot;VIII&quot; improved on the strengths of its predecessor. Kat Bailey, writing for &quot;1Up.com&quot;, noted &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot; as the first game in the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series which features a love story as the game&#x27;s overarching theme, calling it a daring choice and a symbol of the video game medium&#x27;s continued evolution as a form of storytelling, with numerous subsequent video games adopting romantic subplots to varying degrees of success. In 2024, Phil Salvador, library director of the Video Game History Foundation, created a new website &quot;ff8isthe.best&quot; dedicated to essays about the game.

<doc id="52758" wikidata="Q474573" url="?curid=52758" title="Final Fantasy IX">
<text>is a 2000 role-playing video game developed and published by Square for the PlayStation video game console. It is the ninth game in the main &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series. The plot focuses on a war between nations in a medieval fantasy world called Gaia. Players follow a thief named Zidane Tribal who kidnaps princess Garnet Til Alexandros XVII as part of a ploy by the neighboring nation of Lindblum. He joins Garnet and a growing cast of characters on a quest to take down her mother, Queen Brahne of Alexandria, who started the war.

Game development occurred in parallel with &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot;. Envisioned by developers as a retrospective for the series, it departed from the futuristic settings of &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;, &quot;VII&quot;, and &quot;VIII&quot; by returning to the medieval style of the earlier games. Consequently, it draws heavy influence from the original &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; and features allusions to the rest of the series. The game introduced new features to the series despite this approach, such as &quot;Active Time Event&quot; cutscenes, &quot;Mognet&quot;, and skill systems. &quot;Final Fantasy IX&quot; was the last game in the main series whose music was composed solely by Nobuo Uematsu.

&quot;Final Fantasy IX&quot; was released to critical acclaim and commercial success, selling more than 5.5 million copies on PlayStation by March 2016. It was re-released in 2010 as a PS1 Classic on the PlayStation Store—this version was compatible with PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable; PlayStation Vita support arrived in 2012. In 2016 Square Enix released an enhanced port featuring minor gameplay and graphical enhancements, which would be released on several platforms. An animated series adaptation by Square Enix and Cyber Group Studios was announced in 2021.

==Gameplay==

In &quot;Final Fantasy IX&quot;, the player navigates a character through the game world, exploring areas and interacting with non-player characters. Most of the game occurs on &quot;field screens&quot; consisting of pre-rendered backgrounds representing towns and dungeons. To aid exploration on the field screen, &quot;Final Fantasy IX&quot; introduces the &quot;field icon&quot;, an exclamation mark appearing over the lead character&#x27;s head, indicating a point of interest. Players speak with Moogles to record their progress, recover their energy, and purchase items. An extensive optional quest involves sending and receiving letters from Moogles and other non-playable characters via Mognet, an in-game postal service.

Players journey between field screen locations on the world map, a three-dimensional representation of &quot;Final Fantasy IX&quot;″s world presented from a top-down perspective. Players can freely navigate around the world map unless restricted by obstacles such as bodies of water or mountain ranges. To traverse these impediments, players can ride chocobos, sail on a boat, or pilot airships. Like previous &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games, players enter battles caused by random encounters with enemies while traveling across the world map or hostile field screens. &quot;Final Fantasy IX&quot; offers a new approach to town exploration with Active Time Events (ATE). These allow the player to view events unfolding at different locations, providing character development, unique items, and prompts for story-altering decisions. ATEs are occasionally used to simultaneously control two teams when the party divides to solve puzzles and navigate mazes.

===Combat and character progression===
When the player encounters an enemy, the map changes to a battle screen. The player issues commands to characters from an on-screen menu on the battle screen, including physically attacking, using items from the inventory, and unique character-specific abilities that define their role in battle. For example, the thief Zidane can steal items, Eiko and Garnet can summon &quot;eidolons&quot; to aid the party, and Vivi can use black magic to damage the opposition. The speed and order in which the characters and enemies take their turn varies according to their agility, an implementation of the Active Time Battle system first featured in &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot;. Character-specific commands change when the character goes into &quot;Trance mode&quot;, which is activated for a short duration when the character sustains a specified amount of damage similar to the Limit Breaks in &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;. Trance mode amplifies the character&#x27;s strength and allows the player to select more powerful attack commands. For example, Vivi&#x27;s &quot;Black Magic&quot; command changes into &quot;Double Black&quot;, allowing him to cast two magic spells at once. Winning battles awards money, items, &quot;experience points&quot;, and &quot;ability points&quot;.

Experience points determine a character&#x27;s combat attributes like agility, strength, and magical power. Accumulating sufficient experience points results in a &quot;level up&quot;, which permanently increases combat attributes. Equipment worn by a character may also amplify their attributes. Certain weapons and armor also bestow special abilities, which the character may use when equipped. When the character earns enough ability points, it becomes usable without the item equipped. There are two types of abilities: action and support. Action abilities require magic points to use and include magical spells and special moves used in battle. Support abilities provide functions that are automatically enabled in battle, such as increasing power against certain types of enemies. The maximum number of effects characters can equip at once is determined by each character&#x27;s Magic Stones.

==Plot==
===Setting and characters===

&quot;Final Fantasy IX&quot; takes place primarily in a world named Gaia. Most of Gaia&#x27;s population lives on the Mist Continent, named after the thick Mist that blankets the lowlands. Large mountain ranges act as natural borders that separate its four nations: Alexandria, Lindblum, Burmecia, and Cleyra. Alexandria is a warmongering monarchy that controls the eastern half of the continent. One of its cities is Treno, a cultural nexus under perpetual starlight that is home to many aristocrats and paupers alike. The technologically advanced Lindblum, a hub of airship travel, is nestled on a plateau to the southwest. Both countries feature a mix of humans, humanoids, and anthropomorphic animals. Burmecia, a kingdom showered by endless rain, is in the northwest. Cleyra, a neighboring settlement that seceded from Burmecia due to its appreciation for war, is situated in a giant tree in the desert, protected by a sandstorm. Both are inhabited by anthropomorphic rats with a fondness for dance and spear fighting.

Players eventually explore the Outer, Lost, and Forgotten Continents as well. Civilizations on the Outer Continent include Conde Petie, home of the dwarves; Black Mage Village, a secret settlement of sentient magician drones; and Madain Sari, once home to a near-extinct race of horned humanoid summoners who conjure powerful magical beings called eidolons. Also on the Outer Continent is the Iifa Tree, which disperses the Mist to other continents through its roots. This Mist stimulates the fighting instinct in humanoids and contributes to Gaia&#x27;s bloody history. The Lost and Forgotten continents are littered mostly with ancient ruins. Scattered throughout the marshes of Gaia are the Qu: large, frog-eating, and seemingly androgynous humanoids who are considered great gourmands. Late in the game, players briefly travel to the parallel world of Terra and the dream realm of Memoria.

The main playable characters are: Zidane Tribal, a member of a group of bandits called Tantalus who are masquerading as a theater troupe; Garnet Til Alexandros XVII (alias Dagger), the Princess of Alexandria who runs away with Zidane; Vivi Ornitier, a young, timid, and kind black mage with an unknown origin; Adelbert Steiner, a brash Alexandrian knight captain and loyal servant of Princess Garnet; Freya Crescent, a Burmecian dragoon searching for her lost love; Quina Quen, a Qu whose master wants them to travel the world so that they will learn about cuisine; Eiko Carol, a young girl living in Madain Sari who is one of the last summoners; and Amarant Coral, a bounty hunter hired to return Garnet to Alexandria. Other important characters include Cid Fabool, the charismatic Regent of Lindblum; Brahne, Garnet&#x27;s adoptive mother and the power-hungry Queen of Alexandria; Beatrix, the general of Alexandria&#x27;s all-female army; Garland, an elderly Terran male tasked with saving his world; and antagonist Kuja, an arms dealer and pawn of Garland who questions his own existence.

===Story===
In Alexandria, Zidane and Tantalus kidnap Princess Garnet by order of Cid. Garnet does not resist, for she was already planning to flee and warn Cid of Queen Brahne&#x27;s increasingly erratic behavior. Vivi and Steiner join the party during the escape. En route to Lindblum, the group discovers that Brahne is manufacturing soulless black mage soldiers that look similar to Vivi. In Lindblum, Cid confirms that he hired the group to protect Garnet from Brahne&#x27;s newfound aggression. After learning that Alexandria has invaded Burmecia with the black mages, Zidane and Vivi join Freya to investigate. Garnet and Steiner secretly return to Alexandria to reason with Brahne.

Zidane&#x27;s team finds that the Alexandrian forces, headed by Beatrix, conquered Burmecia with help from Kuja and the refugees have fled to Cleyra. Brahne imprisons Garnet, extracts her eidolons, and uses the eidolon, Odin to destroy Cleyra while Zidane&#x27;s group defends the city. The party escapes on Brahne&#x27;s airship, rendezvous with Steiner, and rescues Garnet. Meanwhile, Brahne cripples Lindblum with another eidolon, Atomos. Cid explains that Kuja supplies Brahne with black mages and the knowledge to use eidolons. The party befriends Quina and tracks Kuja to the Outer Continent. Brahne hires bounty hunters Lani and Amarant to capture Garnet. On the Outer Continent, the party defeats Lani and meets Eiko, a summoner who lives with a group of moogles in the village of Madain Sari. Eiko leads Zidane and the others to the Iifa Tree. Inside, they learn that Kuja uses Mist to create the black mages and that Vivi was a prototype. The party defeats the monster that generates the Mist within the Tree, which clears it from the Mist Continent. While waiting for Kuja&#x27;s reprisal at Madain Sari, Lani and Amarant attempt to kidnap Eiko but Zidane and the moogles foil them. Amarant then challenges Zidane to a duel and loses. He joins the party and Garnet learns of her heritage as a summoner who was adopted by Brahne as a child. At the Tree, Brahne attempts to kill Kuja with an eidolon so she can rule unopposed, but he takes control of it and destroys her and her army.

After Garnet&#x27;s coronation, Kuja attacks Alexandria Castle. Garnet and Eiko summon an extremely powerful eidolon in defense; Kuja attempts to steal the eidolon as a means to kill his master, Garland, but the latter arrives and destroys it. The party chases Kuja through a portal to Terra, where the antagonists&#x27; goals become clear. The Terrans created Garland to merge their dying world with Gaia; Garland, in turn, created self-aware, soulless vessels called Genomes. For millennia, Garland has been using the Iifa Tree to replace deceased Gaian souls with the hibernating Terran souls, turning the former into Mist in the process; this will allow the Terrans to be reborn into the Genomes after the planetary merge. Kuja and Zidane are Genomes created to accelerate this process by bringing war and chaos to Gaia. Kuja had betrayed Garland to avoid becoming occupied by a Terran soul. Kuja defeats Garland, who reveals before dying that the former has a limited lifespan anyhow: Garland designed Zidane to be his replacement. Enraged, Kuja destroys Terra and escapes to the Iifa Tree.

At the Iifa Tree, the party enters Memoria and reaches the origin of the universe: the Crystal World. They defeat Kuja, preventing him from destroying the original crystal of life and thus the universe. After defeating Necron, a force of death, the Tree collapses; the party flees, while Zidane stays behind to rescue Kuja. One year later, the game reveals the cast&#x27;s fate: Tantalus arrives in Alexandria to put on a show; Vivi has implicitly died as Black Mages only live for a year, but he has left behind several identical &quot;sons,&quot; as well as grown to understand the meaning of life; Freya and Fratley are rebuilding Burmecia; Cid has adopted Eiko; Quina works in the castle&#x27;s kitchen; Amarant and Lani are travelling together; and Garnet presides as queen of Alexandria, with Steiner and Beatrix as her guards. In the climax of Tantalus&#x27;s performance, the lead actor reveals himself as Zidane in disguise and reunites with Queen Garnet.

==Development==
Early planning for &quot;Final Fantasy IX&quot; began in July 1998 before Square had finished development on &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot;. The game was developed in Hawaii as a compromise to developers living in the United States. As the series&#x27; last game on the PlayStation, Sakaguchi envisioned a &quot;reflection&quot; on the older games of the series. Leading up to its release, Sakaguchi called &quot;Final Fantasy IX&quot; his favorite &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; game as &quot;it&#x27;s closest to [his] ideal view of what &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; should be&quot;. This shift was also a response to demands from fans and other developers. Additionally, the team wanted to create a coherent story with deep character development; this led to the creation of Active Time Events which showcase the character&#x27;s individual exploration away from the protagonist. Sakaguchi wrote the scenario for the game, with further contributions from Kazuhiko Aoki and Nobuaki Komoto.
In the game&#x27;s conceptual stage, the developers made it clear that the title would not necessarily be &quot;Final Fantasy IX&quot;, as its break from the realism of &quot;VII&quot; and &quot;VIII&quot; may have alienated audiences. This idea led fans to speculate that it would be a &quot;gaiden&quot; (side story) to the main series. By late 1999, however, Square had confirmed that the game would indeed be titled &quot;Final Fantasy IX&quot;, and by early 2000, they had almost finished the game. The developers made several adjustments to the game, such as changing the ending seven times. Director Hiroyuki Ito had designed the battle system.

The game&#x27;s developers sought to make the game&#x27;s environment more &quot;fantasy-oriented&quot; than its PlayStation predecessors by reintroducing a medieval setting. In the game world, steam technology is just beginning to become widely available. The population relies on hydropower or wind power for energy sources but sometimes harness Mist or steam to drive more advanced engines. Norse and Northern European mythology also inspired the game&#x27;s setting. According to Ito, &quot;[the development team is] attracted to European history and mythology because of its depth and its drama&quot;. The game&#x27;s art director was Hideo Minaba, while the characters were designed by Shūkō Murase and Toshiyuki Itahana. Recurring artist Yoshitaka Amano created promotional concept art of the characters and world, and designed the logo. The main &quot;Final Fantasy IX&quot; website says the development of the game&#x27;s world serves as a culmination of the series by blending the &quot;successful elements of the past, such as a return to the fantasy roots&quot;, with newer elements. To accomplish this and satisfy fans who had become used to the realistic designs of &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot;, the designers stressed creating characters with whom the player could easily relate. The characters had &quot;comic-like looks&quot; as a result. In addition, &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot; was used as inspiration for the design of the world and characters. Ito suggested that the protagonist Zidane should be flirtatious towards women.

===Music===

Regular series composer Nobuo Uematsu wrote the music of &quot;Final Fantasy IX&quot;. In early discussions about the game, Ito asked him to compose themes for the eight main characters along with &quot;an exciting battle track, a gloomy, danger-evoking piece, and around ten other tracks&quot;. Uematsu spent a year composing and producing &quot;around 160&quot; pieces, with 140 appearing in the game. During writing sessions, Square gave him a travel break in Europe for inspiration, where he spent time admiring ancient architecture in places like Germany. Uematsu cited medieval music as a significant influence on the score of &quot;IX&quot;. He aimed for a &quot;simple&quot; and &quot;warm&quot; atmosphere and incorporated uncommon instruments like the kazoo and dulcimer. Unlike the stark realism of its predecessors, the high fantasy undertones of &quot;IX&quot; allowed for a broader spectrum of musical styles and moods. Uematsu composed with a piano and used two contrasting methods: &quot;I create music that fits the events in the game, but sometimes, the [developers] will adjust a game event to fit the music I&#x27;ve already written&quot;.

Uematsu incorporated several motifs from older &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games into the score, such as the original battle music intro, a reworked &quot;Volcano Theme&quot; from &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; and the Pandemonium theme in &quot;Final Fantasy II&quot;. Tantalus&#x27; band plays &quot;Rufus&#x27; Welcoming Ceremony&quot; from &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; near the beginning of the game. Uematsu has stated on several occasions that &quot;Final Fantasy IX&quot; is his favorite score. &quot;Melodies of Life&quot; is the theme song of &quot;IX&quot; and shares its main melody with pieces frequently used in the game itself, such as the overworld theme and a lullaby that Garnet sings. Emiko Shiratori performed this piece in both the Japanese and English versions with arrangement by Shirō Hamaguchi.

==Release==
&quot;Final Fantasy IX&quot;″s release was delayed to avoid a simultaneous release with then-rival Enix&#x27;s &quot;Dragon Quest VII&quot;. On October 7, 2000, a demo day for the North American version of &quot;IX&quot; was held at the Metreon in San Francisco, California. The first American release of the game was also at the Metreon; limited-edition merchandise was included with the game and fans cosplayed as &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; characters in celebration of the release. In Canada, a production error left copies of &quot;Final Fantasy IX&quot; without an English version of the instruction manual, prompting Square to ship copies of the English manual to Canadian stores several days later. Square heavily promoted the game both before and after its release. Starting on March 6, 2000, the game&#x27;s characters appeared in a line of computer-generated Coca-Cola commercials. Figurines of several characters were also used as prizes in Coca-Cola&#x27;s marketing campaign. That same year, &quot;IGN&quot; awarded &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; dolls and figurines for prizes in several of their contests.

&quot;Final Fantasy IX&quot; was released on Sony&#x27;s Greatest Hits on June 30, 2003.

&quot;Final Fantasy IX&quot; was also the benchmark of Square&#x27;s interactive PlayOnline service. PlayOnline was initially developed to interface with &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; but became a strategy site for &quot;IX&quot; when those plans fell through. Square designed the website to complement BradyGames&#x27; and Piggyback Interactive&#x27;s official strategy guides for the game, where players who bought the print guide had access to &quot;keywords&quot; that they could search for on PlayOnline&#x27;s site for extra tips and information. This design caused anger among buyers of the guide who felt cheated by the expensive print version&#x27;s omissions. The blunder made &quot;GameSpy&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Top 5 Dumbest Moments in Gaming&quot; list, and Square dropped the idea for &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;, which was under development at the time.

Square Enix re-released the game as part of the &quot;Final Fantasy 25th Anniversary Ultimate Box&quot; Japanese package in December 2012. A remastered version was released for Android and iOS in February 2016.&lt;ref name=&quot;iOS/Android&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The remaster features HD movies and character models, an auto-save feature, seven different game boosters (cheats), including high speed and no encounter modes, and achievements. A port for Windows was released on April 14 the same year. In September 2017, the Windows port was released on PlayStation 4. It was also released on the Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, and Windows 10 in North America on February 13, 2019, and in other regions a day later.

==Reception==
&quot;Final Fantasy IX&quot; sold over 2.65 million copies in Japan by the end of 2000, making it the second-highest selling game of the year in the region. Although it was a top-seller in Japan and America, &quot;Final Fantasy IX&quot; did not sell as many copies as &quot;VII&quot; or &quot;VIII&quot; in either Japan or the United States. In 2001, the game received a &quot;Gold&quot; certification from the Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland (VUD), for sales of at least 100,000 units across Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. The original PlayStation version sold over 5.5 million copies by March 2016.

&quot;Final Fantasy IX&quot; was released to critical acclaim both in Japan and abroad. It achieved a 94/100 on the review aggregator Metacritic making it their highest-scoring &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; game. The game was voted the 24th-best game of all time by readers of the Japanese magazine &quot;Famitsu&quot;. Francesca Reyes of &quot;Next Generation&quot; called it &quot;an imaginative return to the roots of the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series that hits the RPG mark dead-on&quot;.

Critics generally praised the title&#x27;s gameplay and combat system. &quot;GameSpot&quot; approved of the simple learning curve and that the ability system is not as complex as in &quot;VII&quot; or &quot;VIII&quot;. Each character possesses unique abilities, which prevents one character from overpowering the others. &quot;GameSpot&quot; describes the battle system as having a tactical nature and notes that the expanded party allows for more interaction between players and between enemies. Nevertheless, &quot;IGN&quot; disliked the lengthy combat pace and the repeated battles, describing it as &quot;aggravating&quot;. &quot;RPGFan&quot; felt the Trance system was ineffective because the meter buildup is slow and unpredictable, with characters Trancing just before the enemy dies.

The characters and graphics also received positive reviews. Although &quot;IGN&quot; felt that the characters were similar to those in other &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games, the characters were still engaging and sympathetic. &quot;GameSpot&quot; found the characters amusing and full of humor. &quot;IGN&quot; also noted that even the Active Time Event system helps expand the player&#x27;s understanding of the characters&#x27; personalities as they grapple with many ideas and emotions. &quot;RPGFan&quot; enjoyed the detailed animation and design of the semi-deformed graphical style. They also praised the pre-rendered backgrounds, noting the careful attention given to the artwork, movement in animations, and character interactivity. They commended the cutscenes for being emotionally compelling and highlighted the seamless transition between cutscenes and in-game graphics. The music also received praise, with &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; listing it the best soundtrack on their list of top five original soundtracks, while &quot;GamePro&quot; praised the audio for evoking &quot;emotions throughout the story, from battles to heartbreak to comedy&quot;.

Critics acknowledged that Square primarily built the storyline upon elements found in previous &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; installments, such as evil empires and enigmatic villains. The main villain, although considered by &quot;GameSpot&quot; to be the least threatening in the series, was seen by &quot;IGN&quot; as an impeccable combination of &quot;Kefka&#x27;s cackling villainy&quot; and &quot;plenty of the bishonenosity that made Sephiroth such a hit with the ladies&quot;. &quot;RPGFan&quot; felt that the music was &quot;uninspired and dull&quot; compared to previous &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; titles and criticized composer Uematsu for reusing some tracks from past iterations of the series. Still, reviewers have concluded that this and many other elements are part of the overall effort to create a nostalgic game for fans of the older &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games.

The strategy guide also received criticism; it urged buyers to log onto an online site to gain the information instead of providing it within the actual guide. The book&#x27;s given links are no longer accessible on the PlayOnline website. The minigame &quot;Tetra Master&quot; was seen by &quot;GameSpot&quot; as inferior and confusing compared to &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot;″s minigame &quot;Triple Triad&quot; as the rules are vaguely explained and offered few rewards despite its expansive nature.

During the 4th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences honored &quot;Final Fantasy IX&quot; with the &quot;Console Role-Playing&quot;, &quot;Art Direction&quot; and &quot;Animation&quot; awards, as well as received nominations for &quot;Game of the Year&quot;, &quot;Console Game of the Year&quot;, &quot;Original Musical Composition&quot;, and &quot;Character or Story Development&quot;.

===Legacy===
&quot;Final Fantasy IX&quot; was voted the 4th best &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; game in a poll by Japan&#x27;s national broadcasting organization NHK. &quot;IGN&quot; named it the 14th best game on the original PlayStation, calling it an &quot;incredible&quot; way to close out the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series&#x27;s first nine games and complimented its reverence for those titles. &quot;Rock Paper Shotgun&quot; named the title their 4th best &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; game available on PC, praising the cast and its eclectic group of heroes. Though overshadowed during its initial release by other &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; titles, the game has been recognized for its mature themes, including mortality and handling death and is considered a JRPG masterpiece. The music has also been called one of Uematsu&#x27;s greatest scores. The game has inspired a number of mods such as &quot;Moguri Mod&quot;, which is an unofficial remaster project developed by fans which saw its initial release in 2018.

In 2015, OverClocked ReMix released a four-disc collection called &quot;Worlds Apart&quot; with 120 songs to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the game&#x27;s release. In June 2021, Cyber Group Studios and Square Enix announced plans to develop an animated television series based on &quot;Final Fantasy IX&quot;.

<doc id="52759" wikidata="Q223381" url="?curid=52759" title="Final Fantasy X">
<text>is a 2001 role-playing video game developed and published by Square for PlayStation 2. The tenth main installment in the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series, it is the first game in the series to feature fully three-dimensional areas (though some areas were still pre-rendered), and voice acting. &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; replaces the Active Time Battle (ATB) system with the &quot;Conditional Turn-Based Battle&quot; (CTB) system, and uses a new leveling system called the &quot;Sphere Grid&quot;.

Set in the fantasy world of Spira, a setting influenced by the South Pacific, Thailand and Japan, the game&#x27;s story revolves around a group of adventurers and their quest to defeat a rampaging monster known as Sin. The player character is Tidus, a star athlete in the fictional sport of blitzball, who finds himself in Spira after Sin attacked his home city of Zanarkand. Shortly after arriving to Spira, Tidus becomes a guardian to summoner Yuna to destroy Sin upon learning its true identity is that of his missing father, Jecht.

Development of &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; began in 1999, with a budget of more than ( in dollars) and a team of more than 100 people. The game was the first in the main series not entirely scored by Nobuo Uematsu; Masashi Hamauzu and Junya Nakano were signed as Uematsu&#x27;s fellow composers. &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; was both a critical and commercial success, shipping over 8.5 million units worldwide on PlayStation 2. It is considered to be one of the greatest video games ever made. It was followed by &quot;Final Fantasy X-2&quot; in March 2003, making it the first &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; game to have a direct game sequel. As of September 2021, the &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; series had sold over 20.8 million units worldwide, and at the end of March 2022 had surpassed 21.1 million. A remaster, &quot;Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster&quot; was released for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita in 2013, for PlayStation 4 in 2015, Windows in 2016, and for Nintendo Switch and Xbox One in 2019.

==Gameplay==
Like previous games in the series, &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; is presented in a third-person perspective, with players directly navigating the main character, Tidus, around the world to interact with objects and people. Unlike previous games, however, the world and town maps have been fully integrated, with terrain outside of cities rendered to scale. As Tidus explores the world, he randomly encounters enemies. When an enemy is encountered, the environment switches to a turn-based battle area where characters and enemies await their turn to attack.

The gameplay of &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; differs from that of previous &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games in its lack of a top-down perspective world map. Earlier games featured a miniature representation of the expansive areas between towns and other distinct locations, used for long-distance traveling. In the game, almost all the locations are essentially continuous and never fade out to a world map. Regional connections are mostly linear, forming a single path through the game&#x27;s locations, though an airship becomes available late in the game, giving the player the ability to navigate Spira faster. Like previous games in the series, &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; features numerous minigames, including the underwater sport blitzball.

===Combat===
&quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; introduces the Conditional Turn-Based Battle (CTB) system in place of the series&#x27; traditional Active Time Battle (ATB) system first used in &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot;. Whereas the ATB concept features real-time elements, the CTB system is a turn-based format that pauses the battle during each of the player&#x27;s turns. Thus, the CTB design allows the player to select an action without time pressure. A graphical timeline along the upper-right side of the screen details who will be receiving turns next, and how various actions taken will affect the subsequent order of turns. The ordering of turns can be affected by a number of spells, items, and abilities that inflict status effects upon the controlled characters or the enemies. The player can control up to three characters in battle, though a swapping system allows the player to replace them with a character outside the active party at any time. &quot;Limit Breaks&quot;, highly damaging special attacks, reappear in &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; as &quot;Overdrives&quot;. In this incarnation of the feature, most of the techniques are interactive, requiring button inputs to increase their effectiveness. While initially the Overdrives can be used when the character receives a significant amount of damage, the player is able to modify the requirements to unlock them.

&quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; overhauled the summoning system employed in previous games of the series. Whereas in previous titles a summoned creature would arrive, perform one action, and then depart, the &quot;Aeons&quot; in &quot;X&quot; arrive and replace the battle party, fighting in their place until either the aeon wins the battle, is defeated itself, or is dismissed by the player. Aeons have their own statistics, commands, special attacks, spells, and Overdrives. The player acquires five aeons over the course of the game through the completion of Cloister of Trials puzzles; three additional aeons can be obtained by completing various side-quests.

===Sphere Grid===
As with previous titles in the series, players can develop and improve their characters by defeating enemies and acquiring items, though the traditional experience point system is replaced by a new system called the &quot;Sphere Grid&quot;. Instead of characters gaining pre-determined statistic bonuses for their attributes after leveling up, each character gains &quot;Sphere Levels&quot; after collecting enough Ability Points (AP). Sphere Levels allow players to move around the Sphere Grid, a pre-determined grid of interconnected nodes consisting of various statistic and ability bonuses. &quot;Spheres&quot; are applied to these nodes, unlocking its function for the selected character.

The Sphere Grid system allows players to fully customize characters in contrast to their intended battle roles, such as turning the White Mage-roled Yuna into a physical powerhouse and the swordsman Auron into a healer. The &quot;International&quot; and PAL versions of the game include an optional &quot;Expert&quot; version of the Sphere Grid; in these versions, all of the characters start in the middle of the grid and may follow whichever path the player chooses. As a trade-off, the Expert grid has fewer nodes in total, thus decreasing the total statistic upgrades available during the game.

=== Blitzball ===

Blitzball is a minigame that requires strategy and tactics. The underwater sport is played in a large, hovering sphere of water surrounded by a larger audience of onlookers. The player controls one character at a time as they swim through the sphere performing passes, tackles, and attempts to score. The gameplay is similar to that of the main game in the way that the controlled character moves through the area until they encounter an enemy. In this case, the enemy is a member of the opposing team. Status effects are also implemented in the minigame as each player can learn techniques that are equivalent to abilities in the main game.

Blitzball is introduced in the beginning of the game during one of the early cinematic sequences in which Tidus, the main character who is described as a star blitzball player, is part of an intense game. It is the only minigame that plays a role in the overall plot line as it is a main part of Tidus&#x27;s character, and is in the first scene where the game&#x27;s main antagonist, Sin is shown. Unlike with the other minigames, playing blitzball is mandatory near the beginning of the game, but it is later optional.

==Plot==
===Setting and characters===

&quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; is set in the fictional world of Spira, consisting of one large landmass divided into three subcontinents, surrounded by small tropical islands. It features diverse climates, ranging from the tropical Besaid and Kilika islands, to the temperate Mi&#x27;ihen region, to the frigid Macalania and Mt. Gagazet areas. Spira is very different from the mainly European-style worlds found in previous &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games, being much more closely modeled on Southeast Asia, most notably with respect to vegetation, topography, architecture, and names.

Spira features a variety of races, though predominantly populated by humans. Among them are the Al Bhed, a technologically advanced but disenfranchised sub-group of humans with distinctive green eyes and unique language. The Guado, which are less human in appearance, with elongated fingers and other arboreal features. Still less human are the lion-like Ronso and the frog-like Hypello. A subset of Spira&#x27;s sentient races are the &quot;unsent&quot;, the strong-willed spirits of the dead that remain in corporeal form. In Spira, the dead who are not sent to the Farplane by a summoner come to envy the living and transform into &quot;fiends&quot;, the monsters that are encountered throughout the game; however, unsent with strong attachments to the world of the living may retain their human form. Other fauna in Spira, aside from those drawn from real animals, such as cats, dogs, birds, and butterflies, include the gigantic, amphibious shoopufs (which are similar to elephants); and the emu-like chocobo, which appears in most &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games.

There are seven main playable characters in &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;, starting with Tidus (James Arnold Taylor/Masakazu Morita), a cheerful young teenager and a star blitzball player from Zanarkand, who seeks a way home after an encounter with Sin transported him to Spira. To do so, he joins Yuna (Hedy Burress/Mayuko Aoki), a summoner on a journey to obtain the Final Aeon and defeat the enormous whale-like &quot;Sin&quot;. Journeying with them are: Kimahri Ronso (John DiMaggio/Katsumi Chō), a young warrior of the Ronso tribe who watched over Yuna during her childhood; Wakka (also DiMaggio/Kazuya Nakai), a blitzball player whose younger brother was killed by Sin; and Lulu (Paula Tiso/Rio Natsuki), a stoic black mage close to Yuna and Wakka. During the journey, they are joined by Auron (Matt McKenzie/Hideo Ishikawa), a former warrior monk, who worked with both Tidus&#x27; and Yuna&#x27;s fathers to defeat Sin 10 years prior; and Rikku (Tara Strong/Marika Matsumoto), Yuna&#x27;s cousin, a perky Al Bhed girl and the first friendly person Tidus meets upon arriving in Spira.

===Story===
Tidus waits with his allies outside the ruins of an ancient city. He narrates the events that led to the present, spanning most of the game&#x27;s storyline. It begins in his home city, the high-tech metropolis of Zanarkand, where he is a renowned blitzball player and son of the famous blitzball star Jecht, an abusive father who disappeared 10 years prior. During a blitzball tournament, the city is attacked by an immense creature that Auron, a man not originally from Zanarkand, calls &quot;Sin&quot;. Sin destroys Zanarkand and takes Tidus and Auron to the world of Spira. Upon arriving in Spira, Tidus is rescued by Al Bhed salvagers, with the young Rikku explaining that Sin destroyed Zanarkand 1,000 years ago. After Sin attacks again, Tidus is separated from the divers and drifts to the tropical island of Besaid, where he meets Wakka, captain of the local blitzball team. Wakka introduces Tidus to Yuna, a young summoner about to go on a pilgrimage to obtain the Final Aeon and defeat Sin with her guardians Lulu, a mage of black magic, and Kimahri, a member of the Ronso tribe. The party travels across Spira to gather aeons, defending against attacks by Sin and its &quot;offspring&quot; called Sinspawn. Tidus meets Auron again, who convinces Tidus to become Yuna&#x27;s guardian upon revealing that Jecht is Sin&#x27;s true identity. Ten years ago, Auron and Jecht bodyguarded Yuna&#x27;s late father Braska to defeat Sin but Jecht became a new Sin. As Yuna&#x27;s party continues their pilgrimage, Tidus reunites with Rikku, who the party learns is Yuna&#x27;s cousin.

When the party arrives in the city of Guadosalam, the leader of the Guado and major clergy member Seymour Guado, proposes to Yuna, saying that it will ease Spira&#x27;s sorrow. At Macalania Temple, the group discovers a message from the spirit of Seymour&#x27;s father, Lord Jyscal; he declares that he was killed by his own son, who now aims to destroy Spira. The group reunites with Yuna and kills Seymour in battle; soon afterward, Sin attacks, separating Yuna and sending the others to the arid Bikanel Island. While searching for Yuna at the island&#x27;s Al Bhed settlement, Tidus has an emotional breakdown when he learns that summoners die after summoning the Final Aeon, leading to his desire to find a way to defeat Sin while keeping Yuna alive. The group finds Yuna in Bevelle, the center of the clergy’s power, where she is being forced to marry the unsent Seymour. They crash the wedding, after which Seymour reveals his plan to become Sin with Yuna&#x27;s help. The party defeats him a second time and escapes with Yuna. The group heads toward the ruins of Zanarkand, seen in the introduction of the game.

Shortly before arriving, Tidus learns that he, Jecht, and the Zanarkand they hail from are summoned entities akin to aeons based on the original Zanarkand and its people. Long ago, the original Zanarkand battled Bevelle in a machina war, in which the former was defeated. Zanarkand&#x27;s survivors became &quot;fayth&quot; so that they could use their memories of Zanarkand to create a new city in their image, removed from the reality of Spira. Once they reach Zanarkand, Yunalesca—the first summoner to defeat Sin and unsent ever since—tells the group that the Final Aeon is created from the fayth of one close to the summoner. After defeating Sin, the Final Aeon kills the summoner and transforms into a new Sin, which has caused its cycle of rebirth to continue. The group decides against using the Final Aeon, due to the futile sacrifices it carries and the fact that Sin would still be reborn. Yunalesca tries to kill Tidus&#x27; group, but she is defeated and vanishes, ending hope of ever attaining the Final Aeon.

After the fight, the group learns that Yu Yevon — the deity of the Yevon religion who was a summoner from Zanarkand before losing his humanity and mind — is behind Sin&#x27;s cycle of rebirth. This leads the group to infiltrate Sin&#x27;s body in order to find Yu Yevon. Inside Sin, the party finds the unsent Seymour, who had been absorbed by Sin and intends to control it from within. Yuna defeats him for the final time before sending him to the Farplane. Shortly after, the group reaches the core of Sin and finds Jecht&#x27;s imprisoned spirit. Tidus and Jecht come to terms with the latter&#x27;s abuse. Jecht transforms into his Final Aeon form, asking the party to defeat him and end the cycle; they do so. With Sin&#x27;s host defeated, Yuna summons and the group defeats each aeon after Yu Yevon possesses each one until finally they vanquish Yu Yevon himself.

Sin&#x27;s cycle of rebirth ends when Yuna sends Sin and the Aeons to the farplane, and the spirits of Spira&#x27;s fayth are freed from their imprisonment. Auron, who had been revealed to be unsent, is sent to the Farplane. Dream Zanarkand and Tidus disappear, now that the freed fayth stopped the summoning. Afterward, in a speech to the citizens of Spira, Yuna resolves to help rebuild their world now that it is free of Sin and gives a speech remembering all those that have been lost. In a post-credits scene, Tidus awakens under water and swims towards the ocean surface reaching towards the light.

==Development==
&quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;″s development began in 1999, costing approximately ¥4 billion (approximately , or in dollars) with a crew of over 100 people, most of whom worked on previous games in the series. Executive producer Hironobu Sakaguchi has stated that although he had concerns about the transition from 2D to 3D backgrounds, the voice acting, and the transition to real-time story-telling, the success of the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series can be attributed to constantly challenging the development team to try new things. Producer Yoshinori Kitase was also the chief director of &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;, while the direction of events, maps and battles was split up between Motomu Toriyama, Takayoshi Nakazato and Toshiro Tsuchida, respectively. The development of the script for the game took three to four months, with the same amount of time dedicated to the voice recording afterwards. Tetsuya Nomura and Kazushige Nojima collaborated with Daisuke Watanabe, Toriyama and Kitase on writing the scenario for &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;. Nojima was particularly concerned with establishing a connection in the relationship between player and main character. Thus, he penned the story such that the player&#x27;s progress through the world and growing knowledge about it is reflected in Tidus&#x27; own understanding and narration.

According to the Square Enix companion book &quot;Final Fantasy Ultimania Archive Volume III&quot;, &quot;17 SEVEN TEEN&quot; was a temporary title early in &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;″s production. &quot;17 SEVEN TEEN&quot;″s story differed from the final version: the protagonist, who looked similar to Tidus, traveled the world seeking a cure for a pandemic that killed people when they reached the age of seventeen. This inevitable death motif was later carried over to Yuna&#x27;s fate as a summoner.

===Influences===
Character designer Tetsuya Nomura has identified the South Pacific, Thailand and Japan as major influences on the cultural and geographic design of Spira, particularly concerning the geographic location of the southern Besaid and Kilika islands. He has also said that Spira deviates from the worlds of past &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games in the level of detail incorporated, something he has expressed to have made a conscious effort to maintain during the design process. Kitase felt that if the setting went back to a medieval European fantasy, it would not seem to help the development team advance. While he was thinking of different world environments, Nojima suggested a fantasy world that incorporated Asian elements.

Sub-character chief designer Fumi Nakashima&#x27;s focus was to ensure that characters from different regions and cultures bore distinctive characteristics in their clothing styles, so that they could be quickly and easily identified as members of their respective sub-groups. For example, she has said that the masks and goggles of the Al Bhed give the group a &quot;strange and eccentric&quot; appearance, while the attire of the Ronso lend to them being able to easily engage in battle. Tidus was originally envisioned to be a plumber as to connect to the underwater elements used in the game, according to Nojima, but they later made him into a blitzball athlete, helping to distinguish his character from prior &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; protagonists; Tidus&#x27; final outfit still incorporated elements of the original plumber outfit they had designed for him.

Tidus&#x27; relationship with his father Jecht was based on &quot;stories throughout the ages, such as the ancient Greek legends&quot;. This would eventually reveal the key of Sin&#x27;s weakness and eventual defeat. Auron was intended to be silent throughout the game but became a voiced character as they developed out the Guardian storyline between Tidus and Yuna. Although &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; was originally centered on the relationship between Tidus and Yuna, the addition of Jecht&#x27;s character and his feud with his son was added later in the making of the game to provide more focus on how the father and son produce a bigger impact in Spira&#x27;s history rather than the romantic couple. Kitase found the story between Tidus and Jecht to be more moving than the story between Tidus and Yuna.

===Design===

&quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; features innovations in the rendering of characters&#x27; facial expressions, achieved through motion capture and skeletal animation technology. This technology allowed animators to create realistic lip movements, which were then programmed to match the speech of the game&#x27;s voice actors.

The cutscene of Tidus and Yuna kissing was developed by Visual Works, a subsidiary of Square Enix. Many of the animators were not experienced with romance scenes - Visual Works director Kazuyuki Ikumori said that the animators sought feedback from younger staff at Square Enix, as well as female members of staff. The scene was remade multiple times after receiving responses that earlier drafts were &quot;unnatural&quot; and &quot;not believable&quot;.

Nojima has revealed that the inclusion of voice acting enabled him to express emotion more powerfully than before, and he was therefore able to keep the storyline simple. He also said that the presence of voice actors led him to make various changes to the script, in order to match the voice actors&#x27; personalities with the characters they were portraying. The inclusion of voice, however, led to difficulties. With the game&#x27;s cutscenes already programmed around the Japanese voice work, the English localization team faced the difficulty of establishing English-oriented dialogue and the obstacle of incorporating this modified wording with the rhythm and timing of the characters&#x27; lip movements. Localization specialist Alexander O. Smith noted that they had to keep the localized sound file within the duration of the original Japanese, as longer files would cause the game to crash. He described the process of fitting natural-sounding English speech into the game as &quot;something akin to writing four or five movies&#x27; worth of dialogue entirely in haiku form [and] of course the actors had to act, and act well, within those restraints&quot;.

The game was initially going to feature online elements, offered through Square&#x27;s PlayOnline service. The features were dropped during production, and online gaming would not become part of the series until &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot;. Map director Nakazato wanted to implement a world map concept with a more realistic approach than that of the traditional &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; game, in line with the realism of the game&#x27;s 3D backgrounds, as opposed to pre-rendered backgrounds. Battle art director Shintaro Takai has explained that it was his intention that battles in &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; come across as a natural part of the story and not an independent element. Features would have included wandering enemies visible on the field map, seamless transitions into battles, and the option for players to move around the landscape during enemy encounters. However, hardware limitations resulted in these ideas not being used. Instead, a compromise was made, whereby some transitions from the field map to the battle map were made relatively seamless with the implementation of a motion blur effect that would happen at the end of an event scene. The desire for seamless transitions also led to the implementation of the new summoning system seen in the game.

As a player of the games in the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series, battle director Tsuchida wanted to recreate elements he found interesting or entertaining, which eventually led to the removal of the &quot;Active Time Battle&quot; system, and instead, incorporated the strategy-focused &quot;Conditional Turn-Based Battle&quot; system. Kitase has explained that the purpose behind the Sphere Grid is to give players an interactive means of increasing their characters&#x27; attributes, such that they will be able to observe the development of those attributes firsthand. At the time of the game&#x27;s development, Nojiima had been reading about cryptography, and thus created the means to decode the Al Bhed language within the game, albeit simpler than initially planned.

===Music===

&quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; marks the first time regular series composer Nobuo Uematsu has had any assistance in composing the score for a game in the main series. His fellow composers for &quot;X&quot; were Masashi Hamauzu and Junya Nakano. They were chosen for the soundtrack based on their ability to create music that was different from Uematsu&#x27;s style while still being able to work together. PlayOnline.com first revealed that the game&#x27;s theme song was completed in November 2000. As Square still had not revealed who would sing the song, GameSpot personally asked Uematsu, who jokingly answered that it was going to be Rod Stewart.

The game features three songs with vocalized elements, including the J-pop ballad &quot;Suteki da ne&quot;, which translates to &quot;Isn&#x27;t it Wonderful?&quot;. The lyrics were written by Kazushige Nojima, and the music was written by Uematsu. The song is performed by Japanese folk singer Rikki, whom the music team contacted while searching for a singer whose music reflected an Okinawan atmosphere. &quot;Suteki da ne&quot; is also sung in Japanese in the English version of &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;. Like &quot;Eyes on Me&quot; from &quot;VIII&quot; and &quot;Melodies of Life&quot; from &quot;IX&quot;, an orchestrated version of &quot;Suteki da ne&quot; is used as part of the ending theme. The other songs with lyrics are the heavy metal opening theme, &quot;Otherworld&quot;, sung in English by Bill Muir; and &quot;Hymn of the Fayth&quot;, a recurring piece sung using Japanese syllabary.

The original soundtrack spanned 91 tracks on four discs. It was first released in Japan on August 1, 2001, by DigiCube, and was re-released on May 10, 2004, by Square Enix. In 2002, Tokyopop released a version of &quot;Final Fantasy X Original Soundtrack&quot; in North America entitled &quot;Final Fantasy X Official Soundtrack&quot;, which contained 17 tracks from the original album on a single disc. Other related CDs include &quot;feel/Go dream: Yuna &amp; Tidus&quot; which, released in Japan by DigiCube on October 11, 2001, featured tracks based on Tidus&#x27; and Yuna&#x27;s characters. &quot;Piano Collections Final Fantasy X&quot;, another collection of music from the game, and &quot;Final Fantasy X Vocal Collection&quot;, a compilations of exclusive character dialogues and songs were both released in Japan in 2002.

The Black Mages, a band led by Nobuo Uematsu that arranges music from &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; video games into a rock music style, have arranged three pieces from &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;. These are &quot;Fight With Seymour&quot; from their self-titled album, published in 2003, and &quot;Otherworld&quot; and &quot;The Skies Above&quot;, both of which can be found on the album &quot;The Skies Above&quot;, published in 2004. Uematsu continues to perform certain pieces in his &quot;Dear Friends: Music from Final Fantasy&quot; concert series. The music of &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; has also appeared in various official concerts and live albums, such as &quot;20020220 Music from Final Fantasy&quot;, a live recording of an orchestra performing music from the series including several pieces from the game. An odd note is that the unreleased/promo CD-R (Instrumental) version of Madonna&#x27;s &quot;What It Feels Like For A Girl&quot; done by Tracy Young was used in the blitzball sequences. Additionally, &quot;Swing de Chocobo&quot; was performed by the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra for the &quot;Distant Worlds – Music from Final Fantasy&quot; concert tour, while &quot;Zanarkand&quot; was performed by the New Japan Philharmonic Orchestra in the &quot;Tour de Japon: Music from Final Fantasy&quot; concert series. Independent but officially licensed releases of &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; music have been composed by such groups as Project Majestic Mix, which focuses on arranging video game music.

==Reception==

&quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; received critical acclaim from video game critics. The Japanese video game magazine &quot;Famitsu&quot; and &quot;Famitsu PS2&quot; awarded the game a near-perfect 39/40 score. Another Japanese gaming magazine, &quot;The Play Station&quot;, gave the game a score of 29/30. &quot;Famitsu&quot;, &quot;Famitsu PS2&quot;, and &quot;The Play Station&quot; expressed particularly favorable responses toward the game&#x27;s storyline, graphics, and movies. The game maintains a 92 out of 100 on Metacritic. Producer Shinji Hashimoto said that the overall reception to the game was &quot;excellent&quot;, having received praise and awards from critics.

&quot;IGN&quot;″s David Smith offered praise for the voice actors and the innovations in gameplay, particularly with the revised battle and summon systems, the option to change party members during battle, and the character development and inventory management systems. He also felt that the game&#x27;s graphics had improved on its predecessors in every way possible, and that the game as a whole was &quot;the best-looking game of the series [and] arguably the best-playing as well&quot;. Greg Kasavin of &quot;GameSpot&quot; praised the game&#x27;s storyline, calling it surprisingly complex, its ending satisfying, and its avoidance of role-playing game clichés commendable with Tidus viewed as an appealing protagonist. He also lauded the music, feeling it was &quot;diverse and well suited to the various scenes in the game&quot;. Similarly, &quot;GamePro&quot; described its character building system and battle system as &quot;two of the best innovations in the series&quot;. The visuals of the game were commended by GameSpy&#x27;s Raymond Padilla, who referred to them as &quot;top-notch&quot;, as well as giving praise to the character models, backgrounds, cutscenes, and animations. The voice casting was praised by Game Revolution who noted most of them were &quot;above average&quot; and called the music &quot;rich&quot;.

&quot;Edge&quot; rated the game considerably lower, criticizing many aspects of the game for being tedious and uninnovative and describing the dialogue as &quot;nauseating&quot;, particularly panning Tidus. Andrew Reiner of &quot;Game Informer&quot; criticized the game&#x27;s linearity and that players were no longer able to travel the world by chocobo or control the airship. &quot;Eurogamer&quot;″s Tom Bramwell noted that the game&#x27;s puzzle segments were &quot;depressing&quot; and &quot;superfluous&quot;, and that although the Sphere Grid was &quot;a nice touch&quot;, it took up too much of the game. The linearity of the game was positively commented on by &quot;GamePro&quot; who stated that a player would not be required to participate in side-quests or the mini-game to reach the game&#x27;s conclusion, finding some of them unappealing. Game Revolution complained that cutscenes could not be skipped, some even being too long.

===Sales===
Square initially expected the game to sell at least two million copies worldwide owing to the reduced PlayStation 2&#x27;s fanbase, making it smaller than the last three released titles. However, within its first day of its release in Japan, more than units were shipped, including 1.4 to 1.5 million pre-orders. A million units were sold within hours, and first-day shipments were expected to generate or in sales revenue. These figures exceeded the performances of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; and &quot;IX&quot; in a comparable period, and &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; became the first PlayStation 2 game to reach two and four million sold copies. In October 2007, the game was listed as the 8th best-selling game for the PlayStation 2. &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; sold over copies in Japan alone in 2001.

By July 2006, it had sold 2.3 million copies and earned $95 million in the United States ( in ). &quot;Next Generation&quot; ranked it as the 11th highest-selling game launched for the PlayStation 2, Xbox or GameCube between January 2000 and July 2006 in that country. As of March 2013, the game had shipped over 8.5 million copies worldwide on PS2. As of 2017, the PS2 version of the game has sold over 8 million copies worldwide.

===Awards===
&quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; received the Best Game Award from the Japan Game Awards for 2001–02. In &quot;GameSpot&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Best and Worst Awards&quot; from 2001, it came seventh in the category &quot;Top 10 Video Games of the Year&quot;, and won the &quot;Best Story&quot; and &quot;Best Role-Playing Game&quot; awards. The game also received a PlayStation 2 Game of the Year award nomination at the 2002 Golden Joystick Awards, but lost to &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot;. Readers of &quot;Famitsu&quot; magazine voted it the best game of all time in early 2006. &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; came in fifth on &quot;IGN&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Top 25 PS2 Games of All Time&quot; list in 2007 and sixth in &quot;The Top 10 Best Looking PS2 Games of All Time&quot;. In a similar list by GameSpy, the game took the 21st place. &quot;1UP.com&quot; listed its revelation during the ending as the third-biggest video game spoiler, while &quot;IGN&quot; ranked the ending as the fifth best pre-rendered cutscene. In a Reader&#x27;s Choice made in 2006 by &quot;IGN&quot;, it ranked as the 60th-best video game. It was also named one of the 20 essential Japanese role-playing games by Gamasutra. It also placed 43rd in &quot;Game Informer&quot;″s list of &quot;The Top 200 Games of All Time&quot;. In 2004, &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; was listed as one of the best games ever made by GameFAQs, while in November 2005 it was voted as the 12th &quot;Best Game Ever&quot;. In a general overview of the series, both &quot;GamesRadar&quot; and &quot;IGN&quot; listed &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; as the fourth best game. At the 6th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards in 2003, it was nominated for &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Animation&quot; and &quot;Console Role-Playing Game of the Year&quot;. Readers from GameFaqs also voted it as Game of the Year during 2001. In 2008, readers of &quot;Dengeki&quot; magazine voted it the second best game ever made. It was voted first place in &quot;Famitsu&quot;″s and &quot;Dengeki&quot;″s polls of most tear-inducing games of all time. Both Tidus and Yuna have been popular characters in games in general due to their personalities and their romantic relationship.

==Legacy==

Due to its commercial and critical success, Square Enix released a direct sequel to &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; in 2003, titled &quot;Final Fantasy X-2&quot;. The sequel is set two years after the conclusion of &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;, establishing new conflicts and dilemmas and resolving loose ends left by the original game. Although the sequel did not sell as well as the original, 5.4 million units versus over 8 million units, it can still be considered a commercial success. As a result of the title&#x27;s popularity, Yoshinori Kitase and Kazushige Nojima decided to establish a plot-related connection between &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, another well-received&quot; Final Fantasy&quot; game. In 2013, after the release of the &quot;HD Remaster&quot;, Nojima said that he would like to see a second sequel to &quot;X&quot;, and if there were demand for it, it could happen. The minigame of blitzball has made it into other games, such as its sequel, and was mentioned as a possibility for &quot;Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn&quot;.

The advancements in portraying realistic emotions achieved with &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; through voice-overs and detailed facial expressions have since become a staple of the series, with &quot;X-2&quot; and other subsequent titles (such as &quot;Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII&quot;, &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot;, &quot;XIII&quot; and its sequels, and &quot;XV&quot;) also featuring this development. Traversing real-time 3D environments instead of an overworld map has also become a standard of the series. &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; can be considered a pioneer in 3-D RPG maps. The Sphere Grid system of &quot;FFX&quot; had an influence on the action role-playing game &quot;Path of Exile&quot; (2013), along with the Materia system of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;.

According to Square Enix producer Shinji Hashimoto, cosplays of the characters have been popular. Takeo Kujiraoka, director of &quot;Dissidia Final Fantasy NT&quot;, regarded &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; as his favorite game from the franchise based on its emotional impact on the players as well as the multiple amount of playable content that surpasses 100 hours. Kujiraoka noted that the staff received multiple requests by fans to include Tidus&#x27; and Yuna&#x27;s &quot;Will&quot; look as an alternative design but Nomura said it was not possible as the company would first need to develop &quot;Final Fantasy X-3&quot;.

In addition, a kabuki stage adaptation of the game&#x27;s story, &quot;Kinoshita Group presents New Kabuki Final Fantasy X&quot;, a collaboration between Square Enix and Tokyo Broadcasting System, was performed at the IHI Stage Around Tokyo from March 4 to April 12, 2023 with a cast including Kikunosuke Onoe as Tidus and Yonekichi Nakamura as Yuna.

<text>Final Fantasy Chronicles is a compilation of Square&#x27;s role-playing video games &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot; (1991) and &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; (1995), released for the North American Sony PlayStation on July 2, 2001. TOSE ported both titles from the Super Nintendo Entertainment System; each had been previously released as individual Japanese PlayStation ports in 1997 (&quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot;) and 1999 (&quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;). Several bonus features were added to each game, such as art galleries, bestiaries, and cutscenes—including computer-generated imagery full motion video used at the beginning of &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot; and anime scenes used throughout &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;.

&quot;Final Fantasy Chronicles&quot; was received well by players and critics, who praised the peripheral features and the fact that Square was offering RPG classics to a new generation of gamers. Conversely, reviewers sharply criticized &quot;long and frequent loading&quot; between areas and battles due to poor emulation. Enough copies of &quot;Chronicles&quot; were sold to warrant a second release as part of Sony&#x27;s Greatest Hits in June 2003.

==Gameplay==
In &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot; and &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;, the player controls a set of characters, closely following the role-playing video game genre. The methods of viewing and controlling the characters are separated by three different &quot;screens&quot;: the overworld, where the characters traverse to different locations; the field map, where the characters explore locations such as towns and dungeons; and the battle screen, where the characters fight with monsters or other enemies.

===&quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot;===

&quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot; introduced the Active Time Battle, a system designed by Hiroyuki Ito. It centers around the player inputting orders for the characters in &quot;real time&quot; during battles. Each character is balanced through certain strengths and weaknesses; for instance, a strong magic user may have low defense, while a physical fighter may have low agility.

===&quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;===

&quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;″s gameplay deviates from traditional role-playing games in that, rather than random encounters, most enemies are openly visible on field maps or lie in wait to ambush the party. Contact with enemies on a field map initiates a battle that occurs directly on the field map itself rather than on a separate battle screen. &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; uses an updated form of the Active Time Battle introduced in &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot;, with additions such as &quot;Techs&quot; that rely on enemy positioning and abilities of characters. Other features are the employment of time travel and a &quot;New Game Plus&quot; option.

==Development==
&quot;Final Fantasy Chronicles&quot; features two previously released ports by TOSE; &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot; and &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; were released separately, and &quot;IV&quot; was re-released as a part of &quot;Final Fantasy Collection&quot;, all published in Japan. &quot;Chronicles&quot; was designed and directed by Kazuhiko Aoki, supervised by Fumiaki Fukaya, and produced by Akihiro Imai. It was created as a follow-up to &quot;Final Fantasy Anthology&quot;, a compilation of &quot;Final Fantasy V&quot; and &quot;VI&quot;.

The original &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot; was released in North America as &quot;Final Fantasy II&quot; in 1991, with various &quot;Easytype&quot; modifications. These were removed in the &quot;Final Fantasy Chronicles&quot; version, and the game was re-localized, achieving a script closer Takashi Tokita&#x27;s original scenario. &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;, released in 1995, was already localized by Ted Woolsey, but the &quot;Final Fantasy Chronicles&quot; version has additional modifications.

A primary addition to both games is full-motion video. &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot; features computer animated cutscene sequences, while &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; features anime-style sequences designed by Akira Toriyama and animated by Toei Animation that &quot;help further tell the story of Chrono Trigger&quot;. &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot; was given gameplay features such as a two-player mode, a &quot;Sprint Feature&quot; to &quot;enhance and quicken gameplay&quot;, and the &quot;Memo File&quot; system to &quot;reduce saving time&quot;. &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;, instead of added gameplay features, has an &quot;Extras Mode&quot;. This features databases such as a bestiary and a gallery of artwork created in development.

===Promotion and merchandising===

A compilation of &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot; and &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; was in consideration in December 2000, with &quot;Final Fantasy Anthology&quot;″s success a key decision factor. &quot;Final Fantasy Chronicles&quot; was announced by Square Electronic Arts in April 2001. President Jun Iwasaki mentioned an &quot;overwhelming number&quot; of requests to re-release &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;, and believed the compilation of it and &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot; would &quot;appeal to fans of the original games and introduce a new generation of gamers to some of our classic titles&quot;. An event was held on July 10 in San Francisco, primarily to celebrate the film &quot;Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within&quot; and release of &quot;Final Fantasy Chronicles&quot;. It featured a cosplay contest, a memorabilia raffle, and booths to play &quot;Final Fantasy Chronicles&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;.

&quot;Music from Final Fantasy Chronicles&quot; is a set of two separately released compact discs published by TokyoPop. &quot;Final Fantasy IV Official Soundtrack&quot; and &quot;Chrono Trigger Original Soundtrack&quot; were both released on August 21, 2001. &quot;Final Fantasy IV Official Soundtrack&quot; is nearly the same release as &quot;Final Fantasy IV: Original Sound Version&quot;, the soundtrack album for the original game, except that the songs were rerecorded by TOSE, resulting in minor differences, some song titles were slightly changed, and a 45th track was added, &quot;Theme of Love (Arranged)&quot;, which had previously only been released as a piano version on the second track of &quot;Piano Collections Final Fantasy IV&quot;. This release has the catalog number TPCD 0210–2, and its 45 tracks had a length of 62 minutes. &quot;Chrono Trigger Original Soundtrack&quot; was the corresponding album for &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;. The album was heavily based on &quot;Chrono Trigger Original Soundtrack&quot;, the soundtrack album for the PlayStation release of &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;; the first 21 tracks of the album out of 25 were identical to &quot;Chrono Trigger Original Soundtrack&quot;, while the next three tracks corresponded to tracks 22, 23, and 29 of the &quot;Original Soundtrack&quot; and the final track was the same as the first track of &quot;Brink of Time&quot;, an arranged album of &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; music. The album is 1:13:03 long, and has a catalog number of TPCD 0209–2. In addition to the albums, a strategy guide for &quot;Final Fantasy Chronicles&quot; written by Dan Birlew and was published by BradyGames on July 2, 2001.

==Reception==
&quot;Final Fantasy Chronicles&quot; was commercially and critically successful, becoming the top selling PlayStation title for two weeks, and scoring an average of 89 out of 100 in Metacritic&#x27;s aggregate, a review tallying website. Gaming website IGN rated it 9.4 and awarded an &quot;Editor&#x27;s Choice Award&quot;, calling the game a &quot;must buy&quot; for RPG fans. It was a runner-up for &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s annual &quot;Best PlayStation Game&quot; award, which went to &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 3&quot;.

GameSpot reviewer Brad Shoemaker gave the game an 8.5, but cited &quot;muffled sound effects&quot; in &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot;, and was displeased with frequent loading in &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;. He added that the visuals were &quot;stupendous&quot; when the games were originally released, but they now look dated and will &quot;turn off those looking for a bigger thrill for their gaming dollar&quot;. Marcus Lai of Gaming Age was disappointed with a lack of additions, calling the ports &quot;barebone games&quot; and claiming that the full motion videos are &quot;nice touches to both games but don&#x27;t add much&quot;.

<text>Final Fantasy Mystic Quest, released as Mystic Quest Legend in PAL regions and as in Japan, is a role-playing video game for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It was released as a spin-off to Square&#x27;s &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series of video games. &quot;Final Fantasy Mystic Quest&quot; was first released in North America in 1992 and marketed as a &quot;simplified role-playing game... designed for the entry-level player&quot; in an attempt to broaden the genre&#x27;s appeal. The game&#x27;s presentation and battle system is broadly similar to that of the main series, but differs in its inclusion of action-adventure game elements. It was also the first &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; game to be released in Europe.

The player controls a youth named Benjamin in his quest to save the world. His goal is to reclaim a set of stolen crystals that determine the state of the world&#x27;s four elemental powers. The gameplay takes a departure from the main series in a variety of ways, eliminating many series staples such as random battles, save points, manual equipment, and the party system. The game received middling reviews and sales in North America and Japan, citing its simplified gameplay and lack of depth in the game&#x27;s story. It has retained its reputation for being a &quot;beginner&#x27;s &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;&quot; and has been praised for its music.

==Gameplay==
===Exploration===
Like previous games in the series, &quot;Final Fantasy Mystic Quest&quot; is presented in a top-down perspective, with players directly navigating the main character around the world to interact with objects and people. The game features a unique way of traveling the world map. Unlike past &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games, players cannot freely roam the world map. Instead, they travel along set paths from one &quot;icon&quot; (pictorial image on the world map) to the next. Some routes are blocked off (restriction is indicated by a gray arrow), but become accessible when the player succeeds in a specific task, such as completing a dungeon. Once its path is open, the player can enter an icon; the game&#x27;s plot and action takes place within these icons, which include towns, dungeons, and battlefields. The game is characterized by featuring action-adventure game elements; besides jumping, players can use weapons outside of battle, which play an active role in exploration. Players can chop down trees with an axe, detonate bombs to open sealed doorways, or use a grappling hook to clear wide gaps. The game has more puzzles than earlier &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games. In the Falls Basin, for example, players must move pillars of ice across the ground level in such a fashion that they can be used as platforms to jump across on the second level. &quot;Mystic Quest&quot; does away with save points; players can save their progress at any time during exploration.

===Battle system===

&quot;Final Fantasy Mystic Quest&quot; eliminates the system of random enemy encounters, a trademark of the main series. Instead, battles are represented in dungeons as stationary enemy sprites, and the player is given the option of approaching the enemy and engaging a battle. Once engaged in battle, the player is thrust into the battle screen, which presents a window-based menu with three commands to choose from: battle, run, or control. Running from battle transports the player back to the field screen, while choosing &quot;control&quot; toggles between the ally&#x27;s battle mode, where the player can manually control the main character&#x27;s ally or opt for a computer-controlled ally. If players choose to battle, they are presented with a submenu of four more options: physically attack the enemy, cast a spell, use a curative item (such as a Cure potion), or defend. The game&#x27;s battle system relies on conditional turn-based combat, where the characters and enemies cycle through rounds in battling each other, with the first action of the turn awarded to the fastest character. Enemy sprites are always far larger than player sprites in battle, despite appearing further away from the game camera. Some animals attack by physically crushing the players.

Character health is represented by an incremental life bar, although the player may choose to have it displayed in numerical fractions as in most role-playing games. If all character life bars reach zero, the game is over, but the player is given the option of continuing and restarting the battle. If the player chooses this option, however, the main character&#x27;s attack power may suffer temporarily as a penalty. A character&#x27;s performance in battle is determined by numerical figures (called statistics) for vitality, attacking power, defensive capabilities, speed, magical prowess, accuracy, and evasion. Character statistics are driven by experience points (EXP) gained from winning battles, which accumulate until players achieve milestones known as &quot;experience levels&quot;. Besides awarding experience points, battling enemies also earns the player gold pieces (GP), which can be used to buy weapons, armor, and curative items. In the absence of random enemy encounters, battlefields are scattered across the world map. Players are immediately thrust into a battle when entering a battlefield, and must win ten enemy battles to &quot;clean out&quot; the battlefield. Once a battlefield is cleaned out, players are awarded either a large amount of experience, a large amount of GP, a piece of armor, or a magic spell.

===Customization===

Unlike all other &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games, players cannot manually equip characters with armor. Instead, newly acquired armor replaces the main character&#x27;s current equipment, or upgrades a current version of a weapon, e.g. obtaining the knight sword will replace the steel sword. Using the L and R buttons allows the user to cycle through the weapons that have been collected so far. Benjamin uses four types of weapons: swords, axes, bombs, and claws. Although the weapons share a similar function in battle, all have different purposes when exploring the field map. The Dragon Claw, for example, doubles as a grappling hook. The weapon arsenal in &quot;Final Fantasy Mystic Quest&quot; is considerably smaller than most role-playing games.

Magic in &quot;Mystic Quest&quot; is not learned by designated spellcasters through experience. Instead, the main character acquires magic spells through treasure chests or as a reward for clearing out battlefields. The system of spellcasting is similar to that of the original &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;; rather than using magic points to draw upon for supplying magic, spells are used according to a set number for their type, i.e., white magic, black magic, or wizard magic. The allotted number for each type increases as a character levels up. A spell&#x27;s effectiveness is proportional to a character&#x27;s experience level; the higher the character&#x27;s level, the more powerful the Fire spell, for example. The spell catalog in &quot;Mystic Quest&quot; is limited compared to most other &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games. Items in the game are analogous to the spells. Notably, the Heal spell and potion act as a cure-all for status ailments, eliminating the need for unique status recovery items. Similarly, the Cure spell and potion each restore 25% of player&#x27;s maximum hit points regardless of level, so there is no need for a range of potion or spell strengths.

==Plot==
===Setting===
&quot;Final Fantasy Mystic Quest&quot; takes place on a single continent of an unnamed world, which is divided into four distinct regions: Foresta, Aquaria, Fireburg, and Windia. The welfare of each region is determined by the state of one of four shining crystals: earth, water, fire, and wind, respectively. For centuries the Focus Tower had stood at the heart of the world. It had been a center for trade and knowledge, and the world&#x27;s people met there to peacefully settle their differences. But on one warm summer day, powerful monsters stormed the Tower, stole the four crystals, and took off with the magical coins that kept the Tower&#x27;s doors unlocked. The monsters began consuming the power of the crystals; they grew in strength while the world began to decay. An old prophecy tells that at the time the &quot;vile four&quot; steal the power and divide the world behind four doors, a knight will appear to vanquish the darkness.

===Story===
The game opens with an adventurous youth named Benjamin climbing the Hill of Destiny. While exploring, his village is destroyed in an earthquake. As Benjamin is climbing the Hill, he meets a mysterious old man who charges Benjamin with fulfilling the knight&#x27;s prophecy. Although initially in disbelief, Benjamin accepts the role and the Old Man shows him the Focus Tower, supposedly the center of the World. After defeating a monster at the top of the hill, Benjamin follows the Old Man to the Level Forest, where he is tasked with recovering the Crystal of Earth. Proceeding to Foresta, he meets with an axe-wielding girl named Kaeli, who agrees to help Benjamin if he can help her rid the Level Forest of monsters. Kaeli is ambushed and poisoned in the process, and her mother informs Benjamin of the Elixir and where it can be found. Benjamin&#x27;s search for Elixir to heal Kaeli brings him to Bone Dungeon, where he&#x27;s aided by a treasure hunter named Tristam in succeeding dual purposes: not only does Benjamin get Elixir from Tristam to heal Kaeli, but he defeats one of the four Vile Evils, Flamerous Rex, to free the Crystal of Earth and in turn restore life to the dying village of Foresta. Tristam leaves and Benjamin heals Kaeli.

Benjamin is told that Aquaria is in danger, and is in need of help. He is told by the Old Man and various others that he should see Spencer. He is told that a girl named Phoebe can help him as well. After proceeding through the first stage of the Focus Tower, and arriving in the province of Aquaria, Benjamin locates Phoebe, and learns that Spencer is trapped underground by thick ice floes. Phoebe needs the &quot;wakewater&quot;, which is said to be able to help free Aquaria. Benjamin and Phoebe head to the Wintry Cave and defeat a monster to obtain the Libra Crest. Using this crest to enter Life Temple from the Libra Temple, they find that the source of the &quot;wakewater&quot; has dried up. Finding the Old Man in the back of the Life Temple, they find that he holds the only bag of wakewater, and to use it on the plant in the center of town. Back in Aquaria, they find that the wakewater does not work, and reviving the crystal is the only thing that will save the town and Spencer. They head off for the Ice Pyramid and defeat the second of the Vile Evils, the Ice Golem. The Water Crystal is saved, and Benjamin and Phoebe head back to Aquaria. They find the town is now like Foresta after the crystal is revived there and Spencer is back and digging his tunnel to save Kaeli&#x27;s father Captain Mac. Upon leaving, Spencer hands the Venus Key to Benjamin, and tells him to head for Fireburg.

Benjamin arrives in the Focus Tower to find the Old Man again, who tells him to find Reuben, and disappears. Benjamin heads for Fireburg, and finds Reuben. Reuben joins when Benjamin promises to help free Reuben&#x27;s dad, Arion. Upon finding Tristam in the Inn who gives Benjamin the Multi-Key, they find the coward who left Arion in the mine in a locked house. He teaches Benjamin how to throw the bombs and says that it will free Arion. Benjamin and Reuben then proceed to the Mine and free Arion. Arion tells some tales of how the Fire Crystal has gone berserk, and Reuben goes off with Benjamin to the Volcano to stop the Vile Evil from stealing the crystal&#x27;s power. After defeating the Dualhead Hydra, Benjamin and Reuben find the Fire Crystal returning to power. They decide to head to Windia, and Reuben is ambushed by monsters and falls off the rope bridge. Tristam comes along and helps Benjamin cross the bridge, but they are stymied by a tree who won&#x27;t talk to them. Tristam says that there is a gal in Foresta who can talk to tree spirits, and the two drop in on Aquaria where Kaeli was trying to find Spencer. Benjamin and Tristam go down into the tunnel and find Spencer, who tells Tristam of a great treasure. They leave, and Phoebe plants a bomb that collapses a tunnel Spencer was building. She leaves to tell Spencer what happened, and Benjamin takes Kaeli to the Alive Forest to talk to the dormant tree spirit. He tells them that he will take them to Windia if they kill the monsters dwelling within him. They do and he takes them to Windia.

Upon arriving in Windia, Benjamin and Kaeli find Otto, whose daughter Norma was caught in Pazuzu&#x27;s Tower when the winds from nearby Mount Gale knocked out his Rainbow Road. The only way the road works is when there is no wind, so Benjamin and Kaeli proceed to Mount Gale and stop the wind by defeating a powerful monster at the top. After returning to Windia, Otto powers up the Rainbow Road and the two adventurers proceed to Pazuzu&#x27;s Tower. After giving chase, they corner Pazuzu and defeat the fourth Vile Evil and restore the Wind Crystal. Norma is reunited with Otto, and Kaeli stays to take care of her. Reuben shows up and after a series of long events Captain Mac is rescued. Reuben falls down because of the injury sustained on the Rope Bridge, and Phoebe joins Benjamin instead.

The Old Man tells Benjamin an ominous addendum to the prophecy: &quot;The one behind the four is darker than the night, and rises midst the land&quot;. It becomes known that the Dark King is the true source of evil. Benjamin thus sails to Doom Castle to confront the Dark King, who threatens to enslave Benjamin along with the rest of mankind. The Dark King claims that he wrote and spread the prophecy Benjamin had followed throughout his quest. Once the Dark King is defeated, the old man congratulates Benjamin and reveals that he is the Crystal of Light in the guise of a human. At the end of the game, Benjamin is seen still craving adventure, and he borrows the ship from Captain Mac as his friends gather to wish him off. While sailing, Tristam makes a surprise appearance.

==Development==
Although designed by one of Square&#x27;s development teams in Japan, &quot;Final Fantasy Mystic Quest&quot; was specifically geared for the U.S. market. At the time, console role-playing games were not a major genre in North America; Square thus attempted to broaden the genre&#x27;s appeal through this title. Square had already released several &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; spin-offs in North America, including the first three titles in the &quot;SaGa&quot; series as &quot;Final Fantasy Legend&quot;, and the first &quot;Mana&quot; series game as &quot;Final Fantasy Adventure&quot;, and wished to further break into the popular American consciousness. Square&#x27;s executives cited the alleged difficulty of role-playing games as the reason Americans shied away from them, and eased the difficulty level by tweaking various aspects of the main series&#x27; gameplay. The American release of &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot; was altered to make the game simpler, for example. &quot;Mystic Quest&quot; was to take this one step further, and the Japanese developers worked with the American offices to make sure the game was accessible to children.

&quot;Mystic Quest&quot; was developed in a graphic and gameplay style similar to &quot;Final Fantasy Legend III&quot; (part of the aforementioned &quot;SaGa&quot; series). The gameplay shares numerous similarities with that title, featuring a very similar battle system, graphical interface, and dungeon system. Even the jump feature from &quot;Final Fantasy Legend III&quot; has been reproduced, and almost all of the icons - from caves to the enemy sprites - are a color-upgraded version of &quot;Final Fantasy Legend III&quot;″s character set. Besides allowing for computer-controlled allies, the game did away with random battles, complicated storylines, and text-based menus. To appeal to the perceived tastes of North American audiences, which gravitated towards fast-paced games, Square included action-adventure game elements; players could now brandish weapons outside of battle, jump, use a grappling hook, and set bombs to open new paths. North American translator Ted Woolsey explained that &quot;the action/adventure players... are larger in numbers and the demographic is different. They tend to be younger and like the idea of jumping straight into the action with a sword in their hands; it&#x27;s an empowerment issue - you get to go out there, start whacking things and it feels good! With the more traditional RPGs, it takes a good 15 or 20 hours of playing before you&#x27;re finally hooked&quot;. Woolsey said that &quot;Mystic Quest&quot; was one of the easiest games he had to translate, due to the game&#x27;s small size. Because the game was marketed towards a younger demographic, the game sold for US$39.99.

===Release===
After its U.S. debut, &quot;Final Fantasy Mystic Quest&quot; was released in Japan under the title &quot;Final Fantasy USA: Mystic Quest&quot;. The European release of the game was released in English, German and French. The European release had its title changed to &quot;Mystic Quest Legend&quot; to avoid confusion with &quot;Final Fantasy Adventure&quot;, which had been released in Europe as &quot;Mystic Quest&quot;. &quot;Final Fantasy Mystic Quest&quot; was first unveiled in June at the 1992 Summer Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago, where it was a popular venue, and the game was later presented in more detail in the Fall 1992 issue of the &quot;Ogopogo Examiner&quot;.

===Audio===
The game&#x27;s soundtrack was composed by Ryuji Sasai and Yasuhiro Kawakami. It was one of the first games bearing the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; name not to be composed by series regular Nobuo Uematsu, after &quot;Final Fantasy Adventure&quot; (known in Japan as &quot;Seiken Densetsu: Final Fantasy Gaiden&quot;) and the &quot;Final Fantasy Legend&quot; trilogy (known in Japan as the &quot;Sa·Ga&quot; trilogy). The album was first released on one compact disc by NTT Publishing on September 10, 1993. ROM capacity limits and hardware limitations made the composition process difficult. After the game was completed, Sasai recorded two remixes on his days off for the game&#x27;s album, and personally played the guitar parts. &quot;Mountain Range of Whirlwinds&quot; was built off of Sasai&#x27;s liking of the sound of the french horn, and its ability to go the length of the song and convey a sense of mountains. The track &quot;Last Castle&quot; was written in a short time, and was used to create imagery of a field, but its length left very little space for the &quot;Battle 3&quot; song.&#x27;

==Reception==
According to Square&#x27;s publicity department, &quot;Final Fantasy Mystic Quest&quot; sold a total of 800,000 units, with roughly half of these sold in Japan.

On its original North American release, it scored 16/20 in &quot;GamePro&quot;, 14.9/20 in the November 1992 issue of &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;, 29/40 in &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;, and 86% in &quot;Electronic Games&quot;. The game did not generate much excitement in either America or Japan, although it is thought to have appealed to younger fans. The game ultimately failed in its bid to bring mainstream North American popularity to console RPGs, and simultaneously alienated fans of the series anticipating another epic following &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot;. &quot;Electronic Games&quot; described the title as &quot;&quot;Final Fantasy&quot; with an identity crisis&quot; due to the inherent flaw of creating a game that didn&#x27;t appeal to the masses or the hard-core gaming audience.

Reviews written in the years after its initial release remained largely negative. After the Wii Virtual Console release, &quot;Kotaku&quot; dubbed it &quot;The Worst Final Fantasy&quot; in the title of the review, and &quot;GamesRadar&quot; called it a &quot;franchise embarrassment&quot; for its enemies that stand still and wait for players to attack. &quot;IGN&quot; rated the Wii Virtual Console release a 6.0, or &quot;Okay&quot;, citing an extremely repetitive and simple battle system, and very little character development. &quot;1UP.com&quot; rated the game a &quot;Not Worth It!&quot;, calling it &quot;handholding&quot; and &quot;insubstantial&quot;.

It was, however, praised for its music, including &quot;1UP.com&quot; praising its &quot;sweet sampled metal guitar licks&quot;, and listed the final boss battle music as one of the must download songs for the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; music game &quot;Theatrhythm Final Fantasy&quot;. It was also praised by &quot;GamesRadar&quot; for its music, mentioning the boss battle in their &quot;Game Music of the Day&quot; column, and also mentioning the rest of the game music as smooth and easy listening. On April 1, 2006, &quot;GameSpot&quot; included &quot;Mystic Quest&quot; in an April&#x27;s Fools list entitled &quot;Top 10 Final Fantasy Games&quot;, which mostly consisted of spin-offs from the main series and unrelated games. &quot;Mystic Quest&quot; was &quot;praised&quot; for being easy and having simplistic graphics and plot. In October 2010, the game was released on Nintendo&#x27;s Virtual Console. &quot;Famitsu&quot; has also reported that Square was preparing the game for release on the Android mobile platform in 2012. In 2018, Complex ranked the game 66th on their &quot;The Best Super Nintendo Games of All Time&quot;. They liked the game being a simple more laid back &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; game and also liked the game music.

The main character Benjamin and several songs have appeared in &quot;Theatrhythm Final Fantasy: Curtain Call&quot; and &quot;Theatrhythm Final Bar Line&quot;.

<text>The Final Fantasy Legend, originally released in Japan as is a role-playing video game developed and published by Square for the Game Boy. It was originally released in Japan in December 1989 and North America in September 1990. It is the first game in the &quot;SaGa&quot; series and the first role-playing video game for the system. Square translated the game into English for worldwide release and renamed it, linking it with the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series to improve marketing. Sunsoft re-released it in North America during 1998; Square followed with a Japan-exclusive remake released for the WonderSwan Color and mobile phones in 2002 and 2007 respectively, it was also ported to the Nintendo Switch in 2020 and later ported to Android, iOS and Microsoft Windows in 2021.

&quot;The Final Fantasy Legend&quot; operates on a turn-based system similar to that of &quot;Final Fantasy II&quot;. The game&#x27;s characters battle monsters and fiends using a variety of weapons, armor, and skills that develop through the player&#x27;s actions. The game follows the story of four heroes who attempt to scale a tower at the center of the world that supposedly leads to paradise. The four heroes may belong to one of three character classes, each housing a unique customization path.

&quot;The Final Fantasy Legend&quot; was conceived by Nobuyuki Hoshino and developed under director Akitoshi Kawazu; renowned composer Nobuo Uematsu wrote its score. The game is Square&#x27;s first million seller with 1.37 million units shipped. Though released to mixed reception, it has since been described as one of the Game Boy&#x27;s greatest games and cited as an influence for series such as the &quot;Pokémon&quot; franchise.

==Gameplay==

In &quot;The Final Fantasy Legend&quot;, the player navigates a character throughout the game world with a party of up to four characters, exploring areas and interacting with non-player characters. Most of the game occurs in towns, castles, caves, and similar areas. To aid exploration on the field screen, the game makes use of various signs within towns. The player is initially limited to the World of Continent to explore, and given access to later worlds as his or her party climbs the Tower. Players can save their game anytime and anywhere when not in combat to a save slot for later play.

Players can journey between field screen locations via the world map, a downsized representation of &quot;Final Fantasy Legend&quot;″s various worlds. Players can freely navigate around the world map screen unless restricted by terrain, such as water or mountains. The goal in each world is to find the entrance to the next level of the Tower. Random enemy encounters occasionally interrupt travel across the world map screen and hostile areas, as in other &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; related games.

===Classes===
At the beginning of the game, the player must choose a character class, gender, and name for the group&#x27;s &quot;party leader&quot;. There are three available classes: &quot;humans&quot;, &quot;mutants&quot; (&quot;espers&quot; in the Japanese version), and &quot;monsters&quot;, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Character classes cannot be changed once the game has begun. The player may recruit up to three additional party members through a similar process via &quot;Member Guilds&quot; in various towns. Characters may also be recruited to replace fallen party members, though the party leader is irreplaceable. Higher-level party members may be recruited at later towns in the game.

A character&#x27;s performance in battle is determined by numerical values (&quot;statistics&quot;) for four categories. Each statistic has a range of 1 to 99. The categories are &quot;strength&quot;, the effectiveness of physical attacks; &quot;defense&quot;, the ability to reduce damage received; &quot;agility&quot;, the effectiveness of ranged weapons or skills and at avoiding attacks; and &quot;mana&quot;, the effectiveness of magical attacks. A character&#x27;s health is measured in &quot;hit points&quot; (&quot;HP&quot;), consisting of a current HP statistic and a maximum HP statistic, ranging from 0 to 999. Character statistics are relative to their class—humans have higher HP levels, strength, and defense, and mutants are physically weaker but enjoy a higher mana statistic. Human and mutant statistics can be amplified by worn equipment of different types. Monster-class characters are dependent on their sub-class, and their statistics vary greatly.

Humans raise their statistics through items that grant permanent bonuses, such as &quot;STRENGTH&quot; or &quot;HP200&quot;. Mutant attributes simply increase by random increments after battles, and new abilities may be gained (or lost) in the process. Monsters change in power by consuming &quot;meat&quot; dropped in battles; depending the monster&#x27;s current sub-class and the meat&#x27;s origin, the monster may transform into a stronger or weaker sub-class or fully recover health. Later versions of the game released upon the WonderSwan and mobile phones removed the latter effect entirely.

===Equipment and abilities===
The basic function of equipment in &quot;SaGa&quot; games is to increase character attributes. Arming a character with a gold helmet increases his or her base defense statistic, for example. The amount of equipment that can be placed on any one character at any time depends on the character&#x27;s class. Humans can hold eight, mutants four, and monsters none. There are five types of armor: &quot;shields&quot;, &quot;helmets&quot;, &quot;breastplates&quot;, &quot;gauntlets&quot;, and &quot;shoes&quot;. Only one of each at a time may be added to one character and cannot be added to monsters. Weapons, consisting of swords, hammers, whips, spell books, and guns, utilize either the strength, agility or mana attribute of a character, and can be used only a certain number of times before breaking and being removed from the player&#x27;s inventory. Shields can be used as items in combat, most with a limited number of uses, and allow the user to evade enemy attacks.

Mutants and monsters have different spells and abilities depending on their battle experience and sub-class. These come in one of four categories: &quot;attack&quot;, &quot;non-combative&quot;, &quot;healing&quot;, and &quot;resistances/weaknesses&quot;. When used in combat, attack spells and abilities will damage a target by an elemental type, while non-combative spells and abilities inflict various status ailments (such as &quot;blindness&quot;) or grant benefits upon a target. Healing spells and abilities restore a target&#x27;s HP and can be used outside of combat. Certain spells and abilities have added traits, like affecting a group of enemies or draining HP from a target. Each spell and ability has a finite number of uses, and once depleted the party must visit an inn to recharge them. Resistances and weaknesses are abilities that are active throughout combat. Represented by an &quot;O&quot; or &quot;X&quot; next to the related element or status ailment, they respectively give the user either resistance or weakness to one or more types of attack; status ailments grant immunity against a particular ailment.

Curative items can be found or purchased in the game through various means, each with a limited number of uses and able to be activated from a character&#x27;s inventory or the items sub-menu to restore HP or remove a status ailment in or out of combat from a single target. Like other inventory items, in order to be used during combat these must be placed in a party member&#x27;s equipment slot prior to battle.

===Combat===
Combat is initiated when the player encounters an enemy, which changes the map to the &quot;battle screen&quot;. The enemy appears at the top, above the current party characters; each battle uses a menu-driven turn-based system. At the beginning of each turn, the player selects whether to fight or attempt to run. If the fight option is selected, the player selects an action for each party member from his or her equipment or skills to attack, defend, use magic, or use equipped items. Once the player has chosen actions for each player character, the player characters and enemy begin battle. Participants move one at a time determined by their agility statistic. If the player tries the &quot;attempt to run&quot; option and it fails, the party skip their turn and the enemy attacks. Combat ends if the party successfully flees, all enemies are defeated, or all player characters are defeated; in the last case, the game ends and must be reloaded from the last save.

Winning battles may award the player money (&quot;GP&quot;) and items. Enemy monsters occasionally drop meat, which can be consumed by monster-class characters. Mutant classes may &quot;evolve&quot; at this point, randomly gaining either increased statistics or a new random magic spell or ability, possibly overwriting an existing one. Party members that lose HP during combat can have them restored via curative items, spells, inns, or elements of the world such as healing fountains. If a party member other than the starting character is defeated in battle, he or she loses a &quot;heart&quot; and must be resurrected in a town via the building with a large heart-shaped symbol on it. Defeated characters with no remaining hearts cannot be revived. An item can be bought at significant expense to restore a heart to a character. Alternatively, a fallen party member can also be replaced completely with a new character recruited from a town guild, regardless of the number of hearts they have remaining.

==Story==
===Setting===
&quot;The Final Fantasy Legend&quot; takes place on several worlds centered around a large tower, built by the Creator in ancient times (God in the Japanese version) to link worlds. There are four unique major worlds that make up different layers of the tower: the World of Continent at the base, the World of Ocean on the 5th floor, the World of Sky on the 10th, and the World of Ruins on the 16th. Time does not flow at a constant pace between levels of the tower, rendering some worlds more technologically advanced than others. Various monsters come forth from the tower into each world; many are hostile, but some of them are friendly to humans and willing to coexist. An offshoot of the human race (named mutants, espers in the Japanese version) also exists in each world; they are the magic-attuned descendants of a union between humans and the World of Continent&#x27;s older races.

The World of Continent is a large land mass ruled by three kings in constant war for control of their world. They each carry an object needed to open the tower&#x27;s entrance. The World of Ocean consists of various small islands surrounded by water, each connected by small caves. Pirates roam the sea of this world, forbidding travel by ship. The World of Sky contains large land masses suspended in clouds, and is ruled by a powerful dictator from his flying castle. The World of Ruins is a technologically advanced cityscape, reduced to a post-apocalyptic wasteland by constant monster attacks.

===Plot===
Standing in front of the tower, the hero and party learn that they cannot climb it to paradise without first unsealing its base door. In the base world, three kings named Armor, Sword, and Shield fight for dominance using a piece of legendary equipment corresponding to their names. Visiting King Armor, the party learns that he is in love with a girl who returns his feelings, but cannot marry him, as a bandit holds her village hostage in return for her love. They defeat the bandit, and the king gives them his armor in gratitude. King Sword attacks the heroes, who vanquish him and take the sword. Lastly, King Shield is murdered by his own steward, and after a short fight, the party recovers his shield. Restoring the items to a statue of a great hero, they receive the Black Sphere, but are attacked by Gen-bu, the first of four fiends controlled by Ashura. They defeat him and use the power of the Sphere to enter the tower.

They climb the tower and come to another door; inside lies a second world surrounded by large bodies of water. By navigating caves, they find a floating island which allows them to travel around the world by air. They locate an old man, Ryu-O, and solve his riddle to obtain the Airseed, allowing them to breathe underwater and enter the undersea palace. They encounter the second fiend, Sei-ryu; they defeat him and recover half of the second sphere. Upon returning to Ryu-O, he reveals himself to be the guardian of the other half of the sphere, and the two halves form the Blue Sphere.

Using the Blue Sphere to continue up the tower, the party comes to a world of clouds, dominated by Byak-ko and an army of thugs. They learn that Byak-ko recently wiped out an underground resistance movement, except for Millie and Jeanne, the two daughters of its leader. The party temporarily joins Byak-ko&#x27;s gang to find the girls, and attempt to defend them until Millie betrays Jeanne and the party is captured. Breaking free, they confront the fiend, who tries to kill Millie; Jeanne takes the blow and the party engages the fiend. They defeat him, recover the White Sphere, and continue their journey.

The fourth world is a post-apocalyptic wasteland; Su-Zaku roams the surface defended by an impenetrable forcefield. The party retreats to an abandoned subway for refuge and meets Sayaka, who directs them to the nearest town. There the party is confronted by the leader of a biker gang, So-Cho, but his sister Sayaka intervenes and the two groups agree to work together to defeat Su-Zaku. As they gather the needed parts for a device to deactivate the forcefield, So-Cho sacrifices his life to guide the party through an atomic power plant. Beasts then ambush the town, and Su-Zaku kidnaps Sayaka. The party defeats Su-Zaku, earns the Red Sphere and travels on.

Climbing the tower, the party discovers the remains of a family that attempted to reach Paradise but failed, and a library suggesting Ashura is controlled by someone else. They encounter him at the top, guarding the final door; he offers each of them control of one of the worlds, but they refuse and defeat him. Before they can pass through the door, a trap drops them to the bottom floor. Encountering the allies they made along their journey, they decide to rescale the tower. As they climb stairs that wrap outside of the tower, they engage each of the fiends revived and defeat them. They find the Creator at the summit, and learn that the fiends and the tower itself are actually part of a game created by him to see heroes defeat evil; for succeeding they would be granted a wish as a reward. Angry at his manipulation, they reject the reward and challenge the Creator, who insists that because he created everything he was allowed to use them as he saw fit. They then attack and defeat the Creator in a fierce battle. The heroes then discover a door leading to an unknown location; they consider entering, but decide to return to their own world.

==Development==
&quot;The Final Fantasy Legend&quot; was the first installment of the &quot;SaGa&quot; series in Japan and the first Game Boy game produced by Square. Square president Masafumi Miyamoto requested developers create a Game Boy game after he noticed the success of &quot;Tetris&quot; and the popularity of the handheld system. Akitoshi Kawazu and partner Koichi Ishii decided that instead of creating a game similar to &quot;Tetris&quot;, they would produce what they felt customers desired most: a role-playing game.

Square&#x27;s concept for the game was a title that could be completed in six to eight hours, based on the duration of an airplane flight between Narita, Japan and Honolulu, Hawaii. Developers sought to optimize the game for short bursts of gameplay, as if played by a train passenger between stations. Square raised random battle encounter rate relative to its other role playing games, ensuring players would have at least one enemy encounter during short playtime to maintain an interesting experience. &quot;The Final Fantasy Legend&quot; was designed to be difficult and feature advanced gameplay, described by Kawazu as the main difference between &quot;SaGa&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;. Square implemented several other ideas to distance the games, notably the &quot;meat&quot; system to allow players to collect enemy abilities, though these proved difficult to portray at first.

Kawazu took a direct hand in shaping the game&#x27;s scenario development, working alongside Ishii, Takashi Tokita, and Hiroyuki Ito, who were involved in other Square projects at the time. Ishii and Ito developed the game&#x27;s world layout and geography as well; Ryōko Tanaka designed the background graphics. Tokita developed character concept art and handled the in-game sprites. The Japanese cover artwork was designed by Katsutoshi Fujioka. The monochrome screen of the Game Boy proved an obstacle, as some graphics such as fire were more difficult to portray without color. As a result, they had to develop a world that &quot;works in black and white&quot;. Tanaka later revealed that the 2-megabit capacity of contemporary Game Boy cartridges severely limited their designs; the team removed some elements from the finished game to ensure peak performance.

===Audio===
&quot;The Final Fantasy Legend&quot;″s soundtrack was composed by Nobuo Uematsu and consists of sixteen tracks. Uematsu struggled with composition at first, as the Game Boy&#x27;s sound hardware was different from the Famicom&#x27;s, featuring a new stereo option, unique waveforms, and only three musical notes. Kawazu wanted the game&#x27;s music to resemble that of Square&#x27;s two preceding &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; titles, but Uematsu chose to develop new waveforms. The music was severely limited by the Game Boy&#x27;s technical specifications, having only three note types available.

Square has reused several songs from the game (notably the &quot;Battle&quot; theme) in later titles and released them on compilation soundtracks. The introductory music, titled &quot;Prologue&quot;, appeared remixed as the opening for the next two &quot;SaGa&quot; games. &quot;Heartful Tears&quot; (also known as &quot;Wipe Your Tears Away&quot;) became a staple for later &quot;SaGa&quot; titles, used in five of the games and arranged differently each time. Fifteen tracks were later included in the 1991 two-disc &quot;All Sounds of SaGa&quot; soundtrack, encompassing the Game Boy &quot;SaGa&quot; series and re-released by Square Enix in December 2004 as &quot;SaGa Zenkyoku Shu&quot;. The final track of the set, &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot;, is a synthesizer-arranged version of six of the game&#x27;s tracks combined into one by Uematsu. In the liner notes for &quot;All Sounds of SaGa&quot;, Uematsu states he enjoys listening to the track while remembering scenes from the game. The Kanagawa Philharmonic Orchestra played the song in the &quot;Press Start 2008 -Symphony of Games-&quot; concert as part of the &quot;When Nobuo Uematsu Was Young&quot; medley, while the &quot;Main Theme&quot; was played alongside &quot;Save the World&quot; from &quot;Final Fantasy Legend II&quot; on July 9, 2011, at the &quot;Symphonic Odysseys&quot; concert.

===Merchandise===
Several items of merchandise have been released for the game, including books and telephone cards. Futabasha Publishers Ltd. released a book in February 1990 titled &quot;Makai Toushi Sa·Ga—Boukenshatachi no Rekuiemu&quot; (, Requiem of the Adventurers). Written by Misa Ikeda, the 287-page book was part of Futabasha&#x27;s Game Boy Adventure series for children, and detailed a hero&#x27;s trek to the top of the tower to reach Paradise. In August, Square featured the game in &quot;Final Fantasy Ryūkishi Dan - Knights&quot; (=, Final Fantasy Dragon Knights), a fan book which consisting of reactions and artworks to the series. The game was one of four titles featured in October 1992 by &quot;Game Players&quot; magazine on a video tape named &quot;Game Player&#x27;s Gametape for Game Boy Games&quot;, which demonstrated the game and offered a gameplay tutorial.

==Versions and re-releases==

Square released the game December 1989 in Japan as &quot;Makai Toushi Sa·Ga&quot; and included a map for the four major worlds in the game; a revised version followed shortly after. Square translated it to English in March 1990, and planned to release it in North America with new artwork as &quot;The Great Warrior Saga&quot;. Square retitled it &quot;The Final Fantasy Legend&quot; before releasing it on September 30, 1990, to tie into the popularity of the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; video game. Developers made slight modifications for this version, such as removing the game&#x27;s credits and adjusting the longevity of certain weapons. Changes to the text were also made, including the omission of some of Ryu-O&#x27;s riddles, removal of mention about self-sacrifice and a hint of the Tower&#x27;s true purpose. Notably, the exchange between the player&#x27;s party and the Creator, where the latter reveals that he created Asura simply out of boredom, is altered. In 1998, Sunsoft acquired the license to the Game Boy &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games, re-releasing them in North America the same year. Despite advertising compatibility with Nintendo&#x27;s Game Boy Color handheld, the re-released version featured no enhancements.

Square re-released of &quot;The Final Fantasy Legend&quot; for Bandai&#x27;s WonderSwan Color unit; the Japan-exclusive port debuted in March 2002 under the Japanese title. Toshiyuki Itahana redrew the concept art and graphics, and Square added animated cutscenes. Developers also enabled players to see in advance what a monster would transform into before eating meat left behind after battle. The port allowed playthrough of the intact original Game Boy version. Among other changes and additions were gameplay tweaks, a bestiary, and an added feature that allowed players to automatically target an enemy for attack in combat.

As of January 2007, Square Enix had renewed their trademark on the Japanese name for the game, and at Square Enix&#x27;s 2007 Tokyo Game Show in September made a mobile phone port of the WonderSwan version available for play. Square released the game for download in late 2008 for Japanese i-mode, EZweb compatible phones, and Yahoo! Mobile compatible phones. The port removed the bestiary mode and original Game Boy version of the game, and condensed some of the in-game cutscenes. It added Japanese kanji support and extra shops with new equipment throughout the quest.

In 2020, the original version was re-released alongside the other two Game Boy &quot;SaGa&quot; titles for the Nintendo Switch. The collection was published worldwide by Square Enix on December 19 under the title &quot;Collection of SaGa: Final Fantasy Legend&quot;. It was a digital exclusive release, and included English and Japanese text options worldwide. Production began at Square Enix so players could enjoy the original &quot;SaGa&quot; trilogy on modern hardware. While Kawazu had earlier plans to bring the originals onto newer hardware, the series&#x27; 30th anniversary provided a good opportunity to fulfil his wish.

The port included color and resolution options, higher speed options during gameplay, control options that emulated the Game Boy console, a commemorative track created by later composer Kenji Ito, and new artwork by Fujioka. The minor adjustments were done to reflect modern gaming tastes, but otherwise the games were unaltered. The WonderSwan port of the first &quot;SaGa&quot; was considered for release, but it was decided to leave it out to focus on the originals. While the titles were rebranded as part of the &quot;SaGa&quot; series, their original &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; branding was retained as a subtitle to avoid undue confusion for original players. This edition was the first time the Game Boy titles officially released in Europe.

==Reception and legacy==
&quot;The Final Fantasy Legend&quot; is Square&#x27;s first game to sell over a million copies; the Game Boy version alone shipped 1.37 million copies worldwide (1.15 million in Japan) as of March 2003. Square quickly released two sequels for the Game Boy, and marketed subsequent &quot;SaGa&quot; games on other video game consoles. The one-eyed monster featured on the Japanese box art later became the series&#x27; mascot, appearing in the sequel as a character named &quot;Mr. S&quot;. Game Freak founder Satoshi Tajiri cited the game&#x27;s influence behind the Game Boy &quot;Pokémon&quot; series, stating it gave him the idea that the system could handle more than action games.

Upon release, &quot;Makai Toushi Sa·Ga&quot; was acclaimed by Japanese critics. &quot;Famitsu&quot; awarded the game an overall score of 35 out of 40. Among its panel of four reviewers, three gave it 9 out of 10, while one gave it 8 out of 10. This made it one of their two highest-rated games of 1989, along with &quot;Ys I &amp; II&quot;. It entered the &quot;Famitsu&quot; Platinum Hall of Fame, being one only seven games up until 1989 to have received a score of at least 35 or above from &quot;Famitsu&quot;.

Western critics gave mostly positive reviews upon its initial release. Author Jeff Rovin heavily praised the title in the book &quot;How to Win at Game Boy Games&quot;, citing the thorough manual and considering the game a &quot;masterful achievement for the Game Boy unit, and a superlative game of [its] kind&quot;, though not as complex as &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;. In May 1991, &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; named the game the third all-around best Game Boy game of the previous year, and in September 1997 they ranked it 70th on their list of the &quot;Top 100&quot; games to appear on a Nintendo system, stating that it had &quot;stayed true to the Square Soft tradition&quot;. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; in 1991 called the game &quot;a little slow in spots, but, like &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;, worth your patience&quot;, and a &quot;good quest&quot;. The newspaper gave the game ratings of 8 out of 10 and 7 out of 10. German gaming magazine &quot;Power Play&quot; gave the game a score of 78%, and praised it for showing potential for the Game Boy as the first role-playing game on the platform.

The Game Boy version of the game received mixed reviews in retrospective. IGN called &quot;The Final Fantasy Legend&quot; a &quot;compelling RPG with a complex gameplay system and a solid soundtrack&quot;, but complained about the game&#x27;s difficulty and &quot;dated&quot; graphics. Allgame praised the title on its merits as a role-playing game, but criticized its high difficulty and lack of a sense of direction. 1UP&#x27;s Retronauts described its gameplay as a successor to &quot;Final Fantasy II&quot;″s, though added that the systems involved were not properly refined until its sequel; they further stated that the randomness of the mutant and monster character classes made the game very difficult. Spencer Yip of Siliconera named it as a game he was thankful for playing, citing it as opening his mind to story-based games more so than titles like &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;, and in part led to the creation of the website.

TechnoBuffalo&#x27;s Ron Duwell said that, while it was regarded less favorably than its sequels, its flaws could be worked around and added that there was no such other title to compete like &quot;The Final Fantasy Legend&quot;. 1UP.com&#x27;s Jeremy Parish called it one of the &quot;essential&quot; games for the Game Boy as well as one of the best of 1989, noting its introduction of new ideas that contrasted the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series and calling it &quot;a pretty decent portable RPG in its own right&quot;. GameDaily named it a definite game for Game Boy alongside the related &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; titles, describing it as providing &quot;hours of role-playing excitement&quot;. Andrew Vanden Bossche described the game as &quot;unusual&quot; amongst Japanese roleplaying games, describing its narrative as &quot;loosely connected experiences rather than the sort of epic narrative the RPG genre is commonly thought of&quot;. As a result, the off-screen deaths of non-player characters felt more &quot;poignant&quot; and an example of memento mori. However, he also felt the monster class system as counter-intuitive, as frequently said classes emphasized the point of enemies as &quot;designed to pose challenges, not overcome them&quot;. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;, &quot;Game Informer&quot;, &quot;Pocket Games&quot;, and GameSpot shared this sentiment; the latter three named it one of the top fifty games for the Game Boy.

The difficulty and significance of the game&#x27;s final boss, the Creator, has elicited several mentions. &quot;GamePro&quot; named him one of the &quot;47 Most Diabolical Video-Game Villains of All Time&quot;, placing him 37th on the list and adding &quot;You gotta wonder... how many hit points did the developers give God?&quot; 1UP.com described the battle as &quot;epic&quot;, considering it part of a recurring theme of Japanese role-playing games in which characters band together to kill God. Comedian Jackie Kashian referenced the Creator on &quot;Comedy Central Presents&quot;, describing the game&#x27;s final battle as &quot;the worst premise ever of any video game&quot;, and recalling how she still tried for eight months to defeat the boss. Despite the final boss&#x27; difficulty, it can be killed easily by the instant-death &quot;chainsaw&quot; weapon. In 2009, Square Enix battle planner Nobuyuki Matsuoka paid homage to the fact in the game &quot;Final Fantasy XIII&quot;, by deliberately giving the title&#x27;s final boss a similar vulnerability. Square brought back the character as a boss in later SaGa games &quot;Imperial SaGa Eclipse&quot; and &quot;Romancing SaGa Re;univerSe&quot;, the former of which included a line referencing his weakness to the chainsaw.

<text>Final Fantasy Adventure, known in Japan as or simply and later released in Europe as Mystic Quest, is a 1991 action role-playing game developed and published by Square for the Game Boy. It is a spin-off of the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series and the first game in the &quot;Mana&quot; series. 

Originally developed under the name &quot;Gemma Knights&quot;, it features gameplay roughly similar to that of the original &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;, but with the addition of role-playing statistical elements. A remake, &quot;Sword of Mana&quot;, was released for the Game Boy Advance in 2003, changing the plot and many gameplay aspects. A second remake was released on mobile phones in Japan which improved the graphics and music of the original version. A third remake, &quot;Adventures of Mana&quot;, was released for iOS, Android, and PlayStation Vita on February 4, 2016.

The story follows the hero and the heroine as they attempt to thwart the Dark Lord of Glaive and his sorcerer assistant, Julius, from destroying the Tree of Mana and dooming their world. The game was released with many familiar elements of the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series, such as chocobos, but these were later changed to feature common enemies and the gameplay style of the &quot;Mana&quot; series.

&quot;Final Fantasy Adventure&quot; was met with generally positive reviews at the time of its release. Over the course of time, reviewers have considered it one of the best action adventure games on the Game Boy. The game also spawned an entirely new game series, called the &quot;Mana&quot; series, which became a successful video game role-playing franchise. Its sequel, &quot;Secret of Mana&quot;, was released in 1993. A port for mobile was released on Mobile in Japan in 2006. A port was also released as part of the &quot;Collection of Mana&quot; on Nintendo Switch on 2017 and 2019.

== Gameplay ==
The gameplay is similar to the original &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; for the NES: the world is viewed from a top-down camera angle, it is divided up into many different squares that can fit on the screen, and the main character can move up, down, left, and right across the screen. The player can interact with individuals within towns by gathering information and buying or selling items and equipment. A variety of enemies can be battled on a field screen to gain experience, GP, and items. Within dungeon areas, a number of puzzles may be present and required to be solved in order for the player to advance. The player can also save at any point. A number of weapons can be found throughout the game to maneuver through obstacles such as cutting through trees and thorns.

The main character possesses several statistics, including hit points, power, and stamina, which can all increase upon gaining an experience level. Magic spells, which expend the character&#x27;s MP, can be used to heal oneself or damage enemies. These spells can only be found in certain locations or obtained from other characters at specific plot intervals. In addition, the protagonist has a power gauge that affects his attack strength—the higher the gauge, the stronger his attack will be. The speed at which it fills is directly affected by the character&#x27;s will level. The gauge will slowly fill up over time, but once the main character attacks, the gauge is emptied. When the gauge is completely filled up and the main character attacks with a weapon, he will perform a special attack.

One additional non-player character may occasionally accompany the main character in the story and can perform different activities to aid the main character in his quest. The game introduced the ability to kill townspeople, something that many Japanese role-playing video games of the time lacked.

==Plot==
The Hero (named by the player, officially called Sumo) is a prisoner of the Dark Lord. One day, the Hero&#x27;s friend informs him of the Dark Lord&#x27;s goals, and he urges him to seek a Knight named Bogard. As the Hero escapes imprisonment, he learns that the Dark Lord is seeking a key to the Mana Sanctuary in order to control the Mana Tree, an energy source that sustains life. The Hero is befriended by the Heroine (named by the player, officially called Fuji) who is also seeking Bogard. The two find Bogard, who recommends they seek out a man named Cibba. During their journey to meet him, the Heroine is kidnapped. With the aid of a mysterious man, she is later rescued by the Hero. When they meet Cibba, he plays a message left by the Heroine&#x27;s mother, who reveals she is a descendant of the guardians of the Mana Tree and her pendant is the key to it. The mysterious man, upon discovering that the heroine holds the pendant, reveals himself to be Julius, the Dark Lord&#x27;s advisor, and kidnaps her. The Hero then attempts to rescue the Heroine, but he fails and is knocked off of Julius&#x27;s airship. However, the Heroine gives the Hero the pendant just before he falls.

The Hero is then reunited with Amanda, an escapee from his prison, who steals the pendant in order to win her brother Lester&#x27;s freedom. The mayor of Jadd, Davias, takes the pendant, but he transforms Lester into a parrot. The Hero and Amanda confront a Medusa for its tear, which will break the spell. They kill it, but Amanda is infected by the Medusa&#x27;s attack, causing her to transform into one herself. The Hero reluctantly kills her, and uses her tears to break Lester&#x27;s spell. Lester avenges Amanda&#x27;s death by killing Davias, who reveals that he gave the pendant to the Dark Lord. The Hero confronts and defeats the Dark Lord; however, Hero discovers that the Heroine is under Julius&#x27; mind control and has opened the entrance to the Mana Tree. Julius reveals he is the last survivor of the Vandole Empire, the empire who attempted to control the Mana Tree years ago, and handily defeats the Hero.

Realizing he is powerless to defeat Julius, the Hero learns from Cibba about a powerful sword called Excalibur. Cibba helps him find the Excalibur only to find a rusty sword instead. He explains that the rusty sword is the Excalibur and would reveal its true strength to whoever it finds worthy. The Hero then raises Dime Tower to reach the Mana Sanctuary and meets a robot known as Marcie. After reaching the top, the tower begins to collapse and Marcie sacrifices himself by throwing the Hero across. After obtaining and passing the sword&#x27;s trials, the Hero confronts and defeats Julius at the cost of the Mana Tree&#x27;s life. The Mana Tree reveals that she is the Heroine&#x27;s mother and before dying, asks the Heroine to succeed her current position. The Heroine agrees and bids farewell to the Hero as she becomes the next Mana Tree, and the Hero her guardian.

==Development==
Square trademarked &quot;Seiken Densetsu&quot; in 1987 intending to use it for a game project subtitled &quot;The Emergence of Excalibur&quot;, and led by Kazuhiko Aoki for the Famicom Disk System. According to early advertisements, the game would consist of an unprecedented five floppy disks, making it one of the largest titles developed for the Famicom up until that point. Although Square solicited pre-orders for the game, Kaoru Moriyama, a former Square employee, affirms that management canceled the ambitious project before it advanced beyond the early planning stages. In October 1987, customers who had placed orders were sent a letter informing them of the cancellation and had their purchases refunded. The letter also suggested to consider placing an order on another upcoming Square role-playing game in a similar vein: &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;.

After the release of the third &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; title in 1990, Square offered designer Koichi Ishii to direct a spin-off series game. It began development for the Game Boy under the working title &quot;Gemma Knights&quot;; eventually, Square revived the trademarked name and released the game as &quot;Seiken Densetsu: Final Fantasy Gaiden&quot;. It was later released in Europe as &quot;Mystic Quest&quot;. Ishii suggested the basis of the game&#x27;s story, while scenario writer Yoshinori Kitase helped write the game&#x27;s script. Ishii designed all of the characters himself, while Goro Ohashi was responsible for the development of the game system.

The &quot;Mana&quot; series, of which &quot;Final Fantasy Adventure&quot; was the first game, was the result of Koichi Ishii&#x27;s desire to create a fictional world. In Ishii&#x27;s opinion, &quot;Mana&quot; is not a series of video games, but rather a world which is illustrated by and can be explored through video games. When working on the series, Koichi Ishii drew inspiration from abstract images from his memories of childhood, as well as films and fantasy books that captivated him as a child. Ishii took care to avoid set conventions, and his influences are correspondingly very wide and non-specific. Nonetheless, among his literary influences, he acknowledges Tove Jansson&#x27;s &quot;Moomin&quot;, Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;, and J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;.

=== Music ===

The was released in Japan on July 15, 1991. Most of the tracks were composed by Kenji Ito, while track 16, &quot;Chocobo Tanjou (Chocobo&#x27;s Birth)&quot;, is credited to Square composer Nobuo Uematsu. , a set of arranged tracks was also released on September 30 the same year. Both albums were compiled into &quot;Seiken Densetsu: Final Fantasy Gaiden Sound Collections&quot;, originally released on August 18, 1995. The game&#x27;s music was included in a 20th anniversary CD compilation of all of the &quot;Mana&quot; series games&#x27; soundtracks. A second arranged album titled was released on December 10, 1998. The album was compiled by Yu Hong Ishikawa and Kushiro Negishi.

==Versions and merchandise==

In 1998, Sunsoft obtained the license for it and re-released it along with the &quot;Final Fantasy Legend&quot; games. This version was advertised as having Game Boy Color support, although the release was not enhanced in any way. RPGamer reported in July 2004 that Square Enix was polling die-hard customers, testing the feasibility of porting &quot;Final Fantasy Adventure&quot; to the Nintendo DS. GamesRadar listed &quot;Final Fantasy Adventure&quot; as one of the titles they wanted in the 3DS Virtual Console.

The game received a remake for the Game Boy Advance called &quot;Sword of Mana&quot; in 2003. The original version was remade again to mobile phones and released on August 16, 2006, for SoftBank&#x27;s 3G network. It was later ported onto i-Mode distribution service on November 6 and EZweb distribution service on February 5, 2007. The gameplay of the mobile phone version is closer to the original game&#x27;s design, but featuring updated graphics and sound, an improved world map, and other minor changes. The characters have been redesigned several times between each remake. A 3D remake, &quot;Adventures of Mana&quot;, was released in 2016 for PlayStation Vita, Android and iOS. A port of the original game was released with ports of &quot;Secret of Mana&quot; and &quot;Trials of Mana&quot; as part of the &quot;Seiken Densetsu Collection&quot; on June 1, 2017 in Japan and on June 11, 2019 in North America and Europe as &quot;Collection of Mana&quot; for the Nintendo Switch.

Two guidebooks have been released in Japan: and , each of which contains character illustrations and manga. The guidebooks were released in May and August 1991 respectively.

=== Other manga ===
&quot;Final Fantasy Adventure&quot; is one of the video games featured in the manga titled &quot;Rock&#x27;n Game Boy&quot;, by Shigeto Ikehara and published by Comic BomBom from October 1989 to December 1991.

== Reception ==
According to Square&#x27;s publicity department, the game sold 700,000 units worldwide, with 500,000 of these sold in Japan.

&quot;Final Fantasy Adventure&quot; was featured in &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; when it was re-released in the United States. &quot;IGN&quot; praised the Game Boy re-release version noting its strong story, graphics, and music. They additionally praised the game&#x27;s puzzle elements as innovative and drew comparisons to &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Link&#x27;s Awakening&quot;, though noted that its role-playing gameplay did not blend well with its action-oriented nature. &quot;RPGFan&quot; also praised the game and called it one of the best RPG titles for Game Boy. &quot;RPGamer&quot; praised the game&#x27;s plot and the characters. &quot;Nintendojo&quot; also gave similar praise to the game but noting it being vastly different from other &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; titles.

The game has been perceived very positively in the years following its initial release. &quot;GameDaily&quot; named it alongside the other Game Boy &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; titles as definitive games for the system, describing it as providing &quot;hours of role-playing&quot; to play. The sentiment was shared by gaming magazine &quot;Pocket Games&quot;, which ranked the titles together 8th out of the Top 50 games for the Game Boy, stating that every game in the series is a classic with well-written scripts and solid characters. &quot;Kotaku&quot; praised the original release of the game as a &quot;really great action-RPG&quot;. &quot;1UP.com&quot; called the game ambitious for its time, writing that it represented an evolution of the overhead perspective action adventure genre. They also rated the game as &quot;Worth It!&quot; in terms of buying and enjoying the original game in 2007, and noted it as the origins of the &quot;Mana&quot; series&#x27; many unique gameplay features. &quot;GamesRadar&quot; named it the 13th best Game Boy game ever made, noting that its interesting leveling system and a large number of collectible items made up for a poor English translation. &quot;Game Informer&quot; also praised the game&#x27;s leveling system, though it did call it a &quot;simplistic&quot; title in comparison to its sequels.

<doc id="52765" wikidata="Q17214824" url="?curid=52765" title="Chocobo's Mysterious Dungeon">
<text>is a roguelike dungeon crawler video game developed and published by Square. A spin-off of the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series of role-playing video games, it was also the first entry in what would become the &quot;Chocobo&quot; series. It saw a Japan-only release on December 23, 1997, for PlayStation, and a version was released on March 4, 1999, for WonderSwan. The game was re-released in 2010 on PlayStation Network in Japan as a PSOne Classic.

The game&#x27;s protagonist is a yellow chocobo, a fictional species of bird in the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; universe, named . The player must fight through procedurally generated dungeons, picking up items and battling enemies.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;Chocobo&#x27;s Mysterious Dungeon&quot; combines real-time combat with an Active Time Battle (ATB) system reminiscent of a &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; game. Attacks have reduced power and accuracy if made before the ATB gauge fills up. The game consists of three dungeons: a 30-level dungeon, a 60-level dungeon, and an infinite dungeon which recycles enemy types every 100 levels.

== Development ==
The game was produced by Koichi Nakamura, the founder of Chunsoft. It also marks the solo composing debut of Masashi Hamauzu, who prepared both the soundtrack and an arrangement album named &quot;Coi Vanni Gialli&quot;.

The game appeared in a booth at Tokyo Game Show 1997, but did not appear in playable form, only having a complete video presentation of the game on the company&#x27;s video wall along with &quot;Front Mission 2&quot; and &quot;Front Mission Alternative&quot;. Upon its release, it was bundled with the &quot;Mysterious Data Disc&quot;, a bonus containing a number of movies from unreleased games and a playable demo of &quot;Xenogears&quot;. In early 1998, it was still the 10th best-selling game in Japan according to Famitsu.

== Reception ==
In pre-release coverage of the game, &quot;IGN&quot; stated that the decision to not show a playable version of the game was &quot;somewhat bizarre&quot;, but that the title was &quot;shaping up quite nicely&quot;, saying that while the game was not as flashy as &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, and lacked any polygonal graphics, it was &quot;obvious&quot; that much effort went into designing the game&#x27;s artwork. They also said that, while there was no word of a US release, they hoped the game would receive one due to the success of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;.

In a post-release review, &quot;The Elf&quot; of &quot;Superjuegos&quot; magazine stated that, while the game&#x27;s setting was &quot;not very attractive&quot;, the gameplay was highly addictive and engaging, with &quot;beautiful&quot; magic, funny characters, and attractive cutscenes. He also called the game&#x27;s music memorable, citing its remixes of classic themes from &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;. However, ECM of &quot;GameFan&quot; had a more negative take, characterizing &quot;Xenogears&quot; as &quot;infinitely better&quot;, while Stephen Frost of &quot;&quot; also stated that the game felt &quot;rushed and [not] very fun&quot;, appending an image of a dead chocobo with the caption &quot;Ugh. What was Square thinking?&quot;

== Legacy ==
&quot;Chocobo&#x27;s Mysterious Dungeon&quot; was the first in the &quot;Mystery Dungeon&quot; series to surpass one million units sold due to its connection to &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; and chocobo protagonist. It was followed by a 1998 sequel, &quot;Chocobo&#x27;s Dungeon 2&quot;. The characters of the game went on to star in the &quot;Chocobo&quot; series, containing numerous different genres.

<doc id="52767" wikidata="Q900305" url="?curid=52767" title="Final Fantasy V">
<text>is a 1992 role-playing video game developed and published by Square. It is the fifth main installment of the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series. The game first appeared only in Japan on Nintendo&#x27;s Super Famicom (known internationally as the Super Nintendo Entertainment System). It has been ported with minor differences to Sony&#x27;s PlayStation and Nintendo&#x27;s Game Boy Advance. An original video animation produced in 1994 called &quot;Final Fantasy: Legend of the Crystals&quot; serves as a sequel to the events depicted in the game. It was released for the PlayStation Network on April 6, 2011, in Japan. An enhanced port of the game, with new high-resolution graphics and a touch-based interface, was released for iPhone and iPad on March 28, 2013, for Android on September 25 the same year and for Windows on September 24, 2015. A more enhanced re-release of the game as part of the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; Pixel Remaster series, was released on November 10, 2021 for Android, iOS, and Windows, for Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 on April 19, 2023, and for Xbox Series X/S on September 26, 2024.

The game begins as a wanderer named Bartz investigates a fallen meteor. There, he encounters several characters, one of whom reveals the danger facing the four Crystals that control the world&#x27;s elements. These Crystals act as a seal on Exdeath, an evil sorcerer. Bartz and his party must keep the Crystals from being exploited by Exdeath&#x27;s influence and prevent his resurgence.

&quot;Final Fantasy V&quot; has been praised for the freedom of customization that the player has over the characters, achieved through the greatly expanded Job System. Despite being released only in Japan, the Super Famicom version sold more than two million copies. The PlayStation version has earned &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; status, selling more than 350,000 copies.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Final Fantasy V&quot; includes many standard role-playing elements as well as renovated features introduced in earlier &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games. Players navigate from a top-down perspective; a traversable overworld connects the various towns, dungeons, and other points of interest. The player can traverse the overworld by foot, Chocobo, hydra-guided ship, wind drake, or airship, depending on the situation. Most towns contain scattered inns for resting, shops for purchasing equipment, and people from whom the player can gain information. The player may also embark on several side quests that become available as the story progresses. Characters grow in strength by gaining experience points from random encounters with monsters on the overworld or in a dungeon. Experience culminates in a &quot;level up&quot;, in which character attributes such as hit points and magic power increase. A menu-based management system allows the player to equip, heal, and change each character&#x27;s selected job outside of battle as well as to save the game&#x27;s progress.

&quot;Final Fantasy V&quot; is the second &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; game to use the Active Time Battle (ATB) system, in which time flows continuously for both the player and enemies during combat. This system was first established in &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot;, but in that game, there was no way to visibly anticipate which character&#x27;s turn would come up next. In &quot;Final Fantasy V&quot;, the player can see which playable character&#x27;s turn is next in battle, in the form of a time gauge—or &quot;ATB Bar&quot;—which fills according to a character&#x27;s speed. When the selected character&#x27;s turn arrives, the player can execute one of several commands, such as attacking the enemy with an equipped weapon, using a special ability or item, or changing the character&#x27;s row position. The ATB mechanic with a gauge, as seen in &quot;V&quot;, would be used in the four following main titles in the series and remains a staple mechanic of the franchise.

===Job System===
The main feature of the gameplay of &quot;Final Fantasy V&quot; is the Job System. Players can freely select jobs (also called &quot;classes&quot;) for their characters to master, allowing each character to gain special abilities and potentially master all 22 jobs (26 in the Game Boy Advance version). Each character begins with only the &quot;Freelancer&quot; class; to gain access to new jobs, players must acquire crystal shards. This system is an improved version of the one in &quot;Final Fantasy III&quot;; several older jobs were either reused or revamped for &quot;V&quot;, such as the Black Mage and Thief. The game also introduces several classes to the series, including the Blue Mage, Time Mage, and Mime. Each of these classes has been featured in numerous &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; installments since.

Once the player gains access to the job system, characters begin to earn a separate form of experience—Ability Points—in conjunction with regular experience points. Characters gain job levels after accumulating AP; as with regular levels, the required amount of experience increases after each job level. AP and job levels do not transfer from class to class. As job levels increase, new skills become available for the character to use in a new form of customization; characters learn job-specific abilities that may be transferred to a new job. For example, a character with the Knight job who has also earned job levels as a Black Mage may set Black Magic as a secondary command, enabling both Black Mage and Knight abilities in battle. The nature of these abilities varies; while some serve as special commands in battle, others may be innate to the class or activated automatically when conditions are met, such as the Thief&#x27;s &quot;Caution&quot; skill, which prevents rear attacks from enemies. This system allows for deeper customization of characters.

==Plot==
===Setting===
The backstory of &quot;Final Fantasy V&quot; is revealed in phases through cutscenes and interactions with non-playable characters. One millennium before the events of the main story, a powerful mage named Enuo imperiled the world using the power of an evil entity called the &quot;Void&quot;. The people retaliated by using twelve legendary weapons to vanquish Enuo, but the Void itself could not be destroyed. Consequently, the people split the world&#x27;s four elemental Crystals into two sets, effectively creating two worlds. The Void then became sealed in a dimensional cleft between the two worlds.

Nearly a thousand years passed without incident, and both worlds prospered due to the powers of their Crystals of Wind, Water, Fire, and Earth. New kingdoms and towns flourished, and travel by ship acted as a critical means of commerce and communication. However, a sinister force was stirring in the second world—ever since the Void incident, malicious demons had been sealed inside a tree in the Great Forest of Moore. The corrupted amalgamation of spirits emerged as Exdeath, the game&#x27;s primary antagonist. When Exdeath attempted to claim the world for himself, a group of heroes called the &quot;Four Warriors of Dawn&quot; (Galuf, Xezat, Dorgann, and Kelger) sealed him within the first world using its Crystals, and peace returned for another thirty years.

===Characters===
&quot;Final Fantasy V&quot; features five player characters, though only up to four are playable at any given time:
* Bartz Klauser - A adventurer who travels the world with his Chocobo companion, Boko. Bartz becomes involved in the main conflict when he investigates the site of a meteorite and befriends Lenna and Galuf. His associated element is Wind, and his strongest attribute is his Strength.
* Lenna Charlotte Tycoon - A princess of Tycoon who follows her father to investigate the Wind Shrine&#x27;s Crystal, she befriends Bartz and Galuf at the meteorite site, and they soon join on her quest. Her associated element is Water, and her strongest attribute is her Spirit.
* Galuf Halm Baldesion - An amnesiac old man whom Bartz and Lenna discover unconscious near the meteorite. He joins the group in order to regain his memory as well as learning of the forces he fought against. His associated element is Earth, and his strongest attribute is his Stamina.
* Faris Scherwiz - A pirate captain who captures Bartz, Lenna, and Galuf when they try to steal her ship. She initially disguises herself as a man, but the party soon discover her secret. Her associated element is Fire, and her attributes are equally strong in all fields. 
* Krile Mayer Baldesion - Galuf&#x27;s granddaughter and princess of Bal, who follows her grandfather to Bartz&#x27;s world. Like Galuf, her associated element is Earth, and her strongest attribute is her Magic.

During the story, the player characters encounter many non-player characters. The other Warriors of Dawn, Dorgann Klauser (Bartz&#x27;s father), Kelger Vlondett, and Xezat Matias Surgate, play important roles. Supporting characters also include engineer Cid Previa, his grandson Mid Previa, and turtle sage Ghido. One of Exdeath&#x27;s henchmen, Gilgamesh, is a recurring mini-boss in the second half of the game. Gilgamesh has appeared in several &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; titles since. All characters concept art was designed by Yoshitaka Amano.

===Story===
King Tycoon departs to investigate the weakening of the Wind Crystal at the Wind Shrine. Bartz witnesses a meteor plunge to the planet&#x27;s surface. He encounters Lenna, King Tycoon&#x27;s daughter; Galuf, an amnesiac old man; and Faris, a pirate captain. They make their way to the Wind Shrine pursuing Lenna&#x27;s father. There the shards of the shattered crystal grant them new powers. An image of King Tycoon appears, saying the crystals have chosen the four adventurers as their protectors.

The party discovers the crystals make their planet habitable and also seal away Exdeath, an evil sorcerer. The party attempts to save the crystals of Water, Fire, and Earth. Each time, they fail but gain new powers from the crystals&#x27; shards. Having been freed, Exdeath defeats the party and returns to his homeworld. King Tycoon, who was controlled by Exdeath to destroy the last crystal, sacrifices himself to save the others.

Galuf&#x27;s granddaughter Krile arrives by a meteorite, restoring Galuf&#x27;s memory completely. He recalls he originated from the same world as Exdeath, and resolves to pursue him back home with Krile. Bartz, Lenna and Faris travel with them.

On Galuf&#x27;s world, Exdeath is already wreaking havoc in pursuit of that world&#x27;s crystals. The party wins a victory against Exdeath&#x27;s lieutenant Gilgamesh, but are blown to a distant continent when a magical barrier is activated during their escape. They deactivate the barrier with help from Galuf&#x27;s allies. The party then travels to Moore Forest in an attempt to protect the world&#x27;s crystals there. Exdeath deceives them into destroying the crystals&#x27; guardians and takes the crystals for himself. Krile arrives to help but is herself trapped by the sorcerer&#x27;s powers. Galuf saves the others from Exdeath at the cost of his own life. His abilities pass to Krile, who joins the party in his place. The party pursues Exdeath to his castle, where they defeat Gilgamesh again and then Exdeath himself. The crystals shatter, reuniting the split worlds.

For a time, it seems Exdeath has been truly destroyed, and the party celebrates in Tycoon. However, a thorn leaps from Krile&#x27;s palm, manifesting as Exdeath, now resurrected and fully in command of the Void. With it, he removes entire towns and kingdoms from existence, tossing them into an interdimensional rift.

The reunification of worlds has opened the pathways to ancient sites where powerful artifacts are hidden. So armed, the party enters the rift. With help from a reformed Gilgamesh, they find Exdeath at the center of the rift seeking the power of the Void. They fight Exdeath, first in his demonic tree form, and then after he transforms into Neo Exdeath, intent on destroying all reality, including himself. The heroes defeat Exdeath and use the crystal shards&#x27; power to seal the Void once more and restore the reunified world and its crystals.

The game&#x27;s ending varies based on how many party members are still alive at Neo Exdeath&#x27;s defeat, detailing the events after the world&#x27;s resurrection. In the end, the remaining group visits Moore Forest and find that the fallen party members have returned to life.

==Development==
&quot;Final Fantasy V&quot; was directed by &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi who, prior to the release of &quot;Final Fantasy IX&quot;, called it his favorite &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; game. The character, image, and title logo designs were created by series illustrator and image designer Yoshitaka Amano, while the actual character sprites were designed by Kazuko Shibuya. The monsters were designed by Tetsuya Nomura. Amano has stated that he counts his depictions of both Faris from &quot;Final Fantasy V&quot; and Terra from &quot;VI&quot; among his favorite &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; designs. The writing of the scenario text was a collaborative effort between Sakaguchi and Yoshinori Kitase. Sakaguchi conceived the plot and was in charge of it, while Kitase tried to include more humor to lighten up the relatively serious story. The Job System was designed by Hiroyuki Ito, who worked on the game as a battle planner alongside Akihiko Matsui. Mode 7 effects were used in the airship sequences, which moving in the airship would cause the planet to rotate on its axis. In total, Square employed a team of 45 people to create the game, and 16 Mbits of space were used to accommodate the sprites, animations, and detailed background. According to &quot;GamePro&quot; in a May 1993 issue, the Japanese authorities had asked Square not to release the game during a school day because schoolchildren would skip class to wait in line for the game.

The official English translation of &quot;Final Fantasy V&quot; began shortly after the release of the Japanese version. The game was to be titled &quot;Final Fantasy III&quot; in North America, but the project was abandoned. Square then announced that due to its differing tone and much higher difficulty from the rest of the series, they would be releasing it in North America as a standalone game with a yet-to-be-determined title, rather than part of the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series. This plan was quickly aborted. Translator Ted Woolsey explained in a 1994 interview, &quot;[&quot;Final Fantasy V&quot; is] just not accessible enough to the average gamer&quot;. Rumors circulated that a second attempt at localization would be made and that the game would be titled &quot;Final Fantasy Extreme&quot;, but this attempt was also canceled. A third attempt was made to port the game to Windows-based personal computers for North American release by developer Top Dog Software, but this was canceled. Another attempt to port the game to Windows for North America was &quot;handled by Eidos Interactive&quot; circa 1998, but it is unclear whether this is the same version Top Dog Software was working on or an actual fourth attempt. The continual canceling of the localization angered fans and led to &quot;Final Fantasy V&quot; becoming one of the first games to receive a complete fan translation.

===Music===

The game&#x27;s soundtrack was composed by Nobuo Uematsu and consists of 56 tracks. A two-disc album was released alongside the game totaling 67 tracks. Uematsu had originally calculated that the game would require more than 100 pieces of music, but he managed to reduce the number to 56. The song &quot;Dear Friends&quot; would become the title piece in the 2004 concert tour &quot;Dear Friends -Music from Final Fantasy-&quot;, chosen to reflect Uematsu&#x27;s appreciation for his music&#x27;s worldwide fan support. The song &quot;Clash on the Big Bridge&quot; would later be arranged by Hitoshi Sakimoto for the &quot;Final Fantasy XII Original Soundtrack&quot; in 2006.

The album &quot;Final Fantasy V: 5+1&quot; was released in 1992 and contained five songs from the original score as well as a previously unreleased Super Famicom version of &quot;Matoya&#x27;s Cave&quot; from the original 1987 &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; for the Nintendo Entertainment System. A collection of arranged tracks, &quot;Final Fantasy V Dear Friends&quot;; a 13-track disc, &quot;Piano Collections Final Fantasy V&quot;; and a short series of remixes, &quot;Final Fantasy V: Mambo de Chocobo&quot;, were all released in 1993. Finally, many of the original songs were included on the North American &quot;Final Fantasy Anthology Soundtrack&quot;, together with the two-game compilation.

==Ports and remakes==
&quot;Final Fantasy V&quot; was ported by Tose to the Sony PlayStation and re-released in Japan on March 19, 1998; it was included in the 1999 release of &quot;Final Fantasy Collection&quot;, alongside &quot;IV&quot; and &quot;VI&quot;. The PlayStation version boasted two new full motion video opening and ending sequences and a &quot;memo-save&quot; feature, but the game otherwise remained unchanged. Square released 50,000 limited edition copies of the collection which included a &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;-themed alarm clock. In the same year, Square released the PlayStation compilation &quot;Final Fantasy Anthology&quot; in North America, which included &quot;Final Fantasy V&quot;, as well as the PlayStation version of &quot;VI&quot;. This would mark the first time the game was published outside Japan, nearly seven years after its initial release. As early as July 1998 there was media coverage of a port to the PC by Square Enix Europe (then Eidos Interactive) that was never officially released. Screenshots of the cancelled Eidos version include English dialogue that appears to be based on the North American localization that would not be released until September 1999. In 2002, Square released this version of the game in Europe and Australia, this time alongside &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot;. The English version of the game received changes from its original format — most notably, Faris was given a Cornish &quot;pirate&quot; accent and there was a different interpretation of character names, such as the names &quot;Bartz&quot; as opposed to &quot;Butz&quot; and &quot;Gill&quot; as opposed to &quot;Guido&quot;, the official romanizations in Japan. The port was re-released as part of the &quot;Final Fantasy 25th Anniversary Ultimate Box&quot; Japanese package in December 2012.

Following the release of the PlayStation 2, Sony reported that the new system had compatibility issues with the &quot;Final Fantasy V&quot; half of &quot;Final Fantasy Anthology&quot;. The game experienced a bug where if players attempted to save their games, a graphical error would occur. Square then released a statement that only the look of the save screen was corrupted, and saving was still possible, and if players wished, repeatedly going into and out of the save screen would make a normal screen eventually appear. This incompatibility was fixed for the PAL and Greatest Hits releases of &quot;Final Fantasy Anthology&quot;.

&quot;Final Fantasy V&quot; was ported a second time by Tose to the Nintendo Game Boy Advance as &quot;Final Fantasy V Advance&quot;, which was released on October 12, 2006, in Japan, November 6 in North America, and April 20, 2007, in Europe. Similar to the Game Boy Advance re-releases of its predecessors, this version features updated graphics, though the changes are very subtle. Additional features include four new jobs (Gladiator, Cannoneer, Necromancer, and Oracle), a new dungeon called &quot;The Sealed Temple&quot;, and a new optional boss from the backstory of &quot;Final Fantasy V&quot;, Enuo, which was designed by Tetsuya Nomura, the monster designer of the original game. In addition, the game included a bestiary, a quick save function, music player, and additional equipment in the style of previous Game Boy Advance re-releases. Like the remakes of its predecessors, &quot;Final Fantasy V Advance&quot; featured a new English translation.

The original version of the game was released on the Virtual Console in Japan in January 2011 for the Wii, in March 2014 for the Wii U and August 2017 for the New 3DS, and the PlayStation version of the game was re-released on the PlayStation Store as a PSOne Classic in Japan and Europe in April 2011 and in North America on November 22.

In early 2010s, Square Enix considered developing a remake of &quot;Final Fantasy V&quot; for Nintendo DS, but was concerned that the technical issues would prevent it from happening. The Nintendo 3DS was also considered for the remake. An iOS port, which was developed by Matrix Software, was released on March 28, 2013 on the Apple App Store for iOS devices, with an Android release via the Google Play Store on September 26. The game features new high-resolution graphics with sprites designed by Kazuko Shibuya, who did the original game&#x27;s artwork, new gameplay features such as movement in eight directions and auto-battle, and contains the Sealed Temple and super-boss Enuo from the Game Boy Advance release. In September 2015 the remaster was released on PC via Steam.

Tetsuya Nomura, director of &quot;Final Fantasy VII Remake&quot;, expressed interest in remaking &quot;Final Fantasy V&quot; and &quot;VI&quot;. Kitase, who produced &quot;Final Fantasy VII Remake&quot;, also expressed a desire to remake &quot;Final Fantasy V&quot;.

A 2D pixel remaster was released in North America for Steam, iOS, and Android on November 10, 2021. Unlike the previous remake, many of the features added in the Gameboy Advance remake are absent from this version.

==Sequel==

In 1994, Square released an original video animation sequel to &quot;Final Fantasy V&quot;, simply titled &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;. Produced by animation studio Madhouse, the anime was released in four 30-minute VHS tapes in Japan and was set two hundred years after the game. The story focuses on four warriors, one of them the descendant of Bartz, protecting the Wind Crystal from the villain Deathgyunos, who pursues it to achieve godhood. It was localized by Urban Vision in 1998 and released in two VHS volumes for North America under the title &quot;Final Fantasy: Legend of the Crystals&quot;.

==Reception==
===Sales===
Within a day of its release in Japan, &quot;Final Fantasy V&quot; sold about 900,000 cartridges for ( at the time, or adjusted for inflation), selling about as many copies as what &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot; (1991) sold on its first day and close to the sold by &quot;Dragon Quest V&quot; (1992) on its first day. &quot;Final Fantasy V&quot; topped the Japanese sales charts in December 1992 and January 1993, selling 2 million copies during its first two months of release. It was Japan&#x27;s fourth multi-million seller released in 1992 (following &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;, &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot;, and &quot;Dragon Quest V&quot;), and ended the year as the second best-selling game of 1992 in Japan (below &quot;Dragon Quest V&quot;).
&quot;Final Fantasy V&quot; went on to sell a total of 2.45 million units for the Super Famicom in Japan. It was also a commercial success overseas in South Korea, where it was the second best-selling game of 1992 (below &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;). The Japanese Game Boy Advance version has also sold nearly 260,000 copies as of December 2007. &quot;Final Fantasy Collection&quot; sold over 400,000 copies in 1999, making it the 31st best selling release of that year in Japan. The North American release of &quot;Final Fantasy Anthology&quot; sold 364,000 copies as of 2004.

===Critical response===
The original Super Famicom version received a positive critical reception upon release, with &quot;Famitsu&quot;″s four reviewers scoring it 34 out of 40, and the first &quot;GameFan&quot; Golden Megawards awarding it for Best Import Game and Best Music (Import Game) of 1992. Retrospectively, 1UP&#x27;s staff wrote that, while the game&#x27;s story was very weak, the gameplay was &quot;another story&quot;, heavily praising the job system and the feature to combine abilities from different job classes, and gave it a score of B−. Allgame&#x27;s retrospective review shared similar sentiments regarding the storyline and job system, adding praise for the addition of hidden events and items for players to search for, giving the game a score of 3.5 out of 5. RPGamer gave it a mixed retrospective review, stating that the game improved on the visual presentation, menu system, and overall field navigation of &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot;, but the &quot;maddeningly high encounter rate&quot;, &quot;average sound selection&quot;, and &quot;washed out&quot; color palette hurt the game&#x27;s presentation, giving it a score of 5/10.

Critics gave generally positive to mixed reviews for the &quot;Anthology&quot; version of the game. GameSpot praised the job system for being &quot;one of the series&#x27; most in-depth and detailed game systems&quot;, but criticized the game for having &quot;paper-thin characters&quot; and a clichéd plot, augmented by a lack of character development during the game&#x27;s fetch quests. They went further to say that the translation was poor and overshadowed by the two previous fan efforts. IGN called &quot;Final Fantasy V&quot;&#x27;s graphics &quot;dated&quot; but cited &quot;incredibly engrossing&quot; job system as the game&#x27;s highlight and praised its music. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; repeated the sentiments towards the job system, adding that while the game suffered from long load times periodically, &quot;Final Fantasy V&quot; was the main reason to buy the collection.

In comparison, reviews of the Game Boy Advance re-release of the game were mostly positive. GameSpot&#x27;s review regarded the game more favorably than its PlayStation counterpart, calling it &quot;better than ever&quot; and citing the strong localization of the script and extensive special features. They further stated that while the game&#x27;s characters seemed unlikable and that the plot felt &quot;predictable or trite&quot;, they felt the game was still more sophisticated than most games at the time, giving the game a score of 8.5. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; wrote that &quot;while playing &quot;Final Fantasy V&quot; is a chore on the PlayStation, it&#x27;s good fun on the GBA because of the vastly improved translation and new features&quot;, further calling it the &quot;definitive&quot; version of one of the series&#x27; best titles. IGN gave the game a score of 8.5, calling it a &quot;must-own&quot; for the portable system and describing it further as always an &quot;entertaining and surprisingly deep role-playing game&quot;. 1UP.com said the port of the game from the Super Famicom to the Game Boy Advance was &quot;rock solid&quot;, and added that while the game&#x27;s story started off at a slow pace, it gradually improved. The review further praised the addition of features and removal of questionable ones that had been added to the &quot;Anthology&quot; version of the game. GameDaily gave the game a score of 7/10, noting that while enjoyable, the high encounter rate, the necessity to constantly engage in battle to gain abilities through the job system, and other aspects made the game feel repetitive at times.

<doc id="52770" wikidata="Q514985" url="?curid=52770" title="Les Claypool">
<text>Leslie Edward Claypool (born September 29, 1963) is an American rock musician. He is the founder, lead singer, bassist, and primary songwriter of the band Primus. Listed as one of the greatest bassists of all time by Rolling Stone, his playing style mixes tapping, flamenco-like strumming, whammy bar bends, and slapping.

Outside of Primus, Claypool has also been involved in a number of side projects, including supergroups such as Oysterhead (with Trey Anastasio and Stewart Copeland) and Colonel Claypool&#x27;s Bucket of Bernie Brains (with Buckethead, Bryan Mantia, and Bernie Worrell). He also fronts the experimental rock projects Colonel Les Claypool&#x27;s Fearless Flying Frog Brigade and Les Claypool&#x27;s Fancy Band. He has self-produced and engineered several solo releases from his own studio, Rancho Relaxo, in California. In 2006, he wrote and directed the mockumentary &quot;Electric Apricot&quot; and released his debut novel &quot;South of the Pumphouse&quot;. He formed musical duos Duo de Twang (with Bryan Kehoe) and The Claypool Lennon Delirium (with Sean Lennon). He has also appeared in the TV show South Park in the intro and theme song.

== Early life ==
Claypool was born into a working-class family of car mechanics in Richmond, California, in 1963. He was raised in El Sobrante, California. He learned to play the bass guitar at age 14, but didn&#x27;t begin a career in music until much later. He attended De Anza High School in Richmond, where he was friends with Kirk Hammett. Claypool worked as a carpenter for several years after graduating from high school.

==Career==
===Early career===
After the death of Metallica bassist Cliff Burton in 1986, Metallica guitarist Kirk Hammett reconnected with Claypool and asked him to audition as Burton&#x27;s replacement. In the Metallica episode of the documentary series &quot;Behind the Music&quot;, Claypool said that he jokingly asked the members of Metallica if they wanted to &quot;jam on some Isley Brothers tunes&quot; during the audition, a reference to his lack of experience with Metallica&#x27;s thrash metal style. He later recalled Hammett had given him a copy of Metallica&#x27;s 1984 album &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot;, which he enjoyed, but Claypool also stressed he &quot;wasn&#x27;t a big metal guy&quot; and did not realize how popular Metallica had become until he arrived at the audition; according to Claypool, he also didn&#x27;t realize at the time that the intro riff of &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; was a bass, and thus didn&#x27;t play it during the audition. Metallica frontman James Hetfield said that Claypool was not offered the job because &quot;he was too good&quot; and &quot;should do his own thing&quot;. Claypool responded by admitting that he &quot;wasn&#x27;t the right guy&quot; for the band due to being a self-proclaimed &quot;weirdo&quot;; he said that Hetfield was just &quot;being nice&quot; with his comments.

===Primus===
Primus began as &quot;Primate&quot; in the mid-1980s, with Claypool on bass, Todd Huth on guitar, and various drummers most notably Jay Lane, although Huth and Lane left shortly thereafter to pursue other projects. Claypool replaced them with guitarist Larry LaLonde and drummer Tim Alexander.

Claypool is considered to be the leader of the band, as well as the driving force behind its blending of funk with other genres. He frequently utilizes the slap-bass technique, prominent in funk music, and is the only member of Primus who comes from a funk background. Because of Claypool&#x27;s strong funk influence, Primus is often described as &quot;thrash-funk&quot; or funk metal, although Claypool dislikes the labels. He said, &quot;We&#x27;ve been lumped in with the funk metal thing just about everywhere. I guess people just have to categorize you.

From 1989 to 2000, Primus was one of the most unusual bands to gain significant mainstream airplay, headlining Lollapalooza in 1993, appearing on &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; and &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; in 1995. They even appeared at Woodstock &#x27;94, where they performed their &quot;Pork Soda&quot; hit &quot;My Name Is Mud&quot; and were pelted with mud by the audience, much to the band&#x27;s displeasure. It drove Claypool to stop playing telling the audience &quot;the song&#x27;s called My Name is Mud, but keep the mud to yourself you son of a bitch&quot;. In 1991, the band was featured in the movie &quot;Bill &amp; Ted&#x27;s Bogus Journey&quot;, performing &quot;Tommy the Cat&quot; live. Claypool and Tom Waits first recorded on each other&#x27;s records in 1991 and have continued to do so since then. In 1997, Primus was asked to play and record the theme song for the animated television show &quot;South Park&quot;. In 1999, he allowed Activision&#x27;s use of the song &quot;Jerry Was a Race Car Driver&quot; in the popular video game &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater&quot;. Primus went on hiatus in 2000.

In mid-2003, Claypool reunited with former Primus drummer Tim Alexander and guitarist Larry LaLonde to record a DVD/EP called &quot;Animals Should Not Try to Act Like People&quot;. In October of the same year, the band embarked on a two-month tour in which two sets were performed per show, the second set consisting of their 1991 release &quot;Sailing the Seas of Cheese&quot; being performed in its entirety. Primus continued touring into 2004, performing their 1990 release &quot;Frizzle Fry&quot; as their second set, as documented on the DVD &quot;Hallucino-Genetics: Live 2004&quot;.

On October 17, 2006, Primus released both their first greatest hits album, &quot;They Can&#x27;t All Be Zingers&quot;, and their third DVD, &quot;Blame It on the Fish&quot;, subtitled &quot;An Abstract Look at the 2003 Primus Tour De Fromage.&quot; The band toured in 2006 on their Primus: The Beat a Dead Horse Tour 2006, and played at a small number of festivals in 2008. In 2010, Alexander, who had left the band for the second time due to lack of interest, was replaced by Jay Lane, who had not played with the band since 1988. The band resumed touring after the free &quot;June 2010 Rehearsal&quot; was released later that year, and a studio album, &quot;Green Naugahyde&quot;, was released in 2011.

In 2013, Lane left Primus for the second time to focus on his other band RatDog, who were coming off hiatus at the time, and was replaced again by Alexander. Primus&#x27; eighth studio album, &quot;Primus &amp; the Chocolate Factory with the Fungi Ensemble&quot;, a re-imagining of the soundtrack from the 1971 film &quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot;, was released in October 2014.

In 2017, Primus released &quot;The Desaturating Seven&quot;, an album that is based on a bedtime story published by Italian author Ul de Rico, which is about a group of rainbow eating goblins. They then started a tour with Mastodon through most of 2018.

In 2024, Alexander resigned from Primus &quot;effective immediately,&quot; seemingly retiring from music due to a &quot;lost passion to play.&quot; The band announced plans to continue touring with members from Claypool&#x27;s other bands and began searching for &quot;the world&#x27;s best drummer&quot; to replace Alexander on X (formerly Twitter).

=== Solo work ===

==== Sausage ====

In 1988 Claypool began a short-lived alternative/funk rock band featuring Todd Huth on guitar and Jay Lane on drums. The group released their first album in April 1994 &quot;Riddles Are Abound Tonight&quot; by Prawn Song Records, and did a few short tours and opened for groups such as Helmet, Rollins Band, and Slayer. The band reunited for a show on December 31, 2019, opening for The Claypool Lennon Delirium and have not returned since.

==== Holy Mackerel ====

In 1996, Claypool produced, engineered, and released a solo album, &quot;Les Claypool and the Holy Mackerel presents&quot; &quot;Highball with the Devil&quot;. He is credited with playing bass, and drums as well as vocals on several tracks as well as guitar. Also on the album are Mark &quot;Mirv&quot; Haggard, Adam Gates, Jay Lane, Joe Gore, Charlie Hunter, and Henry Rollins. The accompanying tour included Haggard and Gates on guitars with Bryan Mantia on drums. It was announced during the Holy Mackerel tour that Mantia had been chosen to become the next Primus drummer.

==== Oysterhead ====
In April 2000, Claypool collaborated with Trey Anastasio (of Phish) and Stewart Copeland (of the Police) to form a supergroup called Oysterhead. Claypool and Anastasio had been looking for an opportunity to collaborate. Each had a mutual interest in playing with Copeland who had been a rock idol of their teen years. Plus, Claypool and Copeland already had an established friendship. Oysterhead were originally intended as a one time performance during Jazz Fest in New Orleans. Though timid of the band&#x27;s sudden and surprising popularity they decided to record and tour. They released one studio album, &quot;The Grand Pecking Order&quot;, and toured before disbanding in 2001. They re-united in 2006, at the Bonnaroo Music Festival. In 2016 Les tried to reunite the group, but ended up releasing an album with The Claypool Lennon Delirium. Fortunately they re-united once again in 2020 for two shows at the 1stBank Center in Broomfield, Colorado, with the rest of their tour cut short by the COVID-19 pandemic.

==== The Frog Brigade ====

In May 2000, Claypool formed Les Claypool&#x27;s Fearless Flying Frog Brigade, an experimental rock group. He was asked to put together a band for the Mountain Aire Festival in Angels Camp, California. The band &quot;of the most incredible guys (he) could possibly find&quot; debuted that Memorial Day weekend and played a number of other festivals including moe.down. Originally he was going to call the band &quot;Les Claypool&#x27;s Thunder Brigade&quot;. Claypool said:

I originally was going to do the two drummer thing with Herb and Jack Irons, so I was gonna call it the Les Claypool Thunder Brigade. Michael Bailey from Bill Graham Presents said to me that it may sound a bit too heavy for the Mountain Aire crowd and to perhaps try something a little different that had to do with the event itself. Since it was home of the Calaveras County Frog Jump... hence the Frog Brigade and then it evolved into Colonel Les Claypool&#x27;s Fearless Flying Frog Brigade.

The Primus hiatus allowed him to return to his musical roots, playing songs by bands such as Pink Floyd, King Crimson, and the Beatles. Claypool has called the Frog Brigade his &quot;mid-life crisis band&quot;. From a set of October shows recorded at Great American Music Hall in San Francisco, Claypool released two Frog Brigade live albums, one being a cover of Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Animals&quot;. The line-up included Todd Huth, Eenor, Jeff Chimenti, Jay Lane, Skerik and Claypool.

The Frog Brigade is also noted for Claypool&#x27;s being accepted into the jam band scene. &quot;Live Frogs Set 1&quot; won &quot;Best Live Album&quot; at the second annual Jammys. Jay Lane and Jeff Chimenti are both members of Bob Weir&#x27;s bands Ratdog and Wolf Bros. Claypool performed with the Rat Brigade when opening for Ratdog once in 2000 and again in 2007. The Rat Brigade includes Claypool, drummer Lane and keyboardist Chimenti, with guest appearances by saxophonist Kenny Brooks and Bob Weir.
Claypool also guested on the Ratdog sets in 2000, 2006 and 2009.

In 2002, Claypool released a studio album of the Frog Brigade, &quot;Purple Onion&quot;. Musicians on multiple tracks for &quot;Purple Onion&quot; include Warren Haynes (Gov&#x27;t Mule) Eenor, Mike Dillon, Skerik, Jay Lane, Ben Barnes, and Sam Bass (Dillon and Skerik were both from Critters Buggin; Barnes and Sam Bass were from Deadweight). The album includes &quot;Whamola&quot; which later appeared as a remix for the theme of South Park Season 10.

==== C2B3 ====

Also in 2002, Claypool collaborated with guitarist Buckethead, Parliament-Funkadelic/Talking Heads keyboardist Bernie Worrell, and former Primus drummer Bryan Mantia under the name Colonel Claypool&#x27;s Bucket of Bernie Brains (stylized &quot;C2B3,&quot; which is pronounced as &quot;C Squared, B Cubed&quot;). Their concerts pushed the improvisational envelope by preparing no material and not rehearsing beforehand. At one of their shows they prepared sandwiches onstage for the audience to eat.

C2B3 re-united in 2004 to record &quot;The Big Eyeball in the Sky&quot;, an album with equal parts instrumental and vocal songs. The band began an 18-state tour of the US on September 24, 2004. Aux TV was dismissive of Claypool&#x27;s effort, but when the tour arrived in Northern California where Claypool lives the local press gave a very positive review.

The album features only one guest, the childlike multi-instrumentalist Gabby La La (noted as Gabby Lang on Les Claypool&#x27;s Frog Brigade&#x27;s Purple Onion) on vocals and sitar. She also opened on every show (sometimes to scathingly negative reviews) during the 2004 tour as a solo act, and sometimes with members of C2B3. Claypool also produced and performed on Gabby La La&#x27;s first album, &quot;Be Careful What You Wish For...&quot;. Gabby La La is the first artist Les has signed to his label since Charlie Hunter in 1993. He has performed select shows with her (including the 2005 Bonnaroo Music Festival) and added her to his then new touring band, Les Claypool &amp; His Fancy Band. The 2005 Fancy Band line-up also included Skerik, Dillon and Lane.

At the end of 2005, Claypool released &quot;5 Gallons of Diesel&quot;, a video retrospective of all of his work away from Primus.

==== 2006 ====
===== &quot;Of Whales and Woe&quot; and the Fancy Band =====

On May 30, 2006, Claypool released a solo album, &quot;Of Whales and Woe&quot;, with guest appearances by Skerik, Mike Dillon, and Gabby La La. The album includes the song &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;, which is the theme song of the popular Adult Swim show of the same name. His son Cage and his daughter Lena even make a special appearance on the song &quot;Back Off Turkey&quot;. The release was followed by a tour of the U.S. with the following lineup:

*Les Claypool – Bass Guitar, Upright Bass, Bassjo, vocals
*Skerik – Tenor Saxophone
*Mike Dillon – Vibraphone, Percussion
*Gabby La La – Sitar, Theremin
*Paulo Baldi – Drums

The lineup is called Les Claypool&#x27;s Fancy Band and did national tours in both 2006 and 2007. A live DVD, &quot;Fancy&quot;, recorded from the 2006 tour was released in 2007. The audio track includes a mix of both soundboard and taper recordings. A song from the album, &quot;One Better&quot;, was used in National Lampoon&#x27;s TV: The Movie in a fight scene between Preston Lacy and Lee Majors.

==== 2007–2016 ====

Besides touring in the summer of 2007 nationally with the Fancy Band, Claypool performed that October with a version of the band, dubbed the Fancy Trio. The trio consisted of Claypool, Skerik on saxophone, and Mike Dillon on drums, vibraphone and percussion. They played at The Echo Project, an inaugural ecologically minded 3-day festival in Fairburn, Georgia on the Boukeart family farm. The set was similar to that of the Fancy Band&#x27;s tours, culling from Claypool&#x27; solo and Frog Brigade albums, as well containing a cover of &quot;One Step Beyond&quot; by Prince Buster and teases of other songs, including several Primus tunes, throughout their improvisational jams.

For many years Claypool has done a New Year&#x27;s Eve show at The Fillmore in San Francisco. More recently the New Year&#x27;s Eve show has been an annual New Year&#x27;s Eve Hatter&#x27;s Ball featuring a hat contest. December 31, 2007 was the 3rd such annual event.

In 2008, a United States tour spanned from February 29 to April 5. It kicked off at the Neighborhood Theatre in Charlotte, North Carolina and ended at The Warfield in San Francisco. The 2008 tour was a quartet featuring Claypool, Dillon, Skerik and Baldi.

During the year Claypool also performed several shows with Primus at festivals across America and Canada.&quot;Pig Hunt&quot; is a film directed by James Isaac released in 2008. Claypool contributes previously unreleased material and plays the role of &quot;The Preacher&quot;. He composed several songs for the Wii game &quot;Mushroom Men&quot;, released in December 2008.

On December 31, 2008, Claypool rang in the New Year with his annual New Year&#x27;s Eve show. It was at the San Francisco Opera House with Zappa Plays Zappa sharing the bill and playing first.

Claypool was also a judge for the 7th annual Independent Music Awards. His contributions helped assist upcoming independent artists&#x27; careers. His second solo album, &quot;Of Fungi and Foe&quot;, was released on March 17, 2009. The album consists of expanded material of the music from the &quot;Mushroom Men&quot; game, as well as the &quot;Pig Hunt&quot; motion picture, and features a guest appearance by Gogol Bordello&#x27;s Eugene Hutz.

In 2009, Claypool toured with Matisyahu, performing as a &#x27;double-feature&#x27; set, as well as appearing together on stage. On March 28, 2010, Claypool performed a rendition of Rush&#x27;s &quot;The Spirit of Radio&quot; for their induction into the Canadian Songwriter&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

From May 2010 to July 2013, Claypool toured extensively with Primus, alongside Larry LaLonde, and the return of former Primus drummer, Jay Lane. On September 6, 2012, a new side project was revealed as an acoustic band called Duo de Twang. Featuring Claypool and originally Marc Haggard. After two shows, Haggard was replaced with Bryan Kehoe. Both guitarists play together in the associated band &quot;M.I.R.V.&quot;

On September 25, 2013, it was announced Lane had left Primus to rejoin the Bob Weir group RatDog. Tim Alexander was named as his replacement. Claypool and &quot;Dean Ween&quot; worked together for a reality TV show called Musishermen.

On February 4, 2014, Duo de Twang released their debut album &quot;Four Foot Shack&quot; and began touring in late February. During the last part of the 2014 Spring Tour, Primus&#x27;s drummer, Tim Alexander, had a small heart attack rendering him unable to play. Luckily instead of canceling the September shows, they were able to use their close friend Danny Carey as a drummer for the late shows.

On January 19, 2016, it was announced that The Claypool Lennon Delirium, a collaboration between Claypool and Sean Lennon, would debut at Bonnaroo 2016. Claypool has spoken fondly of the collaboration, stating, &quot;Sean is a musical mutant after my own heart. He definitely reflects his genetics – not just the sensibilities of his dad, but also the abstract perspective and unique approach of his mother. It makes for a glorious freak stew.&quot;

On March 21, 2016, it was announced that the duo would release their debut album, entitled &quot;Monolith of Phobos&quot;, on June 3, 2016. Their second album, &quot;South of Reality&quot;, was released February 22, 2019.

On May 31, 2016, he was featured on the Death Grips song &quot;More Than The Fairy&quot;.

==== The Claypool Lennon Delirium ====
In 2016, Claypool formed a group with Sean Lennon of The Ghost of a Saber Tooth Tiger, Paulo Baldi of Cake, and João Nogueira of Stone Giant. Claypool met Lennon in 2015 when he was on tour with Primus, The Ghost of a Saber Tooth Tiger, and Dinosaur Jr. Claypool stayed in touch with Lennon and the group released their first album &quot;The Monolith Of Phobos&quot; in 2016. On their first tour they switched out their keyboardist Money Mark of Beastie Boys for Pete Drungle. In 2017, The Delirium returned with their EP &quot;Lime And Limpid Green&quot; and released their second album &quot;South Of Reality&quot; in 2019, this time with Nogueira on keyboards.

=== Other work ===
Claypool was a special guest star in a &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; episode with the most celebrities on Cartoon Network in 1996.

Claypool&#x27;s first book, &quot;South of the Pumphouse&quot;, was released on July 1, 2006, by Akashic Books. Copies of the book were sold during his 2006 tour of the U.S. following the release of &quot;Of Whales and Woe&quot;. The book is a dark tale of brothers, murder, drugs, and fishing; it has been likened to the work of Hunter S. Thompson. Claypool gave his first interview about the book on May 11, 2006.

Also in 2006, Claypool wrote and directed the mockumentary film &quot;Electric Apricot: Quest For Festeroo&quot;. It was shown at various film festivals and is a spoof of the jam band scene centered on the fake band Electric Apricot, with Claypool also playing the band&#x27;s drummer and backing vocalist. The band performed real shows in the California area (such as High Sierra Music Festival) for the filming of the movie. During a question and answer session at the Tiburon Film Festival, where the film debuted, he said that the DVD would have an accompanying soundtrack CD. The film has won awards including Best Feature (audience choice) at the Malibu Film Festival. Claypool also said that the band would possibly perform a few select shows, but a tour never transpired as the film&#x27;s star Adam Gates worked for Pixar, which made touring difficult.

In 2007, Claypool created Claypool Cellars, a wine-making project that turned into a boutique business. It makes wine from grapes grown in California&#x27;s Russian River Valley. The wines are named based on his music, such as &quot;Purple Pachyderm&quot; and &quot;Pink Platypus&quot;. &quot;Purple Pachyderm&quot; in particular was co-created alongside Claypool&#x27;s wife, Chaney.

== Artistry ==
Claypool is well known for his distinctive bass-playing, which aside from being dominant in the majority of his music also includes the use of several unusual techniques, such as flamenco-style strumming, tapping, slapping, and guitar-like chording. He has made prominent use of a Kahler &quot;bass tremolo&quot; vibrato system, as well as effects such as fuzz boxes and envelope filters. For most of his career, Claypool has played four-stringed basses, but has experimented with extended-range basses, most notably six-stringed models, as heard on songs like &quot;Jerry Was a Race Car Driver&quot;, which features Claypool tapping the main melody on a fretless six-string bass; Claypool noted he was &quot;getting more into the six-string&quot; during the making of &quot;Pork Soda&quot;, giving the album a heavier edge.

Claypool has cited Rush and their bassist Geddy Lee, Larry Graham, Chris Squire, Tony Levin, Roger Waters, Paul McCartney, Geezer Butler, Bootsy Collins, Stanley Clarke, John Paul Jones, and the Residents as being musical influences.

===Equipment===

Claypool has, for a long time, endorsed Carl Thompson basses, but also uses a custom &quot;Pachyderm&quot; bass built by luthier Dan Maloney, and an NS Design upright bass. He uses Mesa/Boogie amplifiers, and an extensive set of effect pedals.

== Personal life ==
Claypool is known for his eccentric personality, surreal sense of humor, and cannabis use. Claypool married his girlfriend, Chaney Smith, in December 1995. They have two children.

&quot;Les Claypool Day&quot; was declared in Cincinnati by mayor John Cranley on June 12, 2018. The declaration was presented to Claypool during Primus&#x27; show that night at the Riverbend Music Center by members of the Cincinnati USA Music Heritage Foundation alongside Claypool&#x27;s friend, influence, and Cincinnati native Bootsy Collins.

<doc id="52778" wikidata="Q410185" url="?curid=52778" title="Sodium cyanide">
<text>Sodium cyanide is a compound with the formula NaCN and the structure . It is a white, water-soluble solid. Cyanide has a high affinity for metals, which leads to the high toxicity of this salt. Its main application, in gold mining, also exploits its high reactivity toward metals. It is a moderately strong base. 

==Production and chemical properties==

Sodium cyanide is produced by treating hydrogen cyanide with sodium hydroxide:
Worldwide production was estimated at 500,000 tons in the year 2006. Formerly it was prepared by the Castner process involving the reaction of sodium amide with carbon at elevated temperatures.

The structure of solid NaCN is related to that of sodium chloride. The anions and cations are each six-coordinate. Potassium cyanide (KCN) adopts a similar structure. 

When treated with acid, it forms the toxic gas hydrogen cyanide:

Because the salt is derived from a weak acid, sodium cyanide readily reverts to HCN by hydrolysis; the moist solid emits small amounts of hydrogen cyanide, which is thought to smell like bitter almonds (not everyone can smell it—the ability thereof is due to a genetic trait). Sodium cyanide reacts rapidly with strong acids to release hydrogen cyanide. This dangerous process represents a significant risk associated with cyanide salts. It is detoxified most efficiently with hydrogen peroxide () to produce sodium cyanate (NaOCN) and water:

==Applications==
===Cyanide mining===

Gold cyanidation (also known as the cyanide process) is the dominant technique for extracting gold, much of which is obtained from low-grade ore. More than 70% of cyanide consumption globally is used for this purpose. The application exploits the high affinity of gold(I) for cyanide, which induces gold metal to oxidize and dissolve in the presence of air (oxygen) and water, producing the salt sodium dicyanoaurate (or sodium gold cyanide) ():

A similar process uses potassium cyanide (KCN, a close relative of sodium cyanide) to produce potassium dicyanoaurate ().

===Chemical feedstock===
Several commercially significant chemical compounds are derived from cyanide, including cyanuric chloride, cyanogen chloride, and many nitriles. In organic synthesis, cyanide, which is classified as a strong nucleophile, is used to prepare nitriles, which occur widely in many chemicals, including pharmaceuticals. Illustrative is the synthesis of benzyl cyanide by the reaction of benzyl chloride and sodium cyanide.

===Niche uses===
Being highly toxic, sodium cyanide is used to kill or stun rapidly such as in collecting jars used by entomologists and in widely illegal cyanide fishing.

It was used as an insecticide, rodenticide and antibacterial, but these uses were cancelled by the EPA in 1987.

==Toxicity==

Sodium cyanide, like other soluble cyanide salts, is among the most rapidly acting of all known poisons. NaCN is a potent inhibitor of respiration, acting on mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase and hence blocking electron transport. This results in decreased oxidative metabolism and oxygen utilization. Lactic acidosis then occurs as a consequence of anaerobic metabolism. An oral dosage as small as 200–300 mg can be fatal.
