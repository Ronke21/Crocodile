<text>French Equatorial Africa (, or AEF) was a federation of French colonial territories in Equatorial Africa which consisted of Gabon, French Congo, Ubangi-Shari, and Chad. It existed from 1910 to 1958 and its administration was based in Brazzaville.

==History==
Established in 1910, the Federation contained four colonial possessions: French Gabon, French Congo, Ubangi-Shari and French Chad. The Governor-General was based in Brazzaville with deputies in each territory.

In 1911, France ceded parts of the territory to German Kamerun as a result of the Agadir Crisis. The territory was returned after Germany&#x27;s defeat in World War I, while most of Cameroon proper became a French League of Nations mandate not integrated into the AEF.

French Equatorial Africa, especially the region of Ubangi-Shari, had a similar concession system as the Congo Free State and similar atrocities were also committed there. Writer André Gide traveled to Ubangi-Shari and was told by inhabitants about atrocities including mutilations, dismemberments, executions, the burning of children, and villagers being forcibly bound to large beams and made to walk until dropping from exhaustion and thirst. Gide&#x27;s book &quot;Travels in the Congo&quot;, published in 1927, was fiercely critical of the system of the concession companies in French Equatorial Africa. The book had an important impact on the anti-colonialist movement in France. The number of victims under the French concession system in Ubangi-Shari and other parts of French Equatorial Africa remains unknown. Adam Hochschild estimates a population decrease of half in the French Congo and Gabon, similar to his estimate of the population decline in the Congo Free State.

In French Equatorial Africa, the French authorities long tolerated indigenous slavery, but finally acted against the slave trade of the Sultan of Dar Kuti in 1908, and took action against his slave raids in 1911, declaring the slaves in Dar al Kuti free. 

During the late 1920s and early 1930s an anti-colonial movement &quot;Société Amicale des Originaires de l&#x27;A.E.F.&quot; was established by André Matsoua, seeking French citizenship for the territory&#x27;s inhabitants.

During World War II, French Cameroun and the entirety of the AEF except for Gabon rallied to the Free French Forces in August 1940, Gabon instead remained loyal to Vichy France until 12 November 1940 when the Vichy administration withdrew following the Battle of Gabon. The federation became the strategic centre of Free French activities in Africa. Félix Eboué was installed as Governor-General of AEF. A separate administrative structure was established under the auspices of Free French Africa grouping both AEF and Cameroun.

Under the Fourth Republic (1946–58), the federation was represented in the French parliament. When the territories voted in the September 1958 referendum to become autonomous within the French Community, the federation was dissolved. In 1959 the new republics formed an interim association called the Union of Central African Republics, before becoming fully independent in August 1960.

==Administration==
French Equatorial Africa began with the concept of association, which was implemented through treaties promising French protection by the Italian-French explorer Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza during the mid-1800s, who convinced indigenous communities to cooperate with the French in exchange for greater trade opportunities. This association eventually led to French indirect rule in the region. However, France&#x27;s attempts at indirect rule faced consistent resistance from local leaders.

The AEF was perceived by France as an unstable colony. Therefore, France granted private companies contracts for the exploitation of natural resources like ivory and rubber, rather than sustainable investment. Private companies implemented heavy taxation with little to no pay and cruel treatment towards workers and the local communities.

In 1908 French Equatorial Africa was divided into four colonies in hopes of strengthening French authority within the region. Until 1934, French Equatorial Africa was a federation of French colonies like French West Africa. That year, however, the AEF became a unitary entity, its constituent colonies becoming known as regions, and later became known as territories in 1937. There was a single budget for the unified colony; prior to unification, each member had had its own finances. 

As of 1942, the AEF was administered by a governor-general, who had &quot;the supreme direction of all services, both civil and military.&quot; However, the difference in numbers between administrators and the local populace made it difficult for the French to exercise power outside of their headquarters without voluntary or involuntary indigenous cooperation. Additionally, the governor-general&#x27;s power was limited in practice by France&#x27;s centralizing colonial policy. &quot;Most important legislation is enacted in Paris,&quot; wrote the authors of the 1942 British naval intelligence handbook for the colony, &quot;whilst the governor-general fills in minor details and penalties.&quot; The governor-general was assisted by a consultative council of administration (&quot;Conseil d&#x27;Administration&quot;) composed of important local officials and some members, both African and European, elected indirectly. All major administration positions were appointed by French government and were not accountable to officials elected by the African people. Additionally, France held complete control over diplomacy, defense, and politics.

Under the unified colony, three of the constituent territories, Chad, Gabon, and Ubangi-Shari, were administered by a governor, while Moyen-Congo was under the purview of the governor-general. Each had a council of local interests (&quot;Conseil des Intérêts Locaux&quot;) similar to the council of administration. Locally, the territories were subdivided into &quot;départements&quot; and subdivisions overseen by appointed officials. The only municipalities were the capitals of the territories, which were classified as &quot;communes mixtes&quot; as opposed to Senegal&#x27;s &quot;communes de plein exercice&quot;, which had democratically elected councils. Although these municipalities possessed certain powers of local self-government, their mayors and councils—which included African representatives—were appointed.

==Geography==
Accounting for a little less than an eighth of Africa, across modern day Central African Republic, Republic of Chad, Republic of the Congo, Republic of Gabon, and most of Cameroon, the greater part of French Equatorial Africa extended over a granite plateau, framed by the Tibesti, Ouadaï, and Fertit massifs to the northeast, Darfur to the east and the Crystal mountains and Mayombe in the southwest. Two basins occupied the central and southern parts of the territory: the basin of Chad, a former inland sea of which Lake Chad is a remnant, and the basin of Congo, traversed by the river of the same name and its main tributaries (Oubangui River, Sangha River, and Alima River). A coastal plain stretched from mainland Spanish Guinea (now Equatorial Guinea) to the Congo River. The highest point in French Equatorial Africa was Mount Emi Koussi (3,415 meters) in Tibesti.

Due to the very size of the territory, the climate varied extremely from one point to another, going from a particularly arid Saharan climate in the north to a humid tropical climate in the southern part. The vegetation was affected by these differences: in the north, the virtual absence of rain made it nearly impossible for vegetation to develop, apart from a few thorny shrubs; in the center lay the domain of the savannahs, where millet, peanuts and cassava were grown; finally to the south were the humid tropical forests, from which various species such as ebony and okoumé were taken. In the coastal regions, vanilla, cocoa and coffee trees were grown. 

French Equatorial Africa was bounded by British Nigeria, French West Africa, Italian Libya, Anglo-Egyptian Sudan and the Belgian Congo. To the west, it bordered the Atlantic Ocean.

Territories:
*French Chad
*Ubangi-Shari
*French Congo
*French Gabon

==Postage stamps==

The postal administrations of the four territories were separate until 1936, each issuing its own stamps. In that year, stamps of Gabon and Middle Congo were overprinted . A definitive series for the colony followed in 1937, featuring local scenes and key French figures in the formation of the colony, with various color and value changes each year through 1940.

The 1937 series was overprinted or just in 1940 by the Free French, and in 1941 they issued a series depicting a phoenix rising from the flames.

A new definitive series, featuring local scenery and people, was issued in 1946, and another twenty-odd stamps came out during the 1950s, with the last being the omnibus Human Rights issue on 10 December 1958.

<text>In the mathematical discipline of general topology, Stone–Čech compactification (or Čech–Stone compactification) is a technique for constructing a universal map from a topological space &quot;X&quot; to a compact Hausdorff space &quot;βX&quot;. The Stone–Čech compactification &quot;βX&quot; of a topological space &quot;X&quot; is the largest, most general compact Hausdorff space &quot;generated&quot; by &quot;X&quot;, in the sense that any continuous map from &quot;X&quot; to a compact Hausdorff space factors through &quot;βX&quot; (in a unique way). If &quot;X&quot; is a Tychonoff space then the map from &quot;X&quot; to its image in &quot;βX&quot; is a homeomorphism, so &quot;X&quot; can be thought of as a (dense) subspace of &quot;βX&quot;; every other compact Hausdorff space that densely contains &quot;X&quot; is a quotient of &quot;βX&quot;. For general topological spaces &quot;X&quot;, the map from &quot;X&quot; to &quot;βX&quot; need not be injective.

A form of the axiom of choice is required to prove that every topological space has a Stone–Čech compactification. Even for quite simple spaces &quot;X&quot;, an accessible concrete description of &quot;βX&quot; often remains elusive. In particular, proofs that &quot;βX&quot; \ &quot;X&quot; is nonempty do not give an explicit description of any particular point in &quot;βX&quot; \ &quot;X&quot;.

The Stone–Čech compactification occurs implicitly in a paper by and was given explicitly by and .

== History ==

Andrey Nikolayevich Tikhonov introduced completely regular spaces in 1930 in order to avoid the pathological situation of Hausdorff spaces whose only continuous real-valued functions are constant maps.

In the same 1930 article where Tychonoff defined completely regular spaces, he also proved that every Tychonoff space (i.e. Hausdorff completely regular space) has a Hausdorff compactification (in this same article, he also proved Tychonoff&#x27;s theorem). 
In 1937, Čech extended Tychonoff&#x27;s technique and introduced the notation β&quot;X&quot; for this compactification. 
Stone also constructed β&quot;X&quot; in a 1937 article, although using a very different method. 
Despite Tychonoff&#x27;s article being the first work on the subject of the Stone–Čech compactification and despite Tychonoff&#x27;s article being referenced by both Stone and Čech, Tychonoff&#x27;s name is rarely associated with β&quot;X&quot;.

== Universal property and functoriality ==

The Stone–Čech compactification of the topological space &quot;X&quot; is a compact Hausdorff space &quot;βX&quot; together with a continuous map &quot;iX&quot; : &quot;X&quot; → &quot;βX&quot; that has the following universal property: any continuous map &quot;f&quot; : &quot;X&quot; → &quot;K&quot;, where &quot;K&quot; is a compact Hausdorff space, extends uniquely to a continuous map &quot;βf&quot; : &quot;βX&quot; → &quot;K&quot;, i.e. (&quot;βf&quot;)&quot;iX&quot; = &quot;f&quot;.

As is usual for universal properties, this universal property characterizes &quot;βX&quot; up to homeomorphism.

As is outlined in , below, one can prove (using the axiom of choice) that such a Stone–Čech compactification &quot;iX&quot; : &quot;X&quot; → &quot;βX&quot; exists for every topological space &quot;X&quot;. Furthermore, the image &quot;iX&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) is dense in &quot;βX&quot;.

Some authors add the assumption that the starting space &quot;X&quot; be Tychonoff (or even locally compact Hausdorff), for the following reasons:
*The map from &quot;X&quot; to its image in &quot;βX&quot; is a homeomorphism if and only if &quot;X&quot; is Tychonoff. 
*The map from &quot;X&quot; to its image in &quot;βX&quot; is a homeomorphism to an open subspace if and only if &quot;X&quot; is locally compact Hausdorff.
The Stone–Čech construction can be performed for more general spaces &quot;X&quot;, but in that case the map &quot;X&quot; → &quot;βX&quot; need not be a homeomorphism to the image of &quot;X&quot; (and sometimes is not even injective).

As is usual for universal constructions like this, the extension property makes &quot;β&quot; a functor from Top (the category of topological spaces) to CHaus (the category of compact Hausdorff spaces). Further, if we let &quot;U&quot; be the inclusion functor from CHaus into Top, maps from &quot;βX&quot; to &quot;K&quot; (for &quot;K&quot; in CHaus) correspond bijectively to maps from &quot;X&quot; to &quot;UK&quot; (by considering their restriction to &quot;X&quot; and using the universal property of &quot;βX&quot;). i.e. 
:Hom(&quot;βX&quot;, &quot;K&quot;) ≅ Hom(&quot;X&quot;, &quot;UK&quot;), 
which means that &quot;β&quot; is left adjoint to &quot;U&quot;. This implies that CHaus is a reflective subcategory of Top with reflector &quot;β&quot;.

== Examples ==
If &quot;X&quot; is a compact Hausdorff space, then it coincides with its Stone–Čech compactification.

The Stone–Čech compactification of the first uncountable ordinal formula_1, with the order topology, is the ordinal formula_2. The Stone–Čech compactification of the deleted Tychonoff plank is the Tychonoff plank.

==Constructions==

===Construction using products===
One attempt to construct the Stone–Čech compactification of &quot;X&quot; is to take the closure of the image of &quot;X&quot; in

:formula_3

where the product is over all maps from &quot;X&quot; to compact Hausdorff spaces &quot;K&quot; (or, equivalently, the image of &quot;X&quot; by the right Kan extension of the identity functor of the category &quot;CHaus&quot; of compact Hausdorff spaces along the inclusion functor of &quot;CHaus&quot; into the category &quot;Top&quot; of general topological spaces). By Tychonoff&#x27;s theorem this product of compact spaces is compact, and the closure of &quot;X&quot; in this space is therefore also compact. This works intuitively but fails for the technical reason that the collection of all such maps is a proper class rather than a set. There are several ways to modify this idea to make it work; for example, one can restrict the compact Hausdorff spaces &quot;K&quot; to have underlying set &quot;P&quot;(&quot;P&quot;(&quot;X&quot;)) (the power set of the power set of &quot;X&quot;), which is sufficiently large that it has cardinality at least equal to that of every compact Hausdorff space to which &quot;X&quot; can be mapped with dense image.

===Construction using the unit interval===
One way of constructing &quot;βX&quot; is to let &quot;C&quot; be the set of all continuous functions from &quot;X&quot; into [0, 1] and consider the map formula_4 where 

:formula_5

This may be seen to be a continuous map onto its image, if [0, 1]&quot;C&quot; is given the product topology. By Tychonoff&#x27;s theorem we have that [0, 1]&quot;C&quot; is compact since [0, 1] is. Consequently, the closure of &quot;X&quot; in [0, 1]&quot;C&quot; is a compactification of &quot;X&quot;.

In fact, this closure is the Stone–Čech compactification. To verify this, we just need to verify that the closure satisfies the appropriate universal property. We do this first for &quot;K&quot; = [0, 1], where the desired extension of &quot;f&quot; : &quot;X&quot; → [0, 1] is just the projection onto the &quot;f&quot; coordinate in [0, 1]&quot;C&quot;. In order to then get this for general compact Hausdorff &quot;K&quot; we use the above to note that &quot;K&quot; can be embedded in some cube, extend each of the coordinate functions and then take the product of these extensions.

The special property of the unit interval needed for this construction to work is that it is a &quot;cogenerator&quot; of the category of compact Hausdorff spaces: this means that if &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are compact Hausdorff spaces, and &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are distinct maps from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot;, then there is a map &quot;h&quot; : &quot;B&quot; → [0, 1] such that &quot;hf&quot; and &quot;hg&quot; are distinct. Any other cogenerator (or cogenerating set) can be used in this construction.

===Construction using ultrafilters===
Alternatively, if formula_6 is discrete, then it is possible to construct formula_7 as the set of all ultrafilters on formula_8 with the elements of formula_6 corresponding to the principal ultrafilters. The topology on the set of ultrafilters, known as the , is generated by sets of the form formula_10 for formula_11 a subset of formula_12

Again we verify the universal property: For formula_13 with formula_14 compact Hausdorff and formula_15 an ultrafilter on formula_6 we have an ultrafilter base formula_17 on formula_18 the pushforward of formula_19 This has a unique limit because formula_14 is compact Hausdorff, say formula_21 and we define formula_22 This may be verified to be a continuous extension of formula_23

Equivalently, one can take the Stone space of the complete Boolean algebra of all subsets of formula_6 as the Stone–Čech compactification. This is really the same construction, as the Stone space of this Boolean algebra is the set of ultrafilters (or equivalently prime ideals, or homomorphisms to the 2-element Boolean algebra) of the Boolean algebra, which is the same as the set of ultrafilters on formula_12

The construction can be generalized to arbitrary Tychonoff spaces by using maximal filters of zero sets instead of ultrafilters. (Filters of closed sets suffice if the space is normal.)

===Construction using C*-algebras===
The Stone–Čech compactification is naturally homeomorphic to the spectrum of Cb(&quot;X&quot;). Here Cb(&quot;X&quot;) denotes the C*-algebra of all continuous bounded complex-valued functions on &quot;X&quot; with sup-norm. Notice that Cb(&quot;X&quot;) is canonically isomorphic to the multiplier algebra of C0(&quot;X&quot;).

==The Stone–Čech compactification of the natural numbers==
In the case where &quot;X&quot; is locally compact, e.g. N or R, the image of &quot;X&quot; forms an open subset of &quot;βX&quot;, or indeed of any compactification, (this is also a necessary condition, as an open subset of a compact Hausdorff space is locally compact). In this case one often studies the remainder of the space, &quot;βX&quot; \ &quot;X&quot;. This is a closed subset of &quot;βX&quot;, and so is compact. We consider N with its discrete topology and write &quot;β&quot;N \ N = N* (but this does not appear to be standard notation for general &quot;X&quot;).

As explained above, one can view &quot;β&quot;N as the set of ultrafilters on N, with the topology generated by sets of the form formula_10 for &quot;U&quot; a subset of N. The set N corresponds to the set of principal ultrafilters, and the set N* to the set of free ultrafilters.

The study of &quot;β&quot;N, and in particular N*, is a major area of modern set-theoretic topology. The major results motivating this are Parovicenko&#x27;s theorems, essentially characterising its behaviour under the assumption of the continuum hypothesis.

These state:

* Every compact Hausdorff space of weight at most formula_27 (see Aleph number) is the continuous image of N* (this does not need the continuum hypothesis, but is less interesting in its absence).
* If the continuum hypothesis holds then N* is the unique Parovicenko space, up to isomorphism.

These were originally proved by considering Boolean algebras and applying Stone duality.

Jan van Mill has described &quot;βN as a &quot;three headed monster&quot;—the three heads being a smiling and friendly head (the behaviour under the assumption of the continuum hypothesis), the ugly head of independence which constantly tries to confuse you (determining what behaviour is possible in different models of set theory), and the third head is the smallest of all (what you can prove about it in ZFC). It has relatively recently been observed that this characterisation isn&#x27;t quite right—there is in fact a fourth head of &quot;βN, in which forcing axioms and Ramsey type axioms give properties of &quot;β&quot;N almost diametrically opposed to those under the continuum hypothesis, giving very few maps from N* indeed. Examples of these axioms include the combination of Martin&#x27;s axiom and the Open colouring axiom which, for example, prove that (N*)2 ≠ N*, while the continuum hypothesis implies the opposite.

=== An application: the dual space of the space of bounded sequences of reals ===
The Stone–Čech compactification &quot;β&quot;N can be used to characterize formula_28 (the Banach space of all bounded sequences in the scalar field R or C, with supremum norm) and its dual space.

Given a bounded sequence formula_29 there exists a closed ball &quot;B&quot; in the scalar field that contains the image of formula_30. formula_30 is then a function from N to &quot;B&quot;. Since N is discrete and &quot;B&quot; is compact and Hausdorff, &quot;a&quot; is continuous. According to the universal property, there exists a unique extension &quot;βa&quot; : &quot;β&quot;N → &quot;B&quot;. This extension does not depend on the ball &quot;B&quot; we consider.

We have defined an extension map from the space of bounded scalar valued sequences to the space of continuous functions over &quot;β&quot;N.

:formula_32

This map is bijective since every function in &quot;C&quot;(&quot;β&quot;N) must be bounded and can then be restricted to a bounded scalar sequence.

If we further consider both spaces with the sup norm the extension map becomes an isometry. Indeed, if in the construction above we take the smallest possible ball &quot;B&quot;, we see that the sup norm of the extended sequence does not grow (although the image of the extended function can be bigger).

Thus, formula_28 can be identified with &quot;C&quot;(&quot;βN). This allows us to use the Riesz representation theorem and find that the dual space of formula_28 can be identified with the space of finite Borel measures on &quot;βN.

Finally, it should be noticed that this technique generalizes to the &quot;L&quot;∞ space of an arbitrary measure space &quot;X&quot;. However, instead of simply considering the space &quot;βX&quot; of ultrafilters on &quot;X&quot;, the right way to generalize this construction is to consider the Stone space &quot;Y&quot; of the measure algebra of &quot;X&quot;: the spaces &quot;C&quot;(&quot;Y&quot;) and &quot;L&quot;∞(&quot;X&quot;) are isomorphic as C*-algebras as long as &quot;X&quot; satisfies a reasonable finiteness condition (that any set of positive measure contains a subset of finite positive measure).

===A monoid operation on the Stone–Čech compactification of the naturals===
The natural numbers form a monoid under addition. It turns out that this operation can be extended (generally in more than one way, but uniquely under a further condition) to &quot;β&quot;N, turning this space also into a monoid, though rather surprisingly a non-commutative one.

For any subset, &quot;A&quot;, of N and a positive integer &quot;n&quot; in N, we define

:formula_35

Given two ultrafilters &quot;F&quot; and &quot;G&quot; on N, we define their sum by 

:formula_36

it can be checked that this is again an ultrafilter, and that the operation + is associative (but not commutative) on βN and extends the addition on N; 0 serves as a neutral element for the operation + on &quot;β&quot;N. The operation is also right-continuous, in the sense that for every ultrafilter &quot;F&quot;, the map

:formula_37

is continuous.

More generally, if &quot;S&quot; is a semigroup with the discrete topology, the operation of &quot;S&quot; can be extended to &quot;βS&quot;, getting a right-continuous associative operation.

<text>Spread betting is any of various types of wagering on the outcome of an event where the pay-off is based on the accuracy of the wager, rather than a simple &quot;win or lose&quot; outcome, such as fixed-odds (or money-line) betting or parimutuel betting.

A point spread is a range of outcomes and the bet is whether the outcome will be above or below the spread. , spread betting was a major growth market in the UK, with the number of gamblers heading towards one million. Financial spread betting (see below) can carry a high level of risk if there is no &quot;stop&quot;. In the UK, financial spread betting is regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority rather than the Gambling Commission who regulate spread betting on sports.

==Purpose==
The general purpose of spread betting is to create an active market for both sides of a binary wager, even if the outcome of an event may appear &quot;prima facie&quot; to be biased towards one side or the other. In sports, almost every contest has a &quot;favorite&quot; and an &quot;underdog&quot;, most obviously when a historically strong team is playing a weaker team. If the wager is simply &quot;Will the favorite win?&quot;, more bets are likely to be made for the favorite, possibly to such an extent that there would be very few betters willing to take the underdog.

The point spread is essentially a handicap towards the underdog. The wager becomes &quot;Will the favorite win by more than the point spread?&quot; The point spread can be moved to any level to create an equal number of participants on each side of the wager. This allows a bookmaker to act as a market maker by accepting wagers on both sides of the spread. The bookmaker charges a commission, or &quot;vigorish&quot;, and acts as the counterparty for each participant. As long as the total amount wagered on each side is roughly equal, the bookmaker is unconcerned with the actual outcome; profits instead come from the commissions.

Because the spread is intended to create an equal number of wagers on either side, the implied probability is 50% for both sides of the wager. To profit, the bookmaker must pay one side (or both sides) less than this notional amount. In practice, spreads may be perceived as slightly favoring one side, and bookmakers often revise their odds to manage their event risk.

One important assumption is that to be credited with a win, either team only needs to win by the minimum of the rules of the game (&quot;i.e.&quot;, 1 point), without regard to the margin of victory. This presumes that winning teams never unnecessarily extend a winning margin—and losing teams never uselessly narrow an inevitable loss. In other words, each team is only playing to win rather than to beat the point spread.

This assumption does not necessarily hold in all situations. For example, at the end of a season, the total points scored by a team can affect future events such as playoff seeding and positioning for the amateur draft; winning teams may &quot;run up&quot; the score, and losing teams may bench their starters in favor of developing less-experienced players for the future. 

In virtually all sports, players and other on-field contributors are forbidden from being involved in sports betting and thus have no incentive to consider the point spread during play; any attempt to manipulate the outcome of a game for gambling purposes would be considered match fixing. The lack of tolerance for athletes and coaching staff engaging in this practice is so serious that the penalty is typically a lifetime banishment from the sport.

==Spreads in sports wagering (U.S.)==
Spread betting was invented by Charles K. McNeil, a mathematics teacher from Connecticut who became a bookmaker in Chicago in the 1940s. In North America, the gambler usually wagers that the difference between the scores of two teams will be less than or greater than the value specified by the bookmaker, with even money for either option. An example:
* The bookmaker advertises a spread of 4 points in a certain game;
** If the gamblers bet on the &quot;underdog&quot;, they are said to &quot;take the points&quot; and will win if the underdog&#x27;s score plus the spread is greater than the favorite&#x27;s score.
*** The eventual score is Underdog 8, Favorite 10: 8 + 4 &gt; 10, so the gambler wins;
*** The eventual score is Underdog 8, Favorite 13: 8 + 4 &lt; 13, so the gambler loses.
** If the gamblers bet on the &quot;favorite&quot;, they &quot;give the points&quot; (sometimes called &quot;lay the points&quot;) and will win if the favorite&#x27;s score minus the spread is greater than the underdog&#x27;s score:
*** The eventual score is Underdog 5, Favorite 10: 10 – 4 &gt; 5, so the gambler wins;
*** The eventual score is Underdog 8, Favorite 10: 10 – 4 &lt; 8, so the gambler loses.
** Ties aka &quot;Push&quot;
*** The eventual score is Underdog 9, Favorite 13: 9 + 4 = 13, so the gambler ties &quot;pushes&quot;. The reverse is also the same the gambler takes the favorite and it is 13 - 4 = 9

Spreads are frequently, though not always, specified in half-point fractions to eliminate the possibility of a tie, known as a &quot;push&quot;. In the event of a push, the game is considered &quot;no action&quot;, and no money is won or lost. However, this is not a desirable outcome for the sports book, as they are forced to refund every bet, and although both the book and its bettors will be even, if the cost of overhead is taken into account, the book has actually lost money by taking bets on the event. Sports books are generally permitted to state &quot;ties win&quot; or &quot;ties lose&quot; to avoid the necessity of refunding every bet.

Betting on sporting events has long been the most popular form of spread betting. Whilst most bets the casino offers to players have a built in house edge, betting on the spread offers an opportunity for the astute gambler. When a casino accepts a spread bet, it gives the player the odds of 10 to 11, or -110. That means that for every 11 dollars the player wagers, the player will win 10, slightly lower than an even money bet. If team A is playing team B, the casino is not concerned with who wins the game; they are only concerned with taking an equal amount of money of both sides. For example, if one player takes team A and the other takes team B and each wager $110 to win $100, it doesn&#x27;t matter what team wins; the casino makes money. They take $100 of the $110 from the losing bet and pay the winner, keeping the extra $10 for themselves. This is the house edge. The goal of the casino is to set a line that encourages an equal amount of action on both sides, thereby guaranteeing a profit. This also explains how money can be made by the astute gambler. If casinos set lines to encourage an equal amount of money on both sides, it sets them based on the public perception of the team, not necessarily the real strength of the teams. Many things can affect public perception, which moves the line away from what the real line should be. This gap between the Vegas line, the real line, and differences between other sports books betting lines and spreads is where value can be found.

A &quot;teaser&quot; is a bet that alters the spread in the gambler&#x27;s favor by a predetermined margin – in American football the teaser margin is often six points. For example, if the line is 3.5 points and bettors want to place a teaser bet on the underdog, they take 9.5 points instead; a teaser bet on the favorite would mean that the gambler takes 2.5 points instead of having to give the 3.5. In return for the additional points, the payout if the gambler wins is less than even money, or the gambler must wager on more than one event and both events must win. In this way it is very similar to a parlay. At some establishments, the &quot;reverse teaser&quot; also exists, which alters the spread against the gambler, who gets paid at more than evens if the bet wins.

== Sports spread betting ==
In the United Kingdom, sports spread betting became popular in the late 1980s by offering an alternative form of sports wagering to traditional fixed odds, or fixed-risk, betting. With fixed odds betting, a gambler places a fixed-risk stake on stated fractional or decimal odds on the outcome of a sporting event that would give a known return for that outcome occurring or a known loss if that outcome doesn&#x27;t occur (the initial stake). With sports spread betting, gamblers are instead betting on whether a specified outcome in a sports event will end up being above or below a ‘spread’ offered by a sports spread betting firm, with profits or losses determined by how much above or below the spread the final outcome finishes at.

The spread on offer will refer to the betting firm&#x27;s prediction on the range of a final outcome for a particular occurrence in a sports event, e.g., the total number of goals to be scored in a football (US: soccer) match, the number of runs to be scored by a team in a cricket match or the number of lengths between the winner and second-placed finisher in a horse race.

The gambler can elect to ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ on the spread depending on whether they think the final outcome will be higher than the top end of the spread on offer, or lower than the bottom end of the spread. The more right the gambler is then the more they will win, but the more wrong the byy are then the more they can lose.

The level of the gambler&#x27;s profit or loss will be determined by the stake size selected for the bet, multiplied by the number of unit points above or below the gambler&#x27;s bet level. This reflects the fundamental difference between sports spread betting and fixed odds sports betting in that both the level of winnings and level of losses are not fixed and can end up being many multiples of the original stake size selected.

For example, in a cricket match a sports spread betting firm may list the spread of a team&#x27;s predicted runs at 340 – 350. The gambler can elect to ‘buy’ at 350 if they think the team will score more than 350 runs in total, or sell at 340 if they think the team will score less than 340. If the gambler elects to buy at 350 and the team scores 400 runs in total, the gambler will have won 50 unit points multiplied by their initial stake. But if the team only scores 300 runs then the gambler will have lost 50 unit points multiplied by their initial stake.

It is important to note the difference between spreads in sports wagering in the U.S. and sports spread betting in the UK. In the U.S. betting on the spread is effectively still a fixed risk bet on a line offered by the bookmaker with a known return if the gambler correctly bets with either the underdog or the favourite on the line offered and a known loss if the gambler incorrectly bets on the line. In the UK betting above or below the spread does not have a known final profit or loss, with these figures determined by the number of unit points the level of the final outcome ends up being either above or below the spread, multiplied by the stake chosen by the gambler.

For UK spread betting firms, any final outcome that finishes in the middle of the spread will result in profits from both sides of the book as both buyers and sellers will have ended up making unit point losses. So in the example above, if the cricket team ended up scoring 345 runs both buyers at 350 and sellers at 340 would have ended up with losses of five unit points multiplied by their stake.

==Bets on the total (over/under)==
In addition to the spread bet, a very common &quot;side bet&quot; on an event is the &quot;total&quot; (commonly called the &quot;over/under&quot; or &quot;O/U&quot;) bet. This is a bet on the total number of points scored by both teams. Suppose team A is playing team B and the total is set at 44.5 points. If the final score is team A 24, team B 17, the total is 41 and bettors who took the &quot;under&quot; will win. If the final score is team A 30, team B 31, the total is 61 and bettors who took the &quot;over&quot; will win. The total is popular because it allows gamblers to bet on their overall perception of the game (e.g., a high-scoring offensive show or a defensive battle) without needing to pick the actual winner.

In the UK, these bets are sometimes called spread bets, but rather than a simple win/loss, the bet pays more or less depending on how far from the spread the final result is.

Example: In a football match the bookmaker believes that 12 or 13 corners will occur, thus the spread is set at 12–13.
* A gambler believes that there will be more than 13 corners, and &quot;buys&quot; at £25 a point at 13.
** If the number of corners is 16, the gambler &quot;wins&quot; (16–13) = 3 x £25.
** If the number of corners is 10, the gambler &quot;loses&quot; (13–10) = 3 x £25.
* A &quot;sell&quot; transaction is similar except that it is made against the &quot;bottom&quot; value of the spread.
* Often &quot;live pricing&quot; changes the spread during the course of an event, increasing a profit or minimizing a loss.

In North American sports betting many of these wagers would be classified as &quot;over-under&quot; (or, more commonly today, &quot;total&quot;) bets rather than spread bets. However, these are for one side or another of a total only, and do not increase the amount won or lost as the actual moves away from the bookmaker&#x27;s prediction. Instead, over-under or total bets are handled much like &quot;point-spread&quot; bets on a team, with the usual 10/11 (4.55%) commission applied. Many Nevada sports books allow these bets in parlays, just like team point spread bets. This makes it possible to bet, for instance, &quot;team A and the over&quot;, and be paid if &quot;both&quot; 
: team A &quot;covers&quot; the point spread (wins by that amount or more) 
&quot;and&quot; 
: the total score is higher than the book&#x27;s prediction.
(Such parlays usually pay off at odds of 13:5 with no commission charge, just as a standard two-team parlay would.)

==Mathematics==
The mathematical analysis of spreads and spread betting is a large and growing subject. For example, sports that have simple 1-point scoring systems (&quot;e.g.,&quot; baseball, hockey, and soccer) may be analysed using Poisson and Skellam statistics.

==Financial spread betting==
By far the largest part of the official market in the UK concerns financial instruments; the leading spread-betting companies make most of their revenues from financial markets, their sports operations being much less significant. Financial spread betting in the United Kingdom closely resembles the futures and options markets, the major differences being
* the &quot;charge&quot; occurs through a wider bid–ask spread;
* spread betting has a different tax regime compared with securities and futures exchanges (see below);
* spread betting is more flexible since it is not limited to exchange hours or definitions, can create new instruments relatively easily (e.g. individual stock futures), and may have guaranteed stop losses (see below); and
* the trading is off-exchange, with the contract existing directly between the market-making company and the client, rather than exchange-cleared, and is thus subject to a lower level of regulation.

Financial spread betting is a way to speculate on financial markets in the same way as trading a number of derivatives. In particular, the financial derivative contract for difference (CFD) mirrors the spread bet in many ways. In fact, a number of financial derivative trading companies offer both financial spread bets and CFDs in parallel using the same trading platform.

Unlike fixed-odds betting, the amount won or lost can be unlimited as there is no single stake to limit any loss. However, it is usually possible to negotiate limits with the bookmaker:
* A &quot;stop loss&quot; or &quot;stop&quot; automatically closes the bet if the spread moves against the gambler by a specified amount.
* A &quot;stop win&quot;, &quot;limit&quot; or &quot;take profit&quot; closes the bet when the spread moves in a gambler&#x27;s favor by a specified amount.

Spread betting has moved outside the ambit of sport and financial markets (that is, those dealing solely with share, bonds and derivatives), to cover a wide range of markets, such as house prices. 

===Tax treatment===
In the UK and some other European countries the profit from spread betting is free from tax. The tax authorities of these countries designate financial spread betting as gambling and not investing, meaning it is free from capital gains tax and stamp duty, despite the fact that it is regulated as a financial product by the Financial Conduct Authority in the UK. Most traders are also not liable for income tax unless they rely solely on their profits from financial spread betting to support themselves. The popularity of financial spread betting in the UK and some other European countries, compared to trading other speculative financial instruments such as CFDs and futures is partly due to this tax advantage. However, this also means any losses cannot be offset against future earnings for tax calculations.

Conversely, in most other countries financial spread betting income is considered taxable. For example, the Australian Taxation Office issued a decision in March 2010 saying &quot;Yes, the gains from financial spread betting are assessable income under section 6-5 or section 15-15 of the ITAA 1997&quot;. Similarly, any losses on the spread betting contracts are deductible. This has resulted in a much lower interest in financial spread betting in those countries.

=== Financial spread bet example ===
Suppose Lloyds Bank is trading on the market at 410p bid, and 411p offer. A spread-betting company is also offering 410-411p. We use cash bets with no definite expiry, or &quot;rolling daily bets&quot; as they are referred to by the spread betting companies.

If I think the share price is going to go up, I might bet £10 a point (&quot;i.e.,&quot; £10 per penny the shares moves) at 411p. We use the offer price since I am &quot;buying&quot; the share (betting on its increase). Note that my total loss (if Lloyds Bank went to 0p) could be up to £4110, so this is as risky as buying 1000 of the shares normally.

If a bet goes overnight, the bettor is charged a financing cost (or receives it, if the bettor is shorting the stock). This might be set at LIBOR + a certain percentage, usually around 2-3%.

Thus, in the example, if Lloyds Bank are trading at 411p, then for every day I keep the bet open I am charged [taking finance cost to be 7%] ((411p x 10) * 7% / 365 ) = £0.78821 (or 78.8p)

On top of this, the bettor needs an amount as collateral in the spread-betting account to cover potential losses. Usually this is either 5 or 10% of the total exposure you are taking on but can go up to 100% on illiquid stocks. In this case £4110 * 0.1 or 0.05 = £411.00 or £205.50

If at the end of the bet Lloyds Bank traded at 400-401p, I need to cover that £4110 – £400*10 (£4000) = £110 difference by putting extra deposit (or collateral) into the account.

The punter usually receives all dividends and other corporate adjustments in the financing charge each night. For example, suppose Lloyds Bank goes ex-dividend with dividend of 23.5p. The bettor receives that amount. The exact amount received varies depending on the rules and policies of the spread betting company, and the taxes that are normally charged in the home tax country of the shares.

==Dangers of financial spread betting==
According to an article in &quot;The Times&quot; dated 10 April 2009, approximately 30,000 spread bet accounts were opened in the previous year, and that the largest study of gambling in the UK on behalf of the Gambling Commission found that serious problems developed in almost 15% of spread betters compared to 1% of other gambling. A report from Cass Business School found that only 1 in 5 gamblers ends up a winner. As noted in the report, this corresponds to the same ratio of successful gamblers in regular trading. Evidence from spread betting firms through an analysis of their risk warnings in October 2024 actually put this closer to being 2 in 10 traders as being profitable.

<text>Israel Putnam (January 7, 1718 – May 29, 1790), popularly known as &quot;Old Put&quot;, was an American military officer and landowner who fought with distinction at the Battle of Bunker Hill during the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783). He also served as an officer with Rogers&#x27; Rangers during the French and Indian War (1754–1763), when he was captured by Mohawk warriors. He was saved from the ritual burning given to enemies by the intervention of French officer Molang, with whom the Mohawks were allied. Putnam&#x27;s courage and fighting spirit became known far beyond his home of Connecticut&#x27;s borders through the circulation of folk legends in the American colonies and states celebrating his exploits.

==Early life==

Putnam was born in 1718 in Salem Village (now Danvers), Massachusetts to Joseph and Elizabeth (Porter) Putnam, a prosperous farming Puritan family. His parents had opposed the Salem witch trials in the 1690s.

Putnam moved west in 1740 at age 22 to Mortlake, Connecticut (today Brooklyn) where land was cheaper. While living in Connecticut, Putnam purchased several enslaved Africans to work on his lands. He killed a wolf in 1743 with the help of a group of farmers from Mortlake seeking to safeguard their sheep. They tracked the wolf to its den and tried sending in their dogs, but all the dogs returned frightened or injured by the wolf. They tried smoking out the wolf and burning sulfur at the mouth of the cave, all to no avail. After Putnam arrived, he tried getting his dog to enter the den, with no luck. He also tried to get his servant to enter with a torch and gun to shoot the wolf. His servant refused, as did all the other farmers. Putnam then reportedly crawled into the den with a torch, a musket loaded with buckshot, and his feet secured with rope to be quickly pulled out. While in the den, he killed the wolf.

In celebration of the event, Putnam was carried in a torch-lit procession through Pomfret in a celebration that lasted until about midnight. He earned the nicknames &quot;Wolf Putnam&quot; and &quot;Old Wolf Put&quot;, which stayed with him for decades afterward. A section of Mashamoquet Brook State Park in Pomfret, including the den, is named &quot;Israel Putnam Wolf Den&quot;. The name &quot;Wolf Den Road&quot; in adjacent Brooklyn also attests to the days of wolves.

Putnam married twice, first to Hannah Pope in 1739, the mother of his children. Two years after her death in 1765, he married Deborah Lothrop.

==Early military service==
Putnam was one of the first men in Connecticut in 1755 to sign up to serve as a private in the militia in the French and Indian War at age 37. Over the course of the war, he was promoted to second lieutenant, captain, major, lieutenant colonel, and colonel. He served with Robert Rogers, who gained fame as the commander of Rogers&#x27; Rangers, and the two of them had various exploits together, in one of which Putnam saved Rogers&#x27; life. Putnam&#x27;s reputation for courage was made famous by his participation in the war. It was said that &quot;Rogers always sent, but Putnam led his men to action.&quot;

In 1757, the Rangers were stationed on an island off Fort Edward. The following February, Putnam and his Rangers were still on Roger&#x27;s Island when fire broke out in the row of barracks nearest the magazine. The danger of an explosion was imminent, but Putnam took a position on the roof and poured bucket after bucket of water upon the flames, only descending when the buildings fell only a few feet from the magazine. In spite of his severe wounds, he continued to fight the fire, dashing water upon the magazine until the fire was under control. He was laid up for a month due to burns and exposure.
Putnam was captured on August 8, 1758, by Kahnawake Indians from a mission settlement south of Montreal during a military campaign near Crown Point in New York. He was saved from being ritually burned alive by a rainstorm and the last-minute intervention of a French officer.

In 1759, Putnam led a regiment into The Valley of Death in the attack on Fort Carillon and he was with the British army that marched on Montreal in 1760. In 1762, he survived a shipwreck during the British expedition against Cuba that led to the capture of Havana. Putnam is believed to have brought back Cuban tobacco seeds to New England, which he planted in the Hartford area. This reportedly resulted in the development of the renowned Connecticut Wrapper. In 1763, during Pontiac&#x27;s Rebellion, Putnam was sent with reinforcements to relieve Chief Pontiac&#x27;s siege of Fort Detroit.

After the war, he returned to his homestead, a remnant of which exists today as Putnam Farm in Brooklyn, Connecticut. Putnam publicly professed his Christian faith following the Seven Years&#x27; War in 1765 and joined the Congregational Church in his town. He was among those who objected to British tax action policies. Around the time of the Stamp Act crisis in 1766, he was elected to the Connecticut General Assembly and was one of the founders of the state&#x27;s chapter of the Sons of Liberty. In the fall of 1765, he threatened Governor Thomas Fitch over this issue. He said that Fitch&#x27;s house &quot;will be leveled with the dust in five minutes&quot; if Fitch did not turn over the stamp tax paper to the Sons of Liberty.

==American Revolutionary War==
===Battle of Bunker Hill===
By the eve of the American Revolution, Putnam had become a relatively prosperous farmer and tavern keeper, with more than a local reputation for his previous exploits. On April 20, 1775, while plowing one of his fields with his son, he received news of the Battle of Lexington and Concord that started the war the day before. He literally &quot;came off the plow&quot;, leaving it in the field and riding in eight hours, reaching Cambridge the next day and offering his services to the Patriot cause. Putnam was named a major general, making him second in rank to General Artemas Ward in the Army of Observation, which preceded the founding of the Continental Army.

Putnam was one of the primary figures at the Battle of Bunker Hill in June 1775, both in its planning and on the battlefield. During the battle, Putnam may have ordered William Prescott to tell his troops, &quot;Don&#x27;t fire until you see the whites of their eyes.&quot; It is debated exactly who said these words first; they are attributed to a number of officers. This command has since become one of the American Revolution&#x27;s notable quotations. It was given to make the best use of the low ammunition stocks that the troops had.

In the planning for the Battle of Bunker Hill, Putnam was likely the one who argued in favor of also fortifying the adjacent hill, which later became known as &quot;Breed&#x27;s Hill&quot;. This hill was closer to Boston, and from the hill cannons could fire on the British forces in Boston, forcing them to come out and attack the hill. The British suffered heavy casualties as they marched toward the American fortifications. However, the Americans ran out of powder and were eventually forced to retreat. American casualties were 449, while British casualties were 1,054. By the standard of the day the Americans lost, since they gave up the ground. However, Continental Army Brigadier General Nathanael Greene wrote to his brother that &quot;I wish we could sell them another hill, at the same price.&quot;

Years after the battle, and after Putnam&#x27;s death, he was accused by Henry Dearborn of failing to supply reinforcements and even of cowardice during the battle. The accusations created a long-standing controversy among veterans, family, friends, and historians. People were shocked by the rancor of the attack, and this prompted a forceful response from defenders of Putnam, including such notables as John and Abigail Adams. Historian Harold Murdock wrote that Dearborn&#x27;s account &quot;abounds in absurd misstatements and amazing flights of imagination.&quot; The Dearborn attack received considerable attention because at the time he was in the middle of controversy himself. He had been relieved of one of the top commands in the War of 1812 due to his mistakes. He had also been nominated to serve as U.S. Secretary of War by President James Monroe, but was rejected by the United States Senate (which was the first time that the Senate had voted against confirming a presidential cabinet choice).

===Long Island and later service===

On June 14, 1775, the Continental Congress voted to create the Continental Army. George Washington was chosen as Commander-in-Chief, with Putnam and three others appointed as major generals under Washington. Of the votes, only Washington and Putnam were unanimous.

After Bunker Hill, Washington arrived and Putnam served under him in the Siege of Boston. Due largely to the ingenious efforts of Henry Knox and Putnam&#x27;s cousin Rufus Putnam, the British were forced to abandon Boston.

Putnam subsequently served as temporary commander of the American forces in New York while waiting for Washington&#x27;s arrival there on April 13, 1776. Putnam&#x27;s fortunes declined at the Battle of Long Island in August 1776, where he was forced to effect a hasty retreat from the British. Some in the Second Continental Congress blamed Putnam for the defeat, but Washington, who was in overall command and witnessed the battle, did not.

It is possible that Putnam&#x27;s efforts saved Washington&#x27;s life or prevented his capture. As Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan described it, &quot;...it could be argued that we owe our national existence to the fortifications which General Israel Putnam threw up in April 1776 on the Buttermilk Channel side [of Governors Island, New York]... [British troops] landed on Long Island and headed for George Washington and his army. He had to flee, and he made it because Putnam&#x27;s artillery firing on Brooklyn Heights, over the Buttermilk Channel, held Howe back just long enough for Washington to escape to Manhattan and for the Revolutionary War to proceed.&quot;

With future Vice President Aaron Burr in his charge, Putnam was fooled in October 1777 by a feint executed by British troops under the command of General Sir Henry Clinton, making way for Clinton&#x27;s capture of Fort Montgomery and Fort Clinton. As was standard procedure, Putnam was relieved of command and brought before a court of inquiry for these losses. It was ascertained that the events in question were the result of a lack of men, not of the fault of any commander, and he was exonerated of any wrongdoing.

Putnam had personal friendships and deep respect for many of his British former comrades in arms in the French and Indian War, who were now his enemies. While in command in New York, there were several occasions on which he showed personal courtesies, such as providing newspapers to read or medical attention, to British officers who had become his prisoners of war. This offended many New Yorkers. He also showed an &quot;unconquerable aversion&quot; to many of those who were entrusted with the disposal of Tory property who Putnam felt were instead embezzling the funds. This also led to Putnam becoming unpopular with many influential New Yorkers, who complained to Washington.

Washington had also lost some of his faith in Putnam, due to an incident in which Putnam delayed in forwarding troops to Washington when first ordered to do so. One possible explanation was that his wife, mistaken for dead, had apparently been buried alive, expiring in the casket after burial. The grave was later exhumed, and it is possible that Putnam learned of the tragic error at the time he received Washington&#x27;s order. Regardless, Washington felt he could not have Putnam in charge of troops in New York without the support of that state, and transferred Putnam to recruiting duties in Connecticut after the court of inquiry finished its investigation of the loss of Forts Montgomery and Clinton. Putnam was later put in command of the Eastern Division, consisting of three brigades of New Hampshire and Connecticut troops. In 1779, he was put in command of the right wing of the army, which included the Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania divisions.

During the winter of 1778–1779, Putnam and his troops were encamped at the site now preserved as the Putnam Memorial State Park in Redding, Connecticut. On February 26, 1779, Putnam escaped from the British, riding down a steep slope in Greenwich, Connecticut, for which he became famous. A statue commemorating this escape was erected at Putnam Memorial State Park. In December 1779, Putnam suffered a paralyzing stroke, which ended his military service.

==Personality and characteristics==
Israel Putnam did not fit the stereotype of the taciturn New Englander. He was a gregarious tavern-keeper, a very industrious farmer, and an aggressive soldier, always looking for an excuse to discipline his soldiers. His farm was one of the most productive in the area (he bought out his partner and paid off his mortgage after only two years). In battle, he would lead from the front, not from behind. After hours, he would lead his comrades in singing the popular drinking songs of the day.

Putnam served as Washington&#x27;s second in command, and the two shared some key characteristics that other general officers of the time did not. Neither one of them had as much education as elite people of the era had. Putnam&#x27;s lack of education and unsophisticated manner prompted a captured Hessian officer to comment that &quot;This old gray-beard may be a good honest man, but nobody but the rebels would have made him a general.&quot; Some of America&#x27;s proper Philadelphians agreed. However, the common soldier admired Putnam&#x27;s courage and could see from his many visible battle scars that he knew what it was like to be on the front lines. They knew that he had achieved his position through first-hand experience, rather than just education or family connections. Historian Nathaniel Philbrick says flatly that &quot;Israel Putnam was the provincial army&#x27;s most beloved officer.&quot;

Putnam, whose spelling was a language all its own, nevertheless had a way with words. Both Washington and Putnam had to use their words to put down mutinies (on separate occasions) by their long-suffering, disgruntled troops. Biographer David Humphreys, who witnessed the Putnam event, wrote about it as follows:

&quot;The troops who had been badly fed, badly cloathed and worse paid ... formed the design of marching to Hartford, where the General Assembly was then in session, and of demanding redress at the point of the bayonet. Word having been brought to General Putnam that the second Brigade was under arms for this purpose, he mounted his horse, galloped to the Cantonment and thus addressed them:

&quot;&#x27;My brave lads, whither are you going? Do you intend to desert your Officers and to invite the enemy to follow you into the country? Whose cause have you been fighting and suffering so long in, is it not your own? Have you no property, no parents, wives or children? You have behaved like men so far – all the world is full of your praises – and posterity will stand astonished at your deeds: but not if you spoil all at last. Don&#x27;t you consider how much the country is distressed by the war, and that your officers have not been any better paid than yourselves? But we all expect better times and that the Country will do us ample justice. Let us all stand by one another then and fight it out like brave Soldiers. Think what a shame it would be for Connecticut men to run away from their officers.&#x27;&quot;

Putnam&#x27;s speech worked. After he finished, &quot;he directed the acting Major of Brigade to give the word for them to shoulder, march to their Regimental parades, and lodge arms. All of which they executed with promptitude and apparent good humor.&quot;

After hearing of the mutiny, Washington wrote to Putnam commending him for his success in quelling it. Putnam wrote to Washington that the incident had &quot;not been repeated, or attended with any farther ill consequences.&quot;.

Both Washington and Putnam were aggressive by nature and did not hesitate to put themselves in harm&#x27;s way if that was what was called for in battle. Both were fearless or at least able to function calmly while bullets whizzed around them. Yet, each was nevertheless able to calculate risk and make decisions accordingly. After leading inexperienced men in a successful engagement while being bombarded with cannonballs, Putnam commented, &quot;I wish we could have something of the kind to do every day; it would teach our men how little danger there is from cannon balls, for though they have sent a great many at us, nobody has been hurt by them.&quot;

Putnam has been criticized by historians as having not been a great strategic thinker, and during one of the planning sessions during the siege of Boston with Washington and his senior officers, Putnam grew tired of the endless discussion, and went to the window and started observing the British. Washington invited him back to the planning table, and Putnam responded, &quot;Oh, my dear General, you may plan the battle to suit yourself, and I will fight it.&quot;

However, Putnam was not without the ability to foresee both effective battlefield strategy and the big picture. He ordered his men to aim for the British officers, knowing the crippling effect it would have. He knew the value of inoculating the American troops against small pox, and the tendency of nervous soldiers to fire too soon and aim too high (possibly thus the orders to not fire until &quot;you see the whites of their eyes&quot; and to &quot;Take aim at the waistbands.&quot;). 
Putnam had a feel for the common soldier and how to make good use of him. He knew that a soldier was not worried about his head, but if his body was protected with earthworks, he would &quot;fight forever.&quot; Putnam also understood that a retreat could be a very effective tactic. &quot;Let me pick my officers, and I would not fear to meet [the enemy] with half the number... I would fight them on the retreat, and every stone wall we passed should be lined with their dead ... our men are lighter of foot, they understand their grounds and how to take advantage of them…&quot;

For one who was not supposed to be much of a strategic thinker, in some cases he was more prescient than his fellow generals. In discussion with Joseph Warren and General Artemas Ward before the Battle of Bunker Hill, Putnam advocated aggressive action against the British. Ward replied that &quot;As peace and reconciliation is what we seek for, would it not be better to act only on the defensive and give no unnecessary provocation?&quot; Putnam turned to Warren and said with emphasis, &quot;You know, Dr. Warren, we shall have no peace worth anything, till we gain it by the sword.&quot;

Shortly after Washington took command at Cambridge in 1775, he and the other generals hoped for a speedy resolution of the war. On one occasion with them gathered around his dinner table, Washington offered a toast: &quot;A speedy and honorable peace.&quot; A few days later, Putnam offered a different one: &quot;A long and moderate war.&quot; The sober and seldom-smiling Washington laughed out loud. Washington addressed Putnam, &quot;You are the last man, General Putnam, from whom I should have expected such a toast, you who are always urging vigorous measures, to plead now for a long, and what is still more extraordinary, a moderate, war, seems strange indeed.&quot; Putnam replied that a false peace would divide Americans and not be long-lasting. Putnam went on, &quot;I expect nothing but a long war, and I would have it a moderate one, that we may hold out till the mother country becomes willing to cast us off forever.&quot;

The Revolutionary War would drag on for eight-and-a-half years, the longest in United States history until the Vietnam War. Washington did not soon forget Putnam&#x27;s prescient toast. For years after, he more than once reminded Putnam of it.

==Burial==

Putnam died in Brooklyn, Connecticut, in 1790. He was buried in an above-ground tomb in the town&#x27;s South Cemetery. He is honored with an equestrian monument near his original burial site on Canterbury Road (Route 169).

Over the years, souvenir hunters removed fragments of the headstone of his tomb and eventually the marble marker became badly mutilated, and the overall condition of the tomb was deemed unsuitable for General Putnam&#x27;s remains; it was removed for safekeeping to the Connecticut State Capitol in Hartford. Sculptor Karl Gerhardt, who designed the nearby Soldiers&#x27; and Sailors&#x27; Monument as well as Civil War monuments in New York and New Jersey, was chosen to create a monument to house Putnam&#x27;s remains. In 1888, Putnam&#x27;s remains were removed from the Brooklyn cemetery and reinterred in a sarcophagus in the base, and the original headstone inscription was recreated on the monument.

==Legacy, namesakes, and honors==
Putnam&#x27;s birthplace in Danvers, Massachusetts, now known as the Putnam House, has been designated and preserved as a historic structure. His Connecticut farmhouse on Putnam Farm still stands today and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. A statue of Israel Putnam stands in Hartford&#x27;s Bushnell Park, near the Connecticut State Capitol. It was sculpted by John Quincy Adams Ward in 1873 and presented to the city in 1874.

Numerous places bear his name, including eight counties, starting with Putnam County, New York, which embraces the east bank of the Hudson Highlands where he once held command. Towns in New York and Connecticut are also named for him. His many namesakes include:

Tarbox, a historian, theologian, and author, and as the name of the first motel visited by the characters in the 1992 motion picture &quot;My Cousin Vinny&quot;. He also appeared in &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed III&quot; in a minor role.

His descendants include Benjamin Alexander Putnam, Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives and John Day Putnam, member of the Wisconsin State Assembly.

<doc id="52906" wikidata="Q734263" url="?curid=52906" title="Brunch">
<text>Brunch is a meal, sometimes accompanied taken sometime in the late morning or early afternoon – the universally accepted time is 11am-2pm, though modern brunch often extends as late as 3pm. The meal originated in the British hunt breakfast. The word &quot;brunch&quot; is a portmanteau of &quot;breakfast&quot; and &quot;lunch&quot;. The word originated in England in the late 19th century, and became popular in the United States in the 1930s.

==Origin of the word==
The 1896 supplement to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; cites &quot;Punch&quot; magazine, which wrote that the term was coined in Britain in 1895 to describe a Sunday meal for &quot;Saturday-night carousers&quot; in the writer Guy Beringer&#x27;s article &quot;Brunch: A Plea&quot; in &quot;Hunter&#x27;s Weekly&quot;.

Despite the substantially later date it has also been claimed that the term was possibly coined by reporter Frank Ward O&#x27;Malley, who wrote in the early 20th century for the New York City newspaper, &quot;The Sun&quot; from 1906 until 1919. It is thought that he may have come up with the term after observing the typical mid-day eating habits of his colleagues at the newspaper.

==At colleges and hotels==
Some colleges and hotels serve brunch, often serve-yourself buffets, although menu-ordered meals may be available as well. The meal usually consists of standard breakfast foods such as eggs, sausages, bacon, ham, fruits, pastries, pancakes, waffles, cereals, and scones.

==Military==
The United States, Canada and United Kingdom militaries often serve weekend brunch in their messes. They offer breakfast and lunch options, and usually are open from 09:00–12:00.

==Dim Sum brunch==
The dim sum brunch is popular in Chinese restaurants worldwide. It consists of a variety of stuffed buns, dumplings, and other savory or sweet foods that have been steamed, deep-fried, or baked. Customers select small portions from passing carts, as the kitchen continuously produces and sends out freshly prepared dishes. Dim sum is usually eaten at a mid-morning, midday, or mid-afternoon teatime.

== Special occasions ==
Brunch is prepared by restaurants and hotels for special occasions and holidays, such as weddings, Valentine&#x27;s Day, St. Patrick&#x27;s Day, Mother&#x27;s Day, Father&#x27;s Day, Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year, and Easter. 

==In other languages==

===Chinese===
The Chinese word &quot;早午饭&quot; () is defined as brunch, with &quot;早饭&quot; (; 早: morning, 饭: meal) meaning breakfast; and &quot;午饭&quot; (; 午: noon, 饭: meal) meaning lunch. The combination of &quot;早饭&quot; and &quot;午饭&quot; is thus &quot;早午饭&quot;, brunch.

===French===
The Office québécois de la langue française accepts &#x27;brunch&#x27; as a valid word but also provides a synonym &quot;déjeuner-buffet&quot;. Note that, however, in Quebec, &quot;déjeuner&quot; alone (even without the qualifying adjective &quot;petit&quot;) means &#x27;breakfast&#x27;. In Quebec, the word—when francized—is pronounced . The common pronunciation in France is .

===Italian===
In Italian, the English loanword &#x27;brunch&#x27; is generally used, though the neologism/calque is increasingly popular, being derived from (breakfast) and (lunch). Even less common but occasionally used are and , both derived from the same sources.

The usage of these terms varies in Italy, as different regions have different cultural definitions of mealtimes and their names. Traditional usage, particularly in northern Italy, included calling the first meal of the day (first ), and the second meal either or (second ), as distinguished from , the evening meal (now generally used as the term for the midday meal). In this scheme, a separate term for &#x27;brunch&#x27; would not be necessary, as could be used as a general term for any meal taken in the morning or early afternoon. Although Italian meal terminologies have generally shifted since widespread use of this naming scheme, the concept of a distinct mid-morning meal combining features of breakfast and lunch is largely one imported from the UK and North America in the last century, so the Anglicism &#x27;brunch&#x27; is predominant.

== Other places ==

=== Canada ===
The area now known as Leslieville neighbourhood is sometimes called the brunch capital of Toronto, as many renowned establishments serve brunch there. Brunch buffets also exist in other parts of Southern Ontario, including Kitchener-Waterloo.

In Canada, brunch is served in private homes and in restaurants. In both cases, brunch typically consists of the same dishes as would be standard in an American brunch, namely, coffee, tea, fruit juices, breakfast foods, including pancakes, waffles, and french toast; meats such as ham, bacon, and sausages; egg dishes such as scrambled eggs, omelettes, and eggs Benedict; bread products, such as toast, bagels or croissants; pastries or cakes, such as cinnamon rolls and coffee cake; and fresh cut fruit or fruit salad. Brunches may also include foods not typically associated with breakfast, such as roasted meats, quiche, soup, smoked salmon, sandwiches, and salads, such as Cobb salad.

When served at home or in a restaurant, a brunch may be offered buffet style, in which trays of foods and beverages are available and guests may serve themselves and select the items they want, often in an &quot;all-you-can-eat&quot; fashion. Restaurant brunches may also be served from a menu, in which case guests select specific items that are served by waitstaff. Restaurant brunch meals range from relatively inexpensive brunches available at diners and family restaurants to expensive brunches served at high-end restaurants and bistros.

===Philippines===

Brunch in the Philippines is served between 9:00 am and noon. Contrary to what is observed in other countries, brunch in the afternoon, between 3:00 and 4:00 pm, is called merienda, a traditional snack carried over from Spanish colonialism.

<text>The Zuiderzee or Zuider Zee (; old spelling &quot;Zuyderzee&quot; or &quot;Zuyder Zee&quot;), historically called Lake Almere and Lake Flevo, was a shallow bay of the North Sea in the northwest of the Netherlands. It extended about 100 km (60 miles) inland and at most 50 km (30 miles) wide, with an overall depth of about 4 to 5 metres (13–16 feet) and a coastline of about 300 km (200 miles). It covered . Its name is Dutch for &quot;southern sea&quot;, indicating that the name originates in Friesland, to the north of the Zuiderzee (cf. North Sea).

In the 20th century the majority of the Zuiderzee was closed off from the North Sea by the construction of the Afsluitdijk, leaving the mouth of the inlet to become part of the Wadden Sea. The salt water inlet changed into a fresh water lake now called the IJsselmeer (IJssel Lake) after the river that drains into it, and by means of drainage and polders, an area of some was reclaimed as land. This land eventually became the province of Flevoland. Part of the IJsselmeer was also divided into the Markermeer.

==History==

=== Lake Flevo ===

In classical times there was already a body of water in this location, called Lake Flevo (Flevo Lacus) by Roman authors. This was the central and largest lake in a region filled with a mixture of lowland and freshwater lakes occupying the area later filled by the Zuiderzee. It was separated from the sea by a belt of marsh and fen; at the time, the original coastline ran along the line of the Frisian Islands. A number of streams, including the Vecht, Eem, and Ysel, fed into the lake. The lake itself fed out into the North Sea through the Vlie (Latin &quot;Flevus&quot;). It existed in Roman times and the early Middle Ages.

From the Indo-European root &quot;&quot; &quot;flow&quot;, the name was transmitted by the Roman geographer Pomponius Mela in describing this region. In his treatise on geography of 44 AD, Pomponius speaks of a &quot;Flevo Lacus&quot;. He writes: &quot;The northern branch of the Rhine widens as Lake Flevo, and encloses an island of the same name, and then as a normal river flows to the sea&quot;. Other sources rather speak of Flevum, which could be related to today&#x27;s Vlie (Vliestroom), i.e. the seaway between the Dutch islands of Vlieland and Terschelling. This last name is grammatically more probable for a geographical indication, which is why it is assumed that Pomponius confused the declension of the word giving the name Flevo. In fact the Vlie formed outfall from the lake into the North Sea.

In the second half of the twentieth century the Flevopolders and a new province, Flevoland, took the name of the body of water which lay there long ago.

Over time these lakes gradually eroded their soft peat shores and spread (a process known as waterwolf). Some part of this area of water was later called the &quot;Vlie&quot;; it probably flowed into the sea through what is now the Vliestroom channel between the islands of Vlieland and Terschelling.

During a period of rising sea level between 250 and 600 CE, the connection to the sea and the lake were significantly enlarged. A period of lower sea levels followed.

=== Almere ===
The Marsdiep was once a river (&quot;fluvium Maresdeop&quot;) which may have been a distributary of the Vlie. During the early Middle Ages this began to change as rising sea levels and storms started to eat away at the coastal areas which consisted mainly of peatlands. In this period the inlet was referred to as the Almere, indicating it was still more of a lake, but the mouth and size of the inlet were much widened in the 12th century and especially after a disastrous flood in 1282 broke through the barrier dunes near Texel. The disaster marked the rise of Amsterdam on the southwestern end of the bay, since the seagoing traffic of the Baltic trade could now visit.

Lake Almere is mentioned among others in a life of saints written by Anglo-Saxon Bishop Saint Boniface in 753, and a deed of gift from the town of Urk. Its etymology may be eels, in Dutch &quot;aal&quot; or &quot;ael&quot;, so: &quot;ael mere&quot; = &quot;eel lake&quot; Presumably, the water of Lake Almere at that time was fresh water or slightly brackish. The name of the new town of Almere in Flevoland was given in 1984 in memory of this body of water.

A number of occurrences during the Middle Ages led to the transformation of the lake to an inland sea that would be called the Zuiderzee, which are:

* rising sea levels due to global warming known as the Medieval Warm Period.
* excavation of peat by the Frisians in West Friesland near the Vlie, a river that connected lake Almere to the North Sea.
* floods such as the All Saints&#x27; Flood (1170) and St. Lucia&#x27;s flood 1287.
Especially during the 12th century, particularly in 1219 and 1282, high tides and storms eroded the western banks of the Vlie and submerged large areas of land. The land between Stavoren, Texel, and Medemblik was washed away around 1170. The waterway between Stavoren and Enkhuizen, however, did not appear until around 1400. The erosion was stopped to the south and east by the high sandy shores of Gooi, Veluwe, Voorst, and Gasterland in the provinces of Utrecht, Gelderland, Overysel, and Friesland respectively.

=== Zuiderzee ===
The even more massive St. Lucia&#x27;s flood occurred 14 December 1287, when the seawalls broke during a storm, killing approximately 50,000 to 80,000 people in the fifth largest flood in recorded history. The flood occurred during a memorable storm in Friesland and Holland, and came from the North Sea, breaking and destroying several dams and dunes and transforming it into a bay which was then called the Zuiderzee, meaning &quot;Southern Sea&quot;. The name &quot;Zuiderzee&quot; came into general usage around this period.

The size of this inland sea remained largely stable from the 15th century onwards due to improvements in dikes, but when storms pushed North Sea water into the inlet, the Zuiderzee became a volatile cauldron of water, frequently resulting in flooding and the loss of ships. For example, on 18 November 1421, a seawall at the Zuiderzee dike broke, which flooded 72 villages and killed about 10,000 people. This was the Second St. Elizabeth&#x27;s flood.

The process of creating polders had developed to a point by 1667 that the damming of the Zuiderzee was proposed, although a feasible method did not appear until the 20th century.

The Netherlands was part of the First French Empire between 1810 and 1813. A département was formed in 1811 and named as Zuyderzée after the Zuiderzee, whose territory roughly corresponded to the present provinces of North Holland and Utrecht.

In 1928, the 6-meter and 8-meter sailing events for the Amsterdam Summer Olympics were held on the Zuiderzee.

=== Zuiderzee Works ===

The construction between 1927 and 1932 of a 19-mile long dam (the Afsluitdijk), under plans originating from Cornelius Lely, enclosed the Zuiderzee. The creation of this dam was hastened by the Flood of January 1916. Plans for closing the Zuiderzee had been made over thirty years earlier but had not yet passed in parliament. With the completion of the Afsluitdijk in 1932, the Zuiderzee became the IJsselmeer, and the outer portion of the Zuiderzee became the Wadden Sea. Large areas of land, mainly for agricultural use, were subsequently reclaimed from the water through the construction of polders with dams, pumping, and other hydrological technology. Four had been built by the early 1980s. They were the Wieringermeer Polder built in 1930; the Northeast (Noordoost) Polder, built in 1942; the East (Oostelijk) Flevoland Polder, built in 1957; and the South (Zuidelijk) Flevoland Polder, completed in 1968. A fifth, Markewaard, began construction in 1963, and became partially complete, but was abandoned in the mid-1980s. Collectively, this system of dams, dikes, and polders is called the Zuiderzee Works.

==Geography==
Around the Zuiderzee many fishing villages grew up and several developed into walled towns with extensive trade connections, in particular Kampen, a town in Overijssel, and later also towns in Holland such as Amsterdam, Hoorn, and Enkhuizen. These towns traded at first with ports on the Baltic Sea, in England, and in the Hanseatic League, but later also with the rest of the world when the Netherlands established its colonial empire. When that lucrative trade diminished, most of the towns fell back on fishing and some industry until the 20th century when tourism became the major source of income.

Contained within the Zuiderzee were five small islands, the remains of what were once larger islands, peninsulas connected to the mainland, or in the case of Pampus, an artificial island. These were Wieringen, Urk, Schokland, Pampus and Marken. The inhabitants of these islands also subsisted mainly on fishing and related industries and still do in the case of Urk and Wieringen. All of these islands, except for Pampus, are now part of the mainland or connected to it.

<text>A town is a type of a human settlement, generally larger than a village but smaller than a city.

The criteria for distinguishing a town vary globally, often depending on factors such as population size, economic character, administrative status, or historical significance. In some regions, towns are formally defined by legal charters or government designations, while in others, the term is used informally. Towns typically feature centralized services, infrastructure, and governance, such as municipal authorities, and serve as hubs for commerce, education, and cultural activities within their regions.

The concept of a town varies culturally and legally. For example, in the United Kingdom, a town may historically derive its status from a market town designation or royal charter, while in the United States, the term is often loosely applied to incorporated municipalities. In some countries, such as Australia and Canada, distinctions between towns, cities, and rural areas are based on population thresholds. Globally, towns play diverse roles, ranging from agricultural service centers to suburban communities within metropolitan areas.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;town&quot; shares an origin with the German word , the Dutch word , and the Old Norse . The original Proto-Germanic word, *&quot;tūnan&quot;, is thought to be an early borrowing from Proto-Celtic *&quot;dūnom&quot; (cf. Old Irish , Welsh ).

The original sense of the word in both Germanic and Celtic was that of a fortress or an enclosure. Cognates of &quot;town&quot; in many modern Germanic languages designate a fence or a hedge. In English and Dutch, the meaning of the word took on the sense of the space which these fences enclosed, and through which a track must run. In England, a town was a small community that could not afford or was not allowed to build walls or other larger fortifications, and built a palisade or stockade instead. In the Netherlands, this space was a garden, more specifically those of the wealthy, which had a high fence or a wall around them (like the garden of the palace of Het Loo in Apeldoorn, which was the model for the privy garden of William III and Mary II at Hampton Court). In Old Norse means a (grassy) place between farmhouses, and the word is still used with a similar meaning in modern Norwegian.

Old English became a common place-name suffix in England and southeastern Scotland during the Anglo-Saxon settlement period. In Old English and Early and Middle Scots, the words &quot;ton&quot;, &quot;toun&quot;, etc. could refer to diverse kinds of settlements from agricultural estates and holdings, partly picking up the Norse sense (as in the Scots word ) at one end of the scale, to fortified municipalities. Other common Anglo-Saxon suffixes included &quot;ham&quot; &#x27;home&#x27;, &quot;stede&quot; &#x27;stead&#x27;, and &quot;burh&quot; &#x27;bury, borough, burgh&#x27;.

In toponymic terminology, names of individual towns and cities are called &quot;astyonyms&quot; or &quot;astionyms&quot; (from Ancient Greek &#x27;town, city&#x27;, and &#x27;name&#x27;).

== Meaning ==
In some cases, &quot;town&quot; is an alternative name for &quot;city&quot; or &quot;village&quot; (especially a small city or large village; and occasionally even hamlets). Sometimes, the word &quot;town&quot; is short for &quot;township&quot;. In general, today towns can be differentiated from townships, villages, or hamlets on the basis of their economic character, in that most of a town&#x27;s population will tend to derive their living from manufacturing industry, commerce, and public services rather than primary sector industries such as agriculture or related activities.

A place&#x27;s population size is not a reliable determinant of urban character. In many areas of the world, e.g. in India at least until recent times, a large village might contain several times as many people as a small town. In the United Kingdom, there are historical cities that are far smaller than the larger towns.
The modern phenomenon of extensive suburban growth, satellite urban development, and migration of city dwellers to villages has further complicated the definition of towns, creating communities urban in their economic and cultural characteristics but lacking other characteristics of urban localities.

Some forms of non-rural settlement, such as temporary mining locations, may be clearly non-rural, but have at best a questionable claim to be called a town.

Towns often exist as distinct governmental units, with legally defined borders and some or all of the appurtenances of local government (e.g. a police force). In the United States these are referred to as &quot;incorporated towns&quot;. In other cases the town lacks its own governance and is said to be &quot;unincorporated&quot;. The existence of an unincorporated town may be legally set out by other means, e.g. zoning districts. In the case of some planned communities, the town exists legally in the form of covenants on the properties within the town. The United States census identifies many census-designated places (CDPs) by the names of unincorporated towns which lie within them; however, those CDPs typically include rural and suburban areas and even surrounding villages and other towns.
The distinction between a town and a city similarly depends on the approach: a city may strictly be an administrative entity which has been granted that designation by law, but in informal usage, the term is also used to denote an urban locality of a particular size or importance: whereas a medieval city may have possessed as few as 10,000 inhabitants, today some consider an urban place of fewer than 100,000 as a town, even though there are many officially designated cities that are much smaller than that.

193 countries have been involved in a common effort to agree on a common statistical definition of the three categories: cities, towns and rural areas.

=== Age of towns scheme ===
Australian geographer Thomas Griffith Taylor proposed a classification of towns based on their age and pattern of land use. He identified five types of towns:

* &quot;Infantile towns&quot;, with no clear zoning
* &quot;Juvenile towns&quot;, which have developed an area of shops
* &quot;Adolescent towns&quot;, where factories have started to appear
* &quot;Early mature towns&quot;, with a separate area of high-class housing
* &quot;Mature towns&quot;, with defined industrial, commercial and various types of residential area

==History==
Through different periods of recorded history, many towns have grown into sizeable settlements, with the development of properties, centres of culture, and specialized economies.

===Neolithic===
Çatalhöyük, currently an archaeological site, was considered to be the oldest inhabited town, or proto-city, that existed from around 7500 BC. Inscribed as a World Heritage Site, it remains a depopulated town with a complex of ruins.

===Roman era===

In Roman times, a villa was a rural settlement formed by a main residential building and another series of secondary buildings. It constituted the center from which an agricultural holding was administered. Subsequently, it lost its agricultural functions and reduced its activity to residential. With the consolidation of large estates during the Roman Empire, the town became the center of large farms.

A distinction was created between rustic and urban settlements:
*Rustic villas (Villa rustica), from where the exploitation of resources was directed, slave workers resided, livestock were kept and production was stored.
*Urban villas, in which the lord resided and which increasingly adopted the architectural and beautification forms typical of urban mansions. When from the first century the great territorial property was divided between the area directly exploited by the lord and that ceded to tenant settlers, urban villas became the centers of the administrative power of the lords, appearing the forms of vassalage typical of feudalism of the fourth century.

== By country ==

=== Afghanistan ===

In Afghanistan, a city and a town are both referred to as &quot;shār&quot; (; ). The capital of each of its 34 provinces may include a major city such as Kabul whose population is over five million people or a town such as Parun, the capital of Nuristan Province, whose population is less than 20,000 people.

=== Albania and Kosovo ===
In Albania and Kosovo means &#x27;town&#x27;, which is very similar to the word for city (), although there is no official use of the term for any settlement.
In Albanian, means &#x27;small city&#x27; or &#x27;new city&#x27;, while in ancient times it referred to a small residential center within the walls of a castle.

=== Australia ===
In Australia, most rural and regional centres of population can be called towns; many small towns have populations of less than 200. The smallest may be described as townships.

In addition, some local government entities are officially styled as towns in Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory, and formerly also (till the 1990s) in Victoria.

=== Austria ===
The Austrian legal system does not distinguish between villages, towns, and cities. The country is partitioned into 2098 municipalities () of fundamentally equal rank. Larger municipalities are designated as market towns () or cities (), but these distinctions are purely symbolic and do not confer additional legal responsibilities. There is a number of smaller communities that are labelled cities because they used to be regional population centers in the distant past. The city of Rattenberg for example has about 400 inhabitants. The city of Hardegg has about 1200 inhabitants.

There are no unincorporated areas.

Of the 201 cities in Austria, 15 are statutory cities (). A statutory city is a city that is vested, in addition to its purview as a municipality, with the duties of a district administrative authority. The status does not come with any additional autonomy: district administrative authorities are essentially just service centers that citizens use to interact with the national government, for example to apply for driver licenses or passports. The national government generally uses the provinces to run these points of contact on its behalf; in the case of statutory cities, the municipality gets to step up.

=== Brazil ===
In Brazil, since 1938, it was defined that the seat of the municipalities would pass to the category of city and give it the name and the districts would be designated by the name of their respective seats, and if they were not municipal seats, they would have the category of town.

=== Bulgaria ===
Bulgarians do not, in general, differentiate between &#x27;city&#x27; and &#x27;town&#x27;. However, in everyday language and media the terms &quot;large towns&quot; and &quot;small towns&quot; are in use. &quot;Large towns&quot; usually refers to Sofia, Plovdiv, Varna and Burgas, which have population over 200,000. Ruse and Stara Zagora are often included as well due to presence of relatively developed infrastructure and population over 100,000 threshold. It is difficult to call the remaining provincial capitals &quot;large towns&quot; as, in general, they are less developed and have shrinking population, some with as few as 30,000 inhabitants.

In Bulgaria the Council of Ministers defines what constitutes a settlement, while the President of Bulgaria grants each settlement its title. In 2005 the requirement that villages that wish to classify themselves as town must have a social and technical infrastructure, as well as a population of no fewer than 3500 people. For resort settlements the requirements are lower with the population needing to be no fewer than 1000 people but infrastructure requirements remain.

=== Canada ===

The legal definition of a town in Canada varies by province or territory, as each has jurisdiction over defining and legislating towns, cities and other types of municipal organization within its own boundaries.

The province of Quebec is unique in that it makes no distinction under law between towns and cities. There is no intermediate level in French between and (&quot;municipality&quot; is an administrative term usually applied to a legal, not geographical entity), so both are combined under the single legal status of &quot;ville&quot;. While an informal preference may exist among English speakers as to whether any individual is commonly referred to as a city or as a town, no distinction and no objective legal criteria exist to make such a distinction under law.

Ontario allows municipalities to select whichever administrative term they like with no legal distinction existing between towns, townships, cities, and villages. Instead all municipalities, with the exception of Toronto and Ottawa, fall into one of three legal categories under the Municipalities Act: Single-tier (I.e. towns that are located within a region or county but that are considered separate for municipal purposes such as Hamilton), lower-tier (i.e. municipalities that are part of a region or county such as St. Catharines), or upper-tier (i.e. regional municipalities such as Niagara). Accordingly, many larger municipalities continue to use the title of town due to it better reflecting the character of the municipality. For example, Oakville (2021 Population: 213,759) is the largest municipality to use the title of town to reflect its largely suburban character while other municipalities such as Richmond Hill (2021 Population: 202,022) have opted to change their status from &quot;town&quot; to &quot;city&quot; to encourage investment.

=== Chile ===
In Chile, towns (Spanish: ) are defined by the National Statistics Institute (INE) as an urban entity with a population from 2001 to 5000 or an area with a population from 1001 to 2000 and an established economic activity.

===Czechia===
In Czechia, a municipality can obtain the title of a city (), town () or market town (). The title is granted by law.

Statutory cities (in English usually called just &quot;cities&quot;), which are defined by law no. 128/2000 Coll., can define their own self-governing municipal districts. There are 26 such cities, in addition to Prague, which is a &quot;de facto&quot; statutory city. All the Czech municipalities with more than 40,000 inhabitants are cities.

Town and market town are above all ceremonious honorary degrees, referring to population, history and regional significance of a municipality. As the statistics of Czech municipalities shows, towns usually have between 1,000 and 35,000 inhabitants, with median around 4,000 and average around 6,500. Nowadays a municipality must have at least 3,000 inhabitants to have the right to request the town title. Market towns usually have between 500 and 4,000 inhabitants, with median and average both around 1,000.

=== Denmark ===
In Denmark, in many contexts no distinction is made between &quot;city&quot;, &quot;town&quot; and &quot;village&quot;; all three translate as . In more specific use, for small villages and hamlets the word (meaning &#x27;country town&#x27;) is used, while the Danish equivalent of English &quot;city&quot; is (meaning &#x27;large town&#x27;). For formal purposes, urban areas having at least 200 inhabitants are considered .

Historically some towns held various privileges, the most important of which was the right to hold market. They were administered separately from the rural areas in both fiscal, military and legal matters. Such towns are known as (roughly the same meaning as &quot;borough&quot; albeit deriving from a different etymology) and they retain the exclusive right to the title even after the last vestiges of their privileges vanished through the reform of the local administration carried through in 1970.

===Estonia===
In Estonia, there is no distinction between a town and a city as the word is used for both bigger and smaller settlements, which are bigger than villages and boroughs. There are 30 municipal towns () in Estonia and a further 17 towns, which have merged with a municipal parish ().

===Finland===

In Finland, there is no distinction between a town and a city as the word is used for both bigger and smaller settlements, which are bigger than villages and boroughs; although when talking about the word &quot;town&quot;, the word is used ( means &#x27;little&#x27; or &#x27;small&#x27;). There are over one hundred municipal towns in Finland.

=== France ===

From an administrative standpoint, the smallest level of local authorities are all called &quot;communes&quot;. They can have anywhere from a handful to millions of inhabitants, and France has 36,000 of them. The French term for &quot;town&quot; is &quot;&quot; but French laws generally do not distinguish between towns and cities which are all commonly called . However, some laws do treat these authorities differently based on the population and different rules apply to the three big cities Paris, Lyon and Marseille. For historical reasons, six communes in the Meuse département exist as independent administrative entities despite having no inhabitants at all.

For statistical purposes, the national statistical institute (INSEE) operates a distinction between urban areas with fewer than 2,000 inhabitants and bigger communes, the latter being called . Smaller settlements are usually called .

=== Germany ===

Germans do not, in general, differentiate between &#x27;city&#x27; and &#x27;town&#x27;. The German word for both is , as it is the case in many other languages that do not differentiate between these concepts. The word for a &#x27;village&#x27;, as a smaller settlement, is . However, the International Statistics Conference of 1887 defined different sizes of , based on their population size, as follows: (&#x27;country town&#x27;; under 5,000), (&#x27;small town&#x27;; 5,000 to 20,000), (&#x27;middle town&#x27;; between 20,000 and 100,000) and (&quot;large town&quot;; 100,000 to 1,000,000). The term may be translated as &#x27;city&#x27;. In addition, Germans may speak of a , a city with anywhere between one and five million inhabitants (such as Cologne, Munich, Hamburg and Berlin). Also, a city with more than five million inhabitants is often referred to as a (commonly translated as megacity).

Historically, many settlements became a by being awarded a &quot;Stadtrecht&quot; in medieval times. In modern German language use, the historical importance, the existence of central functions (education, retail etc.) and the population density of an urban place might also be taken as characteristics of a . The modern local government organisation is subject to the laws of each state and refers to a (municipality), regardless of its historic title. While most form part of a (district) on a higher tier of local government, larger towns and cities may have the status of a , combining both the powers of a municipality and a district.

Designations in different states are as diverse as e.g. in Australian States and Territories, and differ from state to state. In some German states, the words (&#x27;market&#x27;), (both used in southern Germany) or (&#x27;spot&#x27;; northern Germany e.g. in Lower Saxony) designate a town-like residential community between and with special importance to its outer conurbation area. Historically those had (market right) but not full town privileges; see Market town. The legal denomination of a specific settlement may differ from its common designation (e.g. – a legal term in Lower Saxony for a group of villages [, pl. ] with common local government created by combining municipalities [, pl. ]).

=== Greece and Cyprus ===
In ordinary speech, Greeks use the word (&#x27;village&#x27;) to refer to smaller settlements and the word or (&#x27;city&#x27;) to refer to larger ones. Careful speakers may also use the word to refer to towns with a population of 2,000–9,999.
In Greek administrative law there used to be a distinction between , i.e. municipalities with more than 10,000 inhabitants or considered important for some other geographical (county seats), historical or ecclesiastical (bishops&#x27; seats) reason, and κοινότητες, referring to smaller self-governing units, mostly villages. A sweeping reform, carried out in two stages early in the 21st century, merged most with the nearest , dividing the whole country into 325 self-governing . The former municipalities survive as administrative subdivisions (, ).

Cyprus, including the Turkish-occupied areas, is also divided into 39 (in principle, with at least 5,000 inhabitants, though there are exceptions) and 576 .

=== Hong Kong ===


Hong Kong started developing new towns in the 1950s, to accommodate exponential population increase. The first new towns included Tsuen Wan and Kwun Tong. In the late 1960s and the 1970s, another stage of new town developments was launched. Nine new towns have been developed so far. Land use is carefully planned and development provides plenty of room for public housing projects. Rail transport is usually available at a later stage. The first towns are Sha Tin, Tsuen Wan, Tuen Mun and Tseung Kwan O. Tuen Mun was intended to be self-reliant, but was not successful and turned into a bedroom community like the other new towns. More recent developments are Tin Shui Wai and North Lantau (Tung Chung-Tai Ho).

=== Hungary ===
In Hungary there is no official distinction between a city and a town (the word for both in Hungarian is ). Nevertheless, the expressions formed by adding the adjectives (&#x27;small&#x27;) and (&#x27;large&#x27;) to the beginning of the root word (e.g. ) have been normalized to differentiate between cities and towns (towns being smaller, therefore bearing the name .) In Hungary, a village can gain the status of (&#x27;town&#x27;), if it meets a set of diverse conditions for quality of life and development of certain public services and utilities (e.g. having a local secondary school or installing full-area sewage collection pipe network). Every year the Minister of Internal Affairs selects candidates from a committee-screened list of applicants, whom the President of Republic usually affirms by issuing a bill of town&#x27;s rank to them. Since being a town carries extra fiscal support from the government, many relatively small villages try to win the status of (&#x27;town rank&#x27;) nowadays.

Before the fall of communism in 1990, Hungarian villages with fewer than 10,000 residents were not allowed to become towns. Recently some settlements as small as 2,500 people have received the rank of town (e.g. Visegrád, Zalakaros or Gönc) and meeting the conditions of development is often disregarded to quickly elevate larger villages into towns. As of middle 2013, there are 346 towns in Hungary, encompassing some 69% of the entire population.

Towns of more than 50,000 people are able to gain the status of (town with the rights of a county), which allows them to maintain a higher degree of services. (There are a few exceptions, when towns of fewer than 50,000 people gained the status: Érd, Hódmezővásárhely, Salgótarján and Szekszárd) As of middle 2013, there are only 23 such towns in Hungary.

=== Iceland ===

=== India ===

The 2011 Census of India defines towns of two types: statutory town and census town. Statutory town is defined as all places with a municipality, corporation, cantonment board or notified town area committee. Census towns are defined as places that satisfy the following criteria:
# Minimum population of 5,000
# At least 75% of male working population engaged in non-agricultural pursuits
# Density of population at least 400/km2. (1,000 per sq. mile).

All the statutory towns, census towns and out growths are considered as urban settlements, as opposed to rural areas.

Towns in India usually have basic infrastructure like shops, electricity, bitumenised roads, post offices, banks, telephone facilities, high schools and sometimes a few government offices. The human population living in these towns may be a few thousand. There are some towns which can be labelled as Main road town.

In state of Karnataka, towns are known as or in the Kannada language. Sometimes the terms (&#x27;city&#x27;) or , which generally means &#x27;place&#x27;, are used for towns. The administrative council which governs these towns is known as or in Kannada depending on the number of people living within the town&#x27;s boundaries.

=== Iran ===
In contemporary Persian texts, no distinction is made between &quot;city&quot; and &quot;town&quot;; both translate as (). In older Persian texts (until the first half of the 20th century), the Arabic word () was used for a town. However, in the past 50 years, this word has become obsolete.

There is a word in Persian which is used for special sort of satellite townships and city neighborhoods. It is (), (lit.: &#x27;small city&#x27;).
Another smaller type of town or neighborhood in a big city is called (). and each have different legal definitions.
Large cities such as Tehran, Mashhad, Isfahan, Tabriz, etc. which have millions inhabitants are referred to as (), metropole.

The pace in which different large villages have gained city status in Iran shows a dramatic increase in the last two decades.

Bigger cities and towns usually are centers of a township (in Persian: (). itself is a subdivision of (), &#x27;province&#x27;.

=== Iraq ===
The word () is used to describe villages, the word () to describe towns, and the word () to describe cities.

=== Ireland ===
The Local Government act 2001 provides that from 1 January 2002 (section 10 subsection (3)):
These provisions affect the replacement of the boroughs, towns and urban districts which existed before then. Similar reforms in the nomenclature of local authorities (but not their functions) are affected by section 11 part 17 of the act includes provision (section 185(2))

and contains provisions enabling the establishment of new town councils and provisions enabling the dissolution of existing or new town councils in certain circumstances

The reference to &quot;town having a population of at least 7,500 as ascertained at the last preceding census&quot; hands much of the power relating to defining what is in fact a town over to the Central Statistics Office and their criteria are published as part of each census.

====Planning and Development Act 2000====
Another reference to the Census and its role in determining what is or is not a town for some administrative purpose is in the Planning and Development act 2000 (part II chapter I which provides for Local area plans):

====Central Statistics Office criteria====
These are set out in full at 2006 Census Appendices.

In short they speak of &quot;towns with legally defined boundaries&quot; (i.e. those established by the Local Government Act 2001) and the remaining 664 as &quot;census towns&quot;, defined by themselves since 1971 as &quot;a cluster of 50 or more occupied dwellings in which within a distance of 800 meters there is a nucleus of 30 occupied houses on both sides of the road or twenty occupied Houses on one side of the road&quot;. There is also a &quot;200 meter criterion&quot; for determining whether a house is part of a census town.

===Isle of Man===
There are four settlements which are historically and officially designated as towns (Douglas, Ramsey, Peel, Castletown); however
* Peel is also sometimes referred to as a city by virtue of its cathedral.
* Onchan and Port Erin are both larger in population than the smallest &quot;town&quot;, having expanded in modern times, but are designated as villages.

=== Israel ===
Modern Hebrew does provide a word for the concept of a town: (), derived from (), the biblical word for &#x27;city&#x27;. However, the term is normally used only to describe towns in foreign countries, i.e. urban areas of limited population, particularly when the speaker is attempting to evoke nostalgic or romantic attitudes. The term is also used to describe a shtetl, a pre-Holocaust Eastern European Jewish town.

Within Israel, established urban areas are always referred to as cities (with one notable exception explained below) regardless of their actual size. Israeli law does not define any nomenclature for distinction between urban areas based on size or any other factor – meaning that all urban settlements in Israel are legally referred to as &quot;cities&quot;.

The exception to the above is the term (, lit. &#x27;Development Town&#x27;) which is applied to certain cities in Israel based on the reasons for their establishment. These cities, created during the earlier decades of Israeli independence (1950s and 1960s, generally), were designed primarily to serve as commercial and transportation hubs, connecting smaller agricultural settlements in the northern and southern regions of the country (the &quot;Periphery&quot;) to the major urban areas of the coastal and central regions. Some of these development towns have since grown to a comparatively large size, and yet are still referred to as development towns, particularly when the speaker wishes to emphasize their (often low) socio-economic status. Nonetheless, they are rarely (if ever) referred to simply as towns; when referring to one directly, it will be called either a development town or a city, depending on context.

=== Italy ===

Although Italian provides different words for city (), town () and village (, old-fashioned, or , most common), no legal definitions exist as to how settlements must be classified. Administratively, both towns and cities are ruled as comuni/comunes, while villages might be subdivisions of the former.
Generally, in everyday speech, a town is larger or more populated than a village and smaller than a city. Various cities and towns together may form a metropolitan area (). A city can also be a culturally, economically, or politically prominent community with respect to surrounding towns. Moreover, a city can be such by Presidential decree. A town, in contrast, can be an inhabited place which would elsewhere be styled a city, but has not received any official recognition.
Remarkable exceptions do exist: for instance, Bassano del Grappa, was given the status of in 1760 by Francesco Loredan&#x27;s dogal decree and has since then carried this title. Also, the Italian word for &#x27;town&#x27; ( with lowercase P) must not be confused with the Italian word for &#x27;country/nation&#x27; ( usually with uppercase P).

=== Japan ===
In Japan, city status (市 &quot;shi&quot;) was traditionally reserved for only a few particularly large settlements. Over time however the necessary conditions to be a city have been watered down and today the only loose rules that apply are having a population over 50,000 and over 60% of the population in a &quot;city centre&quot;. In recent times many small villages and towns have merged in order to form a city despite seeming geographically to be just a collection of villages.

The distinction between towns (町 &quot;machi/chō&quot;) and villages (村 &quot;mura/son&quot;) is largely unwritten and purely one of population size when the settlement was founded with villages having under 10,000 and towns 10,000–50,000.

=== Korea ===

In both of South Korea and North Korea, towns are called &quot;eup&quot; (). Most cities in North Korea are built around a central square. Perhaps it is to symbolize the importance of the society over the individual, or just a handy place for mass gatherings and celebrations.

=== Latvia ===

In Latvia, towns and cities are indiscriminately called in singular form. The name is a contraction of two Latvian words: (&#x27;castle&#x27;) and (&#x27;fence&#x27;), making it very obvious what is meant by the word – what is situated between the castle and the castle fence. However, a city can be called (big city) or &quot;mazpilsēta&quot; (small city/town) in reference to its size. Latvia also has administrative units such as state cities() A village is called or in Latvian.

=== Lithuania ===

In Lithuanian, a city is called &#x27; and a town is called &#x27; (literally &#x27;small &#x27;). Metropolises are called (literally &#x27;big &#x27;).

=== Malaysia ===
In Malaysia, a town is the area administered by a municipal council ().

=== Netherlands ===

Before 1848 there was a legal distinction between and non- parts of the country, but the word no longer has any legal significance. About 220 places were granted (&#x27;city rights&#x27;) and are still so called for historical and traditional reasons, though the word is also used for large urban areas that never obtained such rights. Because of this, in the Netherlands, no distinction is made between &quot;city&quot; and &quot;town&quot;; both translate as . A hamlet () usually has fewer than 1,000 inhabitants, a village () ranges from 1,000 up to 25,000 inhabitants, and a place above 25,000 can call itself either village or city, mostly depending on historic reasons or size of the place. As an example, The Hague never gained city rights, but because of its size – more than half a million inhabitants – it is regarded as a city. Staverden, with only 40 inhabitants, would be a hamlet, but because of its city rights it may call itself a city.

For statistical purposes, the Netherlands has three sorts of cities:
* (small city): 50,000–99,999 inhabitants
* (medium-sized city): 100,000–249,999 inhabitants
* (large city): 250,000 or more

Only Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht are regarded as a .

=== Norway ===
In Norway, &quot;city&quot; and &quot;town&quot; both translate to &quot;by&quot;, even if a city may be referred to as (&#x27;large town&#x27;). They are all part of and administered as a &quot;kommune&quot; (&#x27;municipality&#x27;).

Norway has had inland the northernmost city in the world: Hammerfest. Now the record is held by New Ålesund on the Norwegian island Svalbard.
The oldest town in Norway is Tønsberg, founded during the Viking Age. The year when the town was founded and which person who founded it is unknown, but Snorri Sturluson says in the Saga of Harald Fairhair that the market town existed before the Battle of Hafrsfjord in the year 872. Nowadays Tønsberg is considered a city ().

=== Philippines ===
In the Philippines, the local official equivalent of the town is the municipality (Filipino: ). Every municipality, or town, in the country has a mayor () and a vice mayor () as well as local town officials (Sangguniang Bayan). Philippine towns, otherwise called municipalities, are composed of a number of villages and communities called &quot;barangays&quot; with one (or a few cluster of) (s) serving as the town center or &quot;poblacion&quot;.

Unique in Philippine towns is that they have fixed budget, population and land requirements to become as such, i.e. from a , or a cluster of such, to a town, or to become cities, i.e. from town to a city. Respectively, examples of these are the town of B. E. Dujali in Davao del Norte province, which was formed in 1998 from a cluster of five , and the city of El Salvador, which was converted from a town to a city in 2007. Each town in the Philippines was classified by its annual income and budget.

A sharp, hierarchical distinction exists between Philippine cities ( or ) and towns, as towns in the country are juridically separate from cities, which are typically larger and more populous (some smaller and less populated) and which political and economic status are above those of towns. This was further supported and indicated by the income classification system implemented by the National Department of Finance, to which both cities and towns fell into their respective categories that indicate they are such as stated under Philippine law. However, both towns and cities equally share the status as local government units (LGUs) grouped under and belong to provinces and regions; both each are composed of and are governed by a mayor and a vice mayor supplemented by their respective LGU legislative councils. However, despite this some towns in the Philippines are significantly larger than some cities in the Philippines such as Rodriguez, Rizal, Santa Maria, Bulacan and Minglanilla, Cebu are actually bigger than some regional centers.

=== Poland ===
In the Polish language, there is no linguistic distinction between a city and a town, both translated . The word for both is , as a form of settlement distinct from types of rural settlements: village (), &quot;przysiółek&quot;, &#x27;, or &#x27;, see Classification of localities and their parts in Poland. Cities are the biggest municipalities, distinguished through being managed by a city mayor (, literally translated city president) instead of a town mayor () as the head of the city executive, thus being informally called &quot;miasto prezydenckie&quot;, with such privilege automatically awarded to municipalities either inhabited by more than 100,000 residents (currently 37) or those enjoying the status of a city with powiat rights (currently 66). As of 2022, all of the former group fit into the latter, though it was not always the case in the past. There is, however, a number of exemptions due to historic or political reasons, when a municipality meets neither of these two conditions but nevertheless has the city status, including the only 3 capitals of the former voivodeships of Poland (1975–1998) not meeting the abovementioned criteria, as well as further 38 municipalities which do not fit into any of the mentioned categories but have nevertheless been allowed to keep the earlier awarded status due to unspecified historical reasons. Towns may sometimes be called , a diminutive colloquially used for localities with a few thousand residents. Such localities have a town mayor () as the head of the town executive.

Town/city rights are conferred by government legislation; new towns/cities are designated by the government in an annual regulation effective from the first day of the year. Some settlements tend to remain villages even though they have a larger population than many smaller towns, primarily in order not to lose eligibility for the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development. As of 30 April 2022, there are altogether 2477 municipalities (gmina) in Poland, including 1513 rural gminas, while the remaining 968 ones contain cities and towns. Among them, 666 towns are part of an urban-rural gmina while 302 cities and towns are standalone as an urban gmina. The latter group includes 107 cities (governed by a &quot;prezydent miasta&quot;), including 66 cities with powiat rights. 37 cities among the latter group are over 100,000, including 18 cities serving as a seat for voivode or voivodeship sejmik, informally called voivodeship cities.

=== Portugal ===
Like other Latin cultures, in Portugal a town () is a populated place larger than a village ( and smaller than a city (). Similarly, although these places are not defined under the Portuguese Constitution and have no political and administrative functions (with associated organs), they are defined by law, and a town must have:
* at least 3,000 voters
* at least half of these services: health unit, pharmacy, cultural centre, public transportation network, post office, commercial food and drinking establishments, primary school and/or bank office

In special cases, villages can receive the status of town if they possess historical, cultural or architectonic importance.

A Portuguese town or city is so merely an urban settlement located in the area of a municipality, in comparison to the North American context, where they have political functions.

A town can be enterily located inside the area of a single freguesia (subdivion of a municipality) or can occupy several freguesias.

Portuguese local governments heraldry reflects if the seat of the respective freguesia or municipality is a city, town or another type of settlement. The coat of arms of a local government with a seat in a town bears a mural crown with four towers, while the coat of arms of a local government with a set in a city bears a crown with five towers.

This difference between towns and cities is still in use in other Portuguese-speaking countries. In Brazil, since the beginning of the 20th century, all municipal seats receive the status of city.

=== Romania ===
In Romania there is no official distinction between a city and a town (the word for both in Romanian is ). Cities and towns in Romania can have the status either of , conferred to large urban areas, or only to smaller urban localities. Some settlements remain villages () even though they have a larger population than other smaller towns.

=== Russia ===

Unlike English, the Russian language does not distinguish the terms &quot;city&quot; and &quot;town&quot;—both are translated as (). Occasionally the term is applied to urban-type settlements as well, even though the status of those is not the same as that of a city/town proper.

In Russia, the criteria an inhabited locality needs to meet in order to be granted city/town () status vary in different federal subjects. In general, to qualify for this status, an inhabited locality should have more than 12,000 inhabitants and the occupation of no less than 85% of inhabitants must be other than agriculture. However, inhabited localities which were previously granted the city/town status but no longer meet the criteria can still retain the status for historical reasons.

===Singapore===
In Singapore, towns are large-scale satellite housing developments which are designed to be self-contained. It includes public housing units, a town centre and other amenities. Helmed by a hierarchy of commercial developments, ranging from a town centre to precinct-level outlets, there is no need to venture out of town to meet the most common needs of residences. Employment can be found in industrial estates located within several towns. Educational, health care, and recreational needs are also taken care of with the provision of schools, hospitals, parks, sports complexes, and so on. The most populous town in the country is Bedok.

===South Africa===
In South Africa the Afrikaans term is used interchangeably with the English equivalent &quot;town&quot;. A town is a settlement that has a size that is smaller than that of a city.

=== Spain ===
In Spain, the equivalent of town would be , a population unit between a village () and a city (), and is not defined by the number of inhabitants, but by some historical rights and privileges dating from the Middle Ages, such as the right to hold a market or fair. For instance, while Madrid is technically a , Barcelona, with a smaller population, is known as a city.

=== Sweden ===

The Swedish language does not differentiate between towns and cities in the English sense of the words; both words are commonly translated as , a term which has no legal significance today. The term is used for an urban area or a locality, which however is a statistical rather than an administrative concept and encompasses densely settled villages with only 200 inhabitants as well as the major cities. The word &quot;köping&quot; corresponds to an English &quot;market town&quot; &quot;(chipping)&quot; or German &quot;&quot; but is mainly of historical significance, as the term is not used today and only survives in some toponyms. Some towns with names ending in are cities with over 100,000 inhabitants today, e.g. Linköping.

Before 1971, 132 larger municipalities in Sweden enjoyed special royal charters as instead of &quot;kommun&quot; (which is similar to a US county). However, since 1971 all municipalities are officially defined as , thus making no legal difference between, for instance, Stockholm and a small countryside municipality. Every urban area that was a before 1971 is still often referred to as a in daily speech. Since the 1980s, 14 of these municipalities have branded themselves as again, although this has no legal or administrative significance, as they still have to refer to themselves as in all legal documentation.

For statistical purposes, Statistics Sweden officially defines a as an urban area of at least 10,000 inhabitants. Since 2017 it also defines a (literally &#x27;big town&#x27;) as a municipality with a population of at least 200,000 of which at least 200,000 are in its largest . This means that Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö are , i.e. &#x27;major cities&#x27;, while Uppsala, with a population of approximately 230,000 in the municipality, which covers an unusually large area, almost three times larger than the combined land area of the municipalities of Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö, is not. The largest contiguous urban area within Uppsala municipality has a population of well below 200,000, while the population of both Malmö municipality, with a land area only 1/14 the size of Uppsala municipality, and Malmö , i.e. contiguous urban area, is well over 300,000, and the population of the Malmö Metropolitan Area, with a land area only slightly larger than Uppsala Municipality, is well over 700,000. A difference in the size and population of the urban area between Uppsala and the smallest in Sweden, Malmö, is the reason Statistics Sweden changed the definition of in 2017.

=== Ukraine ===

In Ukraine the term &quot;town&quot; (, ) existed from the Medieval period until 1925, when it was replaced by the Soviet government with &quot;urban type settlement&quot;. Historically, a town in the Ukrainian lands was a smaller populated place that was chartered under the German town law and had a market square (see Market town).

=== United Kingdom ===
==== England and Wales ====


In England and Wales, a town traditionally was a settlement which had a charter to hold a market or fair and therefore became a &quot;market town&quot;. Market towns were distinguished from villages in that they were the economic hub of a surrounding area, and were usually larger and had more facilities.

In parallel with popular usage, however, there are many technical and official definitions of what constitutes a town, to which various interested parties cling.

In modern official usage the term &quot;town&quot; is employed either for old market towns, or for settlements which have a town council, or for settlements which elsewhere would be classed a city, but which do not have the legal right to call themselves such. Any parish council can decide to describe itself as a town council, but this will usually only apply to the smallest &quot;towns&quot; (because larger towns will be larger than a single civil parish).

Not all settlements which are commonly described as towns have a town council or borough council. In fact, because of many successive changes to the structure of local government, there are now few large towns which are represented by a body closely related to their historic borough council. These days, a smaller town will usually be part of a local authority which covers several towns. And where a larger town &quot;is&quot; the seat of a local authority, the authority will usually cover a much wider area than the town itself (either a large rural hinterland, or several other, smaller towns).

Additionally, there are &quot;new towns&quot; which were created during the 20th century, such as Basildon, Redditch and Telford.

Some settlements which describe themselves as towns (e.g. Shipston-on-Stour, Warwickshire) are smaller than some large villages (e.g. Kidlington, Oxfordshire).

The status of a &quot;city&quot; is reserved for places that have letters patent entitling them to the name, historically associated with the possession of a cathedral. Some large municipalities (such as Northampton and Bournemouth) are legally boroughs but not cities, whereas some cities are quite small — such as Ely or St David&#x27;s. The city of Brighton and Hove was created from the two former towns and some surrounding villages, and within the city the correct term for the former distinct entities is somewhat unclear.

It appears that a city may become a town, though perhaps only through administrative error: Rochester in Kent had been a city for centuries but, when in 1998 the Medway district was created, a bureaucratic blunder meant that Rochester lost its official city status and is now technically a town.

It is often thought that towns with bishops&#x27; seats rank automatically as cities: however, Chelmsford was a town until 5 June 2012 despite being the seat of the diocese of Chelmsford, created in 1914. St Asaph, which is the seat of the diocese of St Asaph, only became a city on 1 June 2012 though the diocese was founded in the mid-sixth century. In reality, the pre-qualification of having a cathedral of the established Church of England, and the formerly established Church in Wales or Church of Ireland, ceased to apply from 1888.

The word &quot;town&quot; can also be used as a general term for urban areas, including cities and in a few cases, districts within cities. In this usage, a city is a type of town; a large one, with a certain status. For example, central Greater London is sometimes referred to colloquially as &quot;London town&quot;. (The &quot;City of London&quot; is the historical nucleus, informally known as the &quot;Square Mile&quot;, and is administratively separate from the rest of Greater London, while the City of Westminster is also technically a city and is also a London borough.) Camden Town and Somers Town are districts of London, as New Town is a district of Edinburgh – actually the Georgian centre.

In recent years the division between cities and towns has grown, leading to the establishment of groups like the Centre for Towns, who work to highlight the issues facing many towns. Towns also became a significant issue in the 2020 Labour Party leadership election, with Lisa Nandy making significant reference to Labour needing to win back smaller towns which have swung away from the party.

==== Scotland ====

In Scotland the word &quot;town&quot; has no specific legal meaning and (especially in areas which were or are still Gaelic-speaking) can refer to a mere collection of buildings (e.g. a &quot;farm-town&quot; or in Scots ), not all of which might be inhabited, or to an inhabited area of any size which is not otherwise described in terms such as city, burgh, etc. Many locations of greatly different size will be encountered with a name ending with &quot;-town&quot;, &quot;-ton&quot;, &quot;-toun&quot; etc. (or beginning with the Gaelic equivalent etc.).

&quot;Burgh&quot; (pronounced &quot;burruh&quot;) is the Scots term for a town or a municipality. They were highly autonomous units of local government from at least the 12th century until their abolition in 1975, when a new regional structure of local government was introduced across the country. Usually based upon a town, they had a municipal corporation and certain rights, such as a degree of self-governance and representation in the sovereign Parliament of Scotland adjourned in 1707.

The term no longer describes units of local government, although various claims are made from time to time that the legislation used was not competent to change the status of the Royal Burghs described below. The status is now chiefly ceremonial but various functions have been inherited by current councils (e.g. the application of various endowments providing for public benefit) which might only apply within the area previously served by a burgh; in consequence a burgh can still exist (if only as a defined geographical area) and might still be signed as such by the current local authority. The word &#x27;burgh&#x27; is generally not used as a synonym for &#x27;town&#x27; or &#x27;city&#x27; in everyday speech, but is reserved mostly for government and administrative purposes.

Historically, the most important burghs were royal burghs, followed by burghs of regality and burghs of barony. Some newer settlements were only designated as police burghs from the 19th century onward, a classification which also applies to most of the older burghs.

=== United States ===
The definition of &quot;town&quot; varies widely from state to state, and in many states there is no official definition. In some states, the term &quot;town&quot; refers to an area of population distinct from others in some meaningful dimension, typically population or type of government. The characteristic that distinguishes a town from another type of populated place — a city, borough, village, or township, for example — differs from state to state. In some states, a town is an incorporated municipality; that is, one with a charter received from the state, similar to a city (see incorporated town), while in others, a town is unincorporated. They&#x27;re originally based around a population center and in most cases correspond to the geographical designations used by the United States Census Bureau for reporting of housing and population statistics. Municipalities vary greatly in size, from the millions of residents of New York City and Los Angeles to the few hundred people who live in Jenkins, Minnesota. In some instances, the term &quot;town&quot; refers to a small incorporated municipality of less than a population threshold specified by state statute, while in others a town can be significantly larger. Some states do not use the term &quot;town&quot; at all, while in others the term has no official meaning and is used informally to refer to a populated place, of any size, whether incorporated or unincorporated. In some other states, the words &quot;town&quot; and &quot;city&quot; are legally interchangeable. The Census of Governments treats jurisdictions called towns in the New England states, Minnesota, New York, and Wisconsin as townships rather than municipalities.

Small-town life has been a major theme in American literature, especially stories of rejection by young people leaving for the metropolis.

Since the use of the term varies considerably by state, individual usages are presented in the following sections:

====Alabama====
In Alabama, the legal use of the terms &quot;town&quot; and &quot;city&quot; is based on population. A municipality with a population of 2,000 or more is a city, while less than 2,000 is a town (Code of Alabama 1975, Section 11-40-6). For legislative purposes, municipalities are divided into eight classes based on population. Class 8 includes all towns, plus cities with populations of less than 6,000 (Code of Alabama 1975, Section 11-40-12).

====Arizona====

In Arizona, the terms &quot;town&quot; and &quot;city&quot; are largely interchangeable. A community may incorporate under either a town or a city organization with no regard to population or other restrictions according to Arizona law (see Arizona Revised Statutes, Title 9). Cities may function under slightly differing governmental systems, such as the option to organize a district system for city governments, but largely retain the same powers as towns. Arizona law also allows for the consolidation of neighboring towns and the unification of a city and a town, but makes no provision for the joining of two adjacent cities.

====California====
In California, the words &quot;town&quot; and &quot;city&quot; are synonymous by law (see Cal. Govt. Code §§ 34500–34504). There are two types of cities in California: charter and general law. Cities organized as charter cities derive their authority from a charter that they draft and file with the state, and which, among other things, states the municipality&#x27;s name as &quot;City of (Name)&quot; or &quot;Town of (Name).&quot; Government Code §§ 34500–34504 apply to cities organized as general law cities, which differ from charter cities in that they do not have charters but instead operate with the powers conferred them by the pertinent sections of the Government Code. Like charter cities, general law cities may incorporate as &quot;City of (Name)&quot; or &quot;Town of (Name).&quot;

Some cities change what they are referred to as. The sign in front of the municipal offices in Los Gatos, California, for example, reads &quot;City of Los Gatos&quot;, but the words engraved on the building above the front entrance when the city hall was built read &quot;Town of Los Gatos.&quot; There are also signs at the municipal corporation limit, some of which welcome visitors to the &quot;City of Los Gatos&quot; while older, adjacent signs welcome people to the &quot;Town of Los Gatos.&quot; Meanwhile, the village does not exist in California as a municipal corporation. Instead, the word &quot;town&quot; is commonly used to indicate any unincorporated community that might otherwise be known as an unincorporated village. Additionally, some people may still use the word &quot;town&quot; as shorthand for &quot;township&quot;, which is not an incorporated municipality but an administrative division of a county.

====Hawaii====

In Hawaii, the Department of Business, Economic Development, and Tourism has the statutory authority to establish, modify, or abolish the statistical boundaries for cities, town, and. villages. However, the only municipal government in Hawaii is the City ad County of Honolulu.

====Illinois====
In Illinois, the word &quot;town&quot; has been used both to denote a subdivision of a county called a township, and to denote a form of municipality similar to a village, in that it is generally governed by a president and trustees rather than a mayor. In some areas a town may be incorporated legally as a village (meaning it has at large trustees) or a city (meaning it has aldermen from districts) and absorb the duties of the township it is coterminous with (maintenance of birth records, certain welfare items). Evanston, Berwyn and Cicero are examples of towns in this manner. Under the current Illinois Municipal Code, an incorporated or unincorporated town may choose to incorporate as a city or as a village, but other forms of incorporation are no longer allowed.

====Indiana====
In Indiana, a &quot;town&quot; is differentiated from a &quot;city&quot; in that a town can not become a city until it has a population of at least 2,000. The form of government is also different from that of a city in that the town council is both the legislative and executive branches of government. The mayor is selected by the council from within its ranks and operates as a first among equals.

====Louisiana====
In Louisiana, a town is defined as being a municipal government having a population of 1,001 to 4,999 inhabitants.

====Maryland====

While a town is generally considered a smaller entity than a city, the two terms are legally interchangeable in Maryland. The only exception is the independent city of Baltimore, which is a special case, as it was created by the Constitution of Maryland.

====Nevada====

In Nevada, a town has a form of government, but is not considered to be incorporated. It generally provides a limited range of services, such as Land-use planning and recreation, while leaving most services to the county. Many communities have found this &quot;semi-incorporated&quot; status attractive; the state has only 20 incorporated cities, and towns as large as Paradise (186,020 in 2000 Census), home of the Las Vegas Strip. Most county seats are also towns, not cities.

====New England====
In the six New England states, a town is the most prevalent minor civil division, and in most cases, are a more important form of government than the county. In Connecticut, Rhode Island and seven out of fourteen counties in Massachusetts, in fact, counties only exist as boundaries for state services and chambers of commerce at most, and have no independent legal functions. In New Hampshire, Maine, and Vermont, counties function at a limited scope, and are still not as important in northern New England as they are outside of the northeast. In all six states, towns perform functions that in most states would be county functions. The defining feature of a New England town, as opposed to a city, is that a town meeting and a board of selectmen serve as the main form of government for a town, while cities are run by a mayor and a city council. For example, Brookline, Massachusetts is a town, even though it is fairly urban, because of its form of government. In the three southern New England states, the entire land area is divided into towns and cities, while the three northern states have small areas that are unincorporated. In Vermont and New Hampshire, the population of these areas is practically nonexistent, while in Maine, unincorporated areas make up roughly half of the state&#x27;s area but only one percent of the state&#x27;s population.

Though the U.S. Census Bureau defines New England towns as &quot;minor civil divisions&quot; for statistical purposes, all New England towns are municipal corporations equivalent to cities in all legal respects, except for form of government. For statistical purposes, the Census Bureau uses census-designated places for the built-up population centers within towns, though these have no legal or social recognition for residents of those towns. Similarly, the Census Bureau uses a special designation for urban areas within New England, the New England city and town area, instead of the metropolitan statistical area it uses in the rest of the country.

====New Jersey====
A &quot;town&quot; in the context of New Jersey local government refers to one of five types and one of eleven forms of municipal government. While &quot;town&quot; is often used as a shorthand to refer to a township, the two are not the same. The Town Act of 1895 allowed any municipality or area with a population exceeding 5,000 to become a Town through a petition and referendum process. Under the 1895 Act, a newly incorporated town was divided into at least three wards, with two councilmen per ward serving staggered two-year terms, and one councilman at large, who also served a two-year term. The councilman at large served as chairman of the town council. The Town Act of 1988 completely revised the town form of government and applied to all towns incorporated under the Town Act of 1895 and to those incorporated by a special charter granted by the Legislature prior to 1875.

Under the 1988 Act, the mayor is also the councilman at large, serving a term of two years, unless increased to three years by a petition and referendum process. The council under the Town Act of 1988 consists of eight members serving staggered two-year terms with two elected from each of four wards. One council member from each ward is up for election each year. Towns with different structures predating the 1988 Act may retain those features unless changed by a petition and referendum process. Two new provisions were added in 1991 to the statutes governing towns. First, a petition and referendum process was created whereby the voters can require that the mayor and town council be elected to four-year terms of office. The second new provision defines the election procedure in towns with wards. The mayor in a town chairs the town council and heads the municipal government. The mayor may both vote on legislation before council and veto ordinances. A veto may be overridden by a vote of two-thirds of all the members of the council. The council may enact an ordinance to delegate all or a portion of the executive responsibilities of the town to a municipal administrator. Fifteen New Jersey municipalities currently have a type of town, nine of which operate under the town form of government.

====New York====
In New York, a town is a division of the county that possesses home rule powers, but generally with fewer functions than towns in New England. A town provides a closer level of governance than its enclosing county, providing almost all municipal services to unincorporated communities, called hamlets, and selected services to incorporated areas, called villages. In New York, a town typically contains a number of such hamlets and villages. However, due to their independent nature, incorporated villages may exist in two towns or even two counties (example: Almond (village), New York). Everyone in New York who does not live in a city or Indian reservation lives in a town and possibly in one of the town&#x27;s hamlets or villages. New York City and Geneva are the only two cities that span county boundaries. The only part of Geneva in Seneca County is water; each of the boroughs of New York City is a county.

====North Carolina====
In North Carolina, all cities, towns, and villages are incorporated as municipalities. According to the North Carolina League of Municipalities, there is no legal distinction among a city, town, or village—it is a matter of preference of the local government. Some North Carolina cities have populations as small as 1,000 residents, while some towns, such as Cary, have populations of greater than 100,000.

====Oklahoma====
In Oklahoma, according to the state&#x27;s municipal code, &quot;city&quot; means a municipality which has incorporated as a city in accordance with the laws of the state, whereas &quot;town&quot; means a municipality which has incorporated as a town in accordance with the laws of the state, and &quot;municipality&quot; means any incorporated city or town. The term &quot;village&quot; is not defined or used in the act. Any community of people residing in compact form may become incorporated as a town; however, if the resident population is one thousand or more, a town or community of people residing in compact form may become incorporated as a city.

====Pennsylvania====
In Pennsylvania, the incorporated divisions are townships, boroughs, and cities, of which boroughs are equivalent to towns (example: State College is a borough). However, one borough is incorporated as a town: Bloomsburg.

====Texas====
In Texas, although some municipalities refer to themselves as &quot;towns&quot; or &quot;villages&quot; (to market themselves as an attractive place to live), these names have no specific designation in Texas law; legally all incorporated places are considered cities.

====Utah====

In Utah, the legal use of the terms &quot;town&quot; and &quot;city&quot; is based on population. A municipality with a population of 1,000 or more is a city, while less than 1,000 is a town. In addition, cities are divided into five separate classes based on the population.

====Virginia====

In Virginia, a town is an incorporated municipality similar to a city (though with a smaller required minimum population). But while cities are by Virginia law independent of counties, towns are contained within counties.

====Washington====

A town in the state of Washington is a municipality that has a population of less than 1,500 at incorporation, however an existing town can reorganize as a code city. Town government authority is limited relative to cities, the other main classification of municipalities in the state. most municipalities in Washington are cities (see: List of towns in Washington).

====Wisconsin====
Wisconsin has towns which are areas outside of incorporated cities and villages. These towns retain the name of the civil township from which they evolved and are often the same name as a neighboring city. Some towns, especially those in urban areas, have services similar to those of incorporated cities, such as police departments. These towns will, from time to time, incorporate into cities, such as Fox Crossing in 2016 from the former town of Menasha. Often this is to avoid annexation into neighboring cities and villages.

====Wyoming====

<text>Gervasio Antonio de Posadas y Dávila (18 June 1757, in Buenos Aires – 2 July 1833, in Buenos Aires) was a member of Argentina&#x27;s Second Triumvirate from 19 August 1813 to 31 January 1814, after which he served as Supreme Director until 9 January 1815.

Posadas&#x27; early studies were at the convent of San Francisco. Then he studied and practiced law with Manuel José de Labardén. In 1789 Posadas was appointed notary general for the bishopric, and held that post until the events of the May Revolution. He was unaware of the impending revolution and was caught by surprise when the Buenos Aires Cabildo (town hall) was occupied on 25 May 1810; he did not agree that it had been legitimately done. His donations to the &quot;Sociedad Patriótica&quot; made him an associate of the Saavedrist faction, so the leaders of the riots of 5 April 1811 exiled him to Mendoza. A month later he was appointed solicitor-procurator for the City of Buenos aires.

Like many other nineteenth century Argentines prominent in public life, Posadas was a freemason.

The Second Triumvirate commissioned Posadas, Nicolás Rodríguez Peña and Juan Larrea to draft a Constitution for consideration by the Asamblea del Año XIII, then he became part of the Triumvirate when the Assembly granted Executive Power to the Triumvirate. Then on 22 January 1814 the same Assembly decided to concentrate the Executive Power in him as a Supreme Director for the United Provinces, and so he took that office for a one-year period. During his rule, Saavedra and Campana were exiled, Montevideo fell to the United Provinces but serious problems arose with José Gervasio Artigas and the Liga Federal on the Banda Oriental. Moreover, Ferdinand VII of Spain regained his throne in 1815.

Posadas was succeeded in office by his nephew, Carlos María de Alvear, who was removed soon afterwards by a military &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;. By August 1815 the whole &quot;Alvearista&quot; faction was in disgrace and Posadas was jailed. The former Supreme Director spent the next six years in 22 different jails. He began writing his memoirs in 1829.

<text>Wah-wah (or wa-wa) is an imitative word (or onomatopoeia) for the sound of altering the resonance of musical notes to extend expressiveness, sounding much like a human voice saying the syllable &quot;wah&quot;. The wah-wah effect is a spectral glide, a &quot;modification of the vowel quality of a tone&quot;.

==Etymology==
The word is derived from the sound of the effect itself; an imitative or onomatopoeia word. The effect&#x27;s &quot;wa-wa&quot; sound was noted by jazz player Barney Bigard when he heard Tricky Sam Nanton use the effect on his trombone in the early 1920s.

==History==
===Acoustic===
The wah-wah effect is believed to have originated in the 1920s, with brass instrument players finding they could produce an expressive crying tone by moving a mute, or plunger, in and out of the instrument&#x27;s bell. In 1921, trumpet player Johnny Dunn&#x27;s use of this style inspired Tricky Sam Nanton to use the mute with the trombone.

===Electronic===

By the early 1960s, the sound of the acoustic technique had been emulated with electronic circuitry. For electric guitar the wah-wah pedal was invented.

==Technique==
The method of production varies from one type of instrument to another. On brass instruments, it is usually created by means of a mute, particularly with the harmon (also called a &quot;wa-wa&quot; mute) or plunger mute. Woodwind instruments may use &quot;false fingerings&quot; to produce the effect.

Any electrified instrument may use an auxiliary signal-processing device, or pedal. Often it is controlled by movement of the player&#x27;s foot on a rocking pedal connected to a potentiometer. An alternative to players directly controlling the amount of effect is an &#x27;auto-wah&#x27;. These devices, usually make harder hit notes more trembly with a more prominent wah wah effect. Wah-wah effects are often used for soloing or for creating a &quot;wacka-wacka&quot; funk rhythm on guitar. Although these electronic means are most often on electric guitar, they are also often used on electric piano.

==Theory==
The wah-wah effect is produced by periodically bringing in and out of play treble frequencies while a note is sustained. Therefore, the effect is a type of spectral glide, a &quot;modification of the vowel quality of a tone&quot;.

The Electronic wah-wah effects are produced by controlling tone filters with a pedal. An envelope follower circuit is used in the &#x27;auto-wah&#x27;. Subtractive synthesis can produce a similar effect.

==Notable uses==
Tricky Sam Nanton&#x27;s wah-wah on trombone in Duke Ellington&#x27;s Orchestra became well known as part of the so-called &quot;jungle&quot; effects of the band in the late 1920s. This technique has been used in contemporary music. Karlheinz Stockhausen notates the use of the wah-wah mute in his &quot;Punkte&quot; (1952/1962) in terms of transitions between open to close using open and closed circles connected by a line. Although the most common method of producing wah-wah on brass instruments is with a mute, some players have used electronic filtering, notably Miles Davis on trumpet.

<text>The East of England is one of the nine official regions of England in the United Kingdom. Additionally it makes up a part of the Southern England grouping (as opposed to the Midlands or Northern England). The East of England includes the ceremonial counties of Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Essex, Hertfordshire, Norfolk and Suffolk, of which Essex has the highest population. The northern part of the region, namely consisting of Norfolk, Suffolk and Cambridgeshire, is popularly known as East Anglia.

The population of the East of England region in was . Bedford, Luton, Basildon, Peterborough, Southend-on-Sea, Norwich, Ipswich, Colchester, Chelmsford and Cambridge are the region&#x27;s most populous settlements. According to Census 2021, Peterborough is the largest city in the East of England at 215,000. The southern part of the region lies in the London commuter belt. 

==Geography==

The East of England region has the lowest elevation range in the UK. Twenty percent of the region is below mean sea level, most of this in North Cambridgeshire, Norfolk and on the Essex Coast. Most of the remaining area is of low elevation, with extensive glacial deposits. The Fens, a large area of reclaimed marshland, are mostly in North Cambridgeshire. The Fens include the lowest point in the country in the village of Holme: 2.75 metres (9.0 ft) below mean sea level. This area formerly included the body of open water known as Whittlesey Mere. The highest point in the region is at Clipper Down at 817 ft (249 m) above mean sea level, in the far southwestern corner of the region in the Ivinghoe Hills.

Communities known as New Towns, responses to urban congestion and World War II destruction, appeared in Basildon and Harlow (Essex), as well as in Stevenage and Hemel Hempstead (Hertfordshire), in the 1950s and 1960s. In the late 1960s, the Roskill Commission considered Cublington in Buckinghamshire, Thurleigh in Bedfordshire, Nuthampstead in Hertfordshire and Foulness in Essex as locations for a possible third airport for London. A new airport was not built, but a former Royal Air Force base at Stansted, which had previously been converted to civilian use redeveloped and expanded in the following decades.

===Historical use===
The East of England succeeded the standard statistical region East Anglia (which excluded Essex, Hertfordshire and Bedfordshire, then in the South East). The East of England civil defence region was identical to today&#x27;s region.

===East Anglia with Home Counties===
Essex, despite meaning East-Saxons, previously formed part of South East England, along with Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire, a mixture of definite and debatable Home counties. The earliest use of the term is from 1695. Charles Davenant, in &quot;An essay upon ways and means of supplying the war&quot;, wrote, &quot;The Eleven Home Counties, which are thought in Land Taxes to pay more than their proportion...&quot; then cited a list including these four. The term does not appear to have been used in taxation since the 18th century.

==Climate==
East Anglia is one of the driest parts of the United Kingdom, with average rainfall ranging from . The area receives such low rainfall amounts because low pressure systems and weather fronts from the Atlantic lose a lot of moisture over land (and therefore are usually much weaker) by the time they reach Eastern England.

Winter (mid-November – mid-March) is mostly cool, but non-prevailing cold easterly winds can affect the area from the continent. These can bring heavy snowfall if the winds interact with a low-pressure system over the Atlantic or France. Northerly winds also can be cold but are not usually as cold as easterly winds. Westerly winds bring milder and, typically, wetter weather. Southerly winds usually bring mild air (if from the Atlantic or North Africa) but chill if coming from further east than Spain.

Spring (mid-March – May) is a transitional season that initially can be chilly but is usually warm by late-April/May. The weather at this time is often changeable (within each day) and occasionally showery.

Summer (June – mid-September) is usually warm. Continental air from mainland Europe or the Azores High usually leads to at least a few weeks of hot, balmy weather with prolonged warm to hot temperatures. The number of summer storms from the Atlantic, such as the remnants of a tropical storm, usually coincides with the location of the jet stream. The East tends to receive much less rain than the other regions.

Autumn (mid-September – mid-November) is usually mild with some days being very unsettled and rainy and others warm. At least part of September and early October in the East have warm and settled weather, but only in rare years is there an Indian summer where fine weather marks the entire traditional harvest season.

Dust devils were reported in Essex and Cambridgeshire on 17 August 2024, causing minor injuries and some disruption. These small whirlwinds, which form from the ground up, are less powerful than tornadoes. In Essex, they caused tents and gazebos to be lifted during a local event, resulting in minor injuries. Witnesses described the event as unexpected, noting that such phenomena are rare in the area.

== Politics ==
===Elections===

In the 2015 general election there was an overall swing of 0.25% from the Conservatives to Labour and the Liberal Democrats lost 16% of its vote. All of Hertfordshire and Suffolk became Conservative. The region&#x27;s electorate voted 49% Conservative, 22% Labour, 16% UKIP, 8% Liberal Democrat and 4% Green. Like other regions, the division of seats favours the dominant party in the region and the Conservatives had 52, Labour 4 (Cambridge, Luton South, Luton North and Norwich South), UKIP 1 (Clacton) and 1 Liberal Democrat (North Norfolk).

In the 2019 United Kingdom general election, the Conservatives gained Peterborough and Ipswich from Labour. They also gained North Norfolk from the Liberal Democrats but lost St Albans to Daisy Cooper.

==Governance and regions==

===East of England Plan===
The East of England Plan, a revision of the Regional Spatial Strategy for the East of England, was published on 12 May 2008. It was revoked on 3 January 2013.

===Local government===
The official region consists of the following subdivisions:

===Eurostat NUTS===
In the Eurostat Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS), the East of England was a level-1 NUTS region, coded &quot;UKH&quot;, which was subdivided as follows:

After the UK&#x27;s departure from the EU, the UK NUTS regions were renamed as International Territorial Level regions in 2021.

==History==
===Civil War and the Protectorate===
The East of England was a major force and resource for Parliament and, in particular, in the form of the Eastern Association. Oliver Cromwell came from Huntingdon.

===Second World War===
Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex played host to the American VIII Bomber Command and Ninth Air Force. The Imperial War Museum at Duxford has an exhibition, commemorating their participation and sacrifice, near to the M11 south of Cambridge.

Stansted Airport was RAF Stansted Mountfitchet, home to the 344th Bombardment Group. The de Havilland Mosquito was mainly assembled at Hatfield and Leavesden, although much of the innovative wooden structure originated outside the region from the furniture industry of High Wycombe; the Mosquito entered service in 1942 with 105 Sqn at RAF Horsham St Faith. RAF Tempsford in Bedford is the airfield from where SOE secret agents for Europe took off, with 138 Sqn which parachuted agents and equipment and 161 Sqn which landed and retrieved agents. 19 Sqn at Duxford was the first to be equipped with the Spitfire on 4 August 1938.

===Cold War===

The 81st Tactical Fighter Wing was at RAF Bentwaters from January 1952 and also at RAF Woodbridge; in the late 1980s some of the aircraft went to RAF Alconbury. Alconbury closed in 1992 and Bentwaters closed in 1993, with the American air forces being in the area for 42 years; the USAF aircraft subsequently moved to Spangdahlem Air Base in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany.

At RAF Marham in west Norfolk, 214 Sqn with the Vickers Valiant developed the RAF&#x27;s refuelling system; later the squadron would be equipped with the Handley Page Victor. Work on refuelling had also taken place at RAF Tarrant Rushton in Dorset.

From the 1950s, RAF Wyton was an important reconnaissance base for the RAF, mainly 543 Sqn. The base is now home of the Defence Intelligence Fusion Centre, previously known as JARIC, or the Joint Air Reconnaissance Intelligence Centre from 1956.

=== Official region ===
The East of England region was officially created in 1994 and was adopted for statistics purposes from 1999.

==Healthcare==

NHS East of England, which was the strategic health authority for the area until the abolition of these areas in 2013, is on Capital Park, next to Fulbourn Tesco, Fulbourn Hospital, and the Cambridge-Ipswich railway, on the eastern edge of Cambridge. The East of England Ambulance Service is on Cambourne Business Park on Cambourne, of the A428 (the former A45) west of Cambridge. The East Anglian Air Ambulance operates from Cambridge Airport and Norwich Airport; Essex Air Ambulance operates from Boreham.

==Economy==

The former electricity company for the area, Eastern Electricity, has the area&#x27;s distribution now looked after by UK Power Networks at Fore Hamlet in Ipswich. UK Power Networks also looks after London and most of the South-East. Business Link in the East of England is near to the headquarters of Ocado in Hatfield, at the roundabout of the A1057 and the A1001 on the Bishops Square Business Park. The region&#x27;s Manufacturing Advisory Service is at Melbourn in Cambridgeshire, off the A10 and north of Royston. UK Trade &amp; Investment for the region is in Histon with its international trade team based next to Magdalene College.

===Hertfordshire===

The Greater Watford area is home to British Waterways, Vinci (which bought Taylor Woodrow in 2008), the UK of the international firm Total Oil, retailers TK Maxx, Bathstore, Majestic Wine, Mothercare, Costco and Smiths Detection, Iveco, BrightHouse (at Abbots Langley), Leavesden Film Studios, Sanyo, Europcar, Olympus, Kenwood and Beko electronic goods manufacturers, Wetherspoons pub chains, the European HQ of the Hilton hotel group and Nestlé Waters; in Garston is the UK headquarters of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, on the A412 and the Building Research Establishment. Comet was previously, and Camelot Group (owners of the National Lottery) currently is, on the A4145, are in Rickmansworth. Ferrero (maker of Nutella and Kinder Chocolate) is in Croxley Green. Renault and Skanska (construction) are in Maple Cross.

At the 85-acre Capability Green off the A1081 and junction 10a of the M1, is the Stonegate Pub Company (owner of Scream Pubs, Yates&#x27;s, Slug and Lettuce and Hogshead), InBev UK (which bought most of Whitbread&#x27;s beer brands), Chargemaster (electric vehicle network under the POLAR brand), AstraZeneca&#x27;s UK Marketing Company division and Alexon Group (ladies clothing). Vauxhall produced its last Vauxhall Vectra in March 2002 at the plant near the A6/A505 roundabout, and now makes vans (Vivaro/Renault Trafic) at the former Bedford Vehicles plant, based in the north of the town at the GM Manufacturing Luton plant.

===East Anglia===
The economy in Norfolk, Cambridgeshire and Suffolk is traditionally mostly agricultural. Norfolk is the UK&#x27;s biggest producer of potatoes. Nationally known companies include the RAC, Archant (publishing), Virgin Money and Aviva (formerly Norwich Union) in Norwich. In Carrow, to the east of the city, Colman&#x27;s makes a wide range of mustards, and Britvic makes Robinsons squash, which was owned by Colman&#x27;s until 1995. Across the River Yare near the A47/A146 junction in Trowse with Newton is May Gurney, the construction company. Bernard Matthews Farms has a large turkey farm on the former RAF Attlebridge in Weston Longville. Campbell Soup was made in Kings Lynn until 2008, and on the Hardwick Industrial Estate at the A47/A149 junction is PinguinLutosa the UK, which packs frozen vegetables, and Caithness Crystal.

Foster Refrigerator is the UK&#x27;s leading manufacturer of commercial refrigerators and blast chillers, owned by Illinois Tool Works, based on the industrial estate; with Multitone Electronics, which has a manufacturing plant there, and which invented the pager in 1956, for St Thomas&#x27; Hospital; and Snap-on Diagnostics makes diagnostic tools for garages. British Sugar&#x27;s Wissington is the world&#x27;s largest sugar beet factory in Methwold, on the B1160 near the River Wissey. Lotus Cars and Team Lotus are on the eastern edge of the former RAF Hethel, east of Wymondham (A11) at Hethel (Bracon Ash). Jeyes Group makes household chemicals in Thetford, off the A134; Multiyork makes furniture and Baxter Healthcare has a manufacturing plant in the south of the town. Aunt Bessie vegetable products (roast potatoes) are made by Heinz at Westwick, in a factory built by Ross Group.
Around Cambridge on numerous science parks, are high technology (electronics and biochemistry) companies, such as ARM Holdings on Peterhouse Technology Park in the south-east of the town, Adder Technology (KVM switches) at Bar Hill at the A14/B1050 junction north of the town, Monsanto, Play.com on the Cambridge Business Centre. The Wellcome Trust Genome Campus has the European Bioinformatics Institute at Hinxton east of Duxford near the M11 spur for the A11. These form the so-called Silicon Fen. Marshall Aerospace is at Cambridge Airport on the A1303 in the east of the town, towards Teversham. South of the airport, Carl Zeiss NTS makes scanning electron microscopes in Cherry Hinton. Syngenta is to the east of Cambridge, on Capital Park at Fulbourn. Premier Foods has a large plant in Histon making Robertson&#x27;s and Hartley&#x27;s jam, Gale&#x27;s honey, Smash instant potato, and Rose&#x27;s marmalade. Addenbrooke&#x27;s Hospital is a pioneering hospital in the UK, based at Cambridge Biomedical Campus.


===Universities===
The most famous university in the region is the University of Cambridge. The university has been officially rated as the best in the world in 2010. It has the second-best medicine course in the world, and in 2010 became the only university outside of the US to raise over £1 billion in charitable donations.

There are eight universities in the region. Cambridge hosts two universities: the University of Cambridge and Anglia Ruskin University. It is also the home of the Open University&#x27;s East of England branch. Norwich also hosts two universities: the University of East Anglia and Norwich University of the Arts. There are also other towns and cities in the region which have universities including Bedford and Luton (University of Bedfordshire), Colchester (University of Essex) and Hatfield (University of Hertfordshire). Other higher education centres in the region include University Centre Peterborough, University of Suffolk and Writtle College.


The University of Cambridge receives almost three times as much funding as any other university in the region, due to its huge research grant—the largest in England (and the UK). The next largest, by funding, is UEA in Norwich. The University of Essex and Cranfield University also have moderately large research grants, but no other universities in the region do. The largest university by student numbers is ARU, and the next biggest is Cambridge. The smallest is Essex.

For total income to universities, Cambridge receives around £1 billion—around six times larger than any other university in the region. The University of Bedfordshire receives the least income. Cambridge has the lowest drop-out (discontinuation) rate in the region. Once graduated, over 50% of students stay in the region, with 25% going to London and 10% going to the South East. Very few go elsewhere—especially the North of England.

==Sport==

===Football===
During the nineteenth century, several formulations of the laws of football, known as the Cambridge rules, were created by students at the University. One of these codes, dating from 1863, had a significant influence on the creation of the original laws of The Football Association.

East of England&#x27;s top representatives in the English football league system today are Ipswich Town, Norwich City, Watford and Luton Town, who have competed in the top flight at various points. Alongside teams Peterborough United, and Cambridge United.

==Literature==
Children&#x27;s author Dodie Smith lived near the town of Sudbury in Suffolk, and part of her famous novel The Hundred and One Dalmatians which inspired the Disney animated film of the same name takes place in the town at St Peter&#x27;s Church.

==Media==
===Television===
Much of the region receives the BBC East and ITV Anglia television services, both based in Norwich (the BBC moving from All Saints&#x27; Green to The Forum in 2003, and Anglia remaining at its original base, Angia House.) These services broadcast from the Sandy Heath, Sudbury and Tacolneston transmitter groups. Some areas in close proximity to London, including Luton and south Essex, may receive their service from BBC London and ITV London; in addition, the Hemel Hempstead relay transmitter is a relay of the London services from Crystal Palace, bringing London television into parts of Hertfordshire. Northwestern parts of Norfolk including Kings Lynn receive a better TV signal from the Belmont transmitter that broadcast BBC East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire and ITV Calendar. Some editions of &quot;Look East&quot; and &quot;ITV News Anglia&quot; broadcast split news programming for the West (Home Counties) and East (East Anglia/Essex) of the region, with the West subregions broadcasting from Sandy Heath; the BBC&#x27;s Western opt-outs are broadcast from studios in Cambridge, also the base of BBC Radio Cambridgeshire, whilst both versions of the ITV Anglia output have broadcast from Anglia House in Norwich since the split service was introduced in 1990.

===Radio===
* BBC Local Radio services in the region include stations for Cambridgeshire, Essex, Norfolk, Suffolk and Three Counties Radio, which serves Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire. Radio Cambridgeshire previously broadcast some split programming specific to the Peterborough area - at one point broadcasting this under the BBC Radio Peterborough name - but this opt-out was withdrawn in 2012 as a cost-cutting measure.

<text>South East England is one of the nine official regions of England that are in the top level category for statistical purposes. It consists of the nine counties of Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, East Sussex, Hampshire, the Isle of Wight, Kent, Oxfordshire, Surrey and West Sussex. South East England is the third-largest region of England, with a land area of , and is also the most populous with a total population of in . 

South East England contains nine legally chartered cities: Brighton and Hove, Canterbury, Chichester, Milton Keynes, Oxford, Portsmouth, Southampton, Southend-on-Sea and Winchester. Officially it does not include London, which is a separate region. The geographical term for &quot;South East England&quot; may differ from the official definition of the region, for example London, Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire and Essex are sometimes referred to as being in the south east of England. This article only considers the South East as being the official statistical region.

In medieval times, South East England included much of the Kingdom of Wessex, which was the precursor to the modern state of England. Winchester was the capital of England after unification of the various states, including the kingdoms of Kent, Sussex and Mercia. Winchester stopped being the administrative capital of England some time in the 13th century as its influence waned while the City of London dominated commerce. The last monarch to be crowned at Winchester was Richard II in 1377, although the last monarch to be crowned by the Bishop of Winchester was Queen Mary I in 1553.

Today, the region&#x27;s close proximity to London has led to South East England becoming a prosperous economic hub with the largest economy of any region in the UK, after London. The region is home to Gatwick Airport and Heathrow Airport (the UK&#x27;s two busiest airports). The coastline along the English Channel provides numerous ferry crossings to mainland Europe. South East England is also known for its countryside, which includes two national parks: the New Forest and the South Downs, as well as the North Downs, the Chiltern Hills and part of the Cotswolds. The River Thames flows through the region and its basin is known as the Thames Valley. 

It is also the location of a number of internationally known places of interest, such as HMS &quot;Victory&quot; in Portsmouth, Cliveden in Buckinghamshire, Thorpe Park and RHS Wisley in Surrey, Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire, Windsor Castle in Berkshire, Leeds Castle, the White Cliffs of Dover and Canterbury Cathedral in Kent, Brighton Palace Pier, and Hammerwood Park in East Sussex, and Wakehurst Place in West Sussex. The region has many universities; the University of Oxford is the oldest in the English-speaking world, and ranked among the best in the world.

South East England is host to various sporting events, including the annual Henley Royal Regatta, Royal Ascot and The Derby, and sporting venues include Wentworth Golf Club and Brands Hatch. Some of the events of the 2012 Summer Olympics were held in the south east, including the rowing at Eton Dorney and part of the cycling road race in the Surrey Hills.

==History==
The Meonhill Vineyard, near Old Winchester Hill in east Hampshire on the South Downs south of West Meon on the A32, is an example of a site where the Romano-British grew Roman grapes.

===Second World War===
Much of the Battle of Britain was fought in this region, especially in Kent. RAF Bomber Command was based at High Wycombe. RAF Medmenham at Danesfield House, west of Marlow in Buckinghamshire, was important for aerial reconnaissance. Operation Corona, based at RAF Kingsdown (at West Kingsdown next to Brands Hatch in Kent, between the A20 and M20), was implemented to confuse German night fighters with native German-speakers, and coordinated by the RAF Y service.

Bletchley Park in north Buckinghamshire was the principal Allied centre for codebreaking. The Colossus computer, arguably the world&#x27;s first, began working on Lorentz codes on 5 February 1944, with Colossus 2 working from June 1944. The site was chosen, among other reasons, because it is at the junction of the Varsity Line (between Oxford and Cambridge) and the West Coast Main Line. The Harwell computer (Dekatron), now at the National Museum of Computing at Bletchley, was built in 1949 and is believed to be the oldest working digital computer in the world.

John Wallis of Kent introduced the symbol for infinity and the standard notation for powers of numbers in 1656. Thomas Bayes was an important statistician from Tunbridge Wells; his theorem (of probability theory) is used for spam filters and Google&#x27;s search.

Sir David N. Payne at the University of Southampton&#x27;s Optoelectronics Research Centre invented the erbium-doped fibre amplifier, a type of optical amplifier, in the mid-1980s, which became essential for the internet. Henry Moseley at Oxford in 1913 discovered his Moseley&#x27;s law of X-ray spectra of chemical elements that enabled him to be the first to assign the correct atomic number to elements in periodic table; he did not receive any Nobel Prize as it is not awarded posthumously (he was killed in 1915 at Gallipoli with the Royal Engineers). Carbon fibre was invented in 1963 at the RAE in Farnborough by a team led by William Watt. The Apollo LCG space-suit cooling system originated mostly from work done at RAE Farnborough in the early 1960s.
Donald Watts Davies invented packet switching in the late 1960s at the National Physical Laboratory in Teddington. Packet-switching was taken up by the Americans to form the ARPANET, the precursor to the Internet.

Surrey&#x27;s Alec Reeves invented pulse-code modulation (PCM) in 1937 (at ITT&#x27;s research laboratories in Paris), the standard for digital audio recordings.

Sir John Herschel, son of the astronomer, from Kent, invented the term &quot;photography&quot; in 1839, meaning &quot;light writing&quot;.
and discovered the first photographic fixer, sodium thiosulphate, known as &quot;hypo&quot;, also in 1839.

GLEEP was Britain&#x27;s first nuclear reactor, in August 1947 at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment (AERE) at Harwell, it would stay operational until 1990.

William Harvey of Folkestone, in Kent, discovered the circulation of blood. The Lilly Research Centre in Windlesham, Berkshire, part of Eli Lilly, developed Olanzapine in 1996 (for bipolar disorder, selling around $5bn worldwide annually). Beecham Research Laboratories at Brockham Park in 1959 discovered meticillin (or methicillin), the first semi-synthetic penicillin (beta-lactamase stable), deriving from their discovery in 1958 of 6-APA, the core constituent; the team, led by Prof George Rolinson, won the Mullard Award in 1971. Bipyridine compounds (Paraquat-Gramoxone and Diquat) were discovered for herbicide use in 1954 by William Boon at ICI&#x27;s Plant Protection division at Jealott&#x27;s Hill, being released onto the market in 1958. AZT/Retrovir (zidovudine) was first manufactured by Wellcome in 1987 in Kent; they also introduced Zovirax (aciclovir), and the naturally occurring digoxin, a cardiac glycoside. After a plane crashed near his house in Oxford in 1940, Sir Peter Medawar helped the injured pilot, and in the process discovered homograft rejection, leading to organ transplantation using azathioprine. Viagra (Sildenafil) was synthesized at Pfizer in Sandwich, Kent.

===Industrial heritage===
====Transport and communications====

Sir Francis Pettit Smith of Kent invented the screw propeller.

On 3 May 1830 the world&#x27;s first passenger train service, the Canterbury and Whitstable Railway (6 miles or 10 km) began. It was built by George Stephenson and hauled by the locomotive &quot;Invicta&quot;. It introduced the world&#x27;s first railway season ticket in 1834.

Maidenhead Railway Bridge, known for its flat arch, was built in 1839 with 39-metre spans.

The Military Vehicles and Engineering Establishment, in Chertsey, developed Chobham armour.

On 12 April 1903, the world&#x27;s first bus service was by Eastbourne Buses from Eastbourne railway station to Meads.

The world&#x27;s first submarine telephone cable was laid between England and France in 1891 by HMTS Monarch, enabling London-Paris calls from April 1891. On 3 December 1992, Neil Papworth of Reading, an engineer from Sema Group Telecoms at Vodafone in Newbury, sent the world&#x27;s first text message from his computer to an Orbitel 901 handset of Richard Jarvis, Vodafone&#x27;s technical director.

The first public automatic telephone exchange in the UK was at Epsom telephone exchange from 18 May 1912. It was introduced as standard across the UK&#x27;s 6,700 telephone exchanges in 1922, lasting for around 70 years; it could handle up to 500 lines. It used the Strowger design and was made by Automatic Telephone Manufacturing Company of Liverpool. The world&#x27;s first automatic telephone exchange had opened in La Porte, Indiana in November 1892.
UK-Belgium 5, laid in 1986 from Kent, was the world&#x27;s first optical fibre submarine cable, and is 36 miles long.

ThrustSSC, the fastest car in the world in 1997, was built in Aldingbourne, West Sussex, by G-Force Engineering, designed by Ron Ayers, with further work done by the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency at Farnborough.

The BritNed 1000MW power-supply submarine cable from Isle of Grain to Rotterdam, was built in 2009. The HVDC Cross-Channel (2000MW) submarine cable was built in 1986. This is the world&#x27;s highest-capacity submarine HVDC cable; it goes from France and lands near Folkestone, with the large transformer station (built by GEC) squeezed between the CTRL and the M20 in Aldington and Smeeth, made of eight 270 kV cables.
;Aviation
On 16 October 1908 the British Army Aeroplane No 1, flown by the American Samuel Franklin Cody, was the first aircraft flown in the UK, at Farnborough; on 14 May 1909 he flew it for more than a mile. On 13 August 1909, his wife was the first woman in the UK to fly in a plane, also at Farnborough.

The first human airborne ejection seat firing took place on 24 July 1946 over Chalgrove Airfield, Oxfordshire, in a Meteor, piloted by Bernard Lynch; the first dummy ejection had been 10 May 1945 over RAF Oakley in west Buckinghamshire (today near the M40); on 13 March 1962, the first in-flight rocket-powered ejection took place by Peter Howard, an RAF doctor based at Farnborough&#x27;s Institute of Aviation Medicine in Meteor &quot;WA364&quot; at 250 ft over Chalgrove, with the rocket giving a maximum force of 16G. The Miles M.52, designed at Woodley Aerodrome in Berkshire by Miles Aircraft, was an advanced design of aircraft which had the innovation of the &quot;flying tail&quot; or &quot;all-moving tail&quot; also known as a stabilator; this would solve the problem of stability and aircraft control at supersonic speeds, and its design was taken wholesale into the American Bell X-1, the first supersonic aircraft.

The first Harrier aircraft &quot;XV738&quot; flew on 28 December 1967; this was the first aircraft of the RAF to have a head-up display avionics system. The first two-seat Harrier &quot;XW174&quot; flew on 24 April 1969, later crashing at Larkhill in June 1969. The British Aerospace Sea Harrier &quot;XZ450&quot; first flew on 20 August 1978; on 4 May 1982 this aircraft was hit by anti-aircraft fire at Goose Green, killing the pilot with 800 Naval Air Squadron from HMS &quot;Hermes&quot;; the aircraft had no radar warning receiver (RWR), due to testing the Sea Eagle, so could not detect the Skyguard radar had locked on to it. It was destroyed with the Oerlikon GDF (35mm) of GADA 601; it was the first Sea Harrier lost in the Falklands campaign.

Royston Instruments of Byfleet developed the world&#x27;s first multi-channel flight data recorders in 1965.

Although the Comet is generally accepted as the world&#x27;s first production-run jet airliner, the first jet airliner ever built (individual) was a Nene-powered Vickers VC.1 Viking on 6 April 1948 from Wisley Airfield; the world&#x27;s first turboprop airliner would fly from there on 16 July 1948 by Mutt Summers. In 1939 at Cowes (Northwood) John Godeck invented the plan position indicator method of radar display as most commonly known ever since; the site became Plessey Radar in 1965, and currently is run by BAE Systems. Sperry Gyroscope in Bracknell produced the guidance systems for Britain&#x27;s 1960s space rockets.

====Other industries====
The Wealden iron industry in the Weald was the site of the first blast furnace in Britain in 1491, and produced much of Britain&#x27;s cast iron until the 1770s.

Portsmouth Block Mills were the site of the world&#x27;s first metal machine tools, built for the manufacture of wooden pulleys, invented by Henry Maudslay, and the site of the world&#x27;s first industrial assembly line in 1803.

South Foreland Lighthouse on 8 December 1858 was the world&#x27;s first lighthouse with electric light, with the first type of industrial electrical generator made by Frederick Hale Holmes, from work he had carried out with Floris Nollet of Belgium, and 36 permanent magnets. By 1880, of the ten lighthouses with electric light, five were in the UK. From the lighthouse in 1899, the first international radio broadcast to France was made. Zénobe Gramme of Belgium made a much better design in 1870 with self-excitation of magnets, and the first modern dynamo. North Foreland Lighthouse was the UK&#x27;s last-staffed lighthouse until 1998.

Portland cement was developed in Northfleet, Kent, by William Aspdin, son of Joseph Aspdin. The development was to heat the ingredients to around 1450 °C, producing clinker. Previously, temperatures were taken to only 800 °C, which was not enough. The first ever cement kiln is still in Northfleet today in a cardboard factory. In the late 1800s, the rotary kiln made the process much more efficient. Concrete, effectively human-made stone, is the most widespread human-made material. 5% of all carbon emissions worldwide are from concrete production.

The tallest freestanding structure in the region is the chimney of Grain Power Station at 801 ft; it is the second-tallest chimney in the UK after Drax power station.

George Albert Smith developed the first colour film process, known as Kinemacolor, in 1906 at Southwick, West Sussex. George E. Davis from Slough, is the founding father of chemical engineering. Wiggins Teape, later ARJO Wiggins Fine Papers, had the largest paper research centre in Europe at Butlers Court in Beaconsfield; built in 1891 and vacated in 2009. Bentalls in Bracknell (now Fenwick since 2017) had the first point of sale terminal in Europe - the NCR 280 in 1973.

The National Fruit Collection is the largest collection of fruit trees in the world, at Brogdale, and is next to the M2 at the A251 junction in Ospringe. Scalextric was invented by Fred Francis in 1956, who founded Minimodels in Havant; initially the model cars had been clockwork; it was made from 1967 at Triang in Margate. The world&#x27;s first Mars Bar was made in Slough in 1932; it was modelled on the Milky Way, popular at the time in the USA. Twix was introduced at Slough in 1967, with production moving to eastern France (Mars Chocolat France at Haguenau in Alsace) in 2005. The Ford GT40 was developed by Ford Advanced Vehicles at Slough in the mid-1960s.

==Geography==
The highest point is Walbury Hill in Berkshire at .

Britain&#x27;s tallest native tree, according to The Tree Register in April 2015, is a 144-ft beech at Devil&#x27;s Dyke in Newtimber Woods in West Sussex.

=== Settlements ===
Cities and towns in the region include Aldershot, Ashford, Aylesbury, Basingstoke, Bracknell, Brighton and Hove, Canterbury, Chichester, Crawley, Eastbourne, Farnborough, Gosport, Guildford, Hastings, High Wycombe, Margate, Maidstone, Medway, Milton Keynes, Newport, Oxford, Portsmouth, Ramsgate, Reading, Slough, Southampton, Winchester, Woking and Worthing.

===Historical boundaries===
Until 1999, there was a south east Standard Statistical Region, which also included the counties of Bedfordshire, Greater London, Essex and Hertfordshire. The former south east Civil Defence Region covered the same area as the current official region.

===Alternative definitions===
In unofficial usage, the South East can refer to a varying area – sometimes only to London, Kent, East Sussex, West Sussex, and Surrey; but sometimes to an area corresponding to the former Standard Statistical Region. The South East is also occasionally used as a synonym for the home counties.

==Demographics==


The population of the region at the 2011 census was 8,634,750 making it the most populous English region. The major conurbations of the region include South Hampshire (855,000), Brighton/Worthing/Littlehampton (474,000) and Reading (318,000). Settlements closer to London are part of the conurbation known as the Greater London Urban Area.

The South East has the highest percentage of people born outside of Britain other than London. According to the 2021 census, 78.8% of residents were White British, 7.1% Other White (inc. 0.8% Irish), 7.0% British Asian, 2.8% Mixed Race, 2.4% Black British, and 1.4% of other groups.

a There was no census in 1941.

===Cities and towns===
=== Ethnicity ===
===Religion===
==Governance and politics==
South East England is an official region for statistical and strategic planning purposes, but is not served by any directly elected regional government. From 1998 to 2010 local councils sent to the voluntary South East England Regional Assembly, based in Guildford. Delegates met six times a year and it was responsible for the South East England Development Agency, a project which oversaw investment projects in the region. It was abolished on 31 March 2009 and replaced with South East England Councils in Kingston upon Thames. The region is divided into several local council areas, most composed of two-tiered councils (the tiers are county councils and district councils) and unitary authorities:
===Westminster seats===

The South East of England is the most Conservative voting region of Britain in terms of both seats and votes. The area also has some seats where there is strong support for other parties, for example, Oxford, Slough and Southampton Test for Labour and Brighton Pavilion which is held by the Green Party. Out of 84 parliamentary seats, the Conservatives hold 72. In the 2017 general election, the Conservatives won 54.8% of votes, Labour 28.6%, Liberal Democrats 10.6%, Greens 3.1%, and UKIP 2.2%.

===Eurostat NUTS===
In the Eurostat Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS), South East England is a level-1 NUTS region, coded &quot;UKJ&quot;, which is subdivided as follows:


==Education==
===Schools===
Buckinghamshire, Medway and Kent, and Slough have an almost completely selective education system – not just a few grammar schools as other English areas may have – with secondary modern schools as the alternative. Kent has 33 grammar schools, Buckinghamshire 13, Medway 6 and Slough 4. The other areas are comprehensive. The top thirty schools at A level are almost exclusively selective schools; one or two are sixth form colleges. However, the results for each county as a whole are not always directly related to the number of grammar schools, as Kent and Medway perform below average at A-level. The King&#x27;s School, Canterbury claims to be oldest in England: 597 AD. Herschel Grammar School in Slough is the most oversubscribed school in England, with 14 people per place, Langley Grammar School in Slough is next with 13 per place, then Burnham Grammar School.

508,000 in the region are at state secondary schools (the highest in England) with 101,000 in Kent (the highest in England for a county and completely selective) then 70,000 in Hampshire, 60,000 in Surrey, 45,000 in West Sussex, 36,000 in Oxfordshire, 35,000 in Buckinghamsire. The lowest is 6,000 at Bracknell Forest, then Reading with about 6,000. Of all regions, the South-East has the greatest percentage that attend a grammar school: 12%; the next highest is the South-West with 6%. The most-educated people (NQF level 4 or above) in the region live in Elmbridge (51%), then Waverley, and Epsom and Ewell; 33% of people are at this level for the South-East, only second to London at 40%.

The region has the highest number of sixth formers, outside of London, in England; the highest number is in Kent, the highest for England, then Buckinghamshire (also completely selective), then Surrey. For state school pupils, there is patchy STEM participation. Hampshire has the most passing STEM subjects in England and in the region, followed by Kent, Surrey and Buckinghamshire. For STEM subjects, Portsmouth is lowest by some distance (6 people passed A level Chemistry) and is almost the worst in England. Southampton also gets low STEM subject results. Bracknell Forest gets low STEM results, for its economic prosperity, but does not include private schools.

For languages, the best is Kent: the county achieves the most A-level language passes in England, although Hampshire is a close second. Both counties get more German A level passes than the whole of North East England. Buckinghamshire and Surrey have high language A-level passes. Hampshire gets the most A-level passes in England (27,500), again more than North-East England (25,000). Although Hampshire is the best at languages, Portsmouth gets the fewest language passes in the region, and some of the lowest in England, with four French A levels, and has only 500 A level passes in total; next lowest are Slough, Bracknell Forest, and Southampton.
Reading School, a grammar, is the state school that gets the highest percentage (23%) into Oxbridge in 2010, behind 10 independents, and is also the oldest existing state grammar school in England; above it in the region, of the independent schools, are Magdalen College School, Oxford (32%), Guildford High School (26%) and Wycombe Abbey (25%). The Kendrick School, also in Reading, gets the 4th highest state school acceptance percentage to Oxbridge (18%) and the second highest in England outside of two grammar schools in London. Of the 25 state schools in the top 100 schools getting to Oxbridge, 7 are from the region. Many people from the north of East Sussex go to Kent&#x27;s grammars; some people on the London edge of Surrey attend grammars in Kingston upon Thames; and Buckingham&#x27;s two grammars attract people from nearby Milton Keynes; Buckinghamshire&#x27;s grammar schools get some of best admissions to Oxbridge in the UK. Surrey has twice as many acceptances into Oxbridge as the whole of Wales; acceptances to Oxbridge are concentrated in 10 counties in the South-East.

1% of those at school in the South-East gained no GCSE passes in 2010; Portsmouth was most with 2.5%, and Windsor and Maidenhead had the lowest with 0.2%. For school free school meals, the region has the lowest percentage in England with 7.2%; the highest percentage is Southampton with 17%, and the lowest is Wokingham with 3.5% (the second lowest in England after Rutland); Buckinghamshire is 4.3%, then Bracknell Forest and Surrey are 4.9%. For truancy, the highest is South Bucks at 7.0, then Canterbury 7.0, Portsmouth 6.9, Thanet 6.9, Southampton 6.4, and Rushmoor 6.1. The lowest truancy percentages are for Tandridge 2.5, Windsor &amp; Maidenhead 2.5, and Slough 2.5.

At GCSE, the area in the South East (and England) with the highest results is consistently Buckinghamshire. Berkshire is split into unitary authorities, and Wokingham, Windsor and Slough have the next best GCSE results. All of Berkshire&#x27;s unitary authorities have results above the England average, with West Berkshire considerably above average. Schools in Surrey and Hampshire also have consistently good GCSE results, and they are above average in Oxfordshire, West Sussex, Kent, Medway, and East Sussex. There are a small number of districts where results are significantly below average including the unitary authorities of Portsmouth (one of the lowest LEAs in the country), the Isle of Wight, Southampton, Brighton, and the districts of Oxford in Oxfordshire, Adur in West Sussex and Hastings in East Sussex.

There are forty-nine FE colleges in the region. The two main FE colleges are Northbrook College in Sussex and Basingstoke College of Technology in Hampshire. Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshore share an LSC (which fund FE colleges), and Sussex has a combined LSC. The region&#x27;s LSC office was in Reading, looking after five areas.

===Universities===
The best known university in the region is the University of Oxford, famous for its academic achievements, and also for its ornate colleges and its rowing crews on the Thames. It was ranked the fourth best university in the world by the Times Higher Education Supplement in 2013.

Other universities include:
*University of Brighton, Brighton and Eastbourne
*University of Buckingham, Buckingham
*Buckinghamshire New University, High Wycombe, Aylesbury, Uxbridge and Great Missenden
*Canterbury Christ Church University, Canterbury, Medway towns and Tunbridge Wells

*University of Portsmouth, Portsmouth
*Royal Holloway, University of London, Egham
*Solent University, Southampton
*University of Southampton, Southampton
*University of Surrey, Guildford
*University of Sussex, Brighton
*University of Winchester, Winchester

By total HEFCE funding, the biggest university is the Open University, followed by Oxford University. The Open and Oxford each receive around three times as much funding as any other university in the region, and Oxford receives the largest research grant in England (as of 2009). The University of Southampton gets the third largest amount of funding, with the next largest research grant, one of the largest in England. Other universities with a large research grant are Reading, Sussex and Surrey. Oxford gets twice as much total income (around £700 million) as the next largest, Southampton. Surrey and Reading get the next largest total income.

Oxford and Southampton have the largest numbers of students, followed by Brighton. Of total students in the region, around 45% are from the region and 35% from other regions. Of full-time first degree students in the region, over 35% are from the region, 15% are from London, and 10% each are from the East of England and the South-West; in total, around 70% are from the south of England. Very few are from the North-East or Scotland. Around 35% of the region&#x27;s native students stay in the region, with 15% going to London and over 10% going to the South-West. In general, for other regions of the UK, the South-East&#x27;s students are more prepared to study in other regions than those regions&#x27; students are prepared to study in the South-East. Once they graduate, over 50% stay in the South-East, with 25% going to London, around 5% going to the East of England, and around 10% going to the South-West; around 90% stay in the south of England.

==Economy==
Overall, the South East of England is a very prosperous area with the second largest regional economy in the UK (after London), valued at £177 billion in 2006. GDP per capita in 2007 was estimated at £22,624, compared with a UK average of £19,956, making South East England the second richest region per capita, behind London. However prosperity varies significantly across the region and despite its image of wealth there are large pockets of deprivation. GDP per capita in Berkshire and Milton Keynes is more than twice that of East Sussex and the Isle of Wight.

The region&#x27;s Manufacturing Advisory Service is on the A30 in Hook, north Hampshire The UKTI service for the region is on Victory Park in Whiteley, off junction 9 of the M27, opposite the &quot;Solent Hotel&quot;.

The South East Coast Ambulance Service has three headquarters, one each for Kent, Surrey and Sussex. These are on the B2163 at Coxheath (for Kent), on the A217 at Banstead (for Surrey), and on the A277 in Lewes (for Sussex). The South Central Ambulance Service is headquartered on the B4100 next to Bicester Town railway station, with offices at Otterbourne, Hampshire and Wokingham. The charity-funded air ambulances are Kent Air Ambulance at Marden, Kent; Hampshire &amp; Isle of Wight Air Ambulance at Thruxton, Hampshire; Surrey and Sussex Air Ambulance at Dunsfold Aerodrome, Surrey; and the Thames Valley Air Ambulance at RAF Benson.

Many high technology companies are located near the M3 in Surrey and the M4 in Berkshire. Sun Microsystems had their UK base in Blackwater near Camberley until 2009. Microsoft and Oracle have their UK headquarters next door to each other in Reading (Wokingham borough), as do the Yell Group and Logica (near junction 11 of the M4). The Gatwick Diamond is also a hub for hi-tech industry, centred at Gatwick Airport with Epsom to the north and Burgess Hill to the south. The largest company, by turnover, in the South East is Vodafone, followed by Ineos.
==Transport==

The main road transport routes are along the M1 through Buckinghamshire; the M40 through Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire; the M4 through Berkshire and Buckinghamshire; the M2 motorway/A2 and M20 through Kent; the M23 through Surrey and West Sussex; the M3 through Surrey and Hampshire. All these routes connect to the M25, which runs near to and occasionally through the region&#x27;s border with Greater London.

The A34 provides a north–south road link through Oxfordshire, Berkshire and Hampshire. The east–west corridor through the south of the region is provided by the A27 and the M27.

The main intercontinental airport is Gatwick Airport, with regional airports at Kent International Airport (Ramsgate), Shoreham Airport and Southampton Airport. Heathrow Airport is in Greater London but also serves (and is serviced by) the South East region.

The Great Western Main Line passes through Berkshire, Oxfordshire and southern Buckinghamshire. The South Eastern Main Line and High Speed 1 pass through Kent; the latter connects to the Channel Tunnel. The Brighton Main Line passes through Surrey and West Sussex. The North Downs Line runs from Berkshire then through Surrey to connect with Sussex and Kent. The West Coast Main Line passes through northern Buckinghamshire. The Chiltern Main Line is a major commuter line between Birmingham and London passing through central Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire. The Port of Dover and the port at Folkestone have many ferry services to France and though none currently run to Belgium.
As part of the transport planning system the Regional Assembly is under statutory requirement to produce a Regional Transport Strategy (RTS) to provide long term planning for transport in the region. This involves region wide transport schemes such as those carried out by the Highways Agency and Network Rail. Within the region the local transport authorities carry out transport planning through the use of a Local Transport Plan (LTP) which outlines their strategies, policies and implementation programme.

The most recent LTP is that for the period 2006–11. In the South East region the following transport authorities have published their LTP online: 
Bracknell Forest U.A., Brighton &amp; Hove U.A., Buckinghamshire, East Sussex, Hampshire, Isle of Wight, Kent, Medway U.A., Milton Keynes U.A., Oxfordshire, Portsmouth U.A., Reading U.A., Slough U.A., Southampton U.A., Surrey, Windsor and Maidenhead U.A., Wokingham U.A. and West Sussex.

<text>Now Wait for Last Year is a 1966 science fiction novel by American writer Philip K. Dick. It is set in 2055, when Earth is caught between two galactic powers in an interstellar conflict. Dr. Eric Sweetscent and his wife Kathy get addicted to a powerful drug that appears to cause time travel. The doctor&#x27;s patient is the world leader, UN Secretary General. Of the twenty-eight novels Dick published in the 1960s and 1970s, this novel is one of the five chosen to represent this period of his career in The Library of America series, Volume Two.

==Plot summary==

Set during a war between the &#x27;Starmen (inhabitants of the planet Lilistar) and six-limbed insectoid creatures called the reegs, &quot;Now Wait for Last Year&quot; is the story of Eric Sweetscent, an organ-transplant doctor who gets wrapped up in Earth-Lilistar politics.

At the onset of the story, Sweetscent is the personal org-trans surgeon for Virgil Ackerman, the president of Tijuana Fur &amp; Dye. Using an extraterrestrial amoeba which can imitate the cell-structure of anything it touches, TF&amp;D had been the largest manufacturer of synthetic furs on the planet. But like all major corporations on Earth, TF&amp;D has been requisitioned to produce for the war effort.

Ackerman invites Sweetscent to &quot;Wash-35&quot;, a recreation of his boyhood native Washington DC in a simulated 1935 and his vacation getaway on Mars, where he announces an ulterior motive in the retreat. Waiting for them when they arrive is a guest—Gino Molinari, the elected leader of Earth. Known as &quot;the Mole&quot;, he is rumored to have the enigmatic ability to come back from the dead, and he has requested the services of Sweetscent. Ackerman gladly passes Sweetscent on to Molinari.

Meanwhile, Sweetscent&#x27;s wife, Kathy, tries JJ-180, a new hallucinogenic drug which proves to be highly toxic and addictive. The effects of JJ-180 are not clear at first, however, only hours off of it, Kathy finds herself unable to function and violently craving JJ-180 again. She is visited by &#x27;Starmen who claim the reegs invented JJ-180 as a chemical weapon against the &#x27;Starmen and Terrans, also stating that there is no known cure for the drug&#x27;s addiction and &#x27;That&#x27;s why we put you on it&#x27;. Kathy is now a slave to JJ-180.

The &#x27;Starmen inform Kathy of her husband&#x27;s new position with Molinari and suspect the latter&#x27;s possible defection to the reegs. Kathy is promised more JJ-180 if she agrees to spy on her husband for Lilistar. Threatened with deportation, Kathy capitulates and agrees to their terms. Eventually, she takes a second dose of the drug as her ability to function becomes nearly impossible due to the effects of the withdrawal. Jumping into a taxi-cab, both she and the cab are plunged back in time to the 1930s. As the effects of the drug wear off, they slowly make their way back to the present time, uncertain as to whether the past they visited was their own or an alternate one.

An increasingly paranoid Kathy sets off to visit her husband.

Under his new employer Eric Sweetscent is let in on certain State secrets: Molinari seems to have a psychosomatic condition that mirrors any illness or disease of anyone in his vicinity. The effects of this condition appear to be real, yet the Mole pulls through every time, always returning from the brink of death.

Molinari, like everyone else, has realized that in siding with the &#x27;Starmen Earth has doomed itself to the wrong side of a losing war. However, there does not seem to be any safe way of defecting to the reegs, and Molinari fears that his deteriorating health will not instill confidence in the Terrans should the &#x27;Starmen retaliate, as they are certain to do. Sweetscent is shown footage of a healthier, younger Molinari in uniform and is led to believe that an android look-alike of the President has been created for public appearances, a notion that does not account for the fact that there is at least one other Molinari on the premises, a bullet-ridden corpse that is being preserved for use in the event of certain possible future developments.

Kathy arrives to inform her husband of her addiction, and in an effort to motivate him to find a cure she slips a pill of JJ-180 into his drink. Without enough time to be furious, Eric slips a year into the future of an alternate world where his colleagues inform him that he disappeared the day Kathy came to visit. Sweetscent also witnesses that in the new timeline Earth has sided with the reegs and Lilistar has lost the war.

Upon returning to the present of his own timeline, Sweetscent is eager to present this information to Molinari, who reveals that he too has been taking JJ-180, and that the effect is different for each user. Certain users are sent to the past, while others are sent to the future. Each trip is in an alternate universe, and therefore no one can effectively change their own past or future. However, aside from minor details, events in all observed universes seem to be moving in the same direction, and therefore, information obtained from one alternate world&#x27;s future will most likely be applicable to another.

In Molinari&#x27;s case he slips sideways in time under the drug&#x27;s influence and is able to pull alternate versions of his present self into his own timeline and then keep them there.

Having learned the secret to Molinari&#x27;s alter-aliases as well as confirming the feasibility of an alliance with the reegs, Eric takes a larger dose of JJ-180 which propels him further into the future. While there, he obtains a cure for JJ-180&#x27;s addiction, an item of wide accessibility in the future, as well as obtaining more information about the possible future of the war in his own timeline. He also gathers information as to the effects of JJ-180 on the brain as he is increasingly worried about Kathy&#x27;s mental condition. Taking a fraction of a pill so as to not immediately return to his own time, Eric again ends up one year in his own future where the &#x27;Starmen have occupied Earth after learning of the Terrans&#x27; defection to the reegs. He is arrested by a &#x27;Star patrol but saved by his future self, who informs him that Ackerman and the rest of the crew at TF&amp;D have taken a stand against Lilistar, using Ackerman&#x27;s getaway on Mars as their hideout.

Now knowing the general future history of the next few years, Eric returns to his own time where his wife&#x27;s mental condition is deteriorating every day. He resolves to check her into a clinic and is sent into deep reflection about the nature of their relationship. Feeling that he would be justified, he attempts to arrange an affair with a younger girl at Molinari&#x27;s recommendation. However, he backs out of it and begins to slip into a deep depression while reflecting on his life. He goes to Mexico to purchase poison with which to commit suicide. Deciding against it at the last second, Eric watches as the &#x27;Starmen begin their invasion of Earth.

Deciding that he is destined to join Ackerman&#x27;s resistance against the &#x27;Starmen, Eric enters an automated cab bound for TF&amp;D, asking it what it would do if its wife suffered from brain-damage without possibility of recovery (which Eric had confirmed by contacting his future self). After pointing out that robots do not marry, the cab hypothetically concludes that it would stay with her. Life, argues the cab, is made up of a series of circumstances, different for each person. To leave one&#x27;s wife would be to say that he requires a uniquely easier set of circumstances than what has been provided. That reasoning, to the cab, was an irrational way of thinking.

Eric agrees and decides to stay with his wife despite the challenges presented by her condition, and in the closing paragraph is commended by the cab for being a &#x27;good man&#x27;.

<doc id="52940" wikidata="Q352684" url="?curid=52940" title="Marcus Manilius">
<text>Marcus Manilius () originally hailing from Syria, was a Roman poet, astrologer, and author of a poem in five books called &quot;Astronomica&quot;.

==The &quot;Astronomica&quot;==

The author of &quot;Astronomica&quot; is neither quoted nor mentioned by any ancient writer. Even his name is uncertain, but it was probably Marcus Manilius; in the earlier books the author is anonymous, the later give Manilius, Manlius, Mallius. The poem itself implies that the writer lived under Augustus or Tiberius, and that he was a citizen of and resident in Rome, suggesting that Manilius wrote the work during the 20s CE. According to the early 18th-century classicist Richard Bentley, he was an Asiatic Greek; according to the 19th-century classicist Fridericus Jacob, an African. His work is one of great learning; he had studied his subject in the best writers, and generally represents the most advanced views of the ancients?????? on astronomy (or rather astrology).

Manilius frequently imitates Lucretius. Although his diction presents some peculiarities, the style is metrically correct, and he could write neat and witty hexameters.

The astrological systems of houses, linking human affairs with the circuit of the zodiac, have evolved over the centuries, but they make their first appearance in &quot;Astronomica&quot;. The earliest datable surviving horoscope that uses houses in its interpretation is slightly earlier, . Claudius Ptolemy (100–170 CE) almost completely ignored houses (&quot;templa&quot; as Manilius calls them) in his astrological text, &quot;Tetrabiblos&quot;.

=== A. E. Housman edition ===
The work is also known for being the subject of the most salient of A. E. Housman&#x27;s scholarly endeavours; his annotated edition he considered his magnum opus, and when the fifth and final volume was published in 1930, 27 years after the first, he remarked he would now &quot;do nothing forever and ever.&quot; He nonetheless also thought that it was an obscure pursuit; to an American correspondent he wrote, &quot;I do not send you a copy, as it would shock you very much; it is so dull that few professed scholars can read it, probably not one in the whole United States.&quot; It remains a source of bafflement to many that Housman should have elected to abandon (as they thought) a poet like Propertius in favour of Manilius. For example, the critic Edmund Wilson pondered the countless hours Housman devoted to Manilius and concluded, &quot;Certainly it is the spectacle of a mind of remarkable penetration and vigor, of uncommon sensibility and intensity, condemning itself to duties which prevent it from rising to its full height.&quot; This is, however, to misunderstand the technical task of editing a classical text. In the same vein, Harry Eyres interpreted it as &quot;what you could see as an act of self-punishment&quot; that so many years were devoted to &quot;a minor Roman versifier whose long didactic poem on astrology must rank as one of the most obscure in the entire annals of poetry&quot;.

==Honors==

An impact crater on the Moon is named after him: Manilius is located in the Mare Vaporum.

<text>The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane is a 1976 cross-genre film directed by Nicolas Gessner and starring Jodie Foster, Martin Sheen, Alexis Smith, Mort Shuman, and Scott Jacoby. It was a co-production of Canada and France and written by Laird Koenig, based on his 1974 novel of the same title.

The plot focuses on 13-year-old Rynn Jacobs (Foster), a child whose absent poet father and secretive behaviours prod the suspicions of her conservative small-town neighbours. The adaptation, originally intended as a play, was filmed in Quebec on a small budget. The production later became the subject of controversy over reports that Foster had conflicts with producers over the filming and inclusion of a nude scene, but a 21-year-old body double (Foster&#x27;s sister) was used. After a screening at the 1976 Cannes Film Festival, a court challenge was launched regarding distribution, and a general release followed in 1977.

Initially released to mixed reviews, with some critics finding the murder mystery plot weak but Jodie Foster&#x27;s performance more meritorious, the film won two Saturn Awards, including Best Horror Film and Best Actress for Foster. It subsequently attained cult status, with later critics positively reviewing the screenplay. Writers and academics have interpreted it as a statement on children&#x27;s rights and variously placed it in the thriller, horror, mystery or other genres.

==Plot==
On Halloween night, in a seaside town, Rynn Jacobs celebrates her thirteenth birthday alone. She and her father, Lester Jacobs, a poet, had recently moved to the village from England. Frank Hallet, adult son of their landlady Cora Hallet, visits unexpectedly and, finding her alone, makes sexual advances toward Rynn.

The following day Cora Hallet comes to the house, first obtrusively poking around the garden, then coming inside and aggressively probing Rynn with pointed questions about herself and her father. Rynn says he is in New York with his publisher and taunts the landlady about her son&#x27;s intentions. The situation becomes more tense when Mrs. Hallet insists on retrieving jelly glasses she left in the cellar. Rynn makes it obvious she is unwilling to let her landlady go down into the cellar, and Mrs. Hallet finally leaves. She returns later and opens the cellar trapdoor over Rynn&#x27;s objections. Upset by what she sees there, Mrs. Hallet attempts to flee, but in her haste she knocks down the support. The cellar door falls on her head, killing her.

Attempting to remove evidence of Mrs. Hallet&#x27;s visit, Rynn goes outside to drive her car away but cannot start it. This attracts the attention of Mario, a teenager passing by. Mario is the nephew of Officer Miglioriti, a village policeman who previously had given Rynn a ride home from town. Mario drives the car back to town, and Rynn rewards him with a dinner she prepares at her house.

Later, Officer Miglioriti stops by and tells them Frank Hallet has reported his mother missing. The officer asks to see Rynn&#x27;s father, but Mario covers for Rynn by saying her father has gone to bed. Later that night, Frank Hallet makes a surprise visit. Suspicious, and looking for answers about the whereabouts of his mother and Rynn&#x27;s father, Frank tries to scare Rynn into talking, cruelly killing her pet hamster. Mario chases Frank away.

Rynn now trusts Mario and confesses her actual situation. Rynn&#x27;s terminally ill father and abusive mother divorced long ago. To protect Rynn from being returned to her mother&#x27;s custody after his death, her father moved them to America and made arrangements to allow Rynn to live alone, then committed suicide in the ocean when the tides would carry his body out to sea. Her father also left Rynn a jar of potassium cyanide, telling her that it was a sedative to calm her mother if she ever came for her. Rynn coolly recounts how she put the powder in her mother&#x27;s tea and watched her die.

Trust between Rynn and Mario blossoms into romance. On a cold, rainy day, they bury the bodies behind Rynn&#x27;s house, but Mario catches cold. Suspicious of Rynn&#x27;s continued evasions regarding her father&#x27;s absence, Officer Miglioriti returns to the house one night and demands to see her father. Mario disguises himself as an old man and introduces himself to Miglioriti as Rynn&#x27;s father. After Miglioriti leaves, Rynn and Mario go upstairs, where they undress and get in bed together.

As winter sets in, Mario is hospitalized after his cold causes pneumonia. Rynn visits an unconscious Mario in the hospital making her feel lonely. That night, as Rynn is going to bed, she is shocked to find Frank emerging from the cellar. Frank thinks he knows what happened to Rynn&#x27;s parents and his mother and attempts to blackmail Rynn. He offers to protect Rynn&#x27;s secrets in exchange for her sexual favors. Rynn, seemingly defeated and resigned to Frank&#x27;s demands, agrees to have tea with him. Rynn puts some of the cyanide in her own cup and then takes the tea and almond cookies into the living room. Suspicious, Frank switches his cup with hers. Rynn watches intently as Frank succumbs to the poison.

==Themes==
Felicia Feaster, writing for Turner Classic Movies, found an &quot;unusual theme&quot; in the film, which she interpreted as being one of independence for children. Professor James R. Kincaid read the film as a call for children&#x27;s rights. T.S. Kord wrote the film argued that a child with money and a home does not need a parent if he or she does not believe it is necessary. The adults who attempt to intrude in Rynn&#x27;s affairs are a threat, including her mother, her landlord, and the molester.

Writer Anthony Synnott placed &quot;The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane&quot; in a trend of sexualizing children in film, calling Rynn the &quot;murdering nymphet&quot; and comparing her to Foster&#x27;s character Iris in &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; (1976). Anthony Cortese also referred to Foster as giving an &quot;encore performance&quot; of &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;, calling Rynn &quot;a 13-year-old imp of maturing sexuality&quot;. Scholar Andrew Scahill described it as fitting a cinematic narrative of children in rebellion, one in which the child appears seemly, as with &quot;The Innocents&quot; (1961), &quot;The Omen&quot; (1976), and others.

The genre has been debated, with Feaster arguing it was more psychological thriller than horror. Jim Cullen summed the film up as &quot;a strange hybrid&quot; of genres, being a horror, thriller, and feminist film. Kord listed it among dramas about &quot;Eerie, malevolent or criminal children&quot;, distinct from depictions of children in the supernatural horror genre. Martin Sheen said it was a horror film in some ways, but &quot;not overt&quot;, with mystery and suspense elements. However, director Nicolas Gessner denied it was horror, characterizing it as &quot;a teenage love story&quot;.

==Production==
===Development===
Novelist Laird Koenig adapted the book. Originally, the script was intended as a play, but this idea was abandoned due to the belief that a young actress would not be available to play Rynn for an extended period. Gessner read the book, only to find rights were optioned to Sam Spiegel, but the project was derailed due to creative differences, allowing Gessner to secure them.

The film followed tax incentives for cinema offered by the government of Canada, beginning in 1974, stimulating a &quot;Hollywood North&quot;. It was a co-production of Canada and France, with Zev Braun producing as head of Zev Braun Productions, based in Los Angeles, alongside L.C.L. Industries in Montreal and Filmedis-Filmel in Paris. Canadian producer Denis Héroux, who during the decade specialized in popular cinema with financiers from outside the country, also worked on the project. It was shot on a small budget. Financiers disliked how in the novel, Rynn murdered Mrs. Hallet with poisonous gas, causing the scene to be rewritten so the death is accidental.

===Casting===
Director Martin Scorsese was editing &quot;Alice Doesn&#x27;t Live Here Anymore&quot;, and Gessner&#x27;s look at his work led him to discover Jodie Foster. With the guidance of her mother Brandy, Jodie took the role of Rynn, and turned 13 while the film was being shot. 

Sheen said he was contacted by Gessner personally about playing Frank Hallet, which Sheen accepted because he found the part intriguing and because he believed Foster had a promising career. Gessner claimed Sheen was initially more interested in playing Mario, but Gessner persuaded Sheen that he was too old for that part. Gessner noted that casting Alexis Smith, who was born in Canada, also helped secure Canadian tax incentives.

===Filming===
&quot;The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane&quot; was filmed in Montreal, Knowlton, Quebec and Maine (specifically, Ogunquit, Maine). Sheen described the set as relaxed and as encouraging creativity, and said Foster also built a friendship with his daughter Renée Estevez during shooting.

A producer&#x27;s desire for &quot;sex and violence&quot; led to a nude scene depicting Rynn being added to the film. Foster strongly objected, later recalling, &quot;I walked off the set&quot;. As a result, her older sister Connie acted as the nude double. Her mother had suggested Connie, who was 21 at the time. Following the release of &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;, the industry shared stories of Foster having conflicts during the production of &quot;The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane&quot;. However, Gessner claimed Foster only regretted the scene after it was shot, and her request that it be deleted was denied by the Canadian producers.

The crew built a false trapdoor for Mrs. Hallet&#x27;s death scene, but Gessner acknowledged Smith was nervous about the effect. For the scene where Frank Hallet kills the hamster Gordon, Sheen handled a dead and frozen rodent, and attempted to make it seem like it was still alive. Sound effects of squealing were added. The dead hamster was obtained from a hospital which carried out animal research, and the live hamster portraying Gordon in other scenes was given to the costume designer after production.

===Music===

Mort Shuman, who played Officer Miglioriti, was a musician in real life, so the crew intended that Shuman would also write the film score. However, Shuman&#x27;s arranger Christian Gaubert wrote the bulk of the music, giving him the credit of composer, while Shuman was listed as the music supervisor.

Gessner wanted to use the music of Polish composer and pianist Frédéric Chopin, finding his music a good match with the dialogue. He said Chopin&#x27;s music was intended to symbolize hope and absolution, along with sadness. Chopin&#x27;s piano concerto No. 1 in E Minor was performed by pianist Claudio Arrau and The London Philharmonic Orchestra.

==Release==
After a screening at the Cannes Film Festival in May 1976, Astral Bellevue Pathé Limited sold distribution rights to &quot;The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane&quot;, allowing it to make $750,000 worldwide by June. The film was shown in Paris with a French dub on 26 January and in Toronto on 28 January 1977. According to &quot;Variety&quot;, Beachfront Properties secured a temporary restraining order which gave it ownership of the film per a contract from September 1976. This order forbade any new sales but did not change the American International Pictures release in April 1977. The film had trial screenings in Albuquerque and Peoria, Illinois, on 18 March 1977. It opened in Los Angeles on 11 May and in New York City on 10 August 1977, with a PG rating.

On its initial release, the film poster depicted &quot;The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane&quot; as a horror film, with an image of a building evoking the 1960 film &quot;Psycho&quot; and the subtitle &quot;She was only a little girl. She lived in a great big house...all alone. Where is her mother? Where is her father? Where are all the people who went to visit her? What is her unspeakable secret? Everyone who knows is dead.&quot;

A VHS release of the film removed the nudity, but it was re-added to the DVD. StudioCanal published a DVD in Region 2 on 20 October 2008. Kino Lorber released the film on Blu-ray in Region A on 10 May 2016. Hulu and Amazon Prime also made the film available to their customers in November 2016.

==Reception==
===Overall critical reception===
The film has a 93% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 15 reviews. Foster&#x27;s biographer Louis Chunovic referred to the film as &quot;much maligned&quot; in his 1995 biography on the star.

===Contemporary American reviews===
Janet Maslin for &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote this was Foster&#x27;s most natural portrayal of a child and that Sheen was frightening, and found the romance to be the greatest strength. In &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Gary Arnold called the film engaging, but claimed the murder plot is &quot;too glib, too immorally contrived, to be satisfying.&quot;

Kathleen Carroll gave the film a two-star rating out of four, and, in her review of it for the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, stated that &quot;Jodie Foster plays Rynn with her usual aplomb, but it seems a dreadful waste of her talent. What makes the movie even more reprehensible is that it shows her stripping off her blouse and casually getting into bed with a 17-year-old boy. As such, the movie appears to condone teenage sex, and, for that reason, parents should use great discretion in allowing young people to see it in spite of the mild PG rating.&quot;

Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it &quot;the exact movie equivalent of one of those slim, swift novels that are read on rainy Sundays or late at night or on vacation, for their pleasurable unimportance.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot;″s review stated that the story was unbelievable, and that the romance was one of the few positive aspects.

&quot;Time&quot;″s Christopher Porterfield felt the film failed to address the most interesting mysteries, and that doing so, combined with Foster&#x27;s acting, would have made the film memorable. Judith Crist&#x27;s review in the &quot;New York Post&quot; judged it to be &quot;a better-than-average thriller&quot;.

===Contemporary Canadian reviews===
Clyde Gilmour of &quot;The Toronto Star&quot; said that &quot;Jodie Foster alone emerges from this wishy-washy production with her renown intact. She handles her complex role with the cool adult professionalism that is her trademark. But the character itself is thinly developed in the script and remains an enigma at the obligatory freeze-frame fadeout.&quot; Martin Malina of the &quot;Montreal Star&quot; wrote that &quot;this odd little adolescent love story-cum-murder mystery depends very heavily for its effectiveness on the playing of its principal character, and Miss Foster doesn&#x27;t disappoint.&quot;

Julie Maskoulis of &quot;The Gazette&quot; wrote that &quot;without her unbelievable cool and calm self-sufficiency as the unusual adolescent of the story, the film would not be nearly as penetrating. It is hard to say how much of Foster&#x27;s stunning performance can be credited to director Nicolas Gessner, who brilliantly manipulates a build-up of suspense by insinuation and suggestion using Laird Koenig&#x27;s screenplay (based on his novel). He spares us visually gruesome de tails, thus making the impact of their retelling, within the film much more forceful.&quot;

Frank Daley of the &quot;Ottawa Journal&quot; called the film &quot;very slight&quot; but said it &quot;might do business in the U.S. on the strength of Foster&#x27;s name.&quot; Noel Taylor of the &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot; called the film &quot;a modest thriller with conventionally scarey moments&quot;, adding that &quot;director Nicholas Gessner builds his tension gently and is decently wary of sensationalism.&quot;

===Retrospective reviews===
Felicia Feaster of Turner Classic Movies remarked that &quot;The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane&quot; became a cult film, noting Danny Peary profiled it in his &quot;Guide for the Film Fanatic&quot;. Peary also listed it in his book &quot;Cult Horror Movies&quot;.

In 1992, James Monaco gave the film three and a half stars, assessing it as disturbing and complimenting the performances and writing. In their &quot;DVD and Video Guide 2005&quot;, Mick Martin and Marsha Porter awarded it three and a half stars, commenting it was &quot;remarkably subdued&quot;.

Author David Greven praised Foster for a performance &quot;achingly&quot; suggesting &quot;adolescent anomie&quot;. In his &quot;2015 Movie Guide&quot;, Leonard Maltin gave the film three stars, declaring it as a &quot;Complex, unique mystery&quot;.

<text>South West England, or the South West of England, is one of the nine official regions of England in the United Kingdom. Additionally, it is one of four regions that altogether make up Southern England. South West England consists of the counties of Cornwall (including the Isles of Scilly), Dorset, Devon, Bristol, Gloucestershire, Somerset and Wiltshire. Cities and large towns in the region include Bath, Bristol, Bournemouth, Cheltenham, Exeter, Gloucester, Plymouth and Swindon. It is geographically the largest of the nine regions of England with a land area of , but the third-least populous, with an estimated residents in . 

The region includes the West Country and much of the ancient kingdom of Wessex. It includes two entire national parks, Dartmoor and Exmoor (a small part of the New Forest is also within the region); and four World Heritage Sites: Stonehenge, the Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape, the Jurassic Coast and the City of Bath. The northern part of Gloucestershire, near Chipping Campden, is as close to the Scottish border as it is to the tip of Cornwall. The region has by far the longest coastline of any English region.

Following the abolition of the South West Regional Assembly in 2008 and Government Office in 2011, South West Councils provide local government coordination in the region. Bristol, South Gloucestershire, and Bath and North East Somerset are part of the West of England Combined Authority.

The region is known for its rich folklore, including the legend of King Arthur and Glastonbury Tor, as well as its traditions and customs. Cornwall has its own language, Cornish, and some regard it as a Celtic nation. The South West is known for Cheddar cheese, which originated in the Somerset village of Cheddar; Devon cream teas, crabs, Cornish pasties, and cider. It is home to the Eden Project, Aardman Animations, the Glastonbury Festival, the Bristol International Balloon Fiesta, trip hop music and Cornwall&#x27;s surfing beaches. The region has also been home to some of Britain&#x27;s most renowned writers, including Daphne du Maurier, Agatha Christie and Enid Blyton, all of whom set many of their works here, and the South West is also the location of Thomas Hardy&#x27;s Wessex, the setting for many of his best-known novels.

==Geography==

===Geology and landscape===
Most of the region is located on the South West Peninsula, between the English Channel and Bristol Channel. It has the longest coastline of all the English regions, totalling over . Much of the coast is now protected from further substantial development because of its environmental importance, which contributes to the region&#x27;s attractiveness to tourists and residents.

Geologically the region is divided into the largely igneous and metamorphic west and sedimentary east, the dividing line slightly to the west of the River Exe. Cornwall and West Devon&#x27;s landscape is of rocky coastline and high moorland, notably at Bodmin Moor and Dartmoor. These are due to the granite and slate that underlie the area. The highest point of the region is High Willhays, at , on Dartmoor. In North Devon the slates of the west and limestones of the east meet at Exmoor National Park. The variety of rocks of similar ages seen has led to the county&#x27;s name being given to that of the Devonian period.

The east of the region is characterised by wide, flat clay vales, and chalk and limestone downland. The vales, with good irrigation, are home to the region&#x27;s dairy agriculture. The Blackmore Vale was Thomas Hardy&#x27;s &quot;Vale of the Little Dairies&quot;; another, the Somerset Levels was created by reclaiming wetlands. The Southern England Chalk Formation extends into the region, creating a series of high, sparsely populated and archaeologically rich downs, most famously Salisbury Plain, but also Cranborne Chase, the Dorset Downs and the Purbeck Hills. These downs are the principal area of arable agriculture in the region. Limestone is also found in the region, at the Cotswolds, Quantock Hills and Mendip Hills, where they support sheep farming. All of the principal rock types can be seen on the Jurassic Coast of Dorset and East Devon, where they document the entire Mesozoic era from west to east.

===Climate===

The climate of South West England is classed as oceanic (&quot;Cfb&quot;) according to the Köppen climate classification. The oceanic climate typically experiences cool winters with warmer summers and precipitation all year round, with more experienced in winter. Annual rainfall is about and up to on higher ground. Summer maxima averages range from to and winter minimum averages range from to across the south-west. It is the second windiest area of the United Kingdom, the majority of winds coming from the south-west and north-east. Government organisations predict the region to rise in temperature and become the hottest region in the United Kingdom.

Inland areas of low altitude experience the least amount of precipitation. They experience the highest summer maxima temperatures, but winter minima are colder than the coast. Snowfalls are more frequent in comparison to the coast, but less so in comparison to higher ground. It experiences the lowest wind speeds and sunshine total in between that of the coast and the moors. The climate of inland areas is more noticeable the further north-east into the region.

In comparison to inland areas, the coast experiences high minimum temperatures, especially in winter, and it experiences slightly lower maximum temperatures during the summer. Rainfall is the lowest at the coast and snowfall is rarer than the rest of the region. Coastal areas are the windiest parts of the peninsula and they receive the most sunshine. The general coastal climate is more typical the further south-west into the region.

Areas of moorland inland such as: Bodmin Moor, Dartmoor and Exmoor experience lower temperatures and more precipitation than the rest of the southwest (approximately twice as much rainfall as lowland areas), because of their high altitude. Both of these factors also cause it to experience the highest levels of snowfall and the lowest levels of sunshine. Exposed areas of the moors are windier than lowlands and can be almost as windy as the coast.

===Regional identity===
The boundaries of the South West region are based upon those devised by central government in the 1930s for civil defence administration and subsequently used for various statistical analyses. The region is also similar to that used in the 17th-century Rule of the Major-Generals under Cromwell. (For further information, see Historical and alternative regions of England). By the 1960s, the South West region (including Dorset, which for some previous purposes had been included in a Southern region), was widely recognised for government administration and statistics. The boundaries were carried forward into the 1990s when regional administrations were formally established as Government Office Regions. A regional assembly and regional development agency were created in 1999, then abolished in 2008 and 2012 respectively.

It has been argued that the official South West region does not possess a cultural and historic unity or identity of itself, which has led to criticism of it as an &quot;artificial&quot; construct. The large area of the region, stretching as it does from the Isles of Scilly to Gloucestershire, encompasses diverse areas which have little more in common with each other than they do with other areas of England. The region has several TV stations and newspapers based in different areas, and no single acknowledged regional &quot;capital&quot;. Many people in the region have some level of a &quot;South West&quot; or &quot;West Country&quot; regional identity, although this may not necessarily correspond to an identification with the official government-defined region. It is common for people in the region to identify at a national level (whether English, British, Cornish or a county, city or town level). Identifying as being from &#x27;the Westcountry&#x27;, amorphous though it is, tends to be more predominant further into the peninsula where the status of being from the region is less equivocal.

In particular, Cornwall&#x27;s inclusion in the region is disputed by Cornish nationalists. The cross-party Cornish Constitutional Convention and Cornish nationalist party Mebyon Kernow have campaigned for a Cornish Assembly ever since the idea of regional devolution was put forward.

===Settlements===
The South West region is largely rural, with small towns and villages; a higher proportion of people live in such areas than in any other English region. There are two major regional cities in terms of population, which are Bristol and Plymouth (although Bristol is larger by some consideration), and two major conurbations which are the South East Dorset Conurbation (Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole) and the Bristol Metropolitan Conurbation (which includes the City of Bristol and areas of South Gloucestershire).

Cities and Towns with specific tourist and cultural sites of interest include Bath, Bristol, Salisbury, Plymouth, Exeter, Cheltenham, Gloucester and Weston-super-Mare, as well as the county of Cornwall on a widespread scale.

The region is home to eleven universities: University of Bath, University of Exeter, University of Bristol, Bournemouth University, Falmouth University (Cornwall), University of Plymouth, University of the West of England, University of Gloucestershire (Gloucester and Cheltenham), Arts University Bournemouth, Bath Spa University, Plymouth Marjon University, and Royal Agricultural University (Cirencester).

The largest cities and towns in order of population are:
#Bristol (483,000)
#Plymouth (278,000)
#Bournemouth (196,000)
#Swindon (184,000)
#Poole (152,000)
#Exeter (135,000)
#Gloucester (132,000)
#Cheltenham (119,000)
#Bath (94,000)
#Weston-super-Mare (82,000)
#Paignton (68,000)
#Torquay (65,000)
#Taunton (60,000)
#Weymouth (53,000).
#Yeovil (50,000)
#Salisbury (42,000)
#Bridgwater (41,000)
#Kingswood (41,000)

The largest conurbations are:
# City of Bristol and surrounds, sometimes called Greater Bristol or &quot;Bristol Built-up Area&quot;, which includes parts of South Gloucestershire (617,000)
# South East Dorset conurbation, covering Bournemouth, Poole and Christchurch (467,000)
# Plymouth (301,000)
#Gloucester Urban Area, covering Gloucester and Innsworth (169,000)
#Torbay, covering Torquay, Paignton and Brixham (122,000)

The population of the South West in 2009 was about five million.

===Transport===
The region lies on several main line railways. The Great Western Main Line runs from London Paddington to Bristol, Exeter, Plymouth, and Penzance in the far west of Cornwall. The South West Main Line runs from London Waterloo and Southampton to Bournemouth, Poole and Weymouth in Dorset. The West of England Main Line runs from London Waterloo to Exeter via south Wiltshire, north Dorset and south Somerset. The Wessex Main Line runs from Bristol to Salisbury and on to Southampton. The Heart of Wessex Line runs from Bristol in the north of the region to Weymouth on the south Dorset coast via Westbury, Castle Cary and Yeovil, with most services starting at Gloucester.

The vast majority of trains in the region are operated by CrossCountry, Great Western Railway (GWR) and South Western Railway (SWR). GWR is the key operator for all counties in the region except Dorset where SWR is the key operator.

CrossCountry operates services to Manchester Piccadilly, Glasgow and Aberdeen. Dorset is currently the only county in the region where there are electric trains, though the Great Western Main Line and the South Wales Main Line in Wiltshire, Somerset, Greater Bristol and Gloucestershire is being electrified. 
SWR operate services to and from London Waterloo and serves every county in the region except Gloucestershire and Cornwall. GWR serves all counties in the region and operate to various destinations, some of which run to South Wales and the West Midlands, though almost all intercity trains operated by GWR run through the region.

Transport for Wales also operates services between and . West Midlands Railway operated a parliamentary train between and via , which was withdrawn in 2019 (there was once a regular service on the route, but this was withdrawn in 2009).

It has been proposed that the former London &amp; South Western Railway Exeter to Plymouth railway be reopened to connect Cornwall and Plymouth as an alternative to the route via the Dawlish seawall that is susceptible to closure in bad weather.

Local bus services are primarily operated by FirstGroup, Go-Ahead Group and Stagecoach subsidiaries as well as independent operators. Megabus and National Express operate long-distance services from South West England to all parts of the United Kingdom.
Three major roads enter the region from the east. The M4 motorway from London to South Wales via Bristol is the busiest. The A303 cuts through the centre of the region from Salisbury to Honiton, where it merges with the A30 to continue past Exeter to the west of Cornwall. The A31, an extension of the M27, serves Poole and Bournemouth and the Dorset coast. The M5 runs from the West Midlands through Gloucestershire, Bristol and Somerset to Exeter. The A38 serves as a western extension to Plymouth. There are three other smaller motorways in the region, all in the Bristol area.

Passenger airports in the region include Bristol, Exeter, Newquay and Bournemouth.

Within the region the local transport authorities carry out transport planning through the use of a Local Transport Plan (LTP) which outlines their strategies, policies and implementation programme. The most recent LTP is that for the period 2006–11. In the South West region the following transport authorities have published their LTP online: Bournemouth U.A., Cornwall U.A., Devon, Dorset, Gloucestershire, Plymouth U.A., Somerset, Swindon U. A., Torbay U. A. and Wiltshire unitary authority. The transport authorities of Bath and North East Somerset U. A., Bristol U. A., North Somerset U. A. and South Gloucestershire U. A. publish a single Joint Local Transport Plan as part of the West of England Partnership.

==History==

===Pre-Roman===

There is evidence from flint artefacts in a quarry at Westbury-sub-Mendip that an ancestor of modern man, possibly Homo heidelbergensis, was present in the future Somerset from around 500,000 years ago. There is some evidence of human occupation of southern England before the last ice age, such as at Kents Cavern in Devon, but largely in the south east. The British mainland was connected to the continent during the ice age and humans may have repeatedly migrated into and out of the region as the climate fluctuated. There is evidence of human habitation in the caves at Cheddar Gorge 11,000–10,000 years BC, during a partial thaw in the ice age. The earliest scientifically dated cemetery in Great Britain was found at Aveline&#x27;s Hole in the Mendip Hills. The human bone fragments it contained, from about 21 different individuals, are thought to be roughly between 10,200 and 10,400 years old. During this time the tundra gave way to birch forests and grassland and evidence for human settlement appears at Salisbury Plain, Wiltshire and Hengistbury Head, Dorset.

At the end of the last Ice Age the Bristol Channel was dry land, but subsequently the sea level rose, resulting in major coastal changes. The Somerset Levels were flooded, but the dry points such as Glastonbury and Brent Knoll are known to have been occupied by Mesolithic hunters. The landscape at this time was tundra. Britain&#x27;s oldest complete skeleton, Cheddar Man, lived at Cheddar Gorge around 7150 BC (in the Upper Palaeolithic or Old Stone Age), shortly after the end of the ice age; however, it is unclear whether the region was continuously inhabited during the previous 4000 years, or if humans returned to the gorge after a final cold spell. A Palaeolithic flint tool found in West Sedgemoor is the earliest indication of human presence on the Somerset Levels. During the 7th millennium BC the sea level rose and flooded the valleys, so the Mesolithic people occupied seasonal camps on the higher ground, indicated by scatters of flints. The Neolithic people continued to exploit the reed swamps for their natural resources and started to construct wooden trackways. These included the Post Track and the Sweet Track. The Sweet Track, dating from the 39th century BC, is thought to be the world&#x27;s oldest timber trackway and was once thought to be the world&#x27;s oldest engineered roadway. The Levels were also the location of the Glastonbury Lake Village as well as two lake villages at Meare. Stonehenge, Avebury and Stanton Drew are perhaps the most famous Neolithic sites in the UK.

The region was heavily populated during the Neolithic, Bronze Age and Iron Age periods. Many monuments, barrows and trackways exist. Coin evidence shows that the region was split between the Durotriges, Dobunni and Dumnonii. The Iron Age tribe in Dorset were the Durotriges, &quot;water dwellers&quot;, whose main settlement is represented by Maiden Castle. Ptolemy stated that Bath was in the territory of the Belgae, but this may be a mistake. The Celtic gods were worshipped at the temple of Sulis at Bath and possibly the temple on Brean Down. Iron Age sites on the Quantock Hills include major hill forts at Dowsborough and Ruborough, as well as smaller earthwork enclosures, such as Trendle Ring, Elworthy Barrows and Plainsfield Camp.

At the time of the Roman invasion, the inhabitants of the entire area spoke a Brythonic Celtic language. Its descendant languages are still spoken to a greater or lesser extent in Cornwall, Wales, and Brittany.

===Roman period===

During the Roman era, the east of the region, particularly the Cotswolds and eastern Somerset, was heavily Romanised but Devon and Cornwall were much less so, though Exeter was a regional capital. There are villas, farms and temples dating from the period, including the remains at Bath.

The area of Somerset was part of the Roman Empire from AD 47 to about AD 409. The empire disintegrated gradually, and elements of Romanitas lingered on for perhaps a century. In AD 47, Somerset was invaded from the south-east by the Second Legion &quot;Augusta&quot;, under the future emperor Vespasian. The hillforts of the Durotriges at Ham Hill and Cadbury Castle were captured. Ham Hill probably had a temporary Roman occupation. The massacre at Cadbury Castle seems to have been associated with the later Boudiccan Revolt of AD 60–61.
The Roman invasion, and possibly the preceding period of involvement in the internal affairs of the south of England, was inspired in part by the lead mines of the Mendip Hills, which also offered the potential for the extraction of silver. Forts were set up at Bath and Ilchester. The lead and silver mines at Charterhouse in the Mendip Hills were run by the military. The Romans established a defensive boundary along the new military road known the Fosse Way (from the Latin &quot;fossa&quot; meaning &quot;ditch&quot;). The Fosse Way ran through Bath, Shepton Mallet, Ilchester and south-west towards Axminster. The road from Dorchester ran through Yeovil to meet the Fosse Way at Ilchester. Salt was produced on the Somerset Levels near Highbridge and quarrying took place near Bath, named after the Roman baths.

Excavations carried out before the flooding of Chew Valley Lake also uncovered Roman remains, indicating agricultural and industrial activity from the second half of the 1st century until the 3rd century AD. The finds included a moderately large villa at Chew Park, where wooden writing tablets (the first in the UK) with ink writing were found. There is also evidence from the Pagans Hill Roman Temple at Chew Stoke. In October 2001 the West Bagborough Hoard of 4th-century Roman silver was discovered in West Bagborough. The 681 coins included two denarii from the early 2nd century and 8 miliarensia and 671 siliquae all dating from AD 337 to 367. The majority were struck in the reigns of emperors Constantius II and Julian and derive from a range of mints including Arles and Lyons in France, Trier in Germany, and Rome. In April 2010, the Frome Hoard, one of the largest ever hoards of Roman coins discovered in Britain, was found by a metal detectorist. The hoard of 52,500 coins dated from the 3rd century AD and was found buried in a field near Frome, in a jar below the surface. The coins were excavated by archaeologists from the Portable Antiquities Scheme.

===British kingdoms and the arrival of the Saxons===
After the Romans left at the start of the 5th century AD, the region split into several Brittonic kingdoms, including Dumnonia, centred around the old tribal territory of the Dumnonii. The upper Thames area soon came under Anglo-Saxon control but the remainder of the region was in British control until the 6th century. Bokerley Dyke, a large defensive ditch on Cranborne Chase dated to 367, delayed the Saxon conquest of Dorset, with the Romano-British remaining in Dorset for 200 years after the withdrawal of the Roman legions. The Western Wandsdyke earthwork was probably built during the 5th or 6th century. This area became the border between the Romano-British Celts and the West Saxons following the Battle of Deorham in 577.

The Anglo-Saxons then gained control of the Cotswold area; but most of Somerset, Dorset and Devon (as well as Cornwall) remained in British hands until the late 7th century. According to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, the Saxon Cenwalh achieved a breakthrough against the British Celtic tribes, with victories at Bradford-on-Avon (in the &quot;Avon Gap&quot; in the Wansdyke) in 652, and further south at the Battle of Peonnum (at Penselwood) in 658, followed by an advance west through the Polden Hills to the River Parrett. The Saxon advance from the east seems to have been halted by battles between the British and Saxons, for example at the siege of Badon Mons Badonicus (which may have been in the Bath district, perhaps at Solsbury Hill), or Bathampton Down. The Battle of Bedwyn was fought in 675 between Escuin, a West Saxon nobleman who had seized the throne of Queen Saxburga, and King Wulfhere of Mercia. The earliest fortification of Taunton started for King Ine of Wessex and Æthelburg, in or about the year 710. However, according to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; this was destroyed 12 years later. Alfred the Great refortified Exeter as a defensive burh, followed by new erections at Lydford, Halwell and Pilton, although these fortifications were small compared to burhs further east, suggesting that they were protection for the elite only.

===9th century and the arrival of the Danes===
The English defeated a combined Cornish and Danish force at Hingston Down (near Gunnislake) in 838. Edward the Elder built similarly at Barnstaple and Totnes. But sporadic Viking incursions continued until the Norman Conquest, including the disastrous defeat of the Devonians at the Battle of Pinhoe. In 876 King Alfred the Great trapped a Danish fleet at Arne and then drove it out; 120 ships were wrecked at Studland. Although King Alfred had lands in Cornwall, it continued to have a British king. It is generally considered that Cornwall came fully under the dominion of the English Crown in the time of Athelstan&#x27;s rule, i.e. 924–939. In the absence of any specific documentation to record this event, supporters of Cornwall&#x27;s English status presume that it then became part of England. However, in 944, within a mere five years of Athelstan&#x27;s death, King Edmund issued a charter styling himself &quot;King of the English &quot;and ruler of this province of the Britons&quot;&quot;. Thus we can see that then the &quot;province&quot; was a territorial possession, which has long claimed a special relationship to the English Crown.
Corfe Castle in 978 saw the murder of King Edward the Martyr, whose body was taken first to Wareham and then to Shaftesbury. Somerset played an important part in stopping the spread of the Danes in the 9th century. Viking raids took place for instance in 987 and 997 at Watchet and the Battle of Cynwit.

King Alfred was driven to seek refuge from the Danes at Athelney before defeating them in 878 at the Battle of Ethandun, usually considered to be near Edington, Wiltshire, but possibly the village of Edington in Somerset. Alfred established a series of forts and lookout posts linked by a military road, or Herepath, to allow his army to cover Viking movements at sea. The Herepath has a characteristic form which is familiar on the Quantocks: a regulation 20 m wide track between avenues of trees growing from hedge laying embankments. A peace treaty with the Danes was signed at Wedmore and the Danish king Guthrum the Old was baptised at Aller. &quot;Burhs&quot; (fortified places) had been set up by 919, such as Lyng. The Alfred Jewel, an object about long, made of filigree gold, cloisonné-enamelled and with a rock crystal covering, was found in 1693 at Petherton Park, North Petherton. This is believed to have been owned by King Alfred. Monasteries and minster churches were set up all over Somerset, with daughter churches of the minsters in manors. There was a royal palace at Cheddar, which was used at times in the 10th century to host the Witenagemot.
===11th century===
In the late pre-Norman period, the east coast of modern-day England came under the growing sway of the Norsemen. Eventually England came to be ruled by Norse monarchs, and the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms fell one by one, Wessex being conquered in 1013 by King Sweyn Forkbeard. Sweyn&#x27;s realms included Denmark and Norway, and parts of England such as Mercia (an Anglian kingdom roughly coinciding with the English Midlands), much of which, along with northern England, fell under the Danelaw. Sweyn ruled Wessex, along with his other realms, from 1013 onwards, followed by his son Canute the Great. But Cornwall was &quot;not&quot; part of his realm of Wessex. A map by the American historian called &quot;The Dominions of Canute&quot; (pictured just above) shows that Cornwall, like Wales and Scotland, was part neither of Sweyn Forkbeard&#x27;s nor of Canute&#x27;s Danish empire. Neither Sweyn Forkbeard nor Canute conquered or controlled Scotland, Wales or Cornwall; but these areas were &quot;client nations&quot;: subject to payment of a yearly tribute or &quot;danegeld&quot; to Sweyn and later Canute, all three areas retained their autonomy from the Danes. Ultimately, the Danes lost control of Wessex in 1042 on the death of both of Canute&#x27;s sons. Edward the Confessor retook Wessex for the Saxons. In 1016 Edmund Ironside was crowned king at Glastonbury.

===Middle Ages===

After the Norman Conquest the region was controlled by various Norman as well as Breton lords and later by local gentry, a few of whom appear to have been descended from pre-Conquest families. In 1140, during the civil war of King Stephen&#x27;s reign, the castles of Plympton and Exeter were held against the king by Baldwin de Redvers and this gave rise to the defensive castles at Corfe Castle, Powerstock, Wareham and Shaftesbury. The period saw the growth of towns such as Truro, Totnes, Okehampton and Plympton in the west of the region, but these were small compared with the established wealth of ancient cathedral cities in the east of the region such as Exeter, Bath and Wells. Wealth grew from sheep farming in the east of the region: church controlled estates such as Glastonbury Abbey and Wells became among the richest in England, while tin and silver mining was important in Devon and Cornwall; Stannary Parliaments with semi-autonomous powers were established. Farming prospered until it was severely hit by the Black Death which arrived in Dorset in 1348 and quickly spread through Somerset, causing widespread death, with mortality rates perhaps as high as 50% in places. The resulting labour shortage led to changes in feudal practices. Crafts and industries also flourished; the Somerset woollen industry was then one of the largest in England. Coal mining in the Mendips was an important source of wealth while quarrying also took place.

Many parish churches were rebuilt in this period. Between 1107 and 1129 William Giffard, the Chancellor of King Henry I, converted the bishop&#x27;s hall in Taunton into Taunton Castle. It passed to the king in 1233 and in 1245 repairs were ordered to its motte and towers. During the 11th-century Second Barons&#x27; War against Henry III, Bridgwater was held by the barons against the King. During the Middle Ages sheep farming for the wool trade came to dominate the economy of Exmoor. The wool was spun into thread on isolated farms and collected by merchants to be woven, fulled, dyed and finished in thriving towns such as Dunster. The land started to be enclosed and from the 17th century onwards larger estates developed, leading to establishment of areas of large regular shaped fields. During this period a royal forest and hunting ground was established, administered by the Warden. The royal forest was sold off in 1818.
Where conditions were suitable, coastal villages and ports had an economy based on fishing. The larger ports such as Fowey contributed vessels to the naval enterprises of the King and were subject to attack from the French in return. Bridgwater was part of the Port of Bristol until the Port of Bridgwater was created in 1348, covering of the Somerset coast line, from the Devon border to the mouth of the River Axe. Historically, the main port on the river was at Bridgwater; the river being bridged at this point, with the first bridge being constructed in 1200. Quays were built in 1424; with another quay, the &quot;Langport slip&quot;, being built in 1488 upstream of the Town Bridge. In Bristol the port began to develop in the 11th century. By the 12th century Bristol was an important port, handling much of England&#x27;s trade with Ireland. During this period Bristol also became a centre of shipbuilding and manufacturing. Bristol was the starting point for many important voyages, notably John Cabot&#x27;s 1497 voyage of exploration to North America. By the 14th century Bristol was one of England&#x27;s three largest medieval towns after London, along with York and Norwich, with perhaps 15,000–20,000 inhabitants on the eve of the Black Death of 1348–49.
The plague resulted in a prolonged pause in the growth of Bristol&#x27;s population, with numbers remaining at 10,000–12,000 through most of the 15th and 16th centuries.
During the Wars of the Roses, there were frequent skirmishes between the Lancastrian Thomas Courtenay, Earl of Devon and Yorkist William, Lord Bonville. In 1470, Edward IV pursued Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick and George, Duke of Clarence as far as Exeter after the Battle of Lose-coat Field. The organisation of the region remained based on the shires and Church estates, which were largely unchanged throughout the period. Some of the most important nobles in the South West included the Courtenays Earl of Devon, William Bonville, 1st Baron Bonville, and Humphrey Stafford, earl of Devon whose wider influence stretched from Cornwall to Wiltshire. After 1485, the Earl of Devon, Henry VII&#x27;s chamberlain, Giles Daubeney, 1st Baron Daubeney and Robert Willoughby, 1st Baron Willoughby de Broke were also influential. In 1497, early in Henry VII&#x27;s reign, the royal pretender Perkin Warbeck, besieged Exeter. The Cornish Rebellion of 1497 led by An Gof and Thomas Flamank ended in a march to Blackheath in London where the Cornish forces were massacred.

===16th century===
Great disturbances throughout both Cornwall and Devon followed the introduction of Edward VI&#x27;s Book of Common Prayer. The day after Whit Sunday 1549, a priest at Sampford Courtenay was persuaded to read the old mass. This insubordination spread swiftly into serious revolt. The Cornish quickly joined the men of Devon in the Prayer Book Rebellion and Exeter was besieged until relieved by Lord Russell. The Cornish had a particular motivation for opposing the new English language prayer book, as there were still many monoglot Cornish speakers in West Cornwall. The Cornish language declined rapidly afterwards and the Dissolution of the Monasteries resulted in the eventual loss of the Cornish language as a primary language. By the end of the 18th century it was no longer a first language.

The Council of the West was a short-lived administrative body established by Henry VIII for the government of the western counties of England. It was analogous in form to the Council of the North. The council was established in March 1539, with Lord Russell as its Lord President. Members included Thomas Derby, Sir Piers Edgcumbe, Sir Richard Pollard and John Rowe. However, the fall of Thomas Cromwell, the chief political supporter of government by Councils, and the tranquillity of the western counties made it largely superfluous. It last sat in summer 1540, although it was never formally abolished.

===17th century===
The Bristol Channel floods of 1607 are believed to have affected large parts of the Somerset Levels, with flooding up to above sea level. In 1625, a House of Correction was established in Shepton Mallet, and when it closed HMP Shepton Mallet was England&#x27;s oldest prison still in use.

During the English Civil War, Somerset was largely Parliamentarian, although Dunster was a Royalist stronghold. The county saw important battles between the Royalists and the Parliamentarians, notably at Lansdowne in 1643 and Langport in 1645. Bristol was occupied by Royalist military, after they overran Royal Fort, the last Parliamentarian stronghold in the city. Taunton Castle had fallen into ruin by 1600 but it was repaired during the Civil War. The castle changed hands several times during 1642–45 along with the town. During the Siege of Taunton it was defended by Robert Blake, from July 1644 to July 1645. After the war, in 1662, the keep was demolished and only the base remains. This war resulted in castles being slighted (destroyed to prevent their re-use).
In 1685, the Duke of Monmouth led the Monmouth Rebellion in which a force partly raised in Somerset fought against James II. The rebels landed at Lyme Regis and travelled north hoping to capture Bristol and Bath, Puritan soldiers damaged the west front of Wells Cathedral, tore lead from the roof to make bullets, broke the windows, smashed the organ and the furnishings, and for a time stabled their horses in the nave. They were defeated in the Battle of Sedgemoor at Westonzoyland, the last battle fought on English soil. The Bloody Assizes which followed saw the losers being sentenced to death or transportation. At the time of the Glorious Revolution, King James II gathered his main forces, altogether about 19,000 men, at Salisbury, James himself arriving there on 19 November 1688. The first blood was shed at the Wincanton Skirmish in Somerset. In Salisbury, James heard that some of his officers, such as Edward Hyde, had deserted, and he broke out in a nose-bleed which he took as a bad omen. His commander in chief, the Earl of Feversham, advised retreat on 23 November, and the next day John Churchill deserted to William. On 26 November, James&#x27;s daughter Princess Anne did the same, and James returned to London the same day, never again to be at the head of a serious military force in England.

===Modern history===
Since 1650, the City of Plymouth has grown to become the largest city in Devon, mainly due to the naval base at Devonport. Her Majesty&#x27;s Naval Base (HMNB) Devonport is one of three operating bases in the United Kingdom for the Royal Navy. HMNB Devonport is now the largest naval base in Western Europe. The large Portland Harbour, built at the end of the 19th century and protected by Nothe Fort and the Verne Citadel, was for many years, including during the wars, another of the largest Royal Navy bases.

The 19th century saw improvements to roads in the region with the introduction of turnpikes and the building of canals and railways. The usefulness of the canals was short-lived, though they have now been restored for recreation. Chard claims to be the birthplace of powered flight, in 1848 when the Victorian aeronautical pioneer John Stringfellow first demonstrated that engine-powered flight was possible through his work on the Aerial Steam Carriage. North Petherton was the first town in England (and one of the few ever) to be lit by acetylene gas lighting.

Around the 1860s, at the height of the iron and steel era, a pier and a deep-water dock were built, at Portishead to accommodate the large ships that had difficulty in reaching Bristol Harbour. The Portishead power stations were coal-fed power stations built next to the dock. Industrial activities ceased in the dock with the closure of the power stations. The Port of Bristol Authority finally closed the dock in 1992, and it has now been developed into a marina and residential area.

During the First World War many soldiers from the South West were killed, and war memorials were put up in most of the towns and villages; only a few villages escaped casualties. There were also casualties – though much fewer – during the Second World War, who were added to the memorials. Several areas were bases for troops preparing for the 1944 D-Day landings. Exercise Tiger, or Operation Tiger, was the code names for a full-scale rehearsal in 1944 for the D-Day invasion of Normandy. The British Government evacuated approximately 3,000 local residents in the area of Slapton, now South Hams District of Devon. Some of them had never left their villages before. Bristol&#x27;s city centre suffered severe damage from Luftwaffe bombing during the Bristol Blitz of World War II. The Royal Ordnance Factory ROF Bridgwater was constructed early in World War II for the Ministry of Supply. The Taunton Stop Line was set up to resist a potential German invasion, and the remains of its pill boxes can still be seen, as well as others along the coast.

Exmoor was one of the first British National Parks, designated in 1954, under the 1949 National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act. and is named after its main river. It was expanded in 1991 and in 1993 Exmoor was designated as an Environmentally Sensitive Area. The Quantock Hills were designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) in 1956, the first such designation in England under the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. The Mendip Hills followed with AONB designation in 1972.

===World War II===

Much of the Battle of the Beams was carried out at the Telecommunications Research Establishment at Worth Matravers in Dorset; the H2S radar was developed by Sir Bernard Lovell of Bristol. The Gloster Meteor at Newquay Air Museum is the oldest flying jet aircraft in the world. Long Ashton Research Station in Somerset invented Ribena (for population health in World War II) and improved cider.

===Scientific heritage===
William Herschel, previously a clarinet player, of Bath discovered infrared radiation on 11 February 1800, and the planet Uranus in March 1781; he had made important improvements to the reflecting telescope by increasing the mirror diameter. Herschel then built a 20-ft reflecting telescope and invented the star count, working out that the Milky Way is a disc, which he called a &quot;grindstone&quot;, and that it is a galaxy. Sir Arthur C. Clarke of Minehead invented the idea of artificial satellites; he sent a letter to Harry Wexler who then developed the first weather satellite TIROS-1. Sir Arthur Eddington of Weston-super-Mare was the first to realise that nuclear fusion powered the Sun; at the 1920 British Association meeting he said that the Sun converted hydrogen into helium, although the mechanism was not known until 1933. James Bradley was an important astronomer from Gloucestershire, who discovered the aberration of light.

Jan Ingenhousz, the Dutch biologist, discovered photosynthesis in 1779 at Bowood House in Wiltshire; on 1 August 1774, Joseph Priestley discovered oxygen there too. A fossil of the oldest ancestor of the Tyrannosaurus was found in Gloucestershire; Mary Anning was a famous fossil collector from Lyme Regis. Edward Jenner, pioneer of vaccination, was from Gloucestershire.

===Industrial heritage===
Sir Benjamin Baker from Cheltenham jointly-designed the 1890 Forth Bridge. William Murdoch in 1792 lit his house in Redruth with gas, the first in Britain. Plasticine was invented 1897 in Bath by William Harbutt. Thomas Young of Somerset is known for his double-slit experiment in optics, and in solid mechanics for his famous Young&#x27;s modulus. Henry Fox Talbot, inventor of a negative-positive process in 1841, from Wiltshire made the first photograph in August 1835; Nicéphore Niépce of France can claim the first photo in 1826; William Friese-Greene of Bristol is thought to be the &quot;father of cinematography&quot; after inventing his &quot;chronophotographic camera&quot; in 1889.

Hinkley Point A nuclear power station was a Magnox power station constructed between 1957 and 1962 and operating until ceasing generation in 2000. Hinkley Point B is an Advanced Gas-cooled Reactor (AGR) which was designed to generate 1250 MW of electricity (MWe). Construction of Hinkley Point B started in 1967. In September 2008 it was announced, by Électricité de France (EDF), that a third, twin-unit European Pressurised Reactor (EPR) power station known as Hinkley Point C is planned, to replace Hinkley Point B which was due for closure in 2016, now extended until 2022.
In 1989 the Berkeley nuclear power station was the first in the UK to be decommissioned. The steam-generating heavy water reactor was developed at Winfrith in Dorset.

Ted Codd, inventor of databases and SQL, was from Poole. Campden BRI at Ebrington in north-east Gloucestershire was an important research centre for canned food; J. S. Fry &amp; Sons of Bristol made world&#x27;s first chocolate bar in 1847.

The first carpets were made in Britain in 1741 at Wilton, Wiltshire. In 1698, Thomas Savery of Devon developed an early steam engine; Thomas Newcomen from Dartmouth made another early steam engine in 1710. Edward Butler, a farmer from Devon born in Bickington in 1862, invented the petrol engine.

==Demographics==

At the 2021 census, the population of the South West region was 5,701,186 
It has long been one of the fastest-growing regions in England and its 2021 population had increased by 7.8% since 2011 (when it was 5,288,935), and by 15.7% over the 2001 figure (4,928,434).

At the 2021 census, the proportion of white people in the region decreased from 95.4% to 93.1%, while the proportion of black and Asian residents increased significantly. At that time, 87.8% of the region&#x27;s residents were classed as White British, which was higher than the England average of 73.5%.

The region had the oldest median age in England; in the 2011 census, West Somerset had the UK&#x27;s oldest average age – almost 48. The region had the second-highest proportion (23%) of rural population in the UK, after Northern Ireland.
=== Ethnicity ===
===Religion===
===Housing===
35% of people in the region own their homes outright, with no debt, the highest in the UK. The Cotswold district had the biggest house price increases in the region, and the second-biggest in the UK outside of London and the South-East, in a March 2015 survey. Weymouth and Portland has the highest council tax in England. West Somerset has the lowest average full-time pay at £287; West Somerset is also the district where poor children do much worse than wealthier children at school, with some of the worst differences in the UK, according to Ambition School Leadership.

===Teenage pregnancy===
For top-tier authorities, Torbay has the highest teenage pregnancy rate in the region, with Exeter the highest rate for council districts. For top-tier authorities, North Somerset (closely followed by Bath &amp; NE Somerset) has the lowest rate, with Cotswold having the lowest rate for council districts.

===Health===
The population in the region with the highest obesity level is Sedgemoor in Somerset, with 73.4%, the fifth in the UK. North Dorset has the lowest proportion of cancer deaths in England – 97 per 100,000 (the England average is 142 per 100,000), down from 162 ten years earlier.

In the 2011 census, East Dorset had the highest rate of marriage in the UK; East Dorset also has the third-highest life expectancy for men in the UK at 82.7.

===Crime===
For England and Wales in 2015, Wiltshire has the fourth-lowest crime rate, and Devon and Cornwall has the fifth-lowest.

===Deprivation===
As measured by the English Indices of Deprivation 2007, the region shows similarities with Southern England in having more Lower Layer Super Output Areas in the 20% least multiple deprived districts than the 20% most deprived. The relative amount of deprivation is similar to the East Midlands, except the South West has many fewer deprived areas. According to the LSOA data in 2007, the most deprived districts (before Cornwall became a unitary authority) were, in descending order: Bristol (64th in England), Torbay (71st), Plymouth (77th), Kerrier (86th), Restormel (89th), North Cornwall (96th), and West Somerset (106th). At county level, the deprived areas are City of Bristol (49th in England), Torbay (55th), Plymouth (58th), and Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly (69th).

The least deprived council districts are, in descending order: East Dorset, North Wiltshire, South Gloucestershire, Cotswold, Kennet, Stroud, Tewkesbury, West Wiltshire, Salisbury, and Bath and North East Somerset. At county level, the least deprived areas, in descending order, are South Gloucestershire, Wiltshire, Bath and North East Somerset, Dorset, Gloucestershire, Poole, North Somerset, and Somerset. For smaller areas, the least-deprived in the region are E01015563 (139th in England) – Shaw and Nine Elms ward, in north Swindon; E01014791 (163rd in England) – Portishead East ward, in North Somerset off the A369 in Portishead and North Weston; E01020377 (184th in England) – Colehill East ward, in East Dorset, east of Wimborne Minster.

In March 2011, the region had the second-lowest unemployment claimant count in England, second to South East England, with 2.7%. Inside the region, Torbay has the highest rate with 4.5%, followed by Bristol and Plymouth with 3.8%. East Dorset has the lowest rate with 1.4%.

==Language==

The Cornish language evolved from the Southwestern dialect of the Brittonic language spoken during the Iron Age and Roman period. The area controlled by the Britons was progressively reduced by the expansion of Wessex after the 6th century, and in 936 Athelstan set the east bank of the Tamar as the boundary between Anglo-Saxon Wessex and Celtic Cornwall. The Cornish language continued to flourish during the Middle Ages but declined thereafter, and the last speaker of traditional Cornish died in the 19th century. Geographical names derived from the British language are widespread in South West England, and include several examples of the River Avon, from &quot;abonā&quot; = &quot;river&quot; (cf. Welsh &quot;afon&quot;), and the words &quot;tor&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

Until the 19th century, the West Country and its dialects of the English language were largely protected from outside influences, due to its relative geographical isolation. The West Country dialects derive not from a corrupted form of modern English, but from the Southwestern dialects of Middle English, which themselves derived from the dialects of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Wessex. Late West Saxon, which formed the earliest English language standard, from the time of King Alfred until the late 11th century, is the form in which the majority of Anglo-Saxon texts are preserved. Thomas Spencer Baynes claimed in 1856 that, due to its position at the heart of the Kingdom of Wessex, the relics of Anglo-Saxon accent, idiom and vocabulary were best preserved in the Somerset dialect. There is some influence from the Welsh and Cornish languages, depending on the specific location.

West Country dialects are commonly represented as &quot;Mummerset&quot;, a kind of catchall southern rural accent invented for broadcasting.

==Economy and industry==
The most economically productive areas within the region are Bristol, the M4 corridor and south east Dorset, which are the areas with the best links to London. Bristol alone accounts for a quarter of the region&#x27;s economy, with the surrounding areas of Gloucestershire, Somerset and Wiltshire accounting for a further quarter.

Bristol&#x27;s economy has been built on maritime trade, including the import of tobacco and the slave trade. Since the early 20th century, however, aeronautics have taken over as the basis of Bristol&#x27;s economy, with companies including Airbus UK, Rolls-Royce (military division) and BAE Systems (former Bristol Aeroplane Company then BAC) manufacturing in Filton. Defence Equipment &amp; Support is at MoD Abbey Wood. More recently defence, telecommunications, information technology and electronics have been important industries in Bristol, Swindon and elsewhere. The Driver &amp; Vehicle Standards Agency, the Soil Association, Clerical Medical, and Bristol Water are in Bristol; Indesit makes tumble dryers in Yate; HP and Infineon Technologies UK are at Stoke Gifford. Knorr-Bremse UK make air brakes in Emersons Green. The South West Observatory&#x27;s Economy Module provides a detailed analysis of the region&#x27;s economy.

The region&#x27;s Gross value added (GVA) breaks down as 69.9% service industry, 28.1% production industry and 2.0% agriculture. This is a slightly higher proportion in production, and lower proportion in services, than the UK average. Agriculture, though in decline, is important in many parts of the region. Dairy farming is especially important in Dorset and Devon, and the region has 1.76 million cattle, second to only one other UK region, and of grassland, more than any other region. Only 5.6% of the region&#x27;s agriculture is arable.

Tourism is important in the region, and in 2003 the tourist sector contributed £4,928 million to the region&#x27;s economy.
In 2001 the GVA of the hotel industry was £2,200 million, and the region had 13,800 hotels with 250,000 bed spaces.

There are large differences in prosperity between the eastern parts of the region and the west. While Bristol is the second most affluent large city in England after London, parts of Cornwall have among the lowest average incomes in Northern Europe.
The region&#x27;s Manufacturing Advisory Service is on the A38 north of Gloucester at Twigworth, and the UK Trade &amp; Investment office is at the Leigh Court Business Centre in Abbots Leigh, North Somerset.

Cornwall has become reliant on tourism, more so than the other counties of the South West. In 2010 Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly had the lowest GVA per head of any county or unitary authority in England. It contributes only 7.4% of the region&#x27;s economy and has received EU Convergence funding (formerly Objective One funding) since 2000. Over four million people visit the county each year. The reasons for Cornwall&#x27;s poor economic performance are complex and apparently persistent, but causes include its remoteness and poor transport links, the decline of its traditional industries, such as mining, agriculture and fishing, the low-wealth generating capacity of tourism, relocation of higher skilled jobs to other parts of the South West, and lack of a concerted economic strategy (although use of European Regional Development Fund and European Social Fund monies have been deployed in an attempt at restructuring).

==Subdivisions==
The region covers much of the historical area of Wessex (omitting only Hampshire and Berkshire), and all of the Celtic Kingdom of Dumnonia which comprised Cornwall, Devon, and parts of Somerset and Dorset. In terms of local government, it was divided after 1974 into Avon, Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, Gloucestershire, Somerset, and Wiltshire. Avon has since been abolished, and several mainly urban areas have become unitary authorities.
===Local government===
The official region consists of the following geographic counties and local government areas:

* UA = unitary authority area (non-metropolitan county and district)
* CC = county council

===Eurostat NUTS===
In the Eurostat Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS), South West England is a level-1 NUTS region, coded &quot;UKK&quot;, which is subdivided as follows:

==South West Regional Assembly==

Although referendums had been planned on whether elected assemblies should be set up in some of the regions, none was planned in the South West. The South West Regional Assembly (SWRA) was the regional assembly for the South West region, established in 1999. It was based in Exeter and Taunton. The SWRA was a partnership of councillors from all local authorities in the region and representatives of various sectors with a role in the region&#x27;s economic, social and environmental well-being. There was much opposition to the formation of the SWRA with critics saying it was an unelected unrepresentative and unaccountable &quot;quango&quot;. The Regional Assembly was wound up in May 2009, and its functions taken on by the Strategic Leaders&#x27; Board (SLB) of South West Councils.

==Politics==
As of the 2024 United Kingdom general election, The South West contains 58 seats in the House of Commons. Labour hold 24 seats, The Liberal Democrats hold 22 seats, The Conservatives hold 11 seats and The Greens hold 1 seat.

==Education==

===Schools===
===Secondary education===

In 2012, South Hams had the highest percentage of pupils achieving 5 or more GCSEs at grade A*-C at 86%, whilst Purbeck had the lowest at 70%.

The region has an above average rate of attainment in A-Level (and equivalent) examinations, having outperformed the West Midlands, East Midlands, North East and London in 2012.

There are also four higher education colleges. The region has the lowest number of people registered on higher education courses at FE colleges.

The University of Bristol receives the most total funding, according to Higher Education Funding Council for England figures for the 2006/2007 academic year, and the largest research grant—twice as big as any other in the region. Bath has the next largest research grant, closely followed by Exeter. UWE and Plymouth get small research grants, but no other universities in the region receive much of a research grant. The University of Plymouth has the largest teaching grant.

Once graduated, around 50% stay in the region, with 15% each going to London or the South East (around 80% find work in the south of England).

<doc id="52946" wikidata="Q170373" url="?curid=52946" title="Christopher Wren">
<text>Sir Christopher Wren (; – ) was an English architect, astronomer, mathematician and physicist who was one of the most highly acclaimed architects in the history of England. Known for his work in the English Baroque style, he was accorded responsibility for rebuilding 52 churches in the City of London after the Great Fire in 1666, including what is regarded as his masterpiece, St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, on Ludgate Hill, completed in 1710.

The principal creative responsibility for a number of the churches is now more commonly attributed to others in his office, especially Nicholas Hawksmoor. Other notable buildings by Wren include the Royal Hospital Chelsea, the Old Royal Naval College, Greenwich, and the south front of Hampton Court Palace.

Educated in Latin and Aristotelian physics at the University of Oxford, Wren was a founder of the Royal Society and served as its president from 1680 to 1682. His scientific work was highly regarded by Isaac Newton and Blaise Pascal.

== Life and works ==
Wren was born in East Knoyle in Wiltshire, the only surviving son of Christopher Wren the Elder and Mary Cox, the only child of the Wiltshire squire Robert Cox from Fonthill Bishop. Christopher Sr. was, at that time, the rector of East Knoyle and, later, Dean of Windsor. It was while they were living at East Knoyle that all their children were born; Mary, Catherine and Susan were all born by 1628, but then several children who were born died within a few weeks of their birth. Christopher was born in 1632. Then, two years later, another daughter named Elizabeth was born. Mary must have died shortly after the birth of Elizabeth, although there does not appear to be any surviving record of the date. Through Mary Cox, however, the family became well off financially for, as the only heir, she had inherited her father&#x27;s estate.

As a child Wren &quot;seem&#x27;d consumptive&quot;. Although a sickly child, he would survive into robust old age. He was first taught at home by a private tutor and his father. After his father&#x27;s royal appointment as Dean of Windsor in March 1635, his family spent part of each year there, but little is known about Wren&#x27;s life at Windsor. He spent his first eight years at East Knoyle and was educated by the Rev. William Shepherd, a local clergyman.

Little is known of Wren&#x27;s schooling thereafter, during dangerous times when his father&#x27;s Royal associations would have required the family to keep a very low profile from the ruling Parliamentary authorities. It was a tough time in his life, but one which would go on to have a significant impact upon his later works. The story that he was at Westminster School between 1641 and 1646 is substantiated only by &quot;Parentalia&quot;, the biography compiled by his son, a fourth Christopher, which places him there &quot;for some short time&quot; before going up to Oxford (in 1650); however, it is entirely consistent with headmaster Doctor Busby&#x27;s well-documented practice of educating the sons of impoverished Royalists and Puritans alike, irrespective of current politics or his own position.
Some of Wren&#x27;s youthful exercises preserved or recorded (though few are datable) showed that he received a thorough grounding in Latin and also learned to draw. According to &quot;Parentalia&quot;, he was &quot;initiated&quot; in the principles of mathematics by William Holder, who married Wren&#x27;s elder sister Susan (or Susanna) in 1643. His drawing was put to academic use in providing many of the anatomical drawings for the anatomy textbook of the brain, &quot;Cerebri Anatome&quot; (1664), published by Thomas Willis, who coined the term &quot;neurology&quot;. During this time period, Wren became interested in the design and construction of mechanical instruments. It was probably through Holder that Wren met Sir Charles Scarburgh whom Wren assisted in his anatomical studies.
Another sister Anne Brunsell, married a clergyman and is buried in Stretham.

On 25 June 1650, Wren entered Wadham College, Oxford, where he studied Latin and the works of Aristotle. It is anachronistic to imagine that he received scientific training in the modern sense. However, Wren became closely associated with John Wilkins, the Warden of Wadham. The Wilkins circle was a group whose activities led to the formation of the Royal Society, comprising a number of distinguished mathematicians, creative workers and experimental philosophers. This connection probably influenced Wren&#x27;s studies of science and mathematics at Oxford. He graduated B.A. in 1651, and two years later received M.A.

===1653–1664===

After receiving his M.A. in 1653, Wren was elected a fellow of All Souls&#x27; College in the same year and began an active period of research and experiment in Oxford. Among these were a number of physiological experiments on dogs, including one now recognized as the first injection of fluids into the bloodstream of a live animal under laboratory conditions. At Oxford he became part of the group around John Wilkins, he was key to the correspondence network known as the Invisible College, Within the arms of All Souls, the arms of Wren&#x27;s friend Robert Boyle appear in the colonnade of the Great Quadrangle, opposite the arms of the Hill family of Shropshire, close by a sundial designed by Boyle&#x27;s friend Wren.

His days as a fellow of All Souls ended when Wren was appointed Professor of Astronomy at Gresham College, London, in 1657. He was there provided with a set of rooms and a stipend and required to give weekly lectures in both Latin and English. Wren took up this new work with enthusiasm. He continued to meet the men with whom he had frequent discussions in Oxford. They attended his London lectures and in 1660, initiated formal weekly meetings. It was from these meetings that the Royal Society, England&#x27;s premier scientific body, was to develop. He undoubtedly played a major role in the early life of what would become the Royal Society; his great breadth of expertise in so many different subjects helped in the exchange of ideas between the various scientists. In fact, the report on one of these meetings reads:

In 1662, they proposed a society &quot;for the promotion of Physico-Mathematicall Experimental Learning&quot;. This body received its Royal Charter from Charles II and &quot;The Royal Society of London for Improving Natural Knowledge&quot; was formed. In addition to being a founder member of the Society, Wren was president of the Royal Society from 1680 to 1682.

In 1661, Wren was elected Savilian Professor of Astronomy at Oxford, and in 1669 he was appointed Surveyor of Works to Charles II. From 1661 until 1668 Wren&#x27;s life was based in Oxford, although his attendance at meetings of the Royal Society meant that he had to make periodic trips to London.

The main sources for Wren&#x27;s scientific achievements are the records of the Royal Society. His scientific works ranged from astronomy, optics, the problem of finding longitude at sea, cosmology, mechanics, microscopy, surveying, medicine and meteorology. He observed, measured, dissected, built models and employed, invented and improved a variety of instruments.

===1665–1723===
It was probably around this time that Christopher Wren was drawn into redesigning a battered St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. Making a trip to Paris in 1665, Wren studied architecture, which had reached a climax of creativity, and perused the drawings of Bernini, the great Italian sculptor and architect, who himself was visiting Paris at the time. Returning from Paris, he made his first design for St Paul&#x27;s. A week later, however, the Great Fire destroyed two-thirds of the city. Wren submitted his plans for rebuilding the city to King Charles II, although they were never adopted. With his appointment as King&#x27;s Surveyor of Works in 1669, he had a presence in the general process of rebuilding the city, but was not directly involved with the rebuilding of houses or companies&#x27; halls. Wren was personally responsible for the rebuilding of 51 churches; however, it is not necessarily true to say that each of them represented his own fully developed design.

Wren was knighted on 14 November 1673. This honour was bestowed on him after his resignation from the Savilian chair in Oxford, by which time he had already begun to make his mark as an architect, both in services to the Crown and in playing an important part in rebuilding London after the Great Fire.

Additionally, he was sufficiently active in public affairs to be returned as Member of Parliament on four occasions. Wren first stood for Parliament in a by-election in 1667 for the Cambridge University constituency, losing by six votes to Sir Charles Wheler. He was unsuccessful again in a by-election for the Oxford University constituency in 1674, losing to Thomas Thynne. At his third attempt Wren was successful, and he sat for Plympton Erle during the Loyal Parliament of 1685 to 1687. Wren was returned for New Windsor on 11 January 1689 in the general election, but his election was declared void on 14 May 1689. He was elected again for New Windsor on 6 March 1690, but this election was declared void on 17 May 1690. Over a decade later he was elected unopposed for Weymouth and Melcombe Regis at the November 1701 general election. He retired at the general election the following year.

== Marriage to Faith Coghill Wren ==
Wren&#x27;s career was well established by 1669, and it may have been his appointment as Surveyor of the King&#x27;s Works early that year that persuaded him that he could finally afford to marry. In 1669, the 37-year-old Wren married his childhood neighbour, the 33-year-old Faith Coghill, daughter of Sir John Coghill of Bletchingdon. Little is known of Faith, but a love letter from Wren survives, which reads, in part:

This brief marriage produced two children: Gilbert, born October 1672, who suffered from convulsions and died at about 18 months old, and Christopher, born February 1675. The younger Christopher was trained by his father to be an architect. It was this Christopher that supervised the topping out ceremony of St Paul&#x27;s in 1710 and wrote the famous &quot;Parentalia, or, Memoirs of the family of the Wrens&quot;. Faith Wren died of smallpox on 3 September 1675. She was buried in the chancel of St Martin-in-the-Fields beside the infant Gilbert. A few days later Wren&#x27;s mother-in-law, Lady Coghill, arrived to take the infant Christopher back with her to Oxfordshire to raise.

== Marriage to Jane Fitzwilliam ==

In 1677, 17 months after the death of his first wife, Wren remarried, this time to Jane Fitzwilliam, daughter of William FitzWilliam, 2nd Baron FitzWilliam, and his wife Jane Perry, the daughter of a prosperous London merchant.

She was a mystery to Wren&#x27;s friends and companions. Robert Hooke, who often saw Wren two or three times every week, had, as he recorded in his diary, never even heard of her, and was not to meet her till six weeks after the marriage. As with the first marriage, this too produced two children: a daughter Jane (1677–1702); and a son William, &quot;Poor Billy&quot; born June 1679, who was reportedly handicapped in some way and it is also known that he never married.

Like the first, this second marriage was also brief. Jane Wren is believed to have died of tuberculosis in September 1680 although this cannot be confirmed. She was buried alongside Faith and Gilbert in the chancel of St Martin-in-the-Fields. Wren was never to marry again; he lived to be over 90 years old and of those years was married only twice.

Bletchingdon was the home of Wren&#x27;s brother-in-law William Holder, who was rector of the local church. Holder had been a Fellow of Pembroke College, Oxford. An intellectual of considerable ability, he is said to have been the figure who introduced Wren to arithmetic and geometry.

Wren&#x27;s later life was not without criticisms and attacks on his competence and his taste. In 1712, the &quot;Letter Concerning Design&quot; of Anthony Ashley Cooper, third Earl of Shaftesbury, circulated in manuscript. Proposing a new British style of architecture, Shaftesbury censured Wren&#x27;s cathedral, his taste and his long-standing control of royal works. Although Wren was appointed to the Fifty New Churches Commission in 1711, he was left only with nominal charge of a board of works when the surveyorship started in 1715. On 26 April 1718, on the pretext of failing powers, he was dismissed in favour of William Benson.

In 1713, he bought the manor of Wroxall, Warwickshire, from the Burgoyne family, to which his son Christopher retired in 1716 after losing his post as Clerk of Works. Several of Wren&#x27;s descendants would be buried there in the Church of St Leonard.

===Death===

The Wren family estate was at The Old Court House in the area of Hampton Court. He had been given a lease on the property by Queen Anne in lieu of salary arrears for building St Paul&#x27;s. For convenience Wren also leased a house on St James&#x27;s Street in London. According to a 19th-century legend, he would often go to London to pay unofficial visits to St Paul&#x27;s, to check on the progress of &quot;my greatest work&quot;. On one of these trips to London, at the age of ninety, he caught a cold and on 25 February 1723 a servant who tried to awaken Wren from his nap found that he had died in his sleep.

Wren was laid to rest on 5 March 1723. His body was placed in the southeast corner of the crypt of St Paul&#x27;s. There is a memorial to him in the crypt at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. beside those of his daughter Jane, his sister Susan Holder, and her husband William. The plain stone plaque was written by Wren&#x27;s eldest son and heir, Christopher Wren the Younger The inscription, which is also inscribed in a circle of black marble on the main floor beneath the centre of the dome, reads:

which translates from Latin as:
His obituary was published in the &quot;Post Boy&quot; No. 5244 London 2 March 1723:

&quot;The Curious and Entire Libraries of Sir Christopher Wren&quot;, and of his son, were auctioned by Langford and Cock at Mr Cock&#x27;s in Covent Garden on 24–27 October 1748.

==Scientific career==

One of Wren&#x27;s friends, Robert Hooke, scientist and architect and a fellow Westminster Schoolboy, said of him &quot;Since the time of Archimedes there scarce ever met in one man in so great perfection such a mechanical hand and so philosophical mind.&quot;

When a fellow of All Souls, Wren constructed a transparent beehive for scientific observation; he began observing the Moon, which was to lead to the invention of micrometers for the telescope. According to Parentalia (pp. 210–211), his solid model of the Moon attracted the attention of the King who commanded Wren to perfect it and present it to him. 
He experimented on terrestrial magnetism and had taken part in medical experiments while at Wadham College, performing the first successful injection of a substance into the bloodstream (of a dog). In Gresham College, he did experiments involving determining longitude through magnetic variation and through lunar observation to help with navigation, and helped construct a telescope with Sir Paul Neile. Wren also studied and improved the microscope and telescope at this time. He had also been making observations of the planet Saturn from around 1652 with the aim of explaining its appearance. His hypothesis was written up in &quot;De corpore saturni&quot; but before the work was published, Huygens presented his theory of the rings of Saturn. Immediately Wren recognised this as a better hypothesis than his own and &quot;De corpore saturni&quot; was never published. In addition, he constructed an exquisitely detailed lunar model and presented it to the king. In 1658, he found the length of an arc of the cycloid using an exhaustion proof based on dissections to reduce the problem to summing segments of chords of a circle which are in geometric progression.

A year into Wren&#x27;s appointment as a Savilian Professor in Oxford, the Royal Society was created and Wren became an active member. As Savilian Professor, Wren studied mechanics thoroughly, especially elastic collisions and pendulum motions. He also directed his far-ranging intelligence to the study of meteorology: in 1662, he invented the tipping bucket rain gauge and, in 1663, designed a &quot;weather-clock&quot; that would record temperature, humidity, rainfall and barometric pressure. A working weather clock based on Wren&#x27;s design was completed by Robert Hooke in 1679.

In addition, Wren experimented on muscle functionality, hypothesizing that the swelling and shrinking of muscles might proceed from a fermentative motion arising from the mixture of two heterogeneous fluids. Although this is incorrect, it was at least founded upon observation and may mark a new outlook on medicine: specialisation.

Another topic to which Wren contributed was optics. He published a description of an engine to create perspective drawings and he discussed the grinding of conical lenses and mirrors. Out of this work came another of Wren&#x27;s important mathematical results, namely that the hyperboloid of revolution is a ruled surface. These results were published in 1669. In subsequent years, Wren continued with his work with the Royal Society, although after the 1680s his scientific interests seem to have waned: no doubt his architectural and official duties absorbed more time.

It was a problem posed by Wren that serves as an ultimate source to the conception of Newton&#x27;s &quot;Principia Mathematica Philosophiae Naturalis&quot;. Robert Hooke had theorised that planets, moving in vacuo, describe orbits around the Sun because of a rectilinear inertial motion by the tangent and an accelerated motion towards the Sun. Wren&#x27;s challenge to Halley and Hooke, for the reward of a book worth thirty shillings, was to provide, within the context of Hooke&#x27;s hypothesis, a mathematical theory linking Kepler&#x27;s laws with a specific force law. Halley took the problem to Newton for advice, prompting the latter to write a nine-page answer, &quot;De motu corporum in gyrum&quot;, which was later to be expanded into the &quot;Principia&quot;.

Mentioned above are only a few of Wren&#x27;s scientific works. He also studied other areas, ranging from agriculture, ballistics, water and freezing, light and refraction, to name only a few. Thomas Birch&#x27;s &quot;History of the Royal Society&quot; (1756–57) is one of the most important sources of our knowledge not only of the origins of the Society, but also the day-to-day running of the Society. It is in these records that most of Wren&#x27;s known scientific works are recorded.

==Architectural career==

Wren was a prominent man of science at the height of the Scientific Revolution. The Scientific Revolution seemed to promise a merger of the science of mechanics and the art of building. In Galileo Galilei&#x27;s &quot;Two New Sciences&quot; the first science is not dynamics, for which the book is now better known, but rather the strength of materials, which Galileo had recognized 30 years earlier as a &quot;science that is very necessary in making machines and buildings of all kinds.&quot; In 1624 Henry Wotton, the British ambassador to Venice, published a book on architecture in which he analyzed in a rudimentary way the structure of a stone arch. Moreover, in the 17th century, it was people who would now be called scientists who were awarded the commissions to design and build monumental structures. In Turin, Guarino Guarini, a mathematician, devised the plans for such celebrated buildings as the Royal Church of Saint Lawrence, the Chapel of the Holy Shroud and the Palazzo Carignano. In Paris, Claude Perrault, a physician and an anatomist, designed the façade of the Louvre and the observatory of the Académie Française. In London, it was Wren and Hooke who collaborated as chief architect and city surveyor after the city was devastated by the Great Fire of 1666.

In 1661, just months after taking his post at Oxford, Wren was invited by Charles II to oversee the construction of new harbour defences at Tangier—then-newly under British control. Wren ultimately excused himself from the King&#x27;s offer. Letters dated to the end of 1661 note that in addition to the Tangier project, Charles II had also sought Wren for consultation regarding repairs to Old St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, the reconstruction of which would ultimately be the architect&#x27;s magnum opus. Speaking of Wren&#x27;s vocational transition from academic to architect-engineer, biographer Adrian Tinniswood writes &quot;the use of mathematicians in military fortification was not unusual... Perhaps Wren also had experience of the business of fortification, more than we know.&quot;

=== Early architectural work ===
Wren&#x27;s first known foray into architecture came after his uncle, Matthew Wren, Bishop of Ely, offered to finance a new chapel for Pembroke College, Cambridge. Matthew commissioned his nephew for the design, finding the architecturally inexperienced Christopher to be both ideologically sympathetic and stylistically deferential. Wren produced his design in the Winter of 1662 or 1663 and the chapel was completed in 1665.

Wren&#x27;s second, similarly collegiate work followed soon after, when he was commissioned to design Oxford&#x27;s &quot;New Theatre&quot;, financed by Gilbert Sheldon. His design for the structure was met with lukewarm to negative reception, with even Wren&#x27;s defenders admitting the young architect to have not yet been &quot;capable of handling a large architectural composition with assurance&quot;. Adrian Tinniswood credits the building&#x27;s flaws to &quot;Sheldon&#x27;s refusal to pay for an elaborate exterior, Wren&#x27;s inability to find an adequate external expression for a building which was wholly conditioned by the functionality of its interior space and, ...his refusal to bend the knee to classical authority in the way that our experience of eighteenth-century architecture has conditioned us to believe is right.&quot; Prior to the theatre&#x27;s 1669 completion, Wren had received further commissions for the Garden Quadrangle at Trinity College, Oxford, and the chapel of Emmanuel College, Cambridge.

Wren left for Paris in July 1665 on his first and only trip abroad. In France, the architect encountered an architectural milieu more closely linked to the ideals of the Italian Renaissance. Wren also met Gian Lorenzo Bernini, who was &quot;widely acknowledged by contemporaries as the greatest artist of the century&quot;. Though Bernini&#x27;s concrete influence on Wren&#x27;s designs was transmitted via published plans and engravings, the encounter surely impacted the budding architect and his vocational trajectory.

===St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral===
St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in London has always been the highlight of Wren&#x27;s reputation. His association with it spans his whole architectural career, including the 36 years between the start of the new building and the declaration by parliament of its completion in 1711.Letters document Wren&#x27;s involvement in St Paul as early as 1661, when he was consulted by Charles II regarding repairs to the medieval structure. In the spring of 1666, he made his first design for a dome for St Paul&#x27;s. It was accepted in principle on 27 August 1666. One week later, however, the Great Fire of London reduced two-thirds of the City to a smoking desert and old St Paul&#x27;s to ruin. Wren was most likely at Oxford at the time, but the news, so fantastically relevant to his future, drew him at once to London. Between 5 and 11 September, he ascertained the precise area of devastation, worked out a plan for rebuilding the City and submitted it to Charles II. Others also submitted plans. However, no new plan proceeded any further than the paper on which it was drawn. A Rebuilding of London Act which provided rebuilding of some essential buildings was passed in 1666. In 1669, the King&#x27;s Surveyor of Works died and Wren was promptly installed.

It was not until 1670 that the pace of rebuilding started accelerating. A second rebuilding act was passed that year, raising the tax on coal and thus providing a source of funds for rebuilding of churches destroyed within the City of London. Wren presented his initial &quot;First Model&quot; for St Paul&#x27;s. This plan was accepted, and demolition of the old cathedral began. By 1672, however, this design seemed too modest, and Wren met his critics by producing a design of spectacular grandeur. This modified design, called &quot;Great Model&quot;, was accepted by the King and the construction started in November 1673. However, this design failed to satisfy the chapter and clerical opinion generally; moreover, it had an economic drawback. Wren was confined to a &quot;cathedral form&quot; desired by the clergy. In 1674 he produced the rather meagre Classical-Gothic compromise known as the Warrant Design. However, this design, called so from the royal warrant of 14 May 1675 attached to the drawings, is not the design upon which work had begun a few weeks before.

The cathedral that Wren started to build bears only a slight resemblance to the Warrant Design. In 1697, the first service was held in the cathedral when Wren was 65. There was still, however, no dome. Finally, in 1711 the cathedral was declared complete, and Wren was paid the half of his salary that, in the hope of accelerating progress, Parliament had withheld for 14 years since 1697. The cathedral had been built for 36 years under his direction, and the only disappointment he had about his masterpiece was the dome: against his wishes, the commission engaged Thornhill to paint the inner dome in false perspective and finally authorised a balustrade around the roof line. This diluted the hard edge Wren had intended for his cathedral, and elicited the apt parthian comment that &quot;ladies think nothing well without an edging&quot;.

===Later career===
During the 1670s, Christopher Wren received significant secular commissions. Among many of his notable designs at this time, the monument (1671–76) commemorating the Great Fire also involved Robert Hooke, but Wren was in control of the final design, the Royal Observatory (1675–76), and the Wren Library at Trinity College, Cambridge (1676–84) were the most important ones.

In 1682, Wren advised that the original statues of the King&#x27;s Beasts on St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor be removed. The pinnacles were left bare until 1925, when replica statues were installed.

By historical accident, all Wren&#x27;s large-scale secular commissions dated from after the 1680s. At the age of 50 his personal development, as was that of English architecture, was ready for monumental but humane architecture, in which the scales of individual parts relate both to the whole and to the people who used them. The first large project Wren designed, the Chelsea Hospital (1682–92), does not entirely satisfy the eye in this respect, but met its brief with distinction and such success that even in the 21st century it fulfils its original function. The reconstruction of the stateroom at Windsor Castle was notable for the integration of architecture, sculpture and painting. This commission was in the hand of Hugh May, who died in February 1684, before the construction finished; Wren assumed his post and finalised the works.

Between 1683 and 1685 he was much occupied in designing the King&#x27;s House, Winchester, where Charles II had hoped to spend his declining years, but which was never completed. When Wren promised that it would be complete within a year the King, who was conscious of his mortality, replied that &quot; a year is a great time in my life&quot;.After the death of Charles II in 1685, Wren&#x27;s attention was directed mainly to Whitehall (1685–87). The new king, James II, required a new chapel and also ordered a new gallery, council chamber and a riverside apartment for the Queen. Later, when James II was removed from the throne, Wren took on architectural projects such as Kensington Palace (1689–96) and Hampton Court (1689–1700).

The erection of the present Windsor Guildhall was begun in 1687, under the direction of Sir Thomas Fitz (or Fiddes) but there is a story that on his death in 1689, the task was taken over by Wren. It was completed at a cost of £2687 – 1s – 6d. The new building was supported around its perimeter by stone columns, providing a covered area beneath as a venue for corn markets.

The story is widely told that the borough Council demanded that Wren should insert additional columns within the covered area, in order to support the weight of the heavy building above; Wren, however, was adamant that these were not necessary. Eventually, the council insisted and, in due course, the extra supporting columns were built, but Wren made them slightly short, so that they do not quite touch the ceiling, hence proving his claim that they were not necessary. However, there is little evidence that Wren was ever involved in the design or construction of the Guildhall. It is now believed that the story grew out of Wren&#x27;s connections with Windsor and that his son, also called Christopher Wren, who served as a Member of Parliament for Windsor, commissioned the statue of Prince George of Denmark in 1713 on the south end of the building and his name was engraved underneath. The pillars were probably moved into the corn market from the east side of the building when an extension was added in 1829. The gaps at the top of the pillars are now filled with tiles smaller than the capitals.

Wren did not pursue his work on architectural design as actively as he had before the 1690s, although he still played important roles in a number of royal commissions. In 1696 he was appointed Surveyor of Greenwich Naval Hospital, and in 1698 he was appointed Surveyor of Westminster Abbey. He resigned from the former role in 1716 but held the latter until his death, approving with a wavering signature Burlington&#x27;s revisions of Wren&#x27;s own earlier designs for the great Archway of Westminster School.

==Freemasonry==
Since at least the 18th century, the Lodge of Antiquity No. 2, one of the four founding Masonic Lodges of the Premier Grand Lodge of England in 1717, has claimed Christopher Wren to have been its Master at the &quot;Goose and Gridiron&quot; at St. Paul&#x27;s churchyard. Whilst he was rebuilding the cathedral he is said to have been &quot;adopted&quot; on 18 May 1691 (that is, accepted as a sort of honorary member or patron, rather than an operative). Their 18th-century maul with its 1827 inscription claiming that it was used by Wren for the foundation stone of St. Paul&#x27;s, belonging to the Lodge and on display in the Library and Museum of Freemasonry in London, corroborates the story. James Anderson made the claims in his widely circulated &quot;Constitutions&quot; while many of Wren&#x27;s friends were still alive, but he made many highly creative claims as to the history or legends of Freemasonry. There is also a clear possibility of confusion between the operative workmen&#x27;s lodges which might naturally have welcomed the boss, and the &quot;speculative&quot; or gentlemen&#x27;s lodges which became highly fashionable just after Wren&#x27;s death. By the standards of his time, a gentleman like Wren would not generally join an artisan body; however the workmen of St Paul&#x27;s cathedral would naturally have sought the patronage or &quot;interest&quot; of their employer, and within Wren&#x27;s lifetime there was a predominantly gentlemen&#x27;s Lodge at the &quot;Rummer and Grapes&quot;, a mile upriver at Westminster (where Wren had been to School).

In 1788, the Lodge of Antiquity thought they were buying a portrait of Wren which now dominates Lodge Room 10, in the same building as the Museum; but it is now identified with William Talman, not Wren. Nevertheless, this recorded event and many old records attest to the fact that Antiquity thought that Wren had been its Master, at a time when it still held its minute books for the relevant years (which were lost by Preston at some date after 1778).

The evidence of whether Wren was a speculative freemason is the subject of the Prestonian Lecture of 2011, which concludes on the evidence of two obituaries and Aubrey&#x27;s memoirs, with supporting materials, that he did indeed attend the closed meeting in 1691, probably of the Lodge of Antiquity, but that there is nothing to suggest that he was ever a Grand Officer as claimed by Anderson.

==Achievement and legacy==

Christopher Wren appeared on the reverse of the first British £50 banknote (Series D) issued in modern times. The notes were printed between 1981 and 1994, and were in circulation until 1996.

In 1997, UNESCO inscribed Wren&#x27;s Greenwich Hospital on the World Heritage list, citing the complex&#x27;s &quot;outstanding architectural and artistic achievements&quot;.

<text>Hampton Court Palace is a Grade I listed royal palace in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames, southwest and upstream of central London on the River Thames. Opened to the public, the palace is managed by Historic Royal Palaces, a charity set up to preserve several unoccupied royal properties.

The building of the palace began in 1514 for Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, the chief minister of Henry VIII. In 1529, as Wolsey fell from favour, the cardinal gave the palace to the king to try to save his own life, which he knew was now in grave danger due to Henry VIII&#x27;s deepening frustration and anger. The palace went on to become one of Henry&#x27;s most favoured residences; soon after acquiring the property, he arranged for it to be enlarged so it could accommodate his sizeable retinue of courtiers. 

In the early 1690s, William III&#x27;s massive rebuilding and expansion work, which was intended to rival the Palace of Versailles, destroyed much of the Tudor palace. His work ceased in 1694, leaving the palace in two distinct contrasting architectural styles, domestic Tudor and Baroque. While the palace&#x27;s styles are an accident of fate, a unity exists due to the use of pink bricks and a symmetrical, if vague, balancing of successive low wings. George II was the last monarch to reside in the palace.

The palace is open to the public and a major tourist attraction, reached by train from Waterloo station in central London and served by Hampton Court railway station in East Molesey. Buses 111, 216, 411 and R68 stop outside the gates. The structure and grounds are cared for by an independent charity, Historic Royal Palaces, which receives no funding from the Government or the Crown. The palace displays many works of art from the Royal Collection.

Apart from the palace itself and its gardens, other points of interest for visitors include the celebrated maze, the historic royal tennis court (see below), and a huge grape vine, the world&#x27;s largest . The palace&#x27;s Home Park is the site of the annual Hampton Court Palace Festival and Hampton Court Garden Festival.

==History==

=== Medieval ===
What would become Hampton Court Palace was originally a property of the Order of St John of Jerusalem. It was leased first to John Wode in the mid-15th century, and then to the statesman Sir Giles Daubeney in 1494. Daubeney expanded the previous structures, and built the Great Kitchens that still survive today (although much altered). After Daubeney&#x27;s death in 1508, his 14 year-old heir, Henry Daubeney, had to wait until 1514 to inherit his father&#x27;s possessions. A month later, he relinquished his lease, and the Order of St John of Jerusalem re-leased Hampton Court to Thomas Wolsey.

=== Tudor times ===

Thomas Wolsey, Archbishop of York, chief minister to and a favourite of Henry VIII, took over the site of Hampton Court Palace in 1514. Over the following seven years, Wolsey spent lavishly (200,000 crowns) to build the finest palace in England at Hampton Court. Today, little of Wolsey&#x27;s building work remains unchanged. The first courtyard, the Base Court, (&quot;B on plan&quot;), was his creation, as was the second, inner gatehouse (&quot;C&quot;) which leads to the Clock Court (&quot;D&quot;) (Wolsey&#x27;s seal remains visible over the entrance arch of the clock tower) which contained his private rooms (&quot;O on plan&quot;). The Base Court contained forty-four lodgings reserved for guests, while the second court (today, Clock Court) contained the very best rooms the state apartments reserved for the king and his family. Henry VIII stayed in the state apartments as Wolsey&#x27;s guest immediately after their completion in 1525.
In building his palace, Wolsey was attempting to create a Renaissance cardinal&#x27;s palace of a rectilinear symmetrical plan with grand apartments on a raised piano nobile, all rendered with classical detailing. The historian Jonathan Foyle has suggested that it is likely that Wolsey had been inspired by Paolo Cortese&#x27;s &quot;De Cardinalatu&quot;, a manual for cardinals that included advice on palatial architecture, published in 1510. The architectural historian Sir John Summerson asserts that the palace shows &quot;the essence of Wolseythe plain English churchman who nevertheless made his sovereign the arbiter of Europe and who built and furnished Hampton Court to show foreign embassies that Henry VIII&#x27;s chief minister knew how to live as graciously as any cardinal in Rome.&quot; Whatever the concepts were, the architecture is an excellent and rare example of a thirty-year era when English architecture was in a harmonious transition from domestic Tudor, strongly influenced by perpendicular Gothic, to the Italian Renaissance classical style. Perpendicular Gothic owed nothing historically to the Renaissance style, yet harmonised well with it. This blending of styles was realised by a small group of Italian craftsmen working at the English court in the second and third decades of the sixteenth century. They specialised in the adding of Renaissance ornament to otherwise straightforward Tudor buildings. It was one of these, Giovanni da Maiano, who was responsible for the set of eight relief busts of Roman emperors which were set in the Tudor brickwork.
Henry VIII and his courtiers visited Wolsey at Hampton Court in masque costume in January 1527, disguised as shepherds to play mumchance and dance. Wolsey was only to enjoy his palace for a few years. In 1529, knowing that his enemies and the King were engineering his downfall, he passed the palace to the King as a gift. Wolsey died in 1530.

Within six months of coming into ownership, the King began his own rebuilding and expansion. Henry VIII&#x27;s court consisted of over one thousand people. While the King owned over sixty houses and palaces, few of these were large enough to hold the assembled court, and thus one of the first of the King&#x27;s building works (in order to transform Hampton Court to a principal residence) was to build the vast kitchens. These were quadrupled in size in 1529, enabling the King to provide bouche of court (free food and drink) for his entire court. The architecture of King Henry&#x27;s new palace followed the design precedent set by Wolsey: perpendicular Gothic-inspired Tudor with restrained Renaissance ornament. This hybrid architecture was to remain almost unchanged for nearly a century, until Inigo Jones introduced strong classical influences from Italy to the London palaces of the first Stuart kings.

Between 1532 and 1535 Henry added the Great Hall (the last medieval great hall built for the English monarchy) and the Royal Tennis Court. The Great Hall has a carved hammerbeam roof. During Tudor times, this was the most important room of the palace: here, the King would dine in state seated at a table upon a raised dais. The hall took five years to complete; so impatient was the King for completion that the masons were compelled to work throughout the night by candlelight.

The gatehouse to the second, inner court was adorned in 1540 with the Hampton Court astronomical clock, an early example of a pre-Copernican astronomical clock. Still functioning, the clock shows the time of day, the phases of the moon, the month, the quarter of the year, the date, the sun and star sign, and high water at London Bridge. This last item was of great importance to those visiting this Thames-side palace from London, as the preferred method of transport at the time was by barge, and at low water London Bridge created dangerous rapids. This gatehouse is also known today as Anne Boleyn&#x27;s gate, after Henry&#x27;s second wife. Work was still under way on Anne Boleyn&#x27;s apartments above the gate when Boleyn was beheaded.

During the Tudor period, the palace was the scene of many historic events. In 1537, the King&#x27;s much desired male heir, the future Edward VI, was born at the palace, and the child&#x27;s mother, Jane Seymour, died there two weeks later. Four years afterwards, whilst attending Mass in the palace&#x27;s chapel, the King was informed of the adultery of his fifth wife, Catherine Howard. She was then confined to her room for a few days before being sent to Syon House and then on to the Tower of London. Legend claims she briefly escaped her guards and ran through the Haunted Gallery to beg Henry for her life but she was recaptured.

King Henry died in January 1547 and was succeeded by his son Edward VI, and then by both his daughters in turn. It was to Hampton Court that Queen Mary I (Henry&#x27;s elder daughter) retreated with King Philip to spend her honeymoon, after their wedding at Winchester. Mary chose Hampton Court as the place for the birth of her first child, which turned out to be the first of two phantom pregnancies. Mary had initially wanted to give birth at Windsor Castle as it was a more secure location, and she was still fearful of rebellion. But Hampton Court was considerably larger and could accommodate the entire court and more besides. Mary stayed at the palace awaiting the birth of the &quot;child&quot; for over five months, and only left because of the uninhabitable state of the palace due to the court being kept in the one location for so long. Her court departed for the much smaller Oatlands Palace. Mary was succeeded by her half-sister, Elizabeth I, and it was Elizabeth who had the eastern (privy) kitchen built; today, this is the palace&#x27;s public tea room.

===Stuarts and early Hanoverians===

On the death of Elizabeth I in 1603, the Tudor period came to an end. The Queen was succeeded by her first cousin-twice-removed, James I of the House of Stuart.

Two entertainments for the Stuart court were staged in the Great Hall in January 1604, &quot;The Masque of Indian and China Knights&quot; and &quot;The Vision of the Twelve Goddesses&quot;. On 6 January, Scottish courtiers performed a sword dance for Anne of Denmark. Their dance was compared to a Spanish &quot;matachin&quot;. Later in 1604, the palace was the site of King James&#x27; meeting with representatives of the English Puritans, known as the Hampton Court Conference; while an agreement with the Puritans was not reached, the meeting led to James&#x27;s commissioning of the King James Version of the Bible.

King James was succeeded in 1625 by his son, the ill-fated Charles I. Hampton Court was to become both his palace and his prison. It was also the setting for his honeymoon with his fifteen-year-old bride, Henrietta Maria in 1625. Following King Charles&#x27; execution in 1649, the palace became the property of the Commonwealth presided over by Oliver Cromwell. Unlike some other former royal properties, the palace escaped relatively unscathed. While the government auctioned much of the contents, the building was ignored.

After the Restoration, King Charles II and his successor James II visited Hampton Court but largely preferred to reside elsewhere. By current French court standards, Hampton Court now appeared old-fashioned. It was in 1689, shortly after Louis XIV&#x27;s court had moved permanently to Versailles, that the palace&#x27;s antiquated state was addressed. England had joint monarchs, William III and Mary II. Within months of their accession, they embarked on a massive rebuilding project at Hampton Court. The intention was to demolish the Tudor palace a section at a time while replacing it with a huge modern palace in the Baroque style retaining only Henry VIII&#x27;s Great Hall.

The country&#x27;s most eminent architect, Sir Christopher Wren, was called upon to draw the plans, while the master of works was to be William Talman. The plan was for a vast palace constructed around two courtyards at right angles to each other. Wren&#x27;s design for a domed palace bore resemblances to the work of Jules Hardouin-Mansart and Louis Le Vau, both architects employed by Louis XIV at Versailles. It has been suggested, though, that the plans were abandoned because the resemblance to Versailles was too subtle and not strong enough; at this time, it was impossible for any sovereign to visualise a palace that did not emulate Versailles&#x27; repetitive Baroque form. However, the resemblances are there: while the façades are not so long as those of Versailles, they have similar, seemingly unstoppable repetitive rhythms beneath a long flat skyline. The monotony is even repeated as the façade turns the corner from the east to the south fronts. However, Hampton Court, unlike Versailles, is given an extra dimension by the contrast between the pink brick and the pale Portland stone quoins, frames and banding. Further diversion is added by the circular and decorated windows of the second-floor mezzanine. This theme is repeated in the inner Fountain Court, but the rhythm is faster and the windows, unpedimented on the outer façades, are given pointed pediments in the courtyard; this has led the courtyard to be described as &quot;Startling, as of simultaneous exposure to a great many eyes with raised eyebrows.&quot;
During this work, half the Tudor palace was replaced and Henry VIII&#x27;s staterooms and private apartments were both lost; the new wings around the Fountain Court contained new state apartments and private rooms, one set for the King and one for the Queen. Each suite of state rooms was accessed by a state staircase. The royal suites were of completely equal value in order to reflect William and Mary&#x27;s unique status as joint sovereigns. The King&#x27;s Apartments face south over the Privy Garden, the Queen&#x27;s east over the Fountain Garden. The suites are linked by a gallery running the length of the east façade, another reference to Versailles, where the King and Queen&#x27;s apartments are linked by the Hall of Mirrors. However, at Hampton Court, the linking gallery is of more modest proportions and decoration. The King&#x27;s staircase was decorated with frescos by Antonio Verrio and delicate ironwork by Jean Tijou. Other artists commissioned to decorate the rooms included Grinling Gibbons, Sir James Thornhill and Jacques Rousseau; furnishings were designed by Daniel Marot.

After the death of Queen Mary, King William lost interest in the renovations, and work ceased. However, it was in Hampton Court Park in 1702 that he fell from his horse, later dying from his injuries at Kensington Palace. He was succeeded by his sister-in-law Queen Anne who continued the decoration and completion of the state apartments. On Queen Anne&#x27;s death in 1714 the House of Stuart&#x27;s rule came to an end.

Queen Anne&#x27;s successor was George I; he and his son George II were the last monarchs to reside at Hampton Court. Under George I six rooms were completed in 1717 to the design of John Vanbrugh. Under George II and his wife, Caroline of Ansbach, further refurbishment took place, with the architect William Kent employed to design new furnishings and décor including the Queen&#x27;s Staircase, (1733) and the Cumberland Suite (1737) for the Duke of Cumberland. Today, the Queen&#x27;s Private Apartments are open to the public.

===Later use===
Since the reign of King George II, no monarch has resided at Hampton Court. In fact, George III, from the moment of his accession, never set foot in the palace: he associated the state apartments with a humiliating scene when his grandfather had once struck him following an innocent remark. He did however have the Great Vine planted here in 1763 and had the top two storeys of the Great Gatehouse removed in 1773.

From the 1760s, the palace was used to house grace and favour residents. Many of the palace rooms were adapted to be rent-free apartments, with vacant ones allocated by the Lord Chamberlain to applicants to reward past services rendered to the Crown. From 1862 to his death in 1867, the scientist and pioneer of electricity Michael Faraday lived here. From the 1960s the number of new residents declined, with the last admitted in the 1980s. However existing residents could continue to live there. In 2005 three remained, with none by 2017.

In 1796, the Great Hall was restored and in 1838, during the reign of Queen Victoria, the restoration was completed and the palace opened to the public. The heavy-handed restoration plan at this time reduced the Great Gatehouse (&quot;A&quot;), the palace&#x27;s principal entrance, by two storeys and removed the lead cupolas adorning its four towers. Once opened, the palace soon became a major tourist attraction and, by 1881, over ten million visits had been recorded. Visitors arrived both by boat from London and via Hampton Court railway station, opened in February 1849.
On 2 September 1952, the palace was given statutory protection by being Grade I listed. Other buildings and structures within the grounds are separately Grade I listed, including the early 16th-century tilt yard tower (the only surviving example of the five original towers); Christopher Wren&#x27;s Lion gate built for Anne and George I; and the Tudor and 17th-century perimeter walls.

In 1986, the palace was damaged by a major fire, which spread to the King&#x27;s Apartments. The fire claimed the life of Lady Daphne Gale, widow of General Sir Richard Gale, who resided in a grace and favour apartment. She was in the habit of taking a lighted candle to her bedroom at night, which is thought to have started the fire. The Hampton Court fire led to a new programme of restoration work which was completed in 1990. The Royal School of Needlework moved to premises within the palace from Princes Gate in Kensington 1987, and the palace also houses the headquarters of Historic Royal Palaces, a charitable foundation.

===21st century===
The location was used for a performance of &quot;The Six Wives of Henry VIII&quot; by rock keyboardist Rick Wakeman in 2009.

The palace was the venue for the Road Cycling Time Trial of the 2012 Summer Olympics and temporary structures for the event, including a set of thrones for time trialists in the medal positions, were installed in the grounds.

In 2015, Hampton Court celebrated the 500th anniversary of the groundbreaking of construction of the palace. The celebrations included daily dramatised historical scenes. The palace&#x27;s construction began on 12 February 1515.

On 9 February the following year, Vincent Nichols, the Catholic archbishop of Westminster, celebrated vespers in the Chapel Royal. This was the first Catholic service held at the palace for 450 years, and the first since the Elizabethan Religious Settlement established Protestantism as the national denomination.

The palace houses many works of art and furnishings from the Royal Collection, mainly dating from the two principal periods of the palace&#x27;s construction, the early Tudor (Renaissance) and the late Stuart to the early Georgian period. In September 2015, the Royal Collection recorded 542 works (only those with images) as being located at Hampton Court, mostly paintings and furniture, but also ceramics and sculpture. The full current list can be obtained from their website. The single most important work is Andrea Mantegna&#x27;s &quot;Triumphs of Caesar&quot; housed in the Lower Orangery. The palace once housed the Raphael Cartoons, now kept at the Victoria and Albert Museum. Their former home, the Cartoon Gallery on the south side of the Fountain Court, was designed by Christopher Wren; copies painted in the 1690s by a minor artist, Henry Cooke, are now displayed in their place. Also on display are important collections of ceramics, including numerous pieces of blue and white porcelain collected by Queen Mary II, both Chinese imports and Delftware.
Much of the original furniture dates from the late 17th and early 18th centuries, including tables by Jean Pelletier, &quot;India back&quot; walnut chairs by Thomas Roberts and clocks and a barometer by Thomas Tompion. Several state beds are still in their original positions, as is the Throne Canopy in the King&#x27;s Privy Chamber. This room contains a crystal chandelier of , possibly the first such in the country.

The King&#x27;s Guard Chamber contains a large quantity of arms: muskets, pistols, swords, daggers, powder horns and pieces of armour arranged on the walls in decorative patterns. Bills exist for payment to a John Harris, dated 1699, for an arrangement believed to be that still seen today.

In addition, Hampton Court holds the majority of the Royal Ceremonial Dress Collection, with a smaller amount being held at Kensington Palace, where it is displayed. The collection of over 10,000 items includes clothing, sketches, letters, prints, photographs, diaries and scrapbooks. The dress collection has designated status from Arts Council England.

==The Chapel==

The timber and plaster ceiling of the chapel is considered the &quot;most important and magnificent in Britain&quot;, but is all that remains of the Tudor decoration, after redecoration supervised by Sir Christopher Wren. The altar is framed by a massive but plain oak reredos with garlands carved by Grinling Gibbons during the reign of Queen Anne. Opposite the altar, at first-floor level, is the royal pew where the royal family would attend services apart from the general congregation seated below.

The clergy, musicians and other ecclesiastical officers employed by the monarch at Hampton Court, as in other English royal premises, are known collectively as the Chapel Royal; properly used the term does not refer to a building.

==Grounds==
The grounds as they appear today were laid out in grand style in the late 17th century. There are no authentic remains of Henry VIII&#x27;s gardens, merely a small knot garden, planted in 1924, which hints at the gardens&#x27; 16th-century appearance. Today, the dominating feature of the grounds is the great landscaping scheme constructed for Sir Christopher Wren&#x27;s intended new palace. From a water-bounded semicircular parterre, the length of the east front, three avenues radiate in a crow&#x27;s foot pattern. The central avenue, containing not a walk or a drive, but the great canal known as the Long Water, was excavated during the reign of Charles II, in 1662. The design, radical at the time, is another immediately recognizable influence from Versailles and was indeed laid out by pupils of André Le Nôtre, Louis XIV&#x27;s landscape gardener.
On the south side of the palace is the Privy Garden bounded by semi-circular wrought iron gates by Jean Tijou. This garden, originally William III&#x27;s private garden, was replanted in 1992 in period style with manicured hollies and yews along a geometric system of paths.

On a raised site overlooking the Thames is a small pavilion, the Banqueting House. This was built , for informal meals and entertainments in the gardens rather than for the larger state dinners which would have taken place inside the palace itself. A nearby conservatory houses the &quot;Great Vine&quot;, planted in 1769; by 1968 it had a trunk thick and has a length of . It still produces an annual crop of grapes.

The palace included apartments for the use of favoured royal friends. One such apartment is described as being in &quot;The Pavilion and situated on the Home Park&quot; of Hampton Court Palace. This privilege was first extended about 1817 by Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn, to his friend, Lieutenant General James Moore, and his new bride, Cecilia Watson. George IV continued this arrangement following the death of Prince Edward on 23 January 1820. Queen Victoria continued the arrangement for the widow of General Moore, following his death on 24 April 1838. This particular apartment was used for 21 years or more and spanned three different sponsors.
A well-known curiosity of the palace&#x27;s grounds is Hampton Court Maze; planted in the 1690s by George London and Henry Wise for William III. It was originally planted with hornbeam; it has been repaired latterly using many different types of hedge. There is a 3D simulation of the maze, see the external links section.

Inspired by narrow views of a Tudor garden that can be seen through doorways in a painting, &quot;The Family of Henry VIII&quot;, hanging in the palace&#x27;s Haunted Gallery, a new garden in the style of Henry VIII&#x27;s 16th-century Privy Gardens, has been designed to celebrate the anniversary of that King&#x27;s accession to the throne. Sited on the former Chapel Court Garden, it has been planted with flowers and herbs from the 16th century and is completed by gilded heraldic beasts and bold green and white painted fences. The garden&#x27;s architect was Todd Longstaffe-Gowan.

The formal gardens and park are Grade I listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.

===King&#x27;s Beasts===

There are ten statues of heraldic animals, called the King&#x27;s Beasts, that stand on the bridge over the moat leading to the great gatehouse. Unlike the Queen&#x27;s Beasts in Kew Gardens, these statues represent the ancestry of King Henry VIII and his third wife Jane Seymour. The animals are: the lion of England, the Seymour lion, the royal dragon, the black bull of Clarence, the yale of Beaufort, the white lion of Mortimer, the White Greyhound of Richmond, the Tudor dragon, the Seymour panther, and the Seymour unicorn. The set of Queen&#x27;s Beasts at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II replaced the three Seymour items and one of the dragons by the gryphon of Edward III, the horse of Hanover, the falcon of the Plantagenets, and the unicorn of Scotland.

In 2009 to celebrate the 500th anniversary of the accession to the throne of King Henry VIII, a new &quot;Tudor Garden&quot; was created in Chapel Court, Hampton Court, designed by Todd Longstaffe-Gowan. To decorate the garden eight small wooden King&#x27;s Beasts were carved and painted in bright colours, each sitting atop a 6-foot-high painted wooden column. The heraldic beasts, carved by Ben Harms and Ray Gonzalez of G&amp;H Studios, include the golden lion of England, the white greyhound of Richmond, the red dragon of Wales, and the white hart of Richard II, all carved from English oak. The historically correct colours were researched by Patrick Baty, paint/colour consultant at Hampton Court. The beasts are of a different design to those on the bridge, based on period drawings in the College of Arms.

==Transport links==
The palace is served by Hampton Court railway station which is immediately to the south of Hampton Court Bridge in East Molesey, and by London bus routes 111, 216, 411 and R68 from Kingston and Richmond.

==Cultural appearances and influence==
===Florham, United States===
Inspired by Wren&#x27;s work at Hampton Court, the American Vanderbilt family modelled their estate known as Florham, in Madison, New Jersey, US, after it. Florham was commissioned by Florence Adele Vanderbilt Twombly and Hamilton McKown Twombly from McKim, Mead &amp; White. It was built in 1893.

===Film location===
The palace has been used as a location for filming film and television shows, including &quot;The Private Life of Henry VIII&quot;, &quot;Three Men In A Boat&quot;, &quot;A Man For All Seasons&quot;, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, &quot;Little Dorrit&quot;, &quot;John Adams&quot; (2008), &quot;The Young Victoria&quot;, &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides&quot;, &quot;Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows&quot;, &quot;The Theory of Everything&quot;, &quot;Cinderella,&quot; &quot;Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again!&quot;, &quot;The Favourite&quot;, &quot;Belgravia&quot;, &quot;The Great,&quot; and &quot;Bridgerton&quot;. Some scenes of the spin-off series, &quot;Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story&quot;, were also filmed at the palace.

===Poetry===
Lydia Sigourney&#x27;s poem &quot;Hampton Court&quot; records a visit to the palace with the bridal party following a wedding in March, 1841. It was published in her &quot;Pleasant Memories of Pleasant Lands&quot; in 1842.
