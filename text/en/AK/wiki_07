<text>A tyrosine kinase is an enzyme that can transfer a phosphate group from ATP to the tyrosine residues of specific proteins inside a cell. It functions as an &quot;on&quot; or &quot;off&quot; switch in many cellular functions.

Tyrosine kinases belong to a larger class of enzymes known as protein kinases which also attach phosphates to other amino acids such as serine and threonine. Phosphorylation of proteins by kinases is an important mechanism for communicating signals within a cell (signal transduction) and regulating cellular activity, such as cell division.

Protein kinases can become mutated, stuck in the &quot;on&quot; position, and cause unregulated growth of the cell, which is a necessary step for the development of cancer. Therefore, kinase inhibitors, such as imatinib and osimertinib, are often effective cancer treatments.

Most tyrosine kinases have an associated protein tyrosine phosphatase, which removes the phosphate group.

== Reaction ==

Protein kinases are a group of enzymes that possess a catalytic subunit that transfers the gamma (terminal) phosphate from nucleoside triphosphates (often ATP) to one or more amino acid residues in a protein substrate side-chain, resulting in a conformational change affecting protein function. The enzymes fall into two broad classes, characterised with respect to substrate specificity: serine/threonine-specific, and tyrosine-specific (the subject of this article).

== Function ==
Kinase is a large family of enzymes that are responsible for catalyzing the transfer of a phosphoryl group from a nucleoside triphosphate donor, such as ATP, to an acceptor molecule. Tyrosine kinases catalyze the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in proteins. The phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in turn causes a change in the function of the protein that they are contained in.

Phosphorylation at tyrosine residues controls a wide range of properties in proteins such as enzyme activity, subcellular localization, and interaction between molecules. Furthermore, tyrosine kinases function in many signal transduction cascades wherein extracellular signals are transmitted through the cell membrane to the cytoplasm and often to the nucleus, where gene expression may be modified. Finally mutations can cause some tyrosine kinases to become constitutively active, a nonstop functional state that may contribute to initiation or progression of cancer.

Tyrosine kinases function in a variety of processes, pathways, and actions, and are responsible for key events in the body. The receptor tyrosine kinases function in transmembrane signaling, whereas tyrosine kinases within the cell function in signal transduction to the nucleus. Tyrosine kinase activity in the nucleus involves cell-cycle control and properties of transcription factors. In this way, in fact, tyrosine kinase activity is involved in mitogenesis, or the induction of mitosis in a cell; proteins in the cytosol and proteins in the nucleus are phosphorylated at tyrosine residues during this process. Cellular growth and reproduction may rely to some degree on tyrosine kinase. Tyrosine kinase function has been observed in the nuclear matrix, which comprises not the chromatin but rather the nuclear envelope and a “fibrous web” that serves to physically stabilize DNA. To be specific, Lyn, a type of kinase in the Src family that was identified in the nuclear matrix, appears to control the cell cycle. Src family tyrosine kinases are closely related but demonstrate a wide variety of functionality. Roles or expressions of Src family tyrosine kinases vary significantly according to cell type, as well as during cell growth and differentiation. Lyn and Src family tyrosine kinases in general have been known to function in signal transduction pathways. There is evidence that Lyn is localized at the cell membrane; Lyn is associated both physically and functionally with a variety of receptor molecules.

Fibroblasts – a type of cell that synthesizes the extracellular matrix and collagen and is involved in wound healing – that have been transformed by the polyomavirus possess higher tyrosine activity in the cellular matrix. Furthermore, tyrosine kinase activity has been determined to be correlated to cellular transformation. It has also been demonstrated that phosphorylation of a middle-T antigen on tyrosine is also associated with cell transformation, a change that is similar to cellular growth or reproduction.

The transmission of mechanical force and regulatory signals are quite fundamental in the normal survival of a living organism. Protein tyrosine kinase plays a role in this task, too. A protein tyrosine kinase called pp125, also referred to as focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is likely at hand in the influence of cellular focal adhesions, as indicated by an immunofluorescent localization of FAK. Focal adhesions are macromolecular structures that function in the transmission of mechanical force and regulatory signals.

Cellular proliferation, as explained in some detail above, may rely in some part on tyrosine kinase. Tyrosine kinase function has been observed in the nuclear matrix. Lyn, the type of kinase that was the first to be discovered in the nuclear matrix, is part of Src family of tyrosine kinases, which can be contained in the nucleus of differentiating, calcium-provoked kertinocytes. Lyn, in the nuclear matrix, among the nuclear envelope and the “fibrous web” that physically stabilizes DNA, was found functioning in association with the matrix. Also, it appeared to be conditional to cell cycle. The contribution of the Lyn protein to the total tyrosine kinase activity within the nuclear matrix is unknown, however; because the Lyn was extracted only partially, an accurate measurement of its activity could not be managed. Indications, as such, are that, according to Vegesna &quot;et al.&quot; (1996), Lyn polypeptides are associated with tyrosine kinase activity in the nuclear matrix. The extracted Lyn was enzymatically active, offering support for this notion.

Yet another possible and probable role of protein tyrosine kinase is that in the event of circulatory failure and organ dysfunction caused by endotoxin in rats, where the effects of inhibitors tyrphostin and genistein are involved with protein tyrosine kinase. Signals in the surroundings received by receptors in the membranes of cells are transmitted into the cell cytoplasm. Transmembrane signaling due to receptor tyrosine kinases, according to Bae &quot;et al.&quot; (2009), relies heavily on interactions, for example, mediated by the SH2 protein domain; it has been determined via experimentation that the SH2 protein domain selectivity is functional in mediating cellular processes involving tyrosine kinase. Receptor tyrosine kinases may, by this method, influence growth factor receptor signaling. This is one of the more fundamental cellular communication functions metazoans.

== Regulation ==
Major changes are sometimes induced when the tyrosine kinase enzyme is affected by other factors. One of the factors is a molecule that is bound reversibly by a protein, called a ligand. A number of receptor tyrosine kinases, though certainly not all, do not perform protein-kinase activity until they are occupied, or activated, by one of these ligands. Although more research indicates that receptors remain active within endosomes, it was once thought that endocytosis caused by ligands was the event responsible for the process in which receptors are inactivated. Activated receptor tyrosine kinase receptors are internalized (recycled back into the system) in short time and are ultimately delivered to lysosomes, where they become work-adjacent to the catabolic acid hydrolases that partake in digestion. Internalized signaling complexes are involved in different roles in different receptor tyrosine kinase systems, the specifics of which were researched. In addition, ligands participate in reversible binding, with inhibitors binding non-covalently (inhibition of different types are effected depending on whether these inhibitors bind the enzyme, the enzyme-substrate complex, or both). Multivalency, which is an attribute that bears particular interest to some people involved in related scientific research, is a phenomenon characterized by the concurrent binding of several ligands positioned on one unit to several coinciding receptors on another. In any case, the binding of the ligand to its partner is apparent owing to the effects that it can have on the functionality of many proteins. Ligand-activated receptor tyrosine kinases, as they are sometimes referred to, demonstrate a unique attribute. Once a tyrosine receptor kinase is bonded to its ligand, it is able to bind to tyrosine kinase residing in the cytosol of the cell.

===Erythrocytes===
An example of this trigger-system in action is the process by which the formation of erythrocytes is regulated. Mammals possess this system, which begins in the kidneys where the developmental signal is manufactured. The developmental signal, also called a cytokine, is erythropoietin in this case. (Cytokines are key regulators of hematopoietic cell proliferation and differentiation.) Erythropoietin&#x27;s activity is initiated when hematopoietic cytokine receptors become activated. In erythrocyte regulation, erythropoietin is a protein containing 165 amino acids that plays a role in activating the cytoplasmic protein kinase JAK. The results of some newer research have also indicated that the aforementioned cytokine receptors function with members of the JAK tyrosine kinase family. The cytokine receptors activate the JAK kinases. This then results in the phosphorylation of several signaling proteins located in the cell membrane. This subsequently affects both the stimulation of ligand-mediated receptors and intracellular signaling pathway activation. Substrates for JAK kinases mediate some gene responses and more. The process is also responsible for mediating the production of blood cells. In this case, erythropoietin binds to the corresponding plasma membrane receptor, dimerizing the receptor. The dimer is responsible for activating the kinase JAK via binding. Tyrosine residues located in the cytoplasmic domain of the erythropoietin receptor are consequently phosphorylated by the activated protein kinase JAK. Overall, this is also how a receptor tyrosine kinase might be activated by a ligand to regulate erythrocyte formation.

===Other examples===
Additional instances of factor-influenced protein tyrosine kinase activity, similar to this one, exist. An adapter protein such as Grb2 will bind to phosphate-tyrosine residues under the influence of receptor protein kinases. This mechanism is an ordinary one that provokes protein-protein interactions.

Furthermore, to illustrate an extra circumstance, insulin-associated factors have been determined to influence tyrosine kinase. Insulin receptor substrates are molecules that function in signaling by regulating the effects of insulin. Many receptor enzymes have closely related structure and receptor tyrosine kinase activity, and it has been determined that the foundational or prototypical receptor enzyme is insulin. Insulin receptor substrates IRS2 and IRS3 each have unique characteristic tissue function and distribution that serves to enhance signaling capabilities in pathways that are initiated by receptor tyrosine kinases. Activated IRS-1 molecules &quot;enhance&quot; the signal created by insulin. The insulin receptor system, in contrast, appears to &quot;diminish&quot; the efficacy of endosomal signaling.

The epidermal growth factor receptor system, as such, has been used as an intermediate example. Some signals are produced from the actual cell surface in this case but other signals seem to emanate from within the endosomes. This variety of function may be a means to create ligand-specific signals. This supports the notion that trafficking, a term for the modification of proteins subsequent to mRNA translation, may be vital to the function of receptor signaling.

== Structure ==
Protein tyrosine kinase proteins contain a Protein kinase domain, which consists of an N-terminal lobe comprising 5 beta sheet strands and an alpha helix called the C-helix, and a C-terminal domain usually comprising 6 alpha helices (helices D, E, F, G, H, and I). Two loops in the center of the kinase domain control catalysis. The catalytic loop contains the HRD motif (usually with sequence His-Arg-Asp). The aspartic acid of this motif forms a hydrogen bond with the substrate OH group on Tyr during catalysis. The other loop is the activation loop, whose position and conformation determine in part whether the kinase is active or inactive. The activation loop begins with the DFG motif (usually with sequence Asp-Phe-Gly).

There are over 1800 3D structures of tyrosine kinases available in the Protein Data Bank. An example is , the crystal structure of the tyrosine kinase domain of the human insulin receptor.

== Families ==
There are 90 human genes that contain a total of 94 protein tyrosine kinase domains (PTKs). Four genes contain both a catalytically active kinase domain and a pseudokinase domain (a kinase domain with no catalytic activity: JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2). Including these four genes, there are 82 human genes that contain a catalytically active tyrosine kinase domain They are divided into two classes, receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases.

===Receptor===

By 2004, 58 human receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) were known, grouped into 20 subfamilies. Eight of these membrane proteins which contain tyrosine protein kinase domains are actually pseudokinases, without catalytic activity (EPHA10, EPHB6, ERBB3, PTK7, ROR1, ROR2, RYK, and STYK1). Receptor tyrosine kinases play pivotal roles in diverse cellular activities including growth (by signaling neurotrophins), differentiation, metabolism, adhesion, motility, and death.
RTKs are composed of an extracellular domain, which is able to bind a specific ligand, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular catalytic domain, which is able to bind and phosphorylate selected substrates. Binding of a ligand to the extracellular region causes a series of structural rearrangements in the RTK that lead to its enzymatic activation. In particular, movement of some parts of the kinase domain gives free access to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and the substrate to the active site. This triggers a cascade of events through phosphorylation of intracellular proteins that ultimately transmit (&quot;transduce&quot;) the extracellular signal to the nucleus, causing changes in gene expression.
Many RTKs are involved in oncogenesis, either by gene mutation, or chromosome translocation, or simply by over-expression. In every case, the result is a hyper-active kinase, that confers an aberrant, ligand-independent, non-regulated growth stimulus to the cancer cells.

===Cytoplasmic/non-receptor===

In humans, there are 32 cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases ().

The first non-receptor tyrosine kinase identified was the &quot;v-src&quot; oncogenic protein. Most animal cells contain one or more members of the &quot;Src&quot; family of tyrosine kinases. A chicken sarcoma virus, the Rous sarcoma virus mentioned above, was found to carry mutated versions of the normal cellular Src gene. The mutated v-&quot;src&quot; gene has lost the normal built-in inhibition of enzyme activity that is characteristic of cellular SRC (c-&quot;src&quot;) genes. SRC family members have been found to regulate many cellular processes. For example, the T-cell antigen receptor leads to intracellular signalling by activation of &quot;Lck&quot; and &quot;Fyn&quot;, two proteins that are structurally similar to &quot;Src&quot;.

==Clinical significance==

Tyrosine kinases are particularly important today because of their implications in the treatment of cancer. A mutation that causes certain tyrosine kinases to be constitutively active has been associated with several cancers. Imatinib (brand names Gleevec and Glivec) is a drug able to bind the catalytic cleft of these tyrosine kinases, inhibiting its activity.

Tyrosine kinase activity is also significantly involved in other events that are sometimes considered highly unfavorable. For instance, enhanced activity of the enzyme has been implicated in the derangement of the function of certain systems, such as cell division. Also included are numerous diseases related to local inflammation such as atherosclerosis and psoriasis, or systemic inflammation such as sepsis and septic shock. A number of viruses target tyrosine kinase function during infection. The polyoma virus affects tyrosine kinase activity inside the nuclear matrix. Fibroblasts are cells involved in wound healing and cell structure formation in mammalian cells. When these cells are transformed by the polyoma virus, higher tyrosine activity is observed in the cellular matrix, which is also correlated to cellular proliferation. Another virus that targets tyrosine kinase is the Rous sarcoma virus, a retrovirus that causes sarcoma in chickens. Infected cells display obvious structure modifications and cell growth regulation that is extremely unusual. Protein tyrosine kinases that are encoded by the Rous sarcoma virus cause cellular transformation, and are termed oncoproteins. In addition, tyrosine kinase can sometimes function incorrectly in such a way that leads to non-small cell lung cancer. A common, widespread cancer, non-small cell lung cancer is the cause of death in more people than the total number in breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer together.

Research has shown that protein phosphorylation occurs on residues of tyrosine by both transmembrane receptor- and membrane-associated protein tyrosine kinases in normal cells. Phosphorylation plays a significant role in cellular signalling that regulates the number and variety of growth factors. This is evidenced by the observation that cells affected by the Rous sarcoma virus display obvious structural modifications and a total lack of normal cell growth regulation. Rous sarcoma virus-encoded oncoproteins are protein tyrosine kinases that are the cause of, and are required for, this cellular transformation. Tyrosine phosphorylation activity also increases or decreases in conjunction with changes in cell composition and growth regulation. In this way, a certain transformation exhibited by cells is dependent on a role that tyrosine kinase demonstrates. Protein tyrosine kinases, have a major role in the activation of lymphocytes. In addition, they are functional in mediating communication pathways in cell types such as adrenal chromaffin, platelets, and neural cells.

A tyrosine kinase can become an unregulated enzyme within an organism due to influences discussed, such as mutations and more. This behavior causes havoc; essential processes become disorganized. Systems on which the organism relies malfunction, resulting often in cancers. Preventing this type of circumstance is highly desirable. Much research has already noted the significant effect that inhibitors of the radically functioning protein tyrosine kinase enzymes have on related ailments. (See Tyrosine-kinase inhibitor )

=== Non-small cell lung cancer ===
Cancer&#x27;s response to an inhibitor of tyrosine kinase was assessed in a clinical trial. In this case, Gefitinib is the inhibitor of tyrosine kinase. Incorrect tyrosine kinase function can lead to non-small cell lung cancer. Gefitinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets the epidermal growth factor receptor, inducing favorable outcomes in patients with non-small cell lung cancers. A common, widespread cancer, non-small cell lung cancer is the cause of death in more people than breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer together. This is strong motivation to perform research on tyrosine kinase inhibitors as potential targets in cancer treatment. Gefitinib, functioning as an epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, improved symptoms related to non-small cell lung cancer and resulted in radiographic tumor regressions. This is an example of the efficacy of such an inhibitor. The process of inhibition shows how the cancer sustains. Mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor activate signalling pathways that promote cell survival. Non-small cell lung cancer cells become dependent on these survival signals. Gefitinib&#x27;s inhibition of the survival signals may be a contributing factor to its efficacy as a drug for non-small cell cancer treatment.

Gefitinib is well endured by humans, and treatment resulted in a symptom improvement rate of 43% (with 95% confidence in a 33%–53% interval) for patients that received 250 mg of Gefitinib and 35% (with 95% confidence in a 26%–45% interval) for those that received 500 mg. In the trial, epidermal growth factor receptor showed a rapid response to the inhibitor, as demonstrated by the improvement of the cancer symptoms. In each group, improvements were noted after a single week of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment. Gefitinib application once per day caused “rapid” symptom improvement and tumor regressions in non-small cell lung cancer patients. In the field of medical research, this is an especially significant example of the use of an inhibitor to treat tyrosine kinase-associated cancer. Chemotherapy, surgery, and radiotherapy were the only major options available prior to the discoveries made in this trial. The side-effects of Gefitinib oral treatment once per day were considered significant. Diarrhea was reported in 57% of patients in the 250 mg group and in 75% of the 500 mg group. One patient had diarrhea more severe than Grade 2, with up to six bowel movements in only one day. Also, a death occurred possibly due to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment; however, the correlation is not exactly clear. In addition, skin toxicity was observed in 62% of patients in the 250 mg group. Nevertheless, the side-effects of Gefitinib were only “generally mild, manageable, noncumulative, and reversible.” Unfortunately, ceasing to take the inhibitor may be the only reversal strategy of the unfavorable symptoms. Gefitinib still represents a reasonably safe and effective treatment compared to other cancer therapies.

Furthermore, epidermal growth factor receptor plays a crucial role in tumorigenesis, which is the production of a new tumor. By 2010 Two monoclonal antibodies and another small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor called Erlotinib had also been developed to treat cancer.

July 12, 2013 FDA approved afatinib &quot;multiple receptor, irreversible TKI&quot; for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation

=== Chronic myeloid leukemia ===
BCR-ABL is a constitutively activated tyrosine kinase that is associated with chronic myeloid leukemia. It is formed from a fusion gene when pieces of chromosomes 9 and 22 break off and trade places. The ABL gene from chromosome 9 joins to the BCR gene on chromosome 22, to form the BCR-ABL fusion gene. Tyrosine kinase activity is crucial for the transformation of BCR-ABL. Therefore, inhibiting it improves cancer symptoms. Among currently available inhibitors to treat CML are imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib and ponatinib.

=== Gastrointestinal stromal tumors ===
Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are known to withstand cancer chemotherapy treatment and do not respond to any kind of therapy (in 2001) in advanced cases. However, tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571 (imatinib) is effective in the treatment of patients with metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors consist of a cluster of mesenchymal neoplasms that are formed from precursors to cells that make up the connective-tissue in the gastrointestinal tract. Most of these tumors are found in the stomach, though they can also be located in the small intestine or elsewhere in the intestinal tract. The cells of these tumors have a growth factor receptor associated with tyrosine kinase activity. This growth factor receptor is called c-kit and is produced by a proto-oncogene (&quot;c-kit&quot;). Mutation of c-kit causes the constitutive activity of tyrosine kinase, which results in cancerous gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Results of c-kit mutation include unrestricted tyrosine kinase activity and cell proliferation, unregulated phosphorylation of c-kit, and disruption of some communication pathways. Therapy with imatinib can inhibit the non-normal cell signaling mechanisms in gastrointestinal stromal tumors. This results in significant responses in patients and sustained disease control. By 2001 it was no longer doubted that this inhibitor can be effective and safe in humans. In similar manner, protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571 was found to significantly reduce the physical size of tumors; they decreased roughly 65% in size in 4 months of trialing, and continued to diminish. New lesions did not appear, and a number of the liver metastases completely reduced to non-existence. The single patient in the study remained healthy following treatment. There are no effective means of treatment for advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors, but that STI571 represents an effective treatment in early stage cancer associated with constitutively active c-kit, by inhibiting unfavourable tyrosine kinase activity. 

== Inhibitors ==

To reduce enzyme activity, inhibitor molecules bind to enzymes. Reducing enzyme activity can disable a pathogen or correct an incorrectly function system; as such, many enzyme inhibitors are developed to be used as drugs by the general public.

===GIST and Imatinib===
Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are mesenchymal tumors that affect the gastrointestinal tract. Treatment options have been limited. However Imatinib, as an inhibitor to the malfunctioning enzyme, can be effective.

===Chronic myelogenous leukemia and nilotinib===
If imatinib does not work, patients with advanced chronic myelogenous leukemia can use nilotinib, dasatinib, bosutinib, ponatinib, or another inhibitor to the malfunction enzyme that causes the leukemia. This inhibitor is a highly selective Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor.

===Others===
Sunitinib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor that acts upon vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), stem cell factor receptor, and colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (Burstein &quot;et al.&quot; 2008)

Gefitinib and erlotinib inhibit the tyrosine kinase domain of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and can be used to treat lung and pancreatic cancer where there is often over-expression of this cell-surface receptor tyrosine kinase.

Kinase inhibitors can also be mediated. Paracrine signalling mediates the response to epidermal growth factor receptor kinase inhibitors. Paracrine activates epidermal growth factor receptor in endothelial cells of the tumor to do this.

Dasatinib is a Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is effective both as a senolytic and as therapy for chronic myelogenous leukemia.

<text>Henry Mancini ( ; born Enrico Nicola Mancini; April 16, 1924 – June 14, 1994) was an American composer, conductor, arranger, pianist and flutist. Often cited as one of the greatest composers in the history of film, he won four Academy Awards, a Golden Globe, and twenty Grammy Awards, plus a posthumous Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1995.

His works include the theme and soundtrack for the &quot;Peter Gunn&quot; television series as well as the music for &quot;The Pink Panther&quot; film series (&quot;The Pink Panther Theme&quot;) and &quot;Moon River&quot; from &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot;. &quot;The Music from Peter Gunn&quot; won the inaugural Grammy Award for Album of the Year. Mancini enjoyed a long collaboration in composing film scores for the film director Blake Edwards. Mancini also scored a No. 1 hit single during the rock era on the Hot 100: his arrangement and recording of the &quot;Love Theme from &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;&quot; spent two weeks at the top, starting with the week ending June 28, 1969.

==Early life==
Henry Mancini was born Enrico Nicola Mancini in Maple Heights, Ohio, and raised in West Aliquippa, Pennsylvania. Both his parents were Italian immigrants. Originally from Scanno, Abruzzo, his father Quintiliano &quot;Quinto&quot; Mancini was a laborer at the Jones and Laughlin Steel Company and amateur musician who first came to the U.S. as a teenager around 1910. His mother Anna () came to the U.S. from Forlì del Sannio, Molise, as an infant.

At age eight, Mancini began learning the piccolo. Mancini said that hearing Rudolph G. Kopp&#x27;s score in the 1935 Cecil B. DeMille film &quot;The Crusades&quot; inspired him to pursue film music composition despite his father&#x27;s wishes for him to become a teacher.

At age 12, he began studying piano and orchestral arrangement under Pittsburgh concert pianist and Stanley Theatre (now Benedum Center) conductor Max Adkins. Not only did Mancini produce arrangements for the Stanley Theatre bands, but he also wrote an arrangement for Benny Goodman, an up-and-coming bandleader introduced to him by Adkins. According to Mancini biographer John Caps, the young Mancini &quot;preferred music arranging to any kind of musical performance, but taking apart a Chopin mazurka or Schumann sonata in order to play it helped him see...how the puzzle of form, meter, melody, harmony, and counterpoint had been solved by previous composers.&quot;

After graduating from Aliquippa High School in 1942, Mancini first attended the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University) in Pittsburgh. Later that year, Mancini transferred to the Juilliard School of Music in New York City following a successful audition in which he performed a Beethoven sonata and improvisation on &quot;Night and Day&quot; by Cole Porter. Because he could only take orchestration and composition courses in his second year, Mancini studied only piano in his first year at Juilliard, in a condition Caps called &quot;aimless and oppressed—a far cry from Adkins&#x27;s enabling protective environment.&quot;

After turning 18, Mancini enlisted in the United States Army Air Forces in 1943. While in basic training in Atlantic City, New Jersey, he met musicians being recruited by Glenn Miller. Owing to a recommendation by Miller, Mancini was first assigned to the 28th Air Force Band before being reassigned overseas to the 1306th Engineers Brigade in France. In 1945, he helped liberate the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp in Austria.

==Career==
Newly discharged from the military, Mancini entered the music industry. In 1946, he became a pianist and arranger for the newly re-formed Glenn Miller Orchestra, led by &#x27;Everyman&#x27; Tex Beneke. After World War II, Mancini broadened his skills in composition, counterpoint, harmony and orchestration during studies, opening with the composers Ernst Krenek and Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco.

In 1952, Mancini joined Universal-International&#x27;s music department. During the next six years, he contributed music to over 100 movies, most notably &quot;Creature from the Black Lagoon&quot;, &quot;The Creature Walks Among Us&quot;, &quot;It Came from Outer Space&quot;, &quot;Tarantula&quot;, &quot;This Island Earth&quot;, &quot;The Glenn Miller Story&quot; (for which he received his first Academy Award nomination), &quot;The Benny Goodman Story&quot; and Orson Welles&#x27; &quot;Touch of Evil&quot;. His first hit as a pop songwriter was a single by Guy Lombardo and His Royal Canadians titled &quot;I Won&#x27;t Let You Out of My Heart&quot;.

Mancini left Universal-International to work as an independent composer/arranger in 1958. Soon afterward, he scored the television series &quot;Peter Gunn&quot; for writer/producer Blake Edwards. This was the genesis of a relationship in which Edwards and Mancini collaborated on 30 films over 35 years. Along with Alex North, Elmer Bernstein, Leith Stevens and Johnny Mandel, Henry Mancini was a pioneer of the inclusion of jazz elements in the late romantic orchestral film and TV scoring prevalent at the time. Mancini&#x27;s scores for Blake Edwards included &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot; (with the standard &quot;Moon River&quot;) and &quot;Days of Wine and Roses&quot; (with the title song, &quot;Days of Wine and Roses&quot;), as well as &quot;Experiment in Terror&quot;, &quot;The Pink Panther&quot; (and all of its sequels), &quot;The Great Race&quot;, &quot;The Party&quot;, &quot;10&quot; (including &quot;It&#x27;s Easy to Say&quot;) and &quot;Victor Victoria&quot;. Another director with whom Mancini had a longstanding partnership was Stanley Donen (&quot;Charade&quot;, &quot;Arabesque&quot;, &quot;Two for the Road&quot;). Mancini also composed for Howard Hawks (&quot;Man&#x27;s Favorite Sport?&quot;, &quot;Hatari!&quot; – which included the &quot;Baby Elephant Walk&quot;), Martin Ritt (&quot;The Molly Maguires&quot;), Vittorio de Sica (&quot;Sunflower&quot;), Norman Jewison (&quot;Gaily, Gaily&quot;), Paul Newman (&quot;Sometimes a Great Notion&quot;, &quot;The Glass Menagerie)&quot;, Stanley Kramer (&quot;Oklahoma Crude&quot;), George Roy Hill (&quot;The Great Waldo Pepper&quot;), Arthur Hiller (&quot;Silver Streak&quot;), Ted Kotcheff (&quot;Who Is Killing the Great Chefs of Europe?&quot;), and others. Mancini&#x27;s score for the Alfred Hitchcock film &quot;Frenzy&quot; (1972) in Bachian organ andante, for organ and an orchestra of strings was rejected and replaced by Ron Goodwin&#x27;s work.

Mancini scored many TV movies, including &quot;The Moneychangers&quot;, &quot;The Thorn Birds&quot; and &quot;The Shadow Box&quot;. He wrote many television themes, including &quot;Mr. Lucky&quot; (starring John Vivyan and Ross Martin), &quot;NBC Mystery Movie&quot;, &quot;Tic Tac Dough&quot; (1990 version), &quot;Once Is Not Enough&quot;, and &quot;What&#x27;s Happening!!&quot; In the 1984–85 television season, four series featured original Mancini themes: &quot;Newhart&quot;, &quot;Hotel&quot;, &quot;Remington Steele&quot;, and &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not&quot;. Mancini also composed the &quot;Viewer Mail&quot; theme for &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;. Mancini composed the theme for &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; used beginning in 1975, and a different theme by him, titled &quot;Salute to the President&quot; was used by NBC News for its election coverage (including primaries and conventions) from 1976 to 1992. &quot;Salute to the President&quot; was published only in a school-band arrangement, although Mancini performed it frequently with symphony orchestras on his concert tours.

Songs with music by Mancini were staples of the easy listening radio format from the 1960s to the 1980s. To advertisers, Mancini&#x27;s style symbolized the bright, confident, hospitable voice of bourgeois America. Some of the artists who have recorded Mancini songs include Duane Eddy, Andy Williams, Paul Anka, Pat Boone, Anita Bryant, Jack Jones, Frank Sinatra, Perry Como, Connie Francis, Eydie Gorme, Steve Lawrence, Trini Lopez, George Maharis, Johnny Mathis, Jerry Vale, Ray Conniff, Quincy Jones, The Lennon Sisters, The Lettermen, Herb Alpert, Eddie Cano, Frank Chacksfield, Warren Covington, Sarah Vaughan, Shelly Manne, James Moody, Percy Faith, Ferrante &amp; Teicher, Horst Jankowski, Andre Kostelanetz, Peter Nero, Liberace, Mantovani, Tony Bennett, Julie London, Wayne Newton, Arthur Fiedler, Secret Agent and the Boston Pops Orchestra, Peggy Lee, and Matt Monro. The Anita Kerr Quartet won a Grammy award (1965) for their album &quot;We Dig Mancini&quot;, a cover of his songs. Lawrence Welk held Mancini in very high regard, and frequently featured Mancini&#x27;s music on &quot;The Lawrence Welk Show&quot; (Mancini made at least two guest appearances on the show). Mancini briefly hosted his own musical variety TV show in a similar format to Welk&#x27;s, &quot;The Mancini Generation&quot;, which aired in syndication during the 1972–73 season.

Mancini recorded over 90 albums, in styles ranging from big band to light classical to pop. Eight of these albums were certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America. He had a 20-year contract with RCA Victor, resulting in 60 commercial record albums that made him a household name among artists of easy listening music. Mancini&#x27;s earliest recordings in the 1950s and early 1960s were of the jazz idiom; with the success of &quot;Peter Gunn&quot;, &quot;Mr. Lucky&quot;, and &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot;, Mancini shifted to recording primarily his own music in record albums and film soundtracks. (Relatively little of his music was written for recordings compared to the amount that was written for film and television.) Beginning with his 1969 hit arrangement of Nino Rota&#x27;s &quot;A Time for Us&quot; (as his only &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 top 10 entry, the No. 1 hit &quot;Love Theme from &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;&quot;) and its accompanying album &quot;A Warm Shade of Ivory&quot;, Mancini began to function more as a piano soloist and easy-listening artist recording music primarily written by other people. In this period, for two of his best-selling albums he was joined by trumpet virtuoso and &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; bandleader Doc Severinsen.

Among Mancini&#x27;s orchestral scores are (&quot;Lifeforce&quot;, &quot;The Great Mouse Detective&quot;, &quot;Sunflower&quot;, &quot;Tom and Jerry: The Movie&quot;, &quot;Molly Maguires&quot;, &quot;The Hawaiians&quot;), and darker themes (&quot;Experiment in Terror&quot;, &quot;The White Dawn&quot;, &quot;Wait Until Dark&quot;, &quot;The Night Visitor&quot;).

Mancini was also a concert performer, conducting over fifty engagements per year, resulting in over 600 symphony performances during his lifetime. He conducted nearly all of the leading symphony orchestras of the world, including the London Symphony Orchestra, the Israel Philharmonic, the Boston Pops, the Los Angeles Philharmonic and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. One of his favorites was the Minnesota Orchestra, where he debuted the &quot;Thorn Birds Suite&quot; in June 1983. He appeared in 1966, 1980 and 1984 in command performances for the British Royal Family. He also toured several times with Johnny Mathis and also with Andy Williams, who had both sung many of Mancini&#x27;s songs; Mathis and Mancini collaborated on the 1986 album &quot;The Hollywood Musicals&quot;. In 1987 he conducted an impromptu charity concert in London in aid of Children In Need. The concert included Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;1812 Overture&quot; with firework accompaniment over the River Thames.

===Cameos===
Shortly before his death in 1994, he made a one-off cameo appearance in the first season of the sitcom series &quot;Frasier&quot;, as a call-in patient to Dr. Frasier Crane&#x27;s radio show. Mancini voiced the character Al, who speaks with a melancholy drawl and hates the sound of his own voice, in the episode &quot;Guess Who&#x27;s Coming to Breakfast?&quot; Moments after Mancini&#x27;s cameo ends, Frasier&#x27;s radio broadcast plays &quot;Moon River&quot;.

Mancini also had an uncredited performance as a pianist in the 1967 film &quot;Gunn&quot;, based on the &quot;Peter Gunn&quot; television series.

In the 1966 Pink Panther cartoon &quot;Pink, Plunk, Plink&quot;, the panther commandeered an orchestra and proceeded to conduct Mancini&#x27;s theme for the series. At the end, the shot switched to rare live action, and Mancini was seen alone applauding in the audience. Mancini also made a brief appearance in the title sequence of 1993&#x27;s &quot;Son of the Pink Panther&quot;, allowing the panther to conduct Bobby McFerrin in performing the film&#x27;s theme tune.

In 1969 at the 41st Academy Awards ceremony, Mancini played the harpsichord in a special number. Marni Nixon sang the rules for nomination in the category of Best Score of a Musical Motion Picture (Original or Adaptation), and together they sang the names of the films and musicians nominated. Mancini was the music director of the 41st Academy Awards broadcast.

==Death==
Mancini died of pancreatic cancer in Los Angeles on June 14, 1994. He was working at the time on the Broadway stage version of &quot;Victor/Victoria&quot;, which he never saw on stage. 

== Personal life ==
Mancini was survived by his wife of 47 years, singer Virginia &quot;Ginny&quot; O&#x27;Connor, with whom he had three children. She died on October 25, 2021, at age 97.

== Legacy ==
Henry Mancini created a scholarship at UCLA and some of his library and works are archived in the music library at UCLA, with additional materials preserved at the Library of Congress.

In 1996, the Henry Mancini Institute, an academy for young music professionals, was founded by Jack Elliott in Mancini&#x27;s honor, and was later under the direction of composer-conductor Patrick Williams. By the mid-2000s, however, the institute could not sustain itself and closed its doors on December 30, 2006. The American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) Foundation &quot;Henry Mancini Music Scholarship&quot; has been awarded annually since 2001.

In 2005, the Henry Mancini Arts Academy was opened as a division of the Lincoln Park Performing Arts Center. The center is located in Midland, Pennsylvania, minutes away from Mancini&#x27;s hometown of Aliquippa. The Henry Mancini Arts Academy is an evening-and-weekend performing arts program for children from pre-K to grade 12, with some classes also available for adults. The program includes dance, voice, musical theater, and instrumental lessons.

In 2017, the Municipality of Scanno dedicated a street to Mancini, called &quot;Via Henry Mancini&quot;.

The American Film Institute ranked Mancini&#x27;s songs &quot;Moon River&quot; No. 4 and &quot;Days of Wine and Roses&quot; No. 39 on their 100 Years...100 Songs list, and his score for &quot;The Pink Panther&quot; No. 20 on their list of the greatest film scores. His scores for &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot; (1961), &quot;Charade&quot; (1963), &quot;Hatari!&quot; (1962), &quot;Touch of Evil&quot; (1958) and &quot;Wait Until Dark&quot; (1967) were also nominated for the list.

==Awards and nominations==
Mancini was nominated for 72 Grammy Awards and won 20. He was nominated for 18 Academy Awards and won four. He also won a Golden Globe Award and was nominated for two Emmy Awards.

In 1961, Mancini won two Academy Awards, one for &quot;Moon River&quot; for Best Original Song and one for Best Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture for the movie &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot;. In 1962, he won Best Original Song again, this time for &quot;Days of Wine and Roses&quot;. He won Best Original Song Score and Its Adaptation or Best Adaptation Score again in 1982 for the movie &quot;Victor/Victoria&quot;.

In 1989, Mancini received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

In 1997, Mancini was posthumously awarded an honorary doctorate of music from Berklee College of Music.

On April 13, 2004, the United States Postal Service honored Mancini with a thirty-seven cent commemorative stamp. Painted by artist Victor Stabin, the stamp shows Mancini conducting in front of a list of some of his film and television themes.

===Soundtracks===
Most of Mancini&#x27;s scores were not released on LP soundtrack albums. His TV movie music albums were not soundtrack albums but are titled &quot;Music from ...&quot; or &quot;Music from the Motion Picture ...&quot; He routinely retained the rights to his music. Mancini&#x27;s contracts allowed him to release his own albums for which he rearranged the score music into arrangements more appropriate for listening outside of the context of the film/theater. Actual film scores using players from Hollywood unions recording under major motion picture studio contracts were expensive to release on LP (ex: the soundtrack for &quot;Our Man Flint&quot; (not a Mancini score) cost $1 more than other LP albums of the day). Many soundtrack albums used to claim &quot;Original Soundtrack&quot; or words to that effect, but were not necessarily the actual soundtrack recordings. These albums were usually recorded with a smaller orchestra than that used for the actual scoring (ex: Dimitri Tiomkin&#x27;s score to &quot;The Alamo&quot;). However, many Hollywood musicians were featured on Mancini&#x27;s albums recorded in RCA&#x27;s Hollywood recording studios and faux &quot;Original Soundtrack&quot; albums. Eventually some of his scores and faux &quot;Original Soundtrack&quot; scores by numerous composers were released in limited edition CDs.

<text>Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s is a 1961 American romantic comedy film directed by Blake Edwards from a screenplay by George Axelrod and based on the 1958 novella by Truman Capote. It stars Audrey Hepburn, George Peppard, Patricia Neal, Buddy Ebsen, Martin Balsam, and Mickey Rooney. In the film, Holly Golightly (Hepburn), a naïve, eccentric socialite meets Paul Varjak (Peppard), a struggling writer who moves into her apartment building.

Development for the film began soon after the publication of Capote&#x27;s novel, with several actors, including Marilyn Monroe, Shirley MacLaine, Kim Novak, Steve McQueen, Jack Lemmon, and Robert Wagner, considered for the lead roles prior to Hepburn and Peppard being cast. The screenplay, which deviates from Capote&#x27;s novella, was originally completed by Axelrod and director John Frankenheimer, who was replaced by Edwards well into pre-production. Principal photography began on October 2, 1960, with filming taking place in New York City and at the Studios at Paramount in Hollywood, California. The film&#x27;s music was composed by Henry Mancini and its theme song, &quot;Moon River&quot;, was written by Johnny Mercer.

&quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot; was released in the United States on October 5, 1961, by Paramount Pictures. It grossed $14 million worldwide and received critical acclaim for its music and Hepburn&#x27;s style and performance, being nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Actress for Hepburn, and winning two (Music Score of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture and Best Song for Mancini). The film also received numerous other accolades, although, Rooney&#x27;s portrayal of I. Y. Yunioshi garnered significant subsequent controversy for being racist. In 2012, the film was preserved in the U.S. National Film Registry by the Library of Congress.

==Plot==
Fending off a date from the night before, Holly Golightly visits the Tiffany &amp; Co. flagship store but her date finds her at her apartment building. Holly, who cannot find her keys, buzzes her landlord, Mr. Yunioshi, to let her in. Holly meets her new neighbor Paul Varjak as she readies to leave for her weekly visit to incarcerated mobster Sally Tomato. Tomato&#x27;s lawyer pays her $100 a week to deliver &quot;the weather report&quot;. Holly meets Paul&#x27;s &quot;decorator&quot; Emily Eustace Failenson, a wealthy older woman, whom Paul nicknames &quot;2E&quot;. That night, when Holly crawls out onto the fire escape to elude an over-eager date, she sees 2E leaving Paul money and kissing him goodbye.

Holly visits Paul and learns he is a writer who has not had anything published in five years, and has no ribbon in his typewriter. Holly explains she is saving money to support her brother, Fred, after he completes his Army service. The pair fall asleep but are awakened when Holly has a nightmare about Fred. When Paul questions her about this, Holly chides him for prying. Holly buys Paul a typewriter ribbon to apologize, and invites him to a party at her apartment. There, he meets her Hollywood agent, Berman, who describes Holly&#x27;s transformation from a country girl into a Manhattan &quot;socialite&quot;, along with wealthy Brazilian politician José da Silva Pereira and the wealthy American Rusty Trawler.

Some time later, 2E enters Paul&#x27;s apartment, worried about someone loitering outside the building. Paul confronts the man who explains he is Holly&#x27;s husband, Doc Golightly. Doc informs him that Holly ran away and he has come to bring her back to rural Texas. After Paul reunites them, Holly informs Paul the marriage was annulled and she declines to return with Doc. After drinking at a club, Paul and Holly return to her apartment, where she tells him she plans to marry Trawler for his money. A few days later, Paul learns a short story inspired by Holly will be published. On the way to tell Holly, he sees a newspaper headline stating that Trawler has married someone else.

Holly and Paul agree to spend the day together, taking turns doing things each has never done before. At Tiffany&#x27;s, he has the ring from a box of Cracker Jack engraved as a present for her. After spending the night together, Paul awakens to find Holly gone. 2E arrives and calmly accepts when he ends their affair, realizing he loves Holly. Returning from a date with José, Holly learns Fred has been killed and trashes her apartment.

Months later, Holly readies to move to Brazil and marry José but is arrested in connection to a drug ring run by Sally Tomato. Berman pays her bail and Paul picks her up in a cab with all her things, including her pet, Cat, and a breakup letter from José. Holly decides to go to Brazil anyway, breaking bail, as Paul declares that he loves her. Resistant to being in a relationship, Holly chastises him and releases Cat into an alley. Paul storms out of the cab, leaving the engraved ring with Holly. After she puts it on, Holly runs back to the alley, where Paul is looking for Cat. After Holly finds Cat, she cradles it in her coat and, smiling, walks into Paul&#x27;s embrace.

==Production==
===Development===
After Paramount producers Martin Jurow and Richard Shepherd optioned the film rights to Capote&#x27;s novella, they hired Sumner Locke Elliott to write its screenplay. Although this was generally faithful to the source material, Jurow and Shepherd disliked it and he was replaced by George Axelrod. Axelrod, who previously made structural changes to the source material while adapting &quot;The Seven Year Itch&quot; (1955), worked with Jurow and Shepherd to deviate from Capote&#x27;s novella. This included altering its plot and tone to be a romantic comedy, replacing its unnamed gay narrator with a named, heterosexual male love interest, adding new characters, and reducing the gay subtext.

Capote wanted Marilyn Monroe to play Holly Golightly: he considered Monroe to best reflect the character, with Axelrod required to &quot;tailor&quot; the screenplay to accommodate Monroe. Monroe declined to star in the film, opting for &quot;The Misfits&quot; (1961), after theatre director Lee Strasberg advised her that playing a &quot;lady of the evening&quot; would be bad for her image. The role was then offered to Shirley MacLaine, who turned it down in favor of starring in &quot;Two Loves&quot; (1961), and Kim Novak also turned it down.

Capote was angry at the studio&#x27;s eventual decision, remarking, &quot;Paramount double-crossed me in every way and cast Audrey&quot;. Hepburn was hesitant to star in the film, citing difficulty playing an extroverted character. Steve McQueen was offered the role of Paul Varjak, but declined the offer due to being under contract with United Artists, and Jack Lemmon was also approached, but was unavailable. Robert Wagner was also considered.

The film&#x27;s original director, John Frankenheimer, worked with Axelrod for three months on the project before he was replaced by Edwards after Hepburn&#x27;s agent requested a higher-profile director. Edwards also supported Axelrod&#x27;s changes to the novella, stating the changes made were for &quot;audience approval&quot;.

===Filming===

Filming began on Fifth Avenue outside the Tiffany &amp; Co. flagship store on October 2, 1960. Most of the exteriors were filmed in New York City, and all of the interiors, except for portions set inside Tiffany &amp; Co., were filmed on the Paramount Studios lot in Hollywood.

According to one report, the film&#x27;s on-location opening sequence outside Tiffany &amp; Co. was extremely difficult to shoot, due to issues related to crowd control, Hepburn&#x27;s dislike of pastries, and an accident that nearly resulted in the electrocution of a crew member. However, another report claims the sequence was captured rather quickly, owing to an unexpected lull in city traffic.

===Music===

During the film, Hepburn sang the film&#x27;s signature song, &quot;Moon River&quot;, written by Henry Mancini and Johnny Mercer. The song was tailored to Hepburn&#x27;s limited vocal range and its sequencing was inspired by songs she performed in &quot;Funny Face&quot; (1957). On the Anniversary Edition home media release featuring audio commentary by Shepherd, he stated that after the film&#x27;s test preview in San Francisco, Martin Rankin, Paramount&#x27;s head of production, wanted &quot;Moon River&quot; replaced with music sung by somebody else. Shepherd claimed he and Jurow refused to replace it – a response attributed to Hepburn herself in another account.

According to &quot;Time&quot;, Mancini &quot;sets off [the] melodies with a walking bass, extends them with choral and string variations and varies them with the brisk sounds of combo jazz. &quot;Moon River&quot; is sobbed by a plaintive harmonica, repeated by strings, hummed and then sung by the chorus and finally resolved with the harmonica.&quot; The soundtrack featured a score composed and conducted by Mancini, with several unreleased musical compositions not featuring in the final film. One piece, &quot;Carousel Cue&quot;, appears in a deleted scene, while another piece titled &quot;Outtake 1&quot; also appears in a deleted scene. In 2013, Intrada Records released the complete score in its original film performance: as with many soundtrack albums from the time period, the album initially released alongside the film was a re-recording.

==Release==
&quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot; was theatrically released by Paramount Pictures on October 5, 1961.
===Home media===

The film was first released on home media in the 1980s, on VHS and DVD, and was one of the first films featuring Hepburn released on home video. On February 7, 2006, a 45th anniversary special edition DVD was released in North America, containing featurettes not included on the prior releases. These included a photo gallery, the film&#x27;s theatrical trailer, a history featurette on Tiffany &amp; Co., audio commentary by Shepherd, a making-of featurette with interviews from Edwards and Neal, and a tribute to Hepburn, which contained a letter written by Hepburn to Tiffany &amp; Co. for their 150th anniversary in 1987.

On January 13, 2009, a remastered Centennial Collection version of the film was released, which added several new featurettes, including interviews by the cast, a documentary discussing the controversy regarding Rooney&#x27;s portrayal of I.Y. Yunioshi, an interactive tour of the Paramount Studios lot where filming took place, and a tribute to Mancini. On June 29, 2011, the film was digitally restored in high-definition and released on Blu-ray to commemorate its 50th anniversary.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot; was a commercial success, grossing $14 million on a $2.5 million budget. The film was screened at Radio City Music Hall before its theatrical release, where &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;a bright box office contender&quot;.

===Critical response===

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 88% of 56 critics&#x27; reviews are positive, with an average score of 7.5/10. The website&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;It contains some ugly anachronisms, but Blake Edwards is at his funniest in this iconic classic, and Audrey Hepburn absolutely lights up the screen.&quot; Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 77 out of 100, based on 13 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

&quot;Time&quot; magazine noted &quot;[Hepburn&#x27;s portrayal] is not much different from Capote&#x27;s [character]. She has kicked the weed but she is still jolly Holly who runs away to find some of the finer things of life.&quot; It also pointed out the differences to Capote&#x27;s novella, stating &quot;after that out-of-Capote beginning, Edwards goes on to an out-of-character end.&quot; Hepburn&#x27;s performance received rave reviews, with it considered to be one of her most memorable and identifiable roles. Almost a half century later, Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot; emphasized the level of Hepburn&#x27;s performance, stating, &quot;&quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot; set Hepburn on her Hollywood course&quot; and argued her performance in the film influenced her later roles.

Tinee Mae of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; also gave a positive review, saying, &quot;In the wrong hands, the unconventional, disorganized, sophisticated, innocent, utterly contradictory [lead] character could be a tiresome idiot. Audrey makes her as sweet as she is silly, as appealing as she is affected, a playgirl without scruples, a moth who doesn&#x27;t quite deserve to die in a flame.&quot; Mae also praised the &quot;slick&quot; and &quot;perceptive&quot; screenplay and the &quot;fine&quot; supporting cast, singling out Peppard, Ebsen, Balsam and Rooney. Henry T. Murdock of &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot; shines like a gem. Much of the iridescence comes from the richly impulsive performance by Hepburn as the scatterbrained, pathetic, fiercely independent lead. [Peppard] plays with understanding. Ebsen appears briefly, but to good effect [and] Rooney is too slapstick as the Japanese photographer. Edwards keeps things moving with a lilt.&quot; The film helped rejuvenate Ebsen&#x27;s career, as it helped him land the role as Jed Clampett on &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; (1962–1971).

A.H. Weiler of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film a &quot;completely unbelievable but wholly captivating flight into fancy composed of unequal dollops of comedy, romance, poignancy, funny colloquialisms and Manhattan&#x27;s swankiest East Side areas captured in the loveliest of colors&quot;. Weiler called Hepburn &quot;a genuinely charming, elfin waif who will be believed and adored when seen&quot; and further praised the performances of Peppard, Balsam, Rooney, Neal and Ebsen. Capote infamously disliked the film and Hepburn&#x27;s performance for deviating from his novella. Capote&#x27;s biographer, Gerald Clarke, characterized the film as a &quot;valentine to free-spirited women, [not] a cautionary tale about a little girl lost in the big city&quot;. He later labelled the film &quot;a sugar and spice confection&quot; and claimed Capote praised it as an independent work, but not as an adaptation. In later years, American Film Institute ranked the film No. 61 in 100 Years ... 100 Passions and &quot;Moon River&quot; as No. 4 in 100 Years ... 100 Songs. The film was also ranked No. 486 on &quot;Empire&quot;″s The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time list.

The success of the film helped revive George Peppard&#x27;s movie career after &quot;The Subterraneans&quot;.
===Accolades===
==Influence==

The image of Hepburn with her hair in a high chignon and carrying an oversized cigarette holder is considered one of the most iconic images of 20th century American cinema. The sunglasses worn by Hepburn, another popular item, were designed and manufactured in London by Oliver Goldsmith. In 2011, the sunglasses were re-released to mark the film&#x27;s 50th anniversary. One of three dresses designed by Givenchy for Hepburn to use in the film sold at auction by Christie&#x27;s on December 5, 2006, for £467,200 (~US$947,000), about seven times the reserve price.

The little black dress designed by Givenchy and worn by Hepburn is cited as one of the most iconic clothing items of the twentieth century and was described by &quot;Glamour&quot; as the most famous little black dress of all time. A second little black dress by Givenchy, which was styled with a wide-brimmed hat, influenced the comic book design for Catwoman by artist Adam Hughes and later inspired the costume for the character in &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot; (2012).

A diamond necklace at Tiffany&#x27;s that Hepburn&#x27;s character scorns as too flashy was the Tiffany Yellow Diamond, which Hepburn wore in publicity photos for the film. Tiffany and Co.&#x27;s established profile as a pre-eminent luxury retailer was further boosted by the popularity of the film.

==Controversy==

Since the 1990s, Rooney&#x27;s portrayal of I. Y. Yunioshi, which featured makeup and a prosthetic mouthpiece, has been subject to controversy and labelled as a caricatured approximation of a Japanese man. In the Bruce Lee biopic &quot;&quot; (1993), &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot; is used as an illustration of Hollywood&#x27;s racist depiction of East Asians: it is implied that Lee and his future wife, Linda Lee Cadwell, walked out of a screening of the film upon viewing Rooney&#x27;s performance.

Promotional materials released by Paramount for the film between October and December 1960 did not reveal Rooney to play Yunioshi, with press releases stating that an upcoming Japanese comedian named &quot;Ohayo Arigatou&quot; (&quot;hello&quot; and &quot;thank you&quot; in Japanese) would play the character. Other press releases featured false quotes, written in phonetically broken English, attributed to the fake comedian. Rooney eventually revealed his involvement in &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot; in a statement while wearing the makeup and prosthetic mouthpiece seen in the film.

Shepherd later claimed that he wanted to cast a Japanese actor to portray Yunioshi, but that Edwards overruled him. He also stated he did not believe &quot;[Rooney] didn&#x27;t play the part well&quot;. Shepherd later apologized for Rooney&#x27;s casting and performance, saying, &quot;If we could just change Mickey, I&#x27;d be thrilled with the [film].&quot; Although Axelrod expanded the role of Yunioshi in the screenplay compared to the novella, Edwards sought to use the character for comic relief and hired Rooney, his old roommate. Axelrod clashed with Edwards regarding the placement of Yunioshi in the film and convinced Hepburn to reshoot scenes for free in the hope that scenes featuring Yunioshi could be edited out, but was overruled by Edwards. Edwards later stated he &quot;would give anything to recast [Rooney]&quot; and he &quot;wished [he] had never done it&quot; but stressed it was not something he could &quot;undo&quot;.

In a 2008 interview, Rooney said he was &quot;heartbroken&quot; regarding the criticism, saying, &quot;Edwards wanted me to [portray] the character because he was a comedy director. We had fun doing it. Never [since] we made it [has] there been [any] complaints. Every place I&#x27;ve gone in the world people say [I] was so funny.&quot; Rooney later said that he would not have taken the role if he thought it was offensive.

The film continues to draw criticism for the character, with film historian Robert Osborne calling it &quot;such a racial slur. I blame Edwards. The caricature was totally embarrassing&quot;. It has also been the subject of censorship and petitions against its contemporary screening or labelling as a &quot;classic&quot;. In 2011, a group of viewers opposed a screening held by SyFy and the Brooklyn Bridge Park Corporation to commemorate the film, and in 2022, the broadcaster Channel 5 (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Paramount Global) aired the film in the UK with the scenes featuring Rooney removed.

==Adaptations==
In 2004, a musical adaptation of the film made its debut at The Muny in St. Louis. In May 2009, Anna Friel starred in a London stage adaptation that opened in September 2009 at the Haymarket Theatre. In March 2013, a new stage adaptation made its debut at the Cort Theater in New York City, starring Emilia Clarke.

<doc id="51908" wikidata="Q6702031" url="?curid=51908" title="Luke Helder">
<text>Lucas John Helder (born May 5, 1981) also known as the Midwest Pipe Bomber, is a former University of Wisconsin–Stout student from Pine Island, Minnesota, known for being the suspect in a series of pipe bombings.

He was arrested in 2002 as a suspect in pipe bombings in mailboxes, which injured several people. In 2004, he was found mentally incompetent to stand trial and is still incarcerated in a federal medical facility.

== Bombings ==
In 2002, while attending the University of Wisconsin–Stout, Helder planned to plant pipe bombs in mailboxes across the United States to create a smiley face shape on the United States map. The bombs, which were packed with BBs and nails, were rigged to explode as the mailboxes were opened. Completed and rigged bombs were found in Nebraska, Colorado, Texas, Illinois and Iowa. In Iowa, six people, including four mail carriers, were injured when the bombs detonated. Ultimately, Helder planted 18 bombs and covered . 

He was stopped by police in Nebraska, Oklahoma, and Colorado for speeding and failure to wear a seat belt, but was not arrested.
Eventually he was captured in rural Nevada before he managed to complete the full smile. At the time of his arrest, police were looking for an unknown suspect driving a black Honda Accord. Many newspapers reported that he was wearing a Kurt Cobain T-shirt. When he was intercepted after a 40-mile car chase, Helder held a gun to his head, but was convinced to lower it by Federal Bureau of Investigation negotiators. Law enforcement discovered more IEDs in his vehicle. The bombings were widely covered by the US news media.

== Personality, writings and theories ==

Helder was not at the top of his college class, but his professors described him as a reasonably good, quiet and polite student, and at first there was confusion as to what the motivation for the bombings could be. Family, friends, and many acquaintances referred to Helder as normal and without a propensity to hurt people. But his roommate noted that Helder had recently become obsessed with death, had begun smoking marijuana, and had been reciting extended monologues about his new spiritual beliefs to his friends (which they had mostly &quot;laughed off&quot;).

Within the year prior to his arrest, Helder had become passionate about astral projection techniques and came to believe that death of the flesh and body is not the end of existence, as evidenced by the manifesto he sent to &quot;The Badger Herald&quot; of the University of Wisconsin–Madison at the beginning of the bombing spree. The essay also includes statements such as &quot;I&#x27;m taking very drastic measure in attempt to provide this information to you... I will die/change in the end for this, but that&#x27;s ok, hahaha paradise awaits! I&#x27;m dismissing a few individuals from reality, to change all of you for the better&quot;

Notes attached to the bombs denounced government control over daily lives, denied that anyone who had died was really dead, and promised more of the same kind of message.

== Trial ==
In April 2004, a federal judge found Helder incompetent to stand trial. While a judge could free Helder if doctors find he is not a threat to society, legal experts doubt this possibility due to the violent nature of his crimes. He has been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder.

In 2013, a federal judge ordered Helder re-evaluated for competency to stand trial. Helder remains incarcerated in the Federal Medical Center in Rochester, Minnesota, as of 2023.

== Musical background ==

Prior to his bombing spree, Helder was a member of Apathy, a Rochester, Minnesota, three-piece grunge band. Although the band was successful only on a local scale, they recorded a CD, &quot;Sacks of People&quot;, at the end of their first summer together. They funded and released the album themselves. Helder was a fan of Kurt Cobain. He heavily decorated his dorm room with Nirvana posters and ephemera. A bandmate in Apathy remarked Helder had &quot;an interesting style of singing&quot; and would write much of the lyrics of the group&#x27;s tracks, not having a full understanding of their meaning.

When the news broke that Helder was the pipe bomber, the media made significant mention of his status as a musician.

<doc id="51910" wikidata="Q1027298" url="?curid=51910" title="Quantum key distribution">
<text>Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a secure communication method that implements a cryptographic protocol involving components of quantum mechanics. It enables two parties to produce a shared random secret key known only to them, which then can be used to encrypt and decrypt messages. The process of quantum key distribution is not to be confused with quantum cryptography, as it is the best-known example of a quantum-cryptographic task.

An important and unique property of quantum key distribution is the ability of the two communicating users to detect the presence of any third party trying to gain knowledge of the key. This results from a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics: the process of measuring a quantum system in general disturbs the system. A third party trying to eavesdrop on the key must in some way measure it, thus introducing detectable anomalies. By using quantum superpositions or quantum entanglement and transmitting information in quantum states, a communication system can be implemented that detects eavesdropping. If the level of eavesdropping is below a certain threshold, a key can be produced that is guaranteed to be secure (i.e., the eavesdropper has no information about it). Otherwise no secure key is possible, and communication is aborted.

The security of encryption that uses quantum key distribution relies on the foundations of quantum mechanics, in contrast to traditional public key cryptography, which relies on the computational difficulty of certain mathematical functions, and cannot provide any mathematical proof as to the actual complexity of reversing the one-way functions used. QKD has provable security based on information theory, and forward secrecy.

The main drawback of quantum-key distribution is that it usually relies on having an authenticated classical channel of communication. In modern cryptography, having an authenticated classical channel means that one already has exchanged either a symmetric key of sufficient length or public keys of sufficient security level. With such information already available, in practice one can achieve authenticated and sufficiently secure communication without using QKD, such as by using the Galois/Counter Mode of the Advanced Encryption Standard. Thus QKD does the work of a stream cipher at many times the cost.

Quantum key distribution is used to produce and distribute only a key, not to transmit any message data. This key can then be used with any chosen encryption algorithm to encrypt (and decrypt) a message, which can then be transmitted over a standard communication channel. The algorithm most commonly associated with QKD is the one-time pad, as it is provably secure when used with a secret, random key. In real-world situations, it is often also used with encryption using symmetric key algorithms like the Advanced Encryption Standard algorithm.

== Quantum key exchange ==
Quantum communication involves encoding information in quantum states, or qubits, as opposed to classical communication&#x27;s use of bits. Usually, photons are used for these quantum states. Quantum key distribution exploits certain properties of these quantum states to ensure its security. There are several different approaches to quantum key distribution, but they can be divided into two main categories depending on which property they exploit.

; Prepare-and-measure protocols : In contrast to classical physics, the act of measurement is an integral part of quantum mechanics. In general, measuring an unknown quantum state changes that state in some way. This is a consequence of quantum indeterminacy and can be exploited in order to detect any eavesdropping on communication (which necessarily involves measurement) and, more importantly, to calculate the amount of information that has been intercepted.

; Entanglement-based protocols : The quantum states of two (or more) separate objects can become linked together in such a way that they must be described by a combined quantum state, not as individual objects. This is known as entanglement and means that, for example, performing a measurement on one object affects the other. If an entangled pair of objects is shared between two parties, anyone intercepting either object alters the overall system, revealing the presence of the third party (and the amount of information they have gained).

These two approaches can each be further divided into three families of protocols: discrete variable, continuous variable and distributed phase reference coding. Discrete variable protocols were the first to be invented, and they remain the most widely implemented. The other two families are mainly concerned with overcoming practical limitations of experiments. The two protocols described below both use discrete variable coding.

=== BB84 protocol: Charles H. Bennett and Gilles Brassard (1984) ===

This protocol, known as BB84 after its inventors and year of publication, was originally described using photon polarization states to transmit the information. However, any two pairs of conjugate states can be used for the protocol, and many optical-fibre-based implementations described as BB84 use phase encoded states. The sender (traditionally referred to as Alice) and the receiver (Bob) are connected by a quantum communication channel which allows quantum states to be transmitted. In the case of photons this channel is generally either an optical fibre or simply free space. In addition they communicate via a public classical channel, for example using broadcast radio or the internet. The protocol is designed with the assumption that an eavesdropper (referred to as Eve) can interfere in any way with the quantum channel, while the classical channel needs to be authenticated.

The security of the protocol comes from encoding the information in non-orthogonal states. Quantum indeterminacy means that these states cannot in general be measured without disturbing the original state (see &quot;No-cloning theorem&quot;). BB84 uses two pairs of states, with each pair conjugate to the other pair, and the two states within a pair orthogonal to each other. Pairs of orthogonal states are referred to as a basis. The usual polarization state pairs used are either the rectilinear basis of vertical (0°) and horizontal (90°), the diagonal basis of 45° and 135° or the circular basis of left- and right-handedness. Any two of these bases are conjugate to each other, and so any two can be used in the protocol. Below the rectilinear and diagonal bases are used.

The first step in BB84 is quantum transmission. Alice creates a random bit (0 or 1) and then randomly selects one of her two bases (rectilinear or diagonal in this case) to transmit it in. She then prepares a photon polarization state depending both on the bit value and basis, as shown in the adjacent table. So for example a 0 is encoded in the rectilinear basis (+) as a vertical polarization state, and a 1 is encoded in the diagonal basis (x) as a 135° state. Alice then transmits a single photon in the state specified to Bob, using the quantum channel. This process is then repeated from the random bit stage, with Alice recording the state, basis and time of each photon sent.

According to quantum mechanics (particularly quantum indeterminacy), no possible measurement distinguishes between the 4 different polarization states, as they are not all orthogonal. The only possible measurement is between any two orthogonal states (an orthonormal basis). So, for example, measuring in the rectilinear basis gives a result of horizontal or vertical. If the photon was created as horizontal or vertical (as a rectilinear eigenstate) then this measures the correct state, but if it was created as 45° or 135° (diagonal eigenstates) then the rectilinear measurement instead returns either horizontal or vertical at random. Furthermore, after this measurement the photon is polarized in the state it was measured in (horizontal or vertical), with all information about its initial polarization lost.

As Bob does not know the basis the photons were encoded in, all he can do is to select a basis at random to measure in, either rectilinear or diagonal. He does this for each photon he receives, recording the time, measurement basis used and measurement result. After Bob has measured all the photons, he communicates with Alice over the public classical channel. Alice broadcasts the basis each photon was sent in, and Bob the basis each was measured in. They both discard photon measurements (bits) where Bob used a different basis, which is half on average, leaving half the bits as a shared key.

To check for the presence of an eavesdropper, Alice and Bob now compare a predetermined subset of their remaining bit strings. If a third party (usually referred to as Eve, for &quot;eavesdropper&quot;) has gained any information about the photons&#x27; polarization, this introduces errors in Bob&#x27;s measurements. Other environmental conditions can cause errors in a similar fashion. If more than formula_1 bits differ they abort the key and try again, possibly with a different quantum channel, as the security of the key cannot be guaranteed. formula_1 is chosen so that if the number of bits known to Eve is less than this, privacy amplification can be used to reduce Eve&#x27;s knowledge of the key to an arbitrarily small amount at the cost of reducing the length of the key.

=== E91 protocol: Artur Ekert (1991) ===

Artur Ekert&#x27;s scheme uses entangled pairs of photons. These can be created by Alice, by Bob, or by some source separate from both of them, including eavesdropper Eve. The photons are distributed so that Alice and Bob each end up with one photon from each pair.

The scheme relies on two properties of entanglement. First, the entangled states are perfectly correlated in the sense that if Alice and Bob both measure whether their particles have vertical or horizontal polarizations, they always get the same answer with 100% probability. The same is true if they both measure any other pair of complementary (orthogonal) polarizations. This necessitates that the two distant parties have exact directionality synchronization. However, the particular results are completely random; it is impossible for Alice to predict if she (and thus Bob) will get vertical polarization or horizontal polarization. Second, any attempt at eavesdropping by Eve destroys these correlations in a way that Alice and Bob can detect.

Similarly to BB84, the protocol involves a private measurement protocol before detecting the presence of Eve. The measurement stage involves Alice measuring each photon she receives using some basis from the set formula_3 while Bob chooses from formula_4 where formula_5 is the formula_6 of their key bits (thus discarding them as key bits, as they are no longer secret) the probability they find disagreement and identify the presence of Eve is

So to detect an eavesdropper with probability formula_7 Alice and Bob need to compare formula_8 key bits.

=== Man-in-the-middle attack ===
Quantum key distribution is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack when used without authentication to the same extent as any classical protocol, since no known principle of quantum mechanics can distinguish friend from foe. As in the classical case, Alice and Bob cannot authenticate each other and establish a secure connection without some means of verifying each other&#x27;s identities (such as an initial shared secret). If Alice and Bob have an initial shared secret then they can use an unconditionally secure authentication scheme (such as Carter-Wegman,) along with quantum key distribution to exponentially expand this key, using a small amount of the new key to authenticate the next session. Several methods to create this initial shared secret have been proposed, for example using a 3rd party or chaos theory. Nevertheless, only &quot;almost strongly universal&quot; family of hash functions can be used for unconditionally secure authentication.

=== Photon number splitting attack ===
In the BB84 protocol Alice sends quantum states to Bob using single photons. In practice many implementations use laser pulses attenuated to a very low level to send the quantum states. These laser pulses contain a very small number of photons, for example 0.2 photons per pulse, which are distributed according to a Poisson distribution. This means most pulses actually contain no photons (no pulse is sent), some pulses contain 1 photon (which is desired) and a few pulses contain 2 or more photons. If the pulse contains more than one photon, then Eve can split off the extra photons and transmit the remaining single photon to Bob. This is the basis of the photon number splitting attack, where Eve stores these extra photons in a quantum memory until Bob detects the remaining single photon and Alice reveals the encoding basis. Eve can then measure her photons in the correct basis and obtain information on the key without introducing detectable errors.

Even with the possibility of a PNS attack a secure key can still be generated, as shown in the GLLP security proof; however, a much higher amount of privacy amplification is needed reducing the secure key rate significantly (with PNS the rate scales as formula_9 as compared to formula_10 for a single photon sources, where formula_10 is the transmittance of the quantum channel).

There are several solutions to this problem. The most obvious is to use a true single photon 
source instead of an attenuated laser. While such sources are still at a developmental stage QKD has been carried out successfully with them. However, as current sources operate at a low efficiency and frequency key rates and transmission distances are limited. Another solution is to modify the BB84 protocol, as is done for example in the SARG04 protocol, in which the secure key rate scales as formula_12. The most promising solution is the decoy states in which Alice randomly sends some of her laser pulses with a lower average photon number. These decoy states can be used to detect a PNS attack, as Eve has no way to tell which pulses are signal and which decoy. Using this idea the secure key rate scales as formula_10, the same as for a single photon source. This idea has been implemented successfully first at the University of Toronto, and in several follow-up QKD experiments, allowing for high key rates secure against all known attacks.

=== Denial of service ===
Because currently a dedicated fibre optic line (or line of sight in free space) is required between the two points linked by quantum key distribution, a denial of service attack can be mounted by simply cutting or blocking the line. This is one of the motivations for the development of quantum key distribution networks, which would route communication via alternate links in case of disruption.

=== Trojan-horse attacks ===
A quantum key distribution system may be probed by Eve by sending bright light into the quantum channel and analyzing the back-reflections in a Trojan-horse attack. In a recent research study it has been shown that Eve discerns Bob&#x27;s secret basis choice with higher than 90% probability, breaching the security of the system.

=== Security proofs ===
If Eve is assumed to have unlimited resources, for example both classical and quantum computing power, there are many more attacks possible. BB84 has been proven secure against any attacks allowed by quantum mechanics, both for sending information using an ideal photon source which only ever emits a single photon at a time, and also using practical photon sources which sometimes emit multiphoton pulses. These proofs are unconditionally secure in the sense that no conditions are imposed on the resources available to the eavesdropper; however, there are other conditions required:
# Eve cannot physically access Alice and Bob&#x27;s encoding and decoding devices.
# The random number generators used by Alice and Bob must be trusted and truly random (for example a Quantum random number generator).
# The classical communication channel must be authenticated using an unconditionally secure authentication scheme.
# The message must be encrypted using one-time pad like scheme

== Quantum hacking ==
Hacking attacks target vulnerabilities in the operation of a QKD protocol or deficiencies in the components of the physical devices used in construction of the QKD system. If the equipment used in quantum key distribution can be tampered with, it could be made to generate keys that were not secure using a random number generator attack. Another common class of attacks is the Trojan horse attack which does not require physical access to the endpoints: rather than attempt to read Alice and Bob&#x27;s single photons, Eve sends a large pulse of light back to Alice in between transmitted photons. Alice&#x27;s equipment reflects some of Eve&#x27;s light, revealing the state of Alice&#x27;s basis (e.g., a polarizer). This attack can be detected, e.g. by using a classical detector to check the non-legitimate signals (i.e. light from Eve) entering Alice&#x27;s system. It is also conjectured that most hacking attacks can similarly be defeated by modifying the implementation, though there is no formal proof.

Several other attacks including faked-state attacks, phase remapping attacks, and time-shift attacks are now known. The time-shift attack has even been demonstrated on a commercial quantum cryptosystem. This is the first demonstration of quantum hacking against a non-homemade quantum key distribution system. Later on, the phase-remapping attack was also demonstrated on a specially configured, research oriented open QKD system (made and provided by the Swiss company Id Quantique under their Quantum Hacking program). It is one of the first &#x27;intercept-and-resend&#x27; attacks on top of a widely used QKD implementation in commercial QKD systems. This work has been widely reported in media.

The first attack that claimed to be able to eavesdrop the whole key without leaving any trace was demonstrated in 2010. It was experimentally shown that the single-photon detectors in two commercial devices could be fully remote-controlled using specially tailored bright illumination. In a spree of publications thereafter, the collaboration between the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Norway and Max Planck Institute for the Science of Light in Germany, has now demonstrated several methods to successfully eavesdrop on commercial QKD systems based on weaknesses of avalanche photodiodes (APDs) operating in gated mode. This has sparked research on new approaches to securing communications networks.

==Counterfactual quantum key distribution==

The task of distributing a secret key could be achieved even when the particle (on which the secret information, e.g. polarization, has been encoded) does not traverse through the quantum channel using a protocol developed by Tae-Gon Noh. Here Alice generates a photon which, by not taking a measurement until later, exists in a superposition of being in paths (a) and (b) simultaneously. Path (a) stays inside Alice&#x27;s secure device and path (b) goes to Bob. By rejecting the photons that Bob receives and only accepting the ones he doesn&#x27;t receive, Bob &amp; Alice can set up a secure channel, i.e. Eve&#x27;s attempts to read the &quot;counterfactual&quot; photons would still be detected. This protocol uses the quantum phenomenon whereby the possibility that a photon can be sent has an effect even when it is not sent. So-called interaction-free measurement also uses this quantum effect, as for example in the bomb testing problem, whereby an experimenter can conceptually determine which bombs are not duds without setting them off, except in a counterfactual sense.

== History ==
Quantum cryptography was proposed first by Stephen Wiesner, then at Columbia University in New York, who, in the early 1970s, introduced the concept of quantum conjugate coding. His seminal paper titled &quot;Conjugate Coding&quot; was rejected by IEEE Information Theory but was eventually published in 1983 in SIGACT News (15:1 pp. 78–88, 1983). In this paper he showed how to store or transmit two messages by encoding them in two &quot;conjugate observables&quot;, such as linear and circular polarization of light, so that either, but not both, of which may be received and decoded. He illustrated his idea with a design of unforgeable bank notes. A decade later, building upon this work, Charles H. Bennett, of the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center, and Gilles Brassard, of the University of Montreal, proposed a method for secure communication based on Wiesner&#x27;s &quot;conjugate observables&quot;. In 1990, Artur Ekert, then a PhD student at Wolfson College, University of Oxford, developed a different approach to quantum key distribution based on quantum entanglement.

== Future ==
The current commercial systems are aimed mainly at governments and corporations with high security requirements. Key distribution by courier is typically used in such cases, where traditional key distribution schemes are not believed to offer enough guarantee. This has the advantage of not being intrinsically distance limited, and despite long travel times the transfer rate can be high due to the availability of large capacity portable storage devices. The major difference of quantum key distribution is the ability to detect any interception of the key, whereas with courier the key security cannot be proven or tested. QKD (quantum key distribution) systems also have the advantage of being automatic, with greater reliability and lower operating costs than a secure human courier network.

Kak&#x27;s three-stage protocol has been proposed as a method for secure communication that is entirely quantum unlike quantum key distribution in which the cryptographic transformation uses classical algorithms.

Factors preventing wide adoption of quantum key distribution outside high security areas include the cost of equipment, and the lack of a demonstrated threat to existing key exchange protocols. However, with optic fibre networks already present in many countries the infrastructure is in place for a more widespread use.

An Industry Specification Group (ISG) of the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) has been set up to address standardisation issues in quantum cryptography.

European Metrology Institutes, in the context of dedicated projects, are developing measurements required to characterise components of QKD systems.

Toshiba Europe has been awarded a prestigious Institute of Physics Award for Business Innovation. This recognises Toshiba&#x27;s pioneering QKD technology developed over two decades of research, protecting communication infrastructure from present and future cyber-threats, and commercialising UK-manufactured products which pave the road to the quantum internet.

Toshiba also took the Semi Grand Prix award in the Solutions Category for the QKD has won the Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry Award in CEATEC AWARD 2021, the prestigious awards presented at CEATEC, Japan&#x27;s premier electronics industry trade show.

== Deprecation from governmental institutions ==

Because of the practical problems with quantum key distribution, some governmental organizations recommend the use of post-quantum cryptography (quantum resistant cryptography) instead. For example, the US National Security Agency, European Union Agency for Cybersecurity of EU (ENISA), UK&#x27;s National Cyber Security Centre, French Secretariat for Defense and Security (ANSSI), and German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) recommend post-quantum cryptography.

For example, the US National Security Agency addresses five issues:

# Quantum key distribution is only a partial solution. QKD generates keying material for an encryption algorithm that provides confidentiality. Such keying material could also be used in symmetric key cryptographic algorithms to provide integrity and authentication if one has the cryptographic assurance that the original QKD transmission comes from the desired entity (i.e. entity source authentication). QKD does not provide a means to authenticate the QKD transmission source. Therefore, source authentication requires the use of asymmetric cryptography or preplaced keys to provide that authentication. Moreover, the confidentiality services QKD offers can be provided by quantum-resistant cryptography, which is typically less expensive with a better understood risk profile.
# Quantum key distribution requires special purpose equipment. QKD is based on physical properties, and its security derives from unique physical layer communications. This requires users to lease dedicated fiber connections or physically manage free-space transmitters. It cannot be implemented in software or as a service on a network, and cannot be easily integrated into existing network equipment. Since QKD is hardware-based it also lacks flexibility for upgrades or security patches.
# Quantum key distribution increases infrastructure costs and insider threat risks. QKD networks frequently necessitate the use of trusted relays, entailing additional cost for secure facilities and additional security risk from insider threats. This eliminates many use cases from consideration.
# Securing and validating quantum key distribution is a significant challenge. The actual security provided by a QKD system is not the theoretical unconditional security from the laws of physics (as modeled and often suggested), but rather the more limited security that can be achieved by hardware and engineering designs. The tolerance for error in cryptographic security, however, is many orders of magnitude smaller than in most physical engineering scenarios making it very difficult to validate. The specific hardware used to perform QKD can introduce vulnerabilities, resulting in several well-publicized attacks on commercial QKD systems.
# Quantum key distribution increases the risk of denial of service. The sensitivity to an eavesdropper as the theoretical basis for QKD security claims also shows that denial of service is a significant risk for QKD.

In response to problem 1 above, attempts to deliver authentication keys using post-quantum cryptography (or quantum-resistant cryptography) have been proposed worldwide. On the other hand, quantum-resistant cryptography is cryptography belonging to the class of computational security. In 2015, a research result was already published that &quot;sufficient care must be taken in implementation to achieve information-theoretic security for the system as a whole when authentication keys that are not information-theoretic secure are used&quot; (if the authentication key is not information-theoretically secure, an attacker can break it to bring all classical and quantum communications under control and relay them to launch a man-in-the-middle attack).
Ericsson, a private company, also cites and points out the above problems and then presents a report that it may not be able to support the zero trust security model, which is a recent trend in network security technology.

<text>Legislation is the process or result of enrolling, enacting, or promulgating laws by a legislature, parliament, or analogous governing body. Before an item of legislation becomes law it may be known as a bill, and may be broadly referred to as &quot;legislation&quot; while it remains under consideration to distinguish it from other business. Legislation can have many purposes: to regulate, to authorize, to outlaw, to provide (funds), to sanction, to grant, to declare, or to restrict. It may be contrasted with a non-legislative act by an executive or administrative body under the authority of a legislative act.

==Overview==
Legislation to design or amend a bill requires identifying a concrete issue in a comprehensive way. When engaging in legislation, drafters and policy-makers must take into consideration the best possible avenues to address problem areas. Possible solutions within bill provisions might involve implementing sanctions, targeting indirect behaviors, authorizing agency action, etc.

Legislation is usually proposed by a member of the legislature (e.g. a member of Congress or Parliament), or by the executive, whereupon it is debated by members of the legislature and is often amended before passage. Most large legislatures enact only a small fraction of the bills proposed in a given session. Whether a given bill will be proposed is generally a matter of the legislative priorities of the government.

Legislation is regarded as one of the three main functions of government, which are often distinguished under the doctrine of the separation of powers. Those who have the formal power to &quot;create&quot; legislation are known as legislators; a judicial branch of government will have the formal power to &quot;interpret&quot; legislation (see statutory interpretation); the executive branch of government can act only within the powers and limits set by the law, which is the instrument by which the fundamental powers of government are established.

The function and procedures are primarily the responsibility of the legislature. However, there are situations where legislation is made by other bodies or means, such as when constitutional law or secondary legislation is enacted. Such other forms of law-making include referendums, orders in council or regulations. The term &quot;legislation&quot; is sometimes used to include these situations, or the term &quot;primary legislation&quot; may be used to exclude these other forms.

=== Public participation in legislation ===
All modern constitutions and fundamental laws contain and declare the concept and principle of popular sovereignty, which essentially means that the people are the ultimate source of public power or government authority. The concept of popular sovereignty holds simply that in a society organized for political action, the will of the people as a whole is the only right standard of political action. It can be regarded as an important element in the system of checks and balances and representative democracy. Therefore, the people are implicitly entitled even to directly participate in the process of law-making. This role of linking citizens and their government and legislators is closely related to the concept of legitimacy. The exercise of democratic control over the legislative system and the policy-making process can occur even when the public has only an elementary understanding of the national legislative institution and its membership. Civic education is a vital strategy for strengthening public participation and confidence in the legislative process.

==Dead letter==

The term &quot;&quot; refers to legislation that has not been revoked, but that has become inapplicable or obsolete, or is no longer enforced. In more simpler terms, it means that the legislation is gone. There are several types of dead letter laws. Some laws become obsolete because they are so hateful to their community that no one wishes them to be enforced (e.g., slavery). Similarly, some laws are unenforced because a majority wishes to circumvent them, even if they believe in the moral principle behind the law (e.g., prohibition). Finally, some laws are unenforced because no mechanism or resources were provided to enforce them. Such laws often become selectively enforced or tacked onto other crimes in the judicial process.

<text>I&#x27;m Sorry, I&#x27;ll Read That Again (often abbreviated as ISIRTA) was a BBC radio comedy programme that was developed from the 1964 Cambridge University Footlights revue, &quot;Cambridge Circus&quot;., as a scripted sketch show. It had a devoted youth following, with the live tapings enjoying very lively audiences, particularly when familiar themes and characters were repeated; a tradition that continued into the spinoff show &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot;.

The show ran for nine series and was first broadcast on 3 April 1964, a pilot programme having been broadcast on 30 December 1963 under the title &quot;Cambridge Circus&quot;, on the BBC Home Service (renamed BBC Radio 4 in September 1967). Series 1 comprised three episodes. Subsequent series were broadcast on the BBC Light Programme (renamed BBC Radio 2 in September 1967). Series 2 (1965) had nine episodes, series 3 (1966) and series 6 to 8 (1968 to 1970) each had thirteen episodes, while series 4 (1966–67) and 5 (1967) both had fourteen episodes. After a three-year hiatus, the ninth and final series was transmitted in November and December 1973, with eight episodes. An hour-long 25th anniversary show was broadcast in 1989, comically introduced as &quot;full frontal radio&quot;.

The title of the show derives from a phrase commonly used by BBC Announcers in the age of live radio, following an on-air flub: &quot;I&#x27;m sorry, I&#x27;ll read that again.&quot; Basing the show&#x27;s title on the phrase used to recover from a mistake set the tone for the series as an irreverent and loosely produced comedy show.

&quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot;, an unscripted comedy panel game which is a spin-off from ISIRTA, was first produced in 1972 (invented by ISIRTA regular Graeme Garden, who was anxious to develop a comedy format that didn&#x27;t involve a script deadline each week).

==Cast==
*Tim Brooke-Taylor (later one of the three members of The Goodies). He wrote humorous books on subjects including cricket and golf. He was a member of the cast of the television comedy series &quot;At Last the 1948 Show&quot; with John Cleese, Graham Chapman and Marty Feldman, and later appeared in Feldman&#x27;s television comedy series &quot;Marty&quot;. He acted in many other television sitcoms, and appeared in the 1970s BBC radio sketch show &quot;Hello, Cheeky!&quot; with John Junkin and Barry Cryer, later translated to ITV. He also appeared in the 1971 film &quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot; in the uncredited role of the computer scientist. Brooke-Taylor died in April 2020, aged 79.
*John Cleese (later part of Monty Python and star of &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot;) formed his own production company Video Arts in the 1970s to make business training films, which contained much Python-esque/Basil Fawlty-style humour, and also made films including &quot;A Fish Called Wanda&quot; and &quot;Fierce Creatures&quot;. On the 25th anniversary &quot;ISIRTA&quot; show, he performed his &quot;silly walk&quot; and sang &quot;The Ferret Song&quot;. He appeared in &quot;At Last the 1948 Show&quot; in 1967 with Tim Brooke-Taylor, Graham Chapman and Marty Feldman, and was co-writer with Graham Chapman of several episodes of the &quot;Doctor in the House&quot; television comedy series. In later series, Cleese was often absent, due to his appearances in &quot;Monty Python&quot;; in the sleeve notes to the BBC&#x27;s re-issues of the shows on cassette, his absences were explained as &quot;[having] ranting commitments elsewhere&quot;.
*Graeme Garden (also one of the three members of The Goodies). A qualified medical doctor, Garden was co-writer with Bill Oddie of several episodes of the medical comedy &quot;Doctor in the House&quot; on ITV (appearing in the episode &quot;Doctor on the Box&quot; as a television presenter). He also appeared as Commander Forrest in the &quot;Yes Minister&quot; television episode &quot;The Death List&quot;. He was a member of &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry, I&#x27;ll Read That Again&quot; from the start. At the same time, he was studying medicine in London. Because he did a midwifery medical course in Plymouth, he was unable to be a member of the cast of &quot;ISIRTA&quot; during the third series, due to the distance between London and Plymouth which made commuting to record the shows impossible. However, Graeme kept sending scripts for the radio show by mail - and rejoined the cast upon his return to his medical studies in London.
*David Hatch (who was appointed to executive positions within the BBC, including Controller of BBC Radio 4), as was common in BBC radio at that time, served both as the show&#x27;s announcer and as a cast member (similar to Douglas Smith&#x27;s role in &quot;Round the Horne&quot;; Hatch however did give his roles some characterisation, in contrast to Smith&#x27;s totally deadpan style). Hatch&#x27;s announcements were frequently lampooned or interrupted by other cast members. In the 25th Anniversary special, Hatch invited the audience to join them again in 25 years time - ironically, by 2014 Hatch, who died in 2007, was the only cast member to have died.
*Jo Kendall (a radio actress in many straight dramas subsequently; also appeared in the radio comedy series &quot;The Burkiss Way&quot;). She also guest starred (as the voice of The Queen) in &quot;The Goodies&quot; 1980 episode &quot;Goodies and Politics&quot;. Kendall died in January 2022.
*Bill Oddie (also one of the three members of The Goodies). He has written many books, and has been an important spokesman on wildlife and ecological issues since the 1980s. Bill Oddie wrote and performed a daft but well-crafted song in the middle of most &quot;ISIRTA&quot; programmes. He was co-writer (with Graeme Garden) of several episodes of the &quot;Doctor in the House&quot; television comedy series.
*Humphrey Barclay was the producer of &quot;ISIRTA&quot; until 1968; from April that year the task was shared by David Hatch and Peter Titherage. In 1973, production was shared by David Hatch with John Cassels (for six episodes) and with Bob Oliver Rogers (for two episodes).
*Music for the links and songs was provided by Dave Lee and his band. In keeping with the tradition of the Goons, the band featured at the end of each show after the (brief) sign-off song, however unlike the Goons there was no regular second spot during the show, furthermore rather than a live performance of a jazz standard, the tune at the end was a recording of them playing an up-tempo jazz piano trio number, composed by Lee specifically to act as a signature tune for the show.

==Influence==
As well as giving rise to The Goodies team, ISIRTA shows the roots of the Monty Python team very clearly, with Cleese, Chapman and Eric Idle all regular script contributors. The show&#x27;s creator Humphrey Barclay went on to create the TV show &quot;Do Not Adjust Your Set&quot;, featuring the rest of the Python team, as well as Idle.

&quot;ISIRTA&quot;″s roots can be traced back to classic radio comedies like &quot;It&#x27;s That Man Again&quot; and &quot;The Goon Show&quot;. As with &quot;Round the Horne&quot;, the cast&#x27;s adventures would sometimes be episodic with cliff-hanger endings each week as with &quot;The Curse of the Flying Wombat&quot; (3rd series), and &quot;Professor Prune And The Electric Time Trousers&quot; (7th series). Christmas specials normally included a spoof of a traditional pantomime (or several combined). They had few qualms about the use of puns – old, strained or inventive – and included some jokes and catchphrases now considered politically incorrect. Garden&#x27;s impressions of the rugby league commentator Eddie Waring and the Scottish TV presenter Fyfe Robertson, Oddie&#x27;s frequent parodies of the game-show host Hughie Green, and Cleese&#x27;s occasional but manic impressions of Patrick Moore (astronomer and broadcaster) also featured.

As the only woman on the show, Jo Kendall voiced all the female characters (with the exception of Brooke-Taylor&#x27;s oversexed harridan, Lady Constance de Coverlet) and occasionally extended into having conversations with herself in different voices. (In one episode of the serial &quot;The Curse of the Flying Wombat&quot;, not only did Kendall play two characters in the same scene but so did Tim Brooke-Taylor, resulting in a four way conversation between the two actors). Kendall also wrote some of her own material.

The show ended with an unchanging sign-off song, which Bill Oddie performed as &quot;Angus Prune&quot; and was referred to by the announcer as &quot;The Angus Prune Tune&quot;. Spoof dramas were billed as Prune Playhouse and many parodies of commercial radio were badged as Radio Prune.

==Repeats and spinoffs==
Several cast members appeared in the radio comedy panel game &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot;, a spinoff from &quot;ISIRTA&quot; that has outlived it by decades. Graeme Garden and Tim Brooke-Taylor continued as regulars on the show.

All series of &quot;ISIRTA&quot; have been rebroadcast on BBC Radio 4 Extra (available on digital television, DAB digital radio and the web), though some episodes (series 8 episode 2, and series 9 episodes 5 &amp; 6) were not transmitted due to potentially offensive content. Infrequently, Australian listeners found &quot;ISIRTA&quot; in the 5.30am vintage comedy timeslot on ABC Radio National (available on the web to overseas listeners). It is not certain of the reasons due to its being pulled off-air, as this slot has now since been replaced with a business program.

The official story of ISIRTA was published in The Clue Bible by Jem Roberts, in 2009.

In 2015, plans were announced for a live &quot;Best Of&quot; homage show, using material by Garden and Oddie reworked by Barnaby Eaton-Jones, Jem Roberts and Dirk Maggs and performed by Hannah Boydell, David Clarke, Barnaby Eaton-Jones, William KV Browne and Ben Perkins. The show was a sell-out success at The Bacon Theatre, Cheltenham in February 2016 and a tour was licensed by Graeme Garden and Bill Oddie to the same company, the Offstage Theatre Group. In February 2017, it was announced that the British tour would take place later in the year, with guest appearances by Garden, Oddie, Taylor and Jo Kendall. In 2019 four new episodes with the slightly modified title &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I&#x27;ll Read That Again... Again&quot; were recorded and broadcast on Radio 4 Extra with some original cast including Tim Brooke Taylor, together with newer performers such as Barnaby Eaton-Jones.

==Catchphrases==

* &quot;I&#x27;m sorry, I&#x27;ll read that again&quot; – a frequent interruption to mock news broadcasts on the show – the line often reads &quot;Here is the news. I&#x27;m sorry, I&#x27;ll read that again: Here &quot;are&quot; the news.&quot;
* &quot;Rhubarb tart?&quot; A delicacy much loved by all the cast members and often used as a bribe during sketches. David Hatch leaves the University of the Air during a Julius Caesar spoof lecture after Bill Oddie&#x27;s flip remarks, only to be coaxed back with offers of rhubarb tart. It is also Angus Prune&#x27;s favourite dish. In the &quot;Ali Baba&quot; sketch in the 3rd series, Cleese appears as Omar Khayyam; he remarks to Ali Baba, played by Brooke-Taylor, &quot;Surely you&#x27;ve heard of the &quot;Rhubarb Tart of Omar Khayyam&quot;?&quot; There were also two &quot;Rhubarb Tart&quot; songs, one sung by Cleese, which he also sang in &quot;At Last the 1948 Show&quot;, and one sung by Oddie, which became &quot;The Custard Pie Song&quot; in the TV series &quot;The Goodies&quot;.
* The Tillingbourne Folk and Madrigal Society. A recurring parody of English &quot;a cappella&quot; folk music (madrigal). The Society performed a range of songs from a medley of football chants through to the never-ending folk song &quot;There was a Ship that put to Sea all in the Month of May.&quot; They also presented a version of &quot;House of the Rising Sun&quot;, with Graeme Garden singing a fairly straight version of the song and the rest of the group providing highly mannered interjections, such as &quot;tiddly-pom&quot; and &quot;whack-fol-riddle-me-o&quot;. Yet, despite the whimsy, it was clear that the cast members were very capable singers.
* &quot;I&#x27;m the king rat!&quot; Generally said very over-dramatically by John Cleese, on which the rest of the cast would reply, &quot;Oh, no you&#x27;re not!&quot; This was later referenced in a Monty Python sketch at a &quot;hospital for over-actors&quot;.
* &quot;The Angus Prune Tune&quot;. Written by Bill Oddie and performed by Bill Oddie (often with considerable audience involvement), this was the sign-off song for the series. In a retrospective show called &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I&#x27;ll Read That Again, Again&quot; broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Extra in March 2013 to celebrate 50 years of &quot;ISIRTA&quot;, Bill Oddie said that the lyrics which were added later had been written by Humphrey Barclay. The full text runs as follows:
*:My name is Angus Prune
*:and I always listen to I&#x27;m Sorry I&#x27;ll Read That Again
*::(You Don&#x27;t!)
*:My name is Angus Prune
*:and I never miss I&#x27;m Sorry I&#x27;ll Read That Again
*::(Get Away!)
*:I sit in my bath
*:And I have a good laugh
*:Cause the sig tune is named after me
*::(Tell us yer name!)
*:My name is Angus Prune
*:And this is my tune
*:It goes I-S-I-R-T-A
*:I&#x27;m Sorry I&#x27;ll Read That AGAIN!&#x27;
* Beethoven&#x27;s Fifth. The opening bars of the symphony are constantly used in the series, usually in inappropriate settings; their first appearance was in the first sketch of the pilot programme in 1963, and during an &quot;Opportunity Knocks&quot; spoof in the 3rd series Bill Oddie tries to tap-dance to them in what sound like hob-nailed boots. David Hatch once introduced the cast: &quot;with another of their sallies forth – (GRAMS: &#x27;Da-da-da-dummmmm&#x27;) – or Beethoven&#x27;s Fifth –&quot; On another occasion, the pre-show teaser was Beethoven, played by Brooke-Taylor, trying to get Bill Oddie, playing a stereotypically Jewish-sounding music publisher, to market the tune. After hearing the tune, Oddie says: &quot;That&#x27;s a load of old rubbish!&quot; and then twists the melody to form the opening sig. The closing bars of the final movement of the symphony were used to introduce a &#x27;promenade concert&#x27; that featured &quot;There was a Ship that put to Sea all in the Month of May&quot; – Hatch says solemnly in his best BBC voice: &quot;That was the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra under Wilhelm Furtwängler. Now, while they&#x27;re getting up ...&quot;
* &quot;The Ferret Song&quot;. John Cleese has an obsession with ferrets throughout the show, including his performance of &quot;The Ferret Song&quot;. This song begins with the line &quot;I&#x27;ve got a ferret sticking up my nose.&quot; The line is repeated, then: &quot;How it got there I can&#x27;t tell, but now it&#x27;s there, it hurts like hell and, what is more, it radically affects my sense of smell,&quot; – and promptly gets even worse. The song, written by John Cleese and Graham Chapman, was included in &quot;The Fairly Incomplete and Rather Badly Illustrated Monty Python Song Book&quot;, accompanied by a picture of Cleese with a Terry Jones-shaped ferret up his nose.
* The Silly Roll Call. During many of the longer adventures, the cast engage in the Silly Roll Call, where a series of words (sometimes appropriate to their adventure) are turned into people&#x27;s names in the vein of an inverted knock-knock joke. The &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot; story involves criminals such as &quot;Mr. and Mrs. Ree ... and their son ... Robby Ree ... and his cousin from the Far East, Ahmed Robby Ree; Mr. and Mrs. Nee, their Swedish son Lars Nee .. and his sister Betty Lars Nee; and Mr. and Mrs. Sittingforimmoralpurposes...and their son...Solly Sittingforimmoralpurposes&quot;. In &quot;Jorrocks&quot;, the Hunt Ball features appearances by &quot;Lord and Lady V&#x27;syouyeahyeahyeah and their daughter Sheila V&#x27;syouyeahyeahyeah&quot; as well as &quot;Lord and Lady Umeeroffen and their son Duke Umeeroffen&quot;. Even the Ancient Greek world of Oedipus is not sacred – Socrates appears with Knobblyknees, Euripides with Iripadose, Antigone and Uncle-igone, and the treble of Aristophanes, Hoiteetoitees and Afternoonteas (as well as a barrage of rotten fruit). The idea of the Silly Roll Call was revived in &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot;, the final game of the show often being some variant of the &quot;Late Arrivals (at a society ball)&quot; where the same sort of &quot;silly names&quot; would be announced by each of the players in turn.
* The Gibbon. Often when a generic animal is required for a sketch, the team used a gibbon. Every mention of the gibbon usually raises cheers from the audience. This is often expanded to ludicrous lengths, such as a &quot;Gibbon-Fanciers&#x27; Club&quot;. Edward Gibbon&#x27;s work &quot;Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot; is rendered as &quot;&quot;Decline and Fall of the Roman Gibbon&quot;, by Edward Empire&quot;. Stanley Gibbons&#x27; Stamp Catalogue became known as &quot;Stanley Stamps&#x27; Gibbon Catalogue&quot;. Later, The Goodies, Brooke-Taylor, Garden, and Oddie had a 1975 Top Ten hit with &quot;Funky Gibbon&quot;, which reached #4, and they sang live on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, and the Amnesty International show &quot;A Poke in the Eye (With a Sharp Stick)&quot;, and during &quot;The Goodies&quot; episode &quot;The Goodies – Almost Live&quot;. In &quot;The Goodies&quot; episode &quot;That Old Black Magic&quot;, Graeme Garden acts like an ape to the accompaniment of the Bill Oddie song &quot;Stuff The Gibbon&quot; — and in another &quot;Goodies&quot; episode, &quot;Radio Goodies&quot;, the small boat above their pirate radio submarine is called &quot;The Saucy Gibbon&quot;. A track on Soft Machine&#x27;s &quot;Six&quot; album entitled &quot;Stanley Stamp&#x27;s Gibbon Album&quot; is dedicated to Bill Oddie.
* The Aardvark is another animal mentioned frequently, sometimes in connection with puns such as &quot;How to make your aardvark soft again&quot; or gibberish &quot;Welsh&quot; words such as &quot;spotted aardvark pudding&quot;.
* The Terrapin, which appears occasionally. In one show, after a particularly macabre John Cleese monologue, Hatch sends him packing, whereupon the rest of the cast defect with Cleese and form Radio Terrapin in competition to Radio Prune. In another show, Bill performs &quot;The Terrapin Song&quot;, and on another show, Hatch announces a terrapin joke, as follows: (Garden) &quot;Who was that Terrapin I saw you with last night?&quot; (Brooke-Taylor) &quot;That was no terrapin, that was our old school mistress – she tortoise (taught us).&quot;
* Bill Oddie&#x27;s accent. Having a Birmingham accent (although born in Rochdale in Lancashire, he grew up in Birmingham) made Oddie the butt of many jokes, as well as leading him naturally towards many roles in sketches where someone was required to speak incomprehensibly. He got his own back in the &quot;Lawrence Of Arabia On Ice&quot; sketch, when he appeared as Nanook of the North, complete with a plethora of cod-Lancastrian patois (&quot;ee bah goom&quot;, &quot;black puddings&quot;, &quot;ecky thump&quot;, etc.) This became the basis for an episode of &quot;The Goodies&quot; where &quot;Ecky Thump&quot; was a secret Lancastrian martial art, the episode parodying the then-popular TV show &quot;Kung Fu&quot;.
* The Old Jokes Home. The old jokes, of which there were many (see script below) were sometimes sent to the Old Jokes Home.
* &#x27;Spot&#x27;. References to &quot;a spot of brandy&quot;, &quot;my favourite spot&quot;, etc., were usually followed by a canine yelp from Bill Oddie, attributed to &quot;Spot the Dog&quot;. Spot became an audience favourite, and made at least one appearance in each episode.
* OBE. Characters often have OBE added to the end of their name. It is also added to places, objects and names, as well as an interruption, e.g. in &quot;The Angus Prune (OBE) Song&quot;. The cast occasionally ask for one (&quot;Thank you ma&#x27;am, I&#x27;ll take the OBE if it&#x27;s offered&quot;) or decline one that&#x27;s been offered (&quot;No thanks, I&#x27;m trying to give them up&quot;). On one occasion, Hatch introduced the team as &quot;Tim Brooke-Taylor, O.B.E., John Cleese, O.B.E., Graeme Garden, O.B.E., David Hatch, O.B.E., Jo Kendall, O.B.E., and Bill Oddie, O.D.D.I.E.&quot; On another occasion, in a send-up of the Honours List, Hatch announces that a particular person has been made an earl, and also has been awarded the OBE; he therefore becomes an earlobe (this joke was also used in &quot;The Goodies&quot; series seven episode &quot;Royal Command&quot;).
*: David Hatch was appointed a CBE in 1994 and was knighted in 2003, Bill Oddie was awarded the OBE also in 2003, Tim Brooke-Taylor and Graeme Garden were appointed OBE in 2011, but John Cleese declined a CBE in 1996. Jo Kendall did not receive any honour.

==Episode and sketch titles==
The episode titles (for shows from series 3 onwards) are unofficial and mostly come from the last sketch in each episode, which usually took the form of a short play. Figures in parentheses after each title are the Series and Episode numbers, where known. For example, &#x27;(S9E7)&#x27; refers to Series 9 Episode 7.
==Regular characters of the radio show==
;The Director-General of the BBC
: played by John Cleese. Continually sends memos to the &quot;ISIRTA&quot; team with the most ridiculous requests. One week, he decides that &quot;Radio Prune&quot; will become a music channel, a rival to Radio 1. His reason is &quot;We at the BBC may be very, very silly, but we can write letters&quot;. He is constantly offended by the contents of the show.
;North American Continuity Man
: is a parody of Hughie Green usually played by Oddie, although on one occasion, in the 3rd series, he is voiced by Garden. His catchphrases include &quot;Thank-you, Thank-you&quot; and &quot;Wasn&#x27;t that just great?&quot; Invariably, when he hands over to Kendall for details of the Prune Play of the Week, she refers to him by another personality&#x27;s name – Simon (Dee), Jimmy (Young, or possibly Savile), David (Frost), or Eamonn (Andrews). On one occasion, after Kendall announces the title of the Prune Play of the Week &quot;Jorrocks: The Memoirs of a Fox-Hunting Man&quot; (or a man-hunting fox...), by Stanley Stamps, author of Stanley Stamps&#x27; Gibbon catalogue, Bill/Hughie says to the audience, &quot;So will you please put your hands together ... and pray ...&quot;
;Angus Prune
: is a character adopted by Bill Oddie to sing the playoff.
;Grimbling
:A Bill Oddie character, Grimbling is a &quot;dirty old man&quot; who often appears as a groundsman, butler, or some similar profession. Due to the limitations of an audio-only medium, the true nature of Grimbling is never revealed, but he is greeted with universal revulsion by all bar the audience. He memorably introduces himself in the 25th anniversary episode &quot;I am Grimbling, but don&#x27;t worry, I&#x27;ll clean it up later.&quot; In the same episode, Cleese asks him &quot;Aren&#x27;t you a little past it, old man?&quot; with the response, &quot;No, I&#x27;m a little dirty old man&quot;. In the &quot;Robin Hood&quot; sketch in the 3rd series, Grimbling is in the employ of the Sheriff of Nottingham (Garden), who tells him, &quot;You have done well, Grimbling; take this tennis racquet for your services&quot;.
;Lady Constance de Coverlet
: is a ridiculous female character who was played by Tim Brooke-Taylor. Once the character had become more established, Lady Constance was usually introduced by a statement along the lines of &quot;what is that coming towards us? – It&#x27;s huge – It&#x27;s a rhinoceros!&quot; – &quot;No, it&#x27;s me!!!&quot; and this was often accompanied by a rousing rendition of &quot;Happy Days Are Here Again&quot;, and a thunderous reception from the audience. Her size is legendary; in the &quot;Henry VIII&quot; sketch, Katharine of Aragon and Lady Constance (masquerading as Anne of Cleavage) fight a duel to decide who is to be Queen. Brooke-Taylor introduces her in the style of a boxing MC: &quot;..and in the blue corner, at 15 hundredweight, your own, your very own – and there&#x27;s enough to go round – twice -...&quot;. In the &quot;Dentisti&quot; sketch, a parody on the 1960s TV series &quot;Daktari&quot;, Lady Constance plays (appropriately) an elephant; and in &quot;Jack The Ripper&quot;, Lady Constance is invited to: &quot;please, sit down anywhere ... or in your case, everywhere&quot;. In the &quot;Radio Prune Greek Tragedy&quot; sketch, she plays the mother of Oedipus Rex – according to the Oracle, she was hoping for a dog – and she tells Oedipus: &quot;Now let me get on with my housework, I&#x27;ve got a little behind ..&quot; (pause for the &quot;double-entendre&quot; to register) &quot;.. oh all right, I&#x27;ve got a colossal behind!!&quot; In the &quot;Colditz&quot; sketch, the lads&#x27; escape route is through the plug hole of her bath, and Bill Oddie exclaims &quot;She&#x27;s like a ruddy great iceberg: one eighth above the water, 76 eighths below!&quot;. She also in her own way is a bit of a nymphomaniac – she&#x27;s described in the 25th anniversary show version of &quot;Jack The Ripper&quot; as a steaming volcano of eroticism – and there are frequent references to unfulfilled sexual desire: in the &quot;3.17 to Cleethorpes&quot; sketch, she and the other players in the drama are adrift on a raft in the ocean; Lady Constance offers to take all her clothes off and use them for a sail, and when Hatch says, &quot;Yes, and then what?&quot;, Lady Constance replies, &quot;Well, that&#x27;s rather up to you ...&quot;
;Mr Arnold Totteridge
:Another recurring character, Arnold Totteridge (played by Garden) is a doddering old man who gets lost in the middle of his sentences. He invariably begins with: &quot;How do you do, do you do, do you do...do you?&quot; and after rambling incoherently for a few minutes returns to where he started. In the 25th anniversary episode, he has been appointed &quot;The Dynamic new-de-oo-do-de-oo-do-de-oo Head of Radio-do-do-de-do Comedy&quot;
;John and Mary
: John Cleese and Jo Kendall frequently performed poignant – almost romantic – dialogues as the respectable but dysfunctional couple &quot;John and Mary&quot;, a forerunner of the relationship between Basil and Sybil in &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot;. They bear a passing resemblance to Fiona and Charles of &quot;Round the Horne&quot;.
;Masher Wilkins
:A kind-hearted simpleton (played by John Cleese), who often appears as an unlikely villain or henchman. He is prone to malapropisms: &quot;I&#x27;ve been trailing you through this impenetrable ferret-- I mean &#x27;forest&#x27;&quot; - but these are often the intro to clever running jokes - in this case the line continues: &quot;Oh no, not ferret, I mean stoat&quot;. &quot;Stoat?&quot; &quot;Yes, &#x27;stoatally impenetrable&quot;. At some point, a female character would often call out &quot;Oh, Masher, Masher!&quot; - followed by a chorus of &quot;All fall down!&quot; by the remaining cast. In one show, the topic on &quot;The Money Programme&quot; is fiscal policy and other matters monetary, and Masher asks some very abstruse questions about the Bank of England and its role in the economy. His last question, however is: &#x27;An&#x27; wot&#x27;s the combination o&#x27; de safe: oooh wot a giveaway!!&#x27;

Another compilation was released by BBC Records in 1978, reissued on CD in 2011 as part of the Vintage Beeb range.

Four volumes of compilation cassettes were released by the BBC Radio Collection between 1989 and 1997 containing complete episodes. These were re-released on CD in 2007 alongside a fifth volume.

A tie-in book of sketches was published by Javelin in 1985, illustrated by Graeme Garden.

==Notes==
&quot;ISIRTA&quot; is referenced in &quot;The Goodies&quot;″s episode &quot;Chubbie Chumps&quot;, where the initials are printed on the wall in chalk.

&quot;Spot the dog&quot; is referenced in &quot;The Goodies&quot;″s episode &quot;Camelot&quot; as the royal dog &quot;Spot&quot;, where it received an immediate cheer.

In the computer game , there is a magic spell called Kendall, found just before a reference to a magic plane shared with people who own ferrets.

<text>A transcontinental railroad or transcontinental railway is contiguous railroad trackage that crosses a continental land mass and has terminals at different oceans or continental borders. Such networks may be via the tracks of a single railroad, or via several railroads owned or controlled by multiple railway companies along a continuous route. Although Europe is crisscrossed by railways, the railroads within Europe are usually not considered transcontinental, with the possible exception of the historic Orient Express.
Transcontinental railroads helped open up interior regions of continents not previously colonized to exploration and settlement that would not otherwise have been feasible. In many cases, they also formed the backbones of cross-country passenger and freight transportation networks. Many of them continue to have an important role in freight transportation, and some such as the Trans-Siberian Railway even have passenger trains going from one end to the other.

==Africa==

===East-west===
* There are several ways to cross Africa transcontinentally via connecting east–west railways. One is the Benguela railway, completed in 1929. It starts in Lobito, Angola, and connects through Katanga to the Zambia railways system. From Zambia several ports are accessible on the Indian Ocean: Dar es Salaam in Tanzania through the TAZARA, and, through Zimbabwe, Beira and Maputo in Mozambique. The Angolan Civil War has made the Benguela line largely inoperative, but efforts are being taken to restore it. Another west–east corridor leads from the Atlantic harbours in Namibia, either Walvis Bay or Luderitz to the South African rail system that, in turn, links to ports on the Indian Ocean ( i.e. Durban, Maputo).
* A 1015 km gap in the east–west line between Kinshasa and Ilebo filled by riverboats could be plugged with a new railway.
* There are two proposals for a line from the Red Sea to the Gulf of Guinea, including TransAfricaRail.
* In 2010, a proposal sought to link Dakar to Port Sudan. Thirteen countries would be on the main route; another six would be served by branches.

===North-south===
* A north-south transcontinental railway had been proposed by Cecil Rhodes, who termed it the Cape-Cairo railway. This system would act as a direct route from the northernmost British possession in Africa, Egypt, to the southernmost one, the Cape Colony. The project was never completed. During its development, a competing French colonial project for a competing line from Algiers or Dakar to Abidjan was abandoned after the Fashoda incident. This line would have had four gauge islands in three gauges. 
* An extension of Namibian Railways is being built in 2006 with the possible connection to Angolan Railways.
* Libya has proposed a Trans-Saharan Railway connecting possibly to Nigeria which would connect with the proposed AfricaRail network.

===African Union of Railways===
* The African Union of Railways has plans to connect the various railways of Africa including the Dakar-Port Sudan Railway.

==Australia==

===East-west===
*Australia&#x27;s east–west transcontinental rail corridor, consisting of lines built to three different track gauges, was completed in 1917, when the Trans-Australian Railway was opened between Port Augusta, South Australia and Kalgoorlie, Western Australia. This line, built by the federal government as a federation commitment, filled the last gap in the lines between the mainland state capitals of Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth. Passengers and freight alike suffered from time-consuming breaks of gauge: a Perth–Brisbane journey at that time involved two standard gauge 1435 mm (4 ft 8 in) lines, a broad gauge 1600 mm (5 ft 3 in) line, and three of 1067 mm (3 ft 6 in) gauge.
*In the 1940s and 1960s, steps were taken to progressively reduce the huge inefficiencies caused by the numerous historically imposed breaks of gauge by linking the mainland capital cities with lines all of standard gauge.
*In 1970, the route across the continent was completed to standard gauge and a new, all-through passenger train, the &quot;Indian Pacific&quot; was inaugurated.
*An east–west transcontinental line across northern Australia from the Pilbara to the east coast – more than 1000 km (600 mi) north of the Sydney-Perth rail corridor – was proposed in 2006 by Project Iron Boomerang to connect iron ore mining in the Pilbara and coal mining in the Bowen Basin in Queensland, with steel manufacturing plants at both ends.

===North–south===

* Australia&#x27;s north–south transcontinental rail corridor was built in stages during the 20th century, leaving a gap to be finished after the Tarcoola to Alice Springs section was completed in 1980. That final section, from Alice Springs to Darwin, was opened in 2004. The total length of the corridor, from Adelaide to Darwin, is . Completion of the corridor ended 126 years of freight and passengers alike having to be transferred between trains on tracks of different gauges: the corridor is now entirely 1435 mm (4 ft 8 in) standard gauge. The corridor is an important route for freight. An upmarket experiential tourism passenger train, &quot;The Ghan&quot;, operated by Journey Beyond, makes the journey once a week in each direction from Adelaide to Darwin, and the company&#x27;s east–west &quot;Indian Pacific&quot; runs on the southernmost before heading west to Perth. There is no intermediate passenger traffic on the line. 
* In 2018, the Australian Rail Track Corporation started building a standard gauge fast-freight railway from Melbourne to Brisbane, known as the Inland Railway. , completion was anticipated in 2027.

==Eurasia==
=== Europe ===

* The first transcontinental railroad in Europe, that connected the North Sea or the English Channel with the Mediterranean Sea, was a series of lines that included the Paris–Marseille railway, in service 1856. Multiple railways north of Paris were in operation at that time, such as Paris–Lille railway and Paris–Le Havre railway.
* The second connection between the seas of Northern Europe and the Mediterranean Sea, was a series of lines finalized in 1857 with the Austrian Southern Railway, Vienna–Trieste. There were before that railroad connections Hamburg–Berlin–Wrocław–Vienna (including Berlin–Hamburg Railway, Berlin–Wrocław railway, Upper Silesian Railway and Emperor Ferdinand Northern Railway). The Baltic Sea was also connected through the Lübeck–Lüneburg railway.

=== Trans-Eurasia ===
*The Trans-Siberian Railway, completed in 1905, was the first network of railways connecting Europe and Asia. It connects Western Russia to the Russian Far East, and is the longest railway line in the world, with a length of over . The railway starts from Russia&#x27;s capital Moscow, which is the largest city in Europe, and ends at Vladivostok, on the coast of the Pacific Ocean. Expansion of the railway system continues , with connecting rails going into Asia, namely Mongolia, China and North Korea. There are also plans to connect Tokyo, the capital of Japan, to the railway.
* A second rail line connects Istanbul in Turkey with China via Iran, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. This route imposes a break of gauge at the Iranian border with Turkmenistan and at the Chinese border. En route there is a train ferry in eastern Turkey across Lake Van. The European and Asian parts of Istanbul was linked 2019 linked by the Marmaray undersea tunnel, before that by train ferry. There is no through service of passenger trains on the entire line. A uniform gauge connection was proposed in 2006, commencing with new construction in Kazakhstan. A decision to make the internal railways of Afghanistan gauge potentially opens up a new standard gauge route to China, since China abuts this country.
* The Trans-Asian Railway is a project to link Singapore to Istanbul and is to a large degree complete with missing pieces primarily in Myanmar. The project has also linking corridors to China, the central Asian states, and Russia. This transcontinental line unfortunately uses a number of different gauges, , , and , though this problem may be lessened with the use of variable gauge axle systems such as the SUW 2000.
* The TransKazakhstan Trunk Railways project by Kazakhstan Temir Zholy will connect China and Europe with standard gauge . Construction is set to start in 2006. Initially the line will go to western Kazakhstan, south through Turkmenistan to Iran, then to Turkey and Europe. A shorter to-be-constructed link from Kazakhstan is considered going through Russia and either Belarus or Ukraine.
* The Baghdad Railway connects Istanbul with Baghdad and finally Basra, a sea port at the Persian Gulf. When its construction started in the 1880s it was in those times a Transcontinental Railroad. 

==North America==
===United States===

A transcontinental railroad in the United States is any continuous rail line connecting a location on the U.S. Pacific coast with one or more of the railroads of the nation&#x27;s eastern trunk line rail systems operating between the Missouri or Mississippi Rivers and the U.S. Atlantic coast. The first concrete plan for a transcontinental railroad in the United States was presented to Congress by Asa Whitney in 1845.

A series of transcontinental railroads built over the last third of the 19th century created a nationwide transportation network that united the country by rail. The first of these, the &quot;Pacific Railroad&quot;, was built by the Central Pacific Railroad and Union Pacific Railroad, as well as the Western Pacific Railroad (1862-1870), to link the San Francisco Bay at Alameda, California, with the nation&#x27;s existing eastern railroad network at Omaha, Nebraska/Council Bluffs, Iowa — thereby creating the world&#x27;s second transcontinental railroad when it was completed from Omaha to Alameda on September 6, 1869. (The first transcontinental railroad was the Panama Railroad of 1855.) Its construction was made possible by the US government under Pacific Railroad Acts of 1862, 1864, and 1867. Its original course was very close to current Interstate 80.

====Transcontinental railroad====

The United States&#x27; first transcontinental railroad was built between 1863 and 1869 that connected the existing eastern U.S. rail network at Council Bluffs, Iowa, with the Pacific coast at the Oakland Long Wharf on San Francisco Bay. Its construction was considered to be one of the greatest American technological feats of the 19th century. Known as the &quot;Pacific Railroad&quot; when it opened, it served as a vital link for trade, commerce, and travel and opened up vast regions of the North American heartland for settlement. Much of the original route, especially on the Sierra grade west of Reno, Nevada, is currently used by Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;California Zephyr&quot;, although many parts have been rerouted.

The resulting coast-to-coast railroad connection revolutionized the settlement and economy of the American West. It brought the western states and territories into alignment with the northern Union states and made transporting passengers and goods coast-to-coast considerably quicker, safer and less expensive. It replaced most of the far slower and more hazardous stagecoach lines and wagon trains. The number of emigrants taking the Oregon and California Trails declined dramatically. The sale of the railroad land grant lands and the transport provided for timber and crops led to the rapid settling of the &quot;Great American Desert&quot;.

The Union Pacific recruited laborers from Army veterans and Irish immigrants, while most of the engineers were ex-Army men who had learned their trade keeping the trains running during the American Civil War.

The Central Pacific Railroad faced a labor shortage in the more sparsely settled West. It recruited Cantonese laborers in China, who built the line over and through the Sierra Nevada mountains and then across Nevada to their meeting in northern Utah. Chinese workers made up ninety percent of the workforce on the line. The Chinese Labor Strike of 1867 was peaceful, with no violence, organized across the entire Sierra Nevada route, and was carried out according to a peaceful Confucian model of protest. The strike began with the Summer Solstice in June, 1867 and lasted for eight days.

====Land Grants====
The Transcontinental Railroad required land and a complex federal policy for purchasing, granting, conveying land. 
Some of these land-related acts included:

* One motive for the Gadsden Purchase of land from Mexico in 1853 was to obtain suitable terrain for a southern transcontinental railroad, as the southern portion of the Mexican Cession was too mountainous. The Southern Pacific Railroad was completed in 1881.
* The Pacific Railroad Act of 1862 (based on an earlier bill in 1856) authorized land grants for new lines that would &quot;aid in the construction of a railroad and telegraph line from the Missouri river to the Pacific ocean&quot;.
* The rails of the &quot;first transcontinental railroad&quot; were joined on May 10, 1869, with the ceremonial driving of the &quot;Last Spike&quot; at Promontory Summit, Utah, after track was laid over a gap between Sacramento and Omaha, Nebraska/Council Bluffs, Iowa in six years by the Union Pacific Railroad and Central Pacific Railroad. Although through train service between Omaha and Sacramento was in operation as of that date, the road was not completed to the Pacific Ocean until September 6, 1869, when the first through train reached San Francisco Bay at Alameda Terminal, and on November 8, 1869, when it reached the terminus at Oakland Long Wharf. Later, November 6, 1869, was deemed to be the official completion date of the Pacific Railroad. (A physical connection between Omaha, Nebraska, and the &quot;statutory&quot; Eastern terminus of the Pacific road at Council Bluffs, Iowa, located immediately across the Missouri River was also not finally established until the opening of UPRR railroad bridge across the river on March 25, 1873, prior to which transfers were made by ferry operated by the Council Bluffs &amp; Nebraska Ferry Company.)
* The first permanent, continuous line of railroad track from coast to coast was completed 15 months later on August 15, 1870, by the Kansas Pacific Railroad near its crossing of Comanche Creek at Strasburg, Colorado. This route connected to the eastern rail network via the Hannibal Bridge across the Missouri River at Kansas City completed June 30, 1869, passed through Denver, Colorado, and north to the Union Pacific Railroad at Cheyenne, Wyoming, making it theoretically possible for the first time to board a train at Jersey City, New Jersey, travel entirely by rail, and step down at the Alameda Wharf on San Francisco Bay in Oakland. This singularity existed until March 25, 1873 when the Union Pacific constructed the Missouri River Bridge in Omaha.

====Subsequent transcontinental routes====

* Almost 12 years after Promontory Summit, the Southern Pacific Railroad (SP) constructed the second transcontinental railroad, building eastwards through the Gadsden Purchase, which had been acquired from Mexico in 1854 largely with the intention of providing a route for a railroad connecting California with the Southern states. This line was completed with milestones and ceremonies in 1881 and 1883:
** March 8, 1881: the SP met the Rio Grande, Mexico and Pacific Railroad (a subsidiary of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway) with a &quot;silver spike&quot; ceremony at Deming, New Mexico, connecting Atchison, Kansas, to Los Angeles.
** December 15, 1881: the SP met the Texas and Pacific Railway (T&amp;P) at Sierra Blanca, Texas, connecting eastern Texas to Los Angeles.
** January 12, 1883: the SP completed its own southern section, meeting its subsidiary Galveston, Harrisburg and San Antonio Railway at the Pecos River in Texas, and linking New Orleans to Los Angeles.
* In Colorado, the 3-foot gauge Denver &amp; Rio Grande (D&amp;RG) extended its route from Denver via Pueblo across the Rocky Mountains to Grand Junction in 1882. In central Utah, the D&amp;RG acquired a number of independent narrow gauge companies, which were incorporated into the first (1881-1889) Denver and Rio Grande Western Railway (D&amp;RGW). Tracks were extended north through Salt Lake City, while simultaneously building south and eastward toward Grand Junction. The D&amp;RG and the D&amp;RGW were linked on March 30, 1883, the extension to Ogden (where it met the Central Pacific) was completed on May 14, 1883, and through traffic between Denver and Ogden began a few days later. The break of gauge made direct interchange of rolling stock with standard gauge railroads at both ends of this bridge line impossible for several years. The D&amp;RG in 1887 began rebuilding its mainline in standard gauge, including a new route and tunnel at Tennessee Pass. The first D&amp;RGW was reincorporated as the Rio Grande Western (RGW) in June 1889 and immediately began the conversion of track gauge. Standard gauge operations linking Ogden and Denver were completed on November 15, 1890.
* The Atlantic and Pacific Railroad completed its route connecting the AT&amp;SF at Albuquerque, New Mexico, via Flagstaff, Arizona, to the Southern Pacific at Needles, California, on August 9, 1883. The SP line into Barstow was leased by the A&amp;P in 1884 (and purchased in 1911); this gave the AT&amp;SF (the A&amp;P&#x27;s parent company) a direct route into Southern California. This route now forms the western portion of BNSF&#x27;s Southern Transcon.
* The Northern Pacific Railway (NP) completed the fifth independent transcontinental railroad on August 22, 1883, linking Chicago with Seattle. The Completion Ceremony was held on September 8, 1883, with former U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant contributing to driving the Final Spike.
* The California Southern Railroad (chartered January 10, 1882) was completed from National City on San Diego Bay via Temecula Cañon to Colton and San Bernardino in September, 1883, and extended through the Cajon Pass to Barstow, a junction of the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad, in November, 1885. In September, 1885, the line of the Southern Pacific from Colton to Los Angeles, a distance of , had been leased by the California Central with equal rights and privileges thus allowing the Santa Fe&#x27;s Transcontinental route to be completed by the connection with the California Southern and A&amp;PRR. The SP grade was used until the completion of the California Central&#x27;s own line between San Bernardino and Los Angeles in June, 1887, a distance of , which was part of the old Los Angeles and San Gabriel Valley Railroad, which had been acquired by purchase. In August, 1888, the California Central completed its Coast Division south from Los Angeles to a junction with the California Southern Railroad near Oceanside, a distance of , and these two divisions comprised the main line of the California Central, forming, in connection with the California Southern, a direct line between Southern California and the East by way of the Atlantic and Pacific and Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railroads.
* The Great Northern Railway was built, without federal aid, by James J. Hill in 1893; it stretched from St. Paul to Seattle.
* The Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific reached Santa Rosa, New Mexico, from the east in late 1901, shortly before the El Paso &amp; Northeastern arrived from the southwest. The two were connected on February 1, 1902, thus forming an additional link between the Midwest and southern California. Through passenger service was provided by the &quot;Golden State Limited&quot; (Chicago—Kansas City—Tucumcari—El Paso—Los Angeles) jointly operated by the Rock Island and the Southern Pacific (EP&amp;NE&#x27;s successor) from 1902 to 1968.
* The San Pedro, Los Angeles &amp; Salt Lake Railroad completed its line connecting Los Angeles through Las Vegas to Salt Lake City on May 1, 1905. Through passenger service from Chicago to Los Angeles was provided by Union Pacific&#x27;s &quot;Los Angeles Limited&quot; from 1905 to 1954, and the &quot;City of Los Angeles&quot; from 1936 to 1971.
* The Western Pacific Railway (WP), financed by the Denver &amp; Rio Grande on behalf of the Gould System, completed its new line (the Feather River Route) from Oakland to Ogden in 1909, in direct competition with the Southern Pacific&#x27;s existing route. Through passenger service (Oakland-Salt Lake City-Denver-Chicago) was provided by the &quot;Exposition Flyer&quot; 1939 to 1949 and its successor, the &quot;California Zephyr&quot; 1949 to 1970, both jointly operated by the WP, the D&amp;RGW and the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy.
* In 1909, the Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul (or Milwaukee Road) completed a privately built Pacific extension to Seattle. On completion, the line was renamed the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific. Although the Pacific Extension was privately funded, predecessor roads did benefit from the federal land grant act, so it cannot be said to have been built without federal aid.
* John D. Spreckels completed his privately funded San Diego and Arizona Railway in 1919, thereby creating a direct link (via connection with the Southern Pacific lines) between San Diego, California and the Eastern United States. The railroad stretched from San Diego to Calexico, California, of which were south of the border in Mexico.
* In 1993, Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Sunset Limited&quot; daily railroad train was extended eastward to Miami, Florida, later rerouted to Orlando, making it the first regularly scheduled transcontinental passenger train route in the United States to be operated by a single company. Hurricane Katrina cut this rail route in Louisiana in 2005. The train now runs from Los Angeles to New Orleans.
* For a time in 1997 and 1998, Amtrak effectively operated the Washington-Chicago &quot;Capitol Limited&quot; and Chicago-Los Angeles &quot;Southwest Chief&quot; as a single train.

====The Gould System====
George J. Gould attempted to assemble a truly transcontinental system in the 1900s. The line from San Francisco, California, to Toledo, Ohio, was completed in 1909, consisting of the Western Pacific Railway, Denver and Rio Grande Railroad, Missouri Pacific Railroad, and Wabash Railroad. Beyond Toledo, the planned route would have used the Wheeling and Lake Erie Railroad (1900), Wabash Pittsburgh Terminal Railway, Little Kanawha Railroad, West Virginia Central and Pittsburgh Railway, Western Maryland Railroad, and Philadelphia and Western Railway, but the Panic of 1907 strangled the plans before the Little Kanawha section in West Virginia could be finished. The Alphabet Route was completed in 1931, providing the portion of this line east of the Mississippi River. With the merging of the railroads, only the Union Pacific Railroad and the BNSF Railway remain to carry the entire route.

===Canada===

The completion of Canada&#x27;s first transcontinental railway with the driving of the Last Spike at Craigellachie, British Columbia, on November 7, 1885, was an important milestone in Canadian history. Between 1881 and 1885, the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) completed a line that spanned from the port of Montreal to the Pacific coast, fulfilling a condition of British Columbia&#x27;s 1871 entry into the Canadian Confederation. The City of Vancouver, incorporated in 1886, was designated the western terminus of the line. The CPR became the first transcontinental railway company in North America in 1889 after its International Railway of Maine opened, connecting CPR to the Atlantic coast.

The construction of a transcontinental railway strengthened the connection of British Columbia and the North-West Territories to the country they had recently joined, and acted as a bulwark against potential incursions by the United States.

Subsequently, two other transcontinental lines were built in Canada: the Canadian Northern Railway (CNoR) opened another line to the Pacific in 1915, and the combined Grand Trunk Pacific Railway (GTPR)/National Transcontinental Railway (NTR) system opened in 1917 following the completion of the Quebec Bridge, although its line to the Pacific opened in 1914. The CNoR, GTPR, and NTR were nationalized to form the Canadian National Railway, which currently is now Canada&#x27;s largest transcontinental railway, with lines running all the way from the Pacific Coast to the Atlantic Coast.

==South and Central America==

There is activity to revive the connection between Valparaíso and Santiago in Chile and Mendoza, Argentina, through the &quot;Transandino&quot; project. Mendoza has an active connection to Buenos Aires. The old Transandino began in 1910 and ceased passenger service in 1978 and freight 4 years later. Technically a complete transcontinental link exists from Arica, Chile, to La Paz, Bolivia, to Buenos Aires, but this trans-Andean crossing is for freight only.

On December 6, 2017 the Brazilian President Michel Temer and his Bolivian counterpart Evo Morales signed an agreement for an Atlantic - Pacific railway. The construction will start in 2019 and will be finished in 2024. The new railway is planned to be 3750 km in length. There are two possible tracks in discussion: Both have an Atlantic end in Santos, Brazil but the Pacific ends are in Ilo and Matarani in Peru.

Another longer Transcontinental freight-only railroad linking Lima, Peru, to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil is under development.

===Panama===
The first railroad to directly connect two oceans (although not by crossing a broad &quot;continental&quot; land mass) was the Panama Canal Railway. Opened in 1855, this line was designated instead as an &quot;inter-oceanic&quot; railroad crossing Country at its narrowest point, the Isthmus of Panama, when that area was still part of Colombia. (Panama split off from Colombia in 1903 and became the independent Republic of Panama). By spanning the isthmus, the line thus became the first railroad to completely cross any part of the Americas and physically connect ports on the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Given the tropical rain forest environment, the terrain, and diseases such as malaria and cholera, its completion was a considerable engineering challenge. The construction took five years after ground was first broken for the line in May, 1850, cost eight million dollars, and required more than seven thousand workers drawn from &quot;every quarter of the globe.&quot;

This railway was built to provide a shorter and more secure path between the United States&#x27; East and West Coasts. This need was mainly triggered by the California Gold Rush. Over the years the railway played a key role in the construction and the subsequent operation of the Panama Canal, due to its proximity to the canal. Currently, the railway operates under the private administration of the Panama Canal Railroad Company, and its upgraded capacity complements the cargo traffic through the Panama Canal.

===Guatemala ===
A second Central American inter-oceanic railroad began operation in 1908 as a connection between Puerto San José and Puerto Barrios in Guatemala, but ceased passenger service to Puerto San José in 1989.

===Costa Rica===
A third Central American inter-oceanic railroad began operation in 1910 as a connection between Puntarenas and Limón in gauge. It currently (2019) sees no passenger service.

<doc id="51917" wikidata="Q2914477" url="?curid=51917" title="Bill Haley &amp; His Comets">
<text>Bill Haley &amp; His Comets were an American rock and roll band formed in 1947 and continuing until Haley&#x27;s death in 1981. The band was also known as Bill Haley and the Comets and Bill Haley&#x27;s Comets. From late 1954 to late 1956, the group recorded nine Top 20 singles, one of which was number one and three that were Top Ten. The single &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; was the best-selling rock single in the history of the genre and maintained that position for several years.

Band leader Bill Haley had previously been a Western swing performer; after recording a rockabilly version of Ike Turner and his Kings of Rhythm&#x27;s &quot;Rocket 88&quot;, one of the first rock and roll recordings, Haley changed his band&#x27;s musical direction to rock music. They went on to record hit versions of &quot;Crazy Man, Crazy&quot;, &quot;Shake, Rattle &amp; Roll&quot;, the aforementioned &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot;, &quot;Dim, Dim the Lights&quot;, &quot;Rock-A-Beatin&#x27; Boogie&quot;, &quot;Razzle-Dazzle&quot;, &quot;See You Later, Alligator&quot;, &quot;The Saints Rock &#x27;N&#x27; Roll&quot; and &quot;Rip It Up&quot;. In 1956, the group appeared in two early rock and roll movies with disc jockey Alan Freed: &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Knock the Rock&quot;.

Though the group was considered to be at the forefront of rock and roll during the genre&#x27;s formative years, the arrival of more risqué acts such as Elvis Presley and Little Richard by 1956 led the more clean-cut Haley and his Comets to decline in popularity. Haley would remain popular in Europe and go on to have a comeback as a nostalgia act in the 1970s, along with many of his contemporaries. Following Haley&#x27;s death, no fewer than seven different groups have existed under the Comets name, all claiming (with varying degrees of authority) to be the continuation of Haley&#x27;s group. As of the end of 2014, four such groups were still performing in the United States and internationally.

==Early history==

In around the mid-1940s, Bill Haley performed with the Down Homers and formed a group called the Four Aces of Western Swing. The group that later became the Comets initially formed as &quot;Bill Haley and the Saddlemen&quot; –1952, and performed mostly country and western songs, though occasionally with a bluesy feel. The group was also the first to record a cover version (in July 1951) of Rocket 88, originally a jump blues song by Jackie Brenston and his Delta Cats, who were actually Ike Turner and his Kings of Rhythm. He did so for the Philadelphia-based Holiday Records label, in what is now recognized as a rockabilly style. It sold well and was followed in 1952 by a cover of a 1940s rhythm and blues song called &quot;Rock the Joint&quot; for Holiday&#x27;s sister company, Essex Records.

During those years however, Haley was considered one of the top cowboy yodelers in America. Many Saddlemen recordings were not released until the 1970s and 1980s, and highlights included romantic ballads such as &quot;Rose of My Heart&quot; and western swing tunes such as &quot;Yodel Your Blues Away.&quot; The original members of this group were Haley, pianist and accordion player Johnny Grande and steel guitarist Billy Williamson. Al Thompson was the group&#x27;s first bass player, followed by Al Rex and Marshall Lytle. During the group&#x27;s early years, it recorded under several other names, including Johnny Clifton and His String Band and Reno Browne and Her Buckaroos (although Browne, a female matinee idol of the time, did not actually appear on the record).

&quot;Rocket 88&quot;, &quot;Rock the Joint&quot;, and their immediate follow-ups were released under the increasingly incongruous Saddlemen name. It soon became apparent that a new name for the group was needed to fit the new musical style. A friend of Haley&#x27;s, making note of the common mispronunciation of the name Halley&#x27;s Comet to rhyme with &quot;Bailey&quot;, suggested that Haley call his band the Comets. This event is cited in the Haley biographies &quot;Sound and Glory&quot; by John Haley and John von Hoelle; &quot;Bill Haley&quot; by John Swenson; and in &quot;Still Rockin&#x27; Around the Clock&quot;, a memoir by Comets bass player Marshall Lytle.

The new name for the group was adopted in the fall of 1952, before the 1953 release of &quot;Crazy Man, Crazy&quot; which had some elements of rock and roll and rockabilly music. Members of the group at that time were Haley, Johnny Grande, Billy Williamson and Marshall Lytle. Grande usually played piano on records but switched to accordion for live shows as it was more portable than a piano and easier to deal with during musical numbers that involved a lot of dancing around. Soon after renaming the band Haley hired his first drummer, Earl Famous. Displeased with the lineup, Haley sought out Dick Boccelli (also known as Dick Richards), who turned down the job but recommended a young drummer Charlie Higler. Soon after, Haley asked Richards again, who then accepted the role. During this time (and as late as the fall of 1955), Haley did not have a permanent lead guitar player, choosing to use session musicians on records and either playing lead guitar himself or having Williamson play steel solos.

Even before the release of more successful records, the group had achieved greatness in some respects: &quot;No one had blended country and R&amp;B on a single before the Comets&#x27; &quot;Rock the Joint&quot;. No one had scored an American Top 20 hit with anything that could really qualify as rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll before their single &quot;Crazy Man Crazy&quot; in 1953&quot;.

==National success and &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot;==

In 1953, Haley scored his first national success with his original song, &quot;Crazy Man, Crazy&quot;, a phrase Haley said he heard from his teenage audience, again released on Essex. Haley later claimed the recording sold a million copies, but this is considered an exaggeration. Some sources indicate that the recording—a blend of R&amp;B, western and pop music—is a contender for the title of &quot;first rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll record&quot; while others state that it was merely &quot;the first rock and roll song to be a hit on the pop charts&quot;. It was also said to be the first rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll recording to be played on national television in the United States (in an episode of Omnibus in 1953).

On their last release from Essex, new band member Joey Ambrose is heard on the B-side, &quot;Straight Jacket.&quot;

In the spring of 1954, Haley and His Comets left Essex for New York-based Decca Records, where they were placed under the auspices of veteran producer Milt Gabler, who would produce all of the band&#x27;s recordings for the label and who had been involved in creating many proto-rock and roll recordings by the likes of the Andrews Sisters and Louis Jordan dating back to the 1940s. One of Jordan&#x27;s records, Saturday Night Fish Fry (1949), is considered to be a contender for the title of &quot;first rock&#x27;n&#x27; roll record. Gabler later commented that &quot;all the tricks I used with Louis Jordan, I used with Bill Haley&quot;.

The group&#x27;s first session, on April 12, 1954, yielded &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot;, which would become Haley&#x27;s biggest hit and one of the most important records in rock and roll history. Sales of &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; started slowly, since it was the B-side of the single, but it performed well enough, that a second Decca session was commissioned.

&quot;Shake, Rattle and Roll&quot; followed, a somewhat bowdlerized cover version of the Big Joe Turner recording released earlier in 1954. The single was one of Decca&#x27;s best-selling records of 1954 and the seventh-best-selling record in November 1954.

In 1954, Anita Gordon starred in &quot;Round Up of Rhythm&quot;, a film short in which she, and Disc Jockey Bill Delzell, played &#x27; Straight Jacket &#x27; and &#x27;Shake Rattle and Roll&#x27;, which the group are seen playing.

In March 1955, the group had four songs in Cash Box magazine&#x27;s top 50 songs: &quot;Dim, Dim the Lights (I Want Some Atmosphere)&quot;; &quot;Birth of the Boogie&quot;; &quot;Mambo Rock&quot;; and &quot;Shake, Rattle and Roll.&quot;

Haley&#x27;s &quot;Shake, Rattle and Roll&quot; never achieved the same level of historical importance as &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; but it predated it as the first international rock and roll hit. It did not attain the Number 1 position on the American charts, but it became Haley&#x27;s first gold record. Elvis Presley recorded the song in 1956, combining Haley&#x27;s arrangement with Turner&#x27;s original lyrics, but his version was not a substantial hit. Late in 1954, Haley recorded another hit, &quot;Dim, Dim The Lights&quot;, which was one of the first R&amp;B songs recorded by a white group to cross over to the R&amp;B charts. Johnnie Ray had reached Number 1 with &quot;Cry&quot; in 1952.

The belated success of &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; is attributed to its use in the soundtrack of the film &quot;Blackboard Jungle,&quot; which was released on March 19, 1955. The song was re-released to coincide with the film and shifted to the single&#x27;s A-side. Haley&#x27;s recording became an anthem for rebellious 1950s youth and reached Number 1 on the pop charts, remaining there for eight weeks, and went to Number 3 on the R&amp;B chart. According to The Guardian, the group was &quot;the first rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll band&quot; and the song was particularly &quot;important because it was the first rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll record heard by millions of people worldwide&quot;.

Ambrose&#x27;s acrobatic saxophone playing, along with Lytle on the double bass – literally on it, riding it like a pony, and holding it over his head – were highlights of the band&#x27;s live performances during this time. Their music and their act were part of a tradition in jazz and rhythm and blues, but it all came like a thunderclap to most of their audience. In late 1954, Haley and His Comets appeared in a short subject entitled &quot;Round Up of Rhythm&quot;, performing three songs. This was the earliest known theatrical rock and roll film release.
In 1955, Lytle, Richards and Ambrose quit the Comets in a salary dispute and formed their own group, the Jodimars. Haley hired several new musicians to take their place: Rudy Pompilli on sax, Al Rex (a former member of the Saddlemen) on double bass, and Ralph Jones on drums. In addition, lead guitarist Franny Beecher, who had been a session musician for Haley since Danny Cedrone&#x27;s death in the spring of 1954, became a full-time Comet and Haley&#x27;s first performing lead guitarist (Cedrone had played the guitar solo on the original recording of &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; and died shortly after the recording session for &quot;Shake, Rattle and Roll&quot; in the summer of 1954). This version of the band became more popular than the earlier manifestation and appeared in several motion pictures over the next few years.

Other hits recorded by the band included &quot;See You Later, Alligator&quot; in which Haley&#x27;s frantic delivery contrasted with the Louisiana languor of the original by Bobby Charles, &quot;Don&#x27;t Knock the Rock&quot;, &quot;Rock-a-Beatin&#x27; Boogie&quot;, &quot;Rudy&#x27;s Rock&quot; (the first instrumental hit of the rock and roll era), and &quot;Skinny Minnie.&quot;

Bill Haley and the Comets performed &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; in an a cappella and a lip-synched version on the NBC television program &quot;Texaco Star Theater&quot; hosted by Milton Berle on May 31, 1955. Berle predicted that the song would go to Number 1, calling the band &quot;A group of entertainers who are going right to the top.&quot; Berle also sang and danced to the song, which was performed by the entire cast of the show. This was one of the earliest nationally televised performances by a rock and roll band and provided the new musical genre a much wider audience.

Bill Haley and the Comets were the first rock and roll performers to appear on the CBS television musical variety program &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show, or Toast of the Town&quot; on Sunday, August 7, 1955, in a broadcast from the Shakespeare Festival Theater in Stratford, Connecticut. They performed a live version of &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; featuring Franny Beecher on lead guitar and Dick Richards on drums. The group made a second and final appearance on the &quot;Ed Sullivan Show&quot; on Sunday, April 28, 1957, performing &quot;Rudy&#x27;s Rock&quot; and &quot;Forty Cups of Coffee.&quot;

Bill Haley and the Comets appeared on &quot;American Bandstand&quot; hosted by Dick Clark on ABC television twice in 1957, on the prime-time show on October 28 and on the regular daytime show on November 27. The band also appeared on Dick Clark&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Beechnut Show&quot; (also known as &quot;The Dick Clark Show&quot;), a prime-time TV series from New York on March 22, 1958, during the first season (performing &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; and &quot;Ooh, Look-a There, Ain&#x27;t She Pretty&quot;) and on February 20, 1960 (performing &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; and &quot;Tamiami&quot;).

In 1956, the group appeared in two of the earliest full-length rock and roll movies with Alan Freed: &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Knock the Rock.&quot; The Platters were co-stars in the first movie, and Little Richard appeared in the second. &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; was produced by Sam Katzman (who would produce several Elvis Presley films in the 1960s) and directed by Fred F. Sears.

==Decline in popularity==
The band&#x27;s popularity in the United States began to wane in 1956–57 as sexier, wilder acts such as Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis and Little Richard began to dominate the record charts (although Haley&#x27;s cover version of Little Richard&#x27;s &quot;Rip It Up&quot;, released in direct competition with Little Richard&#x27;s original recording, outsold the original). After &quot;Skinny Minnie&quot; hit the charts in 1958, Haley had little further success in the United States, although a spin-off group made up of Comets musicians dubbed The Kingsmen (no relation to the later group of &quot;Louie, Louie&quot; fame) had a hit with an instrumental, &quot;Weekend&quot;, that same year.

Overseas, however, Haley and his band continued to be popular, touring the United Kingdom in February 1957, when Haley and his crew were mobbed by thousands of fans at Waterloo station in London at an incident which the media dubbed the &quot;Second Battle of Waterloo&quot;. The group also toured Australia in 1957, and in 1958 enjoyed a successful (if riot-dominated) tour of the European mainland. Bill Haley &amp; His Comets were the first major American rock and roll act to tour the world in this way. Elvis, who was on military duty in Germany, visited them backstage at some shows. On a free day in Berlin they performed two songs in the Caterina Valente movie &quot;Hier Bin ich Hier Bleib Ich (Here I Am Here I Stay)&quot;.

Back in the U.S., Haley attempted to start his own record label, Clymax, and establish his own stable of performers, notably Sally Starr (the hostess of a Philadelphia television children&#x27;s program) and the Matys Brothers. Members of the Comets were commissioned to work as session musicians on many of these recordings, many of which were written or co-written by Haley and members of the Comets. The Clymax experiment only lasted about a year. In 1959, Haley&#x27;s relationship with Decca collapsed; after a final set of instrumental-only recordings in the fall, Haley announced he was leaving Decca for the new Warner Bros. Records label, which released two more albums in 1960, which were moderately successful. In 1960 Franny Beecher and Rudi Pompilli left the Comets to start their own record label. Replacing Beecher was a 20-year-old guitarist, Johnny Kay, from Chester, Pennsylvania. Beecher later returned briefly to play with the Comets, when his record label failed to take off, sharing guitar duties with Kay. Kay left the band in 1966 but returned in the early 1970s for an aborted world tour. He appeared in the Wembley show, which was filmed and released as the London Rock and Roll Show.

==Mexico and the late 1960s==
In 1961–1962, Bill Haley y sus Cometas (as the band was known in Hispanic America) signed with the Orfeón label of Mexico and scored an unexpected hit with &quot;Twist Español&quot;, a Spanish-language recording based on the twist dance craze, which was sweeping America at the time. Haley followed up with &quot;Florida Twist&quot; (#3 MEX, according to Billboard Hits Of The World 04.21.62), which was for a time the biggest-selling single in Mexican history. Although Chubby Checker and Hank Ballard were credited with starting the twist craze in America, in Mexico and Latin America, Bill Haley and His Comets were proclaimed the Kings of the Twist. Thanks to the success of &quot;Twist Español&quot; and &quot;Florida Twist&quot;, among others, the band had continued success in Mexico and Latin America over the next few years, selling many recordings of Spanish and Spanish-flavored material and simulated live performances (overdubbed audience over studio recordings) on the Orfeon label and its subsidiary, Dimsa. They hosted a television series, &quot;Orfeon a Go-Go&quot;, and made cameo appearances in several movies, lip-synching some of their old hits. Haley, who was fluent in Spanish, recorded a number of songs in the language, but most of the band&#x27;s output during these years was instrumental recordings, many utilizing local session musicians playing trumpet. There was also some experimentation with Haley&#x27;s style during this time; one single for Orfeon was a folk ballad, &quot;Jimmy Martinez&quot;, which Haley recorded without the Comets.

In 1966, the Comets (without Bill Haley) cut an album for Orfeon as session musicians for Big Joe Turner, who had always been an idol to Haley; no joint performance of &quot;Shake, Rattle and Roll&quot; was recorded, however. In a 1974 interview with BBC Radio, Haley said Turner&#x27;s career was in a slump at this time, so he used his then-considerable influence with Orfeon to get Turner a recording session. The Comets&#x27; association with Orfeon/Dimsa ended later that year.

By 1967, as related by Haley in an interview with radio host Red Robinson in that year, the group was &quot;a free agent&quot; without any recording contracts at all, although the band continued to perform regularly in North America and Europe. During this year, Haley—without the Comets—recorded a pair of demos in Phoenix, Arizona: a country-western song, &quot;Jealous Heart&quot;, on which he was backed by a local mariachi band (similar in style to the earlier &quot;Jimmy Martinez&quot;), and a late-60s-style rocker, &quot;Rock on Baby&quot;, backed by a group called Superfine Dandelion. Neither recording would be released for 30 years. In 1968, Haley and the Comets recorded a single for the United Artists label, a version of Tom T. Hall&#x27;s &quot;That&#x27;s How I Got to Memphis&quot;, but no long-term association with the label resulted. In order to revive his recording career, Haley turned to Europe.

==Revival==

By the late 1960s, Haley and the Comets were considered an &quot;oldies&quot; act. The band&#x27;s popularity never waned in Europe. The group signed a lucrative deal with Sonet Records of Sweden in 1968 and recorded a new version of &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot;, which hit the European charts that year. The band recorded a mixture of live and studio albums for the label over the next decade.

In the United States in 1969, promoter Richard Nader launched a series of rock and roll revival concert tours featuring artists of the 1950s and 1960s. At one of the first of these shows, held at the Felt Forum at Madison Square Garden in New York City, Haley received an eight-and-a-half-minute standing ovation following his performance, as Nader related in his recorded introduction to Haley&#x27;s live album &quot;Bill Haley Scrapbook&quot;, which was recorded a few weeks later at the Bitter End club in New York.

The band appeared in several concert films in the early 1970s, including &quot;The London Rock and Roll Show&quot; (for which Haley&#x27;s 1960–66 lead guitarist, John Kay, briefly rejoined the band) and &quot;Let the Good Times Roll&quot;. After 1974, tax and management problems prevented Haley from performing in the United States, so he performed in Europe almost exclusively, though he also toured South America in 1975. The band was also kept busy in the studio, recording numerous albums for Sonet and other labels in the 1970s, several with a country music flavor. In 1974, Haley&#x27;s original Decca recording of &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; hit the American sales charts once again, thanks to its use in the film &quot;American Graffiti&quot; and for two years, on the television program &quot;Happy Days&quot;.

==Late career==
In February 1976, Haley&#x27;s saxophone player and best friend, Rudy Pompilli, died of cancer after a nearly 20-year career with the Comets. Haley continued to tour for the next year with a succession of new sax players, but his popularity was waning again, and his 1976 performance in London was critically lambasted in the music media, such as &quot;Melody Maker&quot;. That year, the group also recorded an album, &quot;R-O-C-K&quot; at Muscle Shoals Sound Studio for Sonet Records. According to one source, &quot;he had conflicted feelings about fame, was extremely private, suffered chronic alcoholism, and troubled relationships&quot;. Having admitted to an alcohol problem in a 1974 radio interview for the BBC, Haley continued to battle alcoholism into the 1970s. 
In early 1977, Haley announced his retirement from performing and settled down at his home in Mexico. According to the John Swenson biography of Haley, the musician was quoted as saying that he and Pompilli had an agreement that if one died, the other would retire.

The Comets continued to tour on their own during this period.

In 1979, Haley was persuaded to return to performing with the offer of a lucrative contract to tour Europe. An almost completely new group of musicians, mostly British, including saxophonist Pete Thomas, were assembled to perform as the Comets. Haley appeared on numerous television shows and in the movie &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot;, filmed at one of his London concerts in March 1979. A few days later, a performance in Birmingham was videotaped and aired on UK television; it was released on DVD in 2005. During the March tour, Haley recorded several tracks in London for his next album for Sonet, completing the work that summer in Muscle Shoals; the album, &quot;Everyone Can Rock &amp; Roll&quot;, issued later in 1979, was the last release of new recordings by Haley before his death.

On November 26, 1979, Haley and the Comets performed for Queen Elizabeth II, a moment Haley considered the proudest of his career. It was also the last time he performed in Europe and the last time most fans saw him perform &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot;.

Haley made his final performances in South Africa in May and June 1980. Just before the South African tour commenced, Haley&#x27;s health was reportedly failing, and he was reportedly diagnosed with a brain tumor; a planned tour of Germany in the autumn of 1980 was subsequently cancelled. The tour was critically lambasted, but surviving recordings of a performance in Johannesburg show Haley in good spirits and good voice. Nonetheless, according to the Haley News fan club newsletter and the Haley biography &quot;Sound and Glory&quot;, planned concerts (such as a fall 1980 tour of Germany) and proposed recording sessions in New York and Memphis were cancelled, including a potential reunion with past members of the Comets.

Despite his illness, Haley started compiling notes for possible use as a basis for either a biographical film based on his life, or a published autobiography (accounts differ), and there were plans for him to record an album in Memphis, Tennessee, when the brain tumor began affecting his behavior and he returned to his home in Harlingen, Texas. 
The October 25, 1980, issue of German tabloid &quot;Bild&quot; reported that Haley had a brain tumor. Haley&#x27;s British manager, Patrick Malynn, was quoted as saying that &quot;Haley had taken a fit [and] didn&#x27;t recognize anyone anymore.&quot; In addition, a doctor who examined Haley said that the tumor was inoperable. Haley&#x27;s widow Martha, who was with him in these troubling times, denied he had a brain tumor, as did his close friend Hugh McCallum. Martha and friends related that Haley did not want to go on the road anymore and that ticket sales for that planned tour of Germany in the fall of 1980 were slow. McCallum said, &quot;It&#x27;s my unproven gut feeling that that [the brain tumor] was said to curtail talks about the tour and play the sympathy card.&quot;

Haley returned to his home in Harlingen, Texas. At this time, Haley&#x27;s alcoholism appeared to be worsening. According to Martha, by this time, she and Haley fought all the time, and she told him to stop drinking or move out. Eventually, he moved into a room in their pool house. Martha still took care of him and sometimes, he would come in the house to eat, but he ate very little. &quot;There were days we never saw him,&quot; said his daughter Martha Maria. In addition to Haley&#x27;s drinking problems, it was becoming evident that he was also developing serious mental health issues. Martha Maria said, &quot;It was like sometimes he was drunk even when he wasn&#x27;t drinking.&quot; After being picked up by the police in Harlingen several times for alleged intoxication, Martha had a judge put Haley in the hospital, where he was seen by a psychiatrist, who said Haley&#x27;s brain was overproducing a chemical, like adrenaline. The doctor prescribed a medication to stop the overproduction, but said Haley would have to stop drinking. Martha said, &quot;This is pointless.&quot; She took him home, however, fed him and gave him his first dose. As soon as he felt better, he went back out to his room in the pool house, and the downward spiral continued until his death.

Media reports immediately following his death indicated that Haley displayed deranged and erratic behavior in the final weeks of his life. According to a biography of Haley by John Swenson, released in 1982, Haley made a succession of bizarre, mostly monologue late-night phone calls to friends and relatives toward the end of his life in which he was semi-coherent. His first wife has been quoted as saying, &quot;He would call you and ramble, dwelling on the past...&quot; The biography also describes Haley painting the windows of his home black, but there is little other information available about his final days.

Haley died in his sleep of an apparent heart attack on February 9, 1981, at the age of 55, at his home in Harlingen, Texas. He was discovered lying motionless on his bed by a friend who had stopped by to visit him. The friend immediately called the police, and Haley was pronounced dead at the scene. Haley&#x27;s death certificate gave &quot;natural causes, most likely a heart attack&quot; as the cause of death. Following a small funeral service attended by 75 people, Haley was cremated in Brownsville, Texas.

In April 1981, Bill Haley &amp; His Comets returned to the British musical charts once again when MCA Records (inheritors of the Decca catalogue) released &quot;Haley&#x27;s Golden Medley&quot;, a hastily compiled edit of the band&#x27;s best-known hits in the style of the then-popular &quot;Stars on 45&quot; format. The single reached Number 50 in the UK but was not released in the United States.

In 1987, Bill Haley was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. At that time, supporting bands were not also named to the Hall of Fame. This policy was subsequently changed, and in 2012 a special committee of the Hall of Fame inducted the Comets. Bill Haley and His Comets were also inducted into the Rockabilly Hall of Fame. In June 2005, Bill Haley And His Comets were inducted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame. In July 2005, the surviving members of the 1954–55 Comets (see below) represented Haley when Bill Haley and His Comets were inducted into Hollywood&#x27;s Rockwalk, a ceremony also attended by Haley&#x27;s second wife and youngest daughter. The Comets placed their handprints in cement, leaving a space blank for Haley.

==The Comets==
More than 100 musicians performed with Bill Haley &amp; His Comets between 1952 and Haley&#x27;s death in 1981, many becoming fan favorites along the way. Several short-lived Comets reunions were attempted in the 1970s and 1980s, including one contingent (organized by Baltimore-based piano player Joey Welz, who played piano for the Comets from 1962 to 1965) that appeared on &quot;The Tomorrow Show&quot;, and another run by an Elvis Presley impersonator, Joey Rand (this group later lost a legal action over the right to use the Comets name). Only one group was sent out to perform by Haley himself and his management and production company, consisting of musicians who had played with Haley throughout the 1960s and 1970s—lead guitarist &quot;Nick Masters&quot; (Mathias Nicholas Nastos), bassist Ray Cawley, singer Ray &quot;Pudge&quot; Parsons, and drummer Buddy Dee—and who had continued to perform as the Comets between gigs and during Haley&#x27;s retirement. This group rerecorded &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; for the television series &quot;Happy Days&quot;.

The Comets, featuring musicians who performed with Haley in 1954–1955, reunited in 1987 and are still touring the world as of 2007, playing showrooms in the United States and Europe. They have also recorded a half-dozen albums for small labels in Europe and the United States. This version of the group has also been credited as Bill Haley&#x27;s Original Comets and, in circumstances in which the use of the Comets name is in dispute, A Tribute to Bill Haley and The Original Band. The basic lineup of this group from 1987 to May 2006 was Marshall Lytle (bass), Joey Ambrose (sax), Johnny Grande (piano), Dick Richards (drums) and Franny Beecher (guitar). British singer Jacko Buddin augmented the group on vocals during most of their European tours, with Lytle taking over on vocals for US and Canadian tours beginning in 2000 and full-time in Europe in the mid-2000s. Since they connected with Klaus Kettner&#x27;s Rock It Concerts (Germany) in 1991, they have played hundreds of shows all over Europe and have appeared on dozens of television shows. In March 2007 they opened the Bill-Haley-Museum in Munich, Germany.

Two additional groups claim the name Bill Haley&#x27;s Comets and have extensively toured in the United States since forming in the 1980s: one originally led by Haley&#x27;s 1965–68 drummer John &quot;Bam-Bam&quot; Lane, the other run by Al Rappa, who played bass for Haley off and on between late 1959 and early 1969. (The 1959 album &quot;Strictly Instrumental&quot; on Decca was Rappa&#x27;s first recording session with Bill Haley &amp; His Comets. Haley had used Rappa as a fill-in player on live gigs for several years prior to that.) Both these musicians claim trademark ownership of the name &quot;Bill Haley&#x27;s Comets&quot;; this dates back to Lane and Rappa (during a period when they worked together as one band) winning a trademark infringement lawsuit against the aforementioned Joey Rand group in 1989. Both Rappa&#x27;s and Lane&#x27;s bands have, from time to time, recruited other former Comets for their lineups (for example, in 2005, Rappa joined forces with Joey Welz), but for the most part the bandleaders are the only regular members who have worked with Bill Haley directly. Lane died in 2007, but his group continues to perform, led by bandleader Lenny Longo, who has no direct connection with Bill Haley. Rappa incorporated numerous professional musicians from the southern Indiana area (Guitarist Warren Batts, Joe Esarey, Dave Matthews, Joe Denton, saxophonist John Urbina, bassist Jody Hamilton Miley (previous bassist with the George Jones Show), and others) to make a full band. Rappa performed his Upright Bass show before thousands in audiences all over the country. Members of Rappa&#x27;s &quot;Comets&quot; went on to form the LocoMotion Showband and continued touring the United States without Rappa adding Galen Deig (Drums) and Jimmy Baze (Bass) before eventually disbanding. Esarey went on to graduate from Cedarville University and Luther Rice Theological Seminary. He has since pastored churches and produced his own saxophone instrumental albums. Several of the members are now active in a very popular Southern Indiana 50&#x27;s / 60&#x27;s band called The Duke Boys.

In March and July 2005, the members of the 1954–55 group, now billed as simply the Comets after decades of controversy over the use of the name, made several high-profile concert appearances in New York City and Los Angeles organized by Martin Lewis as part of celebrations marking the 50th anniversary of rock and roll, the release of &quot;Blackboard Jungle&quot;, the 50th anniversary of &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; hitting Number 1, and the 80th birthday of Bill Haley. During a concert at the Viper Room in West Hollywood on July 6, 2005, the Comets were joined on stage for one song by Gina Haley, the youngest daughter of Bill Haley; at a similar appearance in March they were joined by Haley&#x27;s eldest son, John W. Haley. The 1954–55 Comets were also joined on stage by Bill Haley Jr. during several appearances in 2005 at Bubba Mac&#x27;s in Somers Point, New Jersey, and at a 2005 concert recognizing the tenure of Bill Haley and the Saddlemen at the Twin Bars in Gloucester City, New Jersey.

In 2006, the 1954–55 Comets spent much of the year in residence at Dick Clark&#x27;s American Bandstand Theater in Branson, Missouri. Meanwhile, the John Lane edition of Bill Haley&#x27;s Comets recorded an album in Tennessee in early 2006, which has yet to be released.

On June 2, 2006, Johnny Grande, keyboardist with the 1954–55 Comets and a founding member of the band, died after a short illness. The following month, 85-year-old guitarist Franny Beecher announced his retirement, though he was at one point announced as participating in an early 2007 tour of Germany. The three remaining original Comets (Lytle, Richards, and Ambrose) continued to perform in Branson with new musicians taking over the keyboard and lead guitar positions. During September 2006, PBS in the United States aired a series of programs videotaped in Branson during the spring of 2006; these shows include the last recorded performances of the complete Original Comets lineup, including Grande. Lytle died in 2013, Beecher in 2014. The last remaining members of the 1954–55 Comets, Dick Richards and Joey Ambrose, continued to perform as the Comets as of mid-2018, sometimes augmented by 1970s-era Comet Bill Turner on lead guitar.

John &quot;Bam-Bam&quot; Lane died on February 18, 2007 but his edition of Bill Haley&#x27;s Comets is expected to continue touring, with the 2006 recordings to be released in Lane&#x27;s memory.

On October 27, 2007, ex-Comets guitar player Bill Turner opened the aforementioned Bill-Haley-Museum in Munich, Germany. He will also join the New Comets during their Remember Bill Haley Tour 2011 with Haley&#x27;s daughter Gina Haley.

Several bands patterning themselves after the Comets are also active in Europe, including Bill Haley&#x27;s New Comets in Germany.

In 2011, Haley&#x27;s son Bill Jr. formed the band Bill Haley Jr. and the Comets, and created a Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll History Show.

On July 12, 2019, drummer Dick Richards died at age 95 in Ocean City, New Jersey. He was born Richard Marley Boccelli on February 12, 1924, in Yeadon, Pennsylvania.

On May 24, 2020, ex-Comet bassist, Albert &quot;Al Rex&quot; Piccirilli, died.

Al Rappa died on July 25, 2021, aged 94.

Original saxophone player Joseph Frank D&#x27;Ambrosio (stage name Joey Ambrose; March 23, 1934 – August 9, 2021), played on the hit recording of &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; in 1954 but from September 1955 was replaced long-term by Rudy Pompilli until Rudy&#x27;s death 20 years later. Joey Ambrose remained a musician and was the last Comet to pass away, at 87, on August 9, 2021.

<text>René Dumont (13 March 1904 – 18 June 2001) was a French engineer in agronomy, a sociologist, and an environmental politician.

== Biography ==
Dumont was born in Cambrai, Nord, in the north of France. His father was a professor in agriculture and his grandfather was a farmer. He graduated from the INA P-G, as an engineer in agronomy. First sent to Vietnam (1929) at the end of his studies, he was disgusted by colonialism and returned to Paris to spend most of his career as a professor of agricultural sciences (1933–74).
René Dumont started his career as a promoter of the use of chemical fertilizers and mechanisation. He wrote articles in &quot;La Terre Française&quot; (Pétainist weekly journal), favoring agricultural corporatism. However, he was one of the first to denounce damages from the Green Revolution (&quot;Révolution Verte&quot;) and to fight agricultural productivism. He was an expert with the United Nations and FAO, and wrote about 30 books. He traveled widely and had a good understanding of farming issues in underdeveloped countries.

He advocated:
* demographic control
* energy savings
* international cooperation to help poor nations
* soil quality preservation and remediation

He considered development not to be so much a question of money, fertilizer, or seeds, but a careful balance of the three. He advocated relations between humans and their fields that relied foremost on relations between humans themselves, social relationships being the basis for proper agricultural and industrial development. Finally, he believed the basis for good social relationships between humans was good relationships between men and women, thus arguing demographic control relied on female emancipation.

Ahead of his time, the most famous French agronomist, well known for his red-pullover, surprised French people by showing on TV an apple and a glass of water, telling them how precious these natural resources were, and predicting the future price of oil. Dumont was one of the first to explain the consequences of what was to be called globalization, demographic explosion, productivism, pollution, shantytowns, malnutrition, rift between northern and southern countries. He was also one of the first to use the term &quot;développement durable&quot; (sustainable development).

He was one of the signatories of the agreement to convene a convention for drafting a world constitution. As a result, for the first time in human history, a World Constituent Assembly convened to draft and adopt a Constitution for the Federation of Earth.

He ran for President in 1974 as the first ecologist candidate, and won 1.32% of the votes. His campaign director was Brice Lalonde. That election opened the way to political ecology. The French political ecology was founded by Dumont and is under-developed countries oriented, against war, against capitalism and for solidarity. Some consider it not sufficiently rooted in deep ecology.

Dumont is considered to be the forefather of the French Green Party. In a statement, France&#x27;s Green Party called Dumont &quot;the man who made it possible to bring environmental policies in a direct and natural manner into the political world&quot;.

He wrote a best-selling book, &quot;L’Afrique noire est mal partie&quot; (1962).

Dumont was a founding member of ATTAC.

<text>A ring road (also known as circular road, beltline, beltway, circumferential (high)way, loop or orbital) is a road or a series of connected roads encircling a town, city or country. The most common purpose of a ring road is to assist in reducing traffic volumes in the urban centre, such as by offering an alternate route around the city for drivers who do not need to stop in the city core. Ring roads can also serve to connect suburbs to each other, allowing efficient travel between them.

==Nomenclature==

The name &quot;ring road&quot; is used for the majority of metropolitan circumferential routes in Europe, such as the Berliner Ring, the Brussels Ring, the Amsterdam Ring and the Leeds Inner and Outer ring roads. Australia, Pakistan and India also use the term ring road, as in Melbourne&#x27;s Western Ring Road, Lahore&#x27;s Lahore Ring Road and Hyderabad&#x27;s Outer Ring Road. In Canada the term is the most commonly used, with &quot;orbital&quot; also used, but to a much lesser extent.

In Europe and Australia, some ring roads, particularly longer ones of motorway standard, are known as &quot;orbital motorways&quot;. Examples are the London Orbital (generally known as the M25; 188 km), Sydney Orbital Network (110 km) and Rome Orbital (68 km).

In the United States many ring roads are called beltlines, beltways or loops, such as the Capital Beltway around Washington, D.C. Some ring roads, such as Washington&#x27;s Capital Beltway, use &quot;Inner Loop&quot; and &quot;Outer Loop&quot; terminology for directions of travel, since cardinal (compass) directions cannot be signed uniformly around the entire loop. The term &#x27;ring road&#x27; is occasionally – and inaccurately – used interchangeably with the term &#x27;bypass&#x27;.

==Background==
Bypasses around many large and small towns were built in many areas when many old roads were converted to four-lane status in the 1930s to 1950s, such as those along the Old National Road (now generally U.S. 40 or Interstate 70) in the United States, leaving the old road in place to serve the town or city, but allowing through travelers to continue on a wider, faster and safer route.

Construction of fully circumferential ring roads has generally occurred more recently, beginning in the 1960s in many areas, when the U.S. Interstate Highway System and similar-quality roads elsewhere were designed. Ring roads have now been built around numerous cities and metropolitan areas, including cities with multiple ring roads, irregularly shaped ring roads and ring roads made up of various other long-distance roads.

London has three ring roads (the M25 motorway, the North and South Circular roads and the Inner Ring Road). Birmingham also has three ring roads which consist of the Birmingham Box; the A4540, commonly known as the Middleway; and the A4040, the Outer Ring Road. Birmingham once had a fourth ring road, the A4400. This has been partially demolished and downgraded to improve traffic flow into the city. Other British cities have two: Leeds, Sheffield, Norwich and Glasgow. Cleveland, OH and San Antonio, TX, in the United States, also each have two, while Houston, Texas will have three official ring roads (not including the downtown freeway loop). Some cities have far more Beijing, for example, has six ring roads, simply numbered in increasing order from the city center (though skipping #1), while Moscow has five, three innermost (Central Squares of Moscow, Boulevard Ring and Garden Ring) corresponding to the concentric lines of fortifications around the ancient city, and the two outermost (MKAD and Third Ring) built in the twentieth century, though, confusingly, the Third Ring was built last.

Geographical constraints can complicate the construction of a complete ring road. For example, the Baltimore Beltway in Maryland formerly crossed Baltimore Harbor on a high arch bridge prior to its collapse in 2024, and much of the partially completed Stockholm Ring Road in Sweden runs through tunnels or over long bridges. Some towns or cities on sea coasts or near rugged mountains cannot have a full ring road. Examples of such partial ring roads are Dublin&#x27;s ring road; and, in the US, Interstate 287, mostly in New Jersey (bypassing New York City), and Interstate 495 around Boston, none of which completely circles these seaport cities.

In other cases, adjacent international boundaries may prevent ring road completion. Construction of a true ring road around Detroit is effectively blocked by its location on the border with Canada and the Detroit River; although constructing a route mostly or entirely outside city limits is technically feasible, a true ring around Detroit would necessarily pass through Canada, and so Interstate 275 and Interstate 696 together bypass but do not encircle the city. Sometimes, the presence of significant natural or historical areas limits route options, as for the long-proposed Outer Beltway around Washington, D.C., where options for a new western Potomac River crossing are limited by a nearly continuous corridor of heavily visited scenic, natural, and historical landscapes in the Potomac River Gorge and adjacent areas.

When referring to a road encircling a capital city, the term &quot;beltway&quot; can also have a political connotation, as in the American term &quot;Inside the Beltway&quot;, derived metonymically from the Capital Beltway encircling Washington, D.C.

== Impact ==
Ring roads have been criticised for inducing demand, leading to more car journeys being taken and thus higher levels of pollution being created. By creating easy access by car to large areas of land, they can also act as a catalyst for development, leading to urban sprawl and car-centric planning. Ring roads have also been criticised for splitting communities and being difficult to navigate for pedestrians and cyclists.

==Examples==


Most orbital motorways (or beltways) are purpose-built major highways around a town or city, typically without either signals or road or railroad crossings. In the United States, beltways are commonly parts of the Interstate Highway System. Similar roads in the United Kingdom are often called &quot;orbital motorways&quot;. Although the terms &quot;ring road&quot; and &quot;orbital motorway&quot; are sometimes used interchangeably, &quot;ring road&quot; often indicates a circumferential route formed from one or more existing roads within a city or town, with the standard of road being anything from an ordinary city street up to motorway level. An excellent example of this is London&#x27;s North Circular/South Circular ring roads, which are largely made up of (mainly congested) ordinary city streets.

In some cases, a circumferential route is formed by the combination of a major through highway and a similar-quality loop route that extends out from the parent road, later reconnecting with the same highway. Such loops not only function as a bypass for through traffic, but also to serve outlying suburbs. In the United States, an Interstate highway loop is usually designated by a three-digit number beginning with an even digit before the two-digit number of its parent interstate. Interstate spurs, on the other hand, generally have three-digit numbers beginning with an odd digit.

===United States===

Within the United States, even numbered three digit interstate highways act a circumferential route of the two digit parent interstate. Some instances (such as Interstate 495, DC) completely circle, while some (such as Interstate 495, MA) partially loop, either due to geographical or cancelled/non-completed highways. Within cities, ring roads sometimes have local nicknames; these include Washington DC&#x27;s Interstate 495 (The &quot;Capital Beltway&quot;), Interstate 270 in Columbus, Ohio (The &quot;Outerbelt&quot;), and Interstate 285 in Atlanta (The &quot;Perimeter&quot;).

The longest complete beltway in the United States is the Charles W. Anderson Loop, a loop in Texas that forms a complete loop around the Greater San Antonio area.

The longest complete belt road, or a beltway that is only two lanes, in the United States is Hawaii Belt Road, a belt in Hawaii that forms a complete belt road around Hawaii Island.

There are other U.S. superhighway beltway systems that consist of multiple routes that require multiple interchanges and thus do not provide true ring routes. Two designated examples are the Capital Beltway around Harrisburg, Pennsylvania using Interstate 81, Interstate 83, and Pennsylvania Route 581 and &quot;The Bypass&quot; around South Bend, Indiana using Interstate 80, Interstate 90, U.S. Route 31, and Indiana State Road 331.

===Canada===

Edmonton, Alberta, has two ring roads. The first is a loose conglomeration of four major arterial roads with an average distance of from the downtown core. Yellowhead Trail forms the northern section, Wayne Gretzky Drive/75 Street forms the eastern section, Whitemud Drive forms the southern and longest section, and 170 Street forms the western and shortest section. Whitemud Drive is the only section that is a true controlled-access highway, while Yellowhead Trail and Wayne Gretzky Drive have interchanges and intersections and are therefore both limited-access roads. Yellowhead Trail is currently being upgraded to full freeway standards. 170 Street and 75 Street are merely large arterial roads with intersections only. The second and more prominent ring road is named Anthony Henday Drive; it circles the city at an average distance of from the downtown core. It is a freeway for its entire length, and was built to reduce inner-city traffic congestion, created a bypass of Yellowhead Trail, and has improved the movement of goods and services across Edmonton and the surrounding areas. It was completed in October 2016 as the first free-flowing orbital road in Canada.

Stoney Trail is a ring road that circles the city of Calgary, Alberta, for an entire length of .

Winnipeg, Manitoba, has a ring road which is called the Perimeter Highway. It is designated as Manitoba Highway 101 on the north, northwest and east sides and as Manitoba Highway 100 on the south and southwest sides. The majority of it is a four-lane divided expressway. It has a second ring road, planned since the 1950s and not yet completed, called the Suburban Beltway. It consists of several roads—Lagimodière Boulevard, Abinojii Mikanah, the Fort Garry Bridge, the Moray Bridge, William R Clement Parkway, Chief Peguis Trail and the Kildonan Bridge.

Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, has a ring road named Circle Drive. It is cosigned as Saskatchewan Highway 16 and Saskatchewan Highway 11 along the whole route since the 2013 opening of Circle Drive South.

Regina, Saskatchewan has a partial ring road that is named Ring Road; however, due to the city&#x27;s urban growth since the road was originally constructed, it no longer functions as a true ring road and has instead come to be used partially for local arterial traffic. The Regina Bypass, a new partial ring road, has replaced it, although Ring Road must still be used in the northeast quadrant of the city.

Hamilton, Ontario, has the Lincoln M. Alexander Parkway, Highway 403 and the Red Hill Valley Parkway which form a ring on three sides.

Sudbury, Ontario, has a partial ring road consisting of the Southwest and Southeast Bypasses segment of Highway 17, and the Northwest Bypass segment of Highway 144. An unofficial northeast &quot;bypass&quot; route can also be completed on city arterial roads that largely bypass the urban core of the city, but are not fully controlled-access and must be shared with local traffic in the Nickel Centre and Rayside-Balfour districts of the city.

===Europe===

Most major cities in Europe are served by a ring road that circles either the inner core of their metropolitan areas or the outer borders of the city proper or both. In major transit hubs, such as the Île-de-France region surrounding Paris and the Frankfurt area, major national highways converge just outside city limits before forming one of several routes of an urban network of roads circling the city. Unlike in United States, route numbering is not a challenge on European ring roads as routes merge to form the single designated road. However, exit and road junction access can be challenging due to the complexity of other routes branching from or into the ring road.

One of the most renowned ring roads is the Vienna Ring Road (&quot;Ringstraße&quot;), a grand boulevard constructed in the mid-19th century and filled with representative buildings. Due to its unique architectural beauty and history, it has also been called the &quot;Lord of the ring roads&quot;, and is declared by UNESCO as part of Vienna&#x27;s World Heritage Site.

<doc id="51924" wikidata="Q7805963" url="?curid=51924" title="Timeline of the United States diplomatic history">
<text>The diplomatic history of the United States oscillated among three positions: isolation from diplomatic entanglements of other (typically European) nations (but with economic connections to the world); alliances with European and other military partners; and unilateralism, or operating on its own sovereign policy decisions. The US always was large in terms of area, but its population was small, only 4 million in 1790. Population growth was rapid, reaching 7.2 million in 1810, 32 million in 1860, 76 million in 1900, 132 million in 1940, and 316 million in 2013. Economic growth in terms of overall GDP was even faster. However, the nation&#x27;s military strength was quite limited in peacetime before 1940.

<text>Secotioid fungi produce an intermediate fruiting body form that is between the mushroom-like hymenomycetes and the closed bag-shaped gasteromycetes, where an evolutionary process of gasteromycetation has started but not run to completion. Secotioid fungi may or may not have opening caps, but in any case they often lack the vertical geotropic orientation of the hymenophore needed to allow the spores to be dispersed by wind, and the basidiospores are not forcibly discharged or otherwise prevented from being dispersed (e.g. gills completely inclosed and never exposed as in the secotioid form of &quot;Lentinus tigrinus&quot;)—note—some mycologists do not consider a species to be secotioid unless it has lost ballistospory.

==Explanation of secotioid development and gasteromycetation==

Historically agarics and boletes (which bear their spores on a hymenium of gills or tubes respectively) were classified quite separately from the gasteroid fungi, such as puff-balls and truffles, of which the spores are formed in a large mass enclosed in an outer skin. However, in spite of this apparently very great difference in form, recent mycological research, both at microscopic and molecular level has shown that sometimes species of open mushrooms are much more closely related to particular species of gasteroid fungi than they are to each other. Fungi which do not open up to let their spores be dispersed in the air, but which show a clear morphological relation to agarics or boletes, constitute an intermediate form and are called secotioid.

The word is derived from the name of the genus &quot;Secotium&quot;, which was defined in 1840 by Kunze for a South African example, &quot;S. gueinzii&quot;, which is the type species. In the following years numerous secotioid species were added to this genus, including ones which according to modern taxonomy belong to other genera or families.

On a microscopic scale, secotioid fungi do not expel their spores forcibly from the basidium; their spores are &quot;statismospores&quot;. Like gasteroid fungi, secotioid species rely on animals such as rodents or insects to distribute their spores.

It can at times be disadvantageous for a mushroom to open up and free its spores in the usual way. If this development is aborted, a secotioid form arises, perhaps to be followed eventually by an evolutionary progression to a fully gasteroid form. This type of progression is called gasteromycetation and seems to have happened several times independently starting from various genera of &quot;normal&quot; mushrooms. This means that the secotioid and also the gasteroid fungi are polyphyletic. According to the paper by Thiers, in certain climates and certain seasons, it may be an advantage to remain closed, because moisture can be conserved in that way.
For example, the gasteroid genus &quot;Hymenogaster&quot; has been shown to be closely related to agaric genera such as &quot;Hebeloma&quot;, which were formerly placed in family Cortinariaceae or Strophariaceae. This is found by DNA analysis and also indicated on a microscopic scale by the resemblance of the spores and basidia. According to a current classification system, &quot;Hebeloma&quot; now belongs to family Hymenogastraceae, and is considered more narrowly related to the closed &quot;Hymenogaster&quot; fungi than, for instance, to the ordinary mushrooms in genus &quot;Cortinarius&quot;.

A similar case is the well-known &quot;Deceiver&quot; mushroom &quot;Laccaria laccata&quot; which is now classified in the &quot;Hydnangiaceae&quot;, &quot;Hydnangium&quot; being a gastroid genus.

It has been found that a change in a single locus of a gene of the gilled mushroom &quot;Lentinus tigrinus&quot; causes it to have a closed fruiting body. This suggests that the emergence of a secotioid species may not require many mutations.

There is a spectrum of secotioid species ranging from the open form to the closed form in the following respects:
*there may be an evident stipe, or there may be only a remnant consisting of a column of non-fertile tissue,
*if there is a stipe the edge of the cap may separate from it (partially opening), or may not,
*there may be recognizable gills (though oriented in all directions and very convoluted), or the fertile interior may be uniform like the gleba of gasteroid fungi, and
*the spore-bearing tissue may be above ground (epigeous), or underground (), or partly buried.

The adjective &quot;sequestrate&quot; is sometimes used as a general term to mean &quot;either secotioid or gasteroid&quot;.

==Examples==
&quot;Cortinarius&quot; is a very widespread genus of agarics, but also contains some secotioid species, such as &quot;C. leucocephalus&quot;, &quot;C. coneae&quot; and &quot;C. cartilagineus&quot;.
&quot;Pholiota nubigena&quot; is a secotioid species found early in the year at high altitude in the western United States. It was originally assigned to &quot;Secotium&quot; and later to a more specific secotioid genus &quot;Nivatogastrium&quot;, but in fact it is closely allied to &quot;Pholiota squarrosa&quot; and it has now been moved to genus &quot;Pholiota&quot; itself, although the latter consists primarily of agarics.

&quot;Gastroboletus&quot; is a secotioid bolete genus where the fruiting bodies may or may not open, but in any case the tubes are not aligned vertically as in a true bolete.

Secotioid mushrooms of the genus &quot;Endoptychum&quot; (such as &quot;E. agaricoides&quot;, &quot;E. arizonicum&quot;) have been now moved to genus &quot;Chlorophyllum&quot;, closely related to &quot;Macrolepiota&quot;. 
&quot;Agaricus deserticola&quot; is a secotioid species of &quot;Agaricus&quot; (the genus of common cultivated mushrooms) which at one time was placed in the genus &quot;Secotium&quot;. Similarly, &quot;Agaricus inapertus&quot; was formerly known as &quot;Endoptychum depressum&quot; until molecular analysis revealed it to be closely aligned with &quot;Agaricus&quot;.

<text>The National Railroad Passenger Corporation, doing business as Amtrak (; ), is the national passenger railroad company of the United States. It operates intercity rail service in 46 of the 48 contiguous U.S. states and 3 Canadian provinces. &quot;Amtrak&quot; is a portmanteau of the words &quot;America&quot; and &quot;track.&quot;

Founded in 1971 as a quasi-public corporation to operate many U.S. passenger rail routes, Amtrak receives a combination of state and federal subsidies but is managed as a for-profit organization. The company&#x27;s headquarters is located one block west of Union Station in Washington, D.C. Amtrak is headed by a Board of Directors, two of whom are the Secretary of Transportation and CEO of Amtrak, while the other eight members are nominated to serve a term of five years.

Amtrak&#x27;s network includes over 500 stations along of track. It directly owns approximately of this track and operates an additional 132 miles of track; the remaining mileage is over rail lines owned by other railroad companies. While most track speeds are limited to or less, several lines have been upgraded to support top speeds of , and parts of the Northeast Corridor support top speeds of .

In fiscal year 2022, Amtrak served 22.9 million passengers and had $2.1 billion in revenue, with more than 17,100 employees as of fiscal year 2021. Nearly 87,000 passengers ride more than 300 Amtrak trains daily. Nearly two-thirds of passengers come from the 10 largest metropolitan areas and 83% of passengers travel on routes shorter than .

==History==
===Private passenger service===

In 1916, 98% of all commercial intercity travelers in the United States moved by rail, and the remaining 2% moved by inland waterways. Nearly 42 million passengers used railways as primary transportation. Passenger trains were owned and operated by the same privately owned companies that operated freight trains. As the 20th century progressed, patronage declined in the face of competition from buses, air travel, and the car. New streamlined diesel-powered trains such as the &quot;Pioneer Zephyr&quot; were popular with the traveling public but could not reverse the trend. By 1940, railroads held 67 percent of commercial passenger-miles in the United States. In real terms, passenger-miles had fallen by 40% since 1916, from 42 billion to 25 billion.

Traffic surged during World War II, which was aided by troop movement and gasoline rationing. The railroad&#x27;s market share surged to 74% in 1945, with a massive 94 billion passenger-miles. After the war, railroads rejuvenated their overworked and neglected passenger fleets with fast and luxurious streamliners. These new trains brought only temporary relief to the overall decline. Even as postwar travel exploded, passenger travel percentages of the overall market share fell to 46% by 1950, and then 32% by 1957. The railroads had lost money on passenger service since the Great Depression, but deficits reached $723 million in 1957. For many railroads, these losses threatened financial viability.

The causes of this decline were heavily debated. The National Highway System and airports, both funded by the government, competed directly with the railroads, which, unlike the airline, bus, and trucking companies, paid for their own infrastructure. American car culture was also on the rise in the post-World War II years. Progressive Era rate regulation limited the railroad&#x27;s ability to turn a profit. Railroads also faced antiquated work rules and inflexible relationships with trade unions. To take one example, workers continued to receive a day&#x27;s pay for workdays. Streamliners covered that in two hours.

Matters approached a crisis in the 1960s. Passenger service route-miles fell from in 1958 to in 1970, the last full year of private operation. The diversion of most United States Post Office Department mail from passenger trains to trucks, airplanes, and freight trains in late 1967 deprived those trains of badly needed revenue. In direct response, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway filed to discontinue 33 of its remaining 39 trains, ending almost all passenger service on one of the largest railroads in the country. The equipment the railroads had ordered after World War II was now 20 years old, worn out, and in need of replacement.

===Formation===
As passenger service declined, various proposals were brought forward to rescue it. The 1961 Doyle Report proposed that the private railroads pool their services into a single body. Similar proposals were made in 1965 and 1968 but failed to attract support. The federal government passed the High Speed Ground Transportation Act of 1965 to fund pilot programs in the Northeast Corridor, but this did nothing to address passenger deficits. In late 1969, multiple proposals emerged in the United States Congress, including equipment subsidies, route subsidies, and, lastly, a &quot;quasi-public corporation&quot; to take over the operation of intercity passenger trains. Matters were brought to a head on June 21, 1970, when the Penn Central, the largest railroad in the Northeastern United States and teetering on bankruptcy, filed to discontinue 34 of its passenger trains.

In October 1970, Congress passed, and President Richard Nixon signed into law (against the objections of most of his advisors), the Rail Passenger Service Act. Proponents of the bill, led by the National Association of Railroad Passengers (NARP), sought government funding to ensure the continuation of passenger trains. They conceived the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (NRPC), a quasi-public corporation that would be managed as a for-profit organization, but which would receive taxpayer funding and assume operation of intercity passenger trains – while many involved in drafting the bill did not believe the NRPC would actually be profitable, this was necessary in order for the White House and more conservative members of Congress to support the bill.

There were several key provisions:
* Any railroad operating intercity passenger service could contract with the NRPC, thereby joining the national system.
* The United States federal government, through the Secretary of Transportation, would own all of the NRPC&#x27;s issued and outstanding preferred stock. 
* Participating railroads bought into the NRPC using a formula based on their recent intercity passenger losses. The purchase price could be satisfied either by cash or rolling stock; in exchange, the railroads received NRPC common stock.
* Any participating railroad was freed of the obligation to operate intercity passenger service after May 1, 1971, except for those services chosen by the Department of Transportation (DOT) as part of a &quot;basic system&quot; of service and paid for by NRPC using its federal funds.
* Railroads that chose not to join the NRPC system were required to continue operating their existing passenger service until 1975, at which time they could pursue the customary Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) approval process for any discontinuance or alteration to the service.

Of the 26 railroads still offering intercity passenger service in 1970, only six declined to join the NRPC.

Nearly everyone involved expected the experiment to be short-lived. The Nixon administration and many Washington insiders viewed the NRPC as a politically expedient way for the President and Congress to give passenger trains a &quot;last hurrah&quot; as demanded by the public. They expected the NRPC to quietly disappear as public interest waned. After &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine exposed the manufactured mismanagement in 1974, Louis W. Menk, chairman of the Burlington Northern Railroad, remarked that the story was undermining the scheme to dismantle Amtrak. Proponents also hoped that government intervention would be brief and that Amtrak would soon be able to support itself. Neither view had proved to be correct; popular support allowed Amtrak to continue in operation longer than critics imagined, while financial results made passenger train service returning to private railroad operations infeasible.

===Selection of initial routes===

The Rail Passenger Service Act gave the Secretary of Transportation, at that time John A. Volpe, thirty days to produce an initial draft of the endpoints of the routes the NRPC would be required by law to serve for four years. On November 24 Volpe presented his initial draft consisting of 27 routes to Nixon, which he believed would make a $24 million profit by 1975. The Office of Management and Budget, however, believed Volpe and the DOT&#x27;s analysis was far too optimistic, with director George Shultz arguing to cut the number of routes by around half. Nixon agreed with Shultz, and the public draft presented by Volpe on November 30 consisted of only 16 routes.

The initial reaction to this heavily-cut-back proposed system from the public, the press, and congressmen was strongly negative. It made front-page headlines across the country and it was quickly leaked that the DOT had wanted a far larger system than the White House would approve of. The ICC produced its own report on December 29, criticising the proposed draft and arguing for the inclusion of 15 additional routes, giving further ammunition to the congressmen who wanted an expanded system. Further wrangling between the DOT and the White House produced the final list of routes on January 28, 1971, adding 5 additional routes to the November 30th draft.

These required routes only had their endpoints specified; the selection of the actual routes to be taken between the endpoints was left to the NRPC, which had just three months to decide them before it was due to start service. Consultants from McKinsey &amp; Company were hired to perform this task, and their results were publicly announced on March 22.

At the same time, the NRPC had hired Lippincott &amp; Margulies to create a brand for it and replace its original working brand name of Railpax. On March 30, L&amp;M&#x27;s work was presented to the NRPC&#x27;s board of incorporators, who unanimously agreed on the &quot;headless arrow&quot; logo and on the new brand name &quot;Amtrak&quot;, a portmanteau of the words &quot;America&quot; and &quot;trak&quot;, the latter itself a sensational spelling of &quot;track&quot;. The name change was publicly announced less than two weeks before operations began.

===1970s: The Rainbow Era===

Amtrak began operations on May 1, 1971. Amtrak received no rail tracks or rights-of-way at its inception. All of Amtrak&#x27;s routes were continuations of prior service, although Amtrak pruned about half the passenger rail network. Of the 366 train routes that operated previously, Amtrak continued only 184. Several major corridors became freight-only, including the ex-New York Central Railroad&#x27;s Water Level Route from New York to Ohio and Grand Trunk Western Railroad&#x27;s Chicago to Detroit route. The reduced passenger train schedules created confusion amongst staff. At some stations, Amtrak service was available only late at night or early in the morning, prompting complaints from passengers. Disputes with freight railroads over track usage caused some services to be rerouted, temporarily cancelled, or replaced with buses. On the other hand, the creation of the Los Angeles–Seattle &quot;Coast Starlight&quot; from three formerly separate train routes was an immediate success, resulting in an increase to daily service by 1973.

Needing to operate only half the train routes that had operated previously, Amtrak would lease around 1,200 of the best passenger cars from the 3,000 that the private railroads owned. All were air-conditioned, and 90% were easy-to-maintain stainless steel. When Amtrak took over, passenger cars and locomotives initially retained the paint schemes and logos of their former owners which resulted in Amtrak running trains with mismatched colors – the &quot;Rainbow Era&quot;. In mid-1971, Amtrak began purchasing some of the equipment it had leased, including 286 EMD E and F unit diesel locomotives, 30 GG1 electric locomotives and 1,290 passenger cars. By 1975, the official Amtrak color scheme was painted on most Amtrak equipment and newly purchased locomotives and the rolling stock began appearing.

Amtrak inherited problems with train stations (most notably deferred maintenance) and redundant facilities from the competing railroads that once served the same communities. Chicago is a prime example; on the day prior to Amtrak&#x27;s inception, intercity passenger trains used four different Chicago terminals: LaSalle, Dearborn, North Western Station, Central, and Union. The trains at LaSalle remained there, as their operator Rock Island could not afford to opt into Amtrak. Of all the trains serving Dearborn Station, Amtrak retained only a pair of Santa Fe trains, which relocated to Union Station beginning with the first Amtrak departures on May 1, 1971. Dearborn Station closed after the last pre-Amtrak trains on the Santa Fe arrived in Chicago on May 2. None of the intercity trains that had served North Western Station became part of the Amtrak system, and that terminal became commuter-only after May 1. The trains serving Central Station continued to use that station until an alternate routing was adopted in March 1972. In New York City, Amtrak had to maintain two stations (Penn and Grand Central) due to the lack of track connections to bring trains from upstate New York into Penn Station; a problem that was rectified once the Empire Connection was built in 1991. The Amtrak Standard Stations Program was launched in 1978 and proposed to build a standardized station design across the system with an aim to reduce costs, speed construction, and improve its corporate image. However, the cash-strapped railroad would ultimately build relatively few of these standard stations.

Amtrak soon had the opportunity to acquire rights-of-way. Following the bankruptcy of several northeastern railroads in the early 1970s, including Penn Central, which owned and operated the Northeast Corridor (NEC), Congress passed the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976. A large part of the legislation was directed to the creation of Conrail, but the law also enabled the transfer of the portions of the NEC not already owned by state authorities to Amtrak. Amtrak acquired the majority of the NEC on April 1, 1976. (The portion in Massachusetts is owned by the Commonwealth and managed by Amtrak. The route from New Haven to New Rochelle is owned by New York&#x27;s Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the Connecticut Department of Transportation as the New Haven Line.) This mainline became Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;jewel&quot; asset, and helped the railroad generate revenue. While the NEC ridership and revenues were higher than any other segment of the system, the cost of operating and maintaining the corridor proved to be overwhelming. As a result, Amtrak&#x27;s federal subsidy was increased dramatically. In subsequent years, other short route segments not needed for freight operations were transferred to Amtrak.

In its first decade, Amtrak fell far short of financial independence, which continues today, but it did find modest success rebuilding trade. Outside factors discouraged competing transport, such as fuel shortages which increased costs of automobile and airline travel, and strikes which disrupted airline operations. Investments in Amtrak&#x27;s track, equipment and information also made Amtrak more relevant to America&#x27;s transportation needs. Amtrak&#x27;s ridership increased from 16.6 million in 1972 to 21 million in 1981.

In February 1978, Amtrak moved its headquarters to 400 North Capitol Street NW, Washington D.C.

===1980s and 1990s: The Building Era===

In 1982, former Secretary of the Navy and retired Southern Railway head William Graham Claytor Jr. came out of retirement to lead Amtrak. During his time at Southern, Claytor was a vocal critic of Amtrak&#x27;s prior managers, who all came from non-railroading backgrounds. Transportation Secretary Drew Lewis cited this criticism as a reason why the Democrat Claytor was acceptable to the Reagan White House. Despite frequent clashes with the Reagan administration over funding, Claytor enjoyed a good relationship with Lewis, John H. Riley, the head of the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), and with members of Congress. Limited funding led Claytor to use short-term debt to fund operations.

Building on mechanical developments in the 1970s, high-speed Washington–New York Metroliner Service was improved with new equipment and faster schedules. Travel time between New York and Washington, D.C. was reduced to under 3 hours due to system improvements and limited stop service. This improvement was cited as a reason why Amtrak grew its share of intercity trips between the cities along the corridor. Elsewhere in the country, demand for passenger rail service resulted in the creation of five new state-supported routes in California, Illinois, Missouri, Oregon and Pennsylvania, for a total of 15 state-supported routes.

Amtrak added two trains in 1983, the &quot;California Zephyr&quot; between Oakland and Chicago via Denver and revived the &quot;Auto Train&quot;, a unique service that carries both passengers and their vehicles. Amtrak advertised it as a great way to avoid traffic along the I-95 running between Lorton, Virginia (near Washington, D.C.) and Sanford, Florida (near Orlando) on the Silver Star alignment.

In 1980s and 1990s, stations in Baltimore, Chicago, and Washington, D.C. received major rehabilitation and the Empire Connection tunnel opened in 1991, allowing Amtrak to consolidate all New York services at Penn Station. Despite the improvements, Amtrak&#x27;s ridership stagnated at roughly 20 million passengers per year, amid uncertain government aid from 1981 to about 2000.

In the early 1990s, Amtrak tested several different high-speed trains from Europe on the Northeast Corridor. An X 2000 train was leased from Sweden for test runs from October 1992 to January 1993, followed by revenue service between Washington, D.C. and New York City from February to May and August to September 1993. Siemens showed the ICE 1 train from Germany, organizing the ICE Train North America Tour which started to operate on the Northeast Corridor on July 3, 1993.

In 1993, Thomas Downs succeeded Claytor as Amtrak&#x27;s fifth president. The stated goal remained &quot;operational self-sufficiency&quot;. By this time, however, Amtrak had a large overhang of debt from years of underfunding. In the mid-1990s, Amtrak suffered through a serious cash crunch. Under Downs, Congress included a provision in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 that resulted in Amtrak receiving a $2.3 billion tax refund that resolved their cash crisis. However, Congress also instituted a &quot;glide path&quot; to financial self-sufficiency, excluding railroad retirement tax act payments.

George Warrington became the sixth president in 1998, with a mandate to make Amtrak financially self-sufficient. Under Warrington, the company tried to expand into express freight shipping, placing Amtrak in competition with the &quot;host&quot; freight railroads and the trucking industry.

On March 9, 1999, Amtrak unveiled its plan for the &quot;Acela Express,&quot; a high-speed train on the Northeast Corridor between Washington, D.C. and Boston. Several changes were made to the corridor to make it suitable for higher-speed electric trains. The Northend Electrification Project extended existing electrification from New Haven, Connecticut, to Boston to complete the overhead power supply along the route, and several grade crossings were improved or removed.

===2000s: Growth in the 21st century===

Ridership increased during the first decade of the 21st century after the implementation of capital improvements in the NEC and rises in automobile fuel costs. The inauguration of the high-speed &quot;Acela&quot; in late 2000 generated considerable publicity and led to major ridership gains. However, through the late 1990s and very early 21st century, Amtrak could not add sufficient express freight revenue or cut sufficient other expenditures to break even. By 2002, it was clear that Amtrak could not achieve self-sufficiency, but Congress continued to authorize funding and released Amtrak from the requirement. In early 2002, David L. Gunn replaced Warrington as seventh president. In a departure from his predecessors&#x27; promises to make Amtrak self-sufficient in the short term, Gunn argued that no form of passenger transportation in the United States is self-sufficient as the economy is currently structured. Highways, airports, and air traffic control &quot;all&quot; require large government expenditures to build and operate, coming from the Highway Trust Fund and Aviation Trust Fund paid for by user fees, highway fuel and road taxes, and, in the case of the General Fund, from general taxation. Gunn dropped most freight express business and worked to eliminate deferred maintenance.

A plan by the Bush administration &quot;to privatize parts of the national passenger rail system and spin off other parts to partial state ownership&quot; provoked disagreement within Amtrak&#x27;s board of directors. Late in 2005, Gunn was fired. Gunn&#x27;s replacement, Alexander Kummant (2006–08), was committed to operating a national rail network, and like Gunn, opposed the notion of putting the Northeast Corridor under separate ownership. He said that shedding the system&#x27;s long-distance routes would amount to selling national assets that are on par with national parks, and that Amtrak&#x27;s abandonment of these routes would be irreversible. In late 2006, Amtrak unsuccessfully sought annual congressional funding of $1 billion for ten years. In early 2007, Amtrak employed 20,000 people in 46 states and served 25 million passengers a year, its highest number since its founding in 1970. &quot;Politico&quot; noted a key problem: &quot;the rail system chronically operates in the red. A pattern has emerged: Congress overrides cutbacks demanded by the White House and appropriates enough funds to keep Amtrak from plunging into insolvency. But, Amtrak advocates say, that is not enough to fix the system&#x27;s woes.&quot;

Joseph H. Boardman replaced Kummant as president and CEO in late 2008.

In 2011, Amtrak announced its intention to improve and expand the high-speed rail corridor from Penn Station in NYC, under the Hudson River in new tunnels, and double-tracking the line to Newark, NJ, called the Gateway Program, initially estimated to cost $13.5 billion (equal to $ billion in ).

From May 2011 to May 2012, Amtrak celebrated its 40th anniversary with festivities across the country that started on National Train Day (May 7, 2011). A commemorative book entitled &quot;Amtrak: An American Story&quot; was published, a documentary was created, six locomotives were painted in Amtrak&#x27;s four prior paint schemes, and an Exhibit Train toured the country visiting 45 communities and welcoming more than 85,000 visitors.

After years of almost revolving-door CEOs at Amtrak, in December 2013, Boardman was named &quot;Railroader of the Year&quot; by &quot;Railway Age&quot; magazine, which noted that with over five years in the job, he is the second-longest serving head of Amtrak since it was formed more than 40 years ago. On December 9, 2015, Boardman announced in a letter to employees that he would be leaving Amtrak in September 2016. He had advised the Amtrak Board of Directors of his decision the previous week. On August 19, 2016, the Amtrak Board of Directors named former Norfolk Southern Railway President &amp; CEO Charles &quot;Wick&quot; Moorman as Boardman&#x27;s successor with an effective date of September 1, 2016. During his term, Moorman took no salary and said that he saw his role as one of a &quot;transitional CEO&quot; who would reorganize Amtrak before turning it over to new leadership.

On November 17, 2016, the Gateway Program Development Corporation (GDC) was formed for the purpose of overseeing and effectuating the rail infrastructure improvements known as the Gateway Program. GDC is a partnership of the States of New York and New Jersey and Amtrak. The Gateway Program includes the Hudson Tunnel Project, to build a new tunnel under the Hudson River and rehabilitate the existing century-old tunnel, and the Portal North Bridge, to replace a century-old moveable bridge with a modern structure that is less prone to failure. Later projects of the Gateway Program, including the expansion of track and platforms at Penn Station New York, construction of the Bergen Loop and other improvements will roughly double capacity for Amtrak and NJ Transit trains in the busiest, most complex section of the Northeast Corridor.

In June 2017, it was announced that former Delta and Northwest Airlines CEO Richard Anderson would become Amtrak&#x27;s next President &amp; CEO. Anderson began the job on July 12, assuming the title of President immediately and serving alongside Moorman as &quot;co-CEOs&quot; until the end of the year. On April 15, 2020, Atlas Air Chairman, President and CEO William Flynn was named Amtrak President and CEO. In addition to Atlas Air, Flynn has held senior roles at CSX Transportation, SeaLand Services and GeoLogistics Corp. Anderson would remain with Amtrak as a senior advisor until December 2020.

As Amtrak approached profitability in 2020, the company undertook planning to expand and create new intermediate-distance corridors across the country. Included were several new services in Ohio, Tennessee, Colorado, and Minnesota, among other states.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Amtrak continued operating as an essential service. It started requiring face coverings the week of May 17, and limited sales to 50% of capacity. Most long-distance routes were reduced to three weekly round trips in October 2020.

In March 2021, following President Joe Biden&#x27;s American Jobs Plan announcement, Amtrak CEO Bill Flynn outlined a proposal called Amtrak Connects US that would expand state-supported intercity corridors with an infusion of upfront capital assistance. This would expand service to cities including Las Vegas, Phoenix, Baton Rouge, Nashville, Chattanooga, Louisville, Columbus (Ohio), Wilmington (North Carolina), Cheyenne, Montgomery, Concord, and Scranton. Also in March 2021, Amtrak announced plans to return 12 of its long-distance routes to daily schedules later in the spring. Most of these routes were restored to daily service in late-May 2021. However, a resurgence of the virus caused by the Omicron variant caused Amtrak to modify and/or suspend many of these routes again from January to March 2022.

==Operations==

===Routes===

Amtrak is required by law to operate a national route system. Amtrak has presence in 46 of the 48 contiguous states, as well as the District of Columbia (with only thruway connecting services in Wyoming and no services in South Dakota). Amtrak services fall into three groups: short-haul service on the Northeast Corridor, state-supported short-haul service outside the Northeast Corridor, and medium- and long-haul service known within Amtrak as the National Network. Amtrak receives federal funding for the vast majority of its operations including the central spine of the Northeast Corridor as well as for its National Network routes. In addition to the federally funded routes, Amtrak partners with transportation agencies in 18 states to operate other short and medium-haul routes outside of the Northeast Corridor, some of which connect to it or are extensions from it. In addition to its inter-city services, Amtrak also operates commuter services under contract for three public agencies: the MARC Penn Line in Maryland, Shore Line East in Connecticut, and Metrolink in Southern California.

Service on the Northeast Corridor (NEC), between Boston, and Washington, D.C., as well as between Philadelphia and Harrisburg, is powered by overhead lines; for the rest of the system, diesel-fueled locomotives are used. Routes vary widely in the frequency of service, from three-days-a-week trains on the &quot;Sunset Limited&quot; to several times per hour on the Northeast Corridor. For areas not served by trains, Amtrak Thruway routes provide guaranteed connections to trains via buses, vans, ferries and other modes.

The most popular and heavily used services are those running on the NEC, including the &quot;Acela&quot; and &quot;Northeast Regional&quot;. The NEC runs between Boston and Washington, D.C. via New York City and Philadelphia. Some services continue into Virginia. The NEC services accounted for 4.4 million of Amtrak&#x27;s 12.2 million passengers in fiscal year 2021. Outside the NEC the most popular services are the short-haul corridors in California, the &quot;Pacific Surfliner&quot;, &quot;Capitol Corridor&quot;, and &quot;San Joaquins&quot;, which are supplemented by an extensive network of connecting buses. Together the California corridor trains accounted for a combined 2.35 million passengers in fiscal year 2021. Other popular routes include the &quot;Empire Service&quot; between New York City and Niagara Falls, via Albany and Buffalo, which carried 613.2 thousand passengers in fiscal year 2021, and the &quot;Keystone Service&quot; between New York City and Harrisburg via Philadelphia that carried 394.3 thousand passengers that same year.

Four of the six busiest stations by boardings are on the NEC: New York Penn Station (first), Washington Union Station (second), Philadelphia 30th Street Station (third), and Boston South Station (fifth). The other two are Chicago Union Station (fourth) and Los Angeles Union Station (sixth).

===On-time performance===
On-time performance is calculated differently for airlines than for Amtrak. A plane is considered on-time if it arrives within 15 minutes of the schedule. Amtrak uses a sliding scale, with trips under considered late if they are more than 10 minutes behind schedule, up to 30 minutes for trips over in length.

Outside the Northeast Corridor and stretches of track in Southern California and Michigan, most Amtrak trains run on tracks owned and operated by privately owned freight railroads. BNSF is the largest host to Amtrak routes, with 6.3 million train-miles. Freight rail operators are required under federal law to give dispatching preference to Amtrak trains. However, Amtrak has accused freight railroads of violating or skirting these regulations, resulting in passenger trains waiting for freight traffic to clear the track.

The railroads&#x27; dispatching practices were investigated in 2008, resulting in stricter laws about train priority. Subsequently, Amtrak&#x27;s overall on-time performance went up from 74.7% in fiscal 2008 to 84.7% in 2009, with long-distance trains and others outside the NEC seeing the greatest benefit. The &quot;Missouri River Runner&quot; jumped from 11% to 95%, becoming one of Amtrak&#x27;s best performers. The &quot;Texas Eagle&quot; went from 22.4% to 96.7%, and the &quot;California Zephyr&quot;, with a 5% on-time record in 2008, went up to 78.3%. However, this improved performance coincided with a general economic downturn, resulting in the lowest freight-rail traffic volumes since at least 1988, meaning less freight traffic to impede passenger traffic.

In 2018, Amtrak began issuing report cards, grading each host railroad similar to students, based on the railroad&#x27;s impact to on-time performance. The first report card, issued in March 2018, includes one A (given to Canadian Pacific) and two Fs (given to Canadian National and Norfolk Southern). Amtrak&#x27;s 2020 host report card gives Canadian Pacific and Canadian National an A, BNSF and CSX a B, Union Pacific a C+, and Norfolk Southern a D−. Amtrak&#x27;s 2023 host report card gives Canadian Pacific Kansas City an A, CSX and Canadian National a B+, BNSF a B, Norfolk Southern a B-, and Union Pacific a C-.

Amtrak&#x27;s median on-time performance between 2018 and 2023 was 74.5%, reaching a high of 80% in 2020. It was highest on the Northeast Corridor (81.3%). The vast majority of hours of delay, about 57.5% on average, were caused by the host railroad. Long-distance routes performed similarly to the total weighted on time percentage.

===Ridership===

Amtrak carried 15.8 million passengers in 1972, its first full year of operation. Ridership has increased steadily ever since, carrying a record 32 million passengers in fiscal year (FY) 2019, more than double the total in 1972. For the fiscal year ending on September 30, 2020, Amtrak reported 16.8 million passengers, with the decline resulting from effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. FY 2021 saw ridership decrease more, with 12.2 million passengers reported. FY 2022 saw an increase to 22.9 million passengers, further increasing to 28.6 million passengers in FY 2023. In FY 2024, Amtrak&#x27;s ridership increased to 32.8 million passengers, an all time record.

===Guest Rewards===
Amtrak&#x27;s loyalty program, Guest Rewards, is similar to the frequent-flyer programs of many airlines. Guest Rewards members accumulate points by riding Amtrak and through other activities, and can redeem these points for free Amtrak tickets and other rewards.

=== Rail passes ===
Amtrak offers the USA rail pass, valid for 10 segments (rides) in 30 days, and the California rail pass which is valid for 7 days of travel in a period of 21 days.

===Lines===
Along the NEC and in several other areas, Amtrak owns including 17 tunnels consisting of of track, and 1,186 bridges consisting of of track. In several places, primarily in New England, Amtrak leases tracks, providing track maintenance and controlling train movements. Most often, these tracks are leased from state, regional, or local governments. The lines are further divided into services. Amtrak owns and operates the following lines:

* Northeast Corridor: the Northeast Corridor between Washington, D.C., and Boston via Baltimore, Philadelphia, Newark, New York and Providence is largely owned by Amtrak (363 of 457 miles), working cooperatively with several state and regional commuter agencies. Between New Haven, Connecticut, and New Rochelle, New York, Northeast Corridor trains travel on the Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s New Haven Line, which is owned and operated by the Connecticut Department of Transportation and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
* Keystone Corridor: Amtrak owns the 104.2-mile line from Philadelphia to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. As a result of an investment partnership with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, signal and track improvements were completed in October 2006 that allow all-electric service with a top speed of to run along the corridor.
* Empire Corridor: Amtrak owns the between New York Penn Station and Spuyten Duyvil, New York. In 2012, Amtrak leased the between Poughkeepsie, New York, and Schenectady, New York, from owner CSX. In addition, Amtrak owns the tracks across the Whirlpool Rapids Bridge and short approach sections near it.
* Michigan Line: Amtrak acquired the 98 miles of Porter, Indiana to Kalamazoo, Michigan section of the former Michigan Central main line from Conrail in 1976.
* New Haven–Springfield Line: Amtrak purchased the between New Haven and Springfield from Penn Central in 1976.
* Post Road Branch: , Castleton-on-Hudson to Rensselaer, New York

In addition to these lines, Amtrak owns station and yard tracks in Chicago, Los Angeles, New Orleans, New York City, Oakland (Kirkham Street Yard), Orlando, Portland, Oregon, Seattle, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C. Amtrak leases station and yard tracks in Hialeah, near Miami, Florida, from the State of Florida.

Amtrak owns New York Penn Station, Philadelphia 30th Street Station, Baltimore Penn Station and Providence Station. It also owns Chicago Union Station, formerly through a wholly owned subsidiary, the Chicago Union Station Company until absorbed by Amtrak in 2017. Through the Washington Terminal Company, in which it owns a 99.7 percent interest, it owns the rail infrastructure around Washington Union Station. It holds a 99% interest in 30th Street Limited, a partnership responsible for redeveloping the area in and around 30th Street Station. Amtrak also owns Passenger Railroad Insurance.

=== Service lines ===
Amtrak organizes its business into six &quot;service lines&quot;, which are treated like divisions at most companies.

There are three operating service lines: Northeast Corridor, which operates Amtrak&#x27;s high-speed Acela and Northeast Regional trains; State Supported, which provides service on corridor routes of less than 750 miles and are funded entirely by state governments since 2008; and Long Distance, which operates routes over 750 miles and receives financial support from the federal government.

Additionally there are three service lines involved in activities other than operating Amtrak trains. They are: Ancillary, which includes operating commuter trains under contract, establishing Amtrak Thruway connecting services, operating charter trains, and hauling private railcars; Real Estate &amp; Commercial which manages property owned by Amtrak, including leasing space to other businesses inside stations; and Infrastructure Access/Reimbursable which charges other railroads for access to Amtrak owned tracks and performs work that can be reimbursed by other railroads or state governments. Net revenue generated by these service lines is used to fund Amtrak&#x27;s other operations.

==Rolling stock==
==On-board services==

===Classes of service===

Amtrak offers four classes of service: First Class, Sleeper Service, Business Class, and Coach Class:
* First Class: First Class service is only offered on the &quot;Acela&quot;. Seats are larger than those of Business Class and come in a variety of seating styles (single, facing singles with table, double, facing doubles with table and wheelchair accessible). First Class is located in a separate car from business class and is located at the end of the train (to reduce the number of passengers walking in the aisles). A car attendant provides passengers with hot towel service, a complimentary meal and alcoholic beverages. First Class passengers have access to lounges located at most larger stations.
* Sleeper Service: Private room accommodations on long-distance trains, including roomettes, bedrooms, bedroom suites, accessible bedrooms, and, on some trains, family bedrooms. Included in the price of a room are attendant service and on most routes, full hot meals. At night, attendants convert rooms into sleeping areas with fold-down beds and linens. Shower facilities with towels and bar soap are available. Complimentary juice, coffee and bottled water are included as well. Sleeper car passengers have access to all passenger facilities aboard the train. Sleeper Service passengers have access to lounges located at select stations.
* Business Class: Business Class seating is offered on the &quot;Acela&quot;, &quot;Northeast Regional&quot;, many short-haul corridor trains and some long-distance trains. It is the standard class of service on the &quot;Acela.&quot; On all other trains where it is offered, Business Class is located in a dedicated car or section of the train. While the specific features vary by route, many include extra legroom and complimentary non-alcoholic drinks. Seats in business class recline and feature a fold-down tray table, footrest, individual reading light, and power outlet. Passengers have access to some lounges, but busier locations may exclude Business Class customers.
* Coach Class: Coach Class is the standard class of service on all Amtrak trains except the &quot;Acela&quot;. Seats in coach recline and feature a fold-down tray table, footrest, individual reading light, and power outlet. Coach cars on long-distance trains are configured with fewer seats per car so that passengers have additional legroom and seats which are equipped with leg rests. Some corridor and short-distance trains have one coach car designated as a &quot;quiet car&quot; where loud conversation, phone calls, and sound played from electronic devices are not permitted.

===Wi-Fi and electronic services===
Amtrak first offered free Wi-Fi service to passengers aboard the &quot;Downeaster&quot; in 2008, the &quot;Acela&quot; and the &quot;Northeast Regional&quot; trains on the NEC in 2010, and the &quot;Amtrak Cascades&quot; in 2011. In February 2014, Amtrak rolled out Wi-Fi on corridor trains out of Chicago. When all the Midwest cars offer the AmtrakConnect service, about 85% of all Amtrak passengers nationwide will have Wi-Fi access. , most Amtrak passengers have access to free Wi-Fi. The service has developed a reputation for being unreliable and slow due to its cellular network connection; on some routes it is usually unusable, either freezing on the login page or, if it manages to log in, failing to provide any internet bandwidth.

Routes with Wi-Fi are typical on routes running east of the Mississippi River and the US Coastlines. West–east routes such as Sunset Limited, Southwest Chief and Texas Eagle notably lacks Wi-Fi whether through Amtrak or using a private hotspot, as cell towers are not common on the rail paths through desert and mountain wilderness.

Amtrak launched an e-ticketing system on the &quot;Downeaster&quot; in November 2011 and rolled it out nationwide on July 30, 2012. Amtrak officials said the system gives &quot;more accurate knowledge in realtime of who is on the train which greatly improves the safety and security of passengers; en route reporting of onboard equipment problems to mechanical crews which may result in faster resolution of the issue; and more efficient financial reporting&quot;.

===Baggage and cargo services===

Amtrak allows carry-on baggage on all routes; services with baggage cars allow checked baggage at selected stations. With the passage of the Wicker Amendment in 2010 passengers are allowed to put lawfully owned, unloaded firearms in checked Amtrak baggage, reversing a decade-long ban on such carriage.

The Amtrak Express cargo service provides small-package and less-than-truckload shipping between most Amtrak stations that handle checked baggage (over 100 cities). Cargo travels alongside checked luggage in baggage cars. Service and hours vary by station, limited by available equipment and staffing. Nearly all stations with checked baggage service can handle small packages, while large stations with forklifts can handle palletized shipments. Amtrak Express also offers station-to-station shipment of human remains to many cities.

Amtrak is popular among bicycle touring enthusiasts due to the ease of riding with a bike. In contrast to airlines, which require riders to dismantle their bicycles and place them in specialized bags, most Amtrak trains have onboard bike racks in either the coaches or checked baggage car. Bicycle reservations are required on most routes and cost up to $20.
==Labor issues==
In the modern era, Amtrak faces a number of important labor issues. As of 2023, the average Amtrak employee annual salary was $121,000 per year. In the area of pension funding, because of limitations originally imposed by Congress, most Amtrak workers were traditionally classified as &quot;railroad employees&quot; and contributions to the Railroad Retirement system have been made for those employees. However, because the size of the contributions is determined on an industry-wide basis rather than with reference to the employer for whom the employees work, some critics, such as the National Association of Railroad Passengers, maintain that Amtrak is subsidizing freight railroad pensions by as much as US$150 million/year.

In recent times, efforts at reforming passenger rail have addressed labor issues. In 1997 Congress released Amtrak from a prohibition on contracting for labor outside the corporation (and outside its unions), opening the door to privatization. Since that time, many of Amtrak&#x27;s employees have been working without a contract. The most recent contract, signed in 1999, was mainly retroactive.

Because of the fragmentation of railroad unions, Amtrak had 14 separate unions to negotiate with, including 24 separate contracts between them as of 2009. This makes it difficult to make substantial changes, in contrast to a situation where one union negotiates with one employer. Former Amtrak president Kummant followed a cooperative posture with Amtrak&#x27;s trade unions, ruling out plans to privatize large parts of Amtrak&#x27;s unionized workforce.

== Environmental impacts ==
=== Amtrak&#x27;s environmental impact ===
Per passenger mile, Amtrak is 30–40 percent more energy-efficient than commercial airlines and automobiles overall, though the exact figures for particular routes depend on load factor along with other variables. The electrified trains in the NEC are considerably more efficient than Amtrak&#x27;s diesels and can feed energy captured from regenerative braking back to the electrical grid. Passenger rail is also very competitive with other modes in terms of safety per mile.

In 2005, Amtrak&#x27;s carbon dioxide equivalent emissions per passenger were 0.411 lbs/mi (0.116 kg per km). For comparison, this is similar to a car with two people, about twice as high as the UK rail average (where more of the system is electrified), about four times the average US motorcoach, and about eight times a Finnish electric intercity train or fully loaded fifty-seat coach. It is, however, about two thirds of the raw CO2-equivalent emissions of a long-distance domestic flight.

Amtrak operates diesel, electric, and dual-mode (diesel and electric) locomotives on over thirty passenger train routes throughout the U.S. and Canada. Diesel-powered engines produce more greenhouse gas emissions during operation than electric trains.

As for the locational pollution directly from Amtrak operation, their diesel trains cause more regional air pollution, impacting the ecosystems around the sites of operation. Also, more stops along train routes can lead to higher greenhouse gas emissions. Amtrak rail facilities located in Delaware were cited as the state&#x27;s largest source of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contamination into the Delaware River, which build up in the tissue of animals and are human carcinogens.

=== Environmental impact on Amtrak ===
Amtrak railways and surrounding infrastructure are susceptible to degradation by natural causes over time. Railways experience water damage from climate change backed increases in rainfall in wet areas, and rail buckling caused by hotter and dryer seasons in naturally dry areas.

In September 2021, the remnants of Hurricane Ida flooded the Amtrak Northeast Corridor running from Boston to Washington D.C. and caused it to shut down for an entire day. In February 2023, heavy snowfall and debris on tracks caused major disruptions from delays to cancellations.

Rising summertime temperatures are causing an increase in railway buckles. A study conducted on the railways in the southeast United Kingdom found that when temperature changes become extreme in the summertime due to climate change, the tracks buckle due to the outward force of the metal expanding in collaboration with the weight of train car traffic. This causes speed restrictions to be put in place around certain temperature intervals, slowing travel time and lessening the number of train rides in a day. The study found that in 2004, 30,000 delay minutes were attributed to increased heat causing a total of over 1.7 million U.S. dollars, of total heat related delay cost.

==Public funding==

Amtrak receives annual appropriations from federal and state governments to supplement operating and capital programs.
===Funding history===

====1970s to 1990s====
Amtrak commenced operations in 1971 with $40 million in direct federal aid, $100 million in federally insured loans, and a somewhat larger private contribution. Officials expected that Amtrak would break even by 1974, but those expectations proved unrealistic and annual direct federal aid reached a 17-year high in 1981 of $1.25 billion. During the Reagan administration, appropriations were halved and by 1986, federal support fell to a decade low of $601 million, almost none of which were capital appropriations. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Congress continued the reductionist trend even while Amtrak expenses held steady or rose. Amtrak was forced to borrow to meet short-term operating needs, and by 1995 Amtrak was on the brink of a cash crisis and was unable to continue to service its debts. In response, in 1997 Congress authorized $5.2 billion for Amtrak over the next five years – largely to complete the &quot;Acela&quot; capital project – on the condition that Amtrak submit to the ultimatum of self-sufficiency by 2003 or liquidation. While Amtrak made financial improvements during this period, it did not achieve self-sufficiency.

====2000s====
In 2004, a stalemate in federal support of Amtrak forced cutbacks in services and routes as well as the resumption of deferred maintenance. In fiscal 2004 and 2005, Congress appropriated about $1.2 billion for Amtrak, $300 million more than President George W. Bush had requested. However, the company&#x27;s board requested $1.8 billion through fiscal 2006, the majority of which (about $1.3 billion) would be used to bring infrastructure, rolling stock, and motive power back to a state of good repair. In Congressional testimony, the DOT Inspector General confirmed that Amtrak would need at least $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion in fiscal 2006 and $2 billion in fiscal 2007 just to maintain the status quo. In 2006, Amtrak received just under $1.4 billion, with the condition that Amtrak would reduce (but not eliminate) food and sleeper service losses. Thus, dining service was simplified and now requires two fewer on-board service workers. Only &quot;Auto Train&quot; and &quot;Empire Builder&quot; services continue regular made-on-board meal service. In 2010 the Senate approved a bill to provide $1.96 billion to Amtrak, but cut the approval for high-speed rail to a $1 billion appropriation.

State governments have partially filled the breach left by reductions in federal aid. Several states have entered into operating partnerships with Amtrak, notably California, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Michigan, Oregon, Missouri, Washington, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Texas, Wisconsin, Vermont, Maine, and New York, as well as the Canadian province of British Columbia, which provides some of the resources for the operation of the &quot;Cascades&quot; route.

With the dramatic rise in gasoline prices during 2007–08, Amtrak saw record ridership. Capping a steady five-year increase in ridership overall, regional lines saw 12% year-over-year growth in May 2008. In October 2007, the Senate passed S. 294, the Passenger Rail Improvement and Investment Act of 2007 (70–22), sponsored by Senators Frank Lautenberg and Trent Lott. Despite a veto threat by President Bush, a similar bill passed the House on June 11, 2008, with a veto-proof margin (311–104). The final bill, spurred on by the September 12 Metrolink collision in California and retitled Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008, was signed into law by President Bush on October 16, 2008. The bill appropriates $2.6 billion a year in Amtrak funding through 2013.

====2010s====
Amtrak points out that in 2010, its farebox recovery (percentage of operating costs covered by revenues generated by passenger fares) was 79%, the highest reported for any U.S. passenger railroad. This increased to 94.9% in 2018.

Amtrak has argued that it needs to increase capital program costs in 2013 in order to replace old train equipment because the multi-year maintenance costs for those trains exceed what it would cost to simply buy new equipment that would not need to be repaired for several years. However, despite an initial request for more than $2.1 billion in funding for the year, the company had to deal with a year-over-year cut in 2013 federal appropriations, dropping to under $1.4 billion for the first time in several years. Amtrak stated in 2010 that the backlog of needed repairs of the track it owns on the Northeast Corridor included over 200 bridges, most dating to the 19th century, tunnels under Baltimore dating to the American Civil War era and functionally obsolete track switches which would cost $5.2 billion to repair (more than triple Amtrak&#x27;s total annual budget). Amtrak&#x27;s budget is only allocated on a yearly basis, and it has been argued by Joseph Vranich that this makes multi-year development programs and long-term fiscal planning difficult if not impossible.

In Fiscal Year 2011, the U.S. Congress granted Amtrak $563 million for operating and $922 million for capital programs.

====2020s====
In 2021, the 117th United States Congress passed and President Joe Biden signed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which directly appropriated $66 billion for rail over a five-year period, of which at least $18 billion is designated for expanding passenger rail service to new corridors, and it authorized an additional $36 billion. Amtrak received $22 billion in advance appropriations and $19 billion in fully authorized funds.

===Controversy===
Government aid to Amtrak was controversial from the beginning. The formation of Amtrak in 1971 was criticized as a bailout serving corporate rail interests and union railroaders, not the traveling public. Critics have asserted that Amtrak has proven incapable of operating as a business and that it does not provide valuable transportation services meriting public support, a &quot;mobile money-burning machine&quot;. Many fiscal conservatives have argued that subsidies should be ended, national rail service terminated, and the NEC turned over to private interests. Critics also question Amtrak&#x27;s energy efficiency, though the U.S. Department of Energy considers Amtrak among the most energy-efficient forms of transportation.

The Rail Passenger Service Act of 1970, which established Amtrak, specifically states that, &quot;The Corporation will not be an agency or establishment of the United States Government&quot;. Then common stock was issued in 1971 to railroads that contributed capital and equipment; these shares convey almost no benefits, but their holders declined a 2002 buy-out offer by Amtrak. There are currently 109.4 million shares of preferred stock, at a par value of $100 per share, all held by the US government. As of February 2015, there were 9.4 million shares of common stock, with a par value of $10 per share, held by American Premier Underwriters (53%), BNSF (35%), Canadian Pacific (7%) and Canadian National (5%).

==Leadership==

In addition to the United States Secretary of Transportation and its CEO, Amtrak&#x27;s Board of Directors has eight presidentially-nominated and senate-confirmed seats. Presidentially-appointed members serve nominally five-year terms but are allowed to serve until their successor is confirmed, and no more than five of the eight may belong to one political party. Of the eight presidentially-appointed members, a minimum of two must and maximum of four may reside along or near the Northeast Corridor (defined as Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island), while the other four to six must reside in a state served by an Amtrak-operated long-distance or state-supported route outside of the Northeast Corridor. At least one of these eight must be an individual with a disability.

The Secretary may be represented at Board meetings by their designee.

<doc id="51929" wikidata="Q131159" url="?curid=51929" title="Pope Fabian">
<text>Pope Fabian () was the bishop of Rome from 10 January 236 until his death on 20 January 250, succeeding Anterus. A dove is said to have descended on his head to mark him as the Holy Spirit&#x27;s unexpected choice to become the next pope. He was succeeded by Cornelius.

Most of his papacy was characterized by amicable relations with the imperial government, and the schism between the Roman congregations of Pontian and Hippolytus was ended. He divided Rome into diaconates and appointed secretaries to collect the records of the martyrs. He sent out seven &quot;apostles to the Gauls&quot; as missionaries, but probably did not baptize Emperor Philip the Arab as is alleged. He died a martyr at the beginning of the Decian persecution and is venerated as a saint by the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church.

==Early life and accession==
According to the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot;, Fabian was a noble Roman by birth, and his father&#x27;s name was Fabius. Nothing more is known about his background. The legend concerning the circumstances of his election is preserved by the fourth-century writer Eusebius of Caesarea (&quot;Church History&quot;, VI. 29). One authority refers to him as &quot;Flavian&quot;.

After the short reign of Pope Anterus, Fabian had come to Rome from the countryside when the new papal election began. &quot;Although present&quot;, says Eusebius, Fabian &quot;was in the mind of none&quot;. While the names of several illustrious and noble churchmen were being considered over the course of thirteen days, a dove suddenly descended upon the head of Fabian. To the assembled electors, this strange sight recalled the gospel scene of the descent of the Holy Spirit on Jesus at the time of his baptism by John the Baptist. The congregation took this as a sign that he was marked out for this dignity, and Fabian was at once proclaimed bishop by acclamation.

==Papacy==
During Fabian&#x27;s reign of 14 years, there was a lull in the persecution which had resulted in the exile of both Anterus&#x27; predecessor Pontian and the antipope (and later saint) Hippolytus. Fabian had enough influence at court to effect the return of the bodies of both of these martyrs from Sardinia, where they had died at hard labor in the mines. The report that he baptized the emperor Philip the Arab and his son, however, is probably a legend, although he did seem to enjoy some connections at court, since the bodies of Pontian and Hippolytus could not have been exhumed without the emperor&#x27;s approval.

According to the sixth-century historian and hagiographer Gregory of Tours Fabian sent out the &quot;apostles to the Gauls&quot; to Christianise Gaul in A.D. 245. Fabian sent seven bishops from Rome to Gaul to preach the Gospel: Gatianus of Tours to Tours, Trophimus of Arles to Arles, Paul of Narbonne to Narbonne, Saturnin to Toulouse, Denis to Paris, Austromoine to Clermont, and Martial to Limoges. He also condemned Privatus, the originator of a new heresy in Africa.

The &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot; says that Fabian divided the Christian communities of Rome into seven districts, each supervised by a deacon. Eusebius (VI §43) adds that he appointed seven subdeacons to help collect the &quot;acta&quot; of the martyrs—the reports of the court proceedings on the occasion of their trials. There is also a tradition that he instituted the four minor clerical orders: porter, lector, exorcist, and acolyte. However most scholars believe these offices evolved gradually and were formally instituted at a later date.

His deeds are thus described in the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot;: 
He divided the &quot;regiones&quot; into deaconships and made seven sub-deaconships which seven secretaries oversaw, so that they brought together the deeds of the martyrs faithfully made whole, and he brought forth many works in the cemeteries.

The &quot;Liberian Catalogue&quot; of the popes also reports that Fabian initiated considerable work on the catacombs, where honored Christians were interred, and where he also caused the body of Pontian to be entombed at the catacomb of Callixtus.

==Martyrdom and legacy==
With the ascension of Emperor Decius, the Roman government&#x27;s tolerant policy toward Christianity temporarily ended. Decius ordered everyone in the Empire, with the exception of Jews, to demonstrate loyalty to Rome by offering incense to the cult images of deities that represented the Roman state. This was unacceptable to many Christians, who, while no longer obeying most of the laws of the Old Testament, took the commandment against idolatry seriously. Fabian was one of the earliest victims of Decius, dying as a martyr on 20 January 250, at the beginning of the Decian persecution, though probably in prison, rather than by execution.

Fabian was interred in the catacomb of Callixtus in Rome. The Greek inscription on his tomb has survived, and bears the words: &quot;Fabian, Bishop, Martyr&quot;. Fabian&#x27;s remains were later reinterred at San Sebastiano fuori le mura by Pope Clement XI where the Albani Chapel is dedicated in his honour.

Fabian&#x27;s feast day is commemorated on 20 January in the Catholic Church, the same as Saint Sebastian. Fabian&#x27;s feast day in the Eastern Orthodox Church is 5 August, and in Coptic Christianity it is 7 and 11 Meshir. The church of Santi Fabiano e Venanzio a Villa Fiorelli (1936) in Rome is named in his honour, and also in that of Saint Venantius of Camerino who died in the same persecutions.

Fabian was highly esteemed by Cyprian. Cyprian&#x27;s letter to Fabian&#x27;s successor, Cornelius, calls him &quot;incomparable&quot; and says that the glory of his martyrdom answered the purity and holiness of his life (Cyprian, &quot;Epistle&quot; 30). Novatian refers to his &quot;nobilissima memoriae&quot;, and he corresponded with Origen.

Fabian is honored on the liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America on 20 January.

<text>A kinetic energy penetrator (KEP), also known as long-rod penetrator (LRP), is a type of ammunition designed to penetrate vehicle armour using a flechette-like, high-sectional density projectile. Like a bullet or kinetic energy weapon, this type of ammunition does not contain explosive payloads and uses purely kinetic energy to penetrate the target. Modern KEP munitions are typically of the armour-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot (APFSDS) type.

==History==

Early cannons fired kinetic energy ammunition, initially consisting of heavy balls of worked stone and later of dense metals. From the beginning, combining high muzzle energy with projectile weight and hardness have been the foremost factors in the design of such weapons. Similarly, the foremost purpose of such weapons has generally been to defeat protective shells of armored vehicles or other defensive structures, whether it is stone walls, sailship timbers, or modern tank armour. Kinetic energy ammunition, in its various forms, has consistently been the choice for those weapons due to the highly focused terminal ballistics.

The development of the modern KE penetrator combines two aspects of artillery design, high muzzle velocity and concentrated force. High muzzle velocity is achieved by using a projectile with a low mass and large base area in the gun barrel. Firing a small-diameter projectile wrapped in a lightweight outer shell, called a sabot, raises the muzzle velocity. Once the shell clears the barrel, the sabot is no longer needed and falls off in pieces. This leaves the projectile traveling at high velocity with a smaller cross-sectional area and reduced aerodynamic drag during the flight to the target (see external ballistics and terminal ballistics). Germany developed modern sabots under the name &quot;treibspiegel&quot; (&quot;thrust mirror&quot;) to give extra altitude to its anti-aircraft guns during the Second World War. Before this, primitive wooden sabots had been used for centuries in the form of a wooden plug attached to or breech loaded before cannonballs in the barrel, placed between the propellant charge and the projectile. The name &quot;sabot&quot; (pronounced in English usage) is the French word for clog (a wooden shoe traditionally worn in some European countries).

Concentration of force into a smaller area was initially attained by replacing the single metal (usually steel) shot with a composite shot using two metals, a heavy core (based on tungsten) inside a lighter metal outer shell. These designs were known as armour-piercing composite rigid (APCR) by the British, high-velocity armor-piercing (HVAP) by the US, and &quot;hartkern&quot; (hard core) by the Germans. On impact, the core had a much more concentrated effect than plain metal shot of the same weight and size. The air resistance and other effects were the same as for the shell of identical size. High-velocity armor-piercing (HVAP) rounds were primarily used by tank destroyers in the US Army and were relatively uncommon as the tungsten core was expensive and prioritized for other applications.

Between 1941 and 1943, the British combined the two techniques in the armour-piercing discarding sabot (APDS) round. The sabot replaced the outer metal shell of the APCR. While in the gun, the shot had a large base area to get maximum acceleration from the propelling charge but once outside, the sabot fell away to reveal a heavy shot with a small cross-sectional area. APDS rounds served as the primary kinetic energy weapon of most tanks during the early-Cold War period, though they suffered the primary drawback of inaccuracy. This was resolved with the introduction of the armour-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot (APFSDS) round during the 1970s, which added stabilising fins to the penetrator, greatly increasing accuracy.

==Design==
The principle of the kinetic energy penetrator is that it uses its kinetic energy, which is a function of its mass and velocity, to force its way through armor. If the armor is defeated, the heat and spalling (particle spray) generated by the penetrator going through the armor, and the pressure wave that develops, ideally destroys the target.

The modern kinetic energy weapon maximizes the stress (kinetic energy divided by impact area) delivered to the target by:
* maximizing the mass – that is, using the densest metals practical, which is one of the reasons depleted uranium or tungsten carbide is often used – and muzzle velocity of the projectile, as kinetic energy scales with the mass &quot;m&quot; and the square of the velocity &quot;v&quot; of the projectile formula_1
* minimizing the width, since if the projectile does not tumble, it will hit the target face first. As most modern projectiles have circular cross-sectional areas, their impact area will scale with the square of the radius &quot;r&quot; (the impact area being formula_2)

The penetrator length plays a large role in determining the ultimate depth of penetration. Generally, a penetrator is incapable of penetrating deeper than its own length, as the sheer stress of impact and perforation ablates it. This has led to the current designs which resemble a long metal arrow.

For monobloc penetrators made of a single material, a perforation formula devised by Wili Odermatt and W. Lanz can calculate the penetration depth of an APFSDS round.

In 1982, an analytical investigation drawing from concepts of gas dynamics and experiments on target penetration led to the conclusion on the efficiency of impactors that penetration is deeper using unconventional three-dimensional shapes.

<text>Martin John Dunwoody (born 3 November 1938) is an emeritus professor of Mathematics at the University of Southampton, England.

He earned his PhD in 1964 from the Australian National University. He held positions at the University of Sussex before becoming a professor at the University of Southampton in 1992. He has been emeritus professor since 2003.

Dunwoody works on geometric group theory and low-dimensional topology. He is a leading expert in splittings and accessibility of discrete groups, groups acting on graphs and trees, JSJ-decompositions, the topology of 3-manifolds and the structure of their fundamental groups.

Since 1971 several mathematicians have been working on Wall&#x27;s conjecture, posed by Wall in a 1971 paper, which said that all finitely generated groups are accessible. Roughly, this means that every finitely generated group can be constructed from finite and one-ended groups via a finite number of amalgamated free products and HNN extensions over finite subgroups. In view of the Stallings theorem about ends of groups, one-ended groups are precisely those finitely generated infinite groups that cannot be decomposed nontrivially as amalgamated products or HNN-extensions over finite subgroups.
Dunwoody proved the Wall conjecture for finitely presented groups in 1985. In 1991 he finally disproved Wall&#x27;s conjecture by finding a finitely generated group that is not accessible.

Dunwoody found a graph-theoretic proof of Stallings&#x27; theorem about ends of groups in 1982, by constructing certain tree-like automorphism invariant graph decompositions. This work has been developed to an important theory in the book &quot;Groups acting on graphs&quot;, Cambridge University Press, 1989, with Warren Dicks. In 2002 Dunwoody put forward a proposed proof of the Poincaré conjecture. The proof generated considerable interest among mathematicians, but a mistake was quickly discovered and the proof was withdrawn. The conjecture was later proven by Grigori Perelman, following the program of Richard S. Hamilton.

<text>Hymenomycetes was formerly the largest taxonomic group of fungi within the division Basidiomycota, but the term is no longer taxonomically relevant. Many familiar fungi belong to this class, including bracket fungi and toadstools. This class contained the orders Agaricales, Boletales, and Russulales.

The erstwhile class, now understood to be a polyphyletic assemblage of basidiomycetes, refers to fungi with fruit bodies whose hymenophore develops in an exposed manner, or only with a veil (velum). These forms are termed gymnocarpic or hemiangiocarpic ontogeny, respectively. A contrasting example of hymenophore development is the puffballs, which undergo gasterocarpic development (hymenophore enclosed).

<text>A waveplate or retarder is an optical device that alters the polarization state of a light wave travelling through it. Two common types of waveplates are the &quot;half-wave plate&quot;, which rotates the polarization direction of linearly polarized light, and the &quot;quarter-wave plate&quot;, which converts between different elliptical polarizations (such as the special case of converting from linearly polarized light to circularly polarized light and vice versa.)

Waveplates are constructed out of a birefringent material (such as quartz or mica, or even plastic), for which the index of refraction is different for light linearly polarized along one or the other of two certain perpendicular crystal axes. The behavior of a waveplate (that is, whether it is a half-wave plate, a quarter-wave plate, etc.) depends on the thickness of the crystal, the wavelength of light, and the variation of the index of refraction. By appropriate choice of the relationship between these parameters, it is possible to introduce a controlled phase shift between the two polarization components of a light wave, thereby altering its polarization. With an engineered combination of two birefringent materials, an achromatic waveplate can be manufactured such that the spectral response of its phase retardance can be nearly flat.

A common use of waveplates—particularly the sensitive-tint (full-wave) and quarter-wave plates—is in optical mineralogy. Addition of plates between the polarizers of a petrographic microscope makes the optical identification of minerals in thin sections of rocks easier, in particular by allowing deduction of the shape and orientation of the optical indicatrices within the visible crystal sections. This alignment can allow discrimination between minerals which otherwise appear very similar in plane polarized and cross polarized light.

== Principles of operation ==

A waveplate works by shifting the phase between two perpendicular polarization components of the light wave. A typical waveplate is simply a birefringent crystal with a carefully chosen orientation and thickness. The crystal is cut into a plate, with the orientation of the cut chosen so that the optic axis of the crystal is parallel to the surfaces of the plate. This results in two axes in the plane of the cut: the &quot;ordinary axis&quot;, with index of refraction &quot;n&quot;o, and the &quot;extraordinary axis&quot;, with index of refraction &quot;n&quot;e. The ordinary axis is perpendicular to the optic axis. The extraordinary axis is parallel to the optic axis. For a light wave normally incident upon the plate, the polarization component along the ordinary axis travels through the crystal with a speed &quot;v&quot;o = &quot;c&quot;/&quot;n&quot;o, while the polarization component along the extraordinary axis travels with a speed &quot;v&quot;e = &quot;c&quot;/&quot;n&quot;e. This leads to a phase difference between the two components as they exit the crystal. When &quot;n&quot;e &lt; &quot;n&quot;o, as in calcite, the extraordinary axis is called the &quot;fast axis&quot; and the ordinary axis is called the &quot;slow axis&quot;. For &quot;n&quot;e &gt; &quot;n&quot;o the situation is reversed.

Depending on the thickness of the crystal, light with polarization components along both axes will emerge in a different polarization state. The waveplate is characterized by the amount of relative phase, Γ, that it imparts on the two components, which is related to the birefringence Δ&quot;n&quot; and the thickness &quot;L&quot; of the crystal by the formula

:formula_1

where λ0 is the vacuum wavelength of the light.

Waveplates in general, as well as polarizers, can be described using the Jones matrix formalism, which uses a vector to represent the polarization state of light and a matrix to represent the linear transformation of a waveplate or polarizer.

Although the birefringence Δ&quot;n&quot; may vary slightly due to dispersion, this is negligible compared to the variation in phase difference according to the wavelength of the light due to the fixed path difference (λ0 in the denominator in the above equation). Waveplates are thus manufactured to work for a particular range of wavelengths. The phase variation can be minimized by stacking two waveplates that differ by a tiny amount in thickness back-to-back, with the slow axis of one along the fast axis of the other. With this configuration, the relative phase imparted can be, for the case of a quarter-wave plate, one-fourth a wavelength rather than three-fourths or one-fourth plus an integer. This is called a &quot;zero-order waveplate&quot;.

For a single waveplate changing the wavelength of the light introduces a linear error in the phase. Tilt of the waveplate enters via a factor of 1/cos θ (where θ is the angle of tilt) into the path length and thus only quadratically into the phase. For the extraordinary polarization the tilt also changes the refractive index to the ordinary via a factor of cos θ, so combined with the path length, the phase shift for the extraordinary light due to tilt is zero.

A polarization-independent phase shift of zero order needs a plate with thickness of one wavelength.
For calcite the refractive index changes in the first decimal place, so that a true zero order plate is ten times as thick as one wavelength.
For quartz and magnesium fluoride the refractive index changes in the second decimal place and true zero order plates are common for wavelengths above 1 μm.

== Plate types ==

=== Half-wave plate ===

For a half-wave plate, the relationship between &quot;L&quot;, Δ&quot;n&quot;, and λ0 is chosen so that the phase shift between polarization components is Γ = π. Now suppose a linearly polarized wave with polarization vector formula_2 is incident on the crystal. Let θ denote the angle between formula_2 and formula_4, where formula_4 is the vector along the waveplate&#x27;s fast axis. Let &quot;z&quot; denote the propagation axis of the wave. The electric field of the incident wave is
formula_6
where formula_7 lies along the waveplate&#x27;s slow axis. The effect of the half-wave plate is to introduce a phase shift term e&quot;i&quot;Γ = e&quot;i&quot;π = −1 between the &quot;f&quot; and &quot;s&quot; components of the wave, so that upon exiting the crystal the wave is now given by
formula_8
If formula_9 denotes the polarization vector of the wave exiting the waveplate, then this expression shows that the angle between formula_9 and formula_4 is −θ. Evidently, the effect of the half-wave plate is to mirror the wave&#x27;s polarization vector through the plane formed by the vectors formula_4 and formula_13. For linearly polarized light, this is equivalent to saying that the effect of the half-wave plate is to rotate the polarization vector through an angle 2θ; however, for elliptically polarized light the half-wave plate also has the effect of inverting the light&#x27;s handedness.

=== Quarter-wave plate ===
For a quarter-wave plate, the relationship between &quot;L&quot;, Δ&quot;n&quot;, and λ0 is chosen so that the phase shift between polarization components is Γ = π/2. Now suppose a linearly polarized wave is incident on the crystal. This wave can be written as
:formula_14
where the &quot;f&quot; and &quot;s&quot; axes are the quarter-wave plate&#x27;s fast and slow axes, respectively, the wave propagates along the &quot;z&quot; axis, and &quot;Ef&quot; and &quot;Es&quot; are real. The effect of the quarter-wave plate is to introduce a phase shift term e&quot;i&quot;Γ =e&quot;i&quot;π/2 = &quot;i&quot; between the &quot;f&quot; and &quot;s&quot; components of the wave, so that upon exiting the crystal the wave is now given by
:formula_15
The wave is now elliptically polarized.

If the axis of polarization of the incident wave is chosen so that it makes a 45° with the fast and slow axes of the waveplate, then &quot;Ef&quot; = &quot;Es&quot; ≡ &quot;E&quot;, and the resulting wave upon exiting the waveplate is
:formula_16
and the wave is circularly polarized.

If the axis of polarization of the incident wave is chosen so that it makes a 0° with the fast or slow axes of the waveplate, then the polarization will not change, so remains linear. If the angle is in between 0° and 45° the resulting wave has an elliptical polarization.

A circulating polarization can be visualized as the sum of two linear polarizations with a phase difference of 90°. The output depends on the polarization of the input. Suppose polarization axes x and y parallel with the slow and fast axis of the waveplate:

The polarization of the incoming photon (or beam) can be resolved as two polarizations on the x and y axis. If the input polarization is parallel to the fast or slow axis, then there is no polarization of the other axis, so the output polarization is the same as the input (only the phase more or less delayed). If the input polarization is 45° to the fast and slow axis, the polarization on those axes are equal. But the phase of the output of the slow axis will be delayed 90° with the output of the fast axis. If not the amplitude but both sine values are displayed, then x and y combined will describe a circle. With other angles than 0° or 45° the values in fast and slow axis will differ and their resultant output will describe an ellipse.

=== Full-wave, or sensitive-tint plate ===
A full-wave plate introduces a phase difference of exactly one wavelength between the two polarization directions, for one wavelength of light. In optical mineralogy, it is common to use a full-wave plate designed for green light (a wavelength near 540 nm). Linearly polarized white light which passes through the plate becomes elliptically polarized, except for that green light wavelength, which will remain linear. If a linear polarizer oriented perpendicular to the original polarization is added, this green wavelength is fully extinguished but elements of the other colors remain. This means that under these conditions the plate will appear an intense shade of red-violet, sometimes known as &quot;sensitive tint&quot;. This gives rise to this plate&#x27;s alternative names, the &quot;sensitive-tint plate&quot; or (less commonly) &quot;red-tint plate&quot;. These plates are widely used in mineralogy to aid in identification of minerals in thin sections of rocks.

=== Multiple-order vs. zero-order waveplates ===
A multiple-order waveplate is made from a single birefringent crystal that produces an integer multiple of the rated retardance (for example, a multiple-order half-wave plate may have an absolute retardance of 37λ/2). By contrast, a zero-order waveplate produces exactly the specified retardance. This can be accomplished by combining two multiple-order wave plates such that the difference in their retardances yields the net (true) retardance of the waveplate. Zero-order waveplates are less sensitive to temperature and wavelength shifts, but are more expensive than multiple-order ones.

Stacking a series of different-order waveplates with polarization filters between them yields a Lyot filter. Either the filters can be rotated, or the waveplates can be replaced with liquid crystal layers, to obtain a widely tunable pass band in optical transmission spectrum.

== Use in mineralogy and optical petrology ==

The sensitive-tint (full-wave) and quarter-wave plates are widely used in the field of optical mineralogy. Addition of plates between the polarizers of a petrographic microscope makes easier the optical identification of minerals in thin sections of rocks, in particular by allowing deduction of the shape and orientation of the optical indicatrices within the visible crystal sections.

In practical terms, the plate is inserted between the perpendicular polarizers at an angle of 45 degrees. This allows two different procedures to be carried out to investigate the mineral under the crosshairs of the microscope. Firstly, in ordinary cross polarized light, the plate can be used to distinguish the orientation of the optical indicatrix relative to crystal elongation – that is, whether the mineral is &quot;length slow&quot; or &quot;length fast&quot; – based on whether the visible interference colors increase or decrease by one order when the plate is added. Secondly, a slightly more complex procedure allows for a tint plate to be used in conjunction with interference figure techniques to allow measurement of the &quot;optic angle&quot; of the mineral. The optic angle (often notated as &quot;2V&quot;) can both be diagnostic of mineral type, as well as in some cases revealing information about the variation of chemical composition within a single mineral type.

<doc id="51944" wikidata="Q1195643" url="?curid=51944" title="Dichroism">
<text>In optics, a dichroic material is either one which causes visible light to be split up into distinct beams of different wavelengths (colours) (not to be confused with dispersion), or one in which light rays having different polarizations are absorbed by different amounts.

==In beam splitters==

The original meaning of &quot;dichroic&quot;, from the Greek &quot;dikhroos&quot;, two-coloured, refers to any optical device which can split a beam of light into two beams with differing wavelengths. Such devices include mirrors and filters, usually treated with optical coatings, which are designed to reflect light over a certain range of wavelengths and transmit light which is outside that range. An example is the dichroic prism, used in some camcorders, which uses several coatings to split light into red, green and blue components for recording on separate CCD arrays, however it is now more common to have a Bayer filter to filter individual pixels on a single CCD array. This kind of dichroic device does not usually depend on the polarization of the light. The term &quot;dichromatic&quot; is also used in this sense.

==With polarized light==

The second meaning of &quot;dichroic&quot; refers to the property of a material, in which light in different polarization states traveling through it experiences a different absorption coefficient; this is also known as diattenuation. When the polarization states in question are right and left-handed circular polarization, it is then known as circular dichroism (CD). Most materials exhibiting CD are chiral, although non-chiral materials showing CD have been recently observed. Since the left- and right-handed circular polarizations represent two spin angular momentum (SAM) states, in this case for a photon, this dichroism can also be thought of as spin angular momentum dichroism and could be modelled using quantum mechanics.

In some crystals, such as tourmaline, the strength of the dichroic effect varies strongly with the wavelength of the light, making them appear to have different colours when viewed with light having differing polarizations. This is more generally referred to as pleochroism, and the technique can be used in mineralogy to identify minerals. In some materials, such as herapathite (iodoquinine sulfate) or Polaroid sheets, the effect is not strongly dependent on wavelength.

===In liquid crystals===
Dichroism, in the second meaning above, occurs in liquid crystals due to either the optical anisotropy of the molecular structure or the presence of impurities or the presence of dichroic dyes. The latter is also called a &quot;guest–host effect&quot;.

<text>Alexander Whitelaw Robertson Trocchi ( ; 30 July 1925 – 15 April 1984) was a Scottish novelist.

==Early life and career==
Trocchi was born in Glasgow to Alfred (formerly Alfredo) Trocchi, a music-hall performer of Italian parentage, and Annie (née Robertson), who ran a boarding house and died of food poisoning when Trocchi was a teenager. He attended Hillhead High School in the city and Cally House School in Gatehouse of Fleet, having been evacuated there during World War II. After working as a seaman on the Murmansk convoys, he studied English Literature and Moral Philosophy at the University of Glasgow, and was awarded second-class honours in 1950. 

Without graduating, Trocchi obtained a travelling grant that enabled him to relocate to continental Europe. In the early 1950s he lived in Paris and edited the literary magazine &quot;Merlin&quot;, which published Henry Miller, Samuel Beckett, Christopher Logue, and Pablo Neruda, amongst others. Although not published in &quot;Merlin&quot;, American writer Terry Southern, who lived in Paris from 1948 to 1952, became a close friend of both Trocchi and his colleague Richard Seaver, and the three later co-edited the anthology &quot;Writers In Revolt&quot; (1962). Though &quot;Merlin&quot; had been established somewhat in rivalry with the &quot;Paris Review&quot;, George Plimpton also had served on the magazine&#x27;s editorial board. Trocchi claimed that this journal came to an end when the US State Department cancelled its many subscriptions in protest over an article by Jean-Paul Sartre praising the homoeroticism of Jean Genet.

Maurice Girodias published most of Trocchi&#x27;s novels through Olympia Press, often written under pen names, such as Frances Lengel and Carmencita de las Lunas. Girodias also published &quot;My Life and Loves: Fifth Volume&quot;, which purported to be the final volume of the autobiography of Irish-American writer Frank Harris. However, though based on autobiographical material by Harris, the book was heavily edited and rewritten by Trocchi. Girodias subsequently commissioned Trocchi to write erotica along with his friends and Merlin associates Logue, Plimpton and John Stevenson. Under the name Frances Lengel, he churned out numerous pornographic books including the now classic &quot;Helen and Desire&quot; (1954) and a dirty version of his own book &quot;Young Adam&quot; (1954). Trocchi and his friends also published Samuel Beckett&#x27;s &quot;War and Memory&quot; and Jean Genet&#x27;s &quot;Thief&#x27;s journal&quot; in English for the first time.

==Drug addiction==
Trocchi acquired his lifelong heroin addiction in Paris. He left Paris for the United States and spent time in Taos, New Mexico, before settling in New York City, where he worked on a stone scow on the Hudson River. This time is chronicled in the novel &quot;Cain&#x27;s Book&quot;, which at the time became something of a sensation, being an honest study of heroin addiction with descriptions of sex and drug use that got it banned in Britain, where the book was the subject of an obscenity trial. In the United States, however, it received favorable reviews.

Trocchi was then deep in the throes of heroin addiction; he even failed to attend his own launch party for &quot;Cain&#x27;s Book&quot;. His wife Lyn prostituted herself on the streets of the Lower East Side. He injected himself on camera during a live television debate on drug abuse, despite being on bail at the time. He had been charged with supplying heroin to a minor, an offence then punishable by death. A jail term seemed certain, but with the help of friends (including Norman Mailer), Trocchi was smuggled over the Canada–US border where he was given refuge in Montreal by poet Irving Layton and met up with Leonard Cohen. His wife Lyn was arrested and son Marc detained, but later joined Trocchi in London.

==Later life==
In the late 1950s he lived in Venice, California, then the centre of the Southern California Beat scene. In October 1955, he became involved with the Lettrist International and then the Situationist International. His text &quot;Invisible Insurrection of a Million Minds&quot; was published in the Scottish journal &quot;New Saltire&quot; in 1962 and subsequently as &quot;Technique du Coup du Monde&quot; in &quot;Internationale Situationniste&quot;, number 8. It proposed an international &quot;spontaneous university&quot; as a cultural force and marked the beginning of his movement towards his &quot;sigma&quot; project, which played a formative part in the UK Underground.

Trocchi appeared at the 1962 Edinburgh Writers Festival where he claimed &quot;sodomy&quot; as a basis for his writing. During the festival, Hugh MacDiarmid denounced him as &quot;cosmopolitan scum&quot;. However, while this incident is well known, it is little remarked upon that the two men subsequently engaged in correspondence, and actually became friends. Trocchi then moved to London, where he remained for the rest of his life.

He began a new novel, &quot;The Long Book&quot;, which he did not finish. Much of his sporadic work of the 1960s was collected as &quot;The Sigma Portfolio&quot;. In March 1966 the &quot;Internationale Situationniste,&quot; issue number 10, announced &quot;Upon the appearance in London of the first publications of the &#x27;Project Sigma&#x27; initiated by Alexander Trocchi, it was mutually agreed that the SI could not involve itself in such a loose cultural venture... It is therefore no longer as a member of the SI that our friend Alexander Trocchi has since developed an activity of which we fully approve of several aspects.&quot; He continued writing but published little. He opened a small book store near his Kensington home. He was known in Notting Hill as &quot;Scots Alec&quot;.

In the 1960s and 70s, Trocchi lived at 4 Observatory Gardens, Kensington, London on the two top floors of a 19th-century terrace block comprising six storeys. He had two sons: Marc Alexander and Nicholas. The elder son, Marc died of cancer at age 19 in 1976, shortly after Alexander&#x27;s American wife Lyn died of complications from hepatitis.

After undergoing surgery for lung cancer, he died of pneumonia in London on 15 April 1984.

The younger son, Nicholas, returned to the family&#x27;s home in London less than a year after his father&#x27;s death and leapt to his death from the top floor of the five-storey building. When the terrace block was extensively refurbished into luxury apartments in the 1980s, the number on Alexander Trocchi&#x27;s house was removed.

==Resurgence==
Interest in Trocchi and his role in the avant-garde movements of the mid-20th century began to rise soon after his death. &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot; published a &quot;Trocchi Number&quot; in 1985 and their parent house published the biography, &quot;The Making of the Monster&quot; by Andrew Murray Scott, who had known Trocchi for four years in London and who went on to compile the anthology, &quot;Invisible Insurrection&quot;, in 1991, also for Polygon. These works were influential in bringing Trocchi back to public attention. Scott assisted the Estate in attempting to regain control of Trocchi&#x27;s material and to license new editions in the UK and US and Far East, also collating and annotating all remaining manuscripts and documents in the Estate&#x27;s possession.

During the 1990s, various American and Scottish publishers (most notably Rebel Inc.) reissued his originally pseudonymous Olympia Press novels and a retrospective of his articles for &quot;Merlin&quot; and others, &quot;A Life in Pieces&quot; (1997), was issued in response to revived interest in his life and work by a younger generation. His early novel &quot;Young Adam&quot; was adapted into a film starring Ewan McGregor and Tilda Swinton in 2003 after several years of wrangling over finance.

&quot;Tainted Love&quot; (2005) by Stewart Home contains a lengthy &#x27;factional&#x27; meditation on Trocchi&#x27;s post-literary career period in Notting Hill. In 2009 Oneworld Publications reissued &quot;Man at Leisure&quot; (1972), complete with the original introduction by William Burroughs, and in 2011 Oneworld Publications also re-released &quot;Cain&#x27;s Book&quot;, with a foreword by Tom McCarthy.

<doc id="51946" wikidata="Q909777" url="?curid=51946" title="Roosevelt Island">
<text>Roosevelt Island is an island in New York City&#x27;s East River, within the borough of Manhattan. It lies between Manhattan Island to the west, and the borough of Queens, on Long Island, to the east. It is about long, with an area of , and had a population of 11,722 as of the 2020 United States census. It consists of two largely residential communities: Northtown and Southtown. Roosevelt Island is owned by the city but was leased to the New York State Urban Development Corporation (UDC) for 99 years in 1969.

The island was called &#x27; by the Lenape and &#x27; (Hog Island) by the Dutch during the colonial era and later Blackwell″s Island. During much of the 19th and 20th centuries, the island was used by hospitals and prisons, with very limited access. It was renamed Welfare Island in 1921. Following several proposals to redevelop Welfare Island in the 1960s, the UDC leased the island, renamed it after former U.S. president Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1973, and redeveloped it as a series of residential neighborhoods. The first phase of Northtown, the island&#x27;s first community, was completed in 1974, followed by the second phase (Northtown II) in 1989. Southtown was developed in the early 21st century, along with the Cornell Tech higher-education campus.

In addition to residential towers, the island has several buildings that predate the residential development, including six that are New York City designated landmarks. The island is accessible by numerous modes of transport, including a bridge, an aerial tram, and the city&#x27;s subway and ferry systems. Many government services, such as emergency services, are provided from Queens, but the island also has a post office and a pneumatic garbage-disposal system. There are several parks on Roosevelt Island as well, including a promenade around the island&#x27;s perimeter and Four Freedoms Park at its southern end. In addition to Cornell Tech, the island contains an elementary school. Several houses of worship are located on Roosevelt Island, and numerous community organizations have been founded there.

== Geography ==
Roosevelt Island is located in the middle of the East River, between Manhattan Island to the west and Queens to the east. The island&#x27;s southern tip faces 47th Street on Manhattan Island, while its northern tip faces 86th Street on Manhattan Island. It is about long, with a maximum width of . The island was prior to the 18th century but has been expanded to . Administratively, it is part of the New York City borough of Manhattan. Together with Mill Rock, Roosevelt Island constitutes Manhattan&#x27;s Census Tract 238, which has a land area of .

The island is one of the southernmost locations in New York City where Fordham gneiss, a type of bedrock commonly found beneath the South Bronx, can be seen above ground. The gneiss outcropping was surrounded by dolomite, which was worn down by East River currents, creating the current island. The layer of bedrock is shallow and is covered by glacial till, and a 2012 study found no evidence of ponds or streams on the island. Since the 19th century, the island&#x27;s natural topography has been modified drastically, and fill has been added to Roosevelt Island to increase its area. An ancient fault line, known as Cameron&#x27;s Line, runs within the East River between Roosevelt Island and Queens.

Roosevelt Island&#x27;s street layout is based on a master plan designed in 1969 by the architects Philip Johnson and John Burgee. Main Street runs the length of the island, splitting into a loop around Southtown; it was the island&#x27;s only road until 1989. The street is paved in red brick. Main Street, along with the island&#x27;s parks, was intended to be a communal area for the island&#x27;s various ethnic groups and socioeconomic classes. The island&#x27;s residences and businesses are largely clustered around Main Street. Roosevelt Island is surrounded by a seawall of Fordham gneiss, quarried from the island itself.

==History==
=== Early history ===
==== Lenape use ====
According to archaeological digs, the area around Roosevelt Island was settled by Paleo-Indians up to 12,000 years ago. In particular, the area was the homeland of the Mareckawick, a group of Lenape Native Americans, who called it . The name is variously translated as &quot;long island&quot; or &quot;It&#x27;s nice to be on the island&quot;. The historian Isaac Newton Phelps Stokes claimed that the name referred to Randalls Island, but this claim has not been corroborated.

The Lenape may have visited the island. Archeological studies have found shell middens just opposite the island, along both the Queens and Manhattan shores, and the Lenape are known to have had settlements around waterways. However, the island likely did not have any Lenape settlements because of the lack of freshwater. There is little evidence of Native American activities on the island from before the Archaic period (which ended around 1000 BCE).

==== Dutch colonization ====
There are disputes over who owned the island after the European colonization of New Netherland in the 17th century. According to several sources, Dutch Governor Wouter van Twiller was said to have purchased the island from the Lenape in 1637. A study from 1988 found that Van Twiller&#x27;s deed referred to what is now Randalls and Wards Islands further north, but a subsequent study said that Van Twiller acquired Randalls, Wards, Roosevelt, and Governors islands simultaneously. In any case, Roosevelt Island was known in early modern Dutch as &quot;Varcken[s]&quot;, &quot;Varken&quot;, or &quot;Verckens Eylandt&quot;, all of which are translated in modern English as Hog Island ().

By 1639, Jan Claessen Alteras was known to have farmed Hog Island. Reports indicate that Alteras had made improvements to the island by 1642, though the nature of the work is not known. New Netherland director-general Peter Stuyvesant took over the island in 1642. The following year, it was leased to Francois Fyn. Fyn, in turn, leased the island to Laurens Duyts, who developed further structures on the island. Duyts defaulted on his lease in 1658 and was deported for &quot;gross immoralities&quot;, and Fyn&#x27;s lawyer took back the island.

==== Manning and Blackwell ownership ====
After the Dutch surrendered to the British in 1664, a British military captain named John Manning acquired the island in 1668. In 1673, Manning surrendered to Dutch forces who had wanted to retake New Netherland; as punishment, he had to live on the island in exile. After Manning&#x27;s banishment, the isle became known as Manning&#x27;s Island. Manning had a mansion near the island&#x27;s southern tip, where he served rum punch to visitors. The island was then conveyed to Manning&#x27;s stepdaughter Mary in 1676 or 1685. Mary was married to Robert Blackwell, who became the island&#x27;s new owner and namesake. The &quot;Brooklyn Times-Union&quot; wrote that the island had gained the Blackwell name &quot;by a mere chance, or the result of a marriage&quot;.

The Blackwell family settled the island over four generations. At the beginning of the 18th century, Blackwell built his farmhouse, the Blackwell House, on the island. Blackwell&#x27;s Island was not a major battleground in the American Revolutionary War, though British troops tried to take the island after the 1776 Battle of Long Island. The British briefly seized control on September 2–4, 1776, after which the American troops took over. A British prison inspector proposed using the island as a prison in the early 1780s, but it is not known whether this happened. Blackwell&#x27;s sons took over the island in 1780 and tried to sell it, at which point Blackwell&#x27;s Island had several buildings and was several miles removed from New York City. By the mid-1780s, the island included two houses, orchards, a cider mill, and other farm structures. Contemporary sources do not mention any structures on the northern half of the island. A public auction was held in 1785, but no one bought the island. In 1796, Blackwell&#x27;s great-grandson Jacob Blackwell constructed the Blackwell House, one of Manhattan&#x27;s oldest houses. James L. Bell paid the Blackwells $30,000 for the island in 1823, but Blackwell took back control two years later, upon Bell&#x27;s death. One source indicated that Bell never fulfilled the terms of the sale.

=== Hospital and prison island ===
By 1826, the city almshouse at Bellevue Hospital was overcrowded, prompting city officials to consider moving that facility to Blackwell&#x27;s Island. The city government purchased the island for $32,000 () on July 19, 1828. Ownership of the island remained unresolved for another 16 years while Bell&#x27;s widow sued the city. Through the 19th century, the island housed several hospitals and a prison. At one point there were 26 institutions on the island.

==== 1830s to 1860s ====
The city government erected a penitentiary on the island, which opened August 3, 1830. There were proposals to construct a canal to split male and female prisoners; though the canal was not built, an unknown architect did build a separate building for female prisoners. The island&#x27;s prison population already numbered in the hundreds by 1838, whereas there were only 24 staff members (including those not assigned to guard duties). By 1839, the New York City Lunatic Asylum opened, including the Octagon Tower. The asylum, with two wings made of locally quarried Fordham gneiss, at one point held 1,700 inmates, twice its designed capacity. Prisoners frequently tried to swim away from the island. Almshouses, or housing for the poor, were constructed in 1847. Other hospitals were soon developed on the island, including a 600-bed prison hospital that was finished in 1849. Thomas Story Kirkbride, who oversaw some of the island&#x27;s hospitals, described the island as having fallen into &quot;degradation and neglect&quot; by 1848.

A workhouse was built on the island in 1852, followed by the Smallpox Hospital in 1856. The Asylum burned down in 1858 and was rebuilt on the same site, and the prison hospital was destroyed in the same fire. Two pipes provided fresh water from the Croton Aqueduct to the island by 1860, and maps indicate that Blackwell&#x27;s Island had two reservoirs as well. The prison hospital was replaced with City Hospital (later known as Charity Hospital), which was completed in 1861 and served both prisoners and New York City&#x27;s poorer population. A &quot;hospital for incurables&quot; followed in 1866.

==== 1870s to 1890s ====
Prisoners built the Blackwell Island Light on the island&#x27;s northern tip in 1872. In 1877, the hospital opened a School of Nursing, the fourth such training institution in the nation.

Late-19th-century editions of the &quot;Appleton&#x27;s Dictionary of New York&quot; described Blackwell&#x27;s Island&#x27;s penitentiary as having a &quot;feudal character&quot;. Conditions in some of the hospitals declined significantly enough that the island as a whole gained a poor reputation. The women&#x27;s hospital on the island was completed in 1881. Inmates from the Smallpox Hospital were moved to North Brother Island in 1885, and the Smallpox Hospital building became a nurses&#x27; training school and dormitory. In addition, a male nurse&#x27;s training school opened in 1887 and operated for 16 years. The Chapel of the Good Shepherd opened on the island in 1889.

The Strecker Memorial Laboratory was constructed in 1892 for the City Hospital. The next year, the city began sending typhus patients to the island. During the decade, city officials found the almshouse and City Hospital dilapidated and overcrowded, and a grand jury declared the women&#x27;s asylum a &quot;disgrace&quot; to New York City. The asylum&#x27;s inmates were transferred to Wards Island in the mid-1890s, and Wards Island&#x27;s Homeopathic Hospital relocated to Blackwell&#x27;s Island, becoming the Metropolitan Hospital. A proposal to build a power plant on the island in 1895 was unsuccessful, and the city began planning to expand the island&#x27;s prisons the next year. Work began on new structures for the City Hospital and the almshouse in early 1897, and eleven new almshouse buildings opened that October. There were also plans to add eight pavilions to the island&#x27;s infants&#x27; hospital. The prison&#x27;s hospital burned down in 1899. At the end of the century, the island housed 7,000 people across seven institutions.

==== 1900s and 1910s ====

By the 20th century, Blackwell&#x27;s Island had received the nickname of &quot;Farewell Island&quot; because of its connotations with fear and despair, and it was also known as simply &quot;The Island&quot;. At the time, the island contained a poorhouse, the city jail, and several hospitals. The United States Department of the Navy proposed a drill ground and training facility at Blackwell&#x27;s Island&#x27;s northern end in 1901, although city officials opposed it. The following year, there was a proposal to turn the island over to the federal government and raze many of the existing structures; the city&#x27;s controller was also against this plan. Other proposals for the island in the first decade of the 20th century included new tuberculosis (consumptive) hospitals, additional almshouses, an electric power plant, and general hospitals. A tuberculosis ward at Metropolitan Hospital opened on the island in 1902, followed by an expanded nurses&#x27; school the next year. By the mid-1900s, the &quot;Louisville Courier-Journal&quot; called the island &quot;the world&#x27;s best guarded prison&quot;, and the &quot;New-York Tribune&quot; described the island as unsanitary. The city&#x27;s controller recommended the construction of a new hospital to alleviate the poor conditions.

A proposal to convert the island into a park resurfaced in 1907. By the end of the decade, thousands of elderly residents voluntarily traveled to the island for &quot;vacations&quot; every year. The island&#x27;s prisoners manufactured goods for the city, such as beds, brushes, and clothes, and the Russell Sage Foundation set up a short-lived pathology institute on the island in 1907. The Queensboro Bridge, crossing Blackwell&#x27;s Island, opened in 1909, but it did not provide direct access to the island until the late 1910s. In addition, in the early 1910s, several buildings were added at the island&#x27;s City and Metropolitan hospitals, and a Catholic chapel was developed on the island. City corrections commissioner Katharine Davis announced plans to construct a prison hospital on the island in 1915; there was very little vacant land on the island by then.

By the 1910s, twenty-five thousand prisoners passed through the island&#x27;s jail annually, and Mayor William Jay Gaynor proposed shutting the jail. There were also proposals to move the penitentiary to Hart Island, freeing up Blackwell&#x27;s Island for hospitals and charitable institutions. The city&#x27;s deputy correction correctioner called the island&#x27;s penitentiary &quot;unfit for pigs&quot; in a 1914 report criticizing the unsanitary and overcrowded conditions, and a grand jury investigation the same year found that the jail was severely mismanaged. Blackwell&#x27;s Island Penitentiary was negatively affecting the reputation of the island&#x27;s other facilities, to the point where a renaming of the island was under discussion. The women&#x27;s penitentiary underwent reforms during the mid-1910s, and some prisoners were sent off the island to other jails. Bird S. Coler ordered that the island&#x27;s buildings be refurbished after he became the city&#x27;s public welfare commissioner in 1918.

==== 1920s and 1930s ====
In 1921, the city began using Blackwell&#x27;s Penitentiary to detain women who were awaiting trial. The island&#x27;s prison hospital was severely understaffed, and the prison was described as &quot;a disgrace to the City of New York&quot;. That April, the New York City Board of Aldermen renamed Blackwell&#x27;s Island to Welfare Island. The aldermen hoped the new name would improve the island&#x27;s reputation, though the United States Board on Geographic Names did not recognize the name change for four decades. The state&#x27;s prison commission recommended converting the island to a park in 1924, and the city began planning to move Welfare Island&#x27;s inmates to a new jail complex on Rikers Island further north. By then, the Welfare Island penitentiary lacked plumbing, had rat infestations, and was susceptible to fire. The prison&#x27;s hospital was so overcrowded that ill inmates had to be treated in their cells. Prison staff were poorly compensated, and the prison received little to no maintenance.

A chapel was dedicated on the island in 1925, followed by a synagogue in 1926. The city government also expanded the island&#x27;s Cancer Institute in the 1920s. The State Department of Correction described the island in the early 1930s as &quot;absolutely unsuitable for the purpose for which it is now used&quot;. The Board of Estimate rezoned the island in 1933 to allow redevelopment. At the time, officials were planning a children&#x27;s hospital and nurses&#x27; dormitory on the island. Municipal prison commissioner Austin MacCormick reformed the island&#x27;s prison in 1934 following a series of uprisings. By then, the old almshouse (the City Home) was so overcrowded that patients were being housed in abandoned portions of the Lunatic Asylum. Welfare Island&#x27;s jail was scheduled to be relocated, and city parks commissioner Robert Moses proposed converting the jail site to a public park. A city committee instead recommended a plan by city hospital commissioner S. S. Goldwater, who proposed expanding the island&#x27;s hospital facilities.

After the Rikers Island jail complex opened, workers demolished the Welfare Island jail, and all inmates had been relocated by February 1936. The city announced plans for a chronic care hospital complex in 1936. When the Welfare Island Hospital for Chronic Diseases, later Goldwater Memorial Hospital, opened in July 1939, the Central and Neurological Hospital closed. An eight-building camp also opened in 1939.

==== 1940s to 1960s ====
During the mid-1940s, plans were filed for a combined laundry, garage, and firehouse building; a hospital at Welfare Island&#x27;s northern tip; a nurses&#x27; training school; and a chronic-disease ward at the Metropolitan Hospital. A girls&#x27; shelter on the island opened in late 1945. By the late 1940s, mayor William O&#x27;Dwyer described conditions at some of the island&#x27;s hospitals as &quot;frightful&quot;, mainly because of their age. A chronic-care hospital and a laundry building were developed on Welfare Island during that era. The laundry building began construction in 1948 and was completed the next year. Work on a 2,000-bed facility, later known as the Bird S. Coler Hospital, also began in 1948. Further projects were proposed in the late 1940s, including the Welfare Island Bridge to Queens, a laboratory for Goldwater Hospital, and two hospitals with a combined 1,500 beds. The bridge was intended to relieve traffic caused by the island&#x27;s new hospitals, while the additional hospitals would serve the city&#x27;s growing elderly population.

During the early 1950s, the city planned a 1,500-bed hospital on the island and wished to convert the island&#x27;s Cancer Institute into a tuberculosis hospital. After Coler Hospital opened in 1952, patients were relocated there from the City Home for Dependents. City Home was emptied out by 1953. The Welfare Island Bridge opened in May 1955, and a bus began serving the island. The Metropolitan Hospital moved to mainland Manhattan later that year, while the City Hospital was replaced in 1957 by Elmhurst Hospital Center in Queens. Several medical facilities on the island opened during the mid-1950s, including an elderly rehabilitation center at Goldwater Hospital, a polio treatment center at Goldwater, and a children&#x27;s rehabilitation center at Coler Hospital. There were also proposals to establish a &quot;fire college&quot; and a women&#x27;s jail on the island. Another medical facility for chronically ill and elderly patients opened on Welfare Island in 1958.

By 1960, half of Welfare Island was abandoned, and the Goldwater and Bird S. Coler hospitals were the only remaining institutions there. The city government had been trying since 1957, without success, to obtain $1 million to demolish the abandoned buildings. The New York City Fire Department (FDNY) opened a training school in 1962, using 90 abandoned buildings for training purposes. One reporter in 1967 called Welfare Island a &quot;ghost town, vacant lot, woodland and mausoleum for unhappy memories&quot;.

=== Redevelopment plans ===

==== Early- and mid-1960s proposals ====
The businessman and politician Frederick W. Richmond announced a proposal in 1961 to redevelop the island with residences for 70,000 people. The plan would have cost $450 million and would have included a two-level platform supporting buildings as tall as 50 stories. The American Institute of Architects&#x27; New York chapter proposed that the island instead become a park, while yet another plan called for the island to become housing for United Nations staff. Other plans included those for a college campus or a smaller-scale residential area. A New York City Subway station on Welfare Island was announced in February 1965 as part of the new 63rd Street lines under the East River; the subway announcement spurred additional plans for the island&#x27;s redevelopment. There were plans to rename Welfare Island because the public generally associated the name negatively with the island&#x27;s hospitals, and even the hospital&#x27;s patients wanted the island to be renamed.

The city government ordered the demolition of six dilapidated buildings on the island in 1965. The city took over another 45 abandoned hospital buildings via condemnation in June 1966, and the New York City Board of Estimate applied for $250,000 in federal funds for a feasibility study on the island&#x27;s redevelopment later that year. The New York state government proposed in December 1967 to convert most of the island into a public park, except for senior citizens&#x27; housing at the north end. The United Nations International School considered developing a campus at the island&#x27;s southern end, and the New York Board of Trade pushed to redevelop the island as a city park. Other plans included a mix of recreational facilities and low-density housing; an amusement park similar to Tivoli Gardens in Copenhagen; an underground nuclear power plant; a cemetery; and a &quot;city of the future&quot;.

==== Johnson and Burgee plan ====
In February 1968, mayor John V. Lindsay named a committee to make recommendations for the island&#x27;s development, at which point one newspaper called it &quot;the most expensive wasteland in the world&quot;. The state government established the Welfare Island Development Corporation (WIDC; later the Roosevelt Island Development Corporation or RIDC) that April. Early the next year, the state government canceled plans for a state park encompassing Welfare Island, and Lindsay&#x27;s committee recommended renaming the island and developing housing units and recreational facilities there. Land clearing began that April, and Lindsay asked the New York State Urban Development Corporation (UDC) to help redevelop the island in May. The city and state governments formally presented their proposal for Welfare Island in October 1969. After the Board of Estimate approved the plan later that month, the UDC signed a 99-year lease with the city that December. The city could pay either two percent of the development cost or 40 percent of any profits. The UDC issued $250 million in bonds to help finance the project. The state hoped to finish the project within eight years.

The architects Philip Johnson and John Burgee designed the master plan for Welfare Island, which called for two neighborhoods named Northtown and Southtown, separated by a common area. The island was to become a car-free area with apartments, stores, community centers, and a waterfront promenade. The apartments ranged in size from studios to four-bedroom units and were a mixture of rental and cooperative units. There would be a hotel, public schools, stores, and office space, and several existing buildings would be retained. Services such as parks and schools were near every residence, and there was a pneumatic trash collection system. The first apartment buildings banned dogs, but this prohibition was not applied to buildings developed later. Additionally, the hospitals on the island still needed vehicular access, so the car ban was ultimately repealed.

By the early 1970s, the families of Welfare Island&#x27;s three chaplains were the only people living on the island, excluding hospital patients. Models of Johnson and Burgee&#x27;s proposal were exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in late 1970. The UDC modified some of Johnson and Burgee&#x27;s designs after they were publicized; for example, it added more buildings on the waterfront. The redevelopment attracted residents who wanted a better quality of life. Critics expressed concerns about the fact that lower- and upper-income residents were placed on opposite sides of Main Street, and they also questioned whether the project&#x27;s $400 million construction budget could have been spent on other projects.

=== Redevelopment ===

==== Renaming and development of Northtown ====

The first phase of the development, Northtown, was to accommodate about 2,100 families. The law professor Adam Yarmolinsky was hired to lead the WIDC in late 1970, but he resigned after just over a year. Work formally began in mid-1971, and the state approved the construction of the first buildings the same year. The UDC hired at least 17 architectural and engineering companies to design the structures, though many of the architects resigned during construction. The WIDC approved a proposal for 1,100 middle-income and luxury apartments in April 1972; the UDC decided to build the residences as housing cooperatives after unsuccessfully looking for a private developer. The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development formally designated Welfare Island as a &quot;new town&quot; in December 1972, making it eligible for additional funds.

UDC considered renaming the island to attract new residents; the Four Freedoms Foundation proposed renaming it for U.S. president Franklin D. Roosevelt. The City Council approved the name change in July 1973, and Welfare Island was renamed Roosevelt Island on August 20, 1973. Officials began planning the Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedoms Park as well; although the island had been renamed in anticipation of the park&#x27;s construction, the project was delayed for the next several decades. By the middle of 1973, one building had topped out, and the island had been expanded by using dirt from the 63rd Street Tunnel&#x27;s construction. UDC head Edward J. Logue and project manager Robert Litke convinced multiple developers to sign 40-year leases for buildings on the island. Parts of the project were delayed by disputes over the relocation of a laundry building. By the end of the year, an advisory group recommended that the state legislature halt all UDC financing for the unbuilt phases of the Roosevelt Island development, citing the state&#x27;s financial shortfalls. At least one of the residential structures&#x27; builders had also gone bankrupt. Construction proceeded steadily through 1974, and renting began that October. In addition, the existing Blackwell House and Chapel of the Good Shepherd were renovated.

After Logue was fired in early 1975, there was uncertainty over whether additional buildings would ever be built, especially given the UDC&#x27;s financial troubles. The UDC decided to complete the first phase of the island&#x27;s development, on which it had already spent $180 million, and the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal took over the UDC&#x27;s residential developments, including Roosevelt Island. Following an architectural design competition, the UDC hired four architecture firms to design the second phase of Northtown that year. Residents began moving into Roosevelt Island&#x27;s first building in April 1975. Initially, there were no stores on the island, and residents had to pass through Queens to go anywhere else. Although people were not incentivized to move to Roosevelt Island because of the lack of public transportation, the island was home to 170 families by the end of 1975. The first four buildings in Northtown were all completed by mid-1976, while the storefronts were slowly being rented.

==== Development of Northtown II ====
No new buildings were completed between 1976 and 1989, due to delays in the subway line&#x27;s opening and the city&#x27;s financial troubles. The Roosevelt Island Tramway to Manhattan opened in May 1976, and the U.S. government provided a grant the same year to fund the construction of parks on the island. Rivercross, the only cooperative apartment building in Northtown, generally attracted upper-class families because of its high monthly fees, while the other buildings attracted middle-class residents. The FDNY training school moved to Randalls Island in 1977, and the old Roosevelt Island campus was razed. There were over 3,000 residents by early 1977 and 5,500 residents by 1978. Two-thirds of the island&#x27;s storefronts were still empty by the end of 1977, even as almost all of the rental apartments and most of the cooperative apartments were occupied. The UDC leased some land in late 1977 to the Starrett Corporation, which planned to erect three additional buildings with a combined 1,000 apartments. Starrett and the UDC signed an agreement in June 1979, in which Starrett agreed to build the three buildings, collectively known as Northtown II, for $82 million.

New York state comptroller Edward V. Regan published a report in 1980, saying that the Roosevelt Island redevelopment suffered from severe cost overruns and was losing money. Starrett continued to modify its plans for Northtown II, and, by 1982, the New York state government planned to begin developing Northtown II. The opening of the subway, which would support the island&#x27;s increasing population, had been repeatedly delayed, even as residents expressed concerns that the subway would cause the island&#x27;s low crime rate to increase. By then, the island had 5,000 residents and 1,800 hospital patients, but relatively few businesses. The state legislature created the Roosevelt Island Operating Corporation (RIOC) to operate the island in 1984.

The UDC re-approved the Northtown II plan in July 1984, and RIOC approved it in 1986. The revised plans called for five buildings, containing a total of 1,100 apartments. Opponents of the Northtown II project wanted to maintain the island&#x27;s character and expressed concerns about the lack of mass transit options; following a lawsuit to block Northtown II, a judge approved it in late 1986. Work on Northtown II commenced at the end of 1987, financed by a $176 million mortgage loan from the city. The Northtown II towers, known as Manhattan Park, opened in 1989. While the new apartments initially sold at a slower-than-expected pace, Northtown II was 70 percent occupied by early 1990.

==== 1990s developments ====
The opening of the Roosevelt Island subway station, in late 1989, allowed further development to proceed. Officials announced the Southtown development in October 1989. Designed by Raquel Ramati Associates, it was to consist of 1,956 apartments, split evenly between market-rate and affordable apartments. The development would span and house up to 5,000 people. The New York City Board of Estimate approved plans for Southtown in August 1990, but the project had been placed on hold by 1991 because RIOC had not been able to secure a developer. For much of the 1990s, no large buildings were completed on Roosevelt Island.

In part because of the lack of development, the island&#x27;s population remained lower than expected, requiring it to be subsidized. By the mid-1990s, the island had 8,200 residents, less than half the 20,000 that the state government had originally envisioned, and there were around 20 small stores. To attract visitors, RIOC developed several recreational facilities and parks and sought to restore the island&#x27;s oldest buildings. RIOC also planned to remove about of land to make way for a seawall. The architect Santiago Calatrava was hired to design a visitor center in the 1990s, but this was never built.

RIOC proposed selling off the Southtown site in 1997, and the Related Companies and Hudson Companies signed an agreement to develop Southtown. The plans for Southtown were subsequently redrawn; the revised plan called for three buildings to the east of Main Street, six buildings to the west, and new recreational fields. Southtown&#x27;s development also entailed reducing the size of the existing Blackwell Park, which prompted opposition from Northtown residents who used the park. A 26-story hotel with a convention center was proposed on the island in 1998, though this plan was controversial. There was also growing discontent with RIOC. As a result, mayor Rudy Giuliani proposed having the city take over the island in 1999, and state legislator Pete Grannis also proposed legislation to allow the island to govern itself. A contractor was hired to build the first section of Southtown in May 1999, and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center indicated that it would build a tower in Southtown to house its staff.

==== 2000s to present ====
By the 2000 United States census, Roosevelt Island had a population of 9,520. Some of the island&#x27;s original buildings, which were part of the Mitchell–Lama affordable housing program, were planned to be converted to market-rate housing during the time. Southtown&#x27;s first buildings, including two structures for medical workers were announced in early 2001. The first two Southtown buildings were completed in 2002, and a proposal to redevelop the Octagon tower as an apartment building was announced that year. The largely inaccessible Southpoint Park was opened year-round in 2003, a year after Governor George Pataki signed legislation designating several parks on the island. The island&#x27;s first two condominium buildings, both in Southtown, and the Octagon were developed next. All three structures had been completed by 2007, increasing the island&#x27;s population to around 12,000. Southtown&#x27;s fifth and sixth buildings were completed by 2008. By the late 2000s, there were long waiting lists for residences on the island, and people quickly moved into the new residential buildings. Although the Roosevelt Island Residents Association expressed concerns that the new developments would cause gentrification, the island largely retained its middle-class housing stock.

Work commenced on Four Freedoms Park in 2009, along with a redesign of Southpoint Park. Southpoint Park reopened in 2011, and Four Freedoms Park was finished the next year. A RIOC survey from 2010 found that only 12 percent of residents shopped on the island, and RIOC leased the island&#x27;s largely vacant retail space to the Related Companies and Hudson Companies the next year. Related and Hudson renovated 33 storefronts, while RIOC waived food-truck permit fees to entice food vendors. The city government selected Technion – Israel Institute of Technology and Cornell University in late 2011 to develop the Cornell Tech research center on the island; the proposal included three towers, a hotel, and a conference center. The campus replaced the outmoded Goldwater Memorial Hospital, which closed in 2013. Work on Cornell Tech itself began in 2015, and the campus opened two years later. Graduate students moved to the island after Cornell Tech opened.

Meanwhile, the island&#x27;s population had grown to 11,661 by the 2010 United States census. Some of the Mitchell–Lama apartments were converted to market-rate housing in the 2010s, while development of additional residential structures continued. The seventh Riverwalk building was finished in 2015, followed by the eighth in 2019. Firefighters Field was renovated with the development of the eighth Riverwalk building. To attract visitors, RIOC announced in 2018 that it would create an &quot;art trail&quot; around the island. RIOC began soliciting plans for a memorial to the journalist Nellie Bly in 2019; it ultimately commissioned &quot;The Girl Puzzle&quot; monument by Amanda Matthews, which was dedicated in December 2021. There was an additional influx of residents during the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City, particularly among those looking for open space. The final building in Southtown, Riverwalk 9, began construction in November 2022 and topped out the next year. In March 2024, plans were announced for a &quot;healing forest&quot; at the southern end of the island.

== Demographics ==
When the first residential buildings opened, Roosevelt Island&#x27;s amenities and wheelchair accessibility made it attractive to disabled residents and families with children. Many of the first residents were white, middle-income families, and disabled patients from the island&#x27;s hospitals moved into the apartments as well. The island also attracted residents who wanted to live in a racially integrated neighborhood, as well as those who wanted to avoid housing discrimination in other areas.

Due to its proximity to the headquarters of the United Nations, Roosevelt Island attracted UN employees almost as soon as the first building opened. A &quot;New York Times&quot; article from 1999 described Roosevelt Island&#x27;s diverse demographics as being another factor in its popularity among diplomatic staff. The island has been home to many diplomatic staff over the years, including Kofi Annan when he was United Nations Secretary General. One of every three Roosevelt Island residents was foreign-born by 2000.

The 2020 United States census showed that Roosevelt Island had a population of 11,722, across three census tracts. The racial makeup of Roosevelt Island&#x27;s three census tracts was 36.3% (4,251) White, 10.6% (1,237) African American, 33.2% (3,897) Asian, 2.8% (333) from other races, and 4.8% (564) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino residents of any race were 12.3% (1,440) of the population. In the 2020 census data from the New York City Department of City Planning, Roosevelt Island is grouped as part of the Upper East Side-Lenox Hill-Roosevelt Island neighborhood tabulation area. The neighborhood tabulation area had 59,200 residents.

== Community ==
Roosevelt Island&#x27;s redevelopment in the 1970s spurred the creation of a community distinct from the rest of Manhattan. Following Northtown&#x27;s completion, an architectural critic wrote for &quot;Architectural Design&quot; that Roosevelt Island &quot;seems to be more of a hermetically sealed suburb than an integral part of New York City&quot;. One newspaper from 1989 described the island as a &quot;small, self-contained, family-oriented community&quot;, with its own Little League Baseball team, newspaper, and library. A &quot;Washington Post&quot; article from the same year described the island as having the feel of a small town but with a closer connection to Manhattan. A &quot;New York Times&quot; article from 1999 said the island had the feel of &quot;a postwar suburb of some European city&quot;, distinct from the rest of New York City. In 2008, the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; described the island as a &quot;fantastic and peaceful place to live&quot;, albeit with many disputes among residents.

Over the years, several dozen volunteer groups have been developed on the island. These include the Roosevelt Island Garden Club, which consists of 120 plots tended by members. There is also a farmer&#x27;s market. in addition to organizations such as the Roosevelt Island Visual Art Association and the Main Street Theatre &amp; Dance Alliance. A historical society, the Roosevelt Island Historical Society, has archival material about the island&#x27;s history. The island has a biweekly newspaper, &quot;The Main Street Wire&quot;, which was founded in 1981; it originally had a column with pieces about the history of Roosevelt Island.

There have been community traditions on Roosevelt Island, such as Halloween parades, Black History Month events, and Lunar New Year celebrations. Various activities take place on the island throughout the year, such as picnics and concerts, in addition to annual Roosevelt Island Day celebrations since 1995. The island has also hosted events like the Roosevelt Island Table Tennis Tournament and the Figment NYC festival. Every summer since 2015, the Manhattan Park Pool Club has commissioned a mural for the Manhattan Park development&#x27;s pool deck. Roosevelt Island has sometimes been used as a filming location, such as for the films &quot;Spider-Man&quot; (2002) and &quot;Dark Water&quot; (2005).

== Buildings ==
The 1969 master plan divided the island into two residential communities: Northtown and Southtown. The plan received mixed reviews. A writer for &quot;New York&quot; magazine wrote that the Johnson–Burgee design was &quot;a nice plan for a very nice community&quot;, while an &quot;Architectural Forum&quot; reviewer called it &quot;purposefully schematic and architecturally nonspecific&quot;. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; wrote of the buildings on the island: &quot;Their physical surfaces are harsh but the streetscapes aren&#x27;t.&quot; In 1977, the City Club of New York gave Roosevelt Island&#x27;s buildings a special honor award for the quality of their designs. Although most of the residential structures contain rental apartments, there are also condominiums and cooperative housing. Roosevelt Island generally has more wheelchair-accessible housing than other neighborhoods, in part because of its past use as a hospital island.

=== Northtown ===
The first phase of Roosevelt Island&#x27;s development was called Northtown, with about 2,140 apartments. Northtown consists of four housing complexes: Westview, Island House, Rivercross, and Eastwood. The architectural firm of Sert, Jackson &amp; Associates designed the Island House and Rivercross buildings east of Main Street, while John Johansen and Ashok Bhavnani designed the Eastwood and Westfield buildings on the west side. All four structures are U-shaped buildings, which measure up to 20 stories high and are faced in concrete or corrugated brick. Three of the buildings were rental apartment complexes: Island House, Westview, and Eastwood (the latter of which had affordable housing). Rivercross was structured as a housing cooperative. All of these buildings, except Rivercross, were originally subsidized under the state&#x27;s Mitchell–Lama Housing Program. The first apartments included built-in heating and air-conditioning units, while the buildings themselves included health clubs. Westview and Eastwood also had skip-stop elevators that stopped at three-floor intervals; this allowed for more flexible apartment layouts on floors that were not served by elevators.

Northtown II (also known as Manhattan Park), located north of Northtown and on the west side of Main Street, was developed by the Starrett Corporation and designed by the firm Gruzen Samton. Completed in 1989, it occupies and consists of five buildings. The complex comprises around 1,100 rental apartments, split into about 220 affordable apartments and about 880 market-rate apartments. The affordable apartments are clustered within one building. In all five structures, the apartments range from one to three bedrooms. There are also a garden, picnic space, community center, playgrounds, and daycare center. Near the north end of the island is a 500-unit apartment building known as the Octagon, which is centered around a remaining portion of the Lunatic Asylum.

In addition to the apartment buildings, the northern part of Roosevelt Island contains the Metropolitan Hospital&#x27;s former church, which was built in the 1920s and became a wedding venue in 2021. A stone structure, Chapel of St. Dennis, was built near the Octagon around 1935–1940; little else is known about this chapel.

=== Southtown and southern end ===
Southtown (also referred to as Riverwalk) was developed starting in 2001. When complete, Southtown will have 2,000 units in nine buildings. , eight of Southtown&#x27;s nine planned buildings had been completed, while the last structure was under construction. Some of the buildings house medical staff who work in Manhattan. The structures contain a total of over 2,000 apartments, of which 40 percent are affordable housing. Some of the buildings in Southtown are condominiums, including Riverwalk Place and Riverwalk Court. In contrast to the older Northtown buildings, which were developed in groups, the Riverwalk structures were constructed as standalone buildings; the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; regarded Southtown as lacking the &quot;coherent streetscapes&quot; of Northtown.

The southern end of the island also contains four buildings, which are part of the Cornell Tech graduate-school campus and research center. The $2 billion facility includes 2 million square feet of space on an site. The first phase of the campus includes a main academic building, a graduate housing tower, and an innovation hub/tech incubator. The 26-story Cornell Tech residential tower has 350 apartments and was intended as the world&#x27;s largest passive house residential tower when it was built. Cornell Tech&#x27;s first phase also includes a conference center and a hotel. The hotel is 18 stories high, with 224 rooms, and is known as the Graduate Roosevelt Island; it opened in 2021 as the island&#x27;s first hotel.

=== Designated landmarks ===

Roosevelt Island has six buildings and structures that are New York City designated landmarks, all of which are also on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The Blackwell House at Main Street, one of the city&#x27;s few remaining farmhouses, was built between 1796 and 1804 for James Blackwell. Also along Main Street is the Chapel of the Good Shepherd, an Episcopal church from 1889. Blackwell Island Light, an octagonal Gothic-style lighthouse at the northern end of the island, was built in 1872; it measures tall and was designed by Renwick.

The remaining three official city landmarks are former hospitals. At the island&#x27;s southern tip are the Smallpox Hospital, a Gothic-style ruin built in 1857 as the first smallpox hospital in the U.S., and the Strecker Laboratory, a Romanesque Revival-style electrical substation built in 1892 as a laboratory. At the northern end is the Octagon, the sole remaining structure from the 1839 Lunatic Asylum. The ruins of the City Hospital, a mid-19th-century building on the southern tip of the island, had been listed on the NRHP, but were razed in 1994 due to extreme neglect.

== Governance and infrastructure ==
The neighborhood is part of Manhattan Community District 8. In the 1970s, when the city&#x27;s community districts were being redrawn, there were disputes over whether the island should be served by a district in Manhattan or Queens. While the island was ultimately placed within a Manhattan community district, it received emergency services from Queens. The island&#x27;s other services come from Manhattan; for example, it was still assigned a ZIP Code and an area code from Manhattan. The island has a ZIP Code of 10044, and residents are assigned area codes 212, 332, 646, and 917. The United States Postal Service operates the Roosevelt Island Station at 694 Main Street; the island&#x27;s post office opened in October 1976. The firm of Kallman and McKinnell designed the post office, along with a small fire station and a set of stores.

The Roosevelt Island Operating Corporation, a state public-benefit corporation, operates the island&#x27;s infrastructure and oversees its development. RIOC manages transportation and private security on the island, and it is also responsible for leasing out stores, developing apartments, and preserving the island&#x27;s landmarked buildings. Although RIOC is a state agency, its members are appointed rather than elected, though straw polls for positions on RIOC&#x27;s board were hosted starting in 2008. By law, five of RIOC&#x27;s nine members must be island residents, but not RIOC&#x27;s CEO. Much of RIOC&#x27;s income comes from fees collected from private developers.

=== Utilities ===
Parts of New York City Water Tunnel No. 3, which provides fresh water to much of New York City, pass underneath the island; the section under Roosevelt Island opened in 1998 and travels as much as under the island. Roosevelt Island also had its own steam plant behind the Roosevelt Island Tramway&#x27;s terminal until 2013. In addition, Verdant Power installed tidal turbines under the East River&#x27;s eastern channel in the 2000s as part of the Roosevelt Island Tidal Energy project; The turbines powered small parts of the island. Three new turbines were installed in the 2020s.

==== Waste disposal ====
Before the 1970s, raw waste from Roosevelt Island was dumped directly into the East River. Garbage on Roosevelt Island is collected by an automated vacuum collection (AVAC) system, which consists of pneumatic tubes measuring either , , or wide. Manufactured by Swedish firm Envac and installed in 1975, it was the second AVAC system in the U.S. at the time of its installation, after the Disney utilidor system. It is one of the world&#x27;s largest AVAC systems, collecting trash from 16 residential towers. Trash from each tower is transported to the Central Collections and Compaction Plant at up to . The collection facility contains three turbines that spin the garbage; the trash is then compacted and sent to a landfill. The pneumatic tube system collects or of trash each day. On several occasions, tenants have damaged the system by throwing large objects, such as strollers and Christmas trees, into the tubes.

=== Emergency services ===

NYC Health + Hospitals/Coler is located in the northern portion of the island and has been Roosevelt Island&#x27;s only public hospital since 2013, when Goldwater Memorial Hospital closed. Although the 1969 plan for Roosevelt Island called for dedicated fire and police stations, the island receives all of its emergency services from Queens. Roosevelt Island is patrolled by the 114th Precinct of the New York City Police Department, located at 3416 Astoria Boulevard in Astoria, Queens. The Roosevelt Island Public Safety Department also patrols the island; its officers can make arrests but do not carry weapons.

Roosevelt Island has no firehouse. Fire protection services are provided by Engine Company 260 of the New York City Fire Department (FDNY), located at 1115 37th Avenue in Astoria. The FDNY maintains its Special Operations Command facility at 750 Main Street on the island. Engine Company 261, in Long Island City, served the island until it closed in 2003. There was controversy over the firehouse&#x27;s closure, and a New York Supreme Court judge subsequently ruled that the closure was illegal. In 2019, mayor Bill de Blasio&#x27;s office told reporters that the firehouse would not reopen because the island already had additional emergency services.

== Recreation and green spaces ==

=== Parks ===

When Roosevelt Island was redeveloped in the 1970s, about a quarter of the land area was set aside for parks. The island has four primary parks: Lighthouse, Octagon, Southpoint, and Four Freedoms parks. At the northern tip of Roosevelt Island is Lighthouse Park, named after the Blackwell Island Light. Octagon Park, a green space, contains a prow-shaped performance stage facing the East River&#x27;s west channel; it was originally planned as an ecological park with bedrock outcrops. Near the south end of the island is Southpoint Park, a green space containing the Strecker Lab and Smallpox Hospital buildings. The Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedoms Park, a New York State Park, opened in 2012 at the southern end of the island. Four Freedoms Park was designed by Louis Kahn in 1974 and consists of two rows of trees converging toward a granite &quot;room&quot; at the island&#x27;s southern tip.

There is a smaller park located around the Blackwell House. The southern tip of Roosevelt Island was formerly occupied by the Delacorte Fountain, which was donated by publisher George T. Delacorte Jr. in mid-1967 and dedicated in 1969. The fountain sprayed water from the East River into the air. A local group planted trees at the southern tip of the island in 1985, which quickly died due to blasts from the Delacorte Fountain; the fountain was turned off in the 1980s and subsequently taken apart. The entire island is circled by a publicly accessible waterfront promenade. Because of its greenery, Roosevelt Island received a Tree City USA designation for several years in the 1990s and 2000s.

=== Recreational facilities ===
There are four outdoor recreational fields on Roosevelt Island:
* Capobianco Field, located south of the Roosevelt Island Bridge ramp; measures 
* Firefighters Field, located next to the ferry terminal north of Queensboro Bridge; measures 
* McManus Field, located across from the New York City Department of Sanitation building at the north end of the island. Originally known as Octagon Park, it contained soccer, tennis, and baseball facilities, as well as areas for picnics and barbecues. The park was renamed from Octagon Field in October 2019 to honor Jack McManus, the former Chief of the Roosevelt Island Public Safety Department.
* Pony Field, located east of the Octagon; measures 

The Roosevelt Island Racquet Club is located near the Roosevelt Island Tramway stop and was developed in the early 1990s, with 11 courts underneath a pair of domes. Also next to the tram stop is the Sportspark indoor recreation center, with a studio, swimming pool, gym, and recreation room. There are additional tennis courts in Octagon Park, next to the Octagon.

== Education ==

=== Schools and higher education ===

Roosevelt Island is served by the New York City Department of Education. When it was redeveloped as a residential community in the 1970s, the island was planned with up to 16 schools serving grades K-12, each accommodating 180 to 300 students. Roosevelt Island&#x27;s schools were spread across several apartment buildings. The school system taught fine arts as part of a partnership with Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, and each school taught a foreign language as well.

The first school on Roosevelt Island opened in 1975 with a single student and two teachers. By the 1980s, the island had five school buildings, each serving two grades. All of the island&#x27;s schools were combined in 1992 into PS/IS 217 Roosevelt Island School, which is located on Main Street. By the 21st century, PS/IS 217 was the only public school on the island, serving students from pre-kindergarten to grade 8. High-school students on the island generally went to schools in Manhattan. The Child School and Legacy High School serves special needs children with learning and emotional disabilities.

In 2011, Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced that Cornell Tech, a Cornell University-Technion-Israel Institute of Technology graduate school of applied sciences, would be built on the island. The first phase of Cornell Tech opened in 2017.

=== Library ===
The New York Public Library (NYPL) operates the Roosevelt Island branch at 504 Main Street. The library was founded in the 1970s as a volunteer initiative. Two residents, Dorothy and Herman Reade, founded the island&#x27;s first library within a rented space in 1976; the collection had moved to 625 Main Street by 1977. The Reades&#x27; library was unusual in that it used a custom classification system, rather than the Dewey Decimal Classification system, which the Reades did not know much about. The library moved to its own building at 524 Main Street in 1979 or the 1980s. The library on Main Street was named the Dorothy and Herman Reade Library of Roosevelt Island in the early 1980s. Residents originally paid dues to access the library.

The library became a branch of the NYPL system in 1998, allowing the branch to access the NYPL&#x27;s much larger collection. The Empire State Center for the Book dedicated a plaque on the island in 2016, marking the island&#x27;s literary connections. The current NYPL branch at 504 Main Street opened in January 2021 and covers .

== Religion ==
There have been churches and chapels for several Christian denominations on the island. The Chapel of the Good Shepherd, a Late Victorian Gothic style structure, was Roosevelt Island&#x27;s first church and operated until 1958 as an Episcopal church. The chapel reopened in 1975 as a community center. The Chapel of Our Lady, Consoler of the Afflicted dated to 1909 and was a Gothic-style stone building serving the island&#x27;s Catholic community. The Church of the Good Samaritan was developed for the Lutheran community in 1917. Both the Chapel of Our Lady and the Church of the Good Samaritan have since been demolished. At the Metropolitan Hospital was an Episcopal chapel, the Chapel of the Holy Spirit (consecrated 1925), and a Catholic chapel, the Chapel of the Sacred Heart.

Welfare Island originally contained the Council Synagogue, which opened in 1926 and was described as having a &quot;pleasing exterior&quot; and a &quot;simple, dignified interior&quot;. Following the residential redevelopment, the Roosevelt Island Jewish Congregation was founded ; the Chabad Lubavitch Center of Roosevelt Island moved into the RIJC&#x27;s space in 2006. Chabad of Roosevelt Island also operates a Chabad Jewish student organization in association with Cornell Tech, which accommodates many international students from Israel. There is also a mosque operated by the Islamic Society of Roosevelt Island.

== Transportation ==
Until its development in the late 20th century, Roosevelt Island was largely inaccessible from the outside world, and a guard banned most visitors, including all children under age 12. The island was accessed solely by rowboat until the early 20th century. Even through the 1950s, the only modes of transit to and from the island were a ferry from 78th Street in Manhattan and an elevator from the Queensboro Bridge.

, the island is accessible via bridge, aerial tramway, ferry, and subway. Although the tramway and subway stations are both wheelchair-accessible, both modes of transit can experience outages that occasionally make it impossible for disabled residents to travel to and from the island. Furthermore, despite the existence of several modes of transit, the island still had a reputation for being hard to access during the 21st century.

=== Pedestrian and vehicular access ===
Although Roosevelt Island is located directly under the Queensboro Bridge, it is no longer directly accessible from the bridge itself. A trolley previously connected passengers from Queens and Manhattan to a stop in the middle of the bridge, where passengers took an elevator down to the island. The trolley operated from the bridge&#x27;s opening in 1909 until April 7, 1957. An elevator building, on the bridge&#x27;s north side, was finished in 1918 or 1919. The elevator was closed to the public in 1957, after the Roosevelt Island Bridge opened, but was not demolished until 1970. As late as August 1973, another passenger elevator ran from the Queens end of the bridge to the island,

The Roosevelt Island Bridge, a vertical-lift bridge over the East River&#x27;s eastern channel to Astoria, Queens, opened in 1955. It is the only vehicular route to the island and also contains a sidewalk. News media said in 2001 that the bridge was almost never lifted, though it was lifted more frequently starting in the 2000s. There is a bike lane on the bridge.

Roosevelt Island&#x27;s main parking facility is the Motorgate Garage, which was designed by the firm of Kallman &amp; McKinnell and originally had 1,000 parking spaces. It is designed in a brutalist style, with a concrete facade, and also included the island&#x27;s first post office and fire station. There are also parking meters along Main Street, but parking is limited to 20 minutes. Since 2020, the island has also had Citi Bike bikeshare stations.

=== Mass transit ===
The New York City Subway&#x27;s 63rd Street Line was proposed in 1965 with a station directly serving the island. Service on the 63rd Street Line began in October 1989, but the line had no direct subway access to much of Queens until 2001. The line&#x27;s Roosevelt Island station (served by the ) is one of the deepest stations below sea level in the system, at more than below ground level. The BMT 60th Street Tunnel () and the IND 53rd Street Line () both pass under Roosevelt Island, without stopping, on their way between Manhattan and Queens. There are emergency exit shafts to the island from both the 53rd Street and 60th Street tunnels.

The Roosevelt Island Tramway was proposed in the 1970s after delays in the subway&#x27;s construction. It was completed in May 1976, providing access to Midtown Manhattan, and had been intended as a temporary mode of transport until the subway station opened. The tram was completely reconstructed in 2010.

When the island was being redeveloped in the 1970s, the UDC had planned to operate 20-seat electric minibuses there. , MTA Bus&#x27;s route operates between the island and Queens, making a loop around Roosevelt Island. RIOC also operates the Red Bus, a shuttle bus service that circulates around the island. The latter service is fare-free, connecting apartment buildings to the subway and tramway.

A ferry service ran from Welfare Island to Manhattan from 1935 to June 1956, although the island&#x27;s old ferry terminal remained standing for several years. A ferry route ran directly to Lower Manhattan briefly during 1986. Roosevelt Island has been served by NYC Ferry&#x27;s Astoria route since August 2017. The ferry landing is on the east side of the island near the tramway station.

<doc id="51949" wikidata="Q5194703" url="?curid=51949" title="Curelom and cumom">
<text>The curelom () and the cumom () are &quot;useful&quot; animals mentioned in the Book of Mormon. According to members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, these animals are thought to have possibly existed in North or South America. To non-adherents, these animals are solely creatures of the Book of Mormon.

The exact intended identity of these animals is not known. Joseph Smith, the reputed translator of the Book of Mormon, is not known to have elaborated on the subject of these animals.

==Reference in the Book of Mormon==
The curelom and cumom are mentioned only once in the Book of Mormon. The reference occurs in the Book of Ether, which is purported to be a history of a nation of early Americans called the &quot;Jaredites&quot; who are said to have left the Tower of Babel and traveled by barge to the Western Hemisphere. There, according to the book, they made use of a number of animals, though whether they brought them over on their barges is unclear. The narrative reads as follows:

:&quot;And also all manner of cattle, ... and also many other kinds of animals which were useful for the food of man. And they also had horses, and asses, and there were elephants and cureloms and cumoms; all of which were useful unto man, and more especially the elephants and cureloms and cumoms. &quot; ()

==Apologetic interpretation==
According to Latter-day Saint belief, Joseph Smith translated the Book of Mormon from an ancient language. In this line of thinking, the words &quot;curelom&quot; and &quot;cumom&quot; were transliterated instead of translated, meaning that while the ancient word is roughly transmitted, the actual animal intended is ambiguous. The context may imply beasts of burden. Some members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have speculated about what the terms refer to, including:

*An as yet undiscovered, probably extinct species.
*Some other North/South American animal species with which Smith was unfamiliar with including possible beasts of burden such as the llama, tapir, guanaco, or other possibly useful creatures like the alpaca, vicuña, jaguar, or monkey.

*Mastodons, mammoths, or gomphotheres. Early Latter-day Saint apostle Orson Pratt might have identified cureloms as mammoths, though the context is unclear as to whether he is talking about cureloms &quot;and&quot; mammoths or cureloms &quot;as&quot; mammoths. If he means cureloms and mammoths separately, then he is not specifically saying that mammoths existed on the American continent at that time, seeing as all the animals are meant as hypothetical examples of what the Jaredites &quot;might&quot; have brought in their barges. 
::&quot;Now to prepare them against these contingencies, and that they might, have fresh air for the benefit of the elephants, cureloms or mammoths and many other animals, that perhaps were in them, as well as the human beings they contained, the Lord told them how to construct them in order to receive air, that when they were on the top of the water, whichever side up their vessels happened to be, it mattered not; they were so constructed that they could ride safely, though bottom upwards and they could open their air holes that happened to be uppermost&quot; (Orson Pratt, &quot;Journal of Discourses&quot; 12:340).
==Critical view of the mammoth theory==
Mainstream paleontologists believe that mastodons and mammoths became extinct by 4000 BCE. This suggests that a beast of burden in the Book of Mormon time period most likely would not have been a mammoth, although many Latter-day Saints still persist in displaying cureloms as mammoths in literature and media.

Recent studies have found that a small population of mammoths existed until approximately 1650 BCE. These survivors were an isolated arctic population discovered on the remote Wrangel Island in the Arctic Ocean. This is the time period wherein Jaredites would have lived, but the geography and climate are far from matching the lands proposed by Book of Mormon scholars and apologists.

==Cureloms and Cumoms in Latter-Day Saint literature==
The curelom and cumom have appeared in Mormon literature. For example, Chris Heimerdinger, a popular LDS novelist, chose to make cureloms mammoths in his time-traveling adventure &quot;Tennis Shoes and the Feathered Serpent.&quot; Similarly, Thom Duncan published an independent novel where an Indiana Jones-type character escapes from a curelom, described as a mammoth. In another book, titled &quot;Book of Mormon ABCs&quot;, on the third page it says, &quot;C&quot; is for curelom, and it has a picture of a mammoth.

In his novel &quot;The Memory of Earth&quot;, Orson Scott Card lists various pack animals: &quot;horses, donkeys, mules and kurelomi&quot;. That particular spelling and similar alternative spellings of cureloms can be found in some non-English translations of the Book of Mormon, e.g. Slovenian.

<text>I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue is a BBC radio comedy panel game. Billed as &quot;the antidote to panel games&quot;, it consists of two teams of two comedians being given &quot;silly things to do&quot; by a chairman. The show was launched in April 1972 as a parody of radio and TV panel games, and has been broadcast since on BBC Radio 4 and the BBC World Service, with repeats aired on BBC Radio 4 Extra and, in the 1980s and 1990s, on BBC Radio 2. The 50th series was broadcast in November and December 2007.

After a period of split chairmanship in the first series, Humphrey Lyttelton (&quot;Humph&quot;) served in this role from the programme&#x27;s inception until his hospitalisation and subsequent death in 2008, which led to the cancellation of the 2008 series. The show recommenced on 15 June 2009 with Lyttelton replaced by three hosts: Stephen Fry, Jack Dee and Rob Brydon. Dee went on to host all episodes of the 52nd series later that year, and continues in that role. The chairman&#x27;s script was most recently written by Iain Pattinson, who worked on the show from 1992 until his death in 2021.

==History==

&quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot; developed from the long-running radio sketch show &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry, I&#x27;ll Read That Again&quot;, the writers of which were John Cleese, Jo Kendall, David Hatch, The Goodies trio Bill Oddie, Tim Brooke-Taylor and especially Graeme Garden who suggested the idea of an unscripted show which, it was decided, would take the form of a parody panel game. A panel game with no competition was not itself a new idea: the BBC had a history of successful quiz shows designed to allow witty celebrities to entertain where winning was not important. Examples include &quot;Ignorance Is Bliss&quot;, &quot;Just a Minute&quot;, &quot;My Word!&quot; and &quot;My Music&quot; on the radio and &quot;Call My Bluff&quot; on television.

The pilot episode (at that time titled &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry, They&#x27;re At It Again&quot;) opened with Graeme Garden and Jo Kendall singing the words of &quot;Three Blind Mice&quot; to the tune of &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot; followed by Bill Oddie and Tim Brooke-Taylor performing the lyrics of &quot;Sing a Song of Sixpence&quot; to the melody of &quot;These Foolish Things&quot;. Dave Lee, who was bandleader on &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry, I&#x27;ll Read That Again&quot;, was at the piano and a number of rounds were introduced by a short phrase of music. Other rounds included &quot;Dialogue Read in a Specific Accent&quot; and &quot;Songs Sung as Animals&quot;. In 1974 Bill Oddie was replaced by Willie Rushton, with Barry Cryer replacing Jo Kendall as Graeme Garden&#x27;s teammate, and Humphrey Lyttelton as chairman, and the personnel remained constant from this point until Rushton&#x27;s death in 1996, although occasional guest panellists appeared in the 1980s and early 1990s (see below). Since then the panel has featured a variety of guest comedians.

The show has over two million listeners on Radio 4 and its recording sessions typically fill 1,500-seat theatres within a week of being advertised. At least one recording for the spring 2006 series filled all its seats within three hours of the free tickets being made available, and the London recording of the autumn series in that year sold out in ten minutes. Although there are twelve &quot;Clue&quot; shows broadcast per year these are the result of just six recording sessions, with two programmes being recorded back-to-back. The show was recently voted the second funniest radio programme ever, after &quot;The Goon Show&quot;. It has a large following among professional comedians such as Armando Iannucci, who turned down opportunities to work on it as he preferred to remain a listener.

The official, authorised history of the show and ISIRTA, &quot;The Clue Bible&quot; by Jem Roberts, was published by Preface Publishing in October 2009.

==Participants==
===Chairman===
Humphrey Lyttelton, primarily known as a jazz trumpeter and bandleader, and known as Humph to his friends, was invited to be chairman because of the role played by improvisation in both comedy and jazz music. In the first series Lyttelton shared the role of chairman with Barry Cryer but he made it his own (especially once Cryer replaced Cleese as a regular panellist) and continued as chairman until his death on 25 April 2008. He read the script introducing the programme and segments in an utterly deadpan manner. He claimed the secret was just to read what was in front of him without understanding why it was funny. He adopted the grumpy persona of someone who would really rather be somewhere else, which he attributed to worrying that, surrounded by four professional comedians, he would have nothing worthwhile to chip in. He did occasionally depart from the script, however, often bringing the house down with an ad-lib. He was credited by the regular panellists as being the chief reason for the show&#x27;s longevity.

On 18 April 2008 the producer of &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t A Clue&quot;, Jon Naismith, announced that, owing to hospitalisation to repair an aortic aneurysm, Humphrey Lyttelton would be unable to record the scheduled shows and that they would have to be postponed. The final show of the 2008 &quot;Best of&quot; tour on 22 April would be presented by Rob Brydon. Following Lyttelton&#x27;s death there was speculation that the series might be cancelled because replacing him would be extremely difficult if not impossible. In a eulogy in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Barry Cryer did not allude to the future of the programme but said that there&#x27;s &quot;got to be an agonising reappraisal&quot; and that Lyttelton was the &quot;very hub of the show&quot;. Cryer, Tim Brooke-Taylor and Graeme Garden all ruled themselves out as hosts: Cryer did not think the programme would work if a panellist became chairman and it &quot;would need somebody of stature to be parachuted in&quot;. Jeremy Hardy also ruled himself out, saying &quot;Humph had big shoes to fill and I wouldn&#x27;t do it.&quot;

In the &quot;Clue&quot; mailout for September 2008 Naismith stated: &quot;Despite the rumours, we&#x27;ve made no decisions about possible replacements for Humph, and are unlikely to make any decisions this year at least. Certainly I don&#x27;t envisage us selecting anyone on a permanent basis for several series.&quot; It was announced that the show would continue recording beginning in 2009. The first new shows would be hosted by rotating guest presenters (similarly to the format of &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;) before a permanent replacement host was decided. In the &quot;Clue&quot; mailout for February 2009 Naismith announced that Stephen Fry, Jack Dee and Rob Brydon would host two shows each, to be recorded in April, May and June 2009 respectively. The programme returned on 15 June 2009, chaired by Fry with the usual panellists and special guest Victoria Wood. Every series since then has been chaired by Dee.

===Panellists===
The regular panellists for much of the show&#x27;s history were:
*Graeme Garden was a member of the &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry, I&#x27;ll Read That Again&quot; team from which the programme grew and has been a panellist since the first episode. Lyttelton described him as very dry, biding his time before stepping in with a perfect punchline. Garden was absent from January 2016 for the whole of series 65, 66 and 67. On 12 October 2017, Garden announced that he would be rejoining the team, but has only appeared infrequently since then. Following the death of Barry Cryer, Garden is the last surviving original panellist.
*Barry Cryer hosted six episodes in the show&#x27;s first series before moving to a permanent seat on the panel. He was credited by then-chairman Lyttelton as being the show&#x27;s &quot;bricks and mortar&quot;, providing quick-fire one-liners in any situation. There is a running joke in the programme that he is a dirty old man with a drink problem. He died aged 86 in January 2022.
*Tim Brooke-Taylor was also part of the &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry, I&#x27;ll Read That Again&quot; team and was also with the show from the start until his death in April 2020. He was very popular with the crowd and adopted a vulnerable persona. Garden and Brooke-Taylor had previously worked together on television in &quot;The Goodies&quot; alongside Bill Oddie and Brooke-Taylor in particular would occasionally drop references to that show into some of the games, eliciting cheers from the audience.
*Willie Rushton was one of the regular panel members from 1974 until his death in 1996. The other panellists have fond memories of his off-the-wall sense of humour and quick-fire puns. Since Rushton&#x27;s death his seat has been turned into a permanent guest spot, which was often filled by the late Jeremy Hardy when on non-broadcast tours. Guests have also appeared when one of the regulars was unavailable.
*Tony Hawks, after appearing as a guest for one recording a series for many series, started appearing in multiple recordings per series from series 80 onwards and became a semi-regular panellist of the show.

===Producers===
The show has had a number of producers over the years:
*David Hatch (produced only the pilot episode in 1972)
*John Cassels (1972–74)
*Simon Brett (1975–77)
*Geoffrey Perkins (1978–81)
*Paul Mayhew-Archer (1982–86)
*Paul Spencer (1987–89)
*Jon Magnusson (1990–91)
*Jon Naismith (1991–present)

===Musical accompaniment===
Early episodes featured Dave Lee, who provided piano accompaniment on &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry, I&#x27;ll Read That Again&quot;. However, Colin Sell now usually fills this role. He is often the butt of jokes about his musical ability, to which he is unable to respond as he has no microphone. For example: &quot;When music experts hear Colin&#x27;s compositions, they say he could have been another Berlin, Porter or anybody else employed by the German State Railway.&quot; Guest pianists are called in when Sell has been unable to attend (or the &quot;ISIHAC&quot; team have &quot;won the coin toss&quot; as Lyttelton once said on the show), including Neil Innes, Denis King and Matthew Scott. Lyttelton&#x27;s band also appeared on a couple of Christmas specials. On one occasion when Innes was guesting, Lyttelton outlined the musician&#x27;s career, concluding that this &quot;has brought him to where he is today: standing in for Colin Sell.&quot; In another appearance Innes sang along to his own composition &quot;I&#x27;m the Urban Spaceman&quot; during a round of &quot;Pick Up Song&quot;.

The theme music is called &quot;The Schickel Shamble&quot;, by Ron Goodwin, and is from the film &quot;Monte Carlo or Bust!&quot; It was chosen by David Hatch.

===Scorers===
Since 18 May 1985 (in the episode in which Kenny Everett made his debut), the show has included a fictional and completely silent scorer &quot;whose job is eased by the fact no points are actually awarded&quot;. Usually this is &quot;the lovely Samantha&quot;, who sits on Humph&#x27;s left hand. There is a seat with a microphone next to the Chairman which is &quot;used&quot; by Samantha. During the introductory music, Humphrey Lyttelton would stand up and &quot;help&quot; Samantha into her seat. In practice, the seat and microphone were only used by the producer to welcome the audience, to introduce the participants and to give any other information to the audience such as the expected date of broadcasting, and to supervise re-recordings of fluffs made in the programme.

Lyttelton would describe Samantha&#x27;s social activities, usually in an apology received from the unseen character who had been detained, often with a &quot;gentleman friend&quot;. His comments included sexual innuendo and double entendres, like &quot;Samantha likes nothing better than a little potter in the woodshed in the morning&quot;, though many were far more daring and explicit. During early episodes of Samantha&#x27;s appearance on the show, it was not completely clear that she was a fictional character, garnering complaints about the sexist and humiliating treatment she received. Producer Jon Naismith recalled &quot;when we [Naismith and Iain Pattinson] took over the show we used to get quite a few letters accusing us of sexist references to Samantha&quot; (the character was named after the page 3 topless model Samantha Fox). Samantha&#x27;s inabilities as score-keeper often form the basis for humour; in a programme from 1997, Humph said: &quot;It&#x27;s just occurred to me that Samantha hasn&#x27;t given us the score... since 1981.&quot;

Samantha has sometimes been replaced by a Swedish stand-in, Sven, or occasionally another substitute, Monica. When Margaret Thatcher left office in 1990 Lyttelton introduced a scorer named Margaret. In an episode in November 1991 both Samantha and Sven were present but occupied with each other and unable to award points.

The programme&#x27;s scoring is completely non-existent. Most of the show is scripted, but in rounds such as &quot;Sound charades&quot;, where one team of panellists have to guess the charade of the other team, the answer may be obvious (usually a pun) but the opposing team are not told the answer. In recording, it has taken them many minutes to come up with the correct answer, most of which has to be edited out before broadcast.

In rounds in which the panel must not see what the audience sees, there is the &quot;advanced laser display-board&quot; (in reality, a sign with the answer written on, held by Jon Naismith). These boards are sometimes described in more elaborate terms and as &quot;so generously funded by our hosts&quot;. The names and phrases on them are conveyed to &quot;listeners at home&quot; by the &quot;mystery voice&quot;, alluding to the 1960s radio programme &quot;Twenty Questions&quot;.

===Correspondence===
A regular feature on the programme, preceding the game Mornington Crescent, is a fictional letters section which begins with the chairman&#x27;s comments (&quot;I notice from the sheer weight of this week&#x27;s postbag, we&#x27;ve received a little over no letters&quot; and &quot;I see from the number of letters raining down on us this week that the Scrabble factory has exploded again&quot;). The invariably single letter each week is from &quot;A Mrs Trellis of North Wales&quot; (one of the many prompts for a cheer from the audience), whose incoherent letters usually mistake the chairman for another Radio 4 presenter or media personality. &quot;Dear Libby&quot; (she writes), &quot;why oh why ... very nearly spells YOYO&quot;, or &quot;Dear Mr Titchmarsh, never let them tell you that size isn&#x27;t important. My aunt told me that, but then all my new wallpaper fell off.&quot;

==Format==
===Introduction===
The chairman introduces the show by introducing the place where they are recording from and giving factoids which will lead to a punchline and introducing the teams and the scorer for the evening alternating between Samantha and Sven.

===Games===

Many games are played on &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot;, some frequently and dozens less often. A few have been played only once, either because the joke works only once or because they were not particularly successful. Popular games include &quot;One Song to the Tune of Another&quot;, &quot;Mornington Crescent&quot;, &quot;Sound Charades&quot;, &quot;Late Arrivals&quot;, &quot;Double Feature&quot;, &quot;Cheddar Gorge&quot; and &quot;Uxbridge English Dictionary&quot;. &quot;One Song to the Tune of Another&quot; is always introduced using a complex analogy, despite its self-explanatory title, often ending with a joke at the expense of Colin Sell. 
Most episodes follow a format, and the same games are played in sequence in most series. The first, third and fifth episodes of a series (recorded first of two shows in each location) usually includes &quot;One Song to the Tune of Another&quot; as its second round, and the alternate episodes feature &quot;Pick-up Song&quot; in the same slot. &quot;Uxbridge English Dictionary&quot; usually begins the second recording session, and the same session will usually include &quot;Mornington Crescent&quot;. &quot;Sound Charades&quot; is typically featured in the odd-numbered episodes. This pattern is more consistent in later episodes. 

The panellists play as individuals or as two teams. &quot;Celebrity What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; completely destroyed the intent of the original — for players to guess the occupation of a third party by asking yes/no questions. The &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot; version once employed the famous actress (and fan of the show) Dame Judi Dench in this role and the renowned television gardener Alan Titchmarsh. Each began by performing a mime illustrating their occupation, giving a cryptic clue to the panel (appearing to a radio listener as a short silence punctuated by exclamations from the panel and laughter from the studio audience), before fielding apparently serious questions from the teams (e.g. &quot;Is that your own hair?&quot; or &quot;Do you kill people for money?&quot;), who pretended not to know who they were.

Musical games often involve incongruities such as singing &quot;One Song to the Tune of Another&quot; or playing a song using only a swanee whistle and a kazoo. In &quot;Just a Minim&quot; – a parody of Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Just a Minute&quot; – panellists must sing a specified song avoiding repetition, deviation, or hesitation: the chosen songs often have extremely repetitive lyrics.

Humour is derived from wordplay such as puns or mockery of styles of speech. For example, in a round based on suggesting television programmes from biblical times:
*&quot;They Think It&#x27;s All Jehovah&quot;
*&quot;I Love Lucifer&quot;
*&quot;The Exodus Files&quot;

In &quot;Uxbridge English Dictionary&quot; the panellists contribute humorous redefinitions of words; &quot;Puny: the Roman Catholic equivalent of tennis elbow&quot;. More puns are found in the &quot;Arrivals at the Ball&quot; section, of the form &quot;Mr and Mrs X and their son (or daughter)...&quot; the child&#x27;s name forming a pun, preferably laboured and feeble. This grew out of the &quot;drama&quot; section of later shows in the &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry, I&#x27;ll Read That Again&quot; series, for example, at the Criminals&#x27; Ball, &quot;Mr and Mrs Knee, and their Swedish son, Lars Knee&quot;.

According to Tim Brooke-Taylor, twenty per cent of the show is ad-libbed. According to Willie Rushton, it is more like fifty per cent, but he didn&#x27;t think that a bad thing.

===Time, destiny, fate and eternity===
The show draws to a close with the chairman imparting some final words of wisdom intended to evoke time, destiny, fate and eternity, undercut with silliness. For example: &quot;...And so, as the hunter of time blasts the moose of eternity, and the dairy counter worker of fate sighs and grabs her mop...&quot; Lyttelton&#x27;s final sign-off on the show, shortly before his death in April 2008, was: 
==Humour==
Most of the humour is detached from the real world. Steve Punt cites it as one of his favourite radio shows because &quot;there&#x27;s no points being made or targets being attacked.&quot; Contemporary references occasionally made by participants are usually asides. The show does occasionally comment on the outside world, though from an innocent perspective. The game &quot;Complete George Bush Quotes&quot; was once played, in which the teams had to supply endings for phrases that George Bush had begun (see Bushism), the teams complaining that they couldn&#x27;t be any funnier than the original; similar rounds with guessing or completing quotes of other well-known public figures and personalities have also been played.

The regular panellists are represented by the chairman to be unfunny, struggling comedians who have been doing the same act for many years. The supposed personalities of the panellists as demonstrated by the chairman, fictitious but drawn from their public personas, is also a recurring theme. Barry Cryer was often represented as a tight-fisted alcoholic who could not wait to get to the pub (but who never bought a round of drinks), while Tim Brooke-Taylor was often represented as willing to take any small performance job in his quiet career and always campaigning for repeats of &quot;The Goodies&quot; (something which Brooke-Taylor himself played upon in many rounds). Humphrey Lyttelton often delivered mock comments of how boring and low quality the show was and, particularly in his later years on the show, preferring to doze off rather than listen to the rounds. Pianist Colin Sell, meanwhile, is often the butt of jokes regarding his supposedly terrible musical skills (despite in reality being an accomplished musician). 

According to Willie Rushton, &quot;The show gets quite filthy at times, but the audience love it.&quot;
After fifty years on the air, one of the most important aspects of the show is its huge stock of running gags which, if not always funny in themselves, can elicit huge anticipatory laughter from the studio audience. The mere mention of Lionel Blair often brought roars of laughter in anticipation of an outrageous double-entendre based on his supposed homosexuality (he was not gay). Similarly, particular mention of points scorer Samantha or her male replacement Sven (neither of whom actually exists) will typically bring anticipatory laughter in anticipation of a sexual double-entendre.

In the &quot;Film Club&quot; round, any reference by Graeme Garden to &quot;Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia&quot; is sure to cause a similar response. The game &quot;Wobbling Bunnies&quot; was introduced several times by Humph, often with eager anticipation by the panel and audience, but time pressures always meant the game was never actually played. Graeme Garden and Barry Cryer frequently played the characters of two Scots, Hamish and Dougal, whose skits usually began with the phrase &quot;You&#x27;ll have had your tea?&quot;, as a stereotypical Scots miser when receiving a guest never offers any food or drink. The characters were developed into their own Radio 4 show, &quot;Hamish and Dougal&quot;, which also featured Jeremy Hardy. Another long-running gag involves one of the panellists putting forward a challenge of &quot;hesitation&quot; when another panellist leaves a long pause in the middle of speaking, a reference to another long-running Radio 4 panel show, &quot;Just a Minute&quot;. (Likewise, occasionally on &quot;Just a Minute&quot;, a panellist will make a challenge of &quot;Mornington Crescent&quot;.) Chairman Humphrey Lyttelton frequently poked fun at &quot;Just a Minute&quot; and its chairman Nicholas Parsons. Lyttelton&#x27;s successor, Jack Dee, continued with and expanded upon this, mimicking Parsons while he was still alive by constantly emphasising the long experience of some panellists, and the fact that the programme can be heard all over the world.

<text>Distributions, also known as Schwartz distributions or [[generalized function]]s, are objects that generalize the classical notion of functions in mathematical analysis. Distributions make it possible to differentiate functions whose derivatives do not exist in the classical sense. In particular, any locally integrable function has a distributional derivative.

Distributions are widely used in the theory of partial differential equations, where it may be easier to establish the existence of distributional solutions (weak solutions) than classical solutions, or where appropriate classical solutions may not exist. Distributions are also important in physics and engineering where many problems naturally lead to differential equations whose solutions or initial conditions are singular, such as the Dirac delta function.

A function formula_1 is normally thought of as on the in the function domain by &quot;sending&quot; a point formula_2 in the domain to the point formula_3 Instead of acting on points, distribution theory reinterprets functions such as formula_1 as acting on in a certain way. In applications to physics and engineering,  are usually infinitely differentiable complex-valued (or real-valued) functions with compact support that are defined on some given non-empty open subset formula_5. (Bump functions are examples of test functions.) The set of all such test functions forms a vector space that is denoted by formula_6 or formula_7

Most commonly encountered functions, including all continuous maps formula_8 if using formula_9 can be canonically reinterpreted as acting via &quot;integration against a test function.&quot; Explicitly, this means that such a function formula_1 &quot;acts on&quot; a test function formula_11 by &quot;sending&quot; it to the number formula_12 which is often denoted by formula_13 This new action formula_14 of formula_1 defines a scalar-valued map formula_16 whose domain is the space of test functions formula_17 This functional formula_18 turns out to have the two defining properties of what is known as a : it is linear, and it is also continuous when formula_19 is given a certain topology called . The action (the integration formula_20) of this distribution formula_18 on a test function formula_22 can be interpreted as a weighted average of the distribution on the support of the test function, even if the values of the distribution at a single point are not well-defined. Distributions like formula_18 that arise from functions in this way are prototypical examples of distributions, but there exist many distributions that cannot be defined by integration against any function. Examples of the latter include the Dirac delta function and distributions defined to act by integration of test functions formula_24 against certain measures formula_25 on formula_26 Nonetheless, it is still always possible to reduce any arbitrary distribution down to a simpler of related distributions that do arise via such actions of integration.

More generally, a is by definition a linear functional on formula_6 that is continuous when formula_6 is given a topology called the . This leads to space of (all) distributions on formula_29, usually denoted by formula_30 (note the prime), which by definition is the space of all distributions on formula_29 (that is, it is the continuous dual space of formula_6); it is these distributions that are the main focus of this article.

Definitions of the appropriate topologies on spaces of test functions and distributions are given in the article on spaces of test functions and distributions. This article is primarily concerned with the definition of distributions, together with their properties and some important examples.

==History==

The practical use of distributions can be traced back to the use of Green&#x27;s functions in the 1830s to solve ordinary differential equations, but was not formalized until much later. According to , generalized functions originated in the work of on second-order hyperbolic partial differential equations, and the ideas were developed in somewhat extended form by Laurent Schwartz in the late 1940s. According to his autobiography, Schwartz introduced the term &quot;distribution&quot; by analogy with a distribution of electrical charge, possibly including not only point charges but also dipoles and so on. comments that although the ideas in the transformative book by were not entirely new, it was Schwartz&#x27;s broad attack and conviction that distributions would be useful almost everywhere in analysis that made the difference. A detailed history of the theory of distributions was given by .

==Notation==

The following notation will be used throughout this article:

* formula_33 is a fixed positive integer and formula_29 is a fixed non-empty open subset of Euclidean space formula_35
* formula_36 denotes the natural numbers.
* formula_37 will denote a non-negative integer or formula_38
* If formula_1 is a function then formula_40 will denote its domain and the of formula_41 denoted by formula_42 is defined to be the closure of the set formula_43 in formula_44
* For two functions formula_45 the following notation defines a canonical pairing: formula_46
* A of size formula_33 is an element in formula_48 (given that formula_33 is fixed, if the size of multi-indices is omitted then the size should be assumed to be formula_33). The of a multi-index formula_51 is defined as formula_52 and denoted by formula_53 Multi-indices are particularly useful when dealing with functions of several variables, in particular, we introduce the following notations for a given multi-index formula_51: formula_55
The Lemma combined with the fact that the formal transpose of the formal transpose is the original differential operator, that is, formula_56 enables us to arrive at the correct definition: the formal transpose induces the (continuous) canonical linear operator formula_57 defined by formula_58 We claim that the transpose of this map, formula_59 can be taken as formula_60 To see this, for every formula_61 compute its action on a distribution of the form formula_18 with formula_63:

formula_64

We call the continuous linear operator formula_65 the . Its action on an arbitrary distribution formula_66 is defined via:
formula_67

If formula_68 converges to formula_69 then for every multi-index formula_70 converges to formula_71

====Multiplication of distributions by smooth functions====

A differential operator of order 0 is just multiplication by a smooth function. And conversely, if formula_1 is a smooth function then formula_73 is a differential operator of order 0, whose formal transpose is itself (that is, formula_74). The induced differential operator formula_75 maps a distribution formula_76 to a distribution denoted by formula_77 We have thus defined the multiplication of a distribution by a smooth function.

We now give an alternative presentation of the multiplication of a distribution formula_76 on formula_29 by a smooth function formula_80 The product formula_81 is defined by
formula_82

This definition coincides with the transpose definition since if formula_83 is the operator of multiplication by the function formula_84 (that is, formula_85), then
formula_86
so that formula_87

Under multiplication by smooth functions, formula_30 is a module over the ring formula_89 With this definition of multiplication by a smooth function, the ordinary product rule of calculus remains valid. However, some unusual identities also arise. For example, if formula_90 is the Dirac delta distribution on formula_91 then formula_92 and if formula_93 is the derivative of the delta distribution, then
formula_94

The bilinear multiplication map formula_95 given by formula_96 is continuous; it is however, hypocontinuous.

Example. The product of any distribution formula_76 with the function that is identically on formula_29 is equal to formula_99

Example. Suppose formula_100 is a sequence of test functions on formula_29 that converges to the constant function formula_102 For any distribution formula_76 on formula_104 the sequence formula_105 converges to formula_106

If formula_68 converges to formula_69 and formula_100 converges to formula_63 then formula_111 converges to formula_112

=====Problem of multiplying distributions=====

It is easy to define the product of a distribution with a smooth function, or more generally the product of two distributions whose singular supports are disjoint. With more effort, it is possible to define a well-behaved product of several distributions provided their wave front sets at each point are compatible. A limitation of the theory of distributions (and hyperfunctions) is that there is no associative product of two distributions extending the product of a distribution by a smooth function, as has been proved by Laurent Schwartz in the 1950s. For example, if formula_113 is the distribution obtained by the Cauchy principal value
formula_114

If formula_90 is the Dirac delta distribution then
formula_116
but,
formula_117
so the product of a distribution by a smooth function (which is always well-defined) cannot be extended to an associative product on the space of distributions.

Thus, nonlinear problems cannot be posed in general and thus are not solved within distribution theory alone. In the context of quantum field theory, however, solutions can be found. In more than two spacetime dimensions the problem is related to the regularization of divergences. Here Henri Epstein and Vladimir Glaser developed the mathematically rigorous (but extremely technical) . This does not solve the problem in other situations. Many other interesting theories are non-linear, like for example the Navier–Stokes equations of fluid dynamics.

Several not entirely satisfactory theories of algebras of generalized functions have been developed, among which Colombeau&#x27;s (simplified) algebra is maybe the most popular in use today.

Inspired by Lyons&#x27; rough path theory, Martin Hairer proposed a consistent way of multiplying distributions with certain structures (regularity structures), available in many examples from stochastic analysis, notably stochastic partial differential equations. See also Gubinelli–Imkeller–Perkowski (2015) for a related development based on Bony&#x27;s paraproduct from Fourier analysis.

===Composition with a smooth function===

Let formula_76 be a distribution on formula_26 Let formula_120 be an open set in formula_121 and formula_122 If formula_123 is a submersion then it is possible to define
formula_124

This is , and is also called , sometimes written
formula_125

The pullback is often denoted formula_126 although this notation should not be confused with the use of &#x27;*&#x27; to denote the adjoint of a linear mapping.

The condition that formula_123 be a submersion is equivalent to the requirement that the Jacobian derivative formula_128 of formula_123 is a surjective linear map for every formula_130 A necessary (but not sufficient) condition for extending formula_131 to distributions is that formula_123 be an open mapping. The Inverse function theorem ensures that a submersion satisfies this condition.

If formula_123 is a submersion, then formula_131 is defined on distributions by finding the transpose map. The uniqueness of this extension is guaranteed since formula_131 is a continuous linear operator on formula_7 Existence, however, requires using the change of variables formula, the inverse function theorem (locally), and a partition of unity argument.

In the special case when formula_123 is a diffeomorphism from an open subset formula_120 of formula_121 onto an open subset formula_29 of formula_121 change of variables under the integral gives:
formula_142

In this particular case, then, formula_131 is defined by the transpose formula:
formula_144

===Convolution===

Under some circumstances, it is possible to define the convolution of a function with a distribution, or even the convolution of two distributions.
Recall that if formula_1 and formula_146 are functions on formula_121 then we denote by formula_148 defined at formula_149 to be the integral
formula_150
provided that the integral exists. If formula_151 are such that formula_152 then for any functions formula_153 and formula_154 we have formula_155 and formula_156 If formula_1 and formula_146 are continuous functions on formula_159 at least one of which has compact support, then formula_160 and if formula_161 then the value of formula_148 on formula_163 do depend on the values of formula_1 outside of the Minkowski sum formula_165

Importantly, if formula_166 has compact support then for any formula_167 the convolution map formula_168 is continuous when considered as the map formula_169 or as the map formula_170

====Translation and symmetry====

Given formula_171 the translation operator formula_172 sends formula_173 to formula_174 defined by formula_175 This can be extended by the transpose to distributions in the following way: given a distribution formula_176 is the distribution formula_177 defined by formula_178

Given formula_179 define the function formula_180 by formula_181 Given a distribution formula_176 let formula_183 be the distribution defined by formula_184 The operator formula_185 is called .

====Convolution of a test function with a distribution====

Convolution with formula_186 defines a linear map:
formula_187
which is continuous with respect to the canonical LF space topology on formula_188

Convolution of formula_1 with a distribution formula_190 can be defined by taking the transpose of formula_191 relative to the duality pairing of formula_192 with the space formula_193 of distributions. If formula_194 then by Fubini&#x27;s theorem
formula_195

Extending by continuity, the convolution of formula_1 with a distribution formula_76 is defined by
formula_198

An alternative way to define the convolution of a test function formula_1 and a distribution formula_76 is to use the translation operator formula_201 The convolution of the compactly supported function formula_1 and the distribution formula_76 is then the function defined for each formula_149 by
formula_205

It can be shown that the convolution of a smooth, compactly supported function and a distribution is a smooth function. If the distribution formula_76 has compact support, and if formula_1 is a polynomial (resp. an exponential function, an analytic function, the restriction of an entire analytic function on formula_208 to formula_159 the restriction of an entire function of exponential type in formula_208 to formula_121), then the same is true of formula_212 If the distribution formula_76 has compact support as well, then formula_214 is a compactly supported function, and the Titchmarsh convolution theorem implies that:
formula_215
where formula_216 denotes the convex hull and formula_217 denotes the support.

====Convolution of a smooth function with a distribution====

Let formula_218 and formula_190 and assume that at least one of formula_1 and formula_76 has compact support. The of formula_1 and formula_176 denoted by formula_224 or by formula_225 is the smooth function:
formula_226
satisfying for all formula_227:
formula_228

Let formula_229 be the map formula_230. If formula_76 is a distribution, then formula_229 is continuous as a map formula_233. If formula_76 also has compact support, then formula_229 is also continuous as the map formula_236 and continuous as the map formula_237

If formula_238 is a continuous linear map such that formula_239 for all formula_240 and all formula_241 then there exists a distribution formula_190 such that formula_243 for all formula_244

Example. Let formula_245 be the Heaviside function on formula_246 For any formula_247
formula_248

Let formula_90 be the Dirac measure at 0 and let formula_250 be its derivative as a distribution. Then formula_251 and formula_252 Importantly, the associative law fails to hold:
formula_253

====Convolution of distributions====

It is also possible to define the convolution of two distributions formula_66 and formula_76 on formula_159 provided one of them has compact support. Informally, to define formula_257 where formula_76 has compact support, the idea is to extend the definition of the convolution formula_259 to a linear operation on distributions so that the associativity formula
formula_260
continues to hold for all test functions formula_261

It is also possible to provide a more explicit characterization of the convolution of distributions. Suppose that formula_66 and formula_76 are distributions and that formula_66 has compact support. Then the linear maps
formula_265
are continuous. The transposes of these maps:
formula_266
are consequently continuous and it can also be shown that
formula_267

This common value is called and it is a distribution that is denoted by formula_257 or formula_269 It satisfies formula_270 If formula_66 and formula_76 are two distributions, at least one of which has compact support, then for any formula_171 formula_274 If formula_76 is a distribution in formula_121 and if formula_90 is a Dirac measure then formula_278; thus formula_90 is the identity element of the convolution operation. Moreover, if formula_1 is a function then formula_281 where now the associativity of convolution implies that formula_282 for all functions formula_1 and formula_284

Suppose that it is formula_76 that has compact support. For formula_241 consider the function
formula_287

It can be readily shown that this defines a smooth function of formula_288 which moreover has compact support. The convolution of formula_66 and formula_76 is defined by
formula_291

This generalizes the classical notion of convolution of functions and is compatible with differentiation in the following sense: for every multi-index formula_292
formula_293

The convolution of a finite number of distributions, all of which (except possibly one) have compact support, is associative.

This definition of convolution remains valid under less restrictive assumptions about formula_66 and formula_99

The convolution of distributions with compact support induces a continuous bilinear map formula_296 defined by formula_297 where formula_298 denotes the space of distributions with compact support. However, the convolution map as a function formula_299 is continuous although it is separately continuous. The convolution maps formula_300 and formula_301 given by formula_302 both to be continuous. Each of these non-continuous maps is, however, separately continuous and hypocontinuous.

====Convolution versus multiplication====

In general, regularity is required for multiplication products, and locality is required for convolution products. It is expressed in the following extension of the Convolution Theorem which guarantees the existence of both convolution and multiplication products. Let formula_303 be a rapidly decreasing tempered distribution or, equivalently, formula_304 be an ordinary (slowly growing, smooth) function within the space of tempered distributions and let formula_123 be the normalized (unitary, ordinary frequency) Fourier transform. Then, according to ,
formula_306
hold within the space of tempered distributions. In particular, these equations become the Poisson Summation Formula if formula_307 is the Dirac Comb. The space of all rapidly decreasing tempered distributions is also called the space of formula_308 and the space of all ordinary functions within the space of tempered distributions is also called the space of formula_309 More generally, formula_310 and formula_311 A particular case is the Paley-Wiener-Schwartz Theorem which states that formula_312 and formula_313 This is because formula_314 and formula_315 In other words, compactly supported tempered distributions formula_298 belong to the space of formula_308 and
Paley-Wiener functions formula_318 better known as bandlimited functions, belong to the space of formula_309

For example, let formula_320 be the Dirac comb and formula_321 be the Dirac delta;then formula_322 is the function that is constantly one and both equations yield the Dirac-comb identity. Another example is to let formula_146 be the Dirac comb and formula_324 be the rectangular function; then formula_325 is the sinc function and both equations yield the Classical Sampling Theorem for suitable formula_326 functions. More generally, if formula_146 is the Dirac comb and formula_328 is a smooth window function (Schwartz function), for example, the Gaussian, then formula_329 is another smooth window function (Schwartz function). They are known as mollifiers, especially in partial differential equations theory, or as regularizers in physics because they allow turning generalized functions into regular functions.

===Tensor products of distributions===

Let formula_330 and formula_331 be open sets. Assume all vector spaces to be over the field formula_332 where formula_333 or formula_334 For formula_335 define for every formula_336 and every formula_337 the following functions:
formula_338

Given formula_339 and formula_340 define the following functions:
formula_341
where formula_342 and formula_343 
These definitions associate every formula_344 and formula_345 with the (respective) continuous linear map:
formula_346

Moreover, if either formula_66 (resp. formula_76) has compact support then it also induces a continuous linear map of formula_349 (resp. 

 denoted by formula_350 or formula_351 is the distribution in formula_352 defined by:
formula_353

==Spaces of distributions==

For all formula_354 and all formula_355 every one of the following canonical injections is continuous and has an image (also called the range) that is a dense subset of its codomain:
formula_356
where the topologies on formula_357 (formula_358) are defined as direct limits of the spaces formula_359 in a manner analogous to how the topologies on formula_360 were defined (so in particular, they are not the usual norm topologies). The range of each of the maps above (and of any composition of the maps above) is dense in its codomain.

Suppose that formula_361 is one of the spaces formula_360 (for formula_363) or formula_364 (for formula_365) or formula_366 (for formula_367). Because the canonical injection formula_368 is a continuous injection whose image is dense in the codomain, this map&#x27;s transpose formula_369 is a continuous injection. This injective transpose map thus allows the continuous dual space formula_370 of formula_361 to be identified with a certain vector subspace of the space formula_30 of all distributions (specifically, it is identified with the image of this transpose map). This transpose map is continuous but it is necessarily a topological embedding.
A linear subspace of formula_30 carrying a locally convex topology that is finer than the subspace topology induced on it by formula_374 is called .
Almost all of the spaces of distributions mentioned in this article arise in this way (for example, tempered distribution, restrictions, distributions of order formula_375 some integer, distributions induced by a positive Radon measure, distributions induced by an formula_376-function, etc.) and any representation theorem about the continuous dual space of formula_361 may, through the transpose formula_378 be transferred directly to elements of the space formula_379

===Radon measures===

The inclusion map formula_380 is a continuous injection whose image is dense in its codomain, so the transpose formula_381 is also a continuous injection.

Note that the continuous dual space formula_382 can be identified as the space of Radon measures, where there is a one-to-one correspondence between the continuous linear functionals formula_383 and integral with respect to a Radon measure; that is,

* if formula_383 then there exists a Radon measure formula_25 on such that for all formula_386 and
* if formula_25 is a Radon measure on then the linear functional on formula_388 defined by sending formula_389 to formula_390 is continuous.

Through the injection formula_391 every Radon measure becomes a distribution on . If formula_1 is a locally integrable function on then the distribution formula_393 is a Radon measure; so Radon measures form a large and important space of distributions.

The following is the theorem of the structure of distributions of Radon measures, which shows that every Radon measure can be written as a sum of derivatives of locally formula_394 functions on :

====Positive Radon measures====

A linear function formula_76 on a space of functions is called if whenever a function formula_1 that belongs to the domain of formula_76 is non-negative (that is, formula_1 is real-valued and formula_399) then formula_400 One may show that every positive linear functional on formula_388 is necessarily continuous (that is, necessarily a Radon measure). 
Lebesgue measure is an example of a positive Radon measure.

====Locally integrable functions as distributions====

One particularly important class of Radon measures are those that are induced locally integrable functions. The function formula_402 is called if it is Lebesgue integrable over every compact subset of . This is a large class of functions that includes all continuous functions and all Lp space formula_376 functions. The topology on formula_404 is defined in such a fashion that any locally integrable function formula_1 yields a continuous linear functional on formula_404 – that is, an element of formula_30 – denoted here by formula_408 whose value on the test function formula_409 is given by the Lebesgue integral:
formula_410

Conventionally, one abuses notation by identifying formula_411 with formula_41 provided no confusion can arise, and thus the pairing between formula_411 and formula_409 is often written
formula_415

If formula_1 and formula_146 are two locally integrable functions, then the associated distributions formula_411 and formula_419 are equal to the same element of formula_30 if and only if formula_1 and formula_146 are equal almost everywhere (see, for instance, ). Similarly, every Radon measure formula_25 on formula_29 defines an element of formula_30 whose value on the test function formula_409 is formula_427 As above, it is conventional to abuse notation and write the pairing between a Radon measure formula_25 and a test function formula_409 as formula_430 Conversely, as shown in a theorem by Schwartz (similar to the Riesz representation theorem), every distribution which is non-negative on non-negative functions is of this form for some (positive) Radon measure.

====Test functions as distributions====

The test functions are themselves locally integrable, and so define distributions. The space of test functions formula_6 is sequentially dense in formula_30 with respect to the strong topology on formula_433 This means that for any formula_434 there is a sequence of test functions, formula_435 that converges to formula_69 (in its strong dual topology) when considered as a sequence of distributions. Or equivalently,
formula_437

===Distributions with compact support===

The inclusion map formula_438 is a continuous injection whose image is dense in its codomain, so the transpose map formula_439 is also a continuous injection. Thus the image of the transpose, denoted by formula_440 forms a space of distributions.

The elements of formula_441 can be identified as the space of distributions with compact support. Explicitly, if formula_76 is a distribution on then the following are equivalent,

* formula_443
* The support of formula_76 is compact.
* The restriction of formula_76 to formula_446 when that space is equipped with the subspace topology inherited from formula_447 (a coarser topology than the canonical LF topology), is continuous.
* There is a compact subset of such that for every test function formula_409 whose support is completely outside of , we have formula_449

Compactly supported distributions define continuous linear functionals on the space formula_447; recall that the topology on formula_447 is defined such that a sequence of test functions formula_452 converges to 0 if and only if all derivatives of formula_452 converge uniformly to 0 on every compact subset of . Conversely, it can be shown that every continuous linear functional on this space defines a distribution of compact support. Thus compactly supported distributions can be identified with those distributions that can be extended from formula_6 to formula_89

===Distributions of finite order===

Let formula_456 The inclusion map formula_457 is a continuous injection whose image is dense in its codomain, so the transpose formula_458 is also a continuous injection. Consequently, the image of formula_459 denoted by formula_460 forms a space of distributions. The elements of formula_461 are &#x27; The distributions of order formula_462 which are also called &#x27; are exactly the distributions that are Radon measures (described above).

For formula_463 a is a distribution of order formula_464 that is not a distribution of order formula_465.

A distribution is said to be of if there is some integer formula_37 such that it is a distribution of order formula_467 and the set of distributions of finite order is denoted by formula_468 Note that if formula_469 then formula_470 so that formula_471 is a vector subspace of formula_30, and furthermore, if and only if formula_473

====Structure of distributions of finite order====

Every distribution with compact support in is a distribution of finite order. Indeed, every distribution in is a distribution of finite order, in the following sense: If is an open and relatively compact subset of and if formula_474 is the restriction mapping from to , then the image of formula_30 under formula_474 is contained in formula_477

The following is the theorem of the structure of distributions of finite order, which shows that every distribution of finite order can be written as a sum of derivatives of Radon measures:

Example. (Distributions of infinite order) Let formula_478 and for every test function formula_41 let formula_480

Then formula_66 is a distribution of infinite order on . Moreover, formula_66 can not be extended to a distribution on formula_483; that is, there exists no distribution formula_76 on formula_483 such that the restriction of formula_76 to is equal to formula_487

===Tempered distributions and Fourier transform ===

Defined below are the , which form a subspace of formula_488 the space of distributions on formula_35 This is a proper subspace: while every tempered distribution is a distribution and an element of formula_488 the converse is not true. Tempered distributions are useful if one studies the Fourier transform since all tempered distributions have a Fourier transform, which is not true for an arbitrary distribution in formula_491

====Schwartz space====

The Schwartz space formula_492 is the space of all smooth functions that are rapidly decreasing at infinity along with all partial derivatives. Thus formula_493 is in the Schwartz space provided that any derivative of formula_494 multiplied with any power of formula_495 converges to 0 as formula_496 These functions form a complete TVS with a suitably defined family of seminorms. More precisely, for any multi-indices formula_240 and formula_498 define
formula_499

Then formula_409 is in the Schwartz space if all the values satisfy
formula_501

The family of seminorms formula_502 defines a locally convex topology on the Schwartz space. For formula_503 the seminorms are, in fact, norms on the Schwartz space. One can also use the following family of seminorms to define the topology:
formula_504

Otherwise, one can define a norm on formula_492 via
formula_506

The Schwartz space is a Fréchet space (that is, a complete metrizable locally convex space). Because the Fourier transform changes formula_507 into multiplication by formula_508 and vice versa, this symmetry implies that the Fourier transform of a Schwartz function is also a Schwartz function.

A sequence formula_509 in formula_492 converges to 0 in formula_492 if and only if the functions formula_512 converge to 0 uniformly in the whole of formula_159 which implies that such a sequence must converge to zero in formula_514

formula_192 is dense in formula_516 The subset of all analytic Schwartz functions is dense in formula_492 as well.

The Schwartz space is nuclear, and the tensor product of two maps induces a canonical surjective TVS-isomorphisms
formula_518
where formula_519 represents the completion of the injective tensor product (which in this case is identical to the completion of the projective tensor product).

====Tempered distributions====

The inclusion map formula_520 is a continuous injection whose image is dense in its codomain, so the transpose formula_521 is also a continuous injection. Thus, the image of the transpose map, denoted by formula_522 forms a space of distributions.

The space formula_523 is called the space of . It is the continuous dual space of the Schwartz space. Equivalently, a distribution formula_76 is a tempered distribution if and only if
formula_525

The derivative of a tempered distribution is again a tempered distribution. Tempered distributions generalize the bounded (or slow-growing) locally integrable functions; all distributions with compact support and all square-integrable functions are tempered distributions. More generally, all functions that are products of polynomials with elements of Lp space formula_526 for formula_527 are tempered distributions.

The can also be characterized as , meaning that each derivative of formula_76 grows at most as fast as some polynomial. This characterization is dual to the behaviour of the derivatives of a function in the Schwartz space, where each derivative of formula_409 decays faster than every inverse power of formula_530 An example of a rapidly falling function is formula_531 for any positive formula_532

====Fourier transform====

To study the Fourier transform, it is best to consider complex-valued test functions and complex-linear distributions. The ordinary continuous Fourier transform formula_533 is a TVS-automorphism of the Schwartz space, and the is defined to be its transpose formula_534 which (abusing notation) will again be denoted by formula_535 So the Fourier transform of the tempered distribution formula_76 is defined by formula_537 for every Schwartz function formula_538 formula_539 is thus again a tempered distribution. The Fourier transform is a TVS isomorphism from the space of tempered distributions onto itself. This operation is compatible with differentiation in the sense that
formula_540
and also with convolution: if formula_76 is a tempered distribution and formula_22 is a smooth function on formula_159 formula_544 is again a tempered distribution and
formula_545
is the convolution of formula_539 and formula_547 In particular, the Fourier transform of the constant function equal to 1 is the formula_90 distribution.

====Expressing tempered distributions as sums of derivatives====

If formula_549 is a tempered distribution, then there exists a constant formula_550 and positive integers formula_229 and formula_552 such that for all Schwartz functions formula_553
formula_554

This estimate, along with some techniques from functional analysis, can be used to show that there is a continuous slowly increasing function formula_123 and a multi-index formula_240 such that
formula_557

====Restriction of distributions to compact sets====

If formula_558 then for any compact set formula_559 there exists a continuous function formula_123compactly supported in formula_121 (possibly on a larger set than itself) and a multi-index formula_240 such that formula_563 on formula_564

==Using holomorphic functions as test functions==

The success of the theory led to an investigation of the idea of hyperfunction, in which spaces of holomorphic functions are used as test functions. A refined theory has been developed, in particular Mikio Sato&#x27;s algebraic analysis, using sheaf theory and several complex variables. This extends the range of symbolic methods that can be made into rigorous mathematics, for example, Feynman integrals.

<text>Mornington Crescent is an improvisational comedy game featured in the BBC Radio 4 comedy panel show &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot; (ISIHAC), a series that satirises panel games.

The game consists of each panellist in turn announcing a landmark or street, most often a tube station on the London Underground system. The ostensible aim is to be the first to announce &quot;Mornington Crescent&quot;, a station on the Northern line. Interspersed with the turns is humorous discussion amongst the panellists and host regarding the rules and legality of each move, as well as the strategy the panellists are using. The actual aim of the game is to entertain the other participants and listeners with amusing discussion of the fictional rules and strategies.

== Origins ==
Mornington Crescent first appeared in the opening episode of the sixth series of BBC Radio 4&#x27;s comedy panel show &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot;, broadcast on 22 August 1978. Although five episodes transmitted in 1974–1975 are lost, Mornington Crescent seems to have made no appearance before 1978. It was played in every surviving episode of the sixth series. It has been played ever since.

The origins of the game are not clear. One claim is that it was invented by Geoffrey Perkins, who stated in an interview that Mornington Crescent was created as a non-game. Barry Cryer, a panellist on the programme from 1972 until shortly before his death in 2022, said that Geoffrey Perkins did not invent the game, and that it had been around since the 1960s. According to Chairman Humphrey Lyttelton, the game was invented to vex a series producer who was unpopular with the panellists. One day, the team members were drinking, when they heard him coming. &quot;Quick,&quot; said one, &quot;let&#x27;s invent a game with rules he&#x27;ll never understand.&quot;

A similar game called &quot;Finchley Central&quot; was described in the Spring 1969 issue of the mathematical magazine &quot;Manifold&quot;, edited by Ian Stewart and John Jaworski at the University of Warwick. Douglas Hofstadter referred to the article in his 1985 book &quot;Metamagical Themas&quot;. The game is referred to as an &quot;English game&quot; in an article on &quot;non-games&quot; as follows:

Two players alternate naming the stations of the London Underground. The first to say &quot;Finchley Central&quot; wins. It is clear that the &quot;best&quot; time to say &quot;Finchley Central&quot; is exactly before your opponent does. Failing that, it is good that he should be considering it. You could, of course, say &quot;Finchley Central&quot; on your second turn. In that case, your opponent puffs on his cigarette and says, &quot;Well... Shame on you.&quot;
==Gameplay on &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot;==
The objective of Mornington Crescent is to give the appearance of a game of skill and strategy, with complex and long-winded rules and strategies, to parody games in which similarly circuitous systems have evolved. The apparent rules are fictional, and its appeal to audiences lies in the ability of players to create an entertaining illusion of competitive gameplay.

Humorous variations to the rules have been introduced to games. Humphrey Lyttelton would describe special rules to apply to that session, such as &quot;Trumpington&#x27;s Variations&quot; or &quot;Tudor Court Rules&quot;, so that almost every episode featuring Mornington Crescent introduced a variant. In one of them, first introduced in North Yorkshire, a player whose movement is blocked is considered to be &quot;in Nidd&quot; and is forced to remain in place for the next three moves. This tends to block the other players, putting them into Nidd as well and causing a roadblock. In one episode, every player ended up in Nidd and the rule had to be suspended so that the round could continue.

Over time, the destinations named by the panellists expanded beyond the Underground, in accordance with various regional expansions of the game. &quot;ISIHAC&quot; is recorded around the United Kingdom, and the game is occasionally modified accordingly. There have been versions in Slough and Leeds, as well as one in Scotland, played during the Edinburgh Fringe arts festival and a 2016 recording in Glasgow (where the name was changed to &quot;Morningside Crescent&quot;) and another variation played at recordings in Wales (called &quot;Morganstown Crescent&quot;). In one episode, recorded in Luton, panellists named locations as far afield as the Place de l&#x27;Étoile in Paris, Nevsky Prospekt in St. Petersburg, and Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, DC, but a move to Luton High Street was ruled invalid for being too remote. In other episodes, an attempt was supposedly made to expand the territory to Manhattan (via Heathrow and JFK) but there was some disagreement as to whether or not the New York City Subway system was suited to the game. References have been made in various episodes of &quot;ISIHAC&quot; to international versions of the game, including &quot;Mornington Croissant&quot;, supposedly based on the Paris Métro, and &quot;Mornington Peninsula&quot;, the Australian variant. At least one full game of Mornington Croissant was played on air.

A regular feature that introduces Mornington Crescent is a letters section which begins with the chairman&#x27;s comments (&quot;I notice from the sheer weight of this week&#x27;s postbag, we&#x27;ve received a little over no letters&quot; and &quot;I see from the number of letters raining down on us this week that the Scrabble factory has exploded again&quot;). The selected letter each week is invariably from &quot;A Mrs. Trellis of North Wales&quot;, whose incoherent letters usually mistake the chairman for another Radio 4 presenter or media personality. &quot;Dear Libby,&quot; (she writes), &quot;why oh why ... very nearly spells YOYO&quot;, or &quot;Dear Mr. Titchmarsh, never let them tell you that size isn&#x27;t important. My aunt told me that, but then all my new wallpaper fell off.&quot;

== Further popularity ==

Finchley Central and Mornington Crescent have been played as a play-by-mail pastime, and in the 1980s were played by post in a number of play-by-mail magazines. One format involved a series of elimination rounds, with everyone except the winner of the current round going forward onto the next. A &quot;type-in&quot; computer version of the game for the BBC Micro was included in the April 1985 edition of &quot;The Micro User&quot;. Mornington Crescent can now be played online, in the spirit of the radio series. Games are played by fans on Usenet, in diverse web forums, and on the London Underground itself. A Facebook application has also been produced.

When Mornington Crescent Underground station was reopened in 1998 after six years of closure for lift repairs, London Transport invited the &quot;Clue&quot; team to perform an opening ceremony. A memorial plaque to the late Willie Rushton, one of the show&#x27;s longest-serving panelists, was installed at the station in 2002.

== Spin-offs and publications ==
At Christmas 1984, Radio 4 broadcast a special programme, &quot;Everyman&#x27;s Guide to Mornington Crescent&quot;, a &quot;two-part documentary&quot; on the history of the game and its rules, presented by Raymond Baxter. At the end of part one (concentrating on the history), it was announced that part two (about the rules) had been postponed due to &quot;scheduling difficulties&quot;.

Another documentary was broadcast on Christmas Eve 2005. It was named &quot;In Search of Mornington Crescent&quot;, and narrated by Andrew Marr. This has since also been released on a BBC Audiobook CD.

Two books of rules and history have been published, &quot;The Little Book of Mornington Crescent&quot; (2001; ), by Graeme Garden, Tim Brooke-Taylor, Barry Cryer and Humphrey Lyttelton, and &quot;Stovold&#x27;s Mornington Crescent Almanac&quot; (2001; ), by Graeme Garden.

== Cultural references ==

The code for the first ever Mornington Crescent computer game, on a BBC Micro, was presented on p154 of the April 1985 edition of &quot;The Micro User&quot;, an early computer magazine. Due to space restrictions, the rules for the game were not published but were promised for the next month&#x27;s edition, along with an explanation by a member of the Society for the Support of Mornington Crescent, Dr. Richard Taylor-Fischel. Unfortunately, in that edition on the Letters page, p121, he took umbrage at the modifications to the game that had been necessary to produce a computer program and consequently withdrew his collaboration, using the name Dr. R. T. Fischel PhD and bar.
