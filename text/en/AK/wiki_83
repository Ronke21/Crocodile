==History==
===Founding and formation===
When part of the New Netherland colony, Dutch traders first called the area of present-day Ulster County &quot;Esopus&quot;, a name borrowed for convenience from a locality on the opposite side of the Hudson. &quot;Esopus&quot; meant &quot;land of flowing water and high banks,&quot; or &quot;small brook.&quot; There is also a town named Esopus located within Ulster County.

The local Lenape indigenous people called themselves Waranawanka, but soon came to be known to the Dutch as the &quot;Esopus Indians&quot; because they were encountered around the settlement known as Esopus. In 1652, Thomas Chambers, a freeholder from the Manor of Rensselaerswyck, purchased land at Esopus. He and several others actually settled and began farming by June 1653. The settlements grew into the village of Wiltwijck, which the English later named Kingston. In 1683, the Duke of York created 12 counties in his province, one of which was Ulster County, named after Prince James, Duke of York (later King James II of England) whose subsidiary titles included Earl of Ulster. Its boundaries at that time included the present Sullivan County and parts of the present Delaware, Orange, and Greene counties.

In 1777, the first state capital of the independent New York State was established at Kingston. The official records of Ulster County were removed to safety to a stone house in Kerhonkson when it became evident that the British would burn Kingston.

In 1797, parts of Otsego and Ulster counties were split off to create Delaware County.

In 1798, Ulster County&#x27;s southernmost towns were moved into Orange County to compensate Orange for breaking away its southernmost part to form Rockland County.

In 1800, portions of Albany and Ulster counties were split off to create Greene County.

In 1809, Sullivan County was split off from Ulster County.

===Civil War===
During the American Civil War, volunteers were recruited from the county and formed the majority of the following regiments:

==Government and politics==












|}

For most of the 20th century, Ulster County voted for the Republican nominees for president. Republicans regularly got over 60% of the vote, the high point coming when Dwight D. Eisenhower won 76% in 1956. The Democratic nominee won only in 1912, when Theodore Roosevelt and his Progressive Party split the Republican vote and gave a plurality to Woodrow Wilson, and in 1964, when Lyndon B. Johnson won every county in New York and carried Ulster County by 19.8 percentage points.

More recently, Ulster County has voted Democratic. In 1992, 1996, and 2000, the party won a plurality, due to strong showings from third parties. In 2004, John Kerry defeated George W. Bush, 54%–43%; in 2008, Barack Obama defeated John McCain, 61%–37%; in 2012, Obama defeated Mitt Romney, 60%–37%; in 2016, Hillary Clinton defeated Donald Trump, 52%–41%; in 2020, Joe Biden defeated Trump, 60%–39%; and in 2024, Kamala Harris defeated Trump, 58%–40%.

As of 2025, Ulster County is divided between 2 United States House of Representatives districts. The more populated eastern half of the county is in New York&#x27;s 18th congressional district, represented by Democrat Pat Ryan. The less populated western half of the county is in New York&#x27;s 19th congressional district, represented by Democrat Josh Riley. Ulster County had no U.S. representative after Antonio Delgado resigned on May 25, 2022, to become lieutenant governor of New York. Ryan won a special election on August 23 against Marc Molinaro, and was sworn in on September 13. Ryan ran in the 18th congressional district in the 2022 general election after redistricting put most of Ulster County in that district. Ryan was narrowly reelected against New York Assembly member Colin Schmitt. Molinaro ran in the 19th district and narrowly defeated Riley, before narrowly losing to Riley in a rematch in 2024.

===County government===
For a long time, Ulster County had a county-scale version of a council-manager government, with the county legislature hiring a county administrator to handle executive functions. The chair of the legislature had a great deal of power and was accountable only to the voters of their district. The only countywide elected officials were the county clerk, district attorney, and sheriff.

In 2006, voters approved the first-ever county charter, changing to an elected executive branch. Two years later, Michael P. Hein, the last appointed county administrator, became Ulster&#x27;s first elected county executive. In early 2019, Hein resigned to accept Governor Andrew Cuomo&#x27;s appointment as commissioner of the state Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance. Deputy County Executive Adele Reiter succeeded him as acting county executive until a special election was held in April 2019.

On April 30, 2019, Democrat Patrick K. Ryan was elected in a special election by a margin of 74%-26%. He was sworn in as Ulster County&#x27;s second County Executive on June 7, 2019. On September 9, 2022, Ryan stepped down as county executive after winning election to the United States House of Representatives, and Johanna Contreras was sworn in as an acting county executive.

Democrat Jen Metzger, a former New York State Senator, defeated Republican Jim Quigley in the 2022 election to replace Ryan. For the election, 14-year-old Hudson Rowan designed the Ulster County &quot;I Voted&quot; sticker, which went viral for its weird design. Metzger took office in 2023.

Legislative authority is vested in the County Legislature, which consists of 23 members elected from individual districts, as directed by a county charter reapportionment mandate starting in late 2010. Of the members of the 2024-2025 County Legislature, 14 are part of the Democratic Caucus (all 14 are affiliated with the Democratic Party), and 9 are part of the Republican Caucus (all 9 are affiliated with the Republican Party).

<text>Wyoming County is a county in the U.S. state of New York in the state&#x27;s western area. As of the 2020 census, the population was 40,531. The county seat is Warsaw. The name is modified from a Lenape (Delaware) Native American word meaning &quot;broad bottom lands&quot;. Wyoming County was formed from Genesee County in 1841. Wyoming County is one of New York&#x27;s mostly agricultural counties. With an estimated 47,500 dairy cows in the county, there are more cattle in Wyoming County than people. The county is part of the Finger Lakes region of the state.

==History==

As with the rest of Western New York, Wyoming County was part of disputed territory throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, claimed by the Massachusetts Bay Colony, Connecticut Colony, Pennsylvania Colony, New York Colony, and New France. New York&#x27;s claims were not recognized until the Treaty of Hartford was ratified in 1786 and were not actively asserted until the Holland Purchase.

In regard to New York&#x27;s claim, as of 1683 the present Wyoming County was part of Albany County of the Province of New York. This was an enormous county, including the northern part of New York State as well as all of the present State of Vermont and, in theory, extending westward to the Pacific Ocean. This county was reduced in size on July 3, 1766, by the creation of Cumberland County, and further on March 16, 1770, by the creation of Gloucester County, both containing territory now in the state of Vermont.

On March 12, 1772, what was left of Albany County was split into three parts, one remaining under the name Albany County. One of the other pieces, Tryon County, contained the western portion (and thus, since no western boundary was specified, theoretically still extended west to the Pacific). The eastern boundary of Tryon County was approximately five miles west of the present city of Schenectady, and the county included the western part of the Adirondack Mountains and the area west of the West Branch of the Delaware River. The area then designated as Tryon County now includes 37 counties of New York State.

In the years prior to 1776, most of the Loyalists in Tryon County fled to Canada. In 1784, following the peace treaty that ended the American Revolutionary War, the name of Tryon County was changed to Montgomery County in order to honor the general, Richard Montgomery, who had captured several places in Canada and died attempting to capture the city of Quebec, replacing the name of the hated British governor.

In 1789, Ontario County was split off from Montgomery as part of the establishment of the Morris Reserve.

Almost all of the land west of the Genesee River, including all of present-day Wyoming County, was part of the &quot;Holland Land Purchase&quot; in 1793. It was sold privately to settlers through the Holland Land Company&#x27;s office in Batavia, starting in 1801.

Genesee County was created by a splitting of Ontario County in 1802 to govern the land acquired in the Holland Purchase. This territory was much larger than the present Genesee County. It was reduced in size in 1806 by creating Allegany County; again in 1808 by creating Cattaraugus, Chautauqua, and Niagara counties. Niagara County at that time also included the present Erie County.

In 1821, portions of Genesee County were combined with portions of Ontario County to create Livingston and Monroe counties.

Genesee County was further reduced in size in 1824 by creating Orleans County.

Finally, in 1841, Wyoming County was created from the southern half of Genesee County, the northwest corner of Allegany County, and a small portion of the northeast corner of Cattaraugus County.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.6%) is water.

Wyoming County is in the western part of New York State, east of Buffalo and slightly west of due south of Rochester. The county is in the Holland Purchase Region.

The county is largely rural, dotted with small towns. Even the county seat, Warsaw is quite small. The land surface is generally broken and hilly, and the soil fertile. Much of the area is wooded, used for timber. Some that are predominantly maple are tapped each spring for the production of maple syrup. Agriculture dominates the county economy. Apple orchards were once a major agricultural endeavor, but only a few are left. The area is also well known for outdoor sports, being an excellent area for fishing, hunting, and snowmobiling.

An active geologic fault runs down the Dale valley through Linden, to the east of Batavia and into Lake Ontario. Movement of the fault is an occasional source of minor earthquakes, which, at most, have toppled a couple chimneys. The Dale Valley has been developed as a source of salt by way of brine wells, for the chemical industry. A pipeline moves the brine to Niagara Falls.

The county is bounded on the southeast by the Genesee River, and drained by tributaries of that stream, as well as Tonawanda, Buffalo, and other creeks. An important tributary of the Genesee River, Oatka Creek, has its source in the Town of Gainesville within the county.

===Politics===












|}

Wyoming County is extremely conservative. In state and national politics, Wyoming County is one of the most Republican counties in New York, a state that characteristically votes Democratic. In both the 2004 and 2008 U.S. presidential elections, it was the second-reddest county in New York, behind Hamilton County. In fact, the only Democrat to carry the county since the Civil War has been Lyndon Baines Johnson in 1964, during an election when no county in the Empire State supported Republican Barry Goldwater. In 2004, George W. Bush carried Wyoming County by a 30.9 percent margin over John Kerry, with Kerry carrying the state by an 18.3 percent margin. However, Senator Chuck Schumer concurrently won the county very narrowly; this was the last time that Wyoming County voted Democratic in a statewide federal election. In 2008, John McCain won the county by a 26.1 percent margin over Barack Obama, with Obama defeating McCain statewide by 26.7 percent. In New York&#x27;s 2006 U.S. Senatorial election, Wyoming County voted for John Spencer by a 4% margin over Hillary Clinton, with Clinton being re-elected by a 36% margin over Spencer. In 2010, Wyoming County was one of only three counties to favor Republican Jay Townsend over Schumer. In the Senate Special election that same year, the county favored Republican Joe DioGuardi over the Democratic incumbent, Kirsten Gillibrand. In 2012, Wyoming County again selected a Republican for this seat, being one of only two counties (the other being neighboring Allegany County) to vote in favor of Republican candidate Wendy Long rather than Gillibrand. In 2016, Wyoming County once again favored Long as she lost statewide to Schumer. In 2018, the county once again rejected Gillibrand by favoring Republican Chele Farley.

In 2017 Jon Campbell of the &quot;Democrat &amp; Chronicle&quot; wrote that the county &quot;is solid Trump Country.&quot;

==Points of interest==
* Letchworth State Park, on the Genesee River forms part of the southeastern boundary of the county. A deep gorge with three major waterfalls characterize this scenic and historic area, created when a glacier during the last Ice age diverted the river and forced it to cut a new valley. It is the home area of Mary Jemison, the &quot;White Woman of the Genesee&quot;, who was captured as a young person by the Seneca tribe and became an important figure in negotiations between the tribe and the land companies.
* Middlebury Academy, in Wyoming village, the first high school level school west of the Genesee. The Greek revival building still exists and is on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Yates County is a county in the U.S. state of New York. As of the 2020 Census, the population was 24,774, making it the third-least populous county in New York. The county seat is Penn Yan. The name is in honor of Joseph C. Yates, who as Governor of New York signed the act establishing the county. The county is part of the Finger Lakes region of the state.

Yates County is included in the Rochester, NY Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
When counties were established in New York State in 1683, the present Yates County was part of Albany County. This was an enormous county, including the northern part of New York State as well as all of the present State of Vermont and, in theory, extending westward to the Pacific Ocean. This county was reduced in size on July 3, 1766, by the creation of Cumberland County, and again on March 16, 1770, by the creation of Gloucester County, both containing territory now in Vermont.

On March 12, 1772, what was left of Albany County was split into three parts, one remaining under the name Albany County. One of the other pieces, Tryon County, contained the western portion (and thus, since no western boundary was specified, theoretically still extended west to the Pacific). The eastern boundary of Tryon County was approximately five miles west of the present city of Schenectady, and the county included the western part of the Adirondack Mountains and the area west of the West Branch of the Delaware River. The area then designated as Tryon County now includes 37 counties of New York State. The county was named for William Tryon, colonial governor of New York.

In the years prior to 1776, most of the Loyalists in Tryon County fled to Canada. In 1784, following the peace treaty that ended the American Revolutionary War, the name of Tryon County was changed to honor the general, Richard Montgomery, who had captured several places in Canada and died attempting to capture the city of Quebec, replacing the name of the hated British governor.

On January 27, 1789, of Montgomery County was split off to create Ontario County, including the lands of the present Allegany, Cattaraugus, Chautauqua, Erie, Genesee, Livingston, Monroe, Niagara, Orleans, Steuben, Wyoming, and Yates counties, and part of Schuyler and Wayne counties.

On March 18, 1796, of Ontario County was partitioned to form Steuben County.

On April 3, 1801, Ontario County exchanged land with Cayuga County, and lost as a result.

On March 30, 1802, Ontario County lost of land through the partition of Genesee County, including the present Allegany, Cattaraugus, Chautauqua, Erie, Niagara, Orleans and Wyoming counties and parts of Livingston and Monroe counties.

In 1821, Ontario County was reduced in size by combining portions of Genesee and Ontario counties to create Livingston and Monroe counties.

On February 5, 1823, Yates County was formed from of Ontario County, including the area that included Vine Valley, Middlesex, Penn Yan, and Dresden, New York.

On January 1, 1826, of Steuben County was partitioned and added to Yates, which included Starkey, Dundee, and Lakemont, New York.
On April 15, 1828, was partitioned from Yates, and passed to Seneca and Tompkins counties, mostly in the forest.

On March 17, 1860, Ontario County was authorized to gain land from Yates, but it was never put into effect.

On April 18, 1946, Yates gained from Schuyler and Seneca counties, which produced the current borders of Yates County.

In 1974 a new Mennonite settlement was started in Yates County. It grew quickly and steadily and with a population of more than 3,000 in 2015 it was almost as large as the Lancaster County, Pennsylvania settlement.

<doc id="56959" wikidata="Q429135" url="?curid=56959" title="Geography of Portugal">
<text>Portugal is a coastal nation in western Europe, located at the western end of the Iberian Peninsula, bordering Spain (on its northern and eastern frontiers: a total of ). The Portuguese territory also includes a series of archipelagos in the Atlantic Ocean (the Azores and Madeira), which are strategic islands along the North Atlantic. The extreme south is not too far from the Strait of Gibraltar, leading to the Mediterranean Sea. In total, the country occupies an area of of which is land and water.

Despite these definitions, the Portugal-Spain border remains an unresolved territorial dispute between the two countries. Portugal does not recognise the border between Caia and Ribeira de Cuncos River deltas, since the beginning of the 1801 occupation of Olivenza by Spain. This territory, though under &quot;de facto&quot; Spanish occupation, remains a &quot;de jure&quot; part of Portugal, consequently no border is henceforth recognised in this area.

==Physical==

Portugal is located on the western coast of the Iberian Peninsula and plateau, that divides the inland Mediterranean Sea from the Atlantic Ocean. It is located on the Atlantic coast of this plateau and crossed by several rivers which have their origin in Spain. Most of these rivers flow from east to west disgorging in the Atlantic; from north to south, the primary rivers are the Minho, Douro, Mondego, Tagus and the Guadiana.

===Coastline===
The Portuguese continental shelf has an area of , although its width is variable from in the north to in the south. Its strong relief is marked by deep submarine canyons and the continuation of the main rivers. The Estremadura Spur separates the Iberian Abyssal and Tagus Abyssal Plains, while the continental slope is flanked by sea-mounts and abuts against the prominent Gorringe Bank in the south. Currently, the Portuguese government claims jurisdiction to a sea depth of , or to the depth of exploitation.

The Portuguese coast is extensive; in addition to approximately along the coast of continental Portugal, the archipelagos of the Azores (667 km) and Madeira (250 km) are primarily surrounded by rough cliff coastlines. Most of these landscapes alternate between rough cliffs and fine sand beaches; the region of the Algarve is recognized for its sandy beaches popular with tourists, while at the same time its coastline around Cape St. Vincent is well known for steep and forbidding cliffs. An interesting feature of the Portuguese coast is the Ria Formosa with some sandy islands and a mild and pleasant climate characterized by warm, but not very hot, summers and generally mild winters.

In contrast, the Ria de Aveiro coast (near Aveiro, referred to as &quot;The Portuguese Venice&quot;) is formed by a delta approximately long with a maximum width of , rich in fish and seabirds. Four main channels flow through several islands and islets at the mouth of the Vouga, Antuã, Boco, and Fontão Rivers. Since the 16th century, this formation of narrow headlands formed a lagoon, which allowed the formation and production of salt. It was also recognized by the Romans, whose forces exported its salt—then a precious resource—to Rome.

The Azores are sprinkled with both black-sand and boulder-lined beaches; only as a rare exception are there white-sand beaches (such as on the island of Santa Maria in Almagreira). The island of Porto Santo has one of the few extensive dune beaches in Portugal, located in the archipelago of Madeira.

Tidal gauges along the Portuguese coast have identified a rise in sea levels, causing large estuaries and inland deltas in some major rivers to overflow.

As a result of its maritime possessions and long coastline, Portugal has an Exclusive Economic Zone of . This is the third largest EEZ of all countries in the European Union and the 20th in the world. This sea-zone, over which Portugal exercises special territorial rights over the economic exploration and use of marine resources, encircles an area of (divided as: Continental Portugal 327,667 km2, Azores Islands 953,633 km2, Madeira Islands 446,108 km2).

===Continent===

The Portuguese territory came into existence during the history of Gondwana and became aligned with European landforms after the super-continent Pangea began its slow separation into several smaller plates. The Iberian plate was formed during the Cadomian Orogeny of the late Neoproterozoic (about 650-550 Ma), from the margins of the Gondwana continent. Through collisions and accretion a group of island arcs (that included the Central Iberian Plate, Ossa-Morena Plate, South Portuguese Plate) began to disintegrate from Gondwana (along with other European fragments). These plates never separated substantially from each other since this period. By the Mesozoic, the three &quot;Portuguese plates&quot; were a part of the Northern France Armoric Plate until the Bay of Biscay began to separate. Following the separation of the Iberian Abyssal Plain, Iberia and Europe began to drift progressively from North America, as the Mid-Atlantic fracture zone pulled the three plates away from the larger continent. Eventually, Iberia collided with southern France attaching the region into a peninsula of Europe (during the Cenozoic). Since the late Oligocene, the Iberian plate has been moving as part of the Eurasian plate, with the boundary between Eurasia and Africa situated along the Azores–Gibraltar fracture zone.

The Iberian peninsula, defined by its coastline, is due to a fragment of the Variscan tectonic fracture zone, the Iberian-Hesperian Massif, which occupies the west-central part of the plateau. This formation is crossed by the Central System, along an east-northeast to west-southwest alignment, parallel to the European Baetic Chain (an aspect of the Alpine Chain). The Central Cordillera is itself divided into two blocks, while three main river systems drain the differing geomorphological terrains: 
* the Northern Meseta (with a mean altitude of ) is drained by the Douro River (running east to west);
* the Southern Meseta (within a range of altitude) is drained by the Tagus River (running east to west) from Spain, and the Guadiana River (running north to south), comprising the Lower Tagus and Sado Basins.

To the north the landscape is mountainous in the interior areas with plateaus, cut by four breakings lines that allow the development of more fertile agricultural areas.

The south down as far as the Algarve features mostly rolling plains with a climate somewhat warmer and drier than the cooler and rainier north. Other major rivers include the Douro, the Minho and the Guadiana, similar to the Tagus in that all originate in Spain. Another important river, the Mondego, originates in the Serra da Estrela (the highest mountains in mainland Portugal at 1,993 m). A full list of rivers is available in List of rivers of Portugal.

No large natural lakes exist in Continental Portugal, and the largest inland water surfaces are dam-originated reservoirs, such as the Alqueva Reservoir with , the largest in Europe. However, there are several small freshwater lakes in Portugal, the most notable of which are located in Serra da Estrela, Lake Comprida (&quot;Lagoa Comprida&quot;) and Lake Escura (&quot;Lagoa Escura&quot;), which were formed from ancient glaciers. Pateira de Fermentelos is a small natural lake near Aveiro, it is one of the largest natural lakes in the Iberian Peninsula and is rich in wildlife. In the Azores archipelago lakes were formed in the caldera of extinct volcanoes. Lagoa do Fogo and Lagoa das Sete Cidades (two small lakes connected by a narrow way) are the most famous lakes in São Miguel Island.

Lagoons in the shores of the Atlantic exist. For instance, the Albufeira Lagoon and Óbidos Lagoon (near Foz do Arelho, Óbidos).

===Archipelagos===

In addition to continental Europe, Portugal consists of two Autonomous Regions in the Atlantic Ocean, consisting of the archipelagos of Madeira and Azores. Madeira is located on the African Tectonic Plate, and comprises the main island of Madeira, Porto Santo and the smaller Savage Islands. The Azores, which are located between the junction of the African, European and North American Plates, straddle the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. There are nine islands in this archipelago, usually divided into three groups (Western, Central and Eastern) and several smaller Formigas (rock outcroppings) located between São Miguel and Santa Maria Islands. Both island groups are volcanic in nature, with historic volcanology and seismic activity persisting to the present time. In addition, there are several submarine volcanos in the Azores (such as Dom João de Castro Bank), that have erupted historically (such as the Serrata eruption off the coast of Terceira Island). The last major volcanic event occurred in 1957-58 along the western coast of Faial Island, which formed the Capelinhos Volcano. Seismic events are common in the Azores.
The Azores are occasionally subject to very strong earthquakes, as is the continental coast. Wildfires occur mostly in the summer in mainland Portugal and extreme weather in the form of strong winds and floods also occurs mainly in winter. The Azores are occasionally stricken by tropical cyclones such as Hurricane Jeanne (1998) and Hurricane Gordon (2006).

==Climate ==


Most of Portugal has a Mediterranean climate according to the Köppen climate classification: &quot;&quot;Csa&quot; (or hot-summer Mediterranean climate) in most of the lands south of the Tagus River, inland Douro Valley in the Norte Region, eastern Azores and the Madeira archipelago. The &quot;Csb&quot; warm-summer Mediterranean pattern can be found north of that same river and in Costa Vicentina in coastal Southern Portugal. Most of the Azores have a humid subtropical climate or &quot;Cfa&quot;, while a small region in inland Alentejo has &quot;BSk&quot; or semi-arid climate. The Savage Islands are the only region to have an arid climate or &quot;BWh&quot;&quot;. The sea surface temperatures in these islands vary from in winter to in the summer, occasionally reaching .

The annual average temperature in mainland Portugal varies from in the mountainous interior north to in the south (in general the south is warmer and drier than the north). The Madeira and Azores archipelagos have a narrower temperature range. Extreme temperatures occur in the mountains in the interior North and Centre of the country in winter, where they may fall below or in rare occasions below , particularly in the higher peaks of Serra da Estrela, and in southeastern parts in the summer, sometimes exceeding . The official absolute extreme temperatures are in Penhas da Saúde on 4 February 1954 and Miranda do Douro, and in Amareleja in the Alentejo region, on 1 August 2003. There are, however, unofficial records of on 4 August 1881 in Riodades, São João da Pesqueira and on 6 July 1949 in Figueira da Foz in an apparent heat burst (see the Highest temperature recorded on Earth). Such temperatures are not validated since these were measured in enclosures that were much more susceptible to solar radiation and/or in enclosed gardens which tend to heat up a lot more than in the open where temperatures should be measured. There are also records of from a Polytechnic Institute in Bragança, and below in Serra da Estrela, which have no official value since they were not recorded by IPMA. Such values are however perpetuated by weather enthusiasts who are fond of extremes. The annual average rainfall in continental Portugal varies from around in a few mountain tops in the north at Peneda-Gerês National Park to around in inland parts of Alentejo. In Macaronesia however, Pico Island holds the record with upwards of in the higher altitudes and the Savage Islands around . Portugal as a whole is amongst the sunniest areas in Europe, with around 2300–3200 hours of sunshine a year, an average of 4-6h in winter and 10-12h in the summer. The sea surface temperature is higher in the south coast where it varies from in January to in August, occasionally reaching ; on the west coast the sea surface temperature is around in winter and in the summer.

<doc id="56960" wikidata="Q1981371" url="?curid=56960" title="Demographics of Portugal">
<text>Demographic features of the population of Portugal include population density, ethnicity, education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.

As of 2023, Portugal had an estimated population of 10,639,726 inhabitants. Its population density, at , is slightly higher than that of most EU countries, moderately surpassing the EU average of . However, the distribution of the population is widely uneven; the most densely populated areas are the Lisbon metropolitan area (which contains well above a quarter of the country&#x27;s population), the metropolitan areas of Porto and the Atlantic coast, while other vast areas are very sparsely populated, like the plateaus of Alentejo, the Trás-os-Montes and Serra da Estrela highlands, and the lesser islands of the Azores archipelago.

The population of the country almost doubled during the twentieth century (+91%), but the pattern of growth was extremely uneven due to large-scale internal migration from the rural North to the industrial cities of Lisbon and Porto, a phenomenon which happened as a consequence of the robust economic growth and structural modernisation, owing to a liberalisation of the economy of the 1960s. 

High fertility and birth rates persisted until the 1980s, after which they started to dramatically decline, leading to rapid population aging. At the end of the first decade of the 21st century, almost one in five Portuguese was over 65 years old. Lately, Portugal has been experiencing a short growth in birth rates. The total fertility rate has climbed from an all-time low of 1.21 children per woman in 2013 to 1.43 in 2022, still well below replacement level.

Due to decrease in emigration and increase in immigration in the late 1990s and early 2000s the total population reached its peak in December 2009, standing at 10,573,479. Since then, due to the 2008 financial crisis, immigration (that was- in some years - surpassed by emigration) could not offset a shrinking population size, mainly due to the low birthrate but, also due to aging, the rising mortality. After having decreased by 2.27% by 2018, the total population of Portugal started to grow again, mainly sustained by growing immigration and slightly increasing birth rates. By 2023, the total population had already surpassed the 2009 peak.

Portugal is a fairly linguistically and religiously homogeneous country. Ethnically, the Portuguese people form a big majority of the total population in Portugal. The Portuguese people are mainly a combination of ancient paleolithic populations, and the proto-Celtic, Celtic, and the para-Celtic Lusitanians. Some other groups, like the Romans, Germanic (Visigoths, Suevi, Buri, Alans and Vandals) and later the Moorish (Arabs and Berber), Sephardic Jewish, and the French also passed through the country.

Today, Brazilians, Britons, Indians, Italians, French, Ukrainians, Nepalis and countries members of PALOP (Portuguese-speaking African countries) are the main immigrants and form the major foreign communities in the country. 

Portuguese is spoken throughout the country, with only some villages near the northern municipality of Miranda do Douro speaking Mirandese, locally recognised as a co-official language.

==Total fertility rate from 1850 to 1899==
The total fertility rate is the number of children born per woman. It is based on fairly good data for the entire period. Sources: Our World In Data and Gapminder Foundation.

==Urban organization==

===Metropolitan areas and agglomerations===

As of 2023, Portugal had two significant agglomerations: the political metropolitan areas of Lisbon and Porto – &quot;Grande Área Metropolitana de Lisboa&quot; (3.0 million) and &quot;Grande Área Metropolitana do Porto&quot; (1.8 million). Together they host 44.77% of the total population.

===Largest urban areas===

When considering the number of inhabitants in consistent single urban areas, de facto cities in mainland Portugal, per the new with increased density of human-created structures, and excluding suburban and rural areas, Portugal has two cities with about one million inhabitants each (Lisbon and Porto), ten others with more than 50,000 inhabitants and 14 cities with populations between 20,000 and 40,000 inhabitants.

Portugal has 151 localities with national city status (&quot;cidade&quot;). Every city is included into a municipality (&quot;município&quot;). This is a list of population by city, which means that it refers to the number of inhabitants in the city proper, excluding inhabitants from the same municipality but living outside the urban area of the city in other civil parishes (&quot;freguesias&quot;) of the municipality. In some cases (e.g. Lisbon), the entire municipality and the city proper cover the same territory.

===Largest municipalities by population===
The following table lists the largest Portuguese municipalities by population as of 2023. The land area is expressed in km2 and only municipalities with populations of over 100,000 inhabitants are listed. The 26 listed municipalities account for 46.10% of the country&#x27;s population and for only 5.14% of its total land area.

===Nationality===
:&quot;noun:&quot; Portuguese (singular and plural)
:&quot;adjective:&quot; Portuguese

===Immigration===
In 1992, 1.3% of the population was foreign, by 2023 the number had grown to almost 10% or 1,044,606 people.

Since the independence of the former African colonies, Portugal saw a steady immigration from Africa, most notably Cape Verde, Angola and Guinea-Bissau, but also São Tomé and Príncipe, Mozambique and former Portuguese India in Asia.

Portugal saw migration waves due to labor shortages since 1999, first from Eastern Europe (1999–2002), in two distinctive groups, a &quot;Slav&quot; (Ukraine, Russia and Bulgaria) and an &quot;East Latin&quot; (Romania and Moldova), that stopped and started declining as the labour market became saturated.

Since 2003, most of the immigrants came from Brazil, China and the Indian subcontinent. Family reunification was seen as important for a successful integration in the country, thus the government eased it, and in 2006, more than 6 in 10 new immigrants were family members of legal foreign residents in the country.

There is also a significant number of elderly Western European residents in search of quality of life, namely from the United Kingdom, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium.

More recently, there is significant migration from the former Portuguese colony of Brazil, as since 2017 more than 30,000 Brazilians immigrate to Portugal annually.

Below is a summary table of the main foreign nationalities present in Portugal according to the latest AIMA data. As of December 31, 2023, there were 1,044,606 legally resident people in Portugal with foreign citizenship (about 9.82% of the population). These include both citizens born in Portugal with foreign citizenship and foreign immigrants. Descendants of immigrants are excluded (Portugal, like many European countries, does not collect data on ethnicity) and those who, regardless of place of birth or citizenship at birth, were Portuguese citizens (&quot;see also Portuguese nationality law&quot;). Among the latter are also naturalized citizens whose data are reported in the next table.

Below is a summary table of Portuguese citizenship acquisitions by foreigners residing in the country recorded between 2008 and 2022 for countries having recorded at least 1,000 naturalizations during the given timespan. During this period, 342,458 people (3.27% of the current Portuguese population) obtained Portuguese citizenship according to the latest Eurostat data. These people are not counted among foreigners (see above table) as they are Portuguese citizens in all respects.
===Net migration===

===Ethnic minorities and persons with disabilities===
Portugal does not collect ethnicity or racial data of its population.

Anti-racism laws prohibit and penalize racial discrimination in housing, business, and health services.

Discrimination against persons with disabilities in employment, education, access to health care, or the provision of other state services is illegal. The law mandates access to public buildings and to newly built private buildings for such persons.

== Languages ==
The main language spoken as first language by the overwhelming majority of the population is Portuguese. 
Other autochthonous languages spoken include:
* &quot;Caló&quot; (&quot;see also Caló language&quot;), the language of the Portuguese-Romani community. There are about 52,000 Romani people in Portugal.
* &quot;Mirandês&quot; (&quot;see also Mirandese language&quot;), officially recognised as an official language. It enjoys special protection in the area of Miranda do Douro. As of today, there are about 15,000 people who speak the language (0.14%).
* &quot;Barranquenhu (see also Barranquenho)&quot;, spoken in the town of Barrancos (in the border between Extremadura, Andalusia and Portugal). As of today, there are about 3,000 speakers of the language (0.03%).
* Minderico – a sociolect or argot spoken in Minde, practically extinct. There are about 150 speakers left
* Portuguese Sign Language, the official language for the deaf community in Portugal. There are about 30,000 deaf people (0.29%) in Portugal who use the language. Interestingly, the first teacher of deaf-mutes in France was Portuguese-Jew Jacob Rodrigues Pereira.

== Religion ==
The great majority of the Portuguese population belongs to the Roman Catholic Church. Religious observance remains strong in northern areas, while the population of Lisbon and southern areas are generally less devout.

Religious minorities include a little over 400,000 Protestants and Mormons (3.84% of the total population).

There are also about 100,000 Muslims (1%) and 45,000 Hindus (0.43%), most of whom came from Goa, a former Portuguese colony on the west coast of India (Some Muslims also came from former two Portuguese African colonies with important Muslim minorities: Guinea-Bissau and Mozambique).

There are also about 1,500 Jews, 2,000 Baha&#x27;i and 35,000 Sikh (0.34%)

Portugal is also home to about 17,000 Buddhists, mostly Chinese from Macau and a few Indians from Goa.

Portugal is still one of the most religious countries in Europe, most Portuguese believe with certainty in the Existence of God and religion plays an important role in the life of most Portuguese. According to the Pew Research Center, 40% of Portuguese Catholics pray daily.

<text>[[Politics]] in [[Portugal]] operates as a unitary multi-party semi-presidential representative democratic republic, whereby the Prime Minister of Portugal is the head of government, and the President of Portugal is the non-executive head of state which, although it is a somewhat ceremonial figure, has some significant political powers they exercise often. Executive power is exercised by the Government, whose leader is the prime minister. Legislative power is primarily vested in the Assembly of the Republic (the Portuguese parliament), although the government is also able to legislate on certain matters. The Judiciary of Portugal is independent of the executive and the legislature. The President exerts a sort of &quot;moderating power&quot;, not easily classified into any of the traditional three branches of government.

Since 1975, the party system has been dominated by the social democratic Socialist Party and the liberal-conservative Social Democratic Party, but in the 2024 snap elections, the far-right Chega managed to achieve 21% of seats in the Assembly of the Republic.

According to the V-Dem Democracy Indices Portugal was, in 2023, the 20th most electoral democratic country in the world.

==Political background==
The national and regional governments are dominated by two political parties, the centre-left Socialist Party (PS), a social-democratic party, and the centre-right, liberal-conservative Social Democratic Party (PSD), which have similar basic policies in some respects: both are pro-European, support NATO membership, welfare state and market economy. Other parties with seats in the parliament are Chega, the Portuguese Communist Party, the Left Bloc, the Ecologist Party &quot;The Greens&quot;, LIVRE, and People-Animals-Nature. The Communists and the Greens are in coalition as the Unitary Democratic Coalition.

In the Portuguese legislative election of 2011, the PSD won enough seats to form a majority government with the CDS-PP. The coalition, led by Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho, was supported by a majority in the Parliament of 132 MPs. The major opposition party was the Socialist Party (the party of the former prime minister José Sócrates, in office 2005–2011) with 74 MPs. Also represented were the Portuguese Communist Party (14 MPs), &quot;The Greens&quot; (2 MPs) and the Left Bloc (8 MPs), all to the left of the governing coalition.

In the 2015 elections, which the PSD and People&#x27;s Party (CDS-PP) contested as a coalition, Portugal Ahead, the government lost its absolute majority. The left-wing parties, the Socialist Party, Portuguese Communist Party, Ecologist Party &quot;The Greens&quot;, and Left Bloc, argued that as they were willing to form a coalition which would have a majority in the assembly, they ought to be invited to form the government, while Portugal Ahead, as the largest grouping, argued that they should be invited to form the government. After three weeks of uncertainty, the President designated Passos Coelho as prime minister, which was followed by the formation of a minority government. However, the Government Programmed was rejected by the Parliament. It was the shortest-lived Portuguese national government since the Carnation Revolution. Since then, the left-wing parties, led by the Socialist Party (PS), have formed the government. On 26 November 2015, there was established a PS minority government led by Prime Minister António Costa.

In the Portuguese legislative of 2019, the centre-left PS of incumbent Prime Minister Costa obtained the largest share of the vote, and the most seats. On 26 October 2019, there was established a new PS minority government led by Prime Minister António Costa. In the snap 2022 election the ruling PS won an outright majority. Following the Operation Influencer police searches, in November 2023, António Costa resigned and snap elections were called for 10 March 2024, which were won by the Democratic Alliance.

==History==
The first constitution was created in 1822 (following the Liberal Revolution of 1820), followed by a second in 1826, followed by a third in 1838 (after the Liberal Wars), a fourth in 1911 (following the 5 October 1910 revolution), and a fifth 1933 (after the 28 May 1926 coup d&#x27;état).

Portugal&#x27;s 25 April 1976 constitution reflected the country&#x27;s 1974–76 move from authoritarian rule to provisional military government to a representative democracy with some initial Communist and left-wing influence. The military coup in 1974, which became known as the Carnation Revolution, was a result of multiple internal and external factors like the colonial wars that ended in removing the dictator, Marcelo Caetano, from power. The prospect of a communist takeover in Portugal generated considerable concern among the country&#x27;s NATO allies. The revolution also led to the country abruptly abandoning its colonies overseas and to the return of an estimated 600,000 Portuguese citizens from abroad. The 1976 constitution, which defined Portugal as a &quot;Republic... engaged in the formation of a classless society,&quot; was revised in 1982, 1989, 1992, 1997, 2001, and 2004.

The 1982 revision of the constitution placed the military under strict civilian control, trimmed the powers of the president, and abolished the Revolutionary Council (a military body with legislative veto and quasi-judicial powers). The country joined the European Union in 1986, beginning a path toward greater economic and political integration with its richer neighbors in Europe. The 1989 revision of the constitution eliminated much of the remaining Marxist rhetoric of the original document, abolished the communist-inspired &quot;agrarian reform&quot;, and laid the groundwork for further privatization of nationalized firms and the government-owned communications media. The 1992 revision made it compatible with the Maastricht Treaty.

The current Portuguese constitution provides for progressive administrative decentralization and calls for future reorganization on a regional basis. The Azores and Madeira archipelagos have constitutionally mandated autonomous status. A regional autonomy statute promulgated in 1980 established the Government of the Autonomous Region of the Azores; the Government of the Autonomous Region of Madeira operates under a provisional autonomy statute in effect since 1976. Apart from the Azores and Madeira, the country is divided into 18 districts, each headed by a governor appointed by the Minister of Internal Administration. Macau, a former dependency, reverted to Chinese sovereignty in December 1999.

===I and II Constitutional Governments (1976–1978)===
The Socialist Party, under the leadership of Mário Soares, rose to power after the 1976 legislative elections and formed the I Constitutional Government. However, this government faced a lot of problems due to the country&#x27;s economic situation, and in 1978, the II Constitutional Government, a coalition between the Socialists and the Democratic and Social Centre, was sworn in. The coalition only lasted eight months and Mário Soares resigned.

===III, IV and V Constitutional Governments (1978–1980)===
President Eanes then nominated the III Constitutional Government, under the leadership of Alfredo Nobre da Costa, which was sworn in on late August 1978, but lasted just three months as it failed to gain Parliamentary support.

The IV Constitutional Government, under the leadership of Carlos Mota Pinto, was sworn in on late November 1978, but, like the previous government, lasted very little, eight months, due to its failure to pass policies in Parliament.

The president then swore in the V Constitutional Government, under the leadership of Maria de Lourdes Pintasilgo, the first and still only female prime minister in Portuguese history. The government managed the country until the early elections of December 1979.

===VI, VII, VIII Constitutional Governments (1980–1983)===
The Democratic Alliance, under the leadership of Francisco Sá Carneiro, won the 1979 legislative elections by a big margin and the VI Constitutional Government was sworn in in January 1980. Sá Carneiro&#x27;s tenure was short lived as he died in a tragic plane crash in December 1980.

In January 1981, the Social Democratic Party, the main party within the Democratic Alliance, elected Francisco Pinto Balsemão as leader and the VII Constitutional Government was sworn in. Internal issues within the Alliance forced a new government to take office, the VIII Constitutional Government, in September 1981, also led by Pinto Balsemão. Balsemão resigned in late 1982.

===IX Constitutional Government (1983–1985)===
The Socialist Party, under the leadership of Mário Soares, returned to power after the 1983 legislative election and formed a Central Bloc government, the IX Constitutional Government, between the two main parties, the Socialists and the Social Democrats. Soares resigned in June 1985 after the Social Democrats withdrew from government.

===X, XI and XII Constitutional Governments (1985–1995)===
The Social Democratic Party, under the leadership of Aníbal Cavaco Silva, rose to power after the 1985 legislative elections and formed a minority government. However, the government lost the confidence of Parliament in April 1987 after losing a non-confidence vote. After this, President Mário Soares called an early election for July 1987.

The 1987 early elections were held on 19 July and resulted in a landslide majority government for the Social Democrats, the first time a party won a majority on its own in democracy. The XI Constitutional Government, the first one to finish a full 4-year term in democracy, was sworn in on 17 August 1987. During this term, the PSD government initiated a big program of liberalization and privatization of several sectors of the economy.

In the 1991 election the Social Democrats were returned again to power and, also, with an absolute majority. It was the third consecutive election victory for the PSD, a record in democracy. The XII Constitutional Government was sworn in on 31 October 1991. After 1992, the economy fell into a recession and despite the recession being over by mid 1994, the government was badly hit and Cavaco Silva decided to not run for a fourth term as prime minister. Cavaco Silva&#x27;s 10-year tenure as prime minister is the longest, so far, in democracy.

===XIII and XIV Constitutional Governments (1995–2002)===
The Socialist Party, under the leadership of António Guterres, came to power following the October 1995 legislative elections. The Socialists later won a new mandate by winning exactly half the parliamentary seats in the October 1999 election, and constituting then the XIV Constitutional Government. Socialist Jorge Sampaio won the February 1996 presidential elections with nearly 54% of the vote. Sampaio&#x27;s election marked the first time since the 1974 revolution that a single party held the prime ministership, the presidency, and a plurality of the municipalities. Local elections were held in December 1997.

Prime Minister Guterres continued the privatization and modernization policies initiated by his predecessor, Aníbal Cavaco Silva (in office 1985–1995) of the Social Democratic Party. Guterres was a vigorous proponent of the effort to include Portugal in the first round of countries to collaborate and put into effect the euro in 1999. In international relations, Guterres pursued strong ties with the United States and greater Portuguese integration with the European Union while continuing to raise Portugal&#x27;s profile through an activist foreign policy. One of his first decisions as prime minister was to send 900 troops to participate in the IFOR peacekeeping mission in Bosnia. Portugal later contributed 320 troops to SFOR, the follow-up Bosnia operation. Portugal also contributed aircraft and personnel to NATO&#x27;s Operation Allied Force in Kosovo. Guterres resigned in December 2001 after a disappointing result in the local elections.

===XV Constitutional Government (2002–2004)===
Following the results of the 2002 early election, the XV Constitutional Government, led by José Manuel Durão Barroso, leader of the Social Democratic Party, in coalition with the People&#x27;s Party, whose leader, Paulo Portas, became Minister of Defence, was sworn in in April 2002. This government lasted two years because, in June 2004, Durão Barroso announced his resignation in order to become President of the European Commission.

===XVI Constitutional Government (2004–2005)===
After José Manuel Durão Barroso accepted the invitation to be the next European Commission President, a new government had to be formed. Though opposition parties called for general elections, President Jorge Sampaio named Pedro Santana Lopes, the new Social Democratic Party leader, as prime minister, who thus formed a new government, in coalition with the People&#x27;s Party. However, in December 2004, due to several controversies involving the government, the President dissolved the parliament and called for early elections. Santana Lopes resigned after the announcement of the President&#x27;s decision.

===XVII and XVIII Constitutional Governments (2005–2011)===
In the elections on 20 February, the Socialist Party obtained its largest victory ever, achieving an absolute majority for the first time in the party&#x27;s history. Prime Minister José Sócrates was sworn in by President Jorge Sampaio on 12 March. To many&#x27;s surprise, Sócrates formed a cabinet made up of roughly half senior members of the Socialist Party and half independents, notably including Diogo Freitas do Amaral, founder of the right wing People&#x27;s Party, who assumed office as Ministry of Foreign Affairs (he later resigned due to personal issues).

In the elections on 27 September 2009, The Socialist Party, led by incumbent Prime Minister José Sócrates, won the largest number of seats, but did not repeat the overall majority they gained in 2005. Sócrates was reconducted but lost his majority. The 2010 European debt crisis led Portugal to ask for a bailout from the IMF and the European Union. This situation led to the resignation of José Sócrates as prime minister and the President dissolved parliament and called an early election for June 2011.

===XIX and XX Constitutional Governments (2011–2015)===
In the elections held on 5 June 2011, the Social Democratic Party won enough seats to form a majority government with the People&#x27;s Party. The Government was led by Pedro Passos Coelho. It had 11 ministers and was sworn in on 21 June.

The Portuguese legislative election of 2015 was held on 4 October. The results display a relative victory of the right-wing coalition, but they also display a combined victory of the left-wing parties (including the Socialist Party), with a hung parliament (a right-wing single winner and a left-wing majority parliament). After the election, the XX Constitutional Government of Portugal had Pedro Passos Coelho (PSD) as the prime minister and lasted from 30 October 2015 to 26 November 2015. However, the Government Programme was rejected by the Parliament. It was the shortest-lived Portuguese national government since the Carnation Revolution.

=== XXI, XXII and XXIII Constitutional Governments (2015–2024) ===
The 21st cabinet of the Portuguese government since the establishment of the current constitution. It was established on 26 November 2015 as a Socialist Party (PS) minority government led by Prime Minister António Costa.

The Portuguese legislative election of 2019 was held on 6 October 2019. The centre-left Socialist Party (PS) of incumbent Prime Minister Costa obtained the largest share of the vote, and the most seats. The XXII Constitutional Government of Portugal was sworn in on 26 October 2019 as a Socialist Party (PS) minority government led by Prime Minister António Costa. In October 2021, the budget proposed by the government was rejected by Parliament, leading President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa to call an early election for January 2022.

The 2022 early elections were held on 30 January 2022. The election resulted in an absolute majority for the Socialist Party, the second in its history. However, the government swearing in was postponed because of a rerun in the overseas constituency of Europe, and the XXIII Constitutitional Government, led by Prime Minister António Costa, was only sworn in on 30 March 2022. António Costa resigned on 7 November 2023, following the Operation Influencer police searches into government contracts surrounding lithium and hydrogen businesses. The President dissolved parliament and called early elections.

=== XXIV Constitutional Government (2024–) ===
In the elections held on 10 March 2024, the Democratic Alliance, alliance between the Social Democratic Party, People&#x27;s Party and the People&#x27;s Monarchist Party, won enough seats to form a minority government. The Government led by Luís Montenegro has 17 ministers and was sworn in on 2 April 2024.

==Political powers==
Government in Portugal is made up of three branches originally envisioned by enlightenment philosopher Baron de Montesquieu: executive, legislative, and judicial. Each branch is separate and is designed to keep checks and balances on the others. The President&#x27;s powers, however, do not fall into either of the traditional three, forming instead a sort of &quot;moderating power&quot; over the government and the legislature.

The four main organs of the national government are the President, the Government (which includes the prime minister and the Council of Ministers), the Assembly of the Republic (Parliament), and the judiciary, made up of different hierarchies of courts (the Supreme Court of Justice and its lower courts, the Supreme Administrative Court and its lower courts, the Constitutional Court and the Court of Auditors).

===President===

The President, elected to a 5-year term by direct, universal suffrage, is also commander-in-chief of the armed forces. Presidential powers include appointing the prime minister and Council of Ministers, in which the President must be guided by the assembly election results; dismissing the prime minister; dissolving the assembly to call early elections; vetoing legislation, which may be overridden by the assembly; and declaring a state of war or siege, only with the approval of the assembly and on government advice.

The Council of State, a presidential advisory body, is composed of:
* The President of the Assembly of the Republic
* The Prime Minister of Portugal
* The President of the Constitutional Court of Portugal
* The Ombudsman of Portugal
* Both Presidents of the regional governments of the autonomous regions (Madeira and Azores)
* Former Presidents of the Republic
* Five citizens appointed by the President of the Republic
* Five citizens appointed by the Assembly of the Republic

The president, according to the election results, names the party that shall form a government, whose leader is appointed prime minister. The prime minister names the Council of Ministers, and the ministers name their Secretaries of State. A new government is required to define the broad outline of its policy in a program and present it to the assembly for a mandatory period of debate. Failure of the assembly to reject the program by a majority of deputies confirms the government in office.

====Presidential elections====

===Legislative branch===

Legislative power is exercised by the Assembly of the Republic, which is the parliament of Portugal, although the Government also has a more limited ability to legislate on some matters (on others, Parliament has exclusive legislative competence). It is also the body which holds the Government accountable and has the means to remove it from office at any time, as described earlier, primarily through a motion of no confidence, although alternative methods exist.

The Assembly of the Republic is a unicameral body composed of 230 deputies (that is, members of parliament). Elected by universal suffrage according to a system of proportional representation, deputies serve terms of office of 4 years, unless the president dissolves the assembly and calls for new elections. According to the constitution, members of the assembly represent the entire country, not the constituency from which they are elected.

====Political parties in legislative elections====

===Executive branch===

Executive power is exercised by the Government of Portugal. The Government is formed after the President appoints the prime minister based on election results, as described earlier – traditionally, the leader of the most voted party.

The Government can only remain in place for as long as the Parliament allows: the Parliament can remove the Government at the beginning by approving a motion of rejection to the introductory Government programme, or at any time by approving a motion of no confidence, either of which is achieved by a simple majority; the Government may also, of its own initiative, choose to present at any time a motion of confidence, which acts as the opposite of a motion of no confidence: if rejected, the Government is removed. Finally, the Government also relies on Parliament to approve the state budget, which also allows Parliament to indirectly force the Government to resign by rejecting its budget proposal. Thus, the Government, although not directly elected, is held accountable before Parliament, which is proportionally representative of the people. Typically, once the Government is removed from office, the President will call a snap election (also known as an early election).

Current government composition:

===Judicial branch===
The national Supreme Court is the court of last appeal in civil and criminal matters, which is described by the Constitution as &quot;the senior organ in the hierarchy of the courts of law&quot;. There is a separate system of courts for administrative and fiscal matters, for which the court of last appeal is the Supreme Administrative Court. During war time, the law provides for there being military courts. 

A thirteen-member Constitutional Court reviews the constitutionality of legislation. There is also a Court of Auditors.

==Administrative divisions==

There are two autonomous regions (&quot;regiões autónomas&quot;, singular &quot;região autónoma&quot;) with limited legislative powers besides the administrative ones: Azores and Madeira.
As purely administrative divisions, there are 18 districts (&quot;distritos&quot;), 308 municipalities (&quot;municípios&quot;) and 3,091 civil parishes (&quot;freguesias&quot;).
The districts are Aveiro, Açores (Azores)*, Beja, Braga, Bragança, Castelo Branco, Coimbra, Évora, Faro, Guarda, Leiria, Lisboa, Madeira*, Portalegre, Porto, Santarém, Setúbal, Viana do Castelo, Vila Real and Viseu.

<text>Portugal has a modern and flexible telecommunications market and a wide range of varied media organisations. The regulatory body overseeing communications is called ANACOM.

The country has one of the highest mobile phone penetration rates in the world (the number of operative mobile phones already exceeds the population). This network also provides wireless mobile Internet connections as well, and covers the entire territory. As of 2023, 94% of households had high-speed Internet services and 97% of companies had Internet access. Most Portuguese watch television through fibre-optic (2023: 66.2% of households). Paid Internet connections are available at many cafés, as well as many post offices. One can also surf on the Internet at hotels, conference centres and shopping centres, where special areas are reserved for this purpose. Free Internet access is also available to Portuguese residents at &quot;Espaços de Internet&quot; across the country.

==Broadband overview==
Portugal has a mid-sized but advanced telecoms market, with a steadily growing broadband subscriber base well served by cable, DSL and the emerging FTTx platforms. Mobile penetration is far above the European Union average, while the development of digital TV services has progressed under cautious regulatory guidance. The progressive liberalisation of the Portuguese market began at the beginning of the 1990s through the creation of the Portuguese Institute for Communications (ICP). Through a combination of specific deadlines for liberalisation and entry mechanisms for new market players, Portugal&#x27;s telecoms scene was successfully opened up to competition.
The country&#x27;s broadband market showed accelerated growth in 2010 not least due to its widespread cable and DSL networks, but also due to aggressive fibre deployment. Broadband services with up to 100 Mbit/s, 200 Mbit/s and even 1 Gbit/s speeds were launched in 2009. The country&#x27;s leading telecom operators have partnered up to build high speed next generation networks.
The government&#x27;s broadband initiative for 2009-2010 had the following two aims: (i) the connection of up to 1.5 million homes and businesses to the new fibre networks enabling them to benefit from improvements in high-speed Internet, TV and voice services; (ii) the achievement of 50 per cent broadband penetration among households by 2010. Both aims were reached.
At the end of 2023, the number of households connected to the fibre-optic networks (FTTH/B) by all operators stood at 3.24 million. The number of households with access by cable totalled 1.3 million. Nearly the totality of family households now have access to at least one high-speed network.

Telephones - main lines in use:
5.5million (2024)

<text>Transport in Portugal is diversified. Portugal has a network of roads, of which almost are part of a 44 motorways system. Brisa is the largest highway management concessionaire. With 89,015 km2, Continental Portugal has 4 international airports located near Lisbon, Porto, Faro and Beja. The national railway system service is provided by Comboios de Portugal. The major seaports are located in Leixões, Aveiro, Figueira da Foz, Lisbon, Setúbal, Sines and Faro.

==Roads==

In 1972, Brisa was to construct of roadways by the end of 1981. The first priority was a highway designated as A1, a stretch reaching from the capital of Lisbon north to Porto, Portugal&#x27;s second-largest city. This highway would become a crucial link to the industrial activity in the north of the country and experience the highest traffic volumes in Brisa&#x27;s network. Construction also began on the A2, which was projected to reach from Lisbon to resort areas on the southern coast.

Two years after the establishment of Brisa, the right wing dictatorship was overthrown by a leftist revolution. The new regime included Brisa in a program of nationalization, first taking control of 40 percent of the company and eventually gaining a 90 percent share. Road construction continued stretch by stretch under socialist control. As the first highway sections were completed on the A1 and A2, the government concession was expanded to include adjoining stretches. In addition, concessions were granted for expansions to the network: the A3 would extend the north–south highway from Porto up to the Spanish border, the A4 would reach east from Porto to the city of Amarante, and the A5 was to reach from Lisbon about west to the coast. However, during the first years of democratic government, the combined length of the network never exceeded through the 1980s. Transportation was seen as a priority in the 1990s, pushed by the growing use of automobiles and mass consumption.

In 1985, a new government led by the center-right Social Democrats headed by Prime Minister Aníbal Cavaco Silva, came to power in Portugal and began loosening the state&#x27;s control over economic activity. After years of slow progress, the government began an extensive investment program to bring the transportation infrastructure up to date. While some funds were earmarked for railroad and subway companies, the largest share went to highways. Brisa received a direct capital injection of PTE 17.7 billion in 1990. The investment was urgently needed, since traffic volume in Portugal was growing at a faster rate than any other country in the European Union. Average daily traffic volume increased at a rate about 4.5 percent more than the gross domestic product each year between 1990 and 1996. The government kept up its intensive program of annual investments, allowing Brisa&#x27;s network to grow from in 1990 to in 1995.

== Railways ==
===National rail system===
The principal train operator in Portugal is Comboios de Portugal. Rail infrastructure is maintained by Infraestruturas de Portugal.

===Urban mass transit===

The two largest metropolitan areas have subway systems: Lisbon Metro and Metro Transportes do Sul in the Lisbon metropolitan area and Porto Metro in the Porto Metropolitan Area, each with more than of lines. In Portugal, Lisbon tram services have been supplied by the &quot;Companhia de Carris de Ferro de Lisboa&quot; (Carris), for over a century. In Porto, a tram network, of three lines, began construction on 12 September 1895, the first in the Iberian Peninsula. All major cities and towns have their own local urban transport network, as well as taxi services.

==Airports==
Lisbon&#x27;s geographical position makes it a stopover point for many foreign airlines at airports all over the country. The government decided to build a new airport outside Lisbon, in Montijo, to replace Lisbon Portela Airport. Currently, the most important airports are in Lisbon, Porto, Faro, Funchal (Madeira) and Ponta Delgada (Azores). The national airline is TAP Air Portugal.

The Portuguese Armed Forces ({{langx|pt|Forças Armadas}}) are the military of Portugal. They include the General Staff of the Armed Forces, the other unified bodies and the three service branches: Portuguese Navy, Portuguese Army and Portuguese Air Force.

The President of the Republic is the head of the Portuguese military, with the title of &quot;Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces&quot; (&quot;Comandante Supremo das Forças Armadas&quot;). The management of the Armed Forces and the execution of the national defense policy is however done by the government (chaired by the Prime Minister) via its Minister of National Defense. The highest-ranking officer in the military is the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces, which has operational control of the Armed Forces during peacetime and assumes their full control when a state of war exists.

The Armed Forces are charged with protecting Portugal as well as supporting international peacekeeping efforts when mandated by North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the United Nations or the European Union.

Portugal was ranked the 3rd most peaceful country in the World in the Global Peace Index 2017, presently not having significant national security issues. The Portuguese Armed Forces have been thus focused in non-military public service activities and in external military operations. Recent external operations include anti-piracy action in the Gulf of Aden, the conflicts in the Central African Republic and in Afghanistan, the peacekeeping missions in East-Timor, Lebanon, Kosovo and Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the air policing of Iceland and the Baltic States.

Military units and other bodies are stationed all throughout Portuguese territory, including Continental Portugal, Madeira and the Azores.

The Portuguese Armed Forces were opened to women during the early-1990s. Portugal had mandatory conscription for all able-bodied men until November 2004.

==General principles==

===The national defense===
The national defense is the activity whose objectives are to guarantee the State sovereignty, the national independence and the territorial integrity of Portugal, as well as to assure the liberty and security of the populations and the protection of the fundamental values of the constitutional order against any external threat or aggression. The national defense also assures the fulfillment of the international military agreements of the State, accordingly with the national interest.

The Portuguese Armed Forces are responsible for the military defense, which is the military component of the national defense.

===The Armed Forces===
The Portuguese Armed Forces are an essential pillar of the national defense and are the structure of the State that has as its main mission the military defense of the Republic. They obey to the competent bodies of sovereignty, accordingly with the Constitution and the law, being integrated in the State direct administration through the Ministry of National Defense. The bodies of State directly responsible for the national defense and the Armed Forces are the following:
* President of the Republic
* Assembly of the Republic
* Government
* Superior Council of National Defense

The Minister of National Defense is the politician responsible for the elaboration and execution of the military component of the national defense policy, for the administration of the Armed Forces and for the results of their employment.

===System of forces===

The system of forces defines the set of capacities that should exist for the fulfillment of the missions of the Armed Forces. It encompasses the set of systems of forces of all branches of the Armed Forces. The system of forces includes two components:
* Operational component - includes the set of assets and forces to be employed operationally. It is the dynamic part of the system of forces, including mainly deployable elements, such as frigates, infantry battalions and flying squadrons. The operational component includes also some non-deployable operational command bodies. 
* Fix component - is the set of commands, units, establishments, bodies and services that are essential to the organization and general support of the Armed Forces and their branches. It is the static part of the system of forces, including only non-deployable elements, such as naval facilities, regiments and air bases.

===Structure of the armed forces===
The Portuguese armed forces&#x27; structure includes:
* the General Staff of the Armed Forces (EMGFA)
* the three branches of the Armed Forces: Navy, Army and Air Force
* the military bodies of command: Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces (CEMGFA), the Chief of Staff of the Navy, the Chief of Staff of the Army and the Chief of Staff of the Air Force
* the military bodies of advisement

===Guidelines===
The Armed Forces activity is mainly defined and oriented by the following strategic guidelines:
* The National Defense Law (&quot;Lei da Defesa Nacional&quot;, LDN) defines the general guidelines of the national defense, including the concept of national defense, the national defense policy, the responsibilities of the several bodies of State regarding national defense, the assignments and general structure of the Ministry of National Defense and of the Armed Forces, the participation of the citizens in the Homeland defense and the situation of State of War. The LDN is regularly updated, with the present version being the Law 21-A/2006.
* The Strategic Concept of National Defense (&quot;Conceito Estratégico de Defesa Nacional&quot;, CEDN) is the component of the national defense policy which defines the State&#x27;s priorities in terms of defense, accordingly with the national interest. The present version of the CEDN was approved by the Council of Ministers through its Resolution 19/2013.
* The Organic Basic Law of the Organization of the Armed Forces (&quot;Lei Orgânica de Bases da Organização das Forças Armadas&quot;, LOBOFA) defines the organization of the Armed Forces. The present version of the LOBOFA is the Organic Law 1-A/2009.
* The Strategic Military Concept (&quot;Conceito Estratégico Militar&quot;, CEM) – due to the Strategic Concept of National Defense, it defines the conceptual guidelines of actuation of the Armed Forces and the general guidelines for its preparation, employment and sustainment. It is elaborated by the Council of Chiefs of Staff, approved by the Minister of National Defense and confirmed by the Superior Council of National Defense. The present CEM in force is the CEM 2014.
* The Military Programming Law (&quot;Lei de Programação Militar&quot;, LPM) establishes the programming of the public investment of the Armed Forces in terms of armament and equipment, for the modernization and operationalization of the system of forces, through the building of their capacities. The present version of the LPM is the Organic Law 7/2015.

==Current deployments==
The national deployed forces (&quot;forças nacionais destacadas&quot; or FND) are units or teams deployed by the Portuguese Armed Forces in foreign missions, mostly in the scope of NATO, the United Nations or the European Union.

==History==
{{Main|Military history of Portugal}}

===Background===

The history of the Portuguese military itself begins in the 12th century with the creation of the Kingdom of Portugal. Since the early beginning, the Kingdom had naval and ground forces. The Portuguese Navy exists as a permanent force since 1317, however non-permanent naval forces existed already before, with their first known naval engagement occurring in 1180. The Portuguese ground forces were established as a standing army in 1570, however they had existed since the 12th century, as the non-permanent &quot;hoste&quot;. The Navy and the Army would remain independent from each other for hundreds of years.

By the early 20th century, some joint military and national defense bodies had been created but these had mostly mere political coordination responsibilities. The administration of the several forces of the military remained in charge of separate government departments, respectively the Navy Ministry for the Navy (&quot;Marinha&quot;), the War Ministry for the Metropolitan Army (&quot;Exército Metropolitano&quot;) and the Colonies Ministry for the Colonial Military Forces (&quot;Forças Militares Coloniais&quot;). Operationally, the service branches were also completely independent from each other, with totally separated chains of command.

During the 1930s, plans were laid to merge all of the previously mentioned ministries under a single defense ministry. However, the service branches lobbies for the maintenance of their autonomy – represented by their separate government departments – politically opposed and were able to block this reorganization for the next couple of decades.

Nevertheless, the need to defend the Overseas Empire against possible foreign aggression during World War II, did lead to a significant step being taken during this period for an increased integration of the several military services, when the Colonial Military Forces were placed under the dependency of the War Ministry, which then became in charge of all Portuguese ground forces (metropolitan and colonial).

===Establishment of the unified Armed Forces===
Lessons learned from World War II, the start of the Cold War and the creation of NATO (which Portugal integrated as a founding member) partially ended the objections for the creation of a joint command for the military forces. In 1950, the roles of Minister of National Defense and of Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces (CEMGFA) are created. To the CEMGFA were given almost all the responsibilities until then assigned to the majors-generals of the Navy and of the Army (service branches military commanders), whose roles were at the same time extinct. This can be considered the beginning of the existence of the Portuguese Armed Forces as an unified organization.

However, opposition from both of the then existing military branches prevented the formation of a single ministry for the military. The political solution for this was to keep the existing Navy and Army ministries and to create the role of Minister of National Defense but without its own ministry, instead integrating the Government&#x27;s Presidency Office. The Minister of National Defense directed an umbrella organization, named the National Defense Department which included the CEMGFA, the General Secretariat of National Defense (SGDN, &quot;Secretariado-Geral da Defesa Nacional&quot;) and the Under-Secretariat of State of the Aeronautics (&quot;Subsecretariado de Estado da Aeronáutica&quot;). As the Navy and Army ministers continued to exist and to administer their own branches, the Minister of Defense had merely coordinating roles regarding the Navy and the Army. The SGDN served as the Defense staff support organization, being headed by the CEMGFA. It was foreseen to be remodeled in order to be transformed in the general staff and joint management body of the Armed Forces, but this transformation would only occur in 1974, when the SGDN became the General Staff of the Armed Forces (EMGFA).

Despite all the challenges, the operational integration of the Armed Forces rapidly progressed in the 1950s. As part of this integration, the role of commander-in-chief was established in each of the Overseas territories, as a permanent unified commander of the local forces of the three branches. Mainly during the Overseas War, these commanders-in-chief would assume increasing responsibilities, until achieving full operational command of all forces assigned to their theater of operations, leaving the territorial service branch leadership with mere logistical responsibilities.
The Military Aeronautics (Army aviation branch) – which already had a high degree of autonomy since 1937 – becomes an entirely separate branch of service of the Armed Forces in 1952, at the same time starting to control the Portuguese Naval Aviation (Navy aviation service). This third branch of the Armed Forces would soon become officially designated &quot;Portuguese Air Force&quot; (&quot;Força Aérea Portuguesa&quot;), with the fully integration of the previous Naval Aviation becoming complete in 1958. Unlike the other services which had their own separate ministries, the Air Force was under the fully dependency of the Minister of National Defense via the Under-Secretariat of State of the Aeronautics. In 1961, the status of this department would be upgraded, it becoming the Secretariat of State of the Aeronautics.

In 1953, the National Republican Guard ceased policing the military, with the establishment of the Military Police by the Army. Later, the other service branches would create their respective military police type forces: the Air Police for the Air Force and the Naval Police for the Navy.

===Overseas conflicts===
{{Main|1961 Indian annexation of Goa|Portuguese Colonial War}}

Between 1961 and 1974, the Portuguese Armed Forces would be engaged against emerging nationalist movements in several of the Portuguese African provinces. These set of conflicts are collectively referred as the Overseas War in Portugal. In the scope of the Cold War, it was a decisive ideological struggle and armed conflict in African (Portuguese Africa and surrounding nations) and Portuguese European mainland scenarios. Unlike other European nations, the Portuguese regime did not leave its African overseas provinces during the 1950s and 1960s. Several armed independence movements, most prominently led by communist parties who cooperated under the CONCP umbrella and pro US groups became active in these areas (especially in Angola, Mozambique and Portuguese Guinea).

The Portuguese Armed Forces were able to maintain a large military campaign for 13 years, in these three different theaters of operations, thousands of kilometers apart from each other and from the European mainland. This was achieved with almost no external support, in contrast with the nationalist movements which were backed by communist countries and even by some western ones. The Army suffered the majority of the casualties with 8290 soldiers killed in action while the Air Force lost 346 airmen and the Navy lost 195 sailors.

During the conflict, in each theater of operations, the operational command of the forces of the navy, army and air force was successively transferred from each territorial service branch command to joint commands, led by the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces in that specific theater. Thus the three branches of the military were able to achieve a high level of operational integration, allowing for an effective cooperation between them, the optimization of their scarce assets and the ability to fight as a single cohesive force. The logistics side however was not able to reach such high levels of integration, mainly because each service branch continued to be administered by its own government department with its own supply chain and different standards.

Due to the nature of the conflict, commando-type forces achieved great importance. With the war&#x27;s evolution, these assumed almost all of the mobile and offensive operations, with the more conventional forces remaining responsible mainly for the defensive assignments. By 1961, each service branch had created its own light infantry force oriented for asymmetric warfare. The Air Force created the Parachute Rifles (&quot;Caçadores Páraquedistas&quot;) in 1956, the Army first raised the Special Rifles (&quot;Caçadores Especiais&quot;) in 1960 which were later replaced by the Commandos (&quot;Comandos&quot;) in 1962 and the Navy deployed the Marines (&quot;Fuzileiros&quot;), a force reactivated in 1961. The Portuguese military also counted with a number of paramilitary forces, including the Special Groups (&quot;Grupos Especiais&quot;) and the Arrows (&quot;Flechas&quot;).

The Portuguese Armed Forces were also involved in a brief conventional armed conflict with the Indian military, when the latter invaded the Portuguese India in December 1961. Facing overwhelmingly superior forces and after 36 hours of combat, the Portuguese India Commander-in-Chief, General Vassalo e Silva, surrendered to the Indian Forces. Portuguese forces suffered 30 dead and 57 wounded, with almost 3500 personnel being taken as prisoners of war, these being released six months later. The Indian Armed Forces officially recognized to have suffered 76 casualties during the invasion.

===Democratic Republic===
{{See also|Carnation Revolution}}

On the morning of 25 April 1974, the Armed Forces Movement (MFA, &quot;Movimento das Forças Armadas&quot;) – consisting mostly of junior officers of the three service branches – launched a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;, known as the Carnation Revolution, which would bring an end to the New State regime and shortly the Overseas War. While the revolt included several military units located on the mainland, the forces that departed from the Cavalry School located in Santarém, led by captain Salgueiro Maia, were the ones that managed to obtain the surrender of prime-minister Marcelo Caetano after a stand-off at the National Republican Guard headquarters in Lisbon, where he and some other members of the Government had taken refuge.

However, after the revolution and for about a year and a half, the Portuguese military would become highly politicized and split into several factions. By the summer of 1975, the tension between these was so high, that the country was on the verge of civil war. The forces connected to the extreme left-wing launched a further &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; on 25 November but the Group of Nine, a moderate military faction, immediately initiated a counter-coup. The main episode of this confrontation was the successful assault on the barracks of the left-wing dominated Military Police Regiment by the moderate forces of the Commando Regiment, resulting in three soldiers killed in action. The Group of Nine emerged victorious, thus preventing the establishment of a communist state in Portugal and ending the period of political instability in the country.

The Ministry of National Defense would be created during this period of instability. However this ministry had no power over the Armed Forces, his role was simply to act as a connection between the military and the Government. It was the Revolution Council – created in 1975, consisting only of military officers and chaired by the President of the Republic – that had the full control over the Armed Forces, which meant these were completely independent from the civilian administration. The Government military departments (Navy Ministry, Army Ministry and Secretariat of State of the Aeronautics) were disbanded, with each service branch chief of staff assuming the roles of the former ministers, under the coordination of the CEMGFA, to whom was given a status equivalent to that of the Prime Minister of Portugal. This organization would remain in place until 1982, when the Revolution Council was disbanded after the first revision to the 1976 Constitution. The Armed Forces were again placed under the subordination of the civilian administration, more specifically being integrated in the Ministry of National Defense.

With the decolonization and the end of the Overseas War, the Portuguese military would change from an asymmetric war oriented force to a conventional war oriented force, focused in defense of Western Europe from a possible Soviet invasion.

Meanwhile, the 1980s would see the creation of special operations, namely the Army&#x27;s Special Operations Forces and the Navy&#x27;s Special Actions Detachment. In 1990, the Air Force would create Combat Rescue teams (&quot;Resgate em Combate&quot; or &quot;RESCOM&quot;) for CSAR operations but in 2006 these were extinct and replaced by the Force Protection Unit (&quot;Unidade de Protecção da Força&quot; or &quot;UPF&quot;) whose mission is to provide security for the Air Force elements deployed on international missions.

===Current===

The collapse of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact triggered a deep transformation of the Armed Forces. They transited from being a conscription based and defensive oriented Armed Forces to gradually becoming a fully professional and expeditionary warfare oriented force, starting to participate in international missions, most of them under the mandate of the United Nations, the European Union and the NATO, besides organizing some unilateral missions abroad on their own.

The conscription was gradually reduced since the early 1990s, with almost no conscripts serving the Armed Forces by the end of that decade. The formal abolishment of the conscription in time of peace for all men was however only implemented in 2004.

In 1993, the Portuguese Army deployed a communications battalion to Mozambique, as part of the UNOMOZ, this being the first participation of the Portuguese Armed Forces in international missions, with a complete military unit. After Mozambique, the Portuguese Military deployed forces to international missions in a number of countries, including Angola, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Timor-Leste, Kosovo, Lebanon, Afghanistan and Lithuania, besides deploying military observers and other individual elements to other countries. Recent Defense policy confirmed the assumption that most considerable operations would be undertaken under international organizations mandates, with Portugal not entering alone in a major military engagement since the 1961–1974 overseas conflict.

Nonetheless, the Portuguese Military have also conducted a number of unilateral and independent peace-enforcing and humanitarian military missions, namely in Guinea-Bissau (1990, 1998, and 1999) and in Angola (1992). The Operation Crocodile conducted in Guinea-Bissau in 1998 was notable, by evidencing the capacity of the Portuguese Armed Forces – despite its small size and limitation of means – to rapidly mount a military operation abroad in a scale that is typically only achievable by major military powers. This operations was mainly aimed at the rescuing of thousands of Portuguese and other foreign nationals caught in the middle of the civil conflict that erupted in Guinea-Bissau and included the deployment of naval and air forces, the landing and occupation of the Port of Bissau by Portuguese Marines, amphibious and helicopter landings in several places of the Guinean coast for the rescuing of civilians, medical and humanitarian aid to the civil population and the support to the peace talks between the two antagonizing parties.

A Military Program Law (&quot;Lei de Programação Militar&quot;) was launched in 2002 to start the complete modernization of the Armed Forces. Considerable re-equipment of the military started in 2003, led by Defense Minister Paulo Portas, who managed to launch a series of re-equipment programs, including those of new submarines (&quot;Tridente&quot;-class), frigates (&quot;Bartolomeu Dias&quot;-class) and off shore patrol ships (Project NPO 2000 / &quot;Viana do Castelo&quot; class) for the Navy, of armored vehicles (Pandur) for the Army and of heavy helicopters (EH-101) for the Air Force. Ironically one of the most basic challenges – the replacement of the 7.62×51mm battle rifles by 5.56×45mm assault rifles – failed during his mandate due to the soldiers clinging onto their cheap and highly reliable locally made FBP G3.

Some important re-equipment programs were however later canceled or suspended mainly due to cuts in the Defense budget, including the building of a multipurpose amphibious ship (Project NavPoL), the building of coastal patrol ships (Project NPC 2000) and the acquisition of helicopters (EC635 and NH90) for the Army Light Aviation Unit. Another important challenge faced, in terms of equipment, is the lack of funds for the replacement of the Alouette III helicopters and the Alpha Jet advanced trainer jets of the Air Force, which, if not addressed in due course, may compromise the future capacity of the Armed Forces to continue to do the complete training of their own aircraft pilots.

Despite the financial cuts in Defense, all international missions assigned to the Portuguese military have been fulfilled without limitations.

Recently purchased equipment include new main battle tanks (Leopard 2A6) in 2008 and new coastal patrol vessels (&quot;Tejo&quot;-class) in 2014. The process acquisition of the ex-French amphibious assault ship &quot;Siroco&quot; – as an alternative to the suspended NavPoL – failed in 2015, with the Portuguese Armed Forces continuing not having an asset which allows them to easily deploy forces to abroad on a larger scale, enhancing its expeditionary capacity.

In the 2010s, the Portuguese Armed Forces created the Immediate Reaction Force (FRI, &quot;Força de Reação Imediata&quot;), aimed at providing an autonomous national response capability to intervene abroad in complex situations to conduct operations as the possible of evacuation of Portuguese citizens from countries under crisis or tension. The FRI includes naval, ground, air and special operations components. Its initial core has an operational readiness of 48 hours and has permanently assigned assets of the three branches of the Armed Forces.

=== Future ===

In April 2013, the Portuguese Government approved a structural reform of the National Defense, named &quot;Defesa 2020&quot; (&quot;Defense 2020&quot;). It was done with the objective of defining the level of ambition of the Armed Forces by establishing the guidance parameters for strategic planning, reinforcing the leading responsibility of the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces in the execution of the approved military strategy, reducing human resources while at the same time improving their management and enhancing the coordination between the General Staff of the Armed Forces, the branches of the Armed Forces and the Ministry of National Defense.

&quot;Defesa 2020&quot; establishes the existence of three sets of force:
* Immediate Reaction Force (FRI, &quot;Força de Reação Imediata&quot;) – a rapid action force, focused in missions such as the evacuation of Portuguese citizens in crisis or conflict areas and response in national complex emergency situations.
* Permanent Forces in Sovereignty Action (FPAS, &quot;Forças Permanentes em Ação de Soberania&quot;) – forces focused in the continuous missions of national sovereignty or jurisdiction areas of national responsibility, including the air defense, the maritime and aerial patrolling, surveillance and inspection, land surveillance when required, search and rescue and finally the nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological defense, public interest and disaster response.
* Modular Set of Forces (CMF, &quot;Conjunto Modular de Forças&quot;) – forces assigned to Portuguese international commitments deployed for periods of six months, capable of engaging in three simultaneous minor operations or in a single major operation. These forces are known as National Deployed Forces (FND, &quot;Forças Nacionais Destacadas&quot;).

Future equipment programs are also in course. In May 2019, a new &quot;Military Programming Law&quot; was published, which will regulate the founding of the military investments programs until 2030. Some of the main next military investments present in this document are:

* Portuguese Air Force
** 5 Embraer KC-390 military transport aircraft. The KC-390 incorporates an important percentage of Portuguese developed technology and is being partially built in Portugal;
** 6 Lockheed P-3C Orion Cup;
** Ground attack aircraft for close air support;
** 9 Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk for aerial firefighting;
** 2 additional AgustaWestland AW119 Koala;
** Replacement of the Chipmunk Mk.20 training aircraft fleet;
** Modernization of the Socata TB 30 Epsilon, Falcon 50, C130 Hercules and P3C Cup + Orion fleets;
** AIM-9X Sidewinder missiles and Warning Receiver SPS-45(V)5 systems for the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon fleet.
** Surveillance Unmanned aerial vehicles (Class 2 - above 150kg and Class 3 - above 600kg);

* Portuguese Navy
** 1 amphibious transport dock vessel – locally known has &quot;Navio Polivalente Logístico&quot; (NPL);
** 1 landing platform - to operate unmanned aerial vehicles and unmanned underwater vehicles;
** 2 replenishment oiler – to replace &quot;Berrio&quot;-class fleet tanker;
** 6 &quot;Viana do Castelo&quot;-class patrol vessels;

** Around 200 Joint Light Tactical Vehicles;
** New Unmanned aerial vehicles;
** Anti-tank guided weapons.

==Organization==

===General Staff of the Armed Forces===
{{Main|Armed Forces General Staff (Portugal)}}
The General Staff of the Armed Forces (EMGFA, &quot;Estado-Maior-General das Forças Armadas&quot;) is the superior military body and supreme headquarters of the Portuguese Armed Forces. It is responsible for planning, directing and controlling the usage of the three service branches in their fulfillment of assigned missions and tasks. The EMGFA is headed by the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces and includes:

* Deputy for the Planning and Coordination
* Joint Command for the Military Operations
* Azores Operational Command
* Madeira Operational Command
* Military Strategic Planning Division
* Resources Division
* Directorate of Communications and Information Systems
* Military Security and Intelligence Center (CISMIL)
* Directorate of Military Health
* Directorate of Finance
* General Support Command

The EMGFA also has under its dependency the following bodies:
* Military University Institute 
* Military missions abroad
* Hospital of the Armed Forces
* Military Health Teaching, Training and Investigation Unit

===Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces===
The Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces (CEMGFA, &quot;Chefe do Estado-Maior-General das Forças Armadas&quot;) is the principal military adviser of the Minister of National Defense and is the chief with the highest authority in the hierarchy of the Portuguese Armed Forces.

The CEMGFA is an admiral or a general (four star rank) of one of the branches of service, appointed by the President of the Republic by proposal of the Government. Before being proposed to the President, the nominee has to be presented by the Minister of National Defense to the Council of Chiefs of Staff for a previous hearing. If the nominee is refused by the President, the Government has to present another option. Traditionally, there is a rotation of the branch of service that provides the CEMGFA, but this is not mandatory and not always happens.

The CEMGFA is responsible for the planning and implementation of the operational military strategy, having under his hierarchic dependency the chiefs of staff of the branches of service for the matters that evolve the preparedness, the employment and the sustainment of the forces and assets of the operational component of the system of forces and responding before the Government – through the Minister of National Defense – for the military response capacity of the Armed Forces. He/she is the operational commander of the Armed Forces, being responsible for the employment of all forces and assets of the operational component of the system of forces in operational missions. The sustainment of the forces and assets referred before is under the branches of service responsibility, with the respective chiefs of staff being under the CEMGFA dependency for that.

The branch of service chief of staff who is longer in the function replaces the CEMGFA, in case of his absence or impediment.

===Branches of the Armed Forces===

The Portuguese Armed Forces include three branches, these being the Navy, the Army and the Air Force. Created centuries ago, the Navy and the Army are much older than the integrated Armed Forces themselves. The Air Force is however younger, being created as a separate branch already after the establishment of the integrated Armed Forces. The branches of service have as their principal mission to participate, in an integrated form, in the defense of the Republic, in the terms defined by the Constitution and the law, being mainly aimed for the generation, preparation and sustainment of the forces of the operational component of the system of forces. The branches also guarantee their own specific missions established by particular laws and also guarantee the operational missions given to them by the CEMGFA.

The increasing integration and standardization of the different branches of service meant that their organizations gradually approached. Presently, all the three branches have an identical organizational model that includes: 
* a chief of staff
* a branch staff
* central bodies of administration and management
* a component command
* bodies of advisement
* bodies of inspection
* base bodies 
* elements of the operational component of the system of forces

The chiefs of staff serve as the branch commanders. The staffs are the bodies for planning and decision support of the respective chiefs of staff, being able also to assume roles of management, control, advisement or inspection. The central bodies of administration and management have a functional character and are intended to guarantee the management and execution in specific fundamental areas and activities as the human, material, financial, information and infrastructures resources management. The component commands (naval, land and air) are intended to support the chiefs of staff in their command roles. The component commands can be put under the direct dependency of the CEMGFA for the exercise of his command roles. The bodies of advisement are intended to support the decision of the chiefs of staff in special and important matters regarding the preparedness, discipline and administration of the branch. The bodies of inspection are intended to support the control and evaluation function of the chiefs of staff. The base bodies are those aimed at the training, the sustainment and the general support of the branch. The elements of the operational component of the system of forces are the forces and assets of the branch intended for the accomplishment of the operational missions.

Besides the above referred standard bodies, the Navy also includes the Hydrographic Institute and the Maritime Search and Rescue Service, while the Air Force also includes the Air Search and Rescue Service.

Until recently, the Navy also included the National Maritime Authority. Statutorily, the Maritime Authority is now an entirely separate legal entity, but it continues to be headed by the Chief of Staff of the Navy and continues to be mainly administered, supported and staffed by the Navy. The same happens with the National Aeronautic Authority in relation to the Air Force, the difference being that this Authority was already created as a separate legal entity.

===Chiefs of staff of the branches===
The chiefs of staff of the Navy, of the Army and of the Air Force command their respective branches, being the military chiefs with the higher authority in each of the branches hierarchy and being the principal advisors of the Minister of National Defense and of the CEMGFA in all matters related with their branches. Inside each branch, the respective chief of staff is the only officer with a four-star rank (admiral in the Navy and general in the other two branches).

The chiefs of staff are part of the operational command structure of the Armed Forces, serving as deputy commanders of the CEMGFA. While they report to the CEMGFA in the operational, military intelligence and security, military higher learning, military health and other joint matters, they report directly to the Minister of National Defense in the matters related with the current management of their branches resources.

The chiefs of staff of the branches are appointed by the President of the Republic, by government proposal, in an analogous process of that of the CEMGFA appointment. The CEMGFA must be heard before a name is proposed to the President.

===Military bodies of advisement===
The military bodies of advisement of the armed forces are the Council of Chiefs of Staff and the higher councils of the several branches.

The Council of Chiefs of Staff is the principal military coordinating body, being also the body of advisement of the CEMGFA. It is presided over by the CEMGFA and also includes the chiefs of staff of the three branches of service. Other military entities may be invited to participate in their meetings, but without voting rights.

In each of the branches, there is a higher council presided by the respective chief of staff. These are the Council of the Admiralty, the Higher Council of the Army and the Higher Council of the Air Force. The branches may have other advisement bodies like the military careers councils (the councils of class in the Navy, the councils of arm or service in the Army and the councils of specialty in the Air Force).

==Branches of the armed forces==

===Navy===
{{Main|Portuguese Navy}}

The Navy (&quot;Marinha&quot;, with its armed branch also being referred as the &quot;Armada&quot;) is the naval component of the Portuguese Armed Forces. It includes around 8000 military personnel (including around 1500 marines), 40 commissioned ships and 50 auxiliary vessels. Unlike the other service branches that have an almost purely military role, the Navy historically has had a wide scope of non-military activities, namely serving as the Portuguese maritime administration, and being responsible for the tutelage over of the merchant marine, fisheries, maritime authority and maritime research affairs. The responsibility over the non-military maritime activities has however been gradually transferred to other organizations since the disbandment of the Navy Ministry in 1974, with only a few – as the maritime authority and the hydrographic survey – remaining now under the Navy tutelage.

The Portuguese Navy is one of the oldest in the world, with its first known naval engagement occurring in 1180. A permanent Navy exists since 1317, when the role of Admiral of Portugal was created.

The Navy is headed by the Chief of Staff of the Navy and includes the Navy Staff, the Personnel, the Material, the Finance and the Information Technologies superintendences, the Naval Command (naval component command, with five subordinate maritime zone commands), the Council of the Admiralty and the Inspection-General of the Navy. The base bodies of the branch include the Lisbon Naval Base, the Support Unit of the Central Facilities of the Navy, the Naval School, the technical schools (Marines, Hydrography and Oceanography, Divers and Naval Technologies), the Integrated Center of Naval Training and Evaluation and the squadrons (Surface Ships, Submarines and Helicopters). The elements of the operational component of the system of forces of the Navy include the Marine Corps Command, the naval and marine forces, the operational naval, marine and divers assets and units, the command centers and posts and the operations support centers. The Navy includes the Marine Corps (&quot;Corpo de Fuzileiros&quot;), which is a naval infantry force that serves in the roles of naval force protection, amphibious force projection and maritime special operations. The Marines themselves include the Special Actions Detachment, which is the special operations unit of the Navy. The Sappers Divers Group is the combat divers unit of the Navy. The Navy further includes the Hydrographic Institute, the Maritime Search and Rescue Service and the International Maritime Law Commission.

===Army===
{{Main|Portuguese Army}}

The Army (&quot;Exército&quot;) is the land component of the Portuguese Armed Forces and its larger branch. Presently, it includes around 14 000 military personnel. The principal equipment of the Army includes 37 main battle tanks (Leopard 2A6), 300 tracked APCs (M113), 188 wheeled APCs (Pandur II), 139 tactical vehicles (URO VAMTAC), 100 other armored vehicles and 80 field artillery weapons. In 2019, the FN SCAR assault rifle was chosen as the principal infantry weapon, gradually replacing the 7.62mm HK G3 and the several models of 5.56mm rifles used by paratroopers and other special troops.

The Portuguese Army can be considered one of the oldest armies of the world, with its origins going back to the Royal &quot;Hoste&quot; of the 12th century, in the early period of the Kingdom of Portugal. The foundations of a standing army were established in 1570, with the creation of the &quot;Ordenanças&quot;. In the middle of the 17th century, the Portuguese land forces started to be referred as the &quot;Exército&quot;.

The Army is headed by the Chief of Staff of the Army and includes the Army Staff, the Personnel and the Logistics commands, the Directorate of Finance, the Land Forces Command (land component command, with two subordinate military zone commands) and the Inspection-General of the Army. The base bodies of the branch are divided by the scopes of obtainment and administration of human resources (including psychology, recruiting and selection centers and offices), of readying of forces (including 21 regiments of several arms, the Special Operations Troops Centre and the Army Intelligence and Military Security Center), of logistical support (including the Army Geospatial Intelligence Center, two service support regiments, the Army Material General Support Unit and two health centers), of teaching and training (including the Military Academy, the School of the Arms, the School of the Services, the Army Sergeants School, the Military College and the Army Pupils Institute) and of divulgation and preservation of military culture (including military museums, archives, the Army Band and the Army Fanfare). The Army includes also bodies that support other branches of the Armed Forces, including the Military Prison Establishment, the Military Laboratorial Unit of Biological and Chemical Defense and the Military Unit of Veterinary Medicine. The elements of the operational component of the system of forces of the Army include the Land Forces Command, the formations and operational units commands, the military zones commands and the general support and emergency military support forces. The formations include the Rapid Reaction Brigade, the Mechanized Brigade and the Intervention Brigade. The special troops of the Army include the Paratroopers, the Commandos and the Special Operations Troops, whose units are now all integrated in the Rapid Reaction Brigade.

Traditionally, the Army used to be divided in branches that were designated &quot;arms&quot; if they had a mainly combatant role and designated &quot;services&quot; if their role was logistical. The main branches were the arms of cavalry, infantry, artillery, engineering and communications and the services of health, military administration, materiel and transportation. Each branch constituted an organization that usually included a branch directorate, a branch school, units and a cadre of personnel. As organizations, these branches were abolished in 1993, but they still exist as occupational groups. Also, most of the Army units continue to be associated to a branch, which in most cases correspond to the main role of the respective unit.

===Air Force===
{{Main|Portuguese Air Force}}

The Air Force (&quot;Força Aérea&quot;) is the air component of the Portuguese Armed Forces and its younger branch. It includes around 6000 personnel and 100 aircraft.

The Portuguese Air Force was established as an independent branch of service in 1952, when the Military Aeronautics arm was completely separated from the Army, at the same time starting to control the Naval Aviation that was part of the Navy.

The Air Force is headed by the Chief of Staff of the Air Force and includes the Air Force Staff, the Air Force Personnel and the Air Force Logistics commands, the Air Force Directorate of Finance, the Air Command (air component command, with two subordinate air zone commands) and the Inspection-General of the Air Force. The base bodies of the branch include the Air Force Academy, the Military and Technical Training Center of the Air Force, five air bases, two maneuver aerodromes, a transit aerodrome and four radar stations. The elements of the operational component of the system of forces of the Air Force include the operational planning bodies, the Air Command and Control System, the flying units and the anti-aircraft intervention units. The flying units include two training squadrons (TB 30 Epsilon and Alpha-Jet), one fighter squadron (F-16 AM), one attack squadron (F-16 AM), three transport squadrons (C-130, C-295M, Falcon 900 and Falcon 50), two helicopter squadrons (EH-101 and AW119), two maritime patrol squadron (Lockheed P-3C and C-295M Persuader) and one Air Force Academy squadron (ASK-21, OGMA Chipmunk Mk 20 (modif) and L-23 Super Blaník). The &quot;Polícia Aérea&quot; (Air Police) is the ground combat force of the Air Force, which serves as its military police, force protection and ground anti-aircraft defense element, including a special forces unit, this being the Tactical Operations of Protection Core (NOTP).

==The National Republican Guard==
{{Main|National Republican Guard (Portugal)}}

The Nacional Republican Guard (GNR, &quot;Guarda Nacional Republicana&quot;) is a special corps of troops that has the special feature of being a military force that is not part of the Armed Forces.

It is a gendarmerie type security force, made up of around 26 000 military personnel, that is part of the internal security system. It is responsible for the preventive policing of most of the rural areas of the country, the patrolling of the major highways, the customs enforcement and the coastal control. It also performs some special missions like the providing of ceremonial military State honor guards, the security of the Presidential, Parliament and Foreign Ministry palaces, the environment and nature protection and the rescue and forest firefighting. In time of peace, the GNR is subordinated to the minister of Internal Administration, except in the scope of uniforms, military doctrine, equipment and armament within which is subordinated to the minister of National Defense.

Although not being part of the Armed Forces, the GNR can be placed under the operational command of the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces in the cases foreseen in the statutes governing the National Defense, the Armed Forces, the state of siege and the state of emergency. In the scope of its military missions, the GNR is specially adapted for the fulfillment of military operations other than war. Forces of the GNR have been deployed in international missions in high conflict countries that did not fit with the use of a civilian police force, but where it was not considered politically appropriate to deploy units of the Armed Forces. These international deployments may be done in the scope of the multinational specialized units (MSU) of the European Gendarmerie Force, as it happened with the GNR deployment in Iraq.

==Special forces==

The Portuguese Armed Forces include a number of different types of special forces, distributed by its three branches.

In the Army, these are generically referred as the &quot;special troops&quot; or the &quot;light infantry&quot; and represent more than 20% of the total strength of the branch. The Army special troops include the Paratroopers, the Commandos and the Special Operations Troops. The Paratroopers are a mainly parachute light infantry force, that however also include some non-infantry specialized units. The Paratroopers in turn include the Air-Land Pathfinders Company, which is a special parachute reconnaissance unit. The Commandos are a light assault infantry force, specialized in conducting high risk conventional operations. The Special Operations Troops is the Army unit specialized in unconventional warfare.

The Navy has the Marines Corps (&quot;Corpo de Fuzileiros&quot;) as its special forces. These are a light naval infantry force, specialized in amphibious landings, base and ship security, high seas boarding and naval military police. The Marines include the Special Actions Detachment which is the Navy&#x27;s special operations unit dedicated to the unconventional warfare in naval and coastal environment. The Marines also include the PelBoard (Boarding Platoon) teams, that are specialized in high risk visit, board, search, and seizure (VBSS) actions. The Sappers Divers Group is the Navy&#x27;s specialized combat divers unit, which however is not usually considered a special forces unit.

The present special forces unit of the Air Force is the Tactical Operations of Protection Core (NOTP). This unit is part of the Air Police and is mainly dedicated to the protection of the forces and assets of the Air Force deployed in high risk areas.

==Personnel==
Currently, the Portuguese Armed Forces include 32,992 military personnel, of which 12% are women. The majority of the personnel is in the Army (54%), followed by the Navy (26%) and the Air Force (20%). Conscription in time of peace was fully abolished in 2004 and, since then, 100% of the military personnel is professional.

===Military service===
The defense of the Fatherland is a right and a duty of all the Portuguese. The Portuguese citizens have military obligations from the age of 18 years to the age of 35 years.

The military service include the following situations:
* Effective service - is the situation of the citizens when they are at the service of the Armed Forces. It includes effective service in the QP (career personnel), RC (contract personnel) and RV (volunteer personnel) or due to call or mobilization.
* Recruiting reserve - is made of the Portuguese citizens, from the age of 18 years to the age of 35 years, who never served in the Armed Forces, but can be object of an exceptional recruiting.
* Availability reserve - is made of the Portuguese citizens who have served in the Armed Forces, from the end of their effective service until the end of their military obligations. To call effects, the availability reserve situation includes the six subsequent years after the effective service.

In time of war, the military obligations age limits can be changed by law.

===Career and voluntary personnel===
In time of peace, the military personnel falls in two main groups: career personnel (permanent personnel) and volunteer (temporary personnel). In case of war, these two groups are added with conscript personnel.

Career personnel (QP, &quot;Quadro Permanente&quot;) includes the persons who choose the military profession as their permanent life career. Admission to this career requires the graduation in one of the higher education service academies for officers or in one of the military technical schools for non-officers. QP personnel only includes officers and sergeants in the Army and the Air Force, but it also includes other ranks in the Navy. Other ranks in the Army and the Air Force are entirely volunteer.

Volunteer personnel includes the persons who usually have a civilian profession, but volunteer to serve temporarily in the military. They might serve in roles related specifically with their civilian professions (e.g.: engineers, legals, psychologists or medics) or in general military roles. They include officers, sergeants and other ranks. Volunteer personnel are further subdivided in two groups: contract regime (RC, &quot;Regime de Contrato&quot;) and volunteer regime (RV, &quot;Regime de Voluntariado&quot;). While RC personnel serves for between two and six years, RV personnel serves only for 12 months. Special RC regimes with the duration of up to 20 years are foreseen to be created for roles whose training and technical demands make desirable long periods of service. Personnel in RV can apply to serve in RC after their termination of their period of service.

===Ranks and categories===
{{Main|Military ranks of Portugal}}
Accordingly, with their level of responsibility and authority, Portuguese military personnel are divided in three categories: officers (&quot;oficiais&quot;), sergeants (&quot;sargentos&quot;) and other ranks (&quot;praças&quot;). Officers are further divided in three subcategories: general officers (&quot;oficiais generais&quot;), senior officers (&quot;oficiais superiores&quot;) and junior officers (&quot;oficiais subalternos&quot;).

===Occupational groups===
Accordingly, with their training and role, each member of the Portuguese Armed Forces is part of an occupational group, to each of which corresponds a career and a particular list of promotion. These occupational groups have different specific designations in each branch of service.

The Navy occupational groups are named &quot;classes&quot;. For the officers, the classes are navy (M), naval engineers (EN), naval administration (AN), marines (FZ), naval physicians (MN), naval senior technicians (TSN), technical service (ST), health technicians (TS) and musicians (MUS). For the enlisted, the classes are administrative (L), communications (C), auto mechanics-drivers (V), electro mechanics (EM), electro technicians (ET), marines (FZ), maneuvers (M), naval machinists (MQ), divers (U), musicians (B), operations (O), stewards (T) and weapons technicians (A).

The Army occupational groups are designated &quot;corps of general officers&quot;, &quot;arms&quot; and &quot;services&quot;. The corps of general officers include all generals, who may originate from the arms or from some of the services officer careers, but with only those originating from the arms being able to achieve the ranks above that of major-general. The arms are mostly careers associated with combatant roles while the services are mostly careers associated with logistical roles. For the officers, the arms are infantry (INF), artillery (ART), cavalry (CAV), engineering (ENG) and communications (TM) and the services are military administration (ADMIL), materiel (MAT), medicine (MED), pharmacy (FARM), veterinary (VET), dentistry (DENT), nursery, diagnostic and therapeutic technicians (TEDT), chiefs of music band (CBMUS), communications exploration technicians (TEXPTM), communications maintenance technicians (TMANTM), materiel maintenance technicians (TMANMAT), personnel and secretariat technicians (TPESSECR), transportations technicians (TTRANS), Army general service (SGE) and parachutist general service (SGPQ). For the sergeants, the arms are infantry (INF), artillery (ART), cavalry (CAV), engineering (ENG), communications (TM) and parachutists (PARAQ) and the services are military administration (AM), materiel (MAT), medicine (MED), pharmacy (FARM), veterinary (VET), music (MUS), clarions (CLAR), personnel and secretariat (PESSECR), transportations (TRANS), Army general service (SGE) and amanuensis (AMAN).

The Army volunteers occupational groups are analogous to the arms and services, but correspond to more specific qualifications. They include functional areas subdivided in specialties for officers and sergeants and specialties for other ranks. The functional areas for the officers and sergeants are mechanized/motorized infantry (AF01), light infantry (AF02), field artillery (AF03), anti-aircraft artillery (AF04), cavalry (AF05), Army police (AF06), communications (AF10), transportation (AF18), materiel (AF21), administration (AF22), personnel and secretariat (AF23), engineering (AF24), senior support technicians (AF25), health – medicine (AF26), health – nursery (AF26), health – nursery, diagnostic and therapeutic (AF27), dental health (AF28), veterinary health (AF29) and pharmacy. The specialties for the other ranks are field (Esp-01), mechanics (Esp-02), auto mechanics (Esp-03), engineering equipment mechanics (Esp-04), panel beater mechanics (Esp-05), auto body painter mechanics (Esp-06), services (Esp-07), audiovisual-multimedia (Esp-08), audiovisual-graphics (Esp-09), services saddler-upholstery (Esp-10), services psychometric laboratory operator (Esp-11), engineering sapper (Esp-12), NBC sapper (Esp-13), military light vehicles driving (Esp-14), military heavy vehicles driving (Esp-15), Army police (Esp-16), communications (Esp-17), music (Esp-18), health (Esp-19), paratroopers (Esp-20), special operations (Esp-21), commandos (Esp-22), construction (Esp-23), plumbing (Esp-24), construction carpenter (Esp-25), construction electrician (Esp-26), engineering heavy equipment operator (Esp-27), metalworking (Esp-28), farrier (Esp-29), catering (Esp-30), bakery (Esp-31) and rescue and assistance systems operator (Esp-32).

The Air Force occupational groups are designated &quot;specialties&quot;. The officers specialties include pilots-aviators (PILAV), aeronautic engineers (ENGAER), aerodromes engineers (ENGAED), electrical engineers (ENGEL), physicians (MED), aeronautical administration (ADMAER), jurists (JUR), psychologists (PSI), navigators (NAV), communications and cryptography operations technicians (TOCC), meteorology operations technicians (TOMET), air circulation and traffic radar operations technicians (TOCART), interception conduct operations technicians (TOCI), air materiel maintenance technicians (TMMA), ground materiel maintenance technicians (TMMT), electrical materiel maintenance technicians (TMMEL), armament and equipment maintenance technicians (TMAEQ), infrastructures maintenance technicians (TMI), supply technicians (TABST), IT technicians (TINF), personnel and administrative support technicians (TPAA), health technicians (TS), air police (PA) and chiefs of music band (CHBM). The enlisted personnel specialties include communications operators (OPCOM), meteorology operators (OPMET), air circulation and traffic radar operators (OPCART), detection radar operators (OPRDET), IT operators (OPINF), assistance and aid systems operators (OPSAS), air materiel mechanics (MMA), ground materiel mechanics (MMT), electricity mechanics (MELECT), electronics mechanics (MELECA), aircraft electricity and instruments mechanics (MELIAV), armament and equipment mechanics (MARME), supply (ABS), infrastructure construction and maintenance (CMI), air police (PA), secretariat and service support (SAS) and musicians (MUS).

===Uniforms and insignia===
As is usual in most of the Armed Forces in the world, each branch has its own uniform regulation which is distinct from those of the other service branches. The traditional color of the Portuguese military uniforms, since the middle of the 18th century, was the &quot;azul ferrete&quot; (very dark blue). This is still the color of the full dress uniforms of the three service branches.

The service dress uniform colors are the navy blue (Winter) or white (Summer) for the Navy, grey for the Army and air force blue for the Air Force. The 2019 Army uniform regulation abolished the olive green No.2 Army service dress uniform.

All the three branches have a camouflaged battledress uniform in the DPM pattern (from 1998 to 2010, the Air Force used instead the U.S. Woodland pattern). These camouflage patterns replaced the traditional Portuguese vertical lizard pattern that was in use in the three service branches from the early 1960s to the late 1990s. In the latte 2018, the Portuguese Army started to experiment the &quot;Sistemas de Combate do Soldado&quot; (Soldier&#x27;s Combat Systems) individual equipment system for the dismounted soldiers, which includes the new &quot;Multiterreno&quot; camouflage pattern of the Multicam-style. The &quot;Multiterreno&quot; became the official camouflage pattern for the Army field and garrison uniforms in 2019.

The members of most of the branches, units or specialties of the three branches of the Armed Forces are identified by the wearing of berets whose colors are emerald green (Paratroopers), black (Army generic), navy blue (Marines), air force blue (Air Police), red (Commandos), moss green (Special Operations) and blue (Navy generic). The 2019 Army uniform regulation abolished the traditional brown beret, with black becoming the generic color of the Army berets. Until then, black berets were reserved for use by the Cavalry.

On the contrary of the uniforms, there is a standard common model of rank insignia used in the uniforms of the three service branches. The existence of a common rank insignia system has been in force since 1761, when the Portuguese Army and Navy become one of the first militaries in the world to establish a rank insignia regulation, that was common for the two existing branches at the time. The present system of rank insignia was established in 1911 and is an evolution of the previous ones. Its generic rank devices consists in stars for the general officers, in stripes for the rest of the officers, in Portuguese shields for the senior sergeants and in chevrons for the rest of the sergeants and the other ranks. There is a specific rank insignia for the admirals or generals invested in the office of Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces, consisting in four golden stars, which differ from the silver stars worn by the rest of the four-star rank officers (chiefs of staff of the service branches).

<text>Foreign relations of Portugal are linked with its historical role as a major player in the Age of Discovery and the holder of the now defunct Portuguese Empire. Portugal is a European Union member country and a founding member of NATO. It is a committed proponent of European integration and transatlantic relations. João Gomes Cravinho is the current Minister of Foreign Affairs of Portugal.

==Historical==
Historically, the focus of Portuguese diplomacy has been to preserve its independence, &quot;vis-à-vis&quot;, the danger of annexation by Spain, and the maintenance of the Anglo-Portuguese Alliance, which officially came into being in 1386, and with the United Kingdom as a successor to England, it is still in place today.

Other goals have also been constant such as the political stability of the Iberian Peninsula and the affirmation of Portuguese interests in Europe and the Atlantic (also in the Indian and Pacific Oceans throughout different moments in history).

==International organizations==

Portugal was a founding member of NATO (1949), Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (1961), and European Free Trade Area (1960); it left the latter in 1986 to join the European Economic Community, which would become the European Union (EU) in 1993. In 1996, it co-founded the Community of Portuguese Language Countries (CPLP). The country is a member state of the United Nations since 1955.

Recently, the primacy of the United States and inter-governmental organizations such as NATO and the United Nations have also been paramount in the affirmation of Portugal abroad.

Portugal has been a significant beneficiary of the EU. It was among the top beneficiaries of the EU-15 between 1995 and 2004 (only behind Spain and Greece in absolute terms, and behind Ireland and Greece in a per capita basis). Portugal is a proponent of European integration and held the presidency of the European Union for the second time during the first half of 2000, and again in the second half of 2007. Portugal used its term to launch a dialogue between the EU and Africa and to begin to take steps to make the European economy dynamic and competitive. In 2002, the euro began to circulate as Portugal&#x27;s currency. José Sócrates, as Prime Minister of Portugal, presided over the rotative Presidency of the Council of the European Union for the period July–December 2007. In this post, Sócrates and his team focused on the EU-Brazil (1st EU-Brazil summit) and EU-African Union (2007 Africa-EU Summit) relations, as well as in the approval of the Treaty of Lisbon.

Portugal was a founding member of NATO; it is an active member of the alliance by, for example, contributing proportionally large contingents in Balkan peacekeeping forces. Portugal proposed the creation of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries (CPLP) to improve its ties with other Portuguese-speaking countries. Additionally, Portugal has participated, along with Spain, in a series of Ibero-American Summit. Portugal held the chairmanship of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) for the year 2002. The chairman-in-office was Portuguese Foreign Minister António Martins da Cruz.

==Disputes==
Portugal holds claim to the disputed territory of Olivença on the Portugal-Spain border.

<text>Telecommunications in Yemen provides information about the telephone, Internet, radio, and television infrastructure in Yemen.

==Infrastructure==

Since unification in 1990, efforts have been made to create a national telecommunications network.

The infrastructure of the domestic system consists of microwave radio relay, cable, tropospheric scatter, GSM, and CDMA. Fixed-line and mobile-cellular teledensity remains low by regional standards.

The international network consists of three Intelsat (two Indian Ocean, and one Atlantic Ocean), one Intersputnik, and two Arabsat satellite earth stations, and a microwave radio relay to Saudi Arabia and Djibouti. Yemen is a landing point for the international submarine cable Fiber-Optic Link Around the Globe (FLAG).

In 2005 TeleYemen announced it would invest in the FALCON high-capacity loop cable system, which will improve Internet access, including broadband capability, and also expand international call accessibility.

==Radio and television==
The state-run Republic of Yemen Television and Republic of Yemen Radio operate the country&#x27;s television and radio networks, respectively. There are two state-run TV stations; two state-run national radio stations and five local stations; stations from Oman and Saudi Arabia can be accessed (2007).

==Internet usage==
Yemen had 2.349 million Internet users in 2011, up from 295,232 in 2008, and 270,000 in 2006. These low numbers are attributed to the high cost of computer equipment and connections in combination with the population&#x27;s low level of income, as well as to the restricted bandwidth available on Yemen&#x27;s outdated telephone network. There were 33,206 Internet hosts in 2012.

There are five Internet service providers in Yemen.

The top-level domain for Yemen is .ye.

==Providers==
TeleYemen is the exclusive provider of international telecommunications for Yemen—fixed-line and wireless mobile companies, telex, and Internet services—and is one of the mobile-phone operators. In 2003 the government-owned Public Telecommunications Corporation assumed full control of TeleYemen, and a year later it awarded a five-year management contract to France Telecom.

In 2001 two private companies won 15-year licenses to provide mobile phone services. The growth of the companies&#x27; networks has resulted in coverage of about 60 percent of the population, but threats to internal security coupled with poor consumer payment history remain obstacles to future growth. In August 2005, the government awarded a contract to a joint venture between China Mobile and a group of Yemeni investors to take a 55 percent stake in Yemen&#x27;s third mobile network; the government will retain a 25 percent share. In August 2006, the same conglomerate was awarded a contract for a fourth mobile network. The four mobile network providers currently present in the mobile phone market are Yemeni Omani United (YOU, previously MTN Yemen), Sabafon, Yemen Mobile, and Y (Y Telecom).

<text>As a direct consequence of the country&#x27;s poverty, Yemen compares unfavorably with its Middle Eastern neighbors in terms of transportation infrastructure and communications network. The roads are generally poor, although several projects are planned to upgrade the system. There is no rail network, efforts to upgrade airport facilities have languished, and telephone and Internet usage and capabilities are limited. The Port of Aden has shown a promising recovery from a 2002 attack; container throughput increased significantly in 2004 and 2005. However, the expected imposition of higher insurance premiums for shippers in 2006 may result in reduced future throughput. The announcement in summer 2005 that the port&#x27;s main facility, Aden Container Terminal, would for the next 30 or more years be run by Dubai Ports International brings with it the prospect of future expansion.

==Roads==
Considering Yemen&#x27;s size, its road transportation system is extremely limited. Yemen has 71,300 kilometers of roads, only 6,200 kilometers of which are paved. In the north, roads connecting Sanaa, Taizz, and Al Hudaydah are in good condition, as is the intercity bus system. In the south, on the other hand, roads are in need of repair, except for the Aden–Taizz road.

In November 2005, the World Bank approved a US$40 million project to upgrade 200 kilometers of intermediate rural roads and 75 kilometers of village-access roads as part of a larger effort to strengthen Yemen&#x27;s rural-road planning and engineering capabilities. Plans are underway to build an estimated US$1.6 billion highway linking Aden (in the south) and Amran (in the north). The road will include more than 10 tunnels and halve the travel time between the southern coast and the northern border with Saudi Arabia.

Travel by road in Yemen is often unsafe. Within cities, minivans and small buses ply somewhat regular routes, picking up and dropping off passengers with little regard for other vehicles. Taxis and public transportation are available but often lack safety precautions. Despite the presence of traffic lights and traffic policemen, the U.S. Embassy advises drivers to exercise extreme caution, especially at intersections.

While traffic laws do exist, they are not always enforced. Drivers sometimes drive on the left side of the road, although right-hand driving is specified by Yemeni law. No laws mandate the use of seat belts or car seats for children. The maximum speed for private cars is 100 kilometers per hour (62.5 miles per hour), but speed limits are rarely enforced. Furthermore, there are many underage drivers in Yemen. Many vehicles are in poor repair and lack basic parts such as functional turn signals, headlights, and taillights. Pedestrians, especially children, and animals are a hazard in both rural and urban areas. Beyond main intercity roads, which are usually paved, the rural roads generally necessitate four-wheel-drive vehicles or vehicles with high clearance.

The British government has a clear warning for their military and civilian employees, or British tourists, about using the roads in Yemen: “In the event of a breakdown of law and order access routes in and out of major cities may be blocked. If you wish to drive outside Sana’a you will need prior permission from the Yemen Tourist Police. Travel permits may take at least 24 hours to be issued and are easiest to obtain through a travel agent. Travel without such permission is likely to result in detention and possible deportation. You should be aware that the consular assistance we can offer outside Sana’a is limited due to restrictions on travel. There have been disturbances in Aden, Lahij and al-Dhali’, which have resulted in closures of the Aden-Sana’a road. These have been short-lived but if you intend to travel by road you should check that the road is open before starting your journey. You can drive in Yemen on an International Driving Permit. Driving standards are poor and mountain roads hazardous. You should avoid all road travel outside the main cities at night. Care should also be taken to avoid minefields left over from Yemen&#x27;s civil wars. Travelling off well-used tracks without an experienced guide could be extremely hazardous, particularly in parts of the south and the central highlands.&quot;

==Railways==

Yemen does not have any railways, despite several proposals. At the beginning of the 20th century, the Ottoman Empire suggested that the Hejaz railway be extended to Yemen, but this never materialized. In 1916 the Royal Engineers built a metre gauge railway from Ma&#x27;alla in Aden to Sheikh &#x27;Othman. This was later extended to El Khudad, a total distance of . The line was operated by the North Western Railway of India until it closed in 1929. More recently, in 2005, the Yemeni government began to investigate rail connections as part of an overall initiative to upgrade its transportation infrastructure. In 2008 the Gulf Cooperation Council announced that it had agreed to include Yemen in plans for an integrated regional rail system and launched feasibility studies. Yemen has expressed preference for a coastal route beginning in Aden.

==Ports and merchant marine==

Yemen&#x27;s main ports are Aden, Al Hudaydah, Mukalla, and Mocha; Aden is the primary port. In addition, Ras Isa serves as the loading point for oil exports, and a small amount of cargo passes through Nishtun.

Facilities at Aden consist of the Maalla Terminal and the Aden Container Terminal (ACT), which opened in March 1999. The port can handle ro-ro ships, container ships, cargo ships, as well as tankers. In November 2003, following the October 2002 bombing of the French supertanker Limburg off the Yemen coast and the resultant dramatic drop in throughput at the Aden port, the Port of Singapore Authority sold its majority stake in the ACT back to the Yemeni government. In June 2005, Dubai Ports International was selected to manage and operate the ACT (and possibly Maalla Terminal) under a 30-year or longer contract; the Yemeni government will remain a minority shareholder. The Port of Aden has recovered well from the 2002 bombing. In 2004 it had annual traffic of approximately 2,000 vessels and 318,901 twenty-foot-equivalent units of containers, mostly handled by the ACT. For 2005, the port handled 317,897 twenty-foot-equivalent units of containers, more than double the amount for 2003. For the first seven months of 2006, the port handled 207, 687 twenty-foot-equivalent units of containers. However, in May 2006 the London insurance market&#x27;s Joint War Committee placed Yemen on its list of “areas of perceived enhanced risk,” which is expected to add a war-risk insurance premium to ships operating in the country&#x27;s coastal waters. This added premium, coupled with the availability of more secure ports in neighboring countries, will likely result in reduced throughput in Yemen&#x27;s ports in the near future.

There are 3 ships ( or over) totaling / (one cargo ship and 2 petroleum tankers) (1999 est.).

The International Maritime Bureau reports offshore waters in the Gulf of Aden are high risk for piracy; numerous vessels, including commercial shipping and pleasure craft, have been attacked and hijacked both at anchor and while underway; crew, passengers, and cargo are held for ransom; the presence of several naval task forces in the Gulf of Aden and additional anti-piracy measures on the part of ship operators reduced the incidence of piracy in that body of water by more than half in 2010.

The Yemen Coast Guard was established in 2002. According to the US Coast Guard website, they helped the Yemen Coast Guard with their patrol boats: “US Coast Guard Awards Contract to Build Two 87-foot Protector-class Coastal Patrol Boats for the Yemen Coast Guard. September 11, 2009. The Coast Guard awarded a $28.2 million contract to Bollinger Shipyards, Inc., in Lockport, La., on September 11, 2009, to build two 87-foot Protector-class Coastal Patrol Boats for the Yemen Coast Guard. The Office of International Acquisition (CG-922) at the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) received a request from the Navy International Programs Office (IPO) to procure these boats on May 13, 2009. The USCG anticipates the delivery to Yemen in August 2011. This procurement is the latest in a series of projects, which further strengthen the longstanding relationship between the US Coast Guard and the Yemen Coast Guard. Since 2003, the USCG has delivered eight 44-foot Motor Life Boats, twelve 25-foot Defender Response Boats, and four 42-foot Fast Response Boats (SPC-NLB) to the Yemen Coast Guard. The USCG has also provided 26 mobile training team visits and 54 resident training slots in USCG schools to the Yemen Coast Guard.”

Yemen also has some lighthouses that are maintained for sea navigation by the Yemen Ports Authority, an extension of the “Port of Aden.”

==Inland Waterways==
Yemen has no waterways of any significant length.

==Civil Aviation and Airports==

Yemen has 57 airports, 17 of which have paved runways. Of the 57 airports, 5 are international: Aden International, Sanaa International, Taizz, Rayyan, and Al Hudaydah. A major reconstruction and expansion of Aden International was completed in 2001, including a new runway that can handle large, long-haul aircraft. Plans to make that airport a regional cargo hub, with an &quot;air cargo village&quot; by 2004 appear to have failed. Although construction began in January 2003, by the end of the year the managing company had dissolved.

Yemenia is the national airline; in 1996 it absorbed South Yemen, the former national carrier. It is expected that Yemenia, which is currently 49 percent owned by the Saudi Arabian government and 51 percent owned by the Yemen government, will eventually be privatized, but there has been resistance from the Saudis. In 2001 the airline carried 858,000 passengers. Because the airline&#x27;s existing fleet of 12 airplanes is rapidly becoming outdated, in 2002 three new aircraft were leased for eight years, and in early 2006 the airline announced plans to acquire six new aircraft, with options for an additional four, beginning in 2012.

The country can be split into two areas: the low and flat lands in the west and north, and the higher lands with minor hills in the east and south. The former, including the reclaimed polders and river deltas, make up about half of its surface area and are less than above sea level, much of it actually below sea level. An extensive range of seawalls and coastal dunes protect the Netherlands from the sea, and levees and dikes along the rivers protect against river flooding. A recent global remote sensing analysis suggested that there were 1,025 km2 of tidal flats in the Netherlands, making it the 31st ranked country in terms of tidal flat area. The rest of the country is mostly flat; only in the extreme south of the country does the land rise to any significant extent, in the foothills of the Ardennes mountains. This is where Vaalserberg is located, the highest point on the European part of the Netherlands at above sea level. The highest point of the entire country is Mount Scenery (887 metres or 2,910 ft), which is located outside the European part of the Netherlands, on the island of Saba in the Caribbean. The Netherlands is located at mouths of three major European rivers (Rhine, Maas or Meuse, and Scheldt).

In November 2016, the Netherlands and Belgium agreed to cede small, uninhabited parcels of land to reflect a change in course of the river Meuse (or Maas, in Dutch). The land swap is to take effect as of 2018.

==Climate==

The predominant wind direction in the European Netherlands is southwest, which causes a mild maritime climate, with moderately warm summers and cool winters, and typically high humidity. This is especially true close to the Dutch coastline, where the difference in temperature between summer and winter, as well as between day and night is noticeably smaller than it is in the southeast of the country.

Ice days—maximum temperature below —usually occur from December until February, with the occasional rare ice day prior to or after that period. Freezing days—minimum temperature below —occur much more often, usually ranging from mid-November to late March, but not rarely measured as early as mid-October and as late as mid-May. If one chooses the height of measurement to be above ground instead of , one may even find such temperatures in the middle of the summer. On average, snow can occur from November to April but sometimes occurs in May or October too.

Warm days—maximum temperature above —are usually found in April to October, but in some parts of the country these warm days can also occur in March, or even sometimes in November or February (usually not in , however). Summer days—maximum temperature above —are usually measured in from May until September, tropical days—maximum temperature above —are rare and usually occur only in June to August.

Precipitation throughout the year is distributed relatively equally each month. Summer and autumn months tend to gather a little more precipitation than the other months, mainly because of the intensity of the rainfall rather than the frequency of rain days (this is especially the case in summer when lightning is also much more frequent).

The number of sunshine hours is affected by the fact that because of the geographical latitude, the length of the days varies between barely eight hours in December and nearly 17 hours in June.

The following table is based on mean measurements by the KNMI weather station in De Bilt between 1991 and 2020. The highest recorded temperature was , reached on 25 July 2019 in Gilze-Rijen. The lowest temperature in the Netherlands was recorded at Winterswijk on 27 January 1942, when the temperature dropped to .

<doc id="56976" wikidata="Q3067862" url="?curid=56976" title="Federal Energy Regulatory Commission">
<text>The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is an independent agency of the United States government that regulates the interstate transmission and wholesale sale of electricity and natural gas and regulates the prices of interstate transport of petroleum by pipeline. FERC also reviews proposals to build interstate natural gas pipelines, natural gas storage projects, and liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals, in addition to licensing non-federal hydropower projects.

FERC was created by the U.S. Congress in 1977 in the aftermath of the 1973 oil crisis. FERC is an independent agency, despite being part of the U.S. Department of Energy. It is headed by five commissioners who are nominated by the U.S. president and confirmed by the U.S. Senate. There may be no more than three commissioners of one political party serving on the commission at any given time.

== Primary duties ==
The responsibilities of FERC include the following:
* Regulating the transmission and sale of natural gas for resale in interstate commerce;
* Regulating the transmission of oil by pipelines in interstate commerce;
* Regulating the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce;
* Licensing and inspecting private, municipal, and state hydroelectric projects;
* Approving the siting of and abandonment of interstate natural gas facilities, including pipelines, storage and liquefied natural gas;
* Ensuring the reliability of high voltage interstate transmission system;
* Monitoring and investigating energy markets;
* Using civil penalties and other means against energy organizations and individuals who violate FERC rules in the energy markets;
* Overseeing environmental matters related to natural gas and hydroelectricity projects and major electricity policy initiatives; and
* Administering accounting and financial reporting regulations and regulating businesses of regulated companies.

== Jurisdiction and authorities ==
FERC is a large independent regulatory agency, within the United States Department of Energy, that participates in business oversight. The President and Congress do not generally review FERC decisions, but the decisions are reviewable by the federal courts. FERC is self-funding, in that Congress sets its budget through annual and supplemental appropriations and FERC is authorized to raise revenue to reimburse the United States Treasury for its appropriations, through annual charges to the natural gas, oil, and electric industries it regulates.

FERC is independent of the Department of Energy political structure because FERC activities &quot;shall not be subject to further view by the Secretary [of Energy] or any officer or employee of the Department&quot;. The Department of Energy can, however, participate in FERC proceedings as a third party.

FERC has promoted voluntary formation of regional transmission organizations (RTOs) and Independent System Operators (ISOs) to eliminate the potential for undue discrimination in access to the electric grid; it has made key decisions expanding its own power in regional and interregional transmission planning and cost allocation through the landmark Order Nos. 1000, 1920, 1977, and 2023.

FERC investigated the alleged manipulation of electricity market by Enron and other energy companies, and their role in the California electricity crisis. FERC has collected more than $6.3 billion from California electric market participants through settlements. Since passage of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, FERC has imposed, through settlements and orders, more than $1 billion in civil penalties and disgorgement of unjust profits to address violations of its anti-market manipulation and other rules.

FERC regulates approximately 1,600 hydroelectric projects in the U.S. It is largely responsible for permitting construction of a large network of interstate natural gas pipelines. FERC also works closely with the United States Coast Guard to review the safety, security, and environmental impacts of proposed LNG terminals and associated shipping.

== Commissioners ==
FERC is composed of up to five commissioners who are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate to staggered five-year terms. The President appoints one of the commissioners to be the chairman of FERC, the administrative head of the agency. FERC is a bipartisan body; no more than three commissioners may be of the same political party. Commissioners may continue in office past the end of their term if a successor has not yet been confirmed, up to the end of the current session of Congress. The commissioners are:

=== Past commissioners ===
=== Chairmen ===
== History ==
=== Federal Power Commission===
The Federal Power Commission (FPC), which preceded FERC, was established by Congress in 1920 to allow cabinet members to coordinate federal hydropower development.

In 1935, the FPC was transformed into an independent regulatory agency with five members nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. The FPC was authorized to regulate both hydropower and interstate electricity.

=== Natural Gas Act of 1938===
In 1938, the Natural Gas Act gave FPC jurisdiction over interstate natural gas pipelines and wholesale sales. In 1942, this jurisdiction was expanded to cover the licensing of more natural gas facilities. In 1954, the Supreme Court decision in &quot;Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Wisconsin&quot; extended FPC jurisdiction over all wellhead sales of natural gas in interstate commerce.

=== Birth of DOE; FPC Becomes FERC ===
In response to the 1973 oil crisis, Congress passed the Department of Energy Organization Act in 1977, to consolidate various energy-related agencies into a Department of Energy. Congress insisted that a separate independent regulatory body be retained, and the FPC was renamed the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), preserving its independent status within the department. Its most basic mandate was to &quot;determine whether wholesale electricity prices were unjust and unreasonable and, if so, to regulate pricing and order refunds for overcharges to ratepayers.&quot; FERC was also given added responsibility to hear appeals of DOE oil price control determinations and to conduct all &quot;on the record&quot; hearings for DOE. As a result, DOE does not have any administrative law judges. As a further protection, when the Department of Energy proposes a rule, it must refer the proposal to FERC, and FERC can take over the proceeding if FERC determines that the rulemaking &quot;may significantly affect&quot; matters in its jurisdiction. The DOE Act also transferred the regulation of interstate oil pipelines from the Interstate Commerce Commission to FERC. However, the FERC lost some jurisdiction over the imports and exports of gas and electricity.

In 1978, FERC was given additional responsibilities for harmonizing the regulation of wellhead gas sales in both the intrastate and interstate markets. FERC also administered a program to foster new cogeneration and small power production under the Public Utilities Regulatory Policy Act of 1978, which was passed as part of the National Energy Act of 1978. The National Energy Act included the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, which reduced the scope of federal price regulation, to bring greater competition to both the natural gas and electric industry.

In 1989, Congress ended federal regulation of wellhead natural gas prices, with the passage of the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act of 1989.

=== Order No. 888 ===
In 1996, FERC issued Order No. 888, which spurred the creation of regional transmission organizations in the United States. This would impact existing electric power pools by rebranding themselves as independent transmission operators. Electric utilities in some regions began to spin off their generation units as separate companies that would compete in a wholesale electric market administered by the RTOs.
Once FERC had created the framework for Regional Transmission Organizations with Order No. 888, several such RTOs were approved. The pre-existing multi-state power pool called PJM (Pennsylvania, Jersey, Maryland), the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO), and the Independent Sysoperator New England (ISO-NE) were early adopters. California, with the backing of its state and Congressional policymakers, sought approval of a controversial scheme to set up its ISO, called California ISO, based near Sacramento, CA. FERC approved it without changes because California had warned that it would not accept any changes.
Enron charged one of its policy analysts to figure out how to make the most of the flawed rules put in place for the California electricity market. Enron had success with its fraudulent market transactions.

=== Energy Policy Act of 2005 ===
In 2001, the George W. Bush administration sought to give the authority of eminent domain to FERC to circumvent state and local bureaucratic processes which often slowed the siting of new transmission projects. This expansion of power was most fiercely opposed by Bush&#x27;s own Republican party as being an expansion of federal power. Legal battles over the issue ended with the 2005 Energy Bill (Energy Policy Act of 2005) which was passed with approval of Democrats and Republicans.

The Energy Policy Act of 2005 expanded FERC&#x27;s authority to protect the reliability and cybersecurity of the bulk power system through the establishment and enforcement of mandatory standards, as well as greatly expanding FERC authority to impose civil penalties on entities that manipulate the electricity and natural gas markets. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 also gave FERC additional responsibilities and authority. Among the many provisions of the law, FERC was given what is known as &quot;backstop&quot; siting authority which allows FERC to overrule any denial of transmission projects by a state within established corridors of transmission congestion &quot;to expand transmission in limited regions of the country facing transmission constraints.&quot;

===Order No. 1000===
In 2010, FERC issued Order No. 1000, which required RTOs to create regional transmission plans and identify transmission needs based on public policy. Cost allocation reforms were included, possibly to reduce barriers faced by non incumbent transmission developers.

=== Order No. 841 ===
In February 2018, FERC issued Order No. 841, which required wholesale markets to open up to individual storage installations, regardless of interconnection point (transmission, distribution or behind-the-meter). The Order was challenged in court by the state public utility commissions via the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC), the American Public Power Association, and others who claimed that FERC overstepped its jurisdiction by regulating how local electric distribution and behind-the-meter facilities are administered, i.e., in not providing an opt out of wholesale market access for energy storage facilities located at the distribution level or behind-the-meter. A United States courts of appeals court (the D.C. Circuit) issued an order in July 2020 that upheld Order 841 and dismissed the petitioners&#x27; complaints.

=== Order No. 2222 ===
FERC issued Order No. 2222 on September 17, 2020, enabling distributed energy resources such as batteries and demand response to participate in regional wholesale electricity markets. Market operators submitted initial compliance plans by early 2022. The Supreme Court had ruled in 2016 in &quot;FERC v. Electric Power Supply Ass&#x27;n&quot; that the agency had the authority to regulate demand response transactions.

===Order No. 2023 ===
On July 28, 2023, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued Order No. 2023, which regulates the interconnection process that ties renewables projects into the large-scale grid. Among other provisions, the rule requires transmission planners to consolidate projects into &#x27;clusters&#x27; for regulatory approval purposes on a &#x27;first-ready, first-served&#x27; basis that prioritizes the most well-studied and fully financed projects, spread grid upgrade costs over multiple projects, forecast advanced technologies, and allow for multiple projects to share a new single interconnection point. It also &quot;imposes firm deadlines and penalties if transmission providers fail to complete interconnection studies on time&quot;.

On March 21, 2024, FERC issued Order No. 2023-A, an amendment clarifying certain provisions in the order, such as compliance filing requirements, the deadline for utilities to edit interconnect requests upon submission, the role of substation use in determining cost allocation, and the use of surety bonds in financing.
===Order Nos. 1920 and 1977===
On May 13, 2024, FERC issued Order Nos. 1920 and 1977. The former order requires utilities to plan 20 years in advance to anticipate future regional (though not interregional) transmission needs, with five-year updates, and to cooperate in creating a default cost-sharing plan to deliver to state regulators. It &quot;provides for cost-effective expansion of transmission that is being replaced, when needed, known as &#x27;right-sizing&#x27; transmission facilities&quot;, and it allows states more opportunities to cooperate with utility companies and energy project developers, while preventing states that benefit from regional transmission projects from not paying for them. FERC Order No. 1920-A, an amendment to it passed unanimously the following November, allows state regulators even more opportunities to provide input on interstate grid projects, adds six months to the cost allocation negotiating process, and gives utilities more leeway to forecast additional needs scenarios. 

The latter order affirms FERC&#x27;s siting authority in National Interest Electric Transmission Corridors if a state regulatory agency denies any of its own siting responsibility thereof. The order creates an Applicant Code of Conduct to encourage proper landowner outreach, and adds air quality, environmental justice and tribal engagement reports to the list of requirements for project applicants.

== Criticism ==
FERC has been subject to criticism and increasing activism by people from communities affected by its decisions approving pipeline and related projects. They contend that FERC &quot;blithely greenlights too many pipelines, export terminals and other gas infrastructure&quot; and that FERC&#x27;s structure in which it recovers its annual operating costs directly from the entities it regulates creates bias in favor of the issuance of pipeline certificates. Some of the critics have disrupted several regular open meetings of the Commission and staged a couple of week-long blockades of FERC&#x27;s headquarters in Washington, D.C., to make their points. &quot;Pipelines are facing unprecedented opposition,&quot; Commissioner LaFleur remarked to the National Press Club in a 2015 speech. &quot;We have a situation here.&quot;

FERC&#x27;s decisions in those cases are often upheld by the courts. In a July 1, 2014, decision, &quot;No Gas Pipeline v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission&quot;, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit) said that pipeline applicants are not likely to pursue many certificates that are hopeless. &quot;The fact that they generally succeed in choosing to expend their resources on applications that serve their own financial interests does not mean that an agency which recognizes merit in such applications is biased,&quot; the court said. Others have directly disputed FERC&#x27;s critics by pointing out, &quot;FERC is a creature of law. It follows a careful administrative path to regulate only a portion of natural gas such as interstate pipelines and LNG import and export terminals. That regulation includes extensive environmental review, driven by many federal laws enacted by Congress, signed by the president, and reviewed and upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court. If the agency were to adopt the path [suggested by these critics], FERC&#x27;s decisions would routinely be overturned by the federal courts.&quot;

The United States District Court for the District of Columbia also dismissed a case involving allegations of structural bias on the part of FERC. The plaintiffs contended that the Omnibus Budget Act of 1986 funding mechanism requires the commission to recover its budget through proportional charges on regulated entities, therefore making FERC biased in favor of the industry from which it gets its funding. But in an order issued March 22, 2017, the court said the plain language of the statute indicates that FERC does not have control over its own budget. &quot;The Commission&#x27;s budget cannot be increased by approving pipelines; rather, [the statute] requires the Commission to make adjustments to &#x27;eliminate any overrecovery or underrecovery.&#x27; If Plaintiffs are unhappy with Congress&#x27;s chosen appropriations to the Commission..., Plaintiffs&#x27; recourse lies with their legislative representatives.&quot;

In New Jersey, the FERC approval of the PennEast Pipeline was met with widespread criticism by environmental groups, which called the decision highly partisan. &quot;FERC has once again demonstrated its tremendous bias for, and partnership with, the pipeline industry,&quot; said Maya van Rossum, leader of the Delaware Riverkeeper Network. Doug O&#x27;Malley, president of Environment New Jersey, called the FERC approval of the pipeline a &quot;disaster.&quot; David Pringle, state campaign director of Clean Water Action and 2018 Congressional candidate, suggested the FERC was serving a partisan interest over the interests of the people of New Jersey, suggesting &quot;The FERC needs to remember it works for the people of the United States not PennEast.&quot;
These criticisms were unfounded as the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals on July 10, 2018, rejected the Delaware Riverkeeper Network and Maya Van Rossum&#x27;s claim that FERC has an incentive to award pipeline certificates because it collects its operating expenses from regulated parties. Upholding a lower court ruling, the D.C. Circuit also rejected the Delaware Riverkeeper Network&#x27;s challenge to FERC&#x27;s use of tolling orders to meet its statutory deadlines for acting on rehearing applications.

However, the D.C. Circuit has provided additional guidance concerning Commission procedures, stating that in one case FERC failed to consider the cumulative environmental impact of four projects that had been separately proposed by the same pipeline. The D.C. Circuit held that the projects were not financially independent and were &quot;a single pipeline&quot; that was &quot;linear and physically interdependent,&quot; so the cumulative environmental impacts should have been considered concurrently. In a separate decision, the D.C. Circuit later sustained the commission&#x27;s conduct of separate environmental assessments when it clarified that the &quot;critical&quot; factor was that all of the pipeline&#x27;s projects were either under construction or pending before FERC for environmental review at the same time, noting that the projects lacked temporal overlap. Furthermore, in another case, the D.C. Circuit sustained the commission&#x27;s use of a separate environmental assessment when it reasoned that the projects in dispute were &quot;unrelated&quot; and did not depend on one another for their justification. This guidance has allowed FERC to address additional claims of improper segmentation.

FERC&#x27;s leaders have stressed many times since the onset of the increased activism that the proper way to oppose a proposed new infrastructure project is by participating in the related proceeding by submitting comments and participating in public comment sessions, site visits and scoping meetings, since FERC decisions can be appealed up to the Supreme Court.

=== Federal versus state authority ===
There are regions of the country where the state public utility commission and the FERC regulated Regional Transmission Organization operate in identical footprints (such as in New York State). Where this occurs, state policy makers and FERC frequently clash as to the extent of federal power and influence within the state.

The planning and siting of public policy and renewable power plants and merchant transmission lines can be contentious, because the planning process must proceed through both entities. For example, in New York State, any large (more than 20 MW for the NYISO or 2 MW for the state Siting Committee) generation or merchant transmission facility must proceed through both the planning process of the NYISO, which operates on a two-year cycle at minimum with an inclusive class year pool of new projects evaluated simultaneously, and the siting process of the state Board on Electric Siting and the Environment. Prior to the formation of the NYISO, the planning process was determined mostly by the state siting board (although the utilities&#x27; power pool might have had its own closed door planning session) and large generation projects were developed by the utilities themselves. The dual planning process provides an opportunity for other market participants to drag out the process legally, not including the other state and/or federal environmental, trade (if an international connection with Canada is requested), and local certification and regulation processes that need to be met.

The controversy similarly applies to various electric wholesale-market issues within the RTO, when a state public utility commission asserts that its retail ratepayers (under state regulation) will be impacted by wholesale-market stakeholder decisions and reforms (under federal-level regulation). In contrast, prior to the formation of the NYISO in 1999 in New York, wholesale energy prices were set within a utility&#x27;s state rate case proceeding. Examples of contentious issues in New York include the NYISO&#x27;s development of buyer-side mitigation (price floors) in its capacity market, proxy peaking-unit specifications during the demand-curve reset (that helps set capacity market prices), the state&#x27;s granting of zero-emissions credits to wholesale-market participating nuclear power plants, and the creation of a new capacity zone amidst state and transmission owner policy initiatives.

<doc id="56978" wikidata="Q7462" url="?curid=56978" title="Song dynasty">
<text>The Song dynasty ( ) was an imperial dynasty of China that ruled from 960 to 1279. The dynasty was founded by Emperor Taizu of Song, who usurped the throne of the Later Zhou dynasty and went on to conquer the rest of the Ten Kingdoms, ending the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. The Song often came into conflict with the contemporaneous Liao, Western Xia and Jin dynasties in northern China. After retreating to southern China following attacks by the Jin dynasty, the Song was eventually conquered by the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty.

The dynasty&#x27;s history is divided into two periods: during the Northern Song (; 960–1127), the capital was in the northern city of Bianjing (now Kaifeng) and the dynasty controlled most of what is now East China. The Southern Song (; 1127–1279) comprise the period following the loss of control over the northern half of Song territory to the Jurchen-led Jin dynasty in the Jin–Song wars. At that time, the Song court retreated south of the Yangtze and established its capital at Lin&#x27;an (now Hangzhou). Although the Song dynasty had lost control of the traditional Chinese heartlands around the Yellow River, the Southern Song Empire contained a large population and productive agricultural land, sustaining a robust economy. In 1234, the Jin dynasty was conquered by the Mongols, who took control of northern China, maintaining uneasy relations with the Southern Song. Möngke Khan, the fourth Great Khan of the Mongol Empire, died in 1259 while besieging the mountain castle Diaoyucheng in Chongqing. His younger brother Kublai Khan was proclaimed the new Great Khan and in 1271 founded the Yuan dynasty. After two decades of sporadic warfare, Kublai Khan&#x27;s armies conquered the Song dynasty in 1279 after defeating the Southern Song in the Battle of Yamen, and reunited China under the Yuan dynasty.

Technology, science, philosophy, mathematics, and engineering flourished during the Song era. The Song dynasty was the first in world history to issue banknotes or true paper money and the first Chinese government to establish a permanent standing navy. This dynasty saw the first surviving records of the chemical formula for gunpowder, the invention of gunpowder weapons such as fire arrows, bombs, and the fire lance. It also saw the first discernment of true north using a compass, first recorded description of the pound lock, and improved designs of astronomical clocks. Economically, the Song dynasty was unparalleled with a gross domestic product three times larger than that of Europe during the 12th century. China&#x27;s population doubled in size between the 10th and 11th centuries. This growth was made possible by expanded rice cultivation, use of early-ripening rice from Southeast and South Asia, and production of widespread food surpluses. The Northern Song census recorded 20 million households, double that of the Han and Tang dynasties. It is estimated that the Northern Song had a population of 90 million people, and 200 million by the time of the Ming dynasty. This dramatic increase of population fomented an economic revolution in pre-modern China.

The expansion of the population, growth of cities, and emergence of a national economy led to the gradual withdrawal of the central government from direct intervention in the economy. The lower gentry assumed a larger role in local administration and affairs. Song society was vibrant, and cities had lively entertainment quarters. Citizens gathered to view and trade artwork, and intermingled at festivals and in private clubs. The spread of literature and knowledge was enhanced by the rapid expansion of woodblock printing and the 11th-century invention of movable type printing. Philosophers such as Cheng Yi and Zhu Xi reinvigorated Confucianism with new commentary, infused with Buddhist ideals, and emphasized a new organization of classic texts that established the doctrine of Neo-Confucianism. Although civil service examinations had existed since the Sui dynasty, they became much more prominent in the Song period. Officials gaining power through imperial examination led to a shift from a military-aristocratic elite to a scholar-bureaucratic elite.

== History ==

=== Northern Song, 960–1127 ===
After usurping the throne of the Later Zhou dynasty, Emperor Taizu of Song () spent sixteen years conquering the rest of China proper, reuniting much of the territory that had once belonged to the Han and Tang empires and ending the upheaval of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. In Kaifeng, he established a strong central government over the empire. The establishment of this capital marked the start of the Northern Song period. He ensured administrative stability by promoting the civil service examination system of drafting state bureaucrats by skill and merit (instead of aristocratic or military position) and promoted projects that ensured efficiency in communication throughout the empire. In one such project, cartographers created detailed maps of each province and city that were then collected in a large atlas. Emperor Taizu also promoted groundbreaking scientific and technological innovations by supporting works like the astronomical clock tower designed and built by the engineer Zhang Sixun.

The Song court maintained diplomatic relations with Chola India, the Fatimid Caliphate of Egypt, Srivijaya, the Kara-Khanid Khanate in Central Asia, the Goryeo Kingdom in Korea, and other countries that were also trade partners with Japan. Chinese records even mention an embassy from the ruler of &quot;Fu lin&quot; (拂菻, i.e. the Byzantine Empire), Michael VII Doukas, and its arrival in 1081. However, China&#x27;s closest neighbouring states had the greatest impact on its domestic and foreign policy. From its inception under Taizu, the Song dynasty alternated between warfare and diplomacy with the ethnic Khitans of the Liao dynasty in the northeast and with the Tanguts of the Western Xia in the northwest. The Song dynasty used military force in an attempt to quell the Liao dynasty and to recapture the Sixteen Prefectures, a territory under Khitan control since 938 that was traditionally considered to be part of China proper (most parts of today&#x27;s Beijing and Tianjin). Song forces were repulsed by the Liao forces, who engaged in aggressive yearly campaigns into Northern Song territory until 1005, when the signing of the Shanyuan Treaty ended these northern border clashes. The Song were forced to provide tribute to the Khitans, although this did little damage to the Song economy since the Khitans were economically dependent upon importing massive amounts of goods from the Song. More significantly, the Song state recognized the Liao state as its diplomatic equal. The Song created an extensive defensive forest along the Song–Liao border to thwart potential Khitan cavalry attacks.
The Song dynasty managed to win several military victories over the Tanguts in the early 11th century, culminating in a campaign led by the polymath scientist, general, and statesman Shen Kuo (1031–1095). However, this campaign was ultimately a failure due to a rival military officer of Shen disobeying direct orders, and the territory gained from the Western Xia was eventually lost. The Song fought against the Vietnamese kingdom of Đại Việt twice, the first conflict in 981 and later a significant war from 1075 to 1077 over a border dispute and the Song&#x27;s severing of commercial relations with Đại Việt. After the Vietnamese forces inflicted heavy damages in a raid on Guangxi, the Song commander Guo Kui (1022–1088) penetrated as far as Thăng Long (modern Hanoi). Heavy losses on both sides prompted the Vietnamese commander Thường Kiệt (1019–1105) to make peace overtures, allowing both sides to withdraw from the war effort; captured territories held by both Song and Vietnamese were mutually exchanged in 1082, along with prisoners of war.
During the 11th century, political rivalries divided members of the court due to the ministers&#x27; differing approaches, opinions, and policies regarding the handling of the Song&#x27;s complex society and thriving economy. The idealist Chancellor, Fan Zhongyan (989–1052), was the first to receive a heated political backlash when he attempted to institute the Qingli Reforms, which included measures such as improving the recruitment system of officials, increasing the salaries for minor officials, and establishing sponsorship programs to allow a wider range of people to be well educated and eligible for state service.

After Fan was forced to step down from his office, Wang Anshi (1021–1086) became Chancellor of the imperial court. With the backing of Emperor Shenzong (1067–1085), Wang Anshi severely criticized the educational system and state bureaucracy. Seeking to resolve what he saw as state corruption and negligence, Wang implemented a series of reforms called the New Policies. These involved land value tax reform, the establishment of several government monopolies, the support of local militias, and the creation of higher standards for the Imperial examination to make it more practical for men skilled in statecraft to pass.

The reforms created political factions in the court. Wang Anshi&#x27;s &quot;New Policies Group&quot; (&quot;Xin Fa&quot;), also known as the &quot;Reformers&quot;, were opposed by the ministers in the &quot;Conservative&quot; faction led by the historian and Chancellor Sima Guang (1019–1086). As one faction supplanted another in the majority position of the court ministers, it would demote rival officials and exile them to govern remote frontier regions of the empire. One of the prominent victims of the political rivalry, the famous poet and statesman Su Shi (1037–1101), was jailed and eventually exiled for criticizing Wang&#x27;s reforms.
The continual alternation between reform and conservatism had effectively weakened the dynasty. This decline can also be attributed to Cai Jing (1047–1126), who was appointed by Emperor Zhezong (1085–1100) and who remained in power until 1125. He revived the New Policies and pursued political opponents, tolerated corruption and encouraged Emperor Huizong (1100–1126) to neglect his duties to focus on artistic pursuits. Later, a peasant rebellion broke out in Zhejiang and Fujian, headed by Fang La in 1120. The rebellion may have been caused by an increasing tax burden, the concentration of landownership and oppressive government measures.

While the central Song court remained politically divided and focused upon its internal affairs, alarming new events to the north in the Liao state finally came to its attention. The Jurchen, a subject tribe of the Liao, rebelled against them and formed their own state, the Jin dynasty. The Song official Tong Guan (1054–1126) advised Emperor Huizong to form an alliance with the Jurchens, and the joint military campaign under this Alliance Conducted at Sea toppled and completely conquered the Liao dynasty by 1125. During the joint attack, the Song&#x27;s northern expedition army removed the defensive forest along the Song–Liao border.

However, the poor performance and military weakness of the Song army was observed by the Jurchens, who immediately broke the alliance, beginning the Jin–Song Wars of 1125 and 1127. Because of the removal of the previous defensive forest, the Jin army marched quickly across the North China Plain to Kaifeng. In the Jingkang Incident during the latter invasion, the Jurchens captured not only the capital, but the retired Emperor Huizong, his successor Emperor Qinzong, and most of the Imperial court.

The remaining Song forces regrouped under the self-proclaimed Emperor Gaozong (1127–1162) and withdrew south of the Yangtze to establish a new capital at Lin&#x27;an (modern Hangzhou). The Jurchen conquest of North China and shift of capitals from Kaifeng to Lin&#x27;an was the dividing line between the Northern and Southern Song dynasties.

After their fall to the Jin, the Song lost control of North China. Now occupying what has been traditionally known as &quot;China proper&quot;, the Jin regarded themselves the rightful rulers of China. The Jin later chose earth as their dynastic element and yellow as their royal color. According to the theory of the Five Elements (wuxing), the earth element follows the fire, the dynastic element of the Song, in the sequence of elemental creation. Therefore, their ideological move showed that the Jin considered Song reign in China complete, with the Jin replacing the Song as the rightful rulers of China proper.

===Southern Song, 1127–1279===
Although weakened and pushed south beyond the Huai River, the Southern Song found new ways to bolster its strong economy and defend itself against the Jin dynasty. It had able military officers such as Yue Fei and Han Shizhong. The government sponsored massive shipbuilding and harbor improvement projects, and the construction of beacons and seaport warehouses to support maritime trade abroad, including at the major international seaports, such as Quanzhou, Guangzhou, and Xiamen, that were sustaining China&#x27;s commerce.

To protect and support the multitude of ships sailing for maritime interests into the waters of the East China Sea and Yellow Sea (to Korea and Japan), Southeast Asia, the Indian Ocean, and the Red Sea, it was necessary to establish an official standing navy. The Song dynasty therefore established China&#x27;s first permanent navy in 1132, with a headquarters at Dinghai. With a permanent navy, the Song were prepared to face the naval forces of the Jin on the Yangtze River in 1161, in the Battle of Tangdao and the Battle of Caishi. During these battles the Song navy employed swift paddle wheel driven naval vessels armed with traction trebuchet catapults aboard the decks that launched gunpowder bombs. Although the Jin forces commanded by Wanyan Liang (the Prince of Hailing) boasted 70,000 men on 600 warships, and the Song forces only 3,000 men on 120 warships, the Song dynasty forces were victorious in both battles due to the destructive power of the bombs and the rapid assaults by paddlewheel ships. The strength of the navy was heavily emphasized following these victories. A century after the navy was founded it had grown in size to 52,000 fighting marines.
The Song government confiscated portions of land owned by the landed gentry in order to raise revenue for these projects, an act which caused dissension and loss of loyalty amongst leading members of Song society but did not stop the Song&#x27;s defensive preparations. Financial matters were made worse by the fact that many wealthy, land-owning families—some of which had officials working for the government—used their social connections with those in office in order to obtain tax-exempt status.

Although the Song dynasty was able to hold back the Jin, a new foe came to power over the steppe, deserts, and plains north of the Jin dynasty. The Mongols, led by Genghis Khan (r. 1206–1227), initially invaded the Jin dynasty in 1205 and 1209, engaging in large raids across its borders, and in 1211 an enormous Mongol army was assembled to invade the Jin. The Jin dynasty was forced to submit and pay tribute to the Mongols as vassals; when the Jin suddenly moved their capital city from Beijing to Kaifeng, the Mongols saw this as a revolt. Under the leadership of Ögedei Khan (r.1229–1241), both the Jin dynasty and Western Xia dynasty were conquered by Mongol forces in 1233/34.

The Mongols were allied with the Song, but this alliance was broken when the Song recaptured the former imperial capitals of Kaifeng, Luoyang, and Chang&#x27;an at the collapse of the Jin dynasty. After the first Mongol invasion of Vietnam in 1258, Mongol general Uriyangkhadai attacked Guangxi from Hanoi as part of a coordinated Mongol attack in 1259 with armies attacking in Sichuan under Mongol leader Möngke Khan and other Mongol armies attacking in modern-day Shandong and Henan. On August 11, 1259, Möngke Khan died during the siege of Diaoyu Castle in Chongqing.

His successor Kublai Khan continued the assault against the Song, gaining a temporary foothold on the southern banks of the Yangtze. By the winter of 1259, Uriyangkhadai&#x27;s army fought its way north to meet Kublai&#x27;s army, which was besieging Ezhou in Hubei. Kublai made preparations to take Ezhou, but a pending civil war with his brother Ariq Böke—a rival claimant to the Mongol Khaganate—forced Kublai to move back north with the bulk of his forces. In Kublai&#x27;s absence, the Song forces were ordered by Chancellor Jia Sidao to make an immediate assault and succeeded in pushing the Mongol forces back to the northern banks of the Yangtze. There were minor border skirmishes until 1265, when Kublai won a significant battle in Sichuan.

From 1268 to 1273, Kublai blockaded the Yangtze River with his navy and besieged Xiangyang, the last obstacle in his way to invading the rich Yangtze River basin. Kublai officially declared the creation of the Yuan dynasty in 1271. In 1275, a Song force of 130,000 troops under Chancellor Jia Sidao was defeated by Kublai&#x27;s newly appointed commander-in-chief, general Bayan. By 1276, most of the Song territory had been captured by Yuan forces, including the capital Lin&#x27;an.

In the Battle of Yamen on the Pearl River Delta in 1279, the Yuan army, led by the general Zhang Hongfan, finally crushed the Song resistance. The last remaining ruler, the 13-year-old emperor Zhao Bing, committed suicide, along with Prime Minister Lu Xiufu and 1300 members of the royal clan. On Kublai&#x27;s orders, carried out by his commander Bayan, the rest of the former imperial family of Song were unharmed; the deposed Emperor Gong was demoted, being given the title &#x27;Duke of Ying&#x27;, but was eventually exiled to Tibet where he took up a monastic life. The former emperor would eventually be forced to commit suicide under the orders of Kublai&#x27;s great-great-grandson, Gegeen Khan, out of fear that Emperor Gong would stage a coup to restore his reign. Other members of the Song imperial family continued to live in the Yuan dynasty, including Zhao Mengfu and Zhao Yong.

== Culture and society ==


The Song dynasty was an era of administrative sophistication and complex social organization. Some of the largest cities in the world were found in China during this period (Kaifeng and Hangzhou had populations of over a million). People enjoyed various social clubs and entertainment in the cities, and there were many schools and temples to provide the people with education and religious services. The Song government supported social welfare programs including the establishment of retirement homes, public clinics, and paupers&#x27; graveyards. The Song dynasty supported a widespread postal service that was modeled on the earlier Han dynasty (202 BCE – CE 220) postal system to provide swift communication throughout the empire. The central government employed thousands of postal workers of various ranks to provide service for post offices and larger postal stations. In rural areas, farming peasants either owned their own plots of land, paid rents as tenant farmers, or were serfs on large estates.


Although women were on a lower social tier than men according to Confucian ethics, they enjoyed many social and legal privileges and wielded considerable power at home and in their own small businesses. As Song society became more and more prosperous and parents on the bride&#x27;s side of the family provided larger dowries for her marriage, women naturally gained many new legal rights in ownership of property. Under certain circumstances, an unmarried daughter without brothers, or a surviving mother without sons, could inherit one-half of her father&#x27;s share of undivided family property. There were many notable and well-educated women, and it was a common practice for women to educate their sons during their earliest youth. The mother of the scientist, general, diplomat, and statesman Shen Kuo taught him essentials of military strategy. There were also exceptional women writers and poets, such as Li Qingzhao (1084–1151), who became famous even in her lifetime.

Religion in China during this period had a great effect on people&#x27;s lives, beliefs, and daily activities, and Chinese literature on spirituality was popular. The major deities of Daoism and Buddhism, ancestral spirits, and the many deities of Chinese folk religion were worshipped with sacrificial offerings. Tansen Sen asserts that more Buddhist monks from India traveled to China during the Song than in the previous Tang dynasty (618–907). With many ethnic foreigners travelling to China to conduct trade or live permanently, there came many foreign religions; religious minorities in China included Middle Eastern Muslims, the Kaifeng Jews, and Persian Manichaeans.

The populace engaged in a vibrant social and domestic life, enjoying such public festivals as the Lantern Festival and the Qingming Festival. There were entertainment quarters in the cities providing a constant array of amusements. There were puppeteers, acrobats, theatre actors, sword swallowers, snake charmers, storytellers, singers and musicians, prostitutes, and places to relax, including tea houses, restaurants, and organized banquets. People attended social clubs in large numbers; there were tea clubs, exotic food clubs, antiquarian and art collectors&#x27; clubs, horse-loving clubs, poetry clubs, and music clubs. Like regional cooking and cuisines in the Song, the era was known for its regional varieties of performing arts styles as well. Theatrical drama was very popular amongst the elite and general populace, although Classical Chinese—not the vernacular language—was spoken by actors on stage. The four largest drama theatres in Kaifeng could hold audiences of several thousand each. There were also notable domestic pastimes, as people at home enjoyed activities such as the go and xiangqi board games.

=== Civil service examinations and the gentry ===

During this period greater emphasis was laid upon the civil service system of recruiting officials; this was based upon degrees acquired through competitive examinations, in an effort to select the most capable individuals for governance. Selecting men for office through proven merit was an ancient idea in China. The civil service system became institutionalized on a small scale during the Sui and Tang dynasties, but by the Song period, it became virtually the only means for drafting officials into the government. The advent of widespread printing helped to widely circulate Confucian teachings and to educate more and more eligible candidates for the exams. This can be seen in the number of exam takers for the low-level prefectural exams rising from 30,000 annual candidates in the early 11th century to 400,000 candidates by the late 13th century. The civil service and examination system allowed for greater meritocracy, social mobility, and equality in competition for those wishing to attain an official seat in government. Using statistics gathered by the Song state, Edward A. Kracke, Sudō Yoshiyuki, and Ho Ping-ti supported the hypothesis that simply having a father, grandfather, or great-grandfather who had served as an official of state did not guarantee one would obtain the same level of authority. Robert Hartwell and Robert P. Hymes criticized this model, stating that it places too much emphasis on the role of the nuclear family and considers only three paternal ascendants of exam candidates while ignoring the demographic reality of Song China, the significant proportion of males in each generation that had no surviving sons, and the role of the extended family. Many felt disenfranchised by what they saw as a bureaucratic system that favored the land-holding class able to afford the best education. One of the greatest literary critics of this was the official and famous poet Su Shi. Yet Su was a product of his times, as the identity, habits, and attitudes of the scholar-official had become less aristocratic and more bureaucratic with the transition of the periods from Tang to Song. At the beginning of the dynasty, government posts were disproportionately held by two elite social groups: a founding elite who had ties with the founding emperor and a semi-hereditary professional elite who used long-held clan status, family connections, and marriage alliances to secure appointments. By the late 11th century, the founding elite became obsolete, while political partisanship and factionalism at court undermined the marriage strategies of the professional elite, which dissolved as a distinguishable social group and was replaced by a multitude of gentry families.
Due to Song&#x27;s enormous population growth and the body of its appointed scholar-officials being accepted in limited numbers (about 20,000 active officials during the Song period), the larger scholarly gentry class would now take over grassroots affairs on the vast local level. Excluding the scholar-officials in office, this elite social class consisted of exam candidates, examination degree-holders not yet assigned to an official post, local tutors, and retired officials. These learned men, degree-holders, and local elites supervised local affairs and sponsored necessary facilities of local communities; any local magistrate appointed to his office by the government relied upon the cooperation of the few or many local gentry in the area. For example, the Song government—excluding the educational-reformist government under Emperor Huizong—spared little amount of state revenue to maintain prefectural and county schools; instead, the bulk of the funds for schools was drawn from private financing. This limited role of government officials was a departure from the earlier Tang dynasty (618–907), when the government strictly regulated commercial markets and local affairs; now the government withdrew heavily from regulating commerce and relied upon a mass of local gentry to perform necessary duties in their communities.

The gentry distinguished themselves in society through their intellectual and antiquarian pursuits, while the homes of prominent landholders attracted a variety of courtiers, including artisans, artists, educational tutors, and entertainers. Despite the disdain for trade, commerce, and the merchant class exhibited by the highly cultured and elite exam-drafted scholar-officials, commercialism played a prominent role in Song culture and society. A scholar-official would be frowned upon by his peers if he pursued means of profiteering outside of his official salary; however, this did not stop many scholar-officials from managing business relations through the use of intermediary agents.

=== Law, justice, and forensic science ===

The Song judicial system retained most of the legal code of the earlier Tang dynasty, the basis of traditional Chinese law up until the modern era. Roving sheriffs maintained law and order in the municipal jurisdictions and occasionally ventured into the countryside. Official magistrates overseeing court cases were not only expected to be well-versed in written law but also to promote morality in society. Magistrates such as the famed Bao Zheng (999–1062) embodied the upright, moral judge who upheld justice and never failed to live up to his principles. Song judges specified the guilty person or party in a criminal act and meted out punishments accordingly, often in the form of caning. A guilty individual or parties brought to court for a criminal or civil offense were not viewed as wholly innocent until proven otherwise, while even accusers were viewed with a high level of suspicion by the judge. Due to costly court expenses and immediate jailing of those accused of criminal offenses, people in the Song preferred to settle disputes and quarrels privately, without the court&#x27;s interference.

Shen Kuo&#x27;s &quot;Dream Pool Essays&quot; argued against traditional Chinese beliefs in anatomy (such as his argument for two throat valves instead of three); this perhaps spurred the interest in the performance of post-mortem autopsies in China during the 12th century. The physician and judge known as Song Ci (1186–1249) wrote a pioneering work of forensic science on the examination of corpses in order to determine cause of death (strangulation, poisoning, drowning, blows, etc.) and to prove whether death resulted from murder, suicide, or accidental death. Song Ci stressed the importance of proper coroner&#x27;s conduct during autopsies and the accurate recording of the inquest of each autopsy by official clerks.

=== Military and methods of warfare ===


The Song military was chiefly organized to ensure that the army could not threaten Imperial control, often at the expense of effectiveness in war. Northern Song&#x27;s Military Council operated under a Chancellor, who had no control over the imperial army. The imperial army was divided among three marshals, each independently responsible to the Emperor. Since the Emperor rarely led campaigns personally, Song forces lacked unity of command. The imperial court often believed that successful generals endangered royal authority, and relieved or even executed them (notably Li Gang, Yue Fei, and Han Shizhong).
Although the scholar-officials viewed military soldiers as lower members in the hierarchic social order, a person could gain status and prestige in society by becoming a high-ranking military officer with a record of victorious battles. At its height, the Song military had one million soldiers divided into platoons of 50 troops, companies made of two platoons, battalions composed of 500 soldiers. Crossbowmen were separated from the regular infantry and placed in their own units as they were prized combatants, providing effective missile fire against cavalry charges. The government was eager to sponsor new crossbow designs that could shoot at longer ranges, while crossbowmen were also valuable when employed as long-range snipers. Song cavalry employed a slew of different weapons, including halberds, swords, bows, spears, and &#x27;fire lances&#x27; that discharged a gunpowder blast of flame and shrapnel.

Military strategy and military training were treated as sciences that could be studied and perfected; soldiers were tested in their skills of using weaponry and in their athletic ability. The troops were trained to follow signal standards to advance at the waving of banners and to halt at the sound of bells and drums.

The Song navy was of great importance during the consolidation of the empire in the 10th century; during the war against the Southern Tang state, the Song navy employed tactics such as defending large floating pontoon bridges across the Yangtze River in order to secure movements of troops and supplies. There were large ships in the Song navy that could carry 1,000 soldiers aboard their decks, while the swift-moving paddle-wheel craft were viewed as essential fighting ships in any successful naval battle.

In a battle on January 23, 971, massive arrow fire from Song dynasty crossbowmen decimated the war elephant corps of the Southern Han army. This defeat not only marked the eventual submission of the Southern Han to the Song dynasty, but also the last instance where a war elephant corps was employed as a regular division within a Chinese army.

There was a total of 347 military treatises written during the Song period, as listed by the history text of the &quot;Song Shi&quot; (compiled in 1345). However, only a handful of these military treatises have survived, which includes the &quot;Wujing Zongyao&quot; written in 1044. It was the first known book to have listed formulas for gunpowder; it gave appropriate formulas for use in several different kinds of gunpowder bombs. It also provided detailed descriptions and illustrations of double-piston pump flamethrowers, as well as instructions for the maintenance and repair of the components and equipment used in the device.

=== Arts, literature, philosophy, and religion ===

The visual arts during the Song dynasty were heightened by new developments such as advances in landscape and portrait painting. The gentry elite engaged in the arts as accepted pastimes of the cultured scholar-official, including painting, composing poetry, and writing calligraphy. The poet and statesman Su Shi and his associate Mi Fu (1051–1107) enjoyed antiquarian affairs, often borrowing or buying art pieces to study and copy. Poetry and literature profited from the rising popularity and development of the ci poetry form. Enormous encyclopedic volumes were compiled, such as works of historiography and dozens of treatises on technical subjects. This included the universal history text of the &quot;Zizhi Tongjian&quot;, compiled into 1000 volumes of 9.4 million written Chinese characters. The genre of Chinese travel literature also became popular with the writings of the geographer Fan Chengda (1126–1193) and Su Shi, the latter of whom wrote the &#x27;daytrip essay&#x27; known as &quot;Record of Stone Bell Mountain&quot; that used persuasive writing to argue for a philosophical point. Although an early form of the local geographic gazetteer existed in China since the 1st century, the matured form known as &quot;treatise on a place&quot;, or &quot;fangzhi&quot;, replaced the old &quot;map guide&quot;, or , during the Song dynasty.

The imperial courts of the emperor&#x27;s palace were filled with his entourage of court painters, calligraphers, poets, and storytellers. Emperor Huizong was the eighth emperor of the Song dynasty and he was a renowned artist as well as a patron of the art and the catalogue of his collection listed over 6,000 known paintings. A prime example of a highly venerated court painter was Zhang Zeduan (1085–1145) who painted an enormous panoramic painting, &quot;Along the River During the Qingming Festival&quot;. Emperor Gaozong of Song initiated a massive art project during his reign, known as the &quot;Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute&quot; from the life story of Cai Wenji (b. 177). This art project was a diplomatic gesture to the Jin dynasty while he negotiated for the release of his mother from Jurchen captivity in the north.

In philosophy, Chinese Buddhism had waned in influence but it retained its hold on the arts and on the charities of monasteries. Buddhism had a profound influence upon the budding movement of Neo-Confucianism, led by Cheng Yi (1033–1107) and Zhu Xi (1130–1200). Mahayana Buddhism influenced Fan Zhongyan and Wang Anshi through its concept of ethical universalism, while Buddhist metaphysics deeply affected the pre–Neo-Confucian doctrine of Cheng Yi. The philosophical work of Cheng Yi in turn influenced Zhu Xi. Although his writings were not accepted by his contemporary peers, Zhu&#x27;s commentary and emphasis upon the Confucian classics of the Four Books as an introductory corpus to Confucian learning formed the basis of the Neo-Confucian doctrine. By the year 1241, under the sponsorship of Emperor Lizong, Zhu Xi&#x27;s Four Books and his commentary on them became standard requirements of study for students attempting to pass the civil service examinations. The neighbouring countries of Japan and Korea also adopted Zhu Xi&#x27;s teaching, known as the Shushigaku (朱子學, School of Zhu Xi) of Japan, and in Korea the Jujahak (주자학). Buddhism&#x27;s continuing influence can be seen in painted artwork such as Lin Tinggui&#x27;s &quot;Luohan Laundering&quot;. However, the ideology was highly criticized and even scorned by some. The statesman and historian Ouyang Xiu (1007–1072) called the religion a &quot;curse&quot; that could only be remedied by uprooting it from Chinese culture and replacing it with Confucian discourse. The Chan sect experienced a literary flourishing in the Song period, which saw the publication of several major classical koan collections which remain influential in Zen philosophy and practice to the present day. A true revival of Buddhism in Chinese society would not occur until the Mongol rule of the Yuan dynasty, with Kublai Khan&#x27;s sponsorship of Tibetan Buddhism and Drogön Chögyal Phagpa as the leading lama. The Christian sect of Nestorianism, which had entered China in the Tang era, would also be revived in China under Mongol rule.

=== Cuisine and clothing ===
Sumptuary laws regulated the food that one consumed and the clothes that one wore according to status and social class. Clothing was made of hemp or cotton cloths, restricted to a color standard of black and white. Trousers were the acceptable attire for peasants, soldiers, artisans, and merchants, although wealthy merchants might choose to wear more ornate clothing and male blouses that came down below the waist. Acceptable apparel for scholar-officials was rigidly defined by the social ranking system. However, as time went on this rule of rank-graded apparel for officials was not as strictly enforced. Each official was able to display his awarded status by wearing different-colored traditional silken robes that hung to the ground around his feet, specific types of headgear, and even specific styles of girdles that displayed his graded-rank of officialdom.

Women wore long dresses, blouses that came down to the knee, skirts, and jackets with long or short sleeves, while women from wealthy families could wear purple scarves around their shoulders. The main difference in women&#x27;s apparel from that of men was that it was fastened on the left, not on the right.

The main food staples in the diet of the lower classes remained rice, pork, and salted fish. In 1011, Emperor Zhenzong of Song introduced Champa rice to China from Vietnam&#x27;s Kingdom of Champa, which sent 30,000 bushels as a tribute to Song. Champa rice was drought-resistant and able to grow fast enough to offer two harvests a year instead of one.

Song restaurant and tavern menus are recorded. They list entrees for feasts, banquets, festivals, and carnivals. They reveal a diverse and lavish diet for those of the upper class. They could choose from a wide variety of meats and seafood, including shrimp, geese, duck, mussel, shellfish, fallow deer, hare, partridge, pheasant, francolin, quail, fox, badger, clam, crab, and many others. Dairy products were rare in Chinese cuisine at this time. Beef was rarely consumed since the bull was a valuable draft animal, and dog meat was absent from the diet of the wealthy, although the poor could choose to eat dog meat if necessary (yet it was not part of their regular diet). People also consumed dates, raisins, jujubes, pears, plums, apricots, pear juice, lychee-fruit juice, honey and ginger drinks, spices and seasonings of Sichuan pepper, ginger, soy sauce, vegetable oil, sesame oil, salt, and vinegar.

== Economy==


The Song dynasty had one of the most prosperous and advanced economies in the medieval world. Song Chinese invested their funds in joint stock companies and in multiple sailing vessels at a time when monetary gain was assured from the vigorous overseas trade and domestic trade along the Grand Canal and Yangtze River. Both private and government-controlled industries met the needs of a growing Chinese population in the Song; prominent merchant families and private businesses were allowed to occupy industries that were not already government-operated monopolies. Economic historians emphasize this toleration of market mechanisms over population growth or new farming technologies as the major cause of Song economic prosperity. Artisans and merchants formed guilds that the state had to deal with when assessing taxes, requisitioning goods, and setting standard workers&#x27; wages and prices on goods.

The iron industry was pursued by both private entrepreneurs who owned their own smelters as well as government-supervised smelting facilities. The Song economy was stable enough to produce over of iron products per year. Large-scale Deforestation in China would have continued if not for the 11th-century innovation of the use of coal instead of charcoal in blast furnaces for smelting cast iron. Much of this iron was reserved for military use in crafting weapons and armouring troops, but some was used to fashion the many iron products needed to fill the demands of the growing domestic market. The iron trade within China was advanced by the construction of new canals, facilitating the flow of iron products from production centres to the large market in the capital city.

The annual output of minted copper currency in 1085 reached roughly six billion coins. The most notable advancement in the Song economy was the establishment of the world&#x27;s first government issued paper-printed money, known as Jiaozi (see also &quot;Huizi&quot;). For the printing of paper money, the Song court established several government-run factories in the cities of Huizhou, Chengdu, Hangzhou, and Anqi. The size of the workforce employed in paper money factories was large; it was recorded in 1175 that the factory at Hangzhou employed more than a thousand workers a day.

The economic power of Song China can be attested by the growth of the urban population of its capital city Hangzhou. The population was 200,000 at the start of the 12th century and increased to 500,000 around 1170 and doubled to over a million a century later. This economic power also heavily influenced foreign economies abroad. In 1120 alone, the Song government collected 18,000,000 ounces (510,000 kg) of silver in taxes. The Moroccan geographer al-Idrisi wrote in 1154 of the prowess of Chinese merchant ships in the Indian Ocean and of their annual voyages that brought iron, swords, silk, velvet, porcelain, and various textiles to places such as Aden (Yemen), the Indus River, and the Euphrates. Foreigners, in turn, affected the Chinese economy. For example, many West and Central Asian Muslims went to China to trade, becoming a preeminent force in the import and export industry, while some were even appointed as officers supervising economic affairs. Sea trade with the South-west Pacific, the Hindu world, the Islamic world, and East Africa brought merchants great fortune and spurred an enormous growth in the shipbuilding industry of Song-era Fujian. However, there was risk involved in such long overseas ventures. In order to reduce the risk of losing money on maritime trade missions abroad, wrote historians Ebrey, Walthall, and Palais:

== Science and technology ==

=== Gunpowder warfare ===


Advancements in weapons technology enhanced by gunpowder, including the evolution of the early flamethrower, explosive grenades, firearms, cannons, and land mines, enabled the Song Chinese to ward off their militant enemies until the Song&#x27;s ultimate collapse in the late 13th century. The &quot;Wujing Zongyao&quot; manuscript of 1044 was the first book in history to provide formulas for gunpowder and their specified use in different types of bombs. While engaged in a war with the Mongols, in 1259 the official Li Zengbo wrote in his &quot;Kezhai Zagao, Xugaohou&quot; that the city of Qingzhou was manufacturing one to two thousand strong iron-cased bombshells a month, dispatching to Xiangyang and Yingzhou about ten to twenty thousand such bombs at a time. In turn, the invading Mongols employed northern Chinese soldiers and used these same types of gunpowder weapons against the Song. By the 14th century the firearm and cannon could also be found in Europe, India, and the Middle East, during the early age of gunpowder warfare.

=== Measuring distance and mechanical navigation ===
As early as the Han dynasty, when the state needed to accurately measure distances traveled throughout the empire, the Chinese relied on a mechanical odometer. The Chinese odometer was a wheeled carriage, its gearwork being driven by the rotation of the carriage&#x27;s wheels; specific units of distance—the Chinese li—were marked by the mechanical striking of a drum or bell as an auditory signal. The specifications for the 11th-century odometer were written by Chief Chamberlain Lu Daolong, who is quoted extensively in the historical text of the &quot;Song Shi&quot; (compiled by 1345). In the Song period, the odometer vehicle was also combined with another old complex mechanical device known as the south-pointing chariot. This device, originally crafted by Ma Jun in the 3rd century, incorporated a differential gear that allowed a figure mounted on the vehicle to always point in the southern direction, no matter how the vehicle&#x27;s wheels turned about. The concept of the differential gear that was used in this navigational vehicle is now found in modern automobiles in order to apply an equal amount of torque to a car&#x27;s wheels even when they are rotating at different speeds.

=== Polymaths, inventions, and astronomy ===


Polymaths such as the scientists and statesmen Shen Kuo (1031–1095) and Su Song (1020–1101) embodied advancements in all fields of study, including botany, zoology, geology, mineralogy, metallurgy, mechanics, magnetics, meteorology, horology, astronomy, pharmaceutical medicine, archeology, mathematics, cartography, optics, art criticism, hydraulics, and many other fields.

Shen Kuo was the first to discern magnetic declination of true north while experimenting with a compass. Shen theorized that geographical climates gradually shifted over time. He created a theory of land formation involving concepts accepted in modern geomorphology. He performed optical experiments with camera obscura just decades after Ibn al-Haytham was the first to do so. He also improved the designs of astronomical instruments such as the widened astronomical sighting tube, which allowed Shen Kuo to fix the position of the pole star (which had shifted over centuries of time). Shen Kuo was also known for hydraulic clockworks, as he invented a new overflow-tank clepsydra which had more efficient higher-order interpolation instead of linear interpolation in calibrating the measure of time.

Su Song was best known for his horology treatise written in 1092, which described and illustrated in great detail his hydraulic-powered, tall astronomical clock tower built in Kaifeng. The clock tower featured large astronomical instruments of the armillary sphere and celestial globe, both driven by an early intermittently working escapement mechanism (similarly to the western verge escapement of true mechanical clocks appeared in medieval clockworks, derived from ancient clockworks of classical times). Su&#x27;s tower featured a rotating gear wheel with 133 clock jack mannequins who were timed to rotate past shuttered windows while ringing gongs and bells, banging drums, and presenting announcement plaques. In his printed book, Su published a celestial atlas of five star charts. These star charts feature a cylindrical projection similar to Mercator projection, the latter being a cartographic innovation of Gerardus Mercator in 1569.

The Song Chinese observed supernovae, including SN 1054, the remnants of which would form the Crab Nebula. Moreover, the &quot;Soochow Astronomical Chart&quot; on Chinese planispheres was prepared in 1193 for instructing the crown prince on astronomical findings. The planispheres were engraved in stone several decades later.

=== Mathematics and cartography ===


There were many notable improvements to Chinese mathematics during the Song era. Mathematician Yang Hui&#x27;s 1261 book provided the earliest Chinese illustration of Pascal&#x27;s triangle, although it had earlier been described by Jia Xian in around 1100. Yang Hui also provided rules for constructing combinatorial arrangements in magic squares, provided theoretical proof for Euclid&#x27;s forty-third proposition about parallelograms, and was the first to use negative coefficients of &#x27;x&#x27; in quadratic equations. Yang&#x27;s contemporary Qin Jiushao (–1261) was the first to introduce the zero symbol into Chinese mathematics; before this blank spaces were used instead of zeroes in the system of counting rods. He is also known for working with the Chinese remainder theorem, Heron&#x27;s formula, and astronomical data used in determining the winter solstice. Qin&#x27;s major work was the &quot;Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections&quot; published in 1247.

Geometry was essential to surveying and cartography. The earliest extant Chinese maps date to the 4th century BCE, yet it was not until the time of Pei Xiu (224–271) that topographical elevation, a formal rectangular grid system, and use of a standard graduated scale of distances was applied to terrain maps. Following a long tradition, Shen Kuo created a raised-relief map, while his other maps featured a uniform graduated scale of 1:900,000. A squared map of 1137—carved into a stone block—followed a uniform grid scale of 100 li for each gridded square, and accurately mapped the outline of the coasts and river systems of China, extending all the way to India. Furthermore, the world&#x27;s oldest known terrain map in printed form comes from the edited encyclopedia of Yang Jia in 1155, which displayed western China without the formal grid system that was characteristic of more professionally made Chinese maps. Although gazetteers had existed since 52 CE during the Han dynasty and gazetteers accompanied by illustrative maps (Chinese: ) since the Sui dynasty, the illustrated gazetteer became much more common during the Song dynasty, when the foremost concern was for illustrative gazetteers to serve political, administrative, and military purposes.

=== Movable type printing ===
The innovation of movable type printing was made by the artisan Bi Sheng (990–1051), first described by the scientist and statesman Shen Kuo in his &quot;Dream Pool Essays&quot; of 1088. The collection of Bi Sheng&#x27;s original clay-fired typeface was passed on to one of Shen Kuo&#x27;s nephews, and was carefully preserved. Movable type enhanced the already widespread use of woodblock methods of printing thousands of documents and volumes of written literature, consumed eagerly by an increasingly literate public. The advancement of printing deeply affected education and the scholar-official class, since more books could be made faster while mass-produced, printed books were cheaper in comparison to laborious handwritten copies. The enhancement of widespread printing and print culture in the Song period was thus a direct catalyst in the rise of social mobility and expansion of the educated class of scholar elites, the latter which expanded dramatically in size from the 11th to 13th centuries.

The movable type invented by Bi Sheng was ultimately trumped by the use of woodblock printing due to the limitations of Chinese characters, yet movable type printing continued to be used and was improved in later periods. The Yuan scholar-official Wang Zhen () implemented a faster typesetting process, improved Bi&#x27;s baked-clay movable type character set with a wooden one, and experimented with tin-metal movable type. The wealthy printing patron Hua Sui (1439–1513) of the Ming dynasty established China&#x27;s first metal movable type (using bronze) in 1490. In 1638, the &quot;Peking Gazette&quot; switched their printing process from woodblock to movable type printing. Yet it was during the Qing dynasty that massive printing projects began to employ movable type printing. This includes the printing of sixty-six copies of a 5,020 volume long encyclopedia in 1725, the &quot;Complete Classics Collection of Ancient China&quot;, which necessitated the crafting of 250,000 movable type characters cast in bronze. By the 19th century the European style printing press replaced the old Chinese methods of movable type, while traditional woodblock printing in modern East Asia is used sparsely and for aesthetic reasons.

=== Hydraulic and nautical engineering ===

The most important nautical innovation of the Song period seems to have been the introduction of the magnetic mariner&#x27;s compass, which permitted accurate navigation on the open sea regardless of the weather. The magnetized compass needle known in Chinese as the &quot;south-pointing needle&quot; was first described by Shen Kuo in his 1088 &quot;Dream Pool Essays&quot; and first mentioned in active use by sailors in Zhu Yu&#x27;s 1119 &quot;Pingzhou Table Talks&quot;.
There were other considerable advancements in hydraulic engineering and nautical technology during the Song dynasty. The 10th-century invention of the pound lock for canal systems allowed different water levels to be raised and lowered for separated segments of a canal, which significantly aided the safety of canal traffic and allowed for larger barges. There was the Song-era innovation of watertight bulkhead compartments that allowed damage to hulls without sinking the ships. If ships were damaged, the Chinese of the 11th century employed drydocks to repair them while suspended out of the water. The Song used crossbeams to brace the ribs of ships in order to strengthen them in a skeletal-like structure. Stern-mounted rudders had been mounted on Chinese ships since the 1st century, as evidenced by a preserved Han tomb model of a ship. In the Song period, the Chinese devised a way to mechanically raise and lower rudders in order for ships to travel in a wider range of water depths. The Song arranged the protruding teeth of anchors in a circular pattern instead of in one direction. David Graff and Robin Higham state that this arrangement &quot;[made] them more reliable&quot; for anchoring ships.

=== Structural engineering and architecture ===


Architecture during the Song period reached new heights of sophistication. Authors such as Yu Hao and Shen Kuo wrote books outlining the field of architectural layouts, craftsmanship, and structural engineering in the 10th and 11th centuries, respectively. Shen Kuo preserved the written dialogues of Yu Hao when describing technical issues such as slanting struts built into pagoda towers for diagonal wind bracing. Shen Kuo also preserved Yu&#x27;s specified dimensions and units of measurement for various building types. The architect Li Jie (1065–1110), who published the &quot;Yingzao Fashi&quot; (&#x27;Treatise on Architectural Methods&#x27;) in 1103, greatly expanded upon the works of Yu Hao and compiled the standard building codes used by the central government agencies and by craftsmen throughout the empire. He addressed the standard methods of construction, design, and applications of moats and fortifications, stonework, greater woodwork, lesser woodwork, wood-carving, turning and drilling, sawing, bamboo work, tiling, wall building, painting and decoration, brickwork, glazed tile making, and provided proportions for mortar formulas in masonry. In his book, Li provided detailed and vivid illustrations of architectural components and cross-sections of buildings. These illustrations displayed various applications of corbel brackets, cantilever arms, mortise and tenon work of tie beams and cross beams, and diagrams showing the various building types of halls in graded sizes. He also outlined the standard units of measurement and standard dimensional measurements of all building components described and illustrated in his book.

Grandiose building projects were supported by the government, including the erection of towering Buddhist Chinese pagodas and the construction of enormous bridges (wood or stone, trestle or segmental arch bridge). Many of the pagoda towers built during the Song period were erected at heights that exceeded ten stories. Some of the most famous are the Iron Pagoda built in 1049 during the Northern Song and the Liuhe Pagoda built in 1165 during the Southern Song, though there were others. The tallest is the Liaodi Pagoda built in 1055 in Hebei, towering in total height. Some of the bridges reached lengths of , with many being wide enough to allow two lanes of cart traffic simultaneously over a waterway or ravine. The government also oversaw construction of their own administrative offices, palace apartments, city fortifications, ancestral temples, and Buddhist temples.

The professions of the architect, craftsman, carpenter, and structural engineer were not seen as professionally equal to that of a Confucian scholar-official. Architectural knowledge had been passed down orally for thousands of years in China, in many cases from a father craftsman to his son. Structural engineering and architecture schools were known to have existed during the Song period; one prestigious engineering school was headed by the renowned bridge-builder Cai Xiang (1012–1067) in medieval Fujian province.

Besides existing buildings and technical literature of building manuals, Song dynasty artwork portraying cityscapes and other buildings aid modern-day scholars in their attempts to reconstruct and realize the nuances of Song architecture. Song dynasty artists such as Li Cheng, Fan Kuan, Guo Xi, Zhang Zeduan, Emperor Huizong of Song, and Ma Lin painted close-up depictions of buildings as well as large expanses of cityscapes featuring arched bridges, halls and pavilions, pagoda towers, and distinct Chinese city walls. The scientist and statesman Shen Kuo was known for his criticism relating to architecture, saying that it was more important for an artist to capture a holistic view of a landscape than it was to focus on the angles and corners of buildings. For example, Shen criticized the work of the painter Li Cheng for failing to observe the principle of &quot;seeing the small from the viewpoint of the large&quot; in portraying buildings.

There were also pyramidal tomb structures in the Song era, such as the Song imperial tombs located in Gongxian, Henan. About from Gongxian is another Song dynasty tomb at Baisha, which features &quot;elaborate facsimiles in brick of Chinese timber frame construction, from door lintels to pillars and pedestals to bracket sets, that adorn interior walls.&quot; The two large chambers of the Baisha tomb also feature conical-shaped roofs. Flanking the avenues leading to these tombs are lines of Song dynasty stone statues of officials, tomb guardians, animals, and legendary creatures.

=== Archaeology ===

In addition to the Song gentry&#x27;s antiquarian pursuits of art collecting, scholar-officials during the Song became highly interested in retrieving ancient relics from archaeological sites, in order to revive the use of ancient vessels in ceremonies of state ritual. Scholar-officials of the Song period claimed to have discovered ancient bronze vessels that were created as far back as the Shang dynasty (1600–1046 BCE), which bore the oracle bone script of the Shang era. Some attempted to recreate these bronze vessels by using imagination alone, not by observing tangible evidence of relics; this practice was criticized by Shen Kuo in his work of 1088. Yet Shen Kuo had much more to criticize than this practice alone. Shen objected to the idea of his peers that ancient relics were products created by famous &quot;sages&quot; in lore or the ancient aristocratic class; Shen rightfully attributed the discovered handicrafts and vessels from ancient times as the work of artisans and commoners from previous eras. He also disapproved of his peers&#x27; pursuit of archaeology simply to enhance state ritual, since Shen not only took an interdisciplinary approach with the study of archaeology, but he also emphasized the study of functionality and investigating what was the ancient relics&#x27; original processes of manufacture. Shen used ancient texts and existing models of armillary spheres to create one based on ancient standards; Shen described ancient weaponry such as the use of a scaled sighting device on crossbows; while experimenting with ancient musical measures, Shen suggested hanging an ancient bell by using a hollow handle.

Despite the gentry&#x27;s overriding interest in archaeology simply for reviving ancient state rituals, some of Shen&#x27;s peers took a similar approach to the study of archaeology. His contemporary Ouyang Xiu (1007–1072) compiled an analytical catalogue of ancient rubbings on stone and bronze which pioneered ideas in early epigraphy and archaeology. During the 11th century, Song scholars discovered the ancient shrine of Wu Liang (78–151 CE), a scholar of the Han dynasty; they produced rubbings of the carvings and bas-reliefs decorating the walls of his tomb so that they could be analyzed elsewhere. On the unreliability of historical works written after the fact, the epigrapher and poet Zhao Mingcheng (1081–1129) stated &quot;... the inscriptions on stone and bronze are made at the time the events took place and can be trusted without reservation, and thus discrepancies may be discovered.&quot; Historian R.C. Rudolph states that Zhao&#x27;s emphasis on consulting contemporary sources for accurate dating is parallel with the concern of the German historian Leopold von Ranke (1795–1886), and was in fact emphasized by many Song scholars. The Song scholar Hong Mai (1123–1202) heavily criticized what he called the court&#x27;s &quot;ridiculous&quot; archaeological catalogue &quot;Bogutu&quot; compiled during the Huizong reign periods of Zheng He and Xuan He (1111–1125). Hong Mai obtained old vessels from the Han dynasty and compared them with the descriptions offered in the catalogue, which he found so inaccurate he stated he had to &quot;hold my sides with laughter.&quot; Hong Mai pointed out that the erroneous material was the fault of Chancellor Cai Jing, who prohibited scholars from reading and consulting written histories.

<doc id="56979" wikidata="Q1427630" url="?curid=56979" title="Battle of Adrianople (1205)">
<text>The Battle of Adrianople occurred around Adrianople on April 14, 1205, between Bulgarians and Cumans under Tsar Kaloyan of Bulgaria, and Crusaders under Baldwin I, who only months before had been crowned Emperor of Constantinople, allied with Venetians under Doge Enrico Dandolo. The battle was won by the Bulgarian Empire after a successful ambush.

== Background ==
In 1204, financial difficulties led the armies of the Fourth Crusade to deviate from their intended goal of Jerusalem. Instead, they captured and sacked Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire. The Byzantine government was driven out of the city, and a Latin Empire established in its place. At first this new power controlled only the environs of Constantinople and the province of Thrace, but eventually it expanded into Bithynia, Thessaly and central and southern Greece.

Around the same time, Tsar Kaloyan, the Tsar of Bulgaria, successfully completed negotiations with Pope Innocent III. The Bulgarian ruler was recognized as &quot;rex&quot;, i.e. emperor (tsar), while the Bulgarian archbishop regained the title &quot;primas&quot;, equal to that of patriarch. This might have made for good relations between Tsar Kaloyan and the new Western European conquerors, but immediately after settling in Constantinopole the Latins stated their pretensions on Bulgarian lands. Knights began crossing the border to pillage Bulgarian towns and villages. These belligerent actions convinced the Bulgarian Emperor to abandon the prospect of a Latin alliance, turning instead to the Greeks in the unconquered regions of Thrace. In the winter of 1204-1205 messengers of the local Greek aristocracy visited Kaloyan and an alliance was formed.

In the spring of 1205, Didymoteicho and Adrianople revolted, followed soon after by the entirety of Thrace. Emperor Baldwin I marched his army north and reached Adrianople by the end of March.

== Siege ==
The Latins did not attack the castle head on; rather, they began a prolonged siege, in order to tire the defenders. By surrounding the city with siege machinery and digging mines under the walls, they greatly weakened the defences and patiently waited for an opening. The main forces of Latin knights created well-structured guarded camps around the city to spot and ward off any aid that may have come. In front of each gate of the castle walls a unit was placed, which notably included a Venetian contingent led by Doge Enrico Dandolo.

Honouring his obligations to the rebellious Greeks, Tsar Kaloyan arrived with his army and encamped approximately 25 kilometers northeast of the city on April 10, 1205. According to Geoffrey of Villehardouin, a French historian and knight who had accompanied the Crusaders to the Balkans, the army consisted of up to 54,000 men.

== Location of the battle ==
Numerous researchers pinpoint the location of the battle north of Adrianople and near the keep of Vukelon - K. Jireče, V. Guzelev, St. Boyadjiev - yet there is no conclusive evidence.

According to Niketas Choniates, a Byzantine historian, in the day of the battle Tsar Kaloyan chose the place of the ambush in the following manner: &quot;After which Yoan and his army hid in the ravines, entered the precipice and through those steep places crept to the highlands, making sure their opponents did not notice they were there&quot;. In other scriptures, it reads &quot;...and hid in the narrows in the shadowy forests&quot;.

Tricked by the Cuman cavalry, the knights chased them for at least two leagues before reaching the place of the ambush, which is between 7 and 9 kilometers, depending on which French league Geoffrey of Villehardouin was using. According to Alberic of Trois-Fontaines, the location of the battle was &quot;plentiful with water marshes&quot;.

Nowadays, the most common site that is pointed as the place of the battle are the meanders of the Tùndzha river.

== Forces ==
===Army of Tsar/King Kaloyan===

According to the French historian Geoffrey of Villehardouin, the Bulgarian army numbered around 54,000 strong. Within that army were also the Vlachs,
and light cavalry of the Cumans, which, at that time, were allies or mercenaries of Kaloyan, as the Tsar himself was married to the Cuman princess Anna. The French historian points out that there were about 14,000 of them and that &quot;... they were not christened&quot;. Nonetheless, their cavalry played a key role in the battle.

===Army of the Latin Empire and Venice===

The Latin army at Adrianople had about 300 knights. They were accompanied by a number of cavalry and infantry (likely no more than 1000-1500 soldiers) and the Venetian forces, which, according to some sources, also numbered 1000-1500. The total number of troops was no greater than four thousand, yet it is not clear how many soldiers took part in the battle and how many stayed under the walls to continue the siege.

Geoffrey of Villehardouin points out that the majority of the knights, each with his own unit, as well as all the Venetians chased after the Cumans and Vlachs and directly into the Bulgarian ambush. Many names of knights who fought in the battle are mentioned: Emperor Baldwin I, Louis I, Count of Blois, Bishop Peter of Bethlehem, Stephen of Perche, Reno of Mentimirel, Robert of Ronsoa, Ustas of Umont, Count Jerar of Lombardy, Jan of Mazerol and others. According to the same historian, the entirety of the Venetian forces takes part in the battle, being led by Doge Enrico Dandolo himself.

===Forces of Adrianople and Thrace===

Although they do not take part in the battle itself, all of the Byzantine rebels from East Thrace had gathered at Adrianopole and stood bravely to defend its wall from the conquerors. Their numbers are unknown.

== Battle ==
The battle was fought for two days, one week after the Orthodox Easter celebration.

===First day, 13 April 1205===

On 13 April Kaloyan sent the Cuman cavalry to scout and to make a &quot;test attack&quot; against the knights. The Cumans landed a surprise attack on Emperor Baldwin I, then pretended to flee from the knights&#x27; skillful counter-attack. A long chase ensued, luring the knights out of their camps. At its conclusion the Cumans turned sharply around and began firing arrows at the stampeding enemy, killing many people and war horses. Realizing their own foolishness, the knights decided to stand their ground and wait for the attack of the Bulgarians. Baldwin made the decision to wait for all of the remaining knights and soldiers to gather and prepare for a proper battle, which would take place after the upcoming Easter celebrations.

During the preparation for the ambush, the Bulgarians dug &quot;trous de loup&quot; or &quot;wolf pits&quot;, in order to create obstacles for the movement and battle formation of the heavy cavalry knights. Kaloyan placed the infantry first in the ambush with the heavy cavalry in reserve, ready to intervene if the foot soldiers began to give in to the Latins. The light Cuman cavalry was given the order to lead the knights to the trap.

The same night Baldwin called a meeting with all of the present barons and leaders of the Fourth Crusade. They decided that, in the case of a new attack by the Cumans, the army must not follow, instead making a battle line formation in front of the camp.

===Second day, 14 April 1205===

On Thursday, 14 April 1205, during the celebration of Catholic Easter, the Cuman light cavalry made a sweeping attack on the camp of the knights with arrows, loud yells and ringing of steel. Outraged by this sacrilege, the knights armed, mounted, and got into battle formation. Count Louis I of Blois disregarded the plan made the night before and led his unit after the Cumans, and the other soldiers, already blinded by anger, followed his lead. The Cuman cavalry outpaced the Latins, and was obliged several times to stop and wait for the enemy to catch up, after which they had a mock fight and fled again. This lasted until they reached the ambush, located in a ravine among hills.

On the far side of the wolf pits the Cumans turned around, apparently offering a serious fight. The knights charged in with their characteristic formation, but were checked when many horses and riders fell into the pits. In the ensuing turmoil the Bulgarian infantry emerged from ambush and completely surrounded the knights. Baldwin soon arrived with the rest of the 200 knights, but was unable to break through the encirclement and free Count Louis. Seeing this, Kaloyan attacked and surrounded Baldwin with his heavy cavalry, isolating the Latins in two small groups. Bulgarian soldiers used ropes and hooked polearms to unhorse the knights, who were then finished off with swords, hammers and axes. Despite their broken formation and inability to coordinate, the surrounded Latins put up a hard fight which lasted until late in the evening. At its conclusion the main part of the Latin army had been annihilated and Baldwin I captured. He was taken to Veliko Tarnovo and imprisoned at the top of a tower in the Tsarevets fortress.

== Aftermath ==
The capture of the supposedly impregnable city of Constantinople had added to the knights&#x27; aura of invincibility. News of Adrianople broke this illusion, and within a year the Latin Empire had entered a state of decline.

===End of Emperor Baldwin I===

After his capture by the Bulgarians, the fate of Emperor Baldwin I was unknown to his subjects; his brother Henry of Flanders assumed regency in his absence. Whilst it is known that Baldwin died in captivity, the precise circumstances are unknown. Apparently treated at first as a valuable prisoner, he was later left to die in one of the towers of Tsarevets. There are many legends regarding his demise, the most famous being that he was condemned to death after trying to seduce Kaloyan&#x27;s wife. The historian George Acropolites reports that the Tsar had Baldwin&#x27;s skull made into a drinking cup, as had happened to Nikephoros I almost four hundred years before, but no evidence has been found to confirm this. Kaloyan informed both Pope Innocent III and Baldwin&#x27;s court of the Emperor&#x27;s death in prison. A tower of the Tsarevets fortress is still called Baldwin&#x27;s Tower.

===Kaloyan the Roman-slayer===

Two years after the battle of Adrianople, Kaloyan set out to burn other Latin cities and cities of Byzantine rebels, who had begun to conspire against him. Even though it was a bloody deed, the Byzantian historian George Akropolites gives the following explanation as to why the tsar gave the orders: &quot;He was exacting revenge, as they say, for the evil, which Basil II did against the Bulgarians; and, as he said, as Basil dubbed himself the Bulgarian-slayer, he named himself the Roman-slayer...&quot;

<text>Song, known as Liu Song (), Former Song (前宋) or Song of (the) Southern dynasties (南朝宋) in historiography, was an imperial dynasty of China and the first of the four Southern dynasties during the Northern and Southern dynasties period. It succeeded the Eastern Jin dynasty and preceded the Southern Qi dynasty.

The dynasty was founded by Liu Yu (Emperor Wu; 363–422 CE), whose surname together with &quot;Song&quot; forms the common name for the dynasty, the &quot;Liu Song&quot;. This appellation is used to distinguish it from a later dynasty of the same name, the Song dynasty (960–1279 CE, ruled by the House of Zhao). Although the Liu Song has also at times been referred to as the &quot;Southern Song&quot;, the name is now mainly used to refer to the Song dynasty after 1127 CE.

The Liu Song was a time when there was much internal turmoil. A number of emperors were incompetent and/or tyrannical, which at least partially led to many military revolts. These rulers include Liu Shao, Emperor Xiaowu, Liu Ziye, Emperor Ming, and Liu Yu. Emperor Ming was especially vicious, murdering many of his brothers, nephews, and other male relatives — many of them children. Such internal instability eventually led to the dynasty&#x27;s destruction. However, its founder Emperor Wu was considered one of the greatest generals during the Northern and Southern dynasties period, and the reign of its third emperor, Emperor Wen, is known for its political stability and capable administration, not only of its emperor but its strong and honest officials. This is known as the Reign of Yuanjia (425–453) and one of the relative golden ages for the Southern Dynasties.

==History==
===Rise of Liu Yu===
Although he was a descendant of Emperor Gaozu of Han&#x27;s younger brother Liu Jiao, he was still born into poverty. He joined the army at a young age, quickly distinguished himself in the army and was quickly promoted to the command of an army, the Beifu corps. Liu Yu was instrumental in fighting the rebel Huan Xuan. After Huan Xuan&#x27;s fall, Liu Yu gained control of the Jin dynasty.

===Campaigns of Liu Yu===
Regarded as one of the best generals of the Northern and Southern dynasties, Liu Yu started off by reclaiming much of the territory the Chinese had lost during the Sixteen Kingdoms era. He started off his career by campaigning against Southern Yan, which bordered Jin to the north and had adopted a policy of aggression and kidnapping citizens from the Jin. By spring of 410, he had captured the southern Yan capital at Guanggu, ending Southern Yan.

Afterwards, he campaigned against western Shu in modern Sichuan. Using a brilliant military manoeuver mentioned in the Art of War, Liu Yu instructed his generals to attack the capital of Shu by the Min River rather than the short route by the Fu river. Surprising the Shu forces, he quickly captured Chengdu and re-annexed that area back into Jin.
Following the death of the Later Qin Emperor Yao Xin, Liu Yu attacked the state of Later Qin, which controlled the valuable lands of Guanzhong, lands which had once housed the capital of the Qin, Han and Jin dynasties before the barbarian uprisings. After defeating the Later Qin army in several battles, as well as an army of Northern Wei troops which had crossed to assist the Later Qin, Liu Yu recaptured the vital cities of Chang&#x27;an and Luoyang, the former capitals of the Jin Empire. It is recorded that he engaged the Wei army by the use of spears launched by crossbows, panicking the Wei cavalry and allowing him to score a decisive victory.

After this success, it seemed that Jin would exterminate the remaining barbarian states in the north and reunify China. However, fortunes began to change for the Jin forces. Liu Mengzhi died and in order to secure his power, Liu Yu left for Jiankang (present-day Nanjing), abandoning the management of the North to his general Wang Zhen&#x27;e. After his departure, the state of Xia attacked Guanzhong and reoccupied it, and the loss of these lands prescribed Jin&#x27;s frontier at the Yellow River. However, Jin retained its former eastern capital, Luoyang, as well as most of the Chinese heartland.

Following his return to Jiankang, Liu Yu ended the rule of the Jin and became emperor himself in 420, establishing the Liu Song dynasty. The name of the dynasty was taken from Liu&#x27;s fief, which occupied roughly the same territory as the Spring &amp; Autumn era State of Song. The Book of Song does not mention whether the Liu family had any blood relationship to the ancient state&#x27;s ruling House of Zi, or by extension to the Shang dynasty. It is in any case noteworthy that Liu did not frame his new regime as a restoration of the Han dynasty, despite being demonstrably related to the Han imperial family. Liu died in 422 CE, and was succeeded by the incompetent Shaodi, who was quickly removed. His eventual successor would be his third son, Wendi.

===Reign of Emperor Wen===
Under Emperor Wen, the Liu Song economy prospered during the rule of Yuanjia (), a period noted for its prosperity in the 400 years of conflict between the Han and Tang dynasties. However, the emperor&#x27;s martial abilities were not equal to his father, and his inability to crush the remaining barbarian states allowed Northern Wei to complete the unification of the North, to the detriment of Liu Song. Afterwards, Northern Wei would remain a grave and permanent threat to the Liu Song.

==== War with Northern Wei ==== 
Emperor Wen continued the campaigns of his father; nevertheless, he was unsuccessful. In 422 CE, the first year of his reign, he lost three commanderies to Wei. Under the able general Dao Yanzhi, however, Liu Song recovered the four cities of Luoyang, Hulao, Huatai and Qiao&#x27;ao south of the Yellow River. However, the emperor&#x27;s unwillingness to advance past this line caused the destruction of the empire&#x27;s ally, Xia, by the Wei. The emperor was to repeat this mistake as several barbarian states who had offered to ally with Liu Song against Wei were declined, eventually leading to Wei&#x27;s unification of the North in 439 CE, to the detriment of the Chinese.

Towards the later part of his reign, Emperor Wen was less than able. He wrongfully executed the general Tan Daoji, who had hitherto commanded the Song armies, and took charge himself. The empire&#x27;s decline was shown in 450 CE, where the emperor attempted to destroy the Northern Wei himself, and launched a massive invasion. Although initially successful, the campaign turned into a disaster. The Wei lured the Liu Song to cross the Yellow River, and then flanked them, destroying the Eastern army. As the Liu Song armies retreated, the provinces south of the Yellow River were devastated by the Wei army. Only Huatai, a fortified city, held out against the Wei. However, the economic damage was immense. The barbarian troops laid waste to the provinces they had temporarily occupied, as described by Sima Guang: 
The Wei forces laid South Yan, Xu, North Yan, Yu, Qing, and Ji Provinces to waste. The Song deaths and injuries were innumerable. When Wei forces encountered Song young men, the forces quickly beheaded them or cut them in half. The infants were pierced through with spears, and the spears were then shaken so that the infants would scream as they were spun, for entertainment. The commanderies and counties that Wei forces went through were burned and slaughtered, and not even grass was left. When sparrows returned in the spring, they could not find houses to build nest on, so they had to do so in forests. Wei soldiers and horses also suffered casualties of more than half, and the Xianbei people were all complaining.
Sima Guang also pointed out the cause of Liu Song&#x27;s disaster:
 Every time Emperor Wen sent generals out on battles, he required them to follow the complete battle plans that he had drafted, and even the dates for battles needed approval from the emperor. Therefore, the generals all hesitated and could not make independent decisions. Further, the non-regular troops that he conscripted were not trained, and they rushed to advance when they were victorious and scattered when they were defeated. These were the two reasons why he failed, and from this point on, the state was in recession, and the Reign of Yuanjia was in decline.
Another historian, Shen Yue, pointed out Emperor Wen was said to model his command on the great general Emperor Guangwu of Han, but he lacked the latter&#x27;s command abilities.

Emperor Wen made another attempt to destroy Northern Wei in 452, but failed again. On returning to the capital, he was assassinated by the heir apparent, Liu Shao.

===Reign of Emperor Xiaowu and Qianfei===

Liu Shao&#x27;s assassination of his father in 453 CE raised indignation across the empire, as it disobeyed one of Confucianism&#x27;s fundamental principles, that of filial piety. Quickly, his brother Liu Jun rose against him, defeated him, and beheaded him. Once Liu Shao was killed. Liu Jun ascended to the throne and became Emperor Xiaowu. However, he was regarded as immoral and committed incest with his cousins and sisters, and reputed to have even done so with his mother. Nevertheless, his reign was a relatively peaceful one.

Following his death in 464 CE, Liu Jun passed his throne to his son, Liu Ziye, who was generally regarded as a tyrant. He disrespected his father and was suspicious of his uncles, putting several of them to death. He continued the incestuous streak of his father, adopting several of his aunts and cousins as concubines. He was reputed to have ordered all of the princesses to come to his palace and have sexual intercourse with him. When one of his aunts refused, he executed her three sons. He also put to death a lady-in-waiting who bore a resemblance to a woman who cursed him in a dream. Eventually, one of his uncles could not bear it, rose up, and assassinated him.

===Liu Zixun&#x27;s rebellion===
The man who assassinated Qianfei quickly became emperor himself and declared himself emperor Ming. He ordered Liu Ziye&#x27;s brother Liu Zishang and sister Liu Chuyu, who were reputed to have participated in the late emperor&#x27;s sexual immorality and tyrannical governance, to commit suicide. However, his claim to the throne was not accepted by Liu Zixun, one of his nephews, who then rose against him.

The civil war at first was a great success for Liu Zixun, who quickly overran nearly the entire empire. However, he moved too slowly. Emperor Ming quickly sent an army westward, captured Kuaiji, a vital food supply. Another of his generals captured Qianxi and cut off Liu Zixun&#x27;s supplies. Starving, his troops collapsed and Liu Zixun was killed, aged just 10.

However, Emperor Ming grew arrogant and refused to grant a pardon to those who had supported Liu Ziye. This action was extremely detrimental to Liu Song and its successors, as the governors of the northern commandries, fearing their lives, surrendered to Wei rather than face execution at Jiankang. This resulted in the loss of the Chinese heartland and the most fertile and cultivated lands at that time. This loss would eventually lead to the destruction of the southern regime, and resulted in North China languishing under a barbarian yoke for another 150 years. Although Emperor Ming attempted to recover them, his attempts were defeated.

Emperor Ming&#x27;s later reign was extremely brutal. Suspicious of his nephews, he had them all executed. Afraid of usurpation from rival members of the royal family, he executed thousands of members of the royal family, which was greatly weakened. Upon his death, his son had to be assisted by the general Xiao Daocheng, as nearly all of Emperor Ming&#x27;s brothers and nephews had been killed.

===Fall of Liu Song===
The successor to the emperor Ming, emperor Houfei, was resentful of the control Xiao Daocheng had over him and announced openly several times he would kill him. Fearful of his demise, Xiao had him assassinated and placed Emperor Shun on his throne. In 479, Xiao took the throne himself and declared himself Emperor of Qi, ending Liu Song. The ex-emperor Shun and his clan were soon put to the sword.

Liu Hui (刘辉) was a descendant of Liu Song royalty who fled north to the Xianbei Northern Wei in exile and married the Xianbei Princess Lanling (蘭陵公主), daughter of the Xianbei Emperor Xiaowen of Northern Wei. More than fifty percent of Tuoba Xianbei princesses of the Northern Wei were married to southern Han Chinese men from the imperial families and aristocrats from southern China of the Southern dynasties who defected and moved north to join the Northern Wei.

==Literature and culture==
Despite, and certainly to some extent because of, the chaotic warfare between the Northern and Southern dynasties, the Liu Song produced much poetry (&quot;shi&quot; 詩) notably the rhapsody, &quot;fu&quot; 賦. The imperial house sponsored many literary works, and many wrote themselves. The court of Emperor Wen was especially active in literary circles, with Liu supporting the compilation of a large collection of short prose anecdotes, &quot;A New Account of the Tales of the World&quot; (&quot;Shishuo Xinyu&quot;). The &quot;Three Giants of Yuanjia,&quot; Bao Zhao (鮑照) (d. 466), Xie Lingyun (謝霊運) (385–433 CE), and Yan Yanzhi (顏延之) (384–456 CE) are among the best known poets of the Song, each of them being credited as the originators of the three major literary trends to follow.

Scientists and astronomers were also active during periods of relative peace. Buddhism also began to be better understood and more widely practised at this time, and some officials such as Xie Lingyun, were Buddhists.

Liu Song sculptors may have created a number of spirit way ensembles, generally characteristic of the Six Dynasties era, for the tombs of the dynasty&#x27;s emperors and other dignitaries. However, according to a survey of the extant Six Dynasties&#x27; sculpture in the Nanjing and Danyang areas, only one of the extant Six Dynasties&#x27; tomb sculptural groups has been securely identified as belonging to the Liu Song: the Chuning Tomb of the first emperor of the dynasty. Two &quot;qilin&quot; statues of this tomb survive in the appropriately named Qilin Town in Nanjing&#x27;s suburban Jiangning District.

In 440 CE, the dynasty changed its official religion to Taoism, replacing Buddhism.

==Science==
Zu Chongzhi, a noted astronomer, lived during the Liu Song period. He was noted for calculating pi to seven decimal places and as the author of a variety of other astronomical theories.

<text>Anita Belle Colton (October 18, 1919 – November 23, 2006), known professionally as Anita O&#x27;Day, was an American jazz singer and self-proclaimed “song stylist” widely admired for her sense of rhythm and dynamics, and her early big band appearances that shattered the traditional image of the &quot;girl singer&quot;. Refusing to pander to any female stereotype, O&#x27;Day presented herself as a &quot;hip&quot; jazz musician, wearing a band jacket and skirt as opposed to an evening gown. She changed her surname from Colton to O&#x27;Day, pig Latin for &quot;dough&quot;, slang for money.

==Early career==
Anita Belle Colton (who later took the surname &quot;O&#x27;Day&quot;) was born to Irish parents, James and Gladys M. (née Gill) Colton in Kansas City, Missouri, and raised in Chicago, Illinois, during the Great Depression. Colton took the first chance to leave her unhappy home when, at age 14, she became a contestant in the popular Walk-a-thons as a dancer. She toured with the Walk-a-thons circuits for two years, occasionally being called upon to sing. In 1934, she began touring the Midwest as a marathon dance contestant.

In 1936, she left the endurance contests, determined to become a professional singer. She started out as a chorus girl in such Uptown venues as the Celebrity Club and the Vanity Fair, and then found work as a singer and waitress at the Ball of Fire, the Vialago, and the Planet Mars. At the Vialago, O&#x27;Day met the drummer Don Carter, who introduced her to music theory; they wed in 1937. Her first big break came in 1938 when &quot;DownBeat&quot; editor Carl Cons hired her to work at his new club at 222 North State Street, the Off-Beat, which became a popular hangout for musicians. Also performing at the Off-Beat was the Max Miller Quartet, which backed O&#x27;Day for the first ten days of her stay there. While performing at the Off Beat, she met Gene Krupa, who promised to call her if Irene Daye, then his vocalist, ever left his band. In 1939, O&#x27;Day was hired as vocalist for Miller&#x27;s Quartet, which had a stay at the Three Deuces club in Chicago.

==Work with Krupa, Herman, and Kenton==
The call from Krupa came in early 1941. Of the 34 sides she recorded with Krupa, it was &quot;Let Me Off Uptown&quot;, a novelty duet with Roy Eldridge, that became her first big hit. The same year, &quot;DownBeat&quot; named O&#x27;Day &quot;New Star of the Year&quot;. In 1942, she appeared with the Krupa band in two &quot;soundies&quot; (short musical films originally made for jukeboxes), singing &quot;Thanks for the Boogie Ride&quot; and &quot;Let Me Off Uptown&quot;. The same year, &quot;DownBeat&quot; magazine readers voted her into the top five big band singers. O&#x27;Day came in fourth, with Helen O&#x27;Connell first, Helen Forrest second, Billie Holiday third, and Dinah Shore fifth. O&#x27;Day married golf professional and jazz fan, Carl Hoff, in 1942.

When Krupa&#x27;s band broke up, after he was arrested in 1943 for marijuana possession, O&#x27;Day joined Woody Herman for a month-long gig at the Hollywood Palladium, followed by two weeks at the Orpheum. Unwilling to tour with another big band, she left Herman after the Orpheum engagement, and finished out the year as a solo artist. Despite her initial misgivings about the compatibility of their musical styles, she joined Stan Kenton&#x27;s band in April 1944. During her 11 months with Kenton, O&#x27;Day recorded 21 sides, both transcription and commercial, and appeared in a Universal Pictures short &quot;Artistry in Rhythm&quot; (1944). &quot;And Her Tears Flowed Like Wine&quot; (1944) became a huge seller and put Kenton&#x27;s band on the map. She also appeared in one soundie with Kenton, performing &quot;I&#x27;m Going Mad for a Pad&quot; and &quot;Tabby the Cat&quot;. O&#x27;Day later said &quot;My time with Stanley helped nurture and cultivate my innate sense of chord structure.&quot; In 1945, she rejoined Krupa&#x27;s band and stayed almost a year. The reunion yielded 10 sides. After leaving Krupa late in 1946, O&#x27;Day again became a solo artist.

==Post-war work and drug arrests==
During the late 1940s, O&#x27;Day was trying to achieve popular success without sacrificing her identity as a jazz singer. During this period she recorded two dozen sides, mostly for small labels. Among the more notable recordings from this time are &quot;Hi Ho Trailus Boot Whip&quot;, &quot;Key Largo&quot;, &quot;How High the Moon&quot;, &quot;I Told Ya I Love Ya, Now Get Out&quot;, and &quot;Malaguena&quot;. While living with husband Carl Hoff in Los Angeles in March 1947, two undercover policemen came to their home, during a party at which Dizzy Gillespie was playing from the branches of a tree in their front yard. They found a small bag of marijuana, for which Anita and Carl were arrested. On August 11, Judge Harold B. Landreth found them guilty, and handed down 90-day sentences. After her jail stint, she performed with Woody Herman&#x27;s Herd and the Stan Kenton Artistry In Rhythm Orchestra. Her career was back on the upswing in September 1948 when she sang with Count Basie at the Royal Roost in New York City, resulting in five airchecks. What secured O&#x27;Day&#x27;s place in the jazz pantheon, however, were the 17 albums she recorded for Norman Granz&#x27;s Norgran and Verve labels between 1952 and 1962.

Her first album, &quot;Anita O&#x27;Day Sings Jazz&quot; (reissued as &quot;The Lady Is a Tramp&quot;), was recorded in 1952 for the newly established Norgran Records (it was also the label&#x27;s first LP). The album was a critical success and boosted her popularity. In February 1953, she was in court again for another marijuana charge, this time for smoking a joint while riding in a car. The case was dismissed by a jury for lack of evidence, but while awaiting her trial, O&#x27;Day was introduced to sniffing heroin by Harry the Hipster. She had switched from marijuana to alcohol after her second arrest, and her first thought on feeling the effects of heroin was, &quot;Oh good, now I don&#x27;t have to drink.&quot; Within a month, she allegedly was framed on a heroin charge and was facing six years in prison. Soon after her release from jail on February 25, 1954, she began work on her second album, &quot;Songs by Anita O&#x27;Day&quot; (reissued as &quot;An Evening with Anita O&#x27;Day&quot;). She recorded steadily throughout the 1950s, accompanied by small combos and big bands. In person, O&#x27;Day generally was backed by a trio that included John Poole, the drummer with whom she would work for the next 40 years.

As a live performer, O&#x27;Day began performing in festivals and concerts with musicians such as Louis Armstrong, Oscar Peterson, Dinah Washington, George Shearing, Cal Tjader and Thelonious Monk. She appeared in the documentary &quot;Jazz on a Summer&#x27;s Day&quot;, filmed at the 1958 Newport Jazz Festival, which increased her popularity. She admitted later that she was probably high on heroin during the concert. 

The following year, O&#x27;Day made a cameo appearance in &quot;The Gene Krupa Story&quot;, singing &quot;Memories of You&quot;. Late in 1959, she toured Europe with Benny Goodman to great personal acclaim. O&#x27;Day wrote in her 1981 autobiography that when Goodman&#x27;s attempts to upstage her failed to diminish the audience&#x27;s enthusiasm, he cut all but two of her numbers from the show.

O&#x27;Day went back to touring as a solo artist and appeared on such TV specials as the &quot;Timex All-Star Jazz Show&quot; and &quot;The Swingin&#x27; Years&quot; hosted by Ronald Reagan. She recorded infrequently after the expiration of her Verve contract in 1962, and her career seemed over when she nearly died of a heroin overdose in 1968. During this time, her working trio included Chicagoan George Finley on drums, father of performance artist Karen Finley. After kicking the habit, she made a comeback at the 1970 Berlin Jazz Festival. She also appeared in the films &quot;Zig Zag&quot; a.k.a. &quot;False Witness&quot; with George Kennedy (1970) and &quot;The Outfit&quot; (1974) with Robert Duvall. She resumed making live and studio albums under the new management of Alan Eichler, many recorded in Japan, and several were released on Emily Records, owned by Anita O&#x27;Day and John Poole.

==Memoir and later life==
In November 1980, she was a headliner along with Clark Terry, Lionel Hampton and Ramsey Lewis, during the opening two-week ceremony performances celebrating the short-lived resurgence of the Blue Note Lounge at the Marriott O&#x27;Hare Hotel near Chicago. O&#x27;Day spoke candidly about her drug addiction in her 1981 memoir &quot;High Times, Hard Times&quot;, which led to a string of TV appearances on &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;, &quot;The Today Show&quot; with Bryant Gumbel, &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot;, &quot;Over Easy&quot; with Hugh Downs, &quot;The Tomorrow Show&quot; with Tom Snyder, and several others. She toured Europe and performed a 50th Anniversary Concert (1985) at Carnegie Hall, which resulted in the 2010 release of &quot;Anita O&#x27;Day – Big Band at Carnegie Hall&quot; (Emily Productions).

Following a life-threatening fall down a staircase at the end of 1996, she made a comeback in 1999, resuming her career with the help of long-time manager Alan Eichler. In 2005, her version of the standard &quot;Sing, Sing, Sing&quot; was remixed by RSL and was included in the compilation album &quot;Verve Remixed 3&quot;. The following year, she released &quot;Indestructible!&quot;, her first album in 13 years and her last studio album. During this period pianist John Colianni was her accompanist for numerous club appearances and special gigs (Colianni also plays on &quot;Indestructible!&quot;).

One of her better known late-career audio performances is &quot;Is You Is or Is You Ain&#x27;t My Baby&quot;, which opens the film &quot;Shortbus&quot; (2006) by John Cameron Mitchell.

In November 2006, Robbie Cavolina (her last manager) entered her into a West Hollywood convalescent hospital while she recovered from pneumonia. Two days before her death, she had demanded to be released from the hospital. On November 23, 2006, at age 87, O&#x27;Day died in her sleep. The official cause of death was cardiac arrest.

The feature-length documentary &quot;Anita O&#x27;Day: The Life of a Jazz Singer&quot;, directed by Robbie Cavolina and Ian McCrudden, premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 30, 2007.

==Style==

O&#x27;Day cited Martha Raye as the primary influence on her vocal style, also expressing admiration for Mildred Bailey, Ella Fitzgerald, and Billie Holiday. She always maintained that the accidental excision of her uvula during a childhood tonsillectomy left her incapable of vibrato, and unable to maintain long phrases. That botched operation, she claimed, forced her to develop a more percussive style based on short notes and rhythmic drive. However, when she was in good voice she could stretch long notes with strong crescendos and a telescoping vibrato, e.g. her live version of &quot;Sweet Georgia Brown&quot; at the 1958 Newport Jazz Festival, captured in Bert Stern&#x27;s film &quot;Jazz on a Summer&#x27;s Day&quot;.

<doc id="56986" wikidata="Q1330294" url="?curid=56986" title="Jiankang">
<text>Jiankang (), or Jianye (), as it was originally called, was the capital city of the Eastern Wu (229–265 and 266–280 CE), the Eastern Jin dynasty (317–420 CE) and the Southern Dynasties (420–552), including the Chen dynasty (557–589 CE). Its walls are extant as ruins in the modern municipal region of Nanjing. Jiankang was an important city of the Song dynasty. Its name was changed to Nanjing during the Ming dynasty. 

==History==

Before the Eastern Jin the city was known as Jianye, and it was the capital of the kingdom of Wu during the Three Kingdoms period. It was renamed Jiankang during the Jin dynasty, in order to observe the naming taboo for Emperor Min of Jin. 

Renamed Jiankang in 313 CE, it served as the capital of the Eastern Jin and Southern Dynasties, following the retreat from the north due to Xiongnu raids. It rivaled Luoyang in population and commercial activity, and at its height, in the sixth century, it was home to around one million people. In 549 CE, during the rebellion of Hou Jing, Jiankang was captured after a year-long siege that devastated the city: most of the population were killed or starved to death. During the national reunification under the Sui dynasty it was almost completely destroyed, and was renamed Jiangzhou () and then Danyang Commandery (). Under the Tang dynasty, the city regained its prosperity and the name became Jinling (). By the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period it was called Jiangning (); in the Southern Song dynasty the name of Jiankang was revived.

When Zhu Yuanzhang, the Hongwu Emperor, founded the Ming dynasty in 1368, he made Jiankang the capital of China, renaming it Nanjing, &quot;Southern Capital&quot;.

===Six Dynasties===
The Tang historian Xu Song (許嵩, Xǔ Sōng), in his work &quot;Jiankang Shilu&quot; (建康實錄, Jiànkāng Shílù), coined the term &quot;Six Dynasties&quot; for the various regimes that had centred their power on the site:
* Eastern Wu (222–280 CE)
* Eastern Jin (317–420 CE)
* Liu Song dynasty (420–479 CE)
* Southern Qi (479–502 CE)
* Liang (502–557 CE)
* Chen (557–589 CE)

In the 6th century, Jiankang may well have been the largest city in the world, with a population of probably more than one million people. At that time, Rome had a population of less than 100,000, Constantinople had about 500,000, and Luoyang had more than 500,000.

<text>Paul Edward Lynde (; June 13, 1926January 10, 1982) was an American comedian, actor and game show panelist. A character actor with a distinctively campy and snarky persona that often poked fun at his closeted homosexuality, Lynde was well known for his roles as Uncle Arthur on &quot;Bewitched,&quot; the befuddled father Harry MacAfee in &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot; and a regular &quot;center square&quot; panelist on the game show &quot;The Hollywood Squares&quot; from 1968 to 1981. He also voiced animated characters for five Hanna-Barbera productions.

Lynde regularly topped audience polls of most-liked TV stars, and was routinely admired and recognized by his peers during his lifetime. Mel Brooks once described Lynde as being capable of getting laughs by reading &quot;a phone book, tornado alert, or seed catalogue&quot;. Lynde once said that, while he would rather be recognized as a serious actor, &quot;we live in a world that needs laughter and I&#x27;ve decided if I can make people laugh, I&#x27;m making a more important contribution.&quot;

== Early life ==
Paul Lynde was born in Mount Vernon, Ohio, the son of Sylvia Bell Lynde () and Hoy Corydon Lynde, who owned and operated a meat market. Fifth-born among six siblings, Lynde had older sisters, Grace and Helen, older brothers, Richard Hoy and Coradon (&quot;Cordy&quot;) George and younger brother, John (&quot;Johnny&quot;). His favorite brother, Coradon, died in 1944 at the age of 21, in the Battle of the Bulge in World War II. In 1949, his parents died within three months of each other.

Lynde graduated from Mount Vernon High School in 1944, where he played the bass drum in the high school band. He then studied speech and drama at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, where his classmates included Cloris Leachman, Charlotte Rae, Patricia Neal, Jeffrey Hunter, and Claude Akins. He was active in the school&#x27;s theatrical productions, and joined the Upsilon chapter of the fraternity Phi Kappa Sigma. He is listed among its most famous members. He graduated in 1948.

== Career ==
After graduating from college, Lynde moved to New York City, taking odd jobs while looking for his show business break. His first appearance as a comic was at the famed supper club Number One Fifth Avenue. He made his Broadway debut in the hit revue &quot;New Faces of 1952&quot; in which he co-starred with fellow newcomers Eartha Kitt, Robert Clary, Alice Ghostley, and Carol Lawrence. In his monologue from that revue, the &quot;Trip of the Month Club&quot;, Lynde portrayed a man on crutches recounting his misadventures on the African safari trip he took with his late wife. The show was filmed and released as &quot;New Faces&quot; in 1954.

After the revue&#x27;s run, Lynde co-starred in the short-lived 1956 sitcom &quot;Stanley&quot; opposite Buddy Hackett and Carol Burnett, both of whom were also starting their careers in show business. That year, he guest-starred on NBC&#x27;s sitcom &quot;The Martha Raye Show&quot;.

Lynde returned to Broadway in 1960 when he was cast as Harry MacAfee, the father in &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot;. He also played the role in the 1963 film adaptation. That year, he recorded a live album, &quot;Recently Released&quot;, issued as an LP. He wrote all six tracks. Once he could afford writers, he rarely used his own material until his tenure on &quot;The Hollywood Squares&quot; years later.

Lynde was in great demand in the 1960s. During the 196162 television season he was a regular on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Perry Como Show&quot; as part of the Kraft Music Hall players with Don Adams, Kaye Ballard, and Sandy Stewart. He was a familiar face on many sitcoms, including &quot;The Phil Silvers Show&quot;, &quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, &quot;The Patty Duke Show&quot;, &quot;The Munsters&quot;, &quot;The Flying Nun&quot;, &quot;Gidget&quot;, &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot;, and &quot;F Troop&quot;; and on variety shows such as &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; and &quot;The Dean Martin Show&quot;. He also was featured in several 1960s films, including &quot;Send Me No Flowers&quot; and &quot;The Glass Bottom Boat&quot;, both starring Doris Day. Lynde is widely known for his sitcom role on &quot;Bewitched&quot;.

=== &quot;Bewitched&quot; ===

In 1965, Lynde made his debut appearance on &quot;Bewitched&quot; during the first-season episode &quot;Driving is the Only Way to Fly&quot; (air date March 25, 1965). His role as mortal Harold Harold, Samantha Stephens&#x27; nervous driving instructor, was well received by viewers. Lynde also impressed series star Elizabeth Montgomery and her husband, director/producer William Asher, who created a recurring role for Lynde as Endora&#x27;s practical-joking brother Uncle Arthur. Lynde made ten appearances on &quot;Bewitched&quot; as the beloved character, the first being &quot;The Joker is a Card&quot; (air date October 14, 1965). His final appearance in the sitcom was in &quot;The House That Uncle Arthur Built&quot; (February 11, 1971) in the series&#x27; seventh season. Paul Lynde, Elizabeth Montgomery, and William Asher became good friends and were regularly seen together off the set.

=== Television pilots ===
Lynde starred in four failed television pilots in the 1960s:
* &quot;Howie&quot; (1962, CBS)
* &quot;Two&#x27;s Company&quot; (1965, ABC)
* &quot;Sedgewick Hawk-Styles: Prince of Danger&quot; (1966, ABC)
* &quot;Manley and the Mob&quot; (1967, ABC)

Of the four shows, only the Victorian detective spoof &quot;Sedgewick Hawk-Styles: Prince of Danger&quot; was initially picked up by ABC, only to be canceled at the last minute. William Asher commented in the A&amp;E &quot;Biography&quot; episode on Lynde that ABC had reservations about Lynde, most notably his increasingly erratic offscreen behavior and the persistent rumors of his homosexuality.

=== &quot;The Hollywood Squares&quot; ===
In 1966, Lynde debuted on the fledgling game show &quot;The Hollywood Squares&quot; and quickly became its iconic guest star. Eventually, he assumed a permanent spot as the &quot;center square&quot;, a move that ensured that he would be called upon by contestants at least once in almost every round. Despite an urban legend claiming Lynde&#x27;s contract guaranteed him the center square, he remained in the center at the producers&#x27; discretion.

On &quot;The Hollywood Squares&quot;, Lynde was best able to showcase his comedic talents with short, salty one-liners, spoken in his signature snickering delivery. Many gags were thinly-veiled allusions to his homosexuality. Other jokes relied on double entendre, an alleged fondness for deviant behaviors, or dealt with touchy subject matter for 1970s television.

Appearing in 1083 episodes, Lynde garnered considerable fame and wealth from the series. He eventually became disenchanted with being what he called &quot;boxed in&quot; to &quot;The Hollywood Squares&quot; and he departed the series in 1979. In 1980, &quot;The Hollywood Squares&quot; experienced a downward trend in Nielsen ratings and Lynde was approached about returning to the program. He initially declined but changed his mind when told he would receive co-star billing with host Peter Marshall. He returned to the series in the spring of 1980 and remained with the show until its cancellation in February 1981.
=== Voice acting ===
Between 1969 and 1974, Lynde did extensive voice work on animated cartoons, particularly for Hanna-Barbera Productions. His most notable roles include:
* Templeton, the gluttonous rat in the 1973 animated feature &quot;Charlotte&#x27;s Web&quot;;
* Mildew Wolf, from &quot;It&#x27;s the Wolf!&quot; (a segment of &quot;Cattanooga Cats&quot;);
* Claude Pertwee, neighbor on &quot;Where&#x27;s Huddles?&quot;; and
* Sylvester Sneekly (aka &quot;Hooded Claw&quot;) in &quot;The Perils of Penelope Pitstop&quot;

Lynde&#x27;s sardonic inflections added a dimension to such lines as the sly, drawn-out whine, &quot;What&#x27;s in it for &quot;meeee?&quot;&quot; His distinctive voice remains popular among impressionists. Although it is sometimes assumed that actress Alice Ghostley based her speech patterns and mannerisms on Lynde&#x27;s, according to actress Kaye Ballard, &quot;It was Paul who was influenced by Alice.&quot;

=== &quot;The Paul Lynde Show&quot; and &quot;Temperatures Rising&quot; ===
In 1972, Lynde starred in a short-lived ABC sitcom, &quot;The Paul Lynde Show&quot;. The series was a contractual fulfillment to ABC in place of an aborted ninth season of &quot;Bewitched&quot;.

Lynde starred as Paul Simms, an uptight attorney, and father who was at odds with his liberal-minded son-in-law. The family included wife Martha (Elizabeth Allen), daughters Sally (Pamelyn Ferdin) and Barbara (Jane Actman), Barbara&#x27;s husband Howie (John Calvin) and Howie&#x27;s parents (Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara).

Critics considered the show to be derivative of &quot;All in the Family,&quot; television&#x27;s then most-popular primetime program, although many admitted the writing was excellent and that the sexual innuendoes gave it an extra note of spice. Lynde was nominated for a Best Actor Golden Globe for the show. Scheduled opposite the first half of the Top 30 hit &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; on CBS and the Top 20 hit &quot;Adam-12&quot; on NBC, the series garnered low ratings and was canceled after one season.

Contemporaneous media reports showed that viewers liked Lynde but not &quot;The Paul Lynde Show&quot; and liked another ABC show, &quot;Temperatures Rising&quot;, but disliked co-star James Whitmore. Unhappy himself, Whitmore left the show and ABC moved Lynde to &quot;Temperatures Rising&quot; for the 197374 season. This move came despite the objections of William Asher, producer of both shows, who also quit in protest of ABC&#x27;s meddling.

Ratings for &quot;The New Temperatures Rising&quot; were even lower than the previous season, in part because Asher&#x27;s replacements shifted the show&#x27;s tone to a much darker one than the previous season. ABC canceled the show and its time slot was taken by mid-season replacement &quot;Happy Days&quot;.

ABC later decided to resuscitate the program, with additional cast changes (most notably, Alice Ghostley, who replaced Sudie Bond in the role of Lynde&#x27;s sister, Edwina). ABC also convinced Asher, who admitted Lynde&#x27;s presence likely saved the series, to come back. Seven further episodes were produced for Summer 1974 airings, after which the series was permanently canceled.

Lynde was a fixture on the Kenley Players summer stock theater circuit, appearing in &quot;Don&#x27;t Drink the Water&quot; (1970, 1979), &quot;The Impossible Years&quot; (1969, 1978), &quot;Mother is Engaged&quot; (1974), &quot;My Daughter is Rated X&quot; (1973), &quot;Plaza Suite&quot; (1971), and &quot;Stop, Thief, Stop!&quot; (a retitled production of the play &quot;Three Goats and a Blanket,&quot; 1975). In all he appeared in nine Kenley Players productions, more than any other headliner. In the summer of 1980 Lynde toured the United States and Canada, headlining three one-act plays of &quot;California Suite&quot;, &quot;Plaza Suite&quot;, and &quot;Last of the Red Hot Lovers&quot;, entitled &#x27;Neil Simon&#x27;s Suite&#x27;, with cast members, Beverly Sanders, friend and bodyguard Paul Barresi, and Kristie Siverson.

=== Television specials and variety shows ===
Lynde&#x27;s continuing popularity led to his being signed by ABC to host a series of specials from 1975 to 1979, including:
* &quot;The Paul Lynde Comedy Hour&quot; (November 6, 1975) with Jack Albertson, Nancy Walker, and the Osmonds;
* &quot;The Paul Lynde Halloween Special&quot; (October 29, 1976) featuring the first prime-time network appearance of KISS, along with Margaret Hamilton recreating her role as the Wicked Witch of the West from &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. Hamilton and Billie Hayes (as &quot;H. R. Pufnstuf&quot;&#x27;s Witchiepoo) teamed up in a skit where they ask Lynde to help them improve their (witches) image. Other guests included Betty White, Donny and Marie Osmond, Tim Conway, and Roz Kelly;
* &quot;The Paul Lynde Comedy Hour&quot; (April 23, 1977) with Cloris Leachman and Tony Randall;
* &quot;&#x27;Twas the Night Before Christmas&quot; (December 7, 1977) with Alice Ghostley, Martha Raye, George Gobel, and Foster Brooks;
* &quot;The Paul Lynde Comedy Hour&quot; (May 20, 1978) with Juliet Prowse, Brenda Vaccaro, and Harry Morgan;
* &quot;Paul Lynde at the Movies&quot; (March 24, 1979) with Betty White, Vicki Lawrence, Robert Urich, and Gary Coleman;
* &quot;Paul Lynde Goes M-A-A-A-AD&quot; (May 20, 1979) with Marie Osmond, Charo, and Vicki Lawrence

Lynde was a regular guest on the variety show &quot;Donny &amp; Marie&quot; between 1976 and 1978, until he lost his guest-starring role due to very public, drunken arguments with police officers.

=== Guest appearances and film roles ===
Acting jobs continued to be scarce for Lynde, although it is unclear whether or not this was related to his alcoholism, which made him difficult to work with. As demand for his services declined, he accepted a wider variety of job offers.

In 1978, he appeared as a guest weatherman for WSPD-TV in Toledo, Ohio, to publicize both &quot;The Hollywood Squares&quot; and a summer stock performance.

In the 1979 comedy &quot;The Villain&quot; (released as &quot;Cactus Jack&quot; in the UK), he appeared as Indian chief Nervous Elk alongside former &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot; co-star Ann-Margret. It was his final film role.

In November 1980, the Beaux Arts Society, Inc. (founded in 1857) designated Paul Lynde &quot;King&quot; of the Beaux Arts Ball, with Kitty Carlisle designated as &quot;Queen&quot;. Paul Lynde remained a Life Member of the Beaux Arts Society from 1980 until his untimely death.

=== Awards ===
In 1976, at the Sixth Annual American Guild of Variety Artists (AGVA) &quot;Entertainer of the Year Awards&quot;, Lynde received an award for being voted the funniest man of the year. Lynde immediately turned his award over to host Jackie Gleason, citing him as &quot;the funniest man ever&quot;. The unexpected gesture shocked Gleason.

== Personal life ==
Despite his campy and flamboyant television persona, Lynde&#x27;s private life and sexual orientation were not directly acknowledged or discussed on television or in other media during his lifetime. According to an essay on the website for The Biography Channel, in the 1970s, entertainment journalists did not investigate the private lives of performers who were best known as game show regulars.

A 1976 &quot;People&quot; magazine article on Lynde included text about Stan Finesmith, who was described as Lynde&#x27;s hairstylist, &quot;suite mate&quot;, and &quot;chauffeur-bodyguard&quot;. The magazine included one photograph of Lynde as Finesmith styled his hair. During Lynde&#x27;s lifetime, this was as close as the media came to hinting at his homosexuality. Cathy Rudolph, a friend of Lynde who published a 2013 book &quot;Paul Lynde: A BiographyHis Life, His Love(s) and His Laughter&quot;, stated in a 2018 interview that &quot;being gay and having to hide it frustrated him.&quot;

With the wealth Lynde had earned working on &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;, he bought Errol Flynn″s Hollywood mansion and spent an enormous amount of money on renovations and décor. He lived there with his beloved dog, Harry MacAfee, until Harry died in 1977. Afterward, Lynde could not stay in the house without him and later bought a new home.

Lynde suffered from weight problems, weighing when he graduated from high school. He was honored by Weight Watchers in 1977.

=== Struggles with alcohol ===
Lynde struggled with alcoholism and had numerous run-ins with the law, including frequent arrests for public intoxication. Peter Marshall and Kaye Ballard confirmed that Lynde, when inebriated, became very cruel, sometimes violent, and would sometimes ridicule his friends.

On July 18, 1965, Lynde was involved in an incident in which a friend, another young actor, accidentally fell to his death from the window of their hotel room in San Francisco&#x27;s Sir Francis Drake Hotel. Lynde and 24-year-old James &quot;Bing&quot; Davidson had been drinking for hours when Davidson, while &quot;horsing around&quot;, according to an Associated Press report, slipped and fell eight stories.

In October 1977, Lynde was involved in an incident at his alma mater, Northwestern University, when he was the Grand Marshal for homecoming. At a fast food restaurant near the campus after the homecoming parade, he made racist remarks and gestures to black NU professor JamesP. Pitts. Lynde blamed his behavior on fatigue and inebriation.

In January 1978, while in Salt Lake City to record a segment for the TV variety show &quot;Donny &amp; Marie&quot;, Lynde was arrested outside a tavern and charged with interfering with a police officer. Lynde&#x27;s vehicle had been broken into and his valuables stolen while he was inside the tavern. The arresting officer had been investigating a different car burglary and claimed Lynde kept insisting that he &quot;attend to Lynde&#x27;s complaint&quot; instead. The complaint was later dropped.

Determined to get his life back on track, Lynde became sober and drug-free in early 1980.

== Death ==
On January 10, 1982, after Lynde failed to attend a birthday celebration, his friend, actor/model Paul Barresi, became concerned. When Barresi and another friend, actor Dean Dittman, could not get an answer after calling Lynde on the phone and knocking on Lynde&#x27;s door, Barresi broke into the side entrance to Lynde&#x27;s home in Beverly Hills, California, and found Lynde dead in his bed in the early morning hours of January 11, 1982. Lynde was 55 years old.

Stories circulated suggesting that Lynde had a visitor at the time of his death who fled the scene, but evidence indicated the stories were false. Lynde regularly activated his house alarm before retiring for the evening. When Barresi broke in, the alarm blared, indicating that Lynde had been alone at the time of his death and that Lynde had died in his sleep. Contrary to other reports that Lynde was found naked, Barresi said, &quot;Not so. Paul was in his pajamas and wearing a robe.&quot;

The coroner ruled the death was caused by a heart attack. Lynde&#x27;s cremated remains are interred at Amity Cemetery, in Amity, Knox County, Ohio, next to those of his brother Johnny and his sister Helen. His mother, father, and veteran brother, Coradon, are buried at the same cemetery.

== Legacy ==
A biography was published in 2005, titled &quot;Center Square: The Paul Lynde Story&quot;. Authors Steve Wilson and Joe Florenski described Lynde as &quot;Liberace without a piano&quot; and that to most 1970s-era viewers, he was &quot;a frustrated bit player and character actor on a daytime game show&quot;. To the homosexual community, his reputation was less than stellar: &quot;In some ways, he came to symbolize what&#x27;s perceived to be a self-loathing era for gay culture.&quot;

Lynde&#x27;s distinctive vocal delivery has also been widely imitated:
* Cartoon creator/voice actor Seth MacFarlane has acknowledged that the voice of Roger the Alien on &quot;American Dad!&quot; was modeled after Lynde.
* Actor/comedian Michael Airington portrays Lynde in the show &quot;Oh My Goodness It&#x27;s Paul Lynde&quot; and &quot;An Evening with Paul Lynde&quot;, recreating Lynde&#x27;s 1976 live show and &quot;Off Center: The Paul Lynde Show&quot;. Airington licensed the rights from the Paul Lynde Estate following a copyright claim. He also sang the theme of &quot;Samurai Pizza Cats&quot; in an impersonated Paul Lynde voice.
* Steve Carell&#x27;s portrayal of Uncle Arthur in the 2005 film version of &quot;Bewitched&quot; is done as an impression of Lynde.
* Veteran voice actor and Skywalker Sound editor David Acord used an impression of Lynde&#x27;s distinctive speech pattern for the portrayal of the droid EV-A4-D in an episode of &quot;Star Wars: The Clone Wars&quot;.
* In 2018, drag queen BenDeLaCreme won the &quot;Snatch Game&quot; episode of the third season of &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race All Stars&quot; with a portrayal of Lynde.
* In July 2020, it was announced that actor and comedian Billy Eichner and producer Tom McNulty were developing a biopic based on the life of Lynde entitled &quot;Man in the Box&quot;, with Eichner set to star as Lynde.
* Richard Squires&#x27; 2018 experimental documentary &quot;Doozy&quot; examines Lynde&#x27;s queer-coded voice work as a Hanna-Barbera cartoon villain.

<text>Hollywood Squares (originally The Hollywood Squares, later stylized as H2: Hollywood Squares) is an American game show in which two contestants compete in a game of tic-tac-toe to win cash and prizes. The show originally aired as a pilot on NBC in 1965, and debuted on NBC as a regular series in October 1966. The board for the game is a 3 × 3 vertical stack of open-faced cubes, each occupied by a celebrity seated at a desk facing the contestants. The stars are asked questions by the host and the contestants judge the truth of their answers to gain squares in the right pattern to win the game.

Though &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; was a legitimate game show, the game largely acted as the background for the show&#x27;s comedy in the form of joke answers (commonly called &quot;zingers&quot; by the production staff), often given by the stars prior to their real answer. The show&#x27;s writers usually supplied the jokes. In addition, the stars were given the questions&#x27; subjects and bluffs prior to the show. The show was scripted in this sense, but the gameplay was not. The original host Peter Marshall explained at the beginning of the Secret Square game, &quot;the celebrities were briefed before the show to help them with bluff answers, but they are hearing the actual questions for the first time.&quot;

Marshall hosted the original version of &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; that aired on NBC from 1966 to 1980, as well as a nighttime syndicated version that ran from 1971 to 1981. It then returned to NBC in 1983 as part of a 60-minute hybrid series with &quot;Match Game&quot;, featuring Jon Bauman hosting the &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; portion of that show. Following Marshall&#x27;s retirement, the show has since been revived twice in syndication: a version hosted by John Davidson from 1986 to 1989, and another hosted by Tom Bergeron from 1998 to 2004. Three revivals were run in the 2010s with a different title all on Paramount cable channels; in 2012, &quot;Hip Hop Squares&quot; on MTV2 with Peter Rosenberg, and from 2017 to 2019 on VH1 with DeRay Davis, in 2019, &quot;Nashville Squares&quot; on CMT with Bob Saget, and in 2023, &quot;Celebrity Squares&quot; on VH1 with John &quot;DC Young Fly&quot; Whitfield.

In 2013, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked it at No. 7 in its list of the 60 greatest game shows ever. Internationally, there have been multiple versions produced under a variety of names (see International versions below). When combined with two spinoffs of the franchise, the show has been produced for seven different decades.

In May 2024, it was announced that the show would be revived by CBS (which has owned the rights to the program since 2000, when it acquired format owner King World), with Drew Barrymore as a co-executive producer and center square, and Nate Burleson as host. The series premiered on January 16, 2025. On February 24, 2025, the revival was renewed for a second season.

==Basic rules==
Though there have been variations in the rules and prizes of the game, certain aspects have still remained consistent throughout the series. Two contestants compete in every match, with one representing the letter X and another the letter O (referred to as &quot;circle&quot;) in a game of tic-tac-toe. The tic-tac-toe board features nine celebrities, each seated behind one square of a three-by-three grid game board.

Taking turns, each contestant selects a square. The celebrity in that square is asked a question and gives an answer, typically preceded by a comedic response known as a &quot;zinger&quot;. The contestant may then choose to agree or disagree with the answer given by the celebrity. Correctly agreeing or disagreeing awards the contestant&#x27;s respective symbol, while doing so incorrectly awards the opponent&#x27;s symbol, unless doing so would result in an automatic win for the opponent. As in the regular game of tic-tac-toe, the objective is to create three in a row of the same symbol vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. Should a game develop in such a way that it is impossible to achieve three in a row, the round is won by whichever contestant is able to place their letter in at least five squares (a majority of the board).

==1966–1981==

Bert Parks hosted the 1965 pilot of &quot;Hollywood Squares,&quot; which was taped at CBS Television City. A second pilot was taped with comedian Sandy Baron as host. Neither Parks nor Baron were considered to host the series, partly because NBC was &quot;looking for a complete non-entity&quot;, and partly because Baron was considered &quot;too New Yorky&quot;. NBC acquired the rights to the show, which debuted on October 17, 1966, with Peter Marshall as host, a job he held for 15 years. Marshall agreed to host because he did not want rival Dan Rowan to host. &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; was the final addition to a short-lived game show powerhouse block on NBC, which for the next two years also included &quot;Concentration&quot;, &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;, &quot;You Don&#x27;t Say!&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot;, &quot;Match Game&quot; and others. During most of its daytime run, NBC broadcast &quot;The Hollywood Squares&quot; at 11:30 a.m. Eastern/10:30 a.m. Central; it dominated the ratings until 1976 when it made the first of several time slot moves. The daytime show aired its 3,536th and last episode on June 20, 1980, when it was canceled to make way for a talk show with David Letterman that would become a precursor to his &quot;Late Night&quot; and &quot;Late Show&quot; programs.

The show also ran at night, first on NBC from January 12 to September 13, 1968, as a mid-season replacement for the short-lived sitcom &quot;Accidental Family&quot;. A nighttime syndicated program ran from November 1, 1971, until May 22, 1981. Initially airing once weekly, the syndicated &quot;Squares&quot; added a second airing in 1972 and began airing daily or nightly in September 1980, the show&#x27;s final season. 

The daytime series was played as a best two-out-of-three match between a returning champion and an opponent, with each game worth $200/$400 per match (originally $100 for each game and an additional $300 for the match that totaled $500). Originally, a five-match champion retired with an additional $2,500, the Secret Square prize package (if not yet won), and a new car; the cash bonus was increased through the years. By 1976, the prize for a five-day champion included additional cash ($5,000 or $10,000), two new cars, and a luxury vacation, with a total value of somewhere between $20,000 and $25,000. In September 1976, an endgame was added after each match with the champion simply selecting a star, each of whom held an envelope with a prize; the top prize was $5,000, with additional prizes ranging from small kitchen appliances to items worth up to about $2,000.

The nighttime versions featured the same two contestants playing for the entire half-hour with each completed game worth $300 (NBC prime time) or $250 (syndicated). On the syndicated version, if time ran out with a game still in progress (interrupted by a loud horn that the host called &quot;the tacky buzzer&quot;), each X or O on the board at that point was worth an additional $50 to the contestants, with each contestant guaranteed at least $100 in total winnings. The contestant with the most money at the end of the show won a bonus prize, which for the first seven years of the syndicated series was a car. From 1978 to 1980, the endgame described above was used with each prize worth at least $5,000 including a new car; cash prizes of $5,000 and $10,000 were also available. If the match ended in a tie, one final question was played with the star of one contestant&#x27;s choosing; if the contestant agreed or disagreed correctly, he/she won the match; otherwise, the match went to the opponent. The nighttime syndicated version&#x27;s episodes were self-contained, unlike the daytime version where games could straddle.

For the final (1980–1981) season, the syndicated series left NBC&#x27;s Burbank, California studio and moved to the Riviera Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada. During the final season, games were no longer scored. Instead, the winner of each game won a prize, and if time ran out before a game could be completed, the prize went to the player with the most squares on the board. Additionally, eight of the season&#x27;s winning contestants were invited back to play in a Grand Championship tournament at the end of the season. The final $100,000 Grand Championship Tournament was played in 1980 and won by Eric Lloyd Scott of Denver, Colorado. Prizes that year included a Geodesic Dome Home from Domes America, a Botany 500 wardrobe, a 50-day cruise on Delta Line, the first Apple II computer system, the original Sony Betamax, a camper trailer, a motorhome and $20,000 in cash.

===Cast of stars===

Many celebrities became recognized as regulars on the show. Some regulars were frequently asked questions pertaining to a certain topic or category. For instance, Paul Lynde was frequently asked questions related to history or relationships, to which he would first respond with a clever zinger to get a laugh (usually a wrong answer but funny joke/punch line) before providing his answer. Cliff Arquette (in character as &quot;Charley Weaver&quot;), a history buff, excelled at American history questions; Rich Little almost always received questions about other celebrities, which allowed him to do an impression of that individual; Wally Cox was also given a lot of celebrity questions for which he usually gave the wrong answer; Roddy McDowall usually gave correct answers about the plays of Shakespeare; Rose Marie often received questions on dating and relationships, playing off her lovelorn comic persona; and Demond Wilson often responded with mock anger to questions that were carefully worded to play upon African-American stereotypes.

Paul Lynde was featured in the tactically important center square throughout most of the show&#x27;s original run. In 1968, after two years on the show, Lynde became the regular center square. Lynde&#x27;s outrageous jokes earned him three daytime Emmy Award nominations in 1972, 1973 and 1974. He left the series after taping the August 20–24, 1979, week of shows and was replaced by Wayland Flowers; Lynde returned when the series relocated to Las Vegas for the 1980–1981 season.

===Secret Square===
The Secret Square game is played as the first game on a given broadcast (or the first complete game, if a show began with a game already in progress) during the daytime series. In this game, a randomly selected Secret Square is shown only to the home audience by the shot of the television camera. A contestant who picked that square during the game won a bonus prize package if they correctly agreed or disagreed with the star. Secret Square prize packages added cash on the daytime edition, which started at around $1,000 for the 1966 episodes; the base amount increased in the later years from 1967 to 1980, by which time a new Secret Square package was worth around $3,500 to $4,500. The package grew daily until won. The question for the star was sealed in a special envelope and was almost always multiple-choice.

For the 1968 NBC primetime series, the first two games were the Secret Square games. One Secret Square offered a trip and the other Secret Square offered a car or occasionally a boat. If not won, the prize offered in the first round carried over to the second round, with a second prize added. If not won in the second round, the Secret Square prize package went unclaimed.

During the first two seasons of the syndicated series (1971–1973), the first two games were Secret Square games, with the prize packages generally worth about $2,500. If no one claimed the prizes offered in the first round, they were carried over to the second round, and if still not won went unclaimed. Beginning in 1973 and ending in 1978, the first three games had a Secret Square, with each game offering different prize packages, usually worth between $2,000 and $7,000. From 1978 to 1980, the Secret Square games were cut to game numbers two and three (the first two games early on). The Secret Square was not used during the 1980–1981 daily syndicated version.

==&quot;Storybook Squares&quot; (1969 &amp; 1976–1977)==
Hosted by Peter Marshall and announced by Kenny Williams, &quot;Storybook Squares&quot;, a children&#x27;s version of &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;, aired briefly on Saturday mornings on NBC from January 4 to August 30, 1969, and featured stars dressed as various fictional characters from television and fairy tales as well as historical figures from the past. NBC later brought the concept back to the daytime series in the 1976–1977 season with a slight retooling, where instead of children playing entire families played.

In an interview with E!&#x27;s &quot;True Hollywood Story&quot; on March 30, 2003 (episode 7.21), Marshall lauded the concept, but lamented that by the time each of the characters was introduced, very little of the show&#x27;s half-hour format was left for actual gameplay.

==&quot;The Match Game-Hollywood Squares Hour&quot; (1983–1984)==
In 1983, several years after Orion Pictures acquired &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; rights owner Filmways, NBC decided to attempt a revival of the series. What resulted was an effort produced by Mark Goodson Productions that combined the &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; program, under license from Orion, with a revival of the Goodson-produced &quot;Match Game&quot;. The 60-minute program was dubbed &quot;The Match Game-Hollywood Squares Hour&quot; and debuted on October 31, 1983, at 3 p.m. Eastern, replacing the Peter Marshall-hosted series &quot;Fantasy&quot;. Jon Bauman (appearing as himself without his &quot;Bowzer&quot; persona from &quot;Sha Na Na&quot;) hosted the &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; portion of the show. The only regular panelist on this version was Gene Rayburn, who reprised his role as host of &quot;Match Game&quot;; he always occupied the lower left square during &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;, which Bauman also occupied during &quot;Match Game&quot; segments. Most of the semi-regulars were previously better known for &quot;Match Game&quot; (only on two weeks of episodes did a regular from the previous &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;, George Gobel, appear on the panel). The announcer for this version was Gene Wood but was also sub-announced by either Rich Jefferies or Johnny Olson.

&quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; was always played as the second (middle) segment of the show, and featured the winner of the &quot;Match Game&quot; match played in the first half of the program playing O and the show&#x27;s returning champion playing X, regardless of the player&#x27;s genders (all other versions had women playing O and men playing X with exceptions, as noted above). This version of &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; saw several different variations on the gameplay. First, the panelists were not given bluff answers or briefed. Second, the questions followed either a multiple-choice or true/false format. Third, for each square a contestant claimed $25 was added to his/her score with each game win starting at $100 for the first and increasing by that amount for subsequent games until time ran out and a winner was declared. In contrast to the original version of the show, players could win games by default if the opposing player incorrectly agreed/disagreed with a celebrity whose square gave the other player a completed row or five-square win. On all other versions of &quot;Squares&quot;, the player had to earn the winning celebrity&#x27;s square on their own. The winner played the Super Match from &quot;Match Game&quot; for a cash prize.

The &quot;Match Game&quot; segment featured six panelists, as it had from 1973 to 1982; for the &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; portion, a third tier was added to the panel seating area, with three more celebrities being introduced to the proceedings at the show&#x27;s midpoint. All nine celebrities could play the Super Match.

&quot;The Match Game-Hollywood Squares Hour&quot; was not a success and NBC announced its cancellation in the spring of 1984, with the final episode airing on July 27, 1984. It was replaced the following Monday with the soap opera &quot;Santa Barbara&quot;, which ran for nine years.

==1986–1989==

Two years after the cancellation of &quot;The Match Game-Hollywood Squares Hour&quot;, a new &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; series was put into production. Referred to throughout its run as &quot;The New Hollywood Squares&quot;, the program debuted on September 15, 1986, and was produced by Century Towers Productions with Rick Rosner serving as executive producer, Ernie De Massa as producer, Paul Ruffino as Location Manager for remote productions, and Orion Television as a distributor (Century Towers was a subdivision of Orion formed to produce game shows, specifically this series and the 1987–88 syndicated revival of &quot;High Rollers&quot;; the name was in reference to the street that Orion was headquartered at the time).

John Davidson, who was a semi-regular panelist on the original &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;, hosted the series. Shadoe Stevens was the announcer for the series and, beginning late in the first season, he also became a regular panelist occupying the bottom center square. Starting with episode #100, Stevens temporarily left the show to film the movie &quot;Traxx&quot;, and his brother Richard took over as announcer; Stevens returned for the final two weeks of the first season and remained until the series&#x27; end. After one season of rotating center squares, former &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; panelist Joan Rivers joined the series as the permanent center square. Comic actor Jim J. Bullock also became the series&#x27; third regular panelist, usually in the upper-left square. All three took turns as guest hosts for Davidson; Howard Stern replaced Stevens as announcer/panelist during his week as host. All music for the program was composed by Stormy Sacks.

The game used the original version&#x27;s rule that games could not be won due to an opponent&#x27;s error. For the first season, each game was worth $500 with a bonus of $100 per square if time ran out in the middle of a game. Beginning in season two, the third and subsequent games were worth $1,000 (or $200 per square). If time had run out with the contestants tied, one more question was asked to one celebrity; if the contestant agreed or disagreed correctly, they won the money for one square and the match. If not, their opponent automatically won. The single-question format was also used on occasions where there was not enough time remaining for a proper third round. The contestant who finished with the most money won the match and went on to the bonus round. Contestants wore name tags on all episodes of this version except for the premiere.

This version lasted three seasons, ending on June 16, 1989. At the end of the final episode, a video clip from the first week of shows was run, introducing the celebrities who had appeared that week. Davidson, the panelists, the audience, and the crew then sang &quot;Happy Trails&quot; under the credits, with the crew members sitting in the squares and holding up signs that displayed their names and titles. The song continued under a montage of audio clips from the show&#x27;s run as everyone faded away and the lights gradually went out, leaving only the squares illuminated, and the credits sequence ended on a freeze frame of balloons being showered onto the stage before the final fade to black.

===Secret Square===
The second game of each show was a Secret Square game. As with the original version, the Secret Square was revealed to the home audience at the start of this game; if a contestant chose that square, a school bell sounded and if the contestant agreed or disagreed correctly, he/she won a prize (usually a trip, if it was won, Davidson would tell the contestant to &quot;Pack your bags!&quot;). The prize did not increase in value from one show to the next if it was not collected.

===Bonus round===
The first two seasons of this version of the series employed a bonus round that was similar to the one used on the 1970s game show &quot;Split Second&quot;. Five cars, each of the same brand/make, were displayed on the stage for the entire week. The champion chose one of five keys in a bowl held by Davidson and then chose the car they thought the key would start. The contestant also chose at least one celebrity to stand beside the car or sit in it with them for good luck; at times the entire panel congregated near the car, especially on Friday shows or when a champion reached a fifth win and automatically retired with the car.

If the chosen key started the car, the contestant won it and retired; otherwise, the contestant returned the next day with that car eliminated should he or she return to the bonus game. After a fifth victory, the contestant automatically won the only car still in play at that point and retired. Every broadcast week started with a new set of five cars; if a champion&#x27;s reign carried over from the preceding week, one car was eliminated for each of his/her victories to that point, in ascending order of price.

For the final season, the champion first chose a car, then one of the nine celebrities. Each held a key; five of them had the correct keys, while the other four had keys that would not start any car. If the champion failed to win the chosen car, it remained available after subsequent victories instead of being eliminated. The five-day limit was removed, allowing champions to remain on this show until they either won a car or were defeated.

==1998–2004==

In 1991, as part of Orion Pictures&#x27; bankruptcy, its intellectual properties were auctioned off. King World Productions bid for and won the rights to the &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; format; six years later, a revival series began development. Whoopi Goldberg was brought in to be the executive producer, with John Moffitt and Pat Tourk Lee as producers. The venture was to be a co-production of Moffitt-Lee Productions and Goldberg&#x27;s One Ho Productions, in association with Columbia TriStar Television and King World, who would also be responsible for distributing the revival; this differed from Columbia-TriStar and King World&#x27;s other collaborations, &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; and &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;, where King World had no stake in production.

On September 14, 1998, the revival debuted with Tom Bergeron, who was also appearing as an anchor on &quot;Good Morning America&quot; at the time, as its host; former Nickelodeon host Marc Summers was also considered. In addition to her production duties, Whoopi Goldberg served as the permanent center square, with series head writer Bruce Vilanch, Gilbert Gottfried, Martin Mull and Caroline Rhea as regular panelists and Brad Garrett, Bobcat Goldthwait, Jeffrey Tambor, George Wallace, Kathy Griffin and various others as semi-regular panelists. Shadoe Stevens returned as an announcer but unlike the previous series, he was not a panelist on this version.

After the 2001–2002 season, Goldberg left the series and Moffitt and Lee were fired. Vilanch also left his writing position and Rhea moved to New York to host &quot;The Caroline Rhea Show&quot;, a daytime variety series launched to replace &quot;The Rosie O&#x27;Donnell Show&quot;; O&#x27;Donnell had decided to leave her namesake show before the end of the 2001–02 season and Rhea, who was chosen by O&#x27;Donnell to be her replacement, served as guest host for most of the last season. Stevens also left his role as announcer.

The 2002–2003 season launched with Henry Winkler and his production partner Michael Levitt as the new executive producers and Jeffrey Tambor as the announcer (in addition to retaining his semi-regular appearance). Winkler guest announced for several weeks during the season. Some changes were made to the overall production with the show adopting a new logo that referred to the show as &quot;H2&quot;. The set was given a new makeover where the contestant desks were replaced with podiums with LED screens inside and a rewritten version of the Teena Marie song &quot;Square Biz&quot; became the theme song.

After Goldberg&#x27;s departure, at first, the show did not feature a traditional permanent center square. Instead, a new celebrity was in the center square each week. Ellen DeGeneres, Alec Baldwin and Simon Cowell were among those who played center square, as well as Peter Marshall, who appeared during a special theme week in 2002. Martin Mull was eventually chosen as the permanent center square for the 2003–2004 season (though some guests continued to appear as center square during a few theme weeks of that season).

For most of the first five seasons of this &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; series, the first and second games were worth $1,000 to the winner. The third game was worth $2,000, and every subsequent game until time ran out was worth $4,000. If a contestant did not win anything in the main game, $500 was given to them as a consolation prize. In the early episodes of the first season, contestants only played for half the money; $500 was won for each of the first two games, with $1,000 for the third and $2,000 for all subsequent games, and $250 was given as a consolation prize for failing to win a game. The consolation prize amount also was used for each contestant&#x27;s square if time ran out during a game and was counted towards their cash total to determine the day&#x27;s champion.

The tiebreaker was the same as the previous versions except that the contestant who had won the most games, most squares overall, or won the last game played (whichever came first) had the option to play the question or pass it to his/her opponent, with a miss by either contestant giving their opponent the win by default.

For the first season of this &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; series, two new contestants competed on each episode. A coin toss determined who would begin the first game during this time. Beginning in the second season, the returning champion rule was reinstated; a contestant could stay on for a maximum of five days. With this change, the incoming challenger began the first game of a match. The show ended on June 4, 2004.

===Secret Square===
The first season also saw up to two Secret Square games. In the earliest episodes of the series, two Secret Square games were played on each show with a different prize offered for each game. The Secret Square was played in both the second and third games of the day, but after two weeks the Secret Square prize only carried over to the third game if neither contestant had claimed it by the second game. From the second season forward, the Secret Square was only played in the second game.

Beginning in the second season and continuing until the end of the fifth season, the Secret Square game was played for an accumulating jackpot of prizes that Bergeron referred to as the &quot;Secret Square stash&quot;. A new prize was added to the jackpot each day until someone claimed it.

===Bonus round===
The Bergeron &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; employed three different bonus games during its six seasons on air.

====First version====
Originally, the show used the same &quot;pick a star, win a prize&quot; format the Marshall version had used during its last few years on the air. Each of the nine squares hid a different prize, with $10,000 cash ($15,000 in season 3) and a car being the two most expensive. The day&#x27;s winner simply picked the celebrity they wanted and won whatever prize was in an envelope that the star was holding. As noted by Bergeron at the start of the bonus round for each episode, the prizes totaled over $100,000.

Beginning partway through the first season and continuing until partway through season four, the champion could only win the prize by correctly agreeing/disagreeing with the response that the chosen celebrity gave to a Secret Square-style question. A champion who failed to do so was awarded a consolation prize of $2,500 cash in the first season; this award was dropped once returning champions were reinstated in the second season. However, during theme weeks in which contestants only played once, the $2,500 was given for a miss.

====Big money round====
Beginning approximately two months into season four and continuing until the end of that season in June 2002, &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; instituted a new high-stakes round in response to the recent trend of quiz shows offering big cash prizes.

The champion faced a general knowledge trivia round with their choice of any of the nine celebrities. Again, each of the celebrities held envelopes with varying dollar amounts hidden inside, ranging from $1,000 to $5,000 (increments of $500). If the champion picked a square that contained more than one person, the champion selected only one person from that square. The champion was given 60 seconds to answer as many multiple-choice questions as possible and was allowed to consult their celebrity partner for help; however, only the champion&#x27;s answers were accepted. Each correct answer was worth the amount in the envelope, which was revealed at the start of the round.

At the end of the 60 seconds, the champion was given a choice to either quit with the money earned in the round or attempt to go double-or-nothing on an open-ended final question, with the category given to the contestant before he/she decided to play on.

====Keys====
As part of the overhaul done for the 5th season of &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;, a new bonus round was conceived. Taking a cue from the 1980s syndicated series, the round involved contestants using keys to try to win prizes.

To start the round, a 30-second speed round was played. One at a time, the champion chose a celebrity and Bergeron would read a statement about them. The champion had to either agree or disagree with the statement.

Once the 30 seconds were up, Bergeron and the champion moved from the contestant area to the stage floor where the day&#x27;s prize awaited. For each correct answer the champion gave in the speed round, one key was blacked out on a grid of nine. After the speed round, the champion chose one of the remaining keys. If the key performed the desired action, the champion won the prize.

If the champion did not win the prize on a particular show, he/she received $1,000 for each correct answer given during the speed round as a consolation prize. For each subsequent attempt on winning the same prize, one free key was blacked out at the outset of the round.

Once the champion won a prize, a new prize would be available for him/her to try for if he/she returned to the bonus round the next day. The procedure for each new prize was the same.

For season five, the prize levels and the methods to win them were as follows:
* 1st win: Car (To win, the selected key had to start its engine.)
* 2nd: $25,000 cash (To win, the selected key had to unlock a safe containing the money.)
* 3rd: Luxury vacation or a trip around the world, worth $20,000–$30,000 (To win, the selected key had to open a steamer trunk.)
* 4th: $50,000 cash (To win, the safe needed to be unlocked.)
* 5th: $100,000 cash (To win, the safe needed to be unlocked.)

On occasion, a gift certificate to an upscale merchant was placed inside the safe instead of the designated cash prize. This was usually done for special theme weeks or tournaments.

Also, for theme weeks, each match&#x27;s winner would have one extra key removed at the start of the round since they would only play once.

===Final season changes===
For the 6th and last season of &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;, more changes were made to the series. First, John Moschitta Jr. replaced Jeffrey Tambor as the announcer and Bruce Vilanch returned to the series as an occasional panelist. Second, the game format was scrapped in favor of returning to the best-two-of-three match format last seen on the NBC series in 1980. Each game was worth $1,000 and the first player to win the necessary two games won the match. The Secret Square was still played during the second game but the accumulating jackpot of prizes was discarded in favor of playing for one prize per match, regardless of whether or not the previous match&#x27;s prize was won. Third, the format change resulted in the show no longer being self-contained, as matches could and often did straddle episodes.

The bonus round format from the previous season remained but with several changes. All nine keys were in play every time a contestant played the bonus round regardless of whether he/she had won the prize in the previous round or not. Each correct answer in the first half of the round was now worth $500 if the prize is not won.

The prize structure was also changed, with the objectives the same as noted above. The new structure was as follows:

*1st win: Vacation (worth approximately $10,000)
*2nd win: $10,000 cash 
*3rd win: Luxury car (worth approximately $40,000)
*4th win: $25,000 cash
*5th win: Trip around the world

Season 6 theme weeks used the game format from the first five seasons, with each match played to time and the bonus round serving as the final segment. The winners of these matches played the bonus round for $10,000 cash or a car, and had one key eliminated at the outset before eliminating any additional keys.

==&quot;Hip Hop Squares&quot; (2012, 2017–2019)==

&quot;Hip Hop Squares&quot; aired on MTV2 from May 22, 2012, until December 18, 2012, and was hosted by Peter Rosenberg; while the announcer was DJ Ms. Nix (a.k.a. Nicole Lyn). The show returned five years later on VH1 and was hosted by DeRay Davis (who was previously a panelist in the original MTV2 version) while the announcer was executive producer Ice Cube. The second edition ran from May 13, 2017, until September 17, 2019. While the MTV2 version played much like the original, the VH1 version featured celebrities as contestants playing for a member of the studio audience.

==&quot;The West Virginia Squares&quot; (2014)==
From June 23–24, 2014 as part of an event called &quot;FestivAll&quot;; a one-off limited live stage version dubbed &quot;The West Virginia Squares&quot; streamed on local television station WVPB&#x27;s official YouTube channel and on wvpublic.org in West Virginia only. Hosted by the original &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; host (and local native) Peter Marshall reprising his role while the announcer was Bob Brunner. The trivia questions were mainly focused on the music and history of its state, for only four episodes were taped at the Clay Center. The celebrities that were seen in this version were: Larry Groce, Landau Eugene Murphy Jr., Bil Lepp, Donnie Davidson, Charlie McCoy, Autumn Blair, Joyce DeWitt (also a local West Virginia native), Charisse Hailsop, Danny Jones, Steve Bishop, Billy Edd Wheeler, and Michael Cerveris. DeWitt was also a panelist on the original version and (like Marshall) was a West Virginia native. No bonus round was played.

==&quot;Nashville Squares&quot; (2019)==
A country music themed version called &quot;Nashville Squares&quot; hosted by Bob Saget aired on CMT from November 1 until November 29, 2019. Similarly to &quot;Hip Hop Squares&quot; (2017 version), celebrities played for a member of the studio audience.

==&quot;Hollywood Museum Squares&quot; (2021)==
In 2021, The Hollywood Museum announced a limited-run revival of the series as a fundraiser for the organization. Dubbed &quot;Hollywood Museum Squares&quot;, each episode is introduced by Marshall and announced by Shadoe Stevens and Harvey (One Episode), with Davidson, Bergeron, Vilanch, Pat Finn and Marc Summers each hosting one of the episodes. The panelists for the game included Loni Anderson, Alison Arngrim, Rico E. Anderson, Gilbert Gottfried, Rich Little, Glenn Scarpelli, Jerry Mathers, Donna Mills, Judy Tenuta and Lindsay Wagner, among others.
All participants appeared via videoconferencing over a 3D computer simulation of the 1986-89 set designed by Dustin James.

Writers included Louis Virtel from &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; and Jason Antoniewicz, a writer from &quot;Match Game&quot;, &quot;College Bowl&quot; and &quot;Tug of Words&quot;, to name a few.

The programs were directed by Steve Grant and Bob Loudin, who directed many television programs including the Davidson &quot;Squares&quot;.

John Ricci Jr. and Philip Berman served as the executive producers.

==&quot;Celebrity Squares&quot; (2023)==
On September 25, 2023, it was announced that a Black culture-themed version called &quot;Celebrity Squares&quot;, hosted by D.C. Young Fly (who was a frequent panelist on the 2017 version of &quot;Hip Hop Squares&quot;), would premiere on VH1 on October 17, 2023.

==CBS revival (2025)==
On May 2, 2024, CBS announced that it had greenlit a new version of &quot;Hollywood Squares,&quot; scheduled to premiere in January 2025 as part of its midseason lineup. Actress Drew Barrymore serves as a co-executive producer, and will also serve as the center square. On June 11, 2024, Nate Burleson was announced as host. Originally scheduled to premiere on January 9, 2025, the premiere was delayed to January 16, 2025, being seen as sensitive due to the ongoing wildfires in Los Angeles and surrounding areas. CBS also scheduled an episode to air after its coverage of an NFL divisional playoff game on January 19. On January 27, 2025, the Burleson version temporarily replaced reruns of &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; until January 31, 2025 in order to air its new soap opera &quot;Beyond the Gates&quot; taking its place in daytime.

On February 24, 2025, the revival was renewed for a second season.

==Home versions and merchandise==
Watkins-Strathmore produced the first two home versions of the show in 1967. Both versions featured a game board that allowed for writing in the celebrities&#x27; names under each square (using crayon, soft lead pencil, or a similar wipe-off medium). Each version included four decks of 45 question cards, one of which was marked with asterisks as the &quot;Secret Square&quot; question, which earned the player an extra $100 if answered correctly. Rules allowed for a 3-game match to be played, with $200 awarded for each game (just as the daytime rules specified).

Ideal issued a version of the game in 1974 with a picture of Peter Marshall on the box. Marshall was the original host of the television version throughout its entire first run. This was the first of the adaptations to feature humorous names for the celebrities. A similar board game based on the UK version under the title &quot;Celebrity Squares&quot; was released by Buckingham Toys five years later in 1979 with a picture of host Bob Monkhouse on the cover. It did not specify a &quot;Secret Square&quot; rule. Matches were best two-out-of-three with no money awards specified.

Also in 1974, Event Records released a compilation album entitled &quot;Zingers from The Hollywood Squares&quot; (along with two companion books) on vinyl LP and cassette, containing the audio of what were considered to be some of the show&#x27;s funniest moments. A CD of the album was included in Peter Marshall&#x27;s 2002 book &quot;Backstage with the Original Hollywood Square&quot;.

Milton Bradley produced two home versions, first in 1980 with a game loosely based on the Marshall version, then in 1986 for the Davidson version, with a 3-D board and twelve &quot;celebrities&quot; to insert into the board. Both versions specified that there was no &quot;Secret Square&quot; rule, and like the Ideal version, matches were best two-out-of-three with no money awards specified.

Parker Brothers released a similar 3-D board/12 celebrity inserts version in 1999, based on the Bergeron version. Early printings did not specify a &quot;Secret Square&quot; rule, but this was later revised so that every question card with a number ending in &quot;5&quot; was a &quot;Secret Square&quot; question worth $1,000 in bonus cash. Games were played until one player/team won $5,000. Alternate rules allowed for timed play (suggesting a 30-minute &quot;as if you were on TV&quot; game), with the player/team ahead once time expired being declared the winner.

GameTek released a version of &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; in 1988 for MS-DOS, Commodore 64, and Apple II computers and later for the Nintendo Entertainment System based on the Davidson version. In 1999, Tiger Electronics released an electronic LCD handheld game based on the Bergeron version. In 2002, the official &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; website had an online version of the show using the celebrities that were on that week. In 2010, Ludia released their version of &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; for the PC, Wii, iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch and on PlayStation 3&#x27;s PSN downloadable service from November 15, 2011; the games were based upon the 2002–2004 format and featured the voice of host Tom Bergeron and video clips of celebrities Brad Garrett, Kathy Griffin, Jeffrey Tambor and Martin Mull as the center square.

==Episode status and reruns==
Of the over 3,000 episodes of the original series, &quot;no one has an exact count&quot; of how many still exist. A substantial number, mostly from the daytime run, may have been destroyed in accordance with NBC policy of the era.

Game Show Network previously reran a package of 130 episodes from Marshall&#x27;s hosting run, the majority of which came from the syndication run during the 1970s. At least 13 episodes from the 1968 NBC primetime run are also known to have been part of the Game Show Network rerun package. It was noted at the time that substantially more Marshall episodes than the 130 that GSN aired are believed to exist, but for a number of reasons (including political correctness concerns and personality rights clearance issues) have never been rerun. UCLA has a handful of NBC daytime episodes in their film and television archive.

The &quot;Match Game-Hollywood Squares Hour&quot; episodes exist in their entirety and have been airing on the digital television network Buzzr, which is owned by Fremantle (the successor in interest to Mark Goodson Productions) since 2019.

The 1986–1989 syndicated series aired as part of USA Network&#x27;s afternoon game show rerun package from September 11, 1989, to June 25, 1993. This version has not been seen on television since USA stopped airing them.

The 1998 syndicated series has been rerun on Game Show Network in the past, and every season except one (including the final season) has been carried by the network over the years. Episodes were also rerun on GameTV in Canada. In July 2023, a &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; channel was added to Pluto TV, featuring episodes from the final two Bergeron seasons.

<text>The Tower of Hanoi (also called The problem of Benares Temple, Tower of Brahma or Lucas&#x27; Tower, and sometimes pluralized as Towers, or simply pyramid puzzle) is a mathematical game or puzzle consisting of three rods and a number of disks of various diameters, which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle begins with the disks stacked on one rod in order of decreasing size, the smallest at the top, thus approximating a conical shape. The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to one of the other rods, obeying the following rules:

# Only one disk may be moved at a time.
# Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
# No disk may be placed on top of a disk that is smaller than it.

With three disks, the puzzle can be solved in seven moves. The minimal number of moves required to solve a Tower of Hanoi puzzle is , where &quot;n&quot; is the number of disks.

== Origins ==
The puzzle was invented by the French mathematician Édouard Lucas, first presented in 1883 as a game discovered by &quot;N. Claus (de Siam)&quot; (an anagram of &quot;Lucas d&#x27;Amiens&quot;), and later published as a booklet in 1889 and in a posthumously-published volume of Lucas&#x27; &quot;Récréations mathématiques&quot;. Accompanying the game was an instruction booklet, describing the game&#x27;s purported origins in Tonkin, and claiming that according to legend Brahmins at a temple in Benares have been carrying out the movement of the &quot;Sacred Tower of Brahma&quot;, consisting of sixty-four golden disks, according to the same rules as in the game, and that the completion of the tower would lead to the end of the world. Numerous variations on this legend exist, regarding the ancient and mystical nature of the puzzle.

If the legend were true, and if the priests were able to move disks at a rate of one per second, using the smallest number of moves, it would take them 264 − 1 seconds or roughly 585 billion years to finish, which is about 42 times the estimated current age of the universe.

There are many variations on this legend. For instance, in some back stories, the temple is a monastery, and the priests are monks. The temple or monastery may be in various locales including Hanoi, and may be associated with any religion. In some versions, other elements are introduced, such as the fact that the tower was created at the beginning of the world, or that the priests or monks may make only one move per day.

== Solution ==
The puzzle can be played with any number of disks, although many toy versions have around 7 to 9 of them. The minimal number of moves required to solve a Tower of Hanoi puzzle with &quot;n&quot; disks is .

=== Iterative solution ===

A simple solution for the toy puzzle is to alternate moves between the smallest piece and a non-smallest piece. When moving the smallest piece, always move it to the next position in the same direction (to the right if the starting number of pieces is even, to the left if the starting number of pieces is odd). If there is no tower position in the chosen direction, move the piece to the opposite end, but then continue to move in the correct direction. For example, if you started with three pieces, you would move the smallest piece to the opposite end, then continue in the left direction after that. When the turn is to move the non-smallest piece, there is only one legal move. Doing this will complete the puzzle in the fewest moves.

==== Simpler statement of iterative solution ====

The iterative solution is equivalent to repeated execution of the following sequence of steps until the goal has been achieved:
* Move one disk from peg A to peg B or vice versa, whichever move is legal.
* Move one disk from peg A to peg C or vice versa, whichever move is legal.
* Move one disk from peg B to peg C or vice versa, whichever move is legal.
Following this approach, the stack will end up on peg B if the number of disks is odd and peg C if it is even.

=== Recursive solution ===
The key to solving a problem recursively is to recognize that it can be broken down into a collection of smaller sub-problems, to each of which &quot;that same general solving procedure that we are seeking&quot; applies, and the total solution is then found in some &quot;simple&quot; way from those sub-problems&#x27; solutions. Each of these created sub-problems being &quot;smaller&quot; guarantees that the base case(s) will eventually be reached. For the Towers of Hanoi:
* label the pegs A, B, C,
* let &quot;n&quot; be the total number of disks, and
* number the disks from 1 (smallest, topmost) to &quot;n&quot; (largest, bottom-most).

Assuming all &quot;n&quot; disks are distributed in valid arrangements among the pegs; assuming there are &quot;m&quot; top disks on a &quot;source&quot; peg, and all the rest of the disks are larger than &quot;m&quot;, so they can be safely ignored; to move &quot;m&quot; disks from a source peg to a &quot;target&quot; peg using a &quot;spare&quot; peg, without violating the rules:
# Move &quot;m&quot; − 1 disks from the source to the spare peg, by &quot;the same general solving procedure&quot;. Rules are not violated, by assumption. This leaves the disk &quot;m&quot; as a top disk on the source peg.
# Move the disk &quot;m&quot; from the source to the target peg, which is guaranteed to be a valid move, by the assumptions — &quot;a simple step&quot;.
# Move the &quot;m&quot; − 1 disk that we have just placed on the spare, from the spare to the target peg by &quot;the same general solving procedure&quot;, so they are placed on top of the disk &quot;m&quot; without violating the rules.
# The base case is to move &quot;0&quot; disks (in steps 1 and 3), that is, do nothing—which does not violate the rules.

The full Tower of Hanoi solution then moves &quot;n&quot; disks from the source peg A to the target peg C, using B as the spare peg.

This approach can be given a rigorous mathematical proof with mathematical induction and is often used as an example of recursion when teaching programming.

==== Logical analysis of the recursive solution ====
As in many mathematical puzzles, finding a solution is made easier by solving a slightly more general problem: how to move a tower of &quot;h&quot; (height) disks from a starting peg &quot;f&quot; = A (from) onto a destination peg &quot;t&quot; = C (to), B being the remaining third peg and assuming &quot;t&quot; ≠ &quot;f&quot;. First, observe that the problem is symmetric for permutations of the names of the pegs (symmetric group &quot;S&quot;3). If a solution is known moving from peg A to peg C, then, by renaming the pegs, the same solution can be used for every other choice of starting and destination peg. If there is only one disk (or even none at all), the problem is trivial. If &quot;h&quot; = 1, then move the disk from peg A to peg C. If &quot;h&quot; &gt; 1, then somewhere along the sequence of moves, the largest disk must be moved from peg A to another peg, preferably to peg C. The only situation that allows this move is when all smaller &quot;h&quot; − 1 disks are on peg B. Hence, first all &quot;h&quot; − 1 smaller disks must go from A to B. Then move the largest disk and finally move the &quot;h&quot; − 1 smaller disks from peg B to peg C. The presence of the largest disk does not impede any move of the &quot;h&quot; − 1 smaller disks and can be temporarily ignored. Now the problem is reduced to moving &quot;h&quot; − 1 disks from one peg to another one, first from A to B and subsequently from B to C, but the same method can be used both times by renaming the pegs. The same strategy can be used to reduce the &quot;h&quot; − 1 problem to &quot;h&quot; − 2, &quot;h&quot; − 3, and so on until only one disk is left. This is called recursion. This algorithm can be schematized as follows.

Identify the disks in order of increasing size by the natural numbers from 0 up to but not including &quot;h&quot;. Hence disk 0 is the smallest one, and disk &quot;h&quot; − 1 the largest one.

The following is a procedure for moving a tower of &quot;h&quot; disks from a peg A onto a peg C, with B being the remaining third peg:
# If &quot;h&quot; &gt; 1, then first use this procedure to move the &quot;h&quot; − 1 smaller disks from peg A to peg B.
# Now the largest disk, i.e. disk &quot;h&quot; can be moved from peg A to peg C.
# If &quot;h&quot; &gt; 1, then again use this procedure to move the &quot;h&quot; − 1 smaller disks from peg B to peg C.

By mathematical induction, it is easily proven that the above procedure requires the minimum number of moves possible and that the produced solution is the only one with this minimal number of moves. Using recurrence relations, the exact number of moves that this solution requires can be calculated by: formula_1. This result is obtained by noting that steps 1 and 3 take formula_2 moves, and step 2 takes one move, giving formula_3.

==== Non-recursive solution ====

The list of moves for a tower being carried from one peg onto another one, as produced by the recursive algorithm, has many regularities. When counting the moves starting from 1, the ordinal of the disk to be moved during move &quot;m&quot; is the number of times &quot;m&quot; can be divided by 2. Hence every odd move involves the smallest disk. It can also be observed that the smallest disk traverses the pegs &quot;f&quot;, &quot;t&quot;, &quot;r&quot;, &quot;f&quot;, &quot;t&quot;, &quot;r&quot;, etc. for odd height of the tower and traverses the pegs &quot;f&quot;, &quot;r&quot;, &quot;t&quot;, &quot;f&quot;, &quot;r&quot;, &quot;t&quot;, etc. for even height of the tower. This provides the following algorithm, which is easier, carried out by hand, than the recursive algorithm.

In alternate moves:
* Move the smallest disk to the peg it has not recently come from.
* Move another disk legally (there will be only one possibility).
For the very first move, the smallest disk goes to peg &quot;t&quot; if &quot;h&quot; is odd and to peg &quot;r&quot; if &quot;h&quot; is even.

Also observe that:
* Disks whose ordinals have even parity move in the same sense as the smallest disk.
* Disks whose ordinals have odd parity move in opposite sense.
* If &quot;h&quot; is even, the remaining third peg during successive moves is &quot;t&quot;, &quot;r&quot;, &quot;f&quot;, &quot;t&quot;, &quot;r&quot;, &quot;f&quot;, etc.
* If &quot;h&quot; is odd, the remaining third peg during successive moves is &quot;r&quot;, &quot;t&quot;, &quot;f&quot;, &quot;r&quot;, &quot;t&quot;, &quot;f&quot;, etc.

With this knowledge, a set of disks in the middle of an optimal solution can be recovered with no more state information than the positions of each disk:
* Call the moves detailed above a disk&#x27;s &quot;natural&quot; move.
* Examine the smallest top disk that is not disk 0, and note what its only (legal) move would be: if there is no such disk, then we are either at the first or last move.
* If that move is the disk&#x27;s &quot;natural&quot; move, then the disk has not been moved since the last disk 0 move, and that move should be taken.
* If that move is not the disk&#x27;s &quot;natural&quot; move, then move disk 0.

=== Binary solution ===
Disk positions for an &quot;n&quot;-disk puzzle can be determined directly from the binary representation of the move number, &quot;m&quot;. For example, all the details for move &quot;m&quot;=216 of an 8-disk Tower of Hanoi can be computed without any iteration or recursion, and without reference to any previous moves or distribution of disks. Conversely, given a legal disk distribution, the move number to achieve that distribution can be computed.

Let the disks be labeled &quot;n&quot;, &quot;n&quot;-1,…,1, in decreasing size. Let the pegs A, B, and C be labeled 0, 1, and 2 respectively, with 0 always being the starting peg and 2 always being the ending peg. Further, let the bases for the pegs upon which the disks are stacked be labeled &quot;n&quot;+1, &quot;n&quot;+2, and &quot;n&quot;+3, for pegs 0, 1, and 2 respectively.

The disk positions after move &quot;m&quot; can be mapped from the binary representation of &quot;m&quot; by the following rules:

* There is 1 binary digit (bit) in &quot;m&quot; for each disk.

* The bitstring for &quot;m&quot; is read from left to right, and each bit can be used to map the location of the corresponding disk, from disk &quot;n&quot; to disk 1.
* The most significant (leftmost) bit represents the largest disk, disk &quot;n&quot;. A value of 0 indicates that the largest disk is on the starting peg 0 (A), while a 1 indicates that it is on the final peg 2 (C).
* After any move:

# Each disk is stacked on another disk, or an empty base, in opposite parity order. That is to say: 5&gt;4&gt;3 (3 over 4 over 5) is valid; 5&gt;4&gt;2 (with 2 over 4) is invalid.
# Exactly 1 of the top labels (disk number or empty base) is even (for even &quot;n;&quot; otherwise exactly 1 is odd).
# A bit with the same value as the previous digit means that the corresponding disk is stacked on top of the previous disk. That is to say: a contiguous sequence of 1s or 0s means that the corresponding disks are all on the same peg.

* A bit with a different value than the previous one means that the corresponding disk is on another peg and not on the previous stack. Given 1) above, only 1 choice of the remaining 2 pegs is a legal placement. Note that after the placement of the first set of disks, every “placement round” starts and ends with 1 of the potential pegs having even parity, the other having odd.

For example, in 8-disk Tower of Hanoi:

* Move 0 = 00000000.
** The largest disk (leftmost) bit is 0, so it is on the starting peg (0).
** All other disks are 0 as well, so they are stacked on top of it. Hence all disks are on the starting peg, in the puzzle&#x27;s initial configuration.
* Move 25510 (28 − 1) = 11111111.
** The largest disk bit is 1, so it is on the final peg (2).
** All other disks are 1 as well, so they are stacked on top of it. Hence all disks are on the final peg and the puzzle is solved.
* Move 21610 = 11011000.
** The largest disk bit is 1, so disk 8 is on the final peg (2). Note that it sits on base number 11 (11&gt;8).
** Disk 7 is also 1, so it is stacked on top of disk 8 (11&gt;8&gt;7).
** Disk 6 is 0, so it is on another peg. Peg 1 is empty but its base number is 10. The 6 disk cannot sit on the 10 base (both are even). Therefore disk 6 is placed on peg 0 (9&gt;6).
** Disk 5 is 1, so it is on another peg. Since peg 2 is now topped with 7, it cannot go there. Therefore disk 5 is placed on peg 1 (10&gt;5).
** Disk 4 is also 1, so it is stacked on top of disk 5 (10&gt;5&gt;4).
** Disk 3 is 0, so it is on another peg. Since peg 2 is topped with 7, it cannot go there. Disk 3 is placed on peg 0 (9&gt;6&gt;3).
** Disks 2 and 1 are also 0, so they are stacked on top of disk 3 (9&gt;3&gt;2&gt;1).

The source and destination pegs for the &quot;m&quot;th move (excluding move 0) can be found elegantly from the binary representation of &quot;m&quot; using bitwise operations. To use the syntax of the C programming language, move &quot;m&quot; is:

from pegcodice_1 to peg codice_2.

Another formulation for this is:

from peg codice_3 to peg codice_4. 

These hold for odd &quot;n&quot; puzzles. For even &quot;n&quot; puzzles, the output references to pegs 1 and 2 need to be reversed.

Furthermore, the single disk to be moved for any specific move is determined by the number of times the move count (&quot;m&quot;) can be divided by 2 (i.e. the number consecutive zero bits at the right of &quot;m&quot;), and then adding 1. In the example above for move 216, with 3 right hand 0s, disk 4 (3 + 1) is moved from peg 2 to peg 1.

=== Gray-code solution ===

The binary numeral system of Gray codes gives an alternative way of solving the puzzle. In the Gray system, numbers are expressed in a binary combination of 0s and 1s, but rather than being a standard positional numeral system, the Gray code operates on the premise that each value differs from its predecessor by only one bit changed.

If one counts in Gray code of a bit size equal to the number of disks in a particular Tower of Hanoi, begins at zero and counts up, then the bit changed each move corresponds to the disk to move, where the least-significant bit is the smallest disk, and the most-significant bit is the largest.

:Counting moves from 1 and identifying the disks by numbers starting from 0 in order of increasing size, the ordinal of the disk to be moved during move &quot;m&quot; is the number of times &quot;m&quot; can be divided by 2.

This technique identifies which disk to move, but not where to move it to. For the smallest disk, there are always two possibilities. For the other disks there is always one possibility, except when all disks are on the same peg, but in that case either it is the smallest disk that must be moved or the objective has already been achieved. Luckily, there is a rule that does say where to move the smallest disk to. Let &quot;f&quot; be the starting peg, &quot;t&quot; the destination peg, and &quot;r&quot; the remaining third peg. If the number of disks is odd, the smallest disk cycles along the pegs in the order &quot;f&quot; → &quot;t&quot; → &quot;r&quot; → &quot;f&quot; → &quot;t&quot; → &quot;r&quot;, etc. If the number of disks is even, this must be reversed: &quot;f&quot; → &quot;r&quot; → &quot;t&quot; → &quot;f&quot; → &quot;r&quot; → &quot;t&quot;, etc.

The position of the bit change in the Gray code solution gives the size of the disk moved at each step: 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, ... , a sequence also known as the ruler function, or one more than the power of 2 within the move number. In the Wolfram Language, codice_5 gives moves for the 8-disk puzzle.

== Graphical representation ==
The game can be represented by an undirected graph, the nodes representing distributions of disks and the edges representing moves. For one disk, the graph is a triangle:

The graph for two disks is three triangles connected to form the corners of a larger triangle.

A second letter is added to represent the larger disk. Clearly, it cannot initially be moved.

The topmost small triangle now represents the one-move possibilities with two disks:

The nodes at the vertices of the outermost triangle represent distributions with all disks on the same peg.

For h + 1 disks, take the graph of h disks and replace each small triangle with the graph for two disks.

For three disks the graph is:

* call the pegs a, b, and c
* list disk positions from left to right in order of increasing size

The sides of the outermost triangle represent the shortest ways of moving a tower from one peg to another one. The edge in the middle of the sides of the largest triangle represents a move of the largest disk. The edge in the middle of the sides of each next smaller triangle represents a move of each next smaller disk. The sides of the smallest triangles represent moves of the smallest disk.

In general, for a puzzle with &quot;n&quot; disks, there are 3&quot;n&quot; nodes in the graph; every node has three edges to other nodes, except the three corner nodes, which have two: it is always possible to move the smallest disk to one of the two other pegs, and it is possible to move one disk between those two pegs &quot;except&quot; in the situation where all disks are stacked on one peg. The corner nodes represent the three cases where all the disks are stacked on one peg. The diagram for &quot;n&quot; + 1 disks is obtained by taking three copies of the &quot;n&quot;-disk diagram—each one representing all the states and moves of the smaller disks for one particular position of the new largest disk—and joining them at the corners with three new edges, representing the only three opportunities to move the largest disk. The resulting figure thus has 3&quot;n&quot;+1 nodes and still has three corners remaining with only two edges.

As more disks are added, the graph representation of the game will resemble a fractal figure, the Sierpiński triangle. It is clear that the great majority of positions in the puzzle will never be reached when using the shortest possible solution; indeed, if the priests of the legend are using the longest possible solution (without re-visiting any position), it will take them 364 − 1 moves, or more than 1023 years.

The longest non-repetitive way for three disks can be visualized by erasing the unused edges:

Incidentally, this longest non-repetitive path can be obtained by forbidding all moves from &quot;a&quot; to &quot;c&quot;.

The Hamiltonian cycle for three disks is:

The graphs clearly show that:
* From every arbitrary distribution of disks, there is exactly one shortest way to move all disks onto one of the three pegs.
* Between every pair of arbitrary distributions of disks there are one or two different shortest paths.
* From every arbitrary distribution of disks, there are one or two different longest non-self-crossing paths to move all disks to one of the three pegs.
* Between every pair of arbitrary distributions of disks there are one or two different longest non-self-crossing paths.
* Let &quot;N&quot;&quot;h&quot; be the number of non-self-crossing paths for moving a tower of &quot;h&quot; disks from one peg to another one. Then:
** &quot;N&quot;1 = 2
** &quot;N&quot;&quot;h&quot;+1 = (&quot;N&quot;&quot;h&quot;)2 + (&quot;N&quot;&quot;h&quot;)3
This gives &quot;N&quot;&quot;h&quot; to be 2, 12, 1872, 6563711232, ... 

== Variations ==
=== Linear Hanoi ===
If all moves must be between adjacent pegs (i.e. given pegs A, B, C, one cannot move directly between pegs A and C), then moving a stack of &quot;n&quot; disks from peg A to peg C takes 3&quot;n&quot; − 1 moves. The solution uses all 3n valid positions, always taking the unique move that does not undo the previous move. The position with all disks at peg B is reached halfway, i.e. after (3&quot;n&quot; − 1) / 2 moves.

=== Cyclic Hanoi ===
In Cyclic Hanoi, we are given three pegs (A, B, C), which are arranged as a circle with the clockwise and the counterclockwise directions being defined as A – B – C – A and A – C – B – A, respectively. The moving direction of the disk must be clockwise. It suffices to represent the sequence of disks to be moved. The solution can be found using two mutually recursive procedures:

To move &quot;n&quot; disks counterclockwise to the neighbouring target peg:

# move &quot;n&quot; − 1 disks counterclockwise to the target peg
# move disk #&quot;n&quot; one step clockwise
# move &quot;n&quot; − 1 disks clockwise to the start peg
# move disk #&quot;n&quot; one step clockwise
# move &quot;n&quot; − 1 disks counterclockwise to the target peg

To move &quot;n&quot; disks clockwise to the neighbouring target peg:

# move &quot;n&quot; − 1 disks counterclockwise to a spare peg
# move disk #&quot;n&quot; one step clockwise
# move &quot;n&quot; − 1 disks counterclockwise to the target peg

Let C(n) and A(n) represent moving n disks clockwise and counterclockwise, then we can write down both formulas:

The solution for the Cyclic Hanoi has some interesting properties:

# The move-patterns of transferring a tower of disks from a peg to another peg are symmetric with respect to the center points.
# The smallest disk is the first and last disk to move.
# Groups of the smallest disk moves alternate with single moves of other disks.
# The number of disks moves specified by C(n) and A(n) are minimal.

=== With four pegs and beyond ===
Although the three-peg version has a simple recursive solution long been known, the optimal solution for the Tower of Hanoi problem with four pegs (called Reve&#x27;s puzzle) was not verified until 2014, by Bousch.

However, in case of four or more pegs, the Frame–Stewart algorithm is known without proof of optimality since 1941.

For the formal derivation of the exact number of minimal moves required to solve the problem by applying the Frame–Stewart algorithm (and other equivalent methods), see the following paper.

For other variants of the four-peg Tower of Hanoi problem, see Paul Stockmeyer&#x27;s survey paper.

The so-called Towers of Bucharest and Towers of Klagenfurt game configurations yield ternary and pentary Gray codes.

==== Frame–Stewart algorithm ====
The Frame–Stewart algorithm is described below:
* Let formula_4 be the number of disks.
* Let formula_5 be the number of pegs.
* Define formula_6 to be the minimum number of moves required to transfer n disks using r pegs.
The algorithm can be described recursively:
# For some formula_7, formula_8, transfer the top formula_7 disks to a single peg other than the start or destination pegs, taking formula_10 moves.
# Without disturbing the peg that now contains the top formula_7 disks, transfer the remaining formula_12 disks to the destination peg, using only the remaining formula_13 pegs, taking formula_14 moves.
# Finally, transfer the top formula_7 disks to the destination peg, taking formula_10 moves.
The entire process takes formula_17 moves. Therefore, the count formula_7 should be picked for which this quantity is minimum. In the 4-peg case, the optimal formula_7 equals formula_20, where formula_21 is the nearest integer function. For example, in the UPenn CIS 194 course on Haskell, the first assignment page lists the optimal solution for the 15-disk and 4-peg case as 129 steps, which is obtained for the above value of &quot;k&quot;.

This algorithm is presumed to be optimal for any number of pegs; its number of moves is 2Θ(&quot;n&quot;1/(&quot;r&quot;−2)) (for fixed &quot;r&quot;).

=== General shortest paths and the number 466/885 ===
A curious generalization of the original goal of the puzzle is to start from a given configuration of the disks where all disks are not necessarily on the same peg and to arrive in a minimal number of moves at another given configuration. In general, it can be quite difficult to compute a shortest sequence of moves to solve this problem. A solution was proposed by Andreas Hinz and is based on the observation that in a shortest sequence of moves, the largest disk that needs to be moved (obviously one may ignore all of the largest disks that will occupy the same peg in both the initial and final configurations) will move either exactly once or exactly twice.

The mathematics related to this generalized problem becomes even more interesting when one considers the &quot;average&quot; number of moves in a shortest sequence of moves between two initial and final disk configurations that are chosen at random. Hinz and Chan Tat-Hung independently discovered (see also
) that the average number of moves in an n-disk Tower is given by the following exact formula:

:formula_22

For large enough &quot;n&quot;, only the first and second terms do not converge to zero, so we get an asymptotic expression: formula_23, as formula_24. Thus intuitively, we could interpret the fraction of formula_25 as representing the ratio of the labor one has to perform when going from a randomly chosen configuration to another randomly chosen configuration, relative to the difficulty of having to cross the &quot;most difficult&quot; path of length formula_26 which involves moving all the disks from one peg to another. An alternative explanation for the appearance of the constant 466/885, as well as a new and somewhat improved algorithm for computing the shortest path, was given by Romik.

=== Magnetic Hanoi ===
In Magnetic Tower of Hanoi, each disk has two distinct sides North and South (typically colored &quot;red&quot; and &quot;blue&quot;).
Disks must not be placed with the similar poles together—magnets in each disk prevent this illegal move.
Also, each disk must be flipped as it is moved.
=== Bicolor Towers of Hanoi ===
This variation of the famous Tower of Hanoi puzzle was offered to grade 3–6 students at &quot;2ème Championnat de France des Jeux Mathématiques et Logiques&quot; held in July 1988.
The rules of the puzzle are essentially the same: disks are transferred between pegs one at a time. At no time may a bigger disk be placed on top of a smaller one. The difference is that now for every size there are two disks: one black and one white. Also, there are now two towers of disks of alternating colors. The goal of the puzzle is to make the towers monochrome (same color). The biggest disks at the bottom of the towers are assumed to swap positions.

===Tower of Hanoy===

A variation of the puzzle has been adapted as a solitaire game with nine playing cards under the name Tower of Hanoy. It is not known whether the altered spelling of the original name is deliberate or accidental.

== Applications ==

The Tower of Hanoi is frequently used in psychological research on problem-solving. There also exists a variant of this task called Tower of London for neuropsychological diagnosis and treatment of disorders of executive function.

Zhang and Norman used several isomorphic (equivalent) representations of the game to study the impact of representational effect in task design. They demonstrated an impact on user performance by changing the way that the rules of the game are represented, using variations in the physical design of the game components. This knowledge has impacted on the development of the TURF framework for the representation of human–computer interaction.

The Tower of Hanoi is also used as a backup rotation scheme when performing computer data backups where multiple tapes/media are involved.

As mentioned above, the Tower of Hanoi is popular for teaching recursive algorithms to beginning programming students. A pictorial version of this puzzle is programmed into the emacs editor, accessed by typing M-x hanoi. There is also a sample algorithm written in Prolog.

The Tower of Hanoi is also used as a test by neuropsychologists trying to evaluate frontal lobe deficits.

In 2010, researchers published the results of an experiment that found that the ant species &quot;Linepithema humile&quot; were successfully able to solve the 3-disk version of the Tower of Hanoi problem through non-linear dynamics and pheromone signals.

In 2014, scientists synthesized multilayered palladium nanosheets with a Tower of Hanoi-like structure.

== In popular culture ==
In the science fiction story &quot;Now Inhale&quot;, by Eric Frank Russell, a human is held prisoner on a planet where the local custom is to make the prisoner play a game until it is won or lost before his execution. The protagonist knows that a rescue ship might take a year or more to arrive, so he chooses to play Towers of Hanoi with 64 disks. This story makes reference to the legend about the Buddhist monks playing the game until the end of the world.

In the 1966 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story &quot;The Celestial Toymaker&quot;, the eponymous villain forces the Doctor to play a ten-piece, 1,023-move Tower of Hanoi game entitled The Trilogic Game with the pieces forming a pyramid shape when stacked.

In 2007, the concept of the Towers Of Hanoi problem was used in &quot;Professor Layton and the Diabolical Box&quot; in puzzles 6, 83, and 84, but the disks had been changed to pancakes. The puzzle was based around a dilemma where the chef of a restaurant had to move a pile of pancakes from one plate to the other with the basic principles of the original puzzle (i.e. three plates that the pancakes could be moved onto, not being able to put a larger pancake onto a smaller one, etc.)

In the 2011 film &quot;Rise of the Planet of the Apes&quot;, this puzzle, called in the film the &quot;Lucas Tower&quot;, is used as a test to study the intelligence of apes.

The puzzle is featured regularly in adventure and puzzle games. Since it is easy to implement, and easily recognised, it is well suited to use as a puzzle in a larger graphical game (e.g. &quot;Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic&quot; and &quot;Mass Effect&quot;). Some implementations use straight disks, but others disguise the puzzle in some other form. There is an arcade version by Sega.

A 15-disk version of the puzzle appears in the game &quot;Sunless Sea&quot; as a lock to a tomb. The player has the option to click through each move of the puzzle in order to solve it, but the game notes that it will take 32,767 moves to complete. If an especially dedicated player does click through to the end of the puzzle, it is revealed that completing the puzzle does not unlock the door.

This was first used as a challenge in &quot;Survivor&quot; Thailand in 2002 but rather than rings, the pieces were made to resemble a temple. Sook Jai threw the challenge to get rid of Jed even though Shii-Ann knew full well how to complete the puzzle.
The problem is featured as part of a reward challenge in a . Both players (Ozzy Lusth and Benjamin &quot;Coach&quot; Wade) struggled to understand how to solve the puzzle and are aided by their fellow tribe members.

In &quot;Genshin Impact&quot;, this puzzle is shown in Faruzan&#x27;s hangout quest, &quot;Early Learning Mechanism&quot;, where she mentions seeing it as a mechanism and uses it to make a toy prototype for children. She calls it pagoda stacks.

<text>Frederick Hubbard Gwynne (July 10, 1926 – July 2, 1993) was an American actor, artist and author, who is widely known for his roles in the 1960s television sitcoms &quot;Car 54, Where Are You?&quot; (as Francis Muldoon) and &quot;The Munsters&quot; (as Herman Munster), as well as his later film roles in &quot;The Cotton Club&quot; (1984), &quot;Pet Sematary&quot; (1989), and &quot;My Cousin Vinny&quot; (1992).

==Early life==

Gwynne was born on July 10, 1926, in New York City, the son of Frederick Walker Gwynne, a partner in the securities firm Gwynne Brothers, and his wife Dorothy Ficken Gwynne, who, before her marriage, was a successful artist known for her &quot;Sunny Jim&quot; comic character. He had at least two siblings, Dorothy Gwynne and Bowers Gwynne, both of whom died young. His paternal grandfather, Walker Gwynne, was an Anglican priest, born c. 1846 in Camus, County Tyrone, Ireland, who married American Helen Lea Bowers. His maternal grandfather, H. Edwards Ficken, was a British immigrant who married the American Josephine (or Josephina) Preston Hubbard. Although Gwynne partially grew up in Tuxedo Park, New York, he spent most of his childhood in South Carolina, Florida, and Colorado because his father traveled extensively.

Following his father&#x27;s death, his mother sent him to boarding school at Groton School, where he graduated in 1944 and may have set the school record for disciplinary black marks. He was president of the drama club and made his first stage appearance in a school production of &quot;Henry V&quot;. Forty years later, he used his drawing skills to pen the school&#x27;s official campus map.

Having attended high school during World War II, Gwynne joined the United States Navy after graduation, serving as a radioman on submarine chaser USS &quot;Manville&quot; (PC-581).

After the war, Gwynne attended art school at the Phoenix School of Design (now affiliated with the Pratt Institute) in New York, with &quot;the dream of doing &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; covers.&quot; He found that the work was not right for him, and transferred to Harvard College in 1948, graduating in 1951. He was a member of the Fly Club, served as president of the &quot;Harvard Lampoon&quot; (and as an in-house cartoonist), sang with the Harvard Krokodiloes a cappella group, and acted for the Hasty Pudding Theatricals. He was affiliated with Adams House. During his tenure as &quot;Lampoon&quot; president, the Middlesex County District Attorney once attempted to ban the publication of the &quot;Lampoon&quot;&#x27;s parody magazine for obscenity. In response, Gwynne joked that &quot;This just proves what we already knew – moral standards in New England are higher than elsewhere in the country.&quot;

In the 1940s, Gwynne was a summertime swimming instructor at the Duxbury Yacht Club pool in Duxbury, Massachusetts. 

==Career==
Gwynne joined the Brattle Theatre Repertory Company after his 1951 graduation, then moved to New York City. To support himself, Gwynne worked as a copywriter for the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency, resigning in 1952 upon being cast in his first Broadway role, a gangster in a comedy called &quot;Mrs. McThing&quot; starring Helen Hayes. Another early role was a New York City Drama Company production at City Center of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot; in 1953, in the role of Dull, a constable. Gwynne preferred theater to film and television, and maintained that if the United States had a national theater mounting year-round productions, he would rather work there.

In 1954, he made his first cinematic appearance playing – in an uncredited role – the laconic character Slim in the Oscar-winning film &quot;On the Waterfront&quot;. Shortly afterwards, Phil Silvers sought him for his television show because he had been impressed by Gwynne&#x27;s comedic work in &quot;Mrs. McThing&quot;. As a result, Gwynne made a memorable appearance on &quot;The Phil Silvers Show&quot; in the episode &quot;The Eating Contest&quot; as the character Corporal Ed Honnergar, whose depressive eating binges are exploited in an eating contest.

Gwynne&#x27;s second appearance on &quot;The Phil Silvers Show&quot; (in the episode &quot;It&#x27;s for the Birds&quot;) and appearances on many other shows led writer-producer Nat Hiken to cast him in the sitcom &quot;Car 54, Where Are You?&quot; as Patrolman Francis Muldoon.

Gwynne was 6 ft 5 in (1.96 m) tall, an attribute that contributed to his being cast as Herman Munster, a goofy parody of Frankenstein&#x27;s monster, in the sitcom &quot;The Munsters&quot;. For his role, he had to wear 40 or 50 lbs (18 or 23 kg) of padding, makeup, and 5-inch asphalt-spreader boots. His face was painted a bright violet because it captured the most light on the black-and-white film. Gwynne was known for his sense of humor and retained fond recollections of Herman, saying in later life, &quot;I might as well tell you the truth. I love old Herman Munster. Much as I try not to, I can&#x27;t stop liking that fellow.&quot;

After his iconic role in &quot;The Munsters&quot;, Gwynne found himself typecast, unable to gain new film roles for over two years. In 1969, he was cast as Jonathan Brewster in a television production of &quot;Arsenic and Old Lace.&quot; The Brewster character was originally played by Boris Karloff, who also played Frankenstein&#x27;s monster on which Gwynne&#x27;s Herman Munster character was based, in the Broadway production of the play. Gwynne then found success as a stage actor in regional state productions across the United States while maintaining a low Hollywood profile.

A talented vocalist, Gwynne sang in a &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot; television production &quot;The Littlest Angel&quot; (1969), and went on to perform in a variety of roles on stage and screen. In 1974, drawing upon his own Southern roots, he appeared in the role of Big Daddy Pollitt in the Broadway revival of &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot; with Elizabeth Ashley, Keir Dullea and Kate Reid. In 1975, he played the Stage Manager in &quot;Our Town&quot; at the American Shakespeare Theatre in Stratford, Connecticut.

From 1975 to 1982, Gwynne appeared in 83 episodes in different roles on the popular radio drama series, the &quot;CBS Radio Mystery Theater&quot;, produced and directed by Himan Brown. He returned to Broadway in 1976 as Colonel J.C. Kinkaid in two parts of &quot;A Texas Trilogy&quot;. In 1984, Gwynne auditioned for the part of Henry on the sitcom &quot;Punky Brewster&quot;, then withdrew in frustration when a director identified him as Herman Munster rather than by his real name. The role of Henry went to George Gaynes. In 1987, Gwynne starred in the short-lived TV series &quot;Jake&#x27;s M.O.&quot;, where he played an investigative reporter.

Gwynne&#x27;s performance as Jud Crandall in &quot;Pet Sematary&quot; was based on author Stephen King, who is only an inch shorter than the actor, and uses a similarly thick Maine dialect. The character&#x27;s likeness and accent, as played by Gwynne, have been used in a number of episodes of the animated show &quot;South Park&quot;, beginning in 2001 and as recently as 2019. Gwynne also had roles in the movies &quot;Simon&quot;, &quot;On the Waterfront&quot;, &quot;So Fine&quot;, &quot;Disorganized Crime&quot;, &quot;The Cotton Club&quot;, &quot;Captains Courageous&quot;, &quot;The Secret of My Success&quot;, &quot;Water&quot;, &quot;Ironweed&quot;, &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot;, and &quot;The Boy Who Could Fly&quot;. Despite his misgiving about having been typecast, he agreed to reprise the role of Herman Munster for the 1981 TV reunion movie &quot;The Munsters&#x27; Revenge&quot;. Gwynne performed the role of Judge Chamberlain Haller in his final film, the 1992 comedy &quot;My Cousin Vinny&quot;.

===As painter and illustrator===
In addition to his acting career, Gwynne sang professionally, painted, and wrote and illustrated children&#x27;s books, including &quot;Best in Show&quot; (later titled &quot;It&#x27;s Easy to See Why&quot;), &quot;Daddy Has a Mole on His Nose&quot;, &quot;A Chocolate Moose for Dinner&quot;, &quot;The King Who Rained&quot;, &quot;Pondlarker&quot;, &quot;The Battle of the Frogs and Mice&quot;, and &quot;A Little Pigeon Toad&quot;. Many of these efforts were based on children&#x27;s frequent misperceptions of things they hear from adults, such as the &quot;chocolate moose for dinner&quot;, illustrated as a moose seated at the dinner table. The other books on this theme were &quot;The King Who Rained&quot;, &quot;A Little Pigeon Toad&quot; (in which a child&#x27;s mother thus describes her father), and &quot;The Sixteen Hand Horse&quot;. Initially the books did not achieve wider popularity because their format was geared to a very young audience, but the concept was more appealing to older children and adults. Eventually they achieved critical success and became regular bestsellers for their publisher. He also did his voice work for TV and radio commercials. Later in his career he held several shows of his artwork, the first in 1989.

==Personal life==
In 1952, Gwynne married socialite Jean &quot;Foxy&quot; Reynard, a granddaughter of New York City mayor William Jay Gaynor. Before divorcing in 1980, the couple had five children: son Kieron (1953–1998); daughter Gaynor (b. 1954); son Evan (b. 1956); son Dylan (1962–1963, drowning); and daughter Madyn (b. 1965).

In 1988, Gwynne married his second wife, Deborah Flater. They remained married until his death in 1993.

==Death==
Gwynne died of complications from pancreatic cancer, in the cigar room at his home in Taneytown, Maryland, on July 2, 1993, aged 66. He is buried in an unmarked grave at Sandy Mount United Methodist Church Cemetery in Finksburg, Maryland.

<doc id="56995" wikidata="Q2000377" url="?curid=56995" title="North American Electric Reliability Corporation">
<text>The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) is a nonprofit corporation based in Atlanta, Georgia, and formed on March 28, 2006, as the successor to the North American Electric Reliability Council (also known as NERC). The original NERC was formed on June 1, 1968, by the electric utility industry to promote the reliability and adequacy of bulk power transmission in the electric utility systems of North America. NERC&#x27;s mission states that it &quot;is to assure the effective and efficient reduction of risks to the reliability and security of the grid&quot;.

NERC oversees six regional reliability entities and encompasses all of the interconnected power systems of Canada and the contiguous United States, as well as a portion of the Mexican state of Baja California.

NERC&#x27;s major responsibilities include working with all stakeholders to develop standards for power system operation, monitoring and enforcing compliance with those standards, assessing resource adequacy, and providing educational and training resources as part of an accreditation program to ensure power system operators remain qualified and proficient. NERC also investigates and analyzes the causes of significant power system disturbances in order to help prevent future events.

NERC&#x27;s standards for generating resources require that sufficient generating capacity be provided such that customers will need to be disconnected less often than once every ten years. These standards are mandatory for only some of the regional entities.

==Origins==
Originally formed as a voluntary organization in 1968 by the electricity industry and called the National Electric Reliability Council, the name was changed to include &quot;North American&quot; in place of &quot;National&quot; in 1981 in recognition of Canada&#x27;s participation and the broader scope of NERC&#x27;s footprint. The name was changed from &quot;Council&quot; to &quot;Corporation&quot; in 2007.

In 2000, NERC established the Electricity Sector Information Sharing and Analysis Center, which provides industry with timely responses and alerts on cyber and physical security threats that have the potential to impact the bulk power system. The ES-ISAC, which changed its name in 2015 to Electricity Information Sharing and Analysis Center, shares timely information with industry through its secure web portal.

In August 2003, North America experienced its worst blackout to date, as 50million people lost power in the Northeastern and Midwestern United States and Ontario, Canada. A United States–Canada Power System Outage Task Force was formed to investigate the causes of the blackout and to make recommendations to prevent future blackouts.

The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (US) called for the creation of an Electric Reliability Organization (ERO) to develop and enforce compliance with mandatory reliability standards in the United States. This non-governmental, &quot;self-regulatory organization&quot; was created in recognition of the interconnected and international nature of the bulk power grid.

In April 2006, NERC applied for and was granted the designation of the ERO by FERC in July 2006. NERC also filed the first set of mandatory Reliability Standards with FERC, as well as filing the same information with the Canadian provincial authorities in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Quebec, Saskatchewan, and with the National Energy Board of Canada.

==About NERC==
===Electricity Information Sharing and Analysis Center===
NERC also operates the Electricity Information Sharing and Analysis Center (E-ISAC). E-ISAC offers security services to bulk power system owners and operators across North America. E-ISAC services includes specific cyber and physical security threat intelligence, tailored cyber security knowledge and physical security collaboration. The E-ISAC, which NERC established at the request of the U.S. Department of Energy, works closely with NERC&#x27;s Bulk Power System Awareness team in Atlanta to monitor real-time cyber and physical security threats to the grid.

The E-ISAC, through capabilities including its Cybersecurity Risk Information Sharing Program (CRISP), works with critical asset owners and operators to analyze real-time cyber and physical security data for patterns of incidents with the potential to affect the bulk power system. NERC has a &quot;firewall&quot; separating the E-ISAC and NERC&#x27;s compliance and enforcement activities. The separation extends to a physical separation of the E-ISAC from the rest of NERC.

===Interconnections and regional entities===
====Interconnections====
* The Eastern Interconnection covers most of eastern North America, extending from the Great Plains to the Atlantic seaboard, excluding most of Texas. The Eastern Interconnection is tied to the Western Interconnection via high voltage DC transmission facilities and also has ties to non-NERC systems in northern Canada. 
* The Western Interconnection covers most of western North America, from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific coast. It is tied to the Eastern Interconnection at six points, and also has ties to non-NERC systems in northern Canada and Northwestern Mexico.
* The Texas Interconnection covers most of the state of Texas. It is tied to the Eastern Interconnection at two points, and also has ties to non-NERC systems in Mexico. 
* The Quebec Interconnection covers the province of Quebec and is tied to the Eastern Interconnection. About one third of Canada&#x27;s installed power (42 GW out of 130) and about one third of Canada&#x27;s production (184 TWh out of 567) are in this interconnection. Despite being a functionally separate interconnection, the Quebec Interconnection is often considered to be part of the Eastern Interconnection.

====Regional entities====

* Midwest Reliability Organization (MRO)
* Northeast Power Coordinating Council (NPCC)
* ReliabilityFirst (RF)
* SERC Reliability Corporation (SERC)
* Texas Reliability Entity (Texas RE)
* Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC)

===NERC authority===
As part of the fallout of the Northeast Blackout of 2003, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 authorized the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to designate a national Electric Reliability Organization (ERO). On July 20, 2006, FERC issued an order certifying NERC as the ERO for the United States.

In September 2018, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and NERC opened a joint investigation into a &quot;winter load event&quot; earlier in January that stressed the electrical grids in the Midwest. On January 17, Midwest and U.S. south central grid operators ordered emergency appeals for electricity conservation. This was due to high power demand caused by cold weather.

<doc id="56996" wikidata="Q332554" url="?curid=56996" title="Absolutely Fabulous">
<text>Absolutely Fabulous (often shortened to Ab Fab) is a British television sitcom created and written by Jennifer Saunders, which premiered in 1992. It is based on the 1990 &quot;French and Saunders&quot; sketch &quot;Modern Mother and Daughter&quot;, created by Dawn French and Saunders.

Saunders stars as Edina Monsoon, a heavy-drinking, drug-abusing PR mogul who spends her time failing to lose weight and chasing bizarre fads in a desperate attempt to stay young and &quot;hip&quot;. Edina&#x27;s best friend is ex-model and magazine fashion director Patsy Stone (Joanna Lumley), whose drug abuse, alcohol consumption and desperate promiscuity far eclipse Edina&#x27;s. Edina relies upon the support of her daughter Saffron (Julia Sawalha), a student and aspiring writer whose constant care of her immature mother has left her a bitter cynic. &quot;Ab Fab&quot; also stars June Whitfield in a supporting role as Edina&#x27;s dotty, sarcastic and often thieving mother, who appears in nearly every episode. Jane Horrocks as Edina&#x27;s utterly brainless personal assistant Bubble also features frequently.

The first three series of &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot; were broadcast on the BBC from 1992 to 1995, followed by a series finale in the form of a two-part special entitled &quot;The Last Shout,&quot; in 1996. In 2000, the show was ranked number 17 on the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes by the British Film Institute. It was revived for two more series and two one-hour specials from 2001 to 2004. Three new episodes, collectively titled &quot;Absolutely Fabulous: 20th Anniversary&quot;, were released in 2011–2012. Two sketches for charity specials were also released, for Comic Relief in 2005 and Sport Relief in 2012.

A film continuation, &quot;Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie&quot;, was theatrically released in 2016. Saunders then confirmed that she is &quot;not doing anything more with &quot;Ab Fab&quot;&quot;, as she wanted to focus on new projects. In October 2024, Saunders, Lumley, Sawalha and Horrocks appeared in the Documentary &quot;Absolutely Fabulous: Inside Out&quot;, which was broadcast on Gold.

==Premise==
Edina &quot;Eddie&quot; Monsoon (Saunders) and Patricia &quot;Patsy&quot; Stone (Lumley) are two high-powered career women on the London fashion scene. Eddie runs her own PR firm, and Patsy holds a sinecure position at a top British fashion magazine.

The two women use their considerable financial resources to indulge in cigarettes, alcohol (most notably Bollinger Champagne) and recreational drugs and to chase the latest fads in an attempt to maintain their youth and recapture their glory days as Mods in swinging London. The partnership is driven mainly by Patsy, who is both co-dependent and an enabler to Eddie.

Their lifestyle inevitably leads to various personal crises, which are invariably resolved by Eddie&#x27;s daughter, Saffron &quot;Saffy&quot; Monsoon (Sawalha), whose constant involvement in their exploits has left her increasingly bitter and cynical.

Eddie&#x27;s mother visits the home frequently to keep Saffy company and help her with the cooking and cleaning; Eddie and Mother, on the other hand, have a strained relationship, as they disagree on virtually everything and are rarely alone together.

Also recurring in their lives are Eddie&#x27;s ex-husbands, Marshall and Justin, and their respective new partners, the American hippie Bo and the acidic antique dealer Oliver.

==Production==

===Development===
&quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot; evolved from a &quot;French and Saunders&quot; sketch called &quot;Modern Mother and Daughter&quot; (from series 3 episode 6), which starred Saunders as the mother, named Adrianna, and French as the daughter, named Saffron (as in the series). The sketch revolved around a middle-aged single mother who acted like a teenager and was reliant upon the emotional and financial support of her teenage daughter, who behaved like a middle-aged woman.

It has no connection, other than the character&#x27;s name, to the earlier film, &quot;Eddie Monsoon: A Life?&quot;, a comedy play written by Saunders&#x27; husband Adrian Edmondson in 1984 for the TV series, &quot;The Comic Strip Presents...&quot;. The name &quot;Edina Monsoon&quot; is derived from Edmondson&#x27;s name and &quot;Eddy Monsoon&quot; is a nickname of his.

Saunders revealed in 2012 that she was inspired by pop band Bananarama, with whom she and Dawn French had become friends after their Comic Relief collaboration in 1989.

&quot;The nights with Bananarama were some of the best nights of my life, and I got a lot of gags from Bananarama because they were big vodka drinkers...when I started doing AbFab, I remembered all of the falls that I saw Bananarama do. I once saw one of them coming out of a cab bottom first and hitting the road, and I thought &#x27;that&#x27;s class&#x27;&quot;.

Although &quot;Ab Fab&quot; was produced by Saunders and French&#x27;s company, Saunders &amp; French Productions, Dawn French appeared on the show only once, in a cameo in the first-series episode &quot;Magazine&quot;, before making a brief cameo in the 2016 film. French was originally intended to play Edina&#x27;s daughter, Saffron, but a younger actress (Sawalha) was ultimately cast.

The first three series were broadcast on the BBC from 1992 to 1995, followed by a series finale in the form of a two-part television film entitled &quot;The Last Shout&quot; in 1996. Saunders revived the show for a fourth series in 2001 after writing and submitting a pilot entitled &quot;Mirrorball&quot;, which recruited nearly all of the original cast in new roles. The pilot was intended to be turned into a series of episodes. However, Saunders felt the AbFab characters were too rich and interesting to put aside and were far better suited for her new story ideas. Instead of &quot;Mirrorball&quot;, a new series of &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot; was proposed to the BBC, which later commissioned the fourth series in 2001. From 2001 to 2004, two series were produced, along with two one-off hour-long specials; &quot;Gay&quot; (retitled and issued as &quot;Absolutely Fabulous in New York&quot; for the United States) in 2002 and &quot;White Box&quot; (another series finale), which aired in 2004. A Comic Relief sketch was broadcast in 2005.

In November 2010, Lumley revealed to &quot;Playbill&quot; magazine that she had recently spoken to Saunders about possibly filming a new series. Lumley and Saunders reunited for the M&amp;S Christmas advert in 2009, along with other stars such as Twiggy and Stephen Fry.
In August 2011, Lumley confirmed the planned filming of three new episodes. In 2011, plans for a 20th-anniversary revival were welcomed in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, which applauded the show as &quot;prophetic&quot;. The first new special of &quot;Absolutely Fabulous: 20th Anniversary&quot; was broadcast on 25 December with the second episode being shown on 1 January 2012. The third and final special, aired on 23 July 2012, coincided with the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, with Stella McCartney appearing in a cameo role. A sketch for Sport Relief was also broadcast in 2012. A film version of the series, &quot;Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie,&quot; was released to theatres in the summer of 2016.

Three new specials were announced to celebrate the show&#x27;s 20th anniversary, with the first special, &quot;Identity&quot;, airing on 25 December 2011. Jon Plowman, executive producer and original producer of the series, said: &quot;Viewers have been fantastically loyal in their devotion to our show, so we&#x27;re really thrilled to say that it&#x27;s coming back for three new shows to celebrate our 20th anniversary. All of the originals who are back together again are still truly absolutely fabulous and the new adventures of Edina, Patsy, Saffy, Bubble and Mother, plus a few surprising guests, will be a real treat for viewers.&quot; Saunders announced in November 2011 that she had begun work on a film version of the series.

In the United States, the episodes were jointly co-produced by Logo and BBC America in the US. and aired in January 2012 for broadcast by both BBC America and Logo Channel. Both channels co-produced the 20th Anniversary episodes, although Logo removed some scenes for its airings. BBC America broadcast it in full. Both channels aired the episode in a 40-minute block to allow for commercial interruptions.

On 3 January 2012, following the success of the 20th anniversary specials, it was rumoured that Saunders was set to write another Christmas special for 2012. The BBC was rumoured to be urging her to write a sixth series for 2013. Saunders denied the reports of additional episodes via her Twitter account.

Episodes of &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot; were shot in front of a live studio audience.

===Theme song===
The theme song for &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot; is &quot;This Wheel&#x27;s on Fire&quot;, written by Bob Dylan and Rick Danko and performed by Julie Driscoll and Saunders&#x27; Comic Strip fellow and later husband, Adrian Edmondson. The song was also sung by Marianne Faithfull and P. P. Arnold for the two-part special, &quot;The Last Shout&quot;, in 1996. Hermine Demoriane sang the theme song with a French accent over the closing credits of the series 4 episode &quot;Paris&quot; in 2001. At the end of the series 1 episode &quot;Birthday&quot;, Edina and Patsy sang the song together on a karaoke machine. It was later performed by Debbie Harry and Edmondson in the 2002 Christmas special &quot;Gay&quot; (where Harry also guest-starred), as well as in series 5. For series 4, a line sung by David Bowie, &quot;Ziggy played guitar&quot;, from his song &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot;, played at the end of each episode.

Due to copyright issues, the theme song is missing from many US Region 1 DVDs, replaced by an instrumental version. Also excised from the US DVD release is the musical number from &quot;Chicago&quot; performed by Horrocks, Gaffney, and Ryan during a dream sequence in the series 5 episode &quot;Birthin&#x27;&quot;.

In addition to the official theme song, in 1994, Pet Shop Boys recorded a song for &quot;Comic Relief&quot; using excerpts of dialogue from the series put to dance music. The single was attributed to &quot;Absolutely Fabulous produced by Pet Shop Boys&quot;. It peaked at number six on the UK Singles Chart in July 1994. The music video featured clips from the show and specially recorded footage of the Pet Shop Boys with Patsy and Edina.

On 10 June 2016, Kylie Minogue released a cover version of &quot;This Wheel&#x27;s on Fire&quot; for the soundtrack to &quot;Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie&quot;, before the film&#x27;s release in July 2016.

===Conclusion===
On 29 November 2016, Jennifer Saunders confirmed that she was &quot;done&quot; with &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot; and that it would not return to television for another series or specials, nor would a sequel to the film be made. Saunders said she wished to focus on new projects and spend more time with her family. Even so, in 2018, Saunders, when asked about the prospect of reviving the programme yet again, did not entirely dismiss it, saying &quot;I am thinking at the moment of writing a little something. It has to be age-appropriate otherwise we’d have to be in wheelchairs basically. I think Julia is old enough to be my mother now.&quot; Saunders said the prospect of writing new stories with those characters was &quot;always on [her] mind, always&quot;.

In November 2020, Joanna Lumley was asked about the possibility of another revival and said that that would be up to Saunders. Lumley said it was unlikely, as Saunders did not want to work on new stories featuring the characters at that time. Lumley said that June Whitfield&#x27;s death in December 2018 also meant it was less likely to happen, but said if Saunders wished to write new &quot;Ab Fab&quot; stories, she would be up for returning to play Patsy; she said &quot;wait and see&quot;.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===

Tim Gray of &quot;Variety&quot; magazine said that &quot;&quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot;, British sitcom about a rich, self-absorbed, falling-down-drunk woman, is not as funny as it intends to be, but it is absolutely unique, absolutely rude and absolutely politically incorrect&quot;. He also said that &quot;&quot;AbFab&quot; offers no sense of justice, which may give viewers the heebie-jeebies, since Americans like to believe that the wicked, even if they are amusing, will get punished. But the characters are originals, and &quot;AbFab&quot; has the courage of its convictions, encouraging audiences to find humor in such recent comedic taboos as substance abuse or mistreated offspring.&quot;

Michael Hogan of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; gave the 20th Anniversary specials a negative review; following the &quot;Olympics&quot; episode, he commented, &quot;The special Olympic edition of &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot; [...] would have won no medals for comedy.&quot; He added, &quot;This was the last of three 20th anniversary specials, the first pair of which were shown over Christmas. Every single one of those 20 years showed on-screen during this torturous half-hour.&quot;

In a more favourable review, Meredith Blake of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; stated, &quot;While longtime &quot;AbFab&quot; fans will enjoy this latest incarnation of the series, which has been reprised multiple times since its official end in 1995, &#x27;Identity&#x27; most definitely isn&#x27;t for &quot;AbFab&quot; neophytes, who will most likely be confused by the broad performances, the outré costumes, and the disembodied canned laughter.&quot;

===Ratings===
===Accolades===
===Cultural impact===
In 2000, &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot; was ranked as the 17th greatest British television show of all time by the British Film Institute (BFI). In 1997, the pilot episode, &quot;Fashion&quot;, was ranked #47 on &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s &quot;100 Greatest Episodes of All-Time&quot; list. A scene from the show was included in the &quot;TV&#x27;s 100 Greatest Moments&quot; programme broadcast by Channel 4 in 1999. In 2004 and 2007, the show was ranked #24 and #29 on &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s &quot;Top Cult Shows Ever&quot; list. In 2019, the series ranked #9 in &quot;Radio Times&quot;&#x27; top 20 British sitcoms of all time. &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot; has a 96% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.

From its earliest series, &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot; won a devoted cult status with gay audiences, which persists. There have been numerous tributes over the years, such as an &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot; drag show at Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras, and the song &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot; by synth-pop duo Pet Shop Boys. Later series of the show leaned into its cult status, including more gay-related storylines, such as Edina&#x27;s search for her estranged gay son and Edina and Patsy marrying each other in a same-sex commitment ceremony.

==Adaptations and related media==
A proposed American remake that would have starred Carrie Fisher and Barbara Carrera was put into motion by Roseanne Barr but never materialised. However, Barr did incorporate many elements of the show into the ninth season of her eponymous show &quot;Roseanne&quot;, in which her character wins the lottery: Saunders and Lumley reprised their characters Edina and Patsy, and Mo Gaffney also appeared in the episode, though not as her character Bo. Two later American sitcoms, &quot;Cybill&quot; and &quot;High Society&quot;, also adapted elements of &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot; for the American audience.

It was announced on 7 October 2008 that an American version of the series was in the works. The series was tentatively called &quot;Ab Fab&quot; and relocated to Los Angeles. &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; writer Christine Zander worked on the new scripts and would have been executive producer along with Saunders and BBC Worldwide&#x27;s Ian Moffitt. Sony Pictures Television, BBC Worldwide, and indie Tantamount were producing the new series for Fox, which greenlighted the pilot as a possible Fall 2009 entry with Kathryn Hahn as Eddy and Kristen Johnston as Patsy. In May 2009, Fox decided not to commission a full series.

The stage for the kitchen in &quot;Ab Fab&quot; was subsequently used as the stage for the shop in the British comedy &quot;Miranda&quot;. Miranda Hart, creator of the show, had previously appeared on &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot;.

===&quot;Mirrorball&quot;===
&quot;Mirrorball&quot; was a pilot set in the London theatre scene, starring the cast of &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot; as alternative characters. While writing and filming the show, Saunders was inspired to revive &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot; for a fourth series, which resulted in her abandoning &quot;Mirrorball&quot;. It was eventually aired as a television special and is included as a special feature on the fourth series DVD. Some original characters from Mirrorball feature in the fourth series.

===&quot;Absolument fabuleux&quot;===
A French film inspired by &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot;, titled &quot;Absolument fabuleux&quot;, was released in 2001. It was written and directed by Gabriel Aghion, and starred Josiane Balasko as Eddy and Nathalie Baye as Patsy. Saunders had a small cameo alongside Catherine Deneuve as a spectator at a fashion show. Amanda Lear was asked to play the part of Patsy but turned it down laughingly, saying she had &quot;already lived it&quot;.

===&quot;Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie&quot;===
In 2011, before the release of the new episodes for 2011/2012, &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; reported that Saunders planned to begin writing a script for a film of &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot; in 2012. The film would begin with Edina and Patsy waking up on an oligarch&#x27;s deserted yacht, drifting in the ocean. Saunders later said that the film would be set on the French Riviera. In March 2012, Saunders confirmed that she was working on the script. She said of the film&#x27;s plotline:
Saunders also stated that now that she had announced plans for a feature, there was no going back. She would do it for no reason other than having her alter-ego and Patsy walk down the red carpet at the film&#x27;s premiere. In April 2013, Saunders said on the &quot;Alan Carr Chatty Man&quot; show that she had doubts about the film as she felt the cast was &quot;too old&quot;. She felt pressure to write it and did not want to commit herself to it at this early stage.

On 4 January 2014 whilst appearing on &quot;The Jonathan Ross Show&quot;, Saunders officially confirmed that the movie will definitely be happening, as she felt obliged to write a script for a film adaptation after threatening it for so long. Saunders was quoted as saying: &quot;Joanna Lumley kept announcing it and saying, &#x27;Yes she&#x27;s going to do it,&#x27; and then Dawn French on our radio show at Christmas said, &#x27;I bet £100,000 that you don&#x27;t write it,&#x27; so now I have to write it, otherwise I have to pay her £100,000&#x27;&quot;. In April 2014, Saunders again confirmed on BBC Breakfast that she was in the process of writing the film, and gave a prospective release date of sometime during 2015.

Principal photography on the film began on 12 October 2015 in the south of France and it premiered in London on 29 June 2016.

==Home media==
&quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot; was initially released on VHS in the UK by BBC Video ending with the eight-VHS box set &quot;Series 1–4&quot; in November 2002. In the United States, series 1 and 2 were released together on Laserdisc by CBS/FOX in a boxed set in 1995, followed by series 3, released by CBS/FOX the following year and &quot;The Last Shout&quot; released by Image Entertainment in 1997. All episodes were later released on DVD, including a five-DVD box set titled &quot;The Complete DVD Collection: Series 1–4&quot; in 2002. BBC Video distributed all releases and 2 Entertain (post 2004) except for &quot;The Last Shout&quot; which was released by Vision Video and Universal Studios. The entire series is also available on demand on iTunes. When the first three series were re-released on DVD, they did not include corresponding cover photography to their series: Series 1 included an image from the Series 3 episode &quot;Jealous&quot;, Series 2 had an image from the Series 3 episode &quot;Doorhandle&quot; and Series 3 is from the Series 2 episode &quot;Poor&quot;. All other releases included imagery from the correct series, as do the original VHS releases.

In North America, all episodes have been released on DVD by BBC Video and Warner Home Video, including a complete collection named &quot;Absolutely Everything&quot;. &quot;The Last Shout&quot; and &quot;Gay&quot; (released in the UK individually) were released as a collection called &quot;Absolutely Special&quot; in 2003. Another feature-length special &quot;White Box&quot; was released exclusively to the American market. It was eventually released in the United Kingdom on 15 November 2010 with its inclusion in the &quot;Absolutely Everything&quot; box set.

Other releases include &quot;Absolutely Not&quot;, a bloopers and outtakes collection, and &quot;Absolutely Fabulous: A Life&quot; (released as &quot;Ab Fab: Moments&quot; in the United States exclusively to VHS), a mockumentary including 15 minutes of new material interspersed with clips from the series. Both were only released on VHS in the UK; the latter was also released as a special feature on the box set release &quot;Absolutely Everything&quot; in America.

Save for &quot;The Last Shout&quot; and the specials &quot;Gay&quot; (aka &quot;Absolutely Fabulous in New York&quot;) and &quot;White Box&quot;, the entire series is available to stream via Hulu. The series is also available on Netflix.

=== UK VHS ===
In the United Kingdom, VHS releases were distributed by BBC Video, except &quot;The Last Shout,&quot; which was released by Vision Video, with a final release in 2002.

===DVD releases===
All five series of &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot; have been released on DVD in individual series sets in Region 1, 2 &amp; 4 via BBC Video, 2Entertain and Roadshow Entertainment, respectively. The specials have also been made available, not all in individual sets; &quot;The Last Shout&quot; was handled through Via Vision on Region 2, Universal Studios Home Entertainment on Region 4, and it was included alongside &quot;Gay&quot; on Region 1 from BBC Video. &quot;Gay” was only released individually on Region 2, while it was included with the fifth series Region 4 DVD. &quot;White Box&quot; was only made available individually on Region 1 &amp; 4. The 20th Anniversary DVD was released individually on all regions.

A set comprising the first three series was released on Region 1 only. A series one to four set was made available on Region 2 &amp; 4. In 2006, Region 4 was the first region to release all five series; however, due to licensing rights, &quot;The Last Shout&quot; was omitted from the set, but &quot;Gay&quot; and &quot;White Box&quot; remained. It was re-released in 2011, including &quot;The Last Shout&quot;. The same set was released prior on Region 1 in 2008 and on Region 2 in 2010, which, for the first time, included &quot;White Box&quot; in the UK, which was never available individually. A complete series set was released on all regions with the addition of the 20th Anniversary Specials.

<doc id="57001" wikidata="Q1194769" url="?curid=57001" title="Economy of São Tomé and Príncipe">
<text>The economy of São Tomé and Príncipe, while traditionally dependent on cocoa, is experiencing considerable changes due to investment in the development of its oil industry in the oil-rich waters of the Gulf of Guinea.

==History==
Under Portuguese colonial rule, sugar plantations were set up, and the islands were used for the transshipment of slaves.

==Oil reserves ==

Geologists estimate that the Gulf of Guinea zone (Niger Delta province) holds more than 10 billion barrels (1.6 km3) of oil, although no reserves have yet been proven. A joint oil project with Nigeria in 2005 is likely to contribute $50 million of revenues to the government from the exploration licence signing fees. This represents four times government revenues in 2004. São Tomé is optimistic that significant petroleum discoveries under the exploration licence are forthcoming, though no crude oil nor natural gas has been found as of 2021.

==Agriculture ==

Since the 1800s, the economy of São Tomé and Príncipe has been based on plantation agriculture. At the time of independence, Portuguese-owned plantations occupied 90% of the cultivated area. After independence, control of these plantations passed to various state-owned agricultural enterprises. The dominant crop on São Tomé is cocoa, representing about 95% of exports. Other export crops include copra, palm kernels, and coffee.
== Economic issues==

The government has an economic program that is supported by the IMF, via its Extended Credit Facility arrangement.

<doc id="57002" wikidata="Q3315868" url="?curid=57002" title="Economy of the Marshall Islands">
<text>The government of the Marshall Islands is the largest employer, employing 30.6% of the work force, down by 3.4% since 1988. GDP is derived mainly from payments made by the United States under the terms of the amended Compact of Free Association. Direct U.S. aid accounted for 60% of the Marshall Islands&#x27; $90 million budget. 

The main economic activities in the Marshall Islands are copra production and fisheries. Under the terms of the Compact of Free Association, Marshallese citizens can travel and work in the United States without visas, which has contributed to more than a 22% population decline over the period 2000–2021.

The Marshall Islands has no central bank. The official currency of the Marshall Islands is the US Dollar.

== Subsistence economy ==

The subsistence economy consists of fishing and breadfruit, banana, taro, and pandanus cultivation. On the outer islands, production of copra and handicrafts provide cash income. The modern service-oriented economy is located in Majuro and Ebeye. It is sustained by government expenditures and the U.S. Army installation at Kwajalein Atoll. The airfield there also serves as a second national hub for international flights.

== Modern economy ==

The modern sector consists of wholesale and retail trade; restaurants; banking and insurance; offshore companies registration; construction, repair, and professional services; and copra processing. Company formation in the Marshall Islands is available for residents and non-residents. Non-residents enjoy privacy benefits and zero local taxes. Copra cake and oil are by far the nation&#x27;s largest exports. A tuna processing plant employs 300 workers, mostly women, at $1.50 per hour. Copra production, the most important single commercial activity for the past 100 years, now depends on government subsidies. The subsidies, more a social policy than an economic strategy, help reduce migration from outer atolls to densely populated Majuro and Ebeye.

Marine resources, including fishing, aquaculture, tourism development, and agriculture, are top government development priorities. The Marshall Islands sells fishing rights to other nations as a source of income. In recent years, the Marshall Islands has begun to offer ship registrations under the Marshall Islands flag. As a small nation, the Marshall Islands must import a wide variety of goods, including foodstuffs, consumer goods, machinery, and petroleum products.

Marshall Islands has signed a bilateral trade agreement with Taiwan in 2019, this agreement has been approved in 2023 and will take effect at a future date.

==Coconut oil==
Power authorities, private companies, and entrepreneurs are experimenting with coconut oil as an alternative to diesel fuel for vehicles, power generators, and ships. Coconut trees abound in the Pacific&#x27;s tropical islands. One liter of oil can be produced from the copra of 6–10 coconuts.

==Digital currency==
In February 2018, the Marshallese government enacted the Sovereign Currency Act of 2018 to develop a national digital currency, the Marshallese Sovereign (SOV), that would reduce the country&#x27;s dependence on the U.S. dollar. The SOV plan prompted a vote of no confidence in President Hilda Heine, who was in favour of the scheme, in November 2018, which failed when parliament deadlocked on the question.

The SOV is intended to serve as a second legal tender for the Marshall Islands, alongside the U.S. dollar; however, the International Monetary Fund has stated that it does not meet the definition of a central bank digital currency. The IMF also raised concerns about macroeconomic and financial integrity risks associated with the digital currency. Despite the objections of the IMF, the U.S. Treasury Department, and banks, the Marshallese government has continued to work toward the development of the SOV. The country is using Algorand open-source blockchain technology for the SOV ledger.

The islands have few natural resources, and their imports far exceed exports. According to the CIA, the value of exports in 2013 was approximately $53.7 million while estimated imports were $133.7 million. Agricultural products include coconuts, tomatoes, melons, taro, breadfruit, fruits, pigs and chickens. Industry is made up of the production of copra and craft items, tuna processing and tourism. The CIA estimates that the GDP in 2016 was an estimated $180 million, with a real growth rate of 1.7% while the GDP per capita was $3,300.

<text>Austronesian settlers arrived in the Marshall Islands in the 2nd millennium BC, but there are no historical or oral records of that period. Over time, the Marshallese people learned to navigate over long ocean distances by &quot;walap&quot; canoe using traditional stick charts.

==Prehistory==
Linguistic and anthropological studies have suggested that the first Austronesian settlers of the Marshall Islands arrived from the Solomon Islands. Radiocarbon dating of &quot;um&quot; earth ovens, post holes, and trash pits at Bikini Atoll suggests that the atoll may have been continuously inhabited from 1200 BCE to at least 1300 CE, though samples may not have been collected from secure stratigraphic contexts and older driftwood samples may have affected results. Archaeological digs on other atolls have found evidence of human habitation dating around the 1st century CE, including earth ovens at the Laura village, Majuro, with a date range of 93 BCE to 127 CE and Kwajalein with a range of 140 BCE to 255 CE.

The Marshallese sailed between islands on proas made from breadfruit-tree wood and coconut-fiber rope. They navigated by using the stars for orientation and initial course setting, but also developed a unique piloting technique of reading disruptions in ocean swells to determine the location of low coral atolls below the horizon. The Marshallese recognized four different types of swells coming from the cardinal directions, and noticed that swells refracted around the undersea slope of atolls. When refracted swells from different directions met, they created noticeable disruption patterns, which Marshallese pilots could read to determine the direction of an island. When interviewed by anthropologists, some Marshallese sailors noted that they piloted their canoes by both sight and feeling changes in the motion of the boat. The Marshallese preferred to sail between July and October, because Pacific trade winds made the swells harder to read during the rest of the year. Sailors also invented stick charts to map the swell patterns, but unlike western navigational charts, the Marshallese stick charts were tools for teaching students and for consultation before embarking on a voyage; navigators did not take charts with them when they set sail. The Marshallese made three types of charts: mattang charts, which were instructional tools for teaching the principles of piloting, and meddo and rebbelib charts, which represented the relative positions of actual swells and islands.

The Austronesian settlers introduced Southeast Asian crops, including coconuts, giant swamp taro, and breadfruit, as well as domesticated chickens throughout the Marshall Islands. They possibly seeded the islands by leaving coconuts at seasonal fishing camps before permanently settling years later. The southern islands receive heavier rainfall than the north, so communities in the wet south subsisted on prevalent taro and breadfruit, while northerners were more likely to subsist on pandanus and coconuts. Southern atolls probably supported larger, more dense populations. Archaeological digs have found adzes and chisels made from tridacna and cassis shells as well as ornaments, jewelry, beads, fishhooks, and fishing lures made from shell and coral.

When Russian explorer Otto von Kotzebue visited the Marshalls in 1817, the islanders still showed few signs of western influence, aside from a few scraps of metal and stories of passing ships. He observed that the Marshallese lived in thatched-roof huts, but their villages did not include the large-ornate meetinghouses found in other parts of Micronesia. They did not have furniture, except for woven mats, which they used for both floor coverings and clothing. The Marshallese had pierced ears and tattoos. Kotzebue noted that the Marshallese tried to keep women away from foreigners, similar to other Micronesians and unlike Polynesians. On the islands he visited, Kotzebue learned that Marshallese families practiced infanticide after the birth of a third child as a form of population planning due to frequent famines. He also noted that Marshallese iroij (chieftains) held considerable authority and rights to all property, though he had a more favorable view of the condition of Marshallese commoners than of Polynesian commoners. The Marshalls&#x27; two island groups, the Ratak and Ralik chains were each ruled by a paramount chief, or iroijlaplap, who held authority over the individual island iroij.

==European exploration==
===Spanish exploration===
Spanish explorer Alonso de Salazar led the first European expedition to see the Marshall Islands on August 21, 1526. While commanding the &quot;Santa Maria de la Victoria&quot;, the only surviving vessel of the Loaísa Expedition, his crew sighted an atoll with a green lagoon, which may have been Taongi. The crew could not land on the island, because of strong currents and water too deep for the ship&#x27;s anchor. Salazar named the island &quot;San Bartolomé,&quot; and the ship sailed for Guam on August 23.

In late December 1527, the Spanish ship &quot;Florida&quot; arrived in Marshall Islands as the expedition of Álvaro de Saavedra Cerón crossed the Pacific from Mexico to the Maluku Islands. The expedition probably saw the Utirik, Toke, Rongelap, and Ailinginae atolls, though Francis Hezel suggests the islands could have also been Fais and Yap in the Caroline Islands. Saavedra named the island grouping &quot;&quot;Islas de los Reyes&quot; () due to the proximity of the Christian feast of the Epiphany. Canoes from the islands approached the ship but did not make contact with the Europeans. On January 2, 1528, the expedition landed on an uninhabited island in Ailinginae Atoll, where they resupplied and stayed for six days. Natives from a neighboring island briefly met the Spanish before fleeing. Saavedra&#x27;s expedition sailed toward the Philippines on January 8. Saavedra made two unsuccessful attempts to recross the Pacific and return to Mexico. On September 21, 1529, on the second recrossing attempt, the expedition may have passed Ujelang Atoll, and on October 1, the ship anchored at Enewetak Atoll where the crew went ashore for eight days, exchanged gifts with the indigenous inhabitants and resupplied. Saavedra named the atoll &quot;Los Jardines&quot;&quot; ().

On December 26, 1542, a fleet of six Spanish ships commanded by Ruy López de Villalobos sighted an island in the Marshalls while sailing from Mexico to the Philippines. They landed and named the island &quot;Santisteban&quot; in honor of Saint Stephen&#x27;s Day. The island was inhabited, though many of the people fled the Spanish landing. The Spaniards found some women and children hiding in the island&#x27;s vegetation and gave them gifts. Before leaving the islands on January 6, 1543, Villalobos sighted islands that may have included Wotje, Erikub, Maloelap, Likiep, Kwajalein, Lae, Ujae, Wotho or Ujelang.

Miguel López de Legazpi commanded a fleet of four Spanish ships that sailed from Mexico in November 1564 en route to the Philippines. The &quot;San Lucas&quot; under the command of Alonso de Arellano broke away from the others, possibly because pilot Lope Martín and other crew members intended to engage in piracy in the East Indies, and sailed into the Marshall Islands in their attempt to avoid the fleet&#x27;s other ships. The ship passed Likiep on January 5, 1565; Kwajalein on January 7, where they met two Native families; and Lib Island on January 8. Lib was heavily inhabited, and Arellano described the Natives as warlike and expert at throwing stones with slings, so the ship sailed on without landing. Meanwhile, Legazpi&#x27;s other three ships arrived at Mejit on January 9, 1565. On the island, they found a settlement of one-hundred people who subsisted by fishing, farming root vegetables and millet-like grains, and raising poultry. Most of the inhabitants had fled into the interior, but the Spaniards had peaceful relations with an elderly couple and a woman who stayed behind. Legazpi named the island &quot;&quot;Los Barbudos&quot; (), because of the inhabitants&#x27; facial hair. On January 10, the Spaniards sighted Ailuk Atoll and Jemo Island, which they named &quot;Los Placeres&quot; () and &quot;Los Pajaros&quot;&quot; (). On January 12, they sighted Wotho Atoll, and on January 15, Ujelang, before sailing to the Philippines.

The &quot;San Lucas&quot; returned to Mexico on July 17, 1565, and one of Legazpi&#x27;s other ships returned from the Philippines on September 18. On May 1, 1566, the &quot;San Jeronimo&quot; sailed from Acapulco to resupply Legazpi in the Philippines. Lope Martín, who had returned to Mexico on the &quot;San Lucas&quot;, served as pilot of the &quot;San Jeronimo&quot; and led a mutiny and executed the captain. While sailing through the Marshalls, the &quot;San Jeronimo&quot; nearly wrecked at Ujelang before anchoring in the atoll&#x27;s lagoon on July 6. The mutineers spent several days resupplying on an island, which was inhabited though the residents had fled in canoes. On July 16, four loyalist crew members snuck back to the ship and took control from the mutineers aboard. Lope Martín had taken the ships instruments and sails ashore. Unable to take back the ship, he negotiated to return of the ship&#x27;s instruments in exchange for food and supplies. After regaining the sails, the loyalist crew members marooned Lope Martín and twenty-six other mutineers on the island before sailing for Guam on July 21.

By the late 16th century, Spanish galleons sailing between the Americas and the Philippines kept to a sea lane thirteen degrees north and provisioned at Guam, avoiding the Marshalls, which Spanish sailors saw as unprofitable islands amid hazardous waters. One of the last known Spanish expeditions occurred when Álvaro de Mendaña de Neira&#x27;s ships &quot;Los Reyes&quot; and &quot;Todos los Santos&quot; arrived at Namu Atoll on September 18, 1568, while searching for &quot;Terra Australis&quot;. Mendaña named the atoll &quot;San Mateo&quot; shoals. They found many houses as well as a chisel made from a nail and pieces of rope, which may have been left behind by Villalobos or Lope Martín. On October 20, the ships arrived at Wake Island, which Mendaña named &quot;San Francisco.&quot;

===Later European exploration===
The British ships &quot;Charlotte&quot; and &quot;Scarborough&quot; visited the islands in 1788 under the commands of captains Thomas Gilbert and John Marshall, respectively. The vessels had been part of the First Fleet taking convicts from England to Botany Bay in New South Wales, and were en route to Guangzhou when they passed through the Gilbert Islands and Marshall Islands. On June 25, 1788, the British ships traded with islanders at Mili Atoll; their meeting may have been the first contact between Europeans and Marshallese in over 200 years. Gilbert and Marshall also sighted Arno, Majuro, Aur, Maloelap, Wotje, and Ailuk atolls in late June, but made no further landings. Subsequent navigational charts and maps named the islands for John Marshall.

Beginning in the 1790s, British East Indiamen began passing through the Marshall Islands en route to China and charted the islands they encountered. Most of the islands and atolls had been sighted and plotted on navigation charts by 1815, with the exception of a few northern islands.

Russian explorer Otto von Kotzebue spent three months exploring the Ratak Chain in early 1817, and returned to explore the islands on two occasions in 1824 and 1825. According to Kotzebue&#x27;s account, the Marshallese people showed few signs of western influence on his first visit in 1817. He gifted the islanders metal knives and hatchets and set up a temporary forge to craft fishhooks and harpoons. He also introduced new crops, including yams, as well as livestock, including pigs, goats, dogs, and cats. Kotzebue also noted that in 1817, Lamari, the iroij of Aur Atoll, had successfully conquered the other atolls of northern Ratak Chain and was preparing to go to war with Majuro Atoll. On his return trips in the 1820s, Kotzebue found that the Marshallese were still tending to crops that he had given them, but that the livestock and metal tools were concentrated among the island chieftains. He also found that the metal hatchets had played a decisive role in Lamari&#x27;s victory over the people of Majuro; by the time of Kotzebue&#x27;s second visit, Lamari was planning to further expand his power and begin making incursions into the Ralik Chain.

==Early colonialism==
In February 1824, the American whaler &quot;Globe&quot; anchored at Mili Atoll after the crew mutinied and killed the ship&#x27;s officers. While the mutineers were ashore, five dissenting crew members made off with the ship and marooned the mutineers. Two years later, the American navy schooner &quot;Dolphin&quot; arrived and found that mutineers had been massacred by the Marshallese due to their brutal treatment of the local women. The only survivors were two boys, who had been spared and adopted by the Marshallese.

From the 1830s through the 1850s, the Marshallese Islanders became increasingly hostile to western vessels, possibly because of violent punishments that sea captains exacted for theft as well as the abduction of Marshallese people for sale into slavery on Pacific plantations. In 1833, the inhabitants of Ebon Atoll seized a dozen crew members of the British whaler &quot;Elizabeth&quot; when they went ashore. The sailors were never seen again. In 1834, the captain of a trading schooner and two of his crew members were killed at Bikini Atoll. Three vessels were sent to search for the captain, and when the Hawaiian brig &quot;Waverly&quot; discovered evidence of his death, the crew killed 30 Marshallese hostages in retaliation. In 1835, the inhabitants of Namdrik Atoll boarded the Massachusetts whaler &quot;Awashonks&quot;, killing the captain and five crew members before their iroij was killed by a musket shot. The inhabitants of Mili Atoll attacked whalers in 1837 and 1844. In 1845, a fight broke out on the deck of the &quot;Naiad&quot; after the captain violently punished a native for stealing from the ship. Several Marshallese were killed and four crew members were seriously wounded. In 1850, two passengers of the &quot;William Melville&quot; were killed after going ashore at Kwajalein Atoll. In 1851 and 1852, the Marshallese attacked three ships and massacred their crews: the &quot;Glencoe&quot; at Ebon, the &quot;Sea Nymph&quot; at Jaluit Atoll, and an unnamed ship at Namdrik. There were no survivors from the &quot;Glencoe&quot;, and only one &quot;Sea Nymph&quot; crew member escaped. By some accounts, both ships were abducting Marshallese women to sell to plantation owners in other parts of the Pacific.

European and American missionaries and traders had peaceful contact with the Marshallese beginning at Ebon Atoll in the mid-1850s. The atoll saw increased ship traffic and exposure to foreigners beginning, which also led to outbreaks of western diseases. In February 1859, an influenza outbreak killed several commoners on Ebon. In 1861, measles and influenza outbreaks occurred on the island, and in 1863, a typhoid fever outbreak killed several islanders.

===Missionary activity===
In 1855, American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions assigned George Pierson to its mission in Micronesia. He stopped at Ailinglaplap Atoll and met iroijlaplap Kaibuke before making his way to Kosrae, where we worked with 50 Marshallese castaways and learned the Marshallese language. In November 1857, Pierson, Edward Doane and their families returned to Marshalls to establish a mission at Ebon. The atoll&#x27;s population fluctuated as Kaibuke&#x27;s fleet came and went to exact tribute from his vassals; the frequent comings and goings from the atoll have helped to spread the missionaries&#x27; sermons to other islands. Within the first few years of the mission, the missionaries noticed social changes taking place on Ebon. Women were permitted to attend certain religious feasts for the first time, and traditional burial rites fell out of practice. While the Marshallese continued to practice tattooing, some felt guilty about the practice and stopped carrying out the rites publicly. Islanders also began to observe the Christian injunction against work on the weekly sabbath. By 1876, a traveller noted that most Marshallese women on Ebon wore western dresses and jumpers, and many men wore trousers instead of traditional grass skirts.

Pierson and his wife left Ebon for their health in 1859, and Doane left in 1863, having sent his family to Hawaii two years earlier. Both were replaced by Native Hawaiian missionaries, who ran a mission school and printed Marshallese-language bibles. Ten Ebon islanders were baptized in 1863, and the number increased to over 100 by 1870. By 1865, mission churches and schools had opened on Jaluit and Namdrik. Missions spread to Mili and Majuro in 1869, and to Arno and Maloelap Atolls by 1875, at which point more than 200 Marshall Islanders had been baptized. By the mid-1870s, most island churches were staffed by Marshall Islanders who had been trained in the mission schools.

While the church was popular among commoners, the Marshallese nobles became increasingly hostile to Christianity after Kaibuke&#x27;s death in the 1863 typhoid fever outbreak. Many of the chiefs stopped church services, and some retaliated against converts. One Marshallese noble woman burned the houses of converts. Francis Hezel speculates that the nobility may have seen increasing literacy and access to new information among the commoners as a threat to their authority, fueling increased hostility to Christianity, and notes an 1870 case in which a Christian commoner publicly chastised his island&#x27;s chief for leading young girls astray and went unpunished.

===Western commercial interests===
In 1859, the German firm Hoffschlaeger &amp; Stapenhorst sent two traders to establish a trading post at Ebon Atoll. In 1861, they built a coconut oil factory on the island. In 1863, the firm suffered serious financial setbacks and withdrew from the Marshall Islands, partially due to the sinking of one of its ships while leaving Ebon. One of the traders, , set up an independent trading firm on the island by partnering with Anton Jose DeBrum, a Portuguese whaler who arrived in 1864. Both men married local women and developed strong connections with both the Marshall Islanders and the missionaries. Their firm, Capelle &amp; Co., entered into an agreement to sell coconut copra to Godeffroy &amp; Son of Hamburg, a company which pioneered the production of copra in Samoa and Tonga and held a large share of Pacific copra trade. Godeffroy exported copra to Europe where it was processed into animal feed and coconut oil, which was used in soap and candle manufacturing. The German firms traded western goods to Marshallese chiefs in exchange for coconuts, which Marshallese commoners harvested as tribute for the chiefs.

In 1873, Capelle &amp; Co. moved its headquarters to Jaluit, which was the home of Kabua, a powerful iroij and disputed successor of Kaibuke. Godeffroy &amp; Son also established trading posts on five islands in 1873 with a main office on Jaluit, but the European stock market crash later that year caused the firm to cut back its operations. Capelle dominated the copra market in the early years, but in 1876, Hernsheim &amp; Co. and New Zealand merchant Thomas Farrell both began copra trading in the Marshall Islands. The increased competition set off a price war that disrupted the industry and proved advantageous for Marshallese suppliers. The firms also began selling the Marshallese previously prohibited goods, including alcohol, firearms, and munitions, despite the missionaries&#x27; complaints.

By 1878, Hernsheim &amp; Co. had emerged as the dominant firm in the copra trade. While Capelle &amp; Co. lost market share, Capelle and DeBrum purchased the entirety of Likiep Atoll as a copra plantation to control their buying price and supply of copra. Capelle &amp; Co. also diversified its interests to include shipbuilding and importing. Farrell went bankrupt in 1877, and his assets were acquired by Auckland firm Henderson &amp; Macfarlane. Godeffroy &amp; Son went bankrupt in 1879, and in 1880, its Pacific interests were acquired by the German Trading and Plantation Company of the South Sea Islands in Hamburg (), also known as DHPG. The world market price of copra dropped in 1882; Capelle &amp; Co. sold seven of its stations in the Marshalls to DHPG and made an agreement to exclusively sell copra to Hernsheim &amp; Co. By 1885, the German firms DHPG and Hernsheim &amp; Co. controlled two-thirds of the copra trade in the Marshall Islands, with the rest split between Henderson &amp; Macfarlane of Auckland, Crawford &amp; Co. of San Francisco, and the Pacific Navigation Company of Honolulu.

====Blackbirding====

In the 1870s, Marshall Islanders were coerced into working on plantations in other parts of the Pacific, a practice was known as &quot;blackbirding&quot;. In 1871, the ships &quot;Eugene&quot; and &quot;Carl&quot; kidnapped men at Ailinglaplap and Mili Atolls, respectively. In 1872, trader William Henry &quot;Bully&quot; Hayes kidnapped women on Mili while pirating the stations of business rivals. Several blackbirding ships cruised the northern Marshalls specifically to obtain women that they could sell into sexual slavery in Fiji. Mortality rates among Micronesian laborers in Fiji and Samoa were high, and few returned home. The labor trade in Marshall Islands declined somewhat after the British government passed the Pacific Islander Protection Act 1872, but Jaluit continued to serve as a depot for transporting Gilbertese laborers and some Marshallese were transported to Hawaiian plantations as late as 1882.

===Marshallese politics===
After the death of iroijlaplap Kaibuke during the typhoid outbreak of 1863, his two nephews Loiak and Kabua disputed who should succeed him as the paramount chief of the southern Ralik Chain. Loiak was the iroij of Ebon Atoll and the elder nephew, who traditionally would have succeeded his uncle, but Kabua, the iroij of Jaluit Atoll, married Kaibuke&#x27;s widow, making him the step-uncle and guardian of his elder cousin. Both chiefs sought support from foreigners by befriending missionaries and working with German copra traders in order to maintain influence.

The dispute remained peaceful for twelve years, but in September 1876, the conflict nearly erupted into violence. While both chiefs were staying on Ebon, copra trader James Lyle Young reported witnessing a mob of Loiak&#x27;s followers wielding muskets and preparing to attack Kabua&#x27;s followers across the lagoon. Kabua fled to his land on Jaluit rather than engaging in battle. In the following months, rumors circulated that Kabua would return and start a war. Loiak staged frequent military drills on Ebon and stockpiled weapons in late 1876, but Kabua&#x27;s invasion never occurred. In May 1880, Loiak&#x27;s followers invaded Jaluit to challenge Kabua, who prospered from the copra trade and whom an 1878 German treaty had recognized as the &quot;King of the Ralik Islands.&quot; The two armies met and carried firearms but did not fight, and there were no casualties. Loiak&#x27;s followers returned to Ebon several days later; Kabua fled to his home at Ailinglaplap Atoll, though he later returned to Jaluit.

In the late 1870s and 1880s, armed conflicts occurred between rival chiefs on both the Majuro and Arno Atolls. On Majuro, iroij Jebrik and Rimi fought over the paramount chieftainship for several years, leaving at least 10 islanders dead before Cyprian Bridge of the passing British warship HMS &quot;Espiegle&quot; mediated a peace treaty in 1883. In 1884, Bridge also negotiated an end to a conflict between iroij Lekman and Lijiwirak on Arno, which had been ongoing since 1878. Both conflicts had disrupted copra production and caused famines as war parties destroyed rivals&#x27; coconut groves and other property. Copra traders resorted to selling firearms and ammunition to maintain profits.

===Western political interests===
In 1875, the British and German governments conducted a series of secret negotiations to divide the western Pacific in spheres of influence and counter American expansion in the region. Germany received northeastern New Guinea, the Bismarck Archipelago, and several island groups of Micronesia, including the Marshall Islands. On November 26, 1878, the German warship SMS &quot;Ariadne&quot; anchored at Jaluit to begin treaty negotiations with the iroij of the Ralik Chain. During the second day of negotiations, Captain ordered his men to give a military demonstration featuring a bayonet charge, a rapid firing demonstration, and use of artillery blanks, which he later said was intended to &quot;show the islanders, who have not seen anything like it before, the power of the Europeans.&quot; On November 29, Werner signed a treaty with Kabua and several other Ralik Chain iroij which granted the German Empire &quot;most favored nation&quot; status in the Ralik Chain and required iroij to guarantee the rights of German citizens. Germany secured a fuelling station at Jaluit and free use of the atoll&#x27;s harbor for German vessels. The German authorities also recognized Kabua as the &quot;King of the Ralik Islands,&quot; though the treaty required that disputes between Marshallese and Germans would be arbitrated by German ship captains.

The German Empire established a consulate on Jaluit in 1880 with Franz Hernsheim, co-founder of Hernsheim &amp; Co., serving as the German consul to the Ralik Chain. The United States made Adolph Capelle its consul to protect the interests of American missionaries.

==German protectorate==

Franz Hernsheim and other German business interests petitioned their government to annex the Marshall Islands into the German Empire. The United Kingdom was the primary naval power in the Pacific, and the British government agreed to German annexation of the Marshalls in exchange for German recognition of Britain&#x27;s authority over the Gilbert and Ellice Islands. On August 29, 1885, Chancellor Otto von Bismarck authorized the creation of the German Protectorate of the Marshall Islands.

On October 13, 1885, the German corvette docked at Jaluit to obtain the signatures of iroij on a treaty of protection. On October 15, iroij Kabua, Loiak, Nelu, Lagajime, and Launa signed a treaty in German and Marshallese. While the Marshallese text made no distinction of rank between the five chiefs, the German text recognized Kabua as the King of the Marshall Islands, despite the ongoing dispute between Kabua and Loiak over the paramount chieftainship. A company of marines hoisted the flag of the German Empire over Jaluit, and the &quot;Nautilus&quot; performed similar ceremonies at seven other atolls in the Marshalls, obtaining the signatures of 18 iroij, most of whom were trading partners of Hernsheim. The language of the treaty framed the creation of protectorate as a request from the iroij to seek defense from colonization by other western powers and to continue German trade. Several pro-American iroij refused to recognize the German authority until threatened with naval force in mid-1886.

In April 1886, the Reichstag passed a law to create a legal foundation for colonial protectorates, giving the kaiser and his appointed governor the authority to make laws by ordinance which did not necessarily have to follow the imperial constitution. In September 1886, an imperial ordinance established the Protectorate of the Marshall Islands, and declared that German consular law would apply to all residents of the Marshall Islands, including indigenous Marshallese. The ordinance also gave the German chancellor the discretionary authority to apply extraconstitutional ordinances to the Marshallese.

Following the 1886 Anglo-German Declarations, Nauru fell within the German sphere of influence in Western Pacific and was incorporated into the Marshall Islands protectorate on April 16, 1888.

===The Jaluit Company===

Bismarck planned to leave the administration of colonies to chartered companies rather than having the German government directly administer overseas protectorates. Hernsheim &amp; Co. and DHPG both initially opposed administering the colony, but relented to the German government in December 1887 and merged their interests to create the joint-stock Jaluit Company. The new company began administering the colony in January 1888. The company had the right to be consulted on all new laws and ordinances and nominated all colonial administrative staff, subject to approval by the German chancellor. The protectorate&#x27;s administrative staff consisted of a governor, a secretary, and six colonial police officers. The company was responsible for paying administrative expenses for the protectorate, and collected commercial license fees and an annual poll tax. The taxation system was built upon the precolonial tribute system; iroij collected the taxes in copra on the company&#x27;s behalf and were entitled to one-third of the sum total.

The Jaluit Company was the longest-lasting and most profitable German colonial joint-stock company. Profit margins rose from 5% in 1892 to 12% in 1900 and 20% in 1906. The company&#x27;s licensing fees pushed out American and British competition; Crawford &amp; Co. and Henderson &amp; Macfarlane sold their holdings to the Jaluit Company in 1893 and 1899, respectively. After acquiring the trading stations of the British Pacific Islands Company in 1901, the Jaluit Company held a monopoly in the region. Australian firm Burns, Philp &amp; Co. complained that the harbor fees it paid in Marshallese ports were excessive, and the British government protested the Jaluit Company&#x27;s practices as a violation of the Anglo-German Declarations&#x27; free-trade provision. On March 31, 1906, the German government assumed direct control and reorganized the Marshall Islands and Nauru as part of the protectorate of German New Guinea. As compensation, the Jaluit Company received a 10% share of Pacific Phosphate Company, which began mining operations on Nauru that year. The company generated the largest dividends of any German company in the Pacific through the phosphate trade, rising from 30% in 1907 to 84% in 1913. Even after the monopoly ended, the company continued to dominate the Micronesian copra trade.

===Life in the protectorate===

During the protectorate period, most islanders could read and write the Marshallese language and do arthimetic. In 1898, 25 mission schools operated in the islands and had 1,300 students. The German Catholic Missionaries of the Sacred Heart arrived at Jaluit in 1899, and while few Marshallese converted to Catholicism, the Catholic schools on Jaluit, Arno, and Likiep generated high demand. While Protestant missionary schools provided a three-year education, the Catholic schools gave six to eight years, including lessons in the German language.

German accounts from the protectorate period note that aspects of pre-colonial Marshallese culture were being lost in all but the remote northern atolls with little missionary influence. Most women wore smocks or dresses instead of going bare chested and wearing skirts made from woven jaki-ed mats. Few men continued the practice of wearing their hair in a topknot. Traditional crafts such as sharkskin drums and stick charts fell out of use as western products because more readily available.

In 1900, Marshallese commoners staged a general strike to demand higher pay from the Jaluit Company. The iroij pressured most laborers to return to work, but church groups on Mejit and Namdrik organized staunch resistance to the company. The company lowered its buying price for copra from the islands, which led the islanders to cease production altogether. The German authorities arrested seven leaders of the strike and blockaded the islands from 1901 to 1904. The islanders held out, and the company doubled wages in 1904. Marshallese dockworkers on Jaluit staged a similarly successful strike in 1911 to double their wages.

The Marshallese population declined by more than 30% during the protectorate period, from 13,000-15,000 prior to annexation to 9,200 in 1908. A 1905 typhoon killed approximately 200 people on Jaluit, Arno, and Mili. Hundreds of islanders died in continued outbreaks of western diseases, such as dysentery outbreaks on Ebon which killed 150 people in 1907 and 400 in 1908. The western population remained small throughout the protectorate period. Approximately 180 westerners lived in the Marshall Islands in 1914, including 76 Germans.

==Japanese mandate==

At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, the United Kingdom and Empire of Japan were allies. Britain initially declined Japanese offers of naval assistance against Germany, because the British government wanted to prevent Japanese southward expansion into the Pacific. However, on August 7, the British Foreign Office requested that Japan help track down and destroy the German East Asia Squadron following reports of attacks on British ships. The request provided a pretext for the Imperial Japanese Navy to invade Germany&#x27;s Pacific colonies in Micronesia and Shandong.

Japanese troops under Admiral Yamaya Tanin arrived at Enewetak on September 29, 1914, and Jaluit on September 30. An occupation force of three officers and 100 Japanese troops were stationed on Jaluit on October 3. In October, the British and Japanese governments agreed that Japan would be responsible for operations north of the equator, while British, Australian and New Zealander forces operated south of the equator. The agreement placed most of German Micronesia under Japanese military control, while Nauru came under British control. In February 1917, the British and Japanese made a secret agreement that Japan would annex Micronesia after the Allied Powers won the war. Japan later made similar agreements with France, Italy, and Russia.

In January 1919, Japanese delegate Makino Nobuaki proposed that Japan annex Germany&#x27;s Pacific island colonies at the Paris Peace Conference. United States President Woodrow Wilson opposed the annexation of German colonies by the Allied Powers and argued for a system of League of Nations mandates. The Australian delegates opposed Wilson&#x27;s proposal, and the conference adopted a compromise under which mandates would be divided into classes based on size and level of development. Germany&#x27;s Pacific colonies north of the equator became the Japanese South Seas Mandate, a Class C mandate, which due to small size, sparse population, remoteness, and low level of development was to be governed under Japanese laws as if it were an integral part of Japanese territory. Germany ceded the Marshall Islands to Japan with the signing of the Treaty of Versailles on June 28, 1919. In August 1919, a commission determined that mandates were also not to be militarized and that Japan was not to continue expanding its territory further into the Pacific.

The United States government and military opposed Japanese annexation of Germany&#x27;s Micronesian colonies and were suspicious of a secret Japanese military build up in Micronesia. The government recruited some of the few American scientists in Micronesia to gather strategic information. In 1921, geologist William Herbert Hobbs gathered intelligence while on an expedition to collect coral and volcanic samples in the Marshall Islands. In 1922 and 1923, American intelligence officer Earl Hancock Ellis posed as a commercial traveler and undertook a reconnaissance tour of Micronesia, including several months the Marshall Islands.

===Administration===
In December 1914, the Japanese military created the Provisional South Seas Defense Force to administer Micronesia from its command post at Truk Atoll. The military administration divided Micronesia into six naval districts, each governed by a commander: the central Carolines, governed from Truk; the eastern Carolines, governed from Ponape; the Marianas, governed from Saipan; the Marshalls, governed from Jaluit; Palau, governed from Koror; and Yap. The administration had orders to initially retain as many German-era laws as possible to enable a smooth transition to Japanese rule, though Japanese laws replaced German laws in 1915. The Japanese initially requested that German officials continue to work on behalf of the Japanese occupation, but later reversed course and deported most German settlers and officials in June 1915.

The military government implemented an embargo on most foreign ships, including those of its allies, from anchoring at harbors in the Marshall Islands. Non-Japanese foreigners needed to file a multi-step application to visit the islands with no guarantee that the government would grant permission. International mail service to Micronesia halted from 1914 to 1917 and resumed after the Anglo-Japanese secret agreement that Japan would retain the territories it had occupied after the war.

During the first months of the occupation, Japanese scientists, agricultural researchers, medical specialists and other experts and scholars conducted an extensive survey of German Micronesia to assess the islands&#x27; economic potential. The survey&#x27;s final report to the Japanese government suggested that the islands&#x27; primary value was strategic, because they could enable future southward expansion. In other parts of Micronesia the Japanese undertook novel development initiatives, but the Marshall Islands had the most limited economic potential in Micronesia. The Japanese adopted the German system of having local iroij collect a poll tax in copra.

The Japanese navy garrisons withdrew from Micronesia and closed their headquarters at Truk in 1921, and the civilian led by Toshiro Tezuka set up its headquarters in Koror, Palau, in April 1922. The Marshall Islands were one of six branch governments of the civil administration, and the administrative center of the district remained in Jaluit. The South Seas Government reported directly to the Prime Minister of Japan until 1929, when the government came under the authority of the Ministry of Colonial Affairs. The Japanese administration employed a much larger staff than the Germans. They also attempted to weaken the iroij by prohibiting any chief from having landholdings on more than one island. The government controlled most of the land on Jaluit, but the other Marshall Islands were among the only places in the South Seas Mandate where the government did not directly control the majority of the land.

===Relations with Marshall Islanders===
The government undertook a propaganda campaign to convince Micronesians that Japanese and Micronesian people were the same race, and the authorities encouraged the Marshallese to assimilate into Japanese culture. In 1915, the military administration instituted a three-year public school system that provided education the Japanese language and gradually replaced the missionary schools. Students were forbidden to speak Marshallese in the schools and could receive corporal punishment for not speaking Japanese. More than half of school lessons were devoted to Japanese language and cultural instruction. The government implemented a system of using boats to transport students from smaller and more remote islands to schools on the larger islands, and school books and materials were free. By 1935, public school attendance was mandatory for all children within range of a school.

The government also sponsored devoted to Japanese activities, such as track and field, baseball, handicrafts, and song competitions. Beginning in 1915, elite Marshall Islanders received free trips to Japan to expose them to Japanese culture. Students also received tours of Japan from 1917. Islanders were responsible for some of the costs of the trips from 1926, and the tour program continued until 1939.

In practice, Japanese colonial policies treated the Marshallese as second-class citizens. Schools for Marshallese students provided a shorter education than schools for Japanese settlers in the mandate. Post-primary education for many islanders was restricted to vocational training. Few islanders could get employment in the colonial bureaucracy and they tended to receive lower wages than Japanese settlers performing the same jobs.

The Japanese had less presence and impact on the remoter atolls, where only one or two traders might be in residence at any time. Islanders on remote islands had infrequent interactions with Japanese fishermen and colonial policemen. However, islanders in remote villages gained increased access to Japanese manufactured goods through the copra trade.

The islands of the South Seas Mandate featured in the popular culture of interwar Japan. One of the earliest examples was the song , which tells the story of a Japanese man who is rescued from drowning by a Marshallese woman. He falls in love with her and dances at a headhunter feast to win her hand in marriage. The song was adapted as a 1930 film of the same title. Scholars such as Naoto Sudo and Michael Baskett have argued that the story presents a contrast between romance and exoticized peril. Other Japanese media set in an exoticized fantasy of the South Seas Islands included the popular songs &quot;Banana Maiden&quot; and &quot;South Seas Maiden&quot; as well as the manga series &quot;Daring Dankichi&quot;.

===Japanese settlement and development===

The Marshall Islands were the largest producer of copra in the Japanese mandate, copra being the Marshalls&#x27; largest industry as well as the second most important commodity in the mandate after sugarcane, which was largely produced in the Northern Mariana Islands. Other industries also grew in the Marshalls during the period, including phosphorus mining on Ebon as well as commercial tuna fishing and canning.

The Jaluit Company ceased operations in March 1915, and the Japanese , also called NBK, and the Australian Burns, Philp &amp; Co. took over the copra trade. NBK was able to build upon and expand the commercial infrastructure that German companies had built in the islands. The Japanese navy also granted NBK a monopoly on transporting military provisions and personnel between Japan and the islands. In 1918, the authorities attempted to increase copra yield by declaring that all land which had not been planted with coconut trees within three years would become government property.

Japanese, Koreans, and Okinawans settled in the Marshall Islands, although they formed one of the smallest settler communities in the South Seas Mandate. In 1937, the immigrant population of the Marshalls was approximately 500, while Palau had 11,000, and Truk and Ponape had 3,600 each. Marshall Islanders remained the majority of the population throughout the mandate period, unlike Palau and the Mariana Islands, where Japanese settlers became the majority. While cities significantly grew and developed in other parts of the Japanese mandate, the administrative center at Jabor, Jaluit, grew more modestly during the Japanese period. The town included port infrastructure, government offices, NBK offices and warehouses, a post office, a public school, a communications post, a hospital, a power plant, and a settlement of Okinawan fishermen, but lacked many of the commercial businesses and social establishments built in areas with larger immigrant populations. While the immigrant labor force was small, their presence drove wages in the Marshall Islands down to pre-German colonial levels.

===Military buildup===
On March 27, 1933, Japan declared its intentions to withdraw from the League of Nations after the league denounced the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. Japan officially withdrew from the league in 1935 but continued to control the islands. Japan maintained an ambiguous policy about the Pacific Islands until World War II, signaling that it intended to continue administering the islands while also remaining silent about whether the islands had become Japanese territory.

Japan began rearming and building up its military following its invasion of China in 1937. The Japanese navy reestablished itself in the South Seas Mandate that year and undertook the construction of civilian airfields. Military planners initially discounted the Marshalls as too distant and indefensible for extensive fortification, but as Japan developed long-range bombers, the islands became useful as a forward base to attack Australia, British colonies, and the United States. In 1939 and 1940, the navy built airfields on Kwajalein, Maloelap, and Wotje Atolls as well as seaplane facilities at Jaluit. The navy also expanded and modernized ports in the Marshalls. In February 1941, ships and troops of the Japanese 4th Fleet began arriving to garrison the newly fortified islands. The Japanese headquarters in Marshalls were at Kwajalein.

The government conscripted hundreds of Korean laborers to build the airfields and ports. Marshallese men were also conscripted to work in military camps.

==World War II==

At the outbreak of the Pacific War, the Japanese air raids and landing parties of the Battle of Wake Island launched from Kwajalein, and the Japanese invasions of the Gilbert Islands and Nauru both launched from Jaluit. On February 1, 1942, the United States Pacific Fleet carried out the Marshalls–Gilberts raids, which struck Jaluit, Kwajalein, Maloelap, and Wotje. They were the first American air raids on Japanese territory.

By 1943, the Japanese navy had built airfields on Enewatak and Mili Atolls in addition to the pre-war airfields at Kwajalein, Maloelap, and Wotje.

The American invasion of the Marshall Islands began on January 31, 1944, during the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign. The Americans simultaneously invaded Majuro and Kwajalein. By autumn 1944, the Americans controlled all of the Marshall Islands, except for Jaluit, Maloelap, Mili, and Wotje. As the American campaign advanced through Micronesia and into the Ryukyu Islands, the four Japanese-held atolls were cut off from supplies and subject to American bombardment. The garrisons began running out of provisions in late 1944, leading to high casualties from starvation and disease. Of the 4700-man Japanese garrison on the Mili Atoll, 1600 died from starvation and disease while an additional 900 died in American air raids.

==Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands==

Following capture and occupation by the United States during World War II, the Marshall Islands, along with several other island groups located in Micronesia, passed formally to the United States under United Nations auspices in 1947 as part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands established pursuant to Security Council Resolution 21.

===United States nuclear testing===

From 1946 to 1958, the early years of the Cold War, the United States tested 67 nuclear weapons at its Pacific Proving Grounds located in the Marshall Islands, including the largest atmospheric nuclear test ever conducted by the U.S., code named Castle Bravo. &quot;The bombs had a total yield of 108,496 kilotons, over 7,200 times more powerful than the atomic weapons used during World War II.&quot; With the 1952 test of the first U.S. hydrogen bomb, code named &quot;Ivy Mike,&quot; the island of Elugelab in the Enewetak atoll was destroyed. In 1956, the United States Atomic Energy Commission regarded the Marshall Islands as &quot;by far the most contaminated place in the world.&quot;

Nuclear claims between the U.S. and the Marshall Islands are ongoing, and health effects from these nuclear tests linger. Project 4.1 was a medical study conducted by the United States of those residents of the Bikini Atoll exposed to radioactive fallout. From 1956 to August 1998, at least $759 million was paid to the Marshallese Islanders in compensation for their exposure to U.S. nuclear weapon testing.

==Independence==


In 1979, the Government of the Marshall Islands was officially established and the country became self-governing.

In 1986, the Compact of Free Association with the United States entered into force, granting the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) its sovereignty. The Compact provided for aid and U.S. defense of the islands in exchange for continued U.S. military use of the missile testing range at Kwajalein Atoll. The independence procedure was formally completed under international law in 1990, when the UN officially ended the Trusteeship status pursuant to Security Council Resolution 683. The Republic was admitted to the UN in 1991.

In 2003, the US created a new Compact of Free Association for the Republic Marshall Islands and Micronesia, with funding of $3.5 billion to be made over the next 20 years.

A report in mid 2017 by Stanford University, some 70 years after 23 atomic bombs were detonated on Bikini Atoll, indicates abundant fish and plant life in the coral reefs. That area of the islands was still not habitable by humans, however, due to contamination by radioactivity. A 2012 report by the United Nations had indicated that the contamination was &quot;near-irreversible&quot;.

In January 2020, David Kabua, son of founding president Amata Kabua, was elected as the new President of the Marshall Islands. His predecessor Hilda Heine lost the position after a vote.

===Climate crisis===

In 2008, extreme waves and high tides caused widespread flooding in the capital city of Majuro and other urban centres, above sea level. On Christmas morning in 2008, the government declared a state of emergency. In 2013, heavy waves once again breached the city walls of Majuro.

In 2013, the northern atolls of the Marshall Islands experienced drought. The drought left 6,000 people surviving on less than of water per day. This resulted in the failure of food crops and the spread of diseases such as diarrhea, pink eye, and influenza. These emergencies resulted in the United States President declaring an emergency in the islands. This declaration activated support from US government agencies under the Republic&#x27;s &quot;free association&quot; status with the United States, which provides humanitarian and other vital support.

Following the 2013 emergencies, the Minister of Foreign Affairs Tony deBrum was encouraged by the Obama administration in the United States to turn the crises into an opportunity to promote action against climate change. DeBrum demanded new commitment and international leadership to stave off further climate disasters from battering his country and other similarly vulnerable countries. In September 2013, the Marshall Islands hosted the 44th Pacific Islands Forum summit. DeBrum proposed a Majuro Declaration for Climate Leadership to galvanize concrete action on climate change.

Rising sea levels are threatening the islands which may render some uninhabitable if sea levels continue to rise. Major flooding occurred in 2014 leading to a state of emergency for Majuro. Thousands of islanders have already moved to the US over the past decades for medical treatment and for better education or employment, many settling in Arkansas; emigration is likely to increase as sea levels rise. The right of residents to do so ends in 2023 unless the Compact with the US is renewed. The United States Geological Survey in 2014 warned that rising sea levels will salinize the fresh water on the islands, &quot;thus likely forcing inhabitants to abandon their islands in decades, not centuries, as previously thought&quot;.

<doc id="57004" wikidata="Q261643" url="?curid=57004" title="Economy of Tuvalu">
<text>Tuvalu is a Polynesian island nation located in the Pacific Ocean, midway between Hawaii and Australia, with a population of 11,192 per the 2017 census. The economy of Tuvalu is constrained by its remoteness and lack of economies of scale. Government revenues largely come from fishing licences (primarily paid under the South Pacific Tuna Treaty); direct grants from international donors (government donors as well as from the Asian Development Bank); and income from the Tuvalu Trust Fund. The lease of its highly fortuitous .tv Top Level Domain (TLD) also contributes revenue. The sale of stamps since the independence of Tuvalu in 1976 has been an important source of revenue for the country and government. However, such revenue has significantly declined in recent years. Tuvalu has hardly any tourism. It has no tour guides, tour operators, or organised activities, and no cruise ships visit.

World Bank Statistics outline that in 2010 Tuvalu produced a bottom-tier ranking Gross Domestic Product of $31,350,804 and Gross National Income of $4,760, compared to other Pacific SIDS states such as Kiribati at $2,010 and the Marshall Islands at $3,640. A large proportion of national income comes from the employment of 15% of adult male Tuvaluans overseas in the maritime industry. The value of these remittances was valued at A$4 million (est. 2006) and on average accounts for 10% of GDP. A UN Report makes reference to the fact that these revenue streams are vulnerable to macroeconomic change while the national budget remains heavily subsidised through international aid and funding schemes such as the Tuvalu Trust Fund with a strong reliance on the importation of food, which was estimated at $15.5 million in 2007.

The Tuvalu Trust Fund was established in 1987 by the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand to help supplement national deficits, underpin economic development, and help the nation achieve greater financial autonomy. The Fund has contributed roughly A$79 million, 15% of the annual government budget each year since 1990. With a capital value of about 2.5 times GDP, the Trust Fund provides an important cushion for Tuvalu&#x27;s volatile income sources from fishing and royalties from the sale of the .tv domain. Tuvalu joined the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on 24 June 2010.

On 5 August 2012, the executive board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded that a slow recovery was underway in Tuvalu and that GDP grew in 2011 led by the private retail sector and education spending.

The increase in inflation in 2022 was due to the rapid rise in the cost of food resulting from a drought that affected food production and from rising global food prices, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (food imports represent 19 percent of Tuvalu’s GDP, while agriculture makes up for only 10 percent of GDP). The government declared a national state of emergency in November 2022 as a consequence of a drought that exhausted rainwater supplies. The government responded to the rising inflation through untargeted “inflation mitigation payouts” (totalling AUD 400,000 or AUD 40 dollars per eligible household) and by expanding a list of products under price controls. In 2023, the IMF Article IV consultation with Tuvalu concluded that a successful vaccination strategy allowed Tuvalu to lift coronavirus disease (COVID-19) containment measures at the end of 2022. However, the economic cost of the pandemic was significant, with real gross domestic product growth falling from 13.8% in 2019 to -4.3 percent in 2020, although it recovered to 1.8% in 2021. Inflation rose to 11.5% in 2022, but inflation is projected to fall to 2.8% by 2028.

==Geography of Tuvalu==

Agriculture in Tuvalu is focused on coconut trees and growing pulaka in large pits of composted soil below the water table. Subsistence farming of coconut palms to produce copra and fishing remain the primary economic activities, particularly off the capital island of Funafuti. There is no apparent large income disparity among the residents, although virtually the only jobs in the islands that pay a steady wage or salary are with the government, which make up about two-thirds of those in formal employment. About 15% of adult males work as seamen on foreign-flagged merchant ships. Population growth on the outer islands, the limits as to available land and the lack of employment opportunities, results in a flow of people from the outer islands to the capital in Funafuti with further pressure to migrate to Australia or New Zealand. There is high youth unemployment and few new jobs being created. Given the absence of natural resources (apart from tuna in the territorial waters), and the constraints imposed on the Tuvaluan economy by its remoteness and lack of economies of scale, practical policies are needed for improvements to the livelihoods of the growing numbers of young Tuvaluans who aspire to a more affluent lifestyle than older generations.

Tuvalu comprises four reef islands and five true atolls that result in a &quot;contiguous zone:&quot; &quot;exclusive economic zone:&quot; &quot;territorial sea:&quot; . Its nearest neighbours are Kiribati, Nauru, Samoa and Fiji. Tuvalu has worked with Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC) and the European Union and enacted the Seabed Minerals Act 2014. The SPC-EU Pacific Deep Sea Minerals Project involves cooperation between the Cook Islands, Fiji, Tonga and Tuvalu with the object of those countries making informed decisions about future deep seabed mineral activities.

The population is 10,507 (2017 Census), which makes Tuvalu the third-least populous sovereign state in the world; as compared to its immediate neighbours, it has a larger population than Nauru, but is smaller than Kiribati which has a permanent population of just over 100,000 (2011). In terms of physical land size, at just Tuvalu is the fourth smallest country in the world; as compared to its immediate neighbours, Tuvalu is larger than Nauru, which is , and smaller than Kiribati, which comprises groups of atolls dispersed over 3.5 million square kilometres, (1,351,000 square miles) of the Pacific Ocean. Tuvalu&#x27;s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) covers an oceanic area of approximately 900,000 km2.

Tuvalu is considered a safe country of unspoiled natural beauty and friendly people. However, due to its remoteness, the cost of travelling to the island and limited air traffic to the country, limited numbers of tourists visit each year. The majority of visitors to Tuvalu are government officials, aid workers, NGO officials or consultants.

==Tuvalu&#x27;s economy==
===Fishing resources===
Tuvaluans are primarily involved in traditional agriculture and fishing. Job opportunities also exist as observers on tuna boats where the role is to monitor compliance with the boat&#x27;s tuna fishing licence.

The Tuvaluan economy, therefore, relies heavily on its fishing income, with 42% of the Tuvaluan population involved in fishing activity at various levels. The fishing in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) mainly consists of Skipjack Tuna, Yellowfin Tuna and Bigeye Tuna. UN Data calculated a gross value of fisheries at US$43,773,582 (2007 est), which accounted for the output of coastal commercial fishing, coastal subsistence fishing, locally based offshore fishing, foreign-based offshore fishing, freshwater fishing and aquaculture. In recent years all of the income has been generated through the listed activities in Tuvalu waters, rather than through exports direct from Tuvalu. The activities of international fishing vessels, which in 2008 comprised 42 longline fishing vessels, 3 pole/line vessels and 126 purse seiners, far outweigh domestic activity, with a production volume of 35,541 tonnes worth US$40,924,370 (2009 est) or 93.5% of gross value, although Tuvalu retains a sizeable share in income via licensing. Fishing licensing agreements with Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, New Zealand and the United States generated an income of A$9 million in 2009. In 2013 revenue from fishing licenses doubled to more than 45% of GDP.

On 29 June 2017, the National Fishing Corporation of Tuvalu (NAFICOT), signed a joint venture agreement with the Republic of Korea&#x27;s SAJO Fishing Industry to operate the fishing vessel &quot;M.V. Taina&quot; within the Tuvaluan EEZ and other Pacific Island waters.

The 2021 Budget of Tuvalu set out a shift in government policy regarding engagement in fishing activities, with a shift from joint venture arrangements (including the sale of &quot;FV Taumoana&quot; for $10.4 million) to just receiving revenue from fishing licenses and receiving management fees for flagged ships.

===Remittances from Tuvaluan seafarers===

Tuvalu men have for some time been employed abroad, working on container ships, primarily on German-owned ships. Remittances from seafarers is a major source of income for their families in Tuvalu. In 2002, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved an assistance package to upgrade the Tuvalu Maritime Training Institute (TMTI) which trains young Tuvaluans so they can work aboard foreign vessels. This project was completed in 2011.

The Great Recession impacted global export-import activities and the demand for shipping, which reduced the need for Tuvaluan seafarers.

The 1991 census identified 272 seaman working on merchant ships. In 2002 the Tuvaluan Overseas Seaman&#x27;s Union (TOSU) estimated the number as 417 seaman working on ships. In 2011 the ADB estimated there were 800 TMTI graduates registered for employment as seafarers. The ADB identified that the number of Tuvaluans employed as seafarers has decreased steadily from about 340 in 2001 to only 205 in 2010; so that of a total pool of 800 qualified seafarers, including those on leave, almost 450 were unemployed. This decline in seafarer employment has reduced remittances from $2.4 million in 2001 to a projected $1.2 million in 2010. The International Labour Organization (ILO) also estimates that in 2010 there were approximately 200 Tuvaluan seafarers on ships. The International Monetary Fund 2014 Country Report described the effect of the GFC as reducing demand for the services of Tuvaluan seafarers. As of October 2013, there were about 112 Tuvalu seafarers working on cargo ships, compared to 361 in 2006. The consequence is that remittances from seafarers to their families in Tuvalu fell by about 9% of GDP for Tuvalu. In 2012 such remittances were 10% of GDP for Tuvalu.

While a budget deficit of A$0.4 million was projected for 2015, the ADB assessed the budget as being A$14.3m in surplus as the result of high tuna fish license fees. The ADB predicted that the 2% growth rate for 2015 would continue into 2016.

===Economic vulnerability===

From 1996 to 2002, Tuvalu was one of the best performing Pacific Island economies and achieved an average real gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate of 5.6% per annum. Since 2002 economic growth has slowed as Tuvalu was exposed to rapid rises in world prices of fuel and food with the level of inflation peaking at 10% in 2008, and falling to 0% in November 2010.

However, due to the acute level of geographic, macroeconomic and financial isolation, scale of area, population infrastructure and agriculture, climate change, oil dependency, contracting GDP and economic dependency many sources in this decade view Tuvalu as an extremely vulnerable economy. The country is also dependent on imported fuel, with gas prices quoted at $12/gal (2009). The high cost of petroleum products has encouraged the development of projects to access renewable energy in Tuvalu.

Although listed by the UN as a Lower Middle Income LDC, it scores very high in terms of Economic Vulnerability Index, with a rating of 79.7 out of 100 in 2009, leading the UN to state that Tuvalu is the most &quot;economically vulnerable country in the world&quot;. Due to the factors addressed earlier, Tuvalu yields limited revenue from exports.

==Public sector enterprises==

The public sector enterprises are the National Fishing Corporation of Tuvalu (NAFICOT), National Bank of Tuvalu, Development Bank of Tuvalu, Tuvalu Electricity Corporation, Tuvalu Telecommunications Corporation, Tuvalu Philatelic Bureau, Tuvalu Maritime Training Institute and Vaiaku Lagi Hotel.

The government is the primary provider of medical services through Princess Margaret Hospital on Funafuti, which operates medical clinics on the other islands.

Banking services are provided by the National Bank of Tuvalu. Effective of 7 October 2016, Tuvalu accepted the Article VIII obligations of the IMF Articles of Agreement, to maintaining an exchange system free of restrictions on payments for international transactions.

The Tuvalu Media Department of the Government of Tuvalu operates one station on the AM frequencies under the title of &quot;Radio Tuvalu&quot;. &quot;Fenui – news from Tuvalu&quot; is a free digital publication of the Tuvalu Media Department that is emailed to subscribers and operates a Facebook page, which publishes news about government activities and news about Tuvaluan events, such as a special edition covering the results of the 2015 general election.

The Tuvalu National Provident Fund (TNPF) and the Copra Trading Co-operative (CTC) are owned by the members of each organisation. 
The TNPF provides its members with loans, for which each member&#x27;s account is used as collateral. The Tuvalu Cooperative Society is the main wholesaler and retailer in Tuvalu.

==Private sector enterprises==
The Tuvalu National Private Sector Organisation, the Tuvalu National Chamber of Commerce and Tuvalu Business Centre are active in supporting private sector enterprises. In order to set up a business in Tuvalu, an investor needs a start-up capital of AUD$20,000, a Tuvaluan partner and pay a business registration fee of AUD$100. As of 2010 there are only seven foreign-owned businesses operating in Tuvalu, which were mostly set up by Asian small business operators in the retail and restaurant sector.

Mackenzie Trading Limited, established by Mackenzie Kiritome in 2008, operates small retail outlets in the outer islands to sell merchandise in competition with the Co-operative Society (which is a community-owned enterprise). In 2010 Mackenzie Trading Limited employed 40 people. Other supermarkets on Funafuti include the Edwin Food City store, the Messamasui Supermarket, the SULANI Trading store and the JY Ocean Trading stores. Government regulations prohibit trading on Sundays.

==Development of economic and social policy (&quot;Te Kakeega&quot;/&quot;Te Kete&quot;)==

&quot;Te Kakeega&quot; was the statement of the national strategy for the sustainable development of Tuvalu, with economic and social goals intended to be achieved in the period 2005 to 2015. After consultations on each islands the National Summit on Sustainable Development (NSSD), was held at the &quot;Tausoalima Falekaupule&quot; in Funafuti from 28 June to 9 July 2004. The meeting resulted in the &quot;Malefatuga&quot; Declaration, which is the foundation of &quot;Te Kakeega II - National Strategy for Sustainable Development-2005-2015&quot;, which “contained all the known aid projects, programmes, development initiatives and ideas adopted by the donors and the two successive Tuvalu governments (2004-2006 and 2006 to present)”.

The &quot;Te Kakeega III - National Strategy for Sustainable Development 2016-2020&quot; (TK III) includes new strategic areas, in addition to the eight identified in TK II. The additional strategic areas are climate change; environment; migration and urbanization; and oceans and seas.

In the national strategy plan for 2021–2030, the name &quot;Te Kakeega&quot; was replaced by &quot;Te Kete&quot; which is the name of a domestic traditional basket woven from green or brown coconut leaves. Symbolically, &quot;Te Kete&quot; has biblical significance for Tuvaluan Christian traditions by referencing the basket or the cradle that saved the life of Moses.

==Tuvalu Trust Fund==
The Tuvalu Trust Fund (TTF) was established in 1987 by the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand with about A$27 million in capital. The TTF, a prudently managed overseas investment fund, has contributed roughly (A$79 million), 15% of the annual government budget each year since 1990. With a capital value of about 3.5 times GDP, the TTF provides an important cushion for Tuvalu&#x27;s volatile income sources from fishing and royalties from the sale of the dot-TV domain.

The IMF 2014 Country Report noted the market value of the TTF dropped during the Great Recession, however by 2014 the total value of the fund had recovered to more than $A140 million (3.5 times GDP). In 2018 the TTF amounted to about A$179 million. In 2021 the TTF amounted to about A$192 million. In 2021 the market value of the TTF rose by 12 percent to its highest level on record (261 percent of GDP). However, the volatility in global equity markets in 2022 resulted in the TTF’s value falling to A$191 million.

The capital of the Trust Fund is known as the “A Account”. The &quot;B Account&quot; or “Consolidated Investment Fund” (CIF) is a revolving “buffer account” that receives funds from the returns or “disbursements” of the &quot;A Account&quot;. The operation of the Trust Fund through two accounts assists in stabilising the long-term financial situation of the Government of Tuvalu as well as addressing short-term budget needs. The &quot;B Account&quot;, which belongs exclusively to the Government, holds income distributions from the &quot;A Account&quot; until funds are needed to be used for the national budget. It, therefore, serves as a buffer against the volatility of the ‘A Account’ returns, i.e., during years when there are no returns or low returns. Brian Bell, a member of the Tuvalu Trust Fund Advisory Committee from the inception of the Trust Fund in 1987 to 2002, describes the purpose of the Trust Fund as being:

:“The Tuvalu Trust Fund was aimed at providing a source of revenue to overcome a chronic budget deficit situation. The revenue is distributed to the Government from the A Account to the B Account. The amount needed is then drawn down into the consolidated revenue account as an additional source of revenue for expenditure on government services through the recurrent budget.”

The 20th-anniversary review of the Tuvalu Trust Fund described the performance as being that:
:“In the first twenty years of operation the Fund has grown to $106.6 million in Market Value as of 30 June 2007. The real rate of return on the Fund has averaged 6.2 percent per annum providing $65.7 million in revenue to Tuvalu. Of this $24.1 million has been used to help fund budget deficits, $29.2 million has been reinvested in the Fund and $12.4 million is held in the CIF awaiting drawdown as of 30 June 2007. The Government&#x27;s subsequent reinvestments back into the Fund since inception raises Tuvalu&#x27;s contributions to the Fund to $29.8 million including the initial contribution of $1.6 million. It makes Tuvalu the major contributor to the Fund, which is evidence of Tuvalu&#x27;s commitment to the long term sustainability of the Fund.”

==Falekaupule Trust Fund==
In 1999 the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the government of Tuvalu set up the Falekaupule Trust Fund, which is intended to improve services on the outer islands. The island councils – composed of traditional leaders – are responsible for managing their own finances from a budget allocated from the Tuvaluan government from the Falekaupule Trust Fund. Under the Falekaupule Act, &quot;Falekaupule&quot; means “traditional assembly in each island...composed in accordance with the Aganu of each island”. &quot;Aganu&quot; means traditional custom and culture. The initial capital of Falekaupule Trust Fund was A$12 million. The market value of the FTF has increased:

:“As at 30 June 2007, the FTF&#x27;s market value stood at $25.3 million. After eight years of operation, the FTF has made three distributions totalling to $4.7 million. A Reserve Account was established in 2005 having the exact same purpose as the CIF, which is to smooth out the stream of revenue from the main investment. At 30 June 2007, the FTF&#x27;s Reserve Account was $1.4 million.”

The Great Recession affected the FTF, which is required to maintain its value in real terms before a distribution can be made. As of 30 September 2010, the maintained value was $27.3 million; the result of capital growth and contributions from development partners. This is some $3.5 million higher than the market value of $23.8 million. The gap of 15% between the market value and the maintained value must be recouped before another distribution can be made. Since the commencement of FTF, there have been four years in which distributions were made. The FTF has distributed $6.4 million with some $5.3 million allocated to island development (the balance of $1.1 million is held in reserve by the communities). This equates to an average of $55,000 spent per island per year.

==Government revenue==
Government revenues largely come from sales of stamps and coins, fishing licences, income from the Tuvalu Ship Registry, income from the TTF, and from the lease of its highly fortuitous .tv Internet Top Level Domain (TLD).

===Tuvalu Trust Fund===

The Tuvalu Trust Fund was established for the intended purpose of helping to supplement national deficits, underpin economic development, and help the nation achieve greater financial autonomy. The Trust Fund, has contributed roughly (A$79 million) 15% of the annual government budget each year since 1990. With a capital value of about 2.5 times GDP, the Trust Fund provides an important cushion for Tuvalu&#x27;s volatile income sources from fishing and royalties from the sale of the .tv domain. Meeting the needs of the 2013/14 budget of the Tuvaluan Government will require drawing from funds held in the “Consolidated Investment Fund” (CIF) of the Tuvalu Trust Fund.

===Fishing Licenses===
Fishing licences are an important source of revenue. The fishing in the 900,000 km2 of water area mainly consists of Skipjack Tuna, Yellowfin Tuna and Bigeye Tuna. Payments from US government made under the South Pacific Tuna Treaty (SPTT) was about $9 million in 1999. In May 2013 representatives from the United States and the Pacific Islands countries agreed to sign interim arrangement documents to extend the Multilateral Fisheries Treaty (which encompasses the South Pacific Tuna Treaty) to confirm access to the fisheries in the Western and Central Pacific for US tuna boats for 18 months. In 2015 Tuvalu has refused to sell fishing days to certain nations and fleets that have blocked Tuvaluan initiatives to develop and sustain their own fishery. In 2016 Dr Puakena Boreham, the Minister of Natural Resources, drew attention to Article 30 of the WCPF Convention, which describes the collective obligation of members to consider the disproportionate burden that management measures might place on small-island developing states.

===.tv Domain===
The &quot;.tv&quot; domain name generates around A$7 million each year from royalties. In 2019, 8.4% of total government revenue came from .tv royalties. The domain name is sought after due to its similarity to the abbreviation of the word television.
VeriSign, Inc managed the .tv domain with the agreement running until 2021. On 14 December 2021 the Ministry of Justice, Communication and Foreign Affairs of the Tuvalu Government announced that they had selected GoDaddy Registry as the new registry service provider, after Verisign did not participate in the process.
The success of Twitch.tv and other esports and video game platforms means that Tuvalu can expect to derive increased revenue from the domain.

===Economic Assessment===
The Asian Development Bank described the Global Economic Crisis (GEC) as impacting on Tuvalu through: “(i) lower demand for Tuvalu seafarers and, therefore, falling remittances; (ii) volatile exchange rate movements affecting the value of remittances, revenues from fishing licence fees, and food prices; and (iii) lower market value of the Tuvalu Trust Fund (TTF), which at the end of May 2010 was about 12% below the maintained value. Thus, as a direct result of the GEC, no distribution was made from the fund to the budget for 2010 and further distributions are unlikely while there is uncertainty in international financial markets.”

The IMF 2010 Country Report describes economic activity in Tuvalu as dampened by lower offshore earnings, with “[t]he economy is expected to have almost no growth in 2010, and growth is projected to be zero or even turn negative in 2011, led by lower government spending, and remain low over the medium term.”

The IMF 2014 Country Report noted that real GDP growth had been volatile averaging only 1 percent in the past decade. The 2014 Country Report describes economic growth prospects as generally positive as the result of large revenues from fishing licenses, together with substantial foreign aid, &quot;while, over the medium to long run, growth prospects may be hampered by the dominance of inefficient public enterprise in the economy, uncertainty in the fisheries sector, and weak competitiveness.&quot;

The IMF 2021 Country Report concluded that swift implementation of COVID-19 containment measures and COVID-related fiscal spending financed by buoyant fishing revenues and donor grants have allowed Tuvalu to avoid a recession in 2020.

==Least developed country status==
The United Nations designates Tuvalu as a least developed country because of its limited potential for economic development, absence of exploitable resources and its small size and vulnerability to external economic and environmental shocks. Tuvalu participates in the Enhanced Integrated Framework for Trade-Related Technical Assistance to Least Developed Countries, which was established in October 1997 under the auspices of the World Trade Organisation. In 2013 Tuvalu deferred its graduation from least developed country status to a developing country to 2015. Prime Minister Enele Sopoaga said that this deferral was necessary to maintain access by Tuvalu to the funds provided by the United Nations&#x27;s National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA), as &quot;Once Tuvalu graduates to a developed country, it will not be considered for funding assistance for climate change adaptation programmes like NAPA, which only goes to LDCs&quot;. Tuvalu had met targets so that Tuvalu was to graduate from LDC status. Prime minister, Enele Sopoaga wants the United Nations to reconsider its criteria for graduation from LDC status as not enough weight is given to the environmental plight of small island states like Tuvalu in the application of the Environmental Vulnerability Index.

==International aid==
Australia and New Zealand continue to contribute capital to the Tuvalu Trust Fund and provide other forms of development assistance. Financial support to Tuvalu is also provided by Japan, South Korea and the European Union.

Tuvalu joined the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in 1993. To improve aid effectiveness, the government of Tuvalu, ADB, AusAID, and NZAID signed the Development Partners Declaration (DPD) in 2009. The DPD is designed to improve aid effectiveness, both in the implementation of specific projects and in assisting the Tuvaluan government achieve performance benchmark indicators.

Tuvalu became a member of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in July 2010 and also joined the World Bank. In 2013 the World Bank approved US$6.06 million in finance for the existing Tuvalu Aviation Investment Project (TvAIP) for the purpose of improving operational safety and oversight of international air transport and associated infrastructure at Funafuti International Airport.

Tuvalu participates in the Enhanced Integrated Framework for Trade-Related Technical Assistance to Least Developed Countries, which was established in October 1997 under the auspices of the World Trade Organisation. In 2013 Tuvalu deferred its graduation from Least Developed Country status to a developing country to 2015. Prime Minister Enele Sopoaga said that this deferral was necessary to maintain access by Tuvalu to the funds provided by the United Nations&#x27;s National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA), as “Once Tuvalu graduates to a developed country, it will not be considered for funding assistance for climate change adaptation programmes like NAPA, which only goes to LDCs”. Tuvalu had met targets so that Tuvalu was to graduate from LDC status. Prime minister, Enele Sopoaga wants the United Nations to reconsider its criteria for graduation from LDC status as not enough weight is given to the environmental plight of small island states like Tuvalu. Sopoaga said that:

:“The present application of those criteria we feel is totally unrealistic and perhaps very very wrong. We need to address that. The application of the current criteria - we have no problem with the criteria but the application - Environmental Vulnerability Index must be one of the two.”

On 18 February 2016 Tuvalu signed the Pacific Islands Development Forum Charter and formally joined the Pacific Islands Development Forum (PIDF). In June 2017, Tuvalu signed the Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations (PACER).

==Climate change mitigation and cyclone recovery programs==

The South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission (SOPAC) suggests that, while Tuvalu is vulnerable to climate change, environmental problems such as population growth and poor coastal management also affect sustainable development. SOPAC ranks the country as extremely vulnerable using the Environmental Vulnerability Index. Tuvalu&#x27;s National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) describes a response to the climate change problem as using the combined efforts of several local bodies on each island that will work with the local community leaders (the Falekaupule). The main office, named the Department of Environment, is responsible for coordinating the non-governmental organizations, religious bodies, and stakeholders. Each of the named groups are responsible for implementing Tuvalu&#x27;s NAPA, the main plan to adapt to the adverse effects of human use and climate change.

The establishment of the A$5 million Tuvalu Survival Fund (TSF) in the 2016 Tuvaluan budget was intended for climate change mitigation and the recovery expenses that followed the impact of Cyclone Pam, which impacted Tuvalu in 2015.

The Tuvalu Coastal Adaptation Project (TCAP) was launched in 2017 for the purpose of enhancing the resilience of the islands of Tuvalu to meet the challenges resulting from higher sea levels. Tuvalu was the first country in the Pacific to access climate finance from Green Climate Fund, with the support of the UNDP. In December 2022, work on the Funafuti reclamation project commenced. The project is to dredge sand from the lagoon to construct a platform on Fongafale, Funafuti that is 780 meters long and 100 meters wide, which is designed to remain above sea level rise and the reach of storm waves beyond the year 2100. The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) also provided funding for the TCAP. Further projects that are part of TCAP are capital works on the outer islands of Nanumea and Nanumaga aimed at reducing exposure to coastal damage resulting from storms.

On 26 September 2023, the World Bank (WB) approved US$11.5 million (AUD$18 million) in new grant financing to Tuvalu as part of the WB’s First Climate and Disaster Resilience Development Policy Financing program. This WB support includes a development policy grant of US$7.5 million (AU$11.8 million). This grant is directed to assisting Tuvalu&#x27;s National Disaster Management Office in coordinating post-disaster response activities; as well to the work of Tuvalu’s National Building Code Assessment Unit, of the Public Works Department, to develop more disaster-resilient infrastructure in Tuvalu. The WB program includes an additional Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option (Cat DDO) of US$4 million (AU$6.3 million). The Cat DDO funds are made available to Tuvalu in the event of a natural disaster. The purpose of the WB grant is to support improved monitoring and reporting for the assessment of Tuvalu’s climate and disaster risks, and to help the government fast-track the flow of critical supplies to the islands of Tuvalu following emergencies and natural disasters.

<doc id="57007" wikidata="Q2622819" url="?curid=57007" title="Economy of the Comoros">
<text>The economy of the Comoros is based on subsistence agriculture and fishing. Comoros has inadequate transportation links, a young and rapidly increasing population, and few natural resources. The low educational level of the labor force contributes to a subsistence level of economic activity, high unemployment, and a heavy dependence on foreign grants and technical assistance. The Comoros, with an estimated gross domestic product (GDP) per capita income of about $700, is among the world&#x27;s poorest and least developed nations. Although the quality of the land differs from island to island, most of the widespread lava-encrusted soil formations are unsuited to agriculture. As a result, most of the inhabitants make their living from subsistence agriculture and fishing. Average wages in 2007 hover around $3–4 per day.

Agriculture, including fishing, hunting, and forestry, is the leading sector of the economy. It contributes 40% to GDP, employs 80% of the labor force, and provides most of the exports. The country is not self-sufficient in food production; rice, the main staple, accounts for the bulk of imports.

The government is working to upgrade education and technical training, to privatize commercial and industrial enterprises, to improve health services, to diversify exports, to promote tourism, and to reduce the high population growth rate. Continued foreign support is essential if the goal of 4% annual GDP growth is to be met. At 24 percent of GDP, remittances constitute an important source of inflows for the Comorian economy.

The GDP per capita of the Comoros grew 55% in the 1980s. But this proved unsustainable and it consequently shrank by 42% in the 1990s.

==Economic history==

During the colonial period, the French and local leading citizens established plantations to grow cash crops for export. Even after independence, French companies, such as Société Bambao and Établissements Grimaldi — and other concerns, such as Kalfane and Company and later, President Abdallah&#x27;s Établissements Abdallah et Fils—dominated the Comoran economy. These firms diverted most of their profits overseas, investing little in the infrastructure of the islands beyond what was needed for profitable management of the plantations, or what could benefit these businesses&#x27; associates or related concerns. A serious consequence of this approach has been the languishing of the food-crop agricultural sector and the resultant dependence on overseas food imports, particularly rice. In 1993 the Comoros remained hostage to fluctuating prices on the international market for such crops as vanilla, ylang-ylang, and cloves.

The Comoros is one of the world&#x27;s poorest countries; its per capita gross national product (GNP—see Glossary) was estimated at US$400 in 1994, following the January devaluation of the Comorian franc. Although GNP increased in real terms at an average annual rate of 3.1 percent during the 1980s, rapid population growth effaced these gains and caused an average annual decrease in per capita GNP of 0.6 percent. Gross domestic product (GDP—see Glossary) grew in real terms by 4.2 percent per year from 1980 to 1985, 1.8 percent from 1985 to 1988, and 1.5 percent in 1990. In 1991, because of its balance of payments difficulties, the Comoros became eligible for the IDA&#x27;s Special Program of Assistance for debt-distressed countries of sub-Saharan Africa.

The economy is based on private ownership, frequently by foreign investors. Nationalization, even during the Soilih years, has been limited. Soilih did expropriate the facilities of a foreign oil company, but only after the government of Madagascar took over the company&#x27;s plants in that country. The Abdallah government, despite its openness to foreign participation in the economy, nationalized the Société Bambao and another French-capitalized firm, the Comoran Meat Company (Société Comorienne des Viandes—Socovia), which specialized in sales of meat and other foods in the islands. The nationalization was short-lived, however, because Socovia and other government-held enterprises were either liquidated or privatized as part of economic restructuring efforts in 1992.

Following the Abdallah regime&#x27;s rapprochement with France in 1978, the Comoran economy became increasingly dependent on infusions of French aid, along with assistance from other governments and international organizations. By 1990, the year the Comoros concluded negotiations with the IMF for an economic restructuring program, the republic&#x27;s total external public debt was US$162.4 million, an amount equal to about three-quarters of GNP. The government delayed implementing the structural adjustment plan and was directed by the World Bank and the IMF to do so by September 1992. The plan recommendations entailed discharging about 2,800 of 9,000 civil servants, among other unpopular measures. The IMF granted the Comoros a new credit for US$1.9 million in March 1994 under the Structural Adjustment Facility. For the period 1994–96, the Comoros sought an economic growth rate of 4 percent as well as an inflation rate of 4 percent for 1995–96. The growth rate for 1994, however, was estimated only at 0.7 percent and the inflation rate at 15 percent. Meanwhile, in a move designed to encourage private enterprise and reduce unemployment, in May 1993 the UN Development Programme had given the Comoros a credit of US$2 million for programs in these areas. In January 1994, the European Development Fund (EDF) granted 1.3 million European Currency Units (ECUs; for value, see Glossary) to the Comoros to develop small businesses. The Comoros also received 5.7 million French francs from the French Aid and Cooperation Fund for agriculture and rural development.

The results of foreign aid to the Comoros have been mixed at best. The purposes of the aid ranged from helping the government cover its payroll for such huge, seemingly endless projects as expanding the seaport at Moroni and developing a new port at Mutsamuda on Nzwani. Neither project had shown much promise by early 1994. Meanwhile, the islands have been unable to develop local resources or create the infrastructure needed for economic development. The few successes included the creation of national news media and limited improvements in public health, education, and telecommunications. Developmental assistance from the United States, which totaled US$700,000 in fiscal year (FY—see Glossary) 1991, was administered by CARE, the nongovernmental organization, and focused primarily on reforestation, soil conservation, and sustainable agriculture.

The Comoros has officially participated in the African Franc Zone (Communauté Financière Africaine—CFA; see Glossary) since 1979. The CFA franc was qualed one French franc.

A national labor organization, the Union of Comoran Workers (Union des Travailleurs des Comores), also had headquarters in Moroni. Strikes and worker demonstrations often occurred in response to political crises, economic restructuring mandated by international financial organizations, and the failure of the government — occasionally for months at a time — to pay civil servants. Mean wages were $0.80 per man-hour in 2009.

==Agriculture, fishing, and forestry==

Agriculture, involving more than 80% of the population and 40% of the gross domestic product, provides virtually all foreign exchange earnings. Services including tourism, construction, and commercial activities constitute the remainder of the GDP. Plantations engage a large proportion of the population in producing the islands&#x27; major cash crops for export: vanilla, cloves, perfume essences, and copra. The Comoros is the world&#x27;s leading producer of essence of ylang-ylang, used in manufacturing perfume. It also is the world&#x27;s second-largest producer of vanilla, after Madagascar. Principal food crops are coconuts, bananas, and cassava. Foodstuffs constitute 32% of total imports.

===Agriculture and livestock===
Agriculture supported about 80 percent of the population and supplied about 95 percent of exports in the early 1990s. Two agricultural zones are generally defined: the coastal area, which ranges in elevation from sea level to 400 meters and which supports cash crops such as vanilla, ylang-ylang, and cloves; and the highlands, which support cultivation of crops for domestic consumption, such as cassava, bananas, rain rice, and sweet potatoes. As the population increased, food grown for domestic use met fewer and fewer of Comorans&#x27; needs. Data collected by the World Bank showed that food production per capita fell about 12 percent from 1980 to 1987. The republic imported virtually all its meat and vegetables; rice imports alone often accounted for up to 30 percent of the value of all imports.

The Comoros is the world&#x27;s principal producer of ylang-ylang essence, an essence derived from the flowers of a tree originally brought from Indonesia that is used in manufacturing perfumes and soaps. Ylang-ylang essence is a major component of Chanel No. 5, the popular scent for women. The republic is the world&#x27;s second largest producer of vanilla, after Madagascar. Cloves are also an important cash crop. A total of 237 tons of vanilla was exported in 1991, at a price of about CF19 per kilogram. A total of 2,750 tons of cloves was exported in 1991, at a price of CF397 per kilogram. That year forty-three tons of ylang-ylang essence were exported at a price of about CF23,000 per kilogram. The production of all three commodities fluctuates wildly, mainly in response to changes in global demand and natural disasters such as cyclones. Profits—and therefore, government receipts—likewise skyrocket and plummet, wreaking havoc with government efforts to predict revenues and plan expenditures. Stabex (Stabilization of Export Earnings—see Glossary), a system of the EC, provides aid to the Comoros and other developing countries to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in the prices of export commodities.

Long-term prospects for the growth and stabilization of the markets for vanilla and ylang-ylang did not appear strong in the early 1990s. Vanilla faced increased competition from synthetic flavorings, and the preferences of perfume users were moving away from the sweet fragrance provided by ylang-ylang essence. Copra, the dried coconut meat that yields coconut oil, once an important Comoran export, had ceased to be a significant factor in the economy by the late 1980s, when the world&#x27;s tastes shifted from high-fat coconut oil toward &quot;leaner&quot; substances such as palm oil. Although clove production and revenues also experienced swings, in the early 1990s cloves did not appear to face the same sorts of challenges confronting vanilla and ylang-ylang. Most Comoran vanilla is grown on Njazidja; Nzwani is the source of most ylangylang.

Numerous international programs have attempted to reduce the country&#x27;s dependence on food imports, particularly of rice, a major drain on export earnings. Organizations initiating these rural development programs have included the EDF, the IFAD, the World Food Program, the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, and the governments of France and the United States. Despite these international efforts, which numbered as many as seventeen in 1984, food production per capita actually declined in the Comoros during the 1980s. The major clove and vanilla growers, whose plantations occupy the islands&#x27; fertile coastal lands, generally resisted these restructuring efforts, as did rice-importing firms, including the country&#x27;s largest, Établissements Abdallah et Fils.

Crowded onto the mountain slopes by the cash crop plantations, food-crop farmers have caused deforestation and the erosion of the highlands&#x27; thin, fragile soil. In response, aid providers have dedicated an increasing amount of agricultural assistance to reforestation, soil restoration, and environmentally sensitive means of cultivation. For example, all United States agricultural aid in 1991 (US$700,000) was directed to such projects, as was a US$4 million loan from the IFAD to help initiate a small producers&#x27; support program on Nzwani.

The livestock sector is small—some 47,000 cattle, 120,000 goats, 13,000 sheep, and 4,000 asses in 1990. The Comoros continues to import most domestically consumed meat.

===Fishing===
Since the latter part of the 1980s, the Comoros has made headway in developing fisheries as a source of export earnings. In 1988 the government concluded a three-year agreement with the EC by which forty French and Spanish vessels would be permitted to fish in Comoran waters, primarily for tuna. In return, the Comoros would receive ECU300,000, and ECU50,000 would be invested in fisheries research. In addition, fishing vessel operators would pay ECU20 per ton of tuna netted. Although the deep waters outside the islands&#x27; reefs do not abound in fish, it has been estimated that up to 30,000 tons of fish could be taken per year from Comoran waters (which extend 320 kilometers offshore). The total catch in 1990 was 5,500 tons. Japan has also provided aid to the fishing industry. Fisheries development is overseen by a state agency, the Development Company for Small-Scale Fisheries of the Comoros (Société de Développement de la Pêche Artisanale des Comores).

===Forestry===
Forested areas amounted to about in 2000. Numerous fruit trees and tropical hardwoods are found. Some timber is produced, notably on the island of Grande Comore, which has about half the remaining forest. Roundwood production in 2003 amounted to 9,000 cu m (300,000 cu ft).

==Industry==
Industrial activities are responsible for only a tiny portion of Comoran economic activity—about 5 percent of GDP in 1994. Principal industries are those that involve processing cash crops for export: preparing vanilla and distilling ylang-ylang into perfume essence. These activities were once controlled almost entirely by French companies, but as they closed unprofitable plantations, individual farmers set up many small, inefficient distilleries.

Comorans also produce handicrafts for export.

Other industries are small and geared to internal markets: sawmills, printing, carpentry, and the production of shoes, plastics, yogurt, handicrafts (such as the jewelry exchanged as part of the grand marriage), and small fishing boats.

Several factors provide major obstacles to the growth of industry: the islands&#x27; geographically isolated position, their distance from each other, a scarcity of raw materials and skilled labor, and the high cost of electricity (energy is produced by hydropower, imported petroleum, and wood products) and transportation. Value added in industry slowly declined throughout the 1980s.

==Tourism==

Perhaps the primary outcome of South African penetration of the Comoran economy during Ahmed Abdallah&#x27;s regime was the development of tourism. Although South African investors built or renovated several hotels during the 1980s (with assistance from the South African and Comoran governments), only one resort, the 182-room Galawa Beach on Njazidja, was operating by late 1992. About 100 other hotel rooms were available on the islands. Political instability, a declining South African interest in the islands as the apartheid regime was disassembled and other tropical tourism venues became more welcoming, and the need to import most construction materials and consumable supplies inhibited the growth of tourism, despite the islands&#x27; physical beauty. Nonetheless, in large part thanks to Galawa Beach, which had been closed during 1990, tourism increased from 7,627 visitors in 1990 to 16,942 in 1991. Most of these tourists were Europeans, primarily French (see Historical Setting, this ch.).

==Infrastructure==
The country lacks the infrastructure necessary for development. Some villages are not linked to the main road system or at best are connected by tracks usable only by four-wheel-drive vehicles. The islands&#x27; ports are rudimentary, although a deepwater facility was recently completed on Anjouan. Only small vessels can approach the existing quays in Moroni on Grande Comore, despite recent improvements. Long-distance, ocean-going ships must lie offshore and be unloaded by smaller boats; during the cyclone season, this procedure is dangerous, and ships are reluctant to call at the island. Most freight is sent first to Mombasa or Réunion and transshipped from there.

The banking system consists of the Central Bank of the Comoros (Banque Centrale des Comores) established in 1981 that had three offices (Moroni (Grande-Comore), Mutsamudu (Anjouan) and Fomboni (Mohéli)); the Banque pour l&#x27;Industrie et le Commerce des Comores, a commercial bank established in 1990 that had six branches in 1993 and was a subsidiary of the Banque Nationale de Paris; the Development Bank of the Comoros (Banque de Développement des Comores), established in 1982, which provided support for small and midsize development projects, the Federal Bank of Commerce (Banque Fédérale de Commerce) and the Exim Bank Comores Ltd. Most of the shares in the Development Bank of the Comoros were held by the Comoran government and the central bank; the rest were held by the European Investment Bank and the Caisse Centrale de Coopération Économique, a development agency of the French government. All of these banks had headquarters in Moroni.

==External trade==
France, the Comoros&#x27; major trading partner, finances small projects only. The United States receives a growing percentage of the Comoros&#x27; exports but supplies only a negligible fraction of its imports (less than 1%).

The overall effect of the republic&#x27;s dependence on aid has been perennial trade deficits accompanied by chronic budget deficits. In 1992 total exports had a value of US$21 million, and total imports were valued at US$50 million. In 1991 receipts totaled about US$34.7 million (CF9.7 trillion; CF—Comoran franc; for value of the Comoran franc—see Glossary) whereas expenditures totaled about US$93.8 million (CF26.2 trillion). The shortfall, which equaled about 170 percent of receipts, was financed by international grants and loans, by draws upon existing lines of credit, and by debt rescheduling.

In 1991 France received 55 percent of Comoran exports, followed by the United States (19 percent) and Germany (16 percent). The main export products were vanilla, ylang-ylang, and cloves. The republic&#x27;s primary suppliers were France (56 percent of imports), the Belgium-Luxembourg economic union (11 percent), and Japan (5 percent). Imports consisted of basic foodstuffs (rice and meat), petroleum, and construction materials.

Comoros has an international airport (Prince Said Ibrahim International Airport) at Hahaya on Grande Comore. It is a member of the franc zone with an exchange rate of 491.9677 Comorian francs (KMF) = 1 [Euro].

<text>The European robin (&quot;Erithacus rubecula&quot;), known simply as the robin or robin redbreast in the British Isles, is a small insectivorous passerine bird that belongs to the Old World flycatcher family Muscicapidae. It is found across Europe, east to Western Siberia and south to North Africa; it is sedentary in the west and south of its range, and migratory in the north and east of its range where winters are harsher.

It is in length; the male and female are identical in plumage, with an orange-toned red breast and face lined with grey, brown upper-parts and a whitish belly. Juveniles are distinct, freckled brown all over and without the red breast; first-winter immatures are like the adults, except for more obvious yellow-brown tips to the wing covert feathers (inconspicuous or absent in adults).

== Etymology ==
The distinctive orange breast of both sexes contributed to the European robin&#x27;s original name of &quot;redbreast&quot;, &quot;orange&quot; as a colour name being unknown in English until the 16th century, by which time the fruit of the same name had been introduced. The Dutch , French , Swedish &quot;rödhake&quot;, German , Italian , Spanish and Portuguese all refer to the distinctively coloured front.

In the 15th century, when it became popular to give human names to familiar species, the bird came to be known as &quot;robin redbreast&quot;, which was eventually shortened to &quot;robin&quot;. As a given name, Robin is originally a smaller form of the name Robert. The term &quot;robin&quot; is also applied to some birds in other families with red or orange breasts. These include the American robin (&quot;Turdus migratorius&quot;, a thrush) and the Australasian robins of the family Petroicidae, the relationships of which are unclear.

Other older English names for the bird include &quot;ruddock&quot; and &quot;robinet&quot;. In American literature of the late 19th century, this robin was frequently called the &quot;English robin&quot;.

== Taxonomy and systematics ==
The European robin was described by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the 10th edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Motacilla rubecula&quot;. Its specific epithet &quot;rubecula&quot; is a diminutive derived from the Latin , meaning &#x27;red&#x27;. The genus &quot;Erithacus&quot; was described by French naturalist Georges Cuvier in 1800, giving the bird its current binomial name &quot;E. rubecula&quot;. The genus name &quot;Erithacus&quot; is from Ancient Greek and refers to an unknown bird, now usually identified as robin.

The genus &quot;Erithacus&quot; was formerly classified as a member of the thrush family (Turdidae) but is now known to belong to the Old World flycatcher family Muscicapidae. The genus formerly included the Japanese robin and the Ryukyu robin, but these east Asian species were shown in molecular phylogenetic studies to be more similar to a group of other Asian species than to the European robin; in a reorganisation of the genera, the Japanese and the Ryukyu robins were moved to the resurrected genus &quot;Larvivora&quot; leaving the European robin as the sole member of &quot;Erithacus&quot;. A 2010 phylogenetic analysis placed &quot;Erithacus&quot; in the subfamily Erithacinae, which otherwise contained only African species, but its exact position with respect to the other genera was not resolved. More detailed analysis has shown it to be the sole European member of an otherwise entirely tropical African subfamily Cossyphinae, in which it is in a basal position.

=== Subspecies ===
In their large continental Eurasian range, robins vary somewhat, but do not form discrete populations that might be considered subspecies. Robin subspecies are mainly distinguished by forming resident populations on islands and in mountainous areas. The robin found in the British Isles and much of western Europe, &quot;Erithacus rubecula melophilus&quot;, occurs as a vagrant in adjacent regions. &quot;E. r. witherbyi&quot; from northwest Africa, Corsica, and Sardinia closely resembles &quot;melophilus&quot; but has shorter wings. The northeasternmost birds, large and fairly washed-out in colour, are &quot;E. r. tataricus&quot;. In the southeast of its range, &quot;E. r. valens&quot; of the Crimean Peninsula, &quot;E. r. caucasicus&quot; of the Caucasus and northern Transcaucasia, and &quot;E. r. hyrcanus&quot; southeastwards into Iran are generally accepted as significantly distinct.

On Madeira and the Azores, the local population has been described as &quot;E. r. microrhynchos&quot;, and although not distinct in morphology, its isolation seems to suggest the subspecies is valid (but see below).

==== Canary Islands robin ====
The most distinct birds are those of Gran Canaria (&quot;E. r. marionae&quot;) and Tenerife (&quot;E. r. superbus&quot;), which may be considered two distinct species or at least two different subspecies. They are readily distinguished by a white eye-ring, an intensely coloured breast, a grey line that separates the orange-red from the brown colouration, and the belly is entirely white.

Cytochrome &quot;b&quot; sequence data and vocalisations indicate that the Gran Canaria/Tenerife robins are indeed very distinct and probably derived from colonisation by mainland birds some 2 million years ago.

Christian Dietzen, Hans-Hinrich Witt and Michael Wink published in 2003 in &quot;Avian Science&quot; a study called &quot;The phylogeographic differentiation of the European robin &quot;Erithacus rubecula&quot; on the Canary Islands revealed by mitochondrial DNA sequence data and morphometrics: evidence for a new robin taxon on Gran Canaria?&quot;. In it they concluded that Gran Canaria&#x27;s robin diverged genetically from their European relatives as far back as 2.3 million years, while the Tenerife ones took another half a million years to make this leap, 1.8 million years ago. The most likely reason would be a different colonisation of the Canaries by this bird, which arrived at the oldest island first (Gran Canaria) and subsequently passed to the neighbouring island (Tenerife).

A thorough comparison between &quot;marionae&quot; and &quot;superbus&quot; is pending to confirm that the first one is effectively a different subspecies. Initial results suggest that birds from Gran Canaria have wings about 10% shorter than those on Tenerife. The west Canary Islands&#x27; populations are younger (Middle Pleistocene) and only beginning to diverge genetically. Robins from the western Canary Islands: El Hierro, La Palma and La Gomera (&quot;E. r. microrhynchus&quot;) are similar to the European type subspecies (&quot;E. r. rubecula&quot;).

Finally, the robins which can be found in Fuerteventura are the European ones, which is not surprising as the species does not breed either in this island or in the nearby Lanzarote; they are wintering birds or just passing through during their long migration between Africa and Europe.

=== Other robins ===
The larger American robin (&quot;Turdus migratorius&quot;) is a much larger bird named from its similar colouration to the European robin, but the two birds are not closely related, with the American robin instead belonging to the same genus as the common blackbird (&quot;T. merula&quot;), a species which occupies much of the same range as the European robin. The similarity between the European and American robins lies largely in the orange chest patch found in both species. This American species was incorrectly shown &quot;feathering its nest&quot; in London in the film &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;, but it only occurs in the UK as a very rare vagrant.

Some South and Central American &quot;Turdus&quot; thrushes are also called robins, such as the rufous-collared thrush. The Australian &quot;robin redbreast&quot;, more correctly the scarlet robin (&quot;Petroica multicolor&quot;), is more closely related to crows and jays than it is to the European robin. It belongs to the family Petroicidae, whose members are commonly called &quot;Australasian robins&quot;. The red-billed leiothrix (&quot;Leiothrix lutea&quot;) is sometimes named the &quot;Pekin robin&quot; by aviculturalists. Another group of Old World flycatchers, this time from Africa and Asia, is the genus &quot;Copsychus&quot;; its members are known as magpie-robins, one of which, the Oriental magpie robin (&quot;C. saularis&quot;), is the national bird of Bangladesh.

== Description ==
The adult European robin is long and weighs , with a wingspan of . The male and female bear similar plumage: an orange breast and face (more strongly coloured in the otherwise similar British subspecies &quot;E. r. melophilus&quot;), lined by a bluish grey on the sides of the neck and chest. The upperparts are brownish, or olive-tinged in British birds, and the belly whitish, while the legs and feet are brown. The bill and eyes are black. Juveniles are a spotted brown and white in colouration, with patches of orange gradually appearing.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The robin occurs in Eurasia east to Western Siberia, south to Algeria and on the Atlantic islands as far west as the Central Group of the Azores and Madeira. It is a vagrant in Iceland. In the southeast, it reaches Iran the Caucasus range. Irish and British robins are largely resident but a small minority, usually female, migrate to southern Europe during winter, a few as far as Spain. Scandinavian and Russian robins migrate to Britain and western Europe to escape the harsher winters. These migrants can be recognised by the greyer tone of the upper parts of their bodies and duller orange breast. The continental European robins that migrate during winter prefer spruce woods in northern Europe, contrasting with its preference for parks and gardens in Great Britain.

In southern Iberia, habitat segregation of resident and migrant robins occurs, with resident robins remaining in the same woodlands where they bred.

Attempts to introduce the European robin into Australia and New Zealand in the latter part of the 19th century were unsuccessful. Birds were released around Melbourne, Auckland, Christchurch, Wellington and Dunedin by various local acclimatisation societies, with none becoming established. There was a similar outcome in North America, as birds failed to become established after being released in Long Island, New York in 1852, Oregon in 1889–1892, and the Saanich Peninsula in British Columbia in 1908–1910.

== Behaviour and ecology ==


The robin is diurnal, although it has been reported to be active hunting insects on moonlit nights or near artificial light at night. Well known to British and Irish gardeners, it is relatively unafraid of people and drawn to human activities involving the digging of soil, in order to look out for earthworms and other food freshly turned up. The British and Irish considered robins to be a gardener&#x27;s friend and would never harm them, due also to the traditional association of the red colouring of their breasts with the blood of Christ. In continental Europe, on the other hand, robins were hunted and killed as were most other small birds, and are therefore more wary. Robins also approach large wild animals, such as wild boar, which disturb the ground, to look for any food that might be brought to the surface.

In autumn and winter, robins will supplement their usual diet of terrestrial invertebrates, such as spiders, worms and insects, with berries, fruit and seeds. They will also eat seed mixtures and suet placed on bird-tables, as well as left-overs. The robin is even known to feed on small vertebrates (including fish and lizards) and carrion.

Male robins are very territorial and will fiercely attack other males and competitors that stray into their territories. They have been observed attacking other small birds without apparent provocation. There are recorded instances of robins attacking their own reflection. Territorial disputes sometimes lead to fatalities, accounting for up to 10% of adult robin deaths in some areas.

Because of high mortality in the first year of life, a robin has an average life expectancy of 1.1 years; however, once past its first year, life expectancy increases. One robin has been recorded as reaching 19 years of age. A spell of very low temperatures in winter can, however, result in higher mortality rates. The species is parasitised by the moorhen flea (&quot;Dasypsyllus gallinulae&quot;) and the acanthocephalan &quot;Apororhynchus silesiacus&quot;.

=== Breeding ===
Robins may choose a wide variety of sites for building a nest. In fact, anything which can offer some shelter, like a depression or hole, may be considered. As well as the usual crevices, or sheltered banks, other objects include pieces of machinery, barbecues, bicycle handlebars, bristles on upturned brooms, discarded kettles, watering cans, flower pots and hats. Robins will also nest in manmade nest boxes, favouring a design with an open front placed in a sheltered position up to from the ground. Nests are generally composed of moss, leaves and grass, with fine grass, hair and feathers for lining.

Two or three clutches of five or six eggs are laid throughout the breeding season, which commences in March in Britain and Ireland. The eggs are a cream, buff or white speckled or blotched with reddish-brown colour, often more heavily so at the larger end. When juvenile birds fly from the nests, their colouration is entirely mottled brown. After two to three months out of the nest, the juvenile bird grows some orange feathers under its chin, and over a similar period this patch gradually extends to complete the adult appearance of an entirely red-orange breast.

=== Vocalisation ===
The robin produces a fluting, warbling during the breeding season. Both the male and female sing throughout the year, including during the winter, when they hold separate territories. During the winter, the robin&#x27;s song is more plaintive than the summer version. The female robin moves a short distance from the summer nesting territory to a nearby area that is more suitable for winter feeding. The male robin keeps the same territory throughout the year. During the breeding season, male robins usually initiate their morning song an hour before civil sunrise, and usually terminate their daily singing around thirty minutes after sunset. Nocturnal singing can also occur, especially in urban areas that are artificially lit during the night. Some urban robins opt to sing at night to avoid daytime anthropogenic noise.

=== Magnetoreception ===
The avian magnetic compass of the robin has been extensively researched and uses vision-based magnetoreception, in which the robin&#x27;s ability to sense the magnetic field of the Earth for navigation is affected by the light entering the bird&#x27;s eye. The physical mechanism of the robin&#x27;s magnetic sense involves quantum entanglement of electron spins in cryptochrome in the bird&#x27;s eyes.

== Conservation status ==
The European robin has an extensive range and a population numbering in the hundreds of millions. The species does not approach the vulnerable thresholds under the population trend criterion (&gt;30 per cent decline over ten years or three generations); the population appears to be increasing. The International Union for Conservation of Nature evaluates it as least concern.

== Cultural depictions ==
The robin features prominently in British folklore and that of northwestern France, but much less so in other parts of Europe,
though in the nineteenth century Jacob Grimm reported a tradition from German-speaking Europe that if someone disturbed a robin&#x27;s nest their house would be struck by lightning. Robins feature in the traditional children&#x27;s tale &quot;Babes in the Wood&quot;; the birds cover the dead bodies of the children.

The robin has become strongly associated with Christmas, taking a starring role on many Christmas cards since the mid-19th century.
The robin has appeared on many Christmas postage stamps. An old British folk tale seeks to explain the robin&#x27;s distinctive breast. Legend has it that when Jesus was dying on the cross, the robin, then simply brown in colour, flew to his side and sang into his ear in order to comfort him in his pain. The blood from his wounds stained the robin&#x27;s breast, and thereafter all robins carry the mark of Christ&#x27;s blood upon them.

An alternative legend has it that its breast was scorched fetching water for souls in Purgatory. The association with Christmas more probably arises from the fact that postmen in Victorian Britain wore red jackets and were nicknamed &quot;Robins&quot;; the robin featured on the Christmas card is an emblem of the postman delivering the card.

In the 1960s, in a vote publicised by &quot;The Times&quot;, the robin was adopted as the unofficial national bird of the United Kingdom.
In 2015, the robin was again voted Britain&#x27;s national bird in a poll organised by birdwatcher David Lindo, taking 34% of the final vote.

Several English and Welsh sports organisations are nicknamed &quot;the Robins&quot;. The nickname is typically used for teams whose home colours predominantly use red. These include the professional football clubs Bristol City, Crewe Alexandra, Swindon Town, Cheltenham Town and, traditionally, Wrexham A.F.C., as well as the English rugby league team the Hull Kingston Rovers (whose home colours are white with a red band). As of 2019, Bristol City, Swindon Town and Cheltenham Town also incorporate a robin image in their current badge designs. A small bird is an unusual choice, although it is thought to symbolise agility in darting around the field.
